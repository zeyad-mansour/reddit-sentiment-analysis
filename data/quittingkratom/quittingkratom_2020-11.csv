I'm at about 72 hours since the final dose and my withdrawals are minimal. Like 3/10 at worst. More like 2/10 really. This is a nice surprise so far.

I have been taking kratom for about 5 years. The last two years at about 20-30g per day. I tapered over about 45 days. The first drop was the biggest. I set my dose at 2g every 3 hours. Then every week, I dropped the dose by 0.25g

There was some discomfort for the first week but nothing terrible. Then some mild discomfort at each drop.

I was expecting worse at 72 hours though. Actually, I feel pretty good right now. Is it possible that it won't get worse? From reading on the forum, most people have the worst withdrawals on days 3 and 4. But again, I feel pretty good right now.

When I quit, my last doses were at 0.75g every 4 hours (though often I pushed past the 4 hour mark.)",9

2020-11-29 14:16:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/k3fb4o/massive_kratom_detox/,Massive Kratom Detox,"I used kratom after getting addicted to prescribed medication (10mg hydrocodone for years). My doctor prescribed them for cluster headaches along with Fiorcet w/ codeine. Long story short I got tired of taking pills and found kratom. Changed doctors who was shocked that I was prescribed pain pills for CH. 

It was a lifesaver (kratom) until it landed me in the hospital. I was taking 10g 3x a day or more and began to be unable to eat. my tolerance was so high I’d just eat the powder and wash it down. My potassium levels dropped to critical and I couldn’t even think and had a panic attack and then a seizure. I cracked my head and got my head stapled (admitted to taking kratom so labeled drug user no pain meds). 

I spent a week in the hospital and all the doctors said it was kratom. I even tested positive for adderall but never took it. Tainted kratom maybe or false positive. The doctors said its unregulated and you could have taken anything. 

more ranting ...  I was clean for a while but forced to see a shrink who is very nice and has me on prosac and abilify. I get urges to buy kratom as they sell it everywhere here. I get very bored easily and focusing is hard without it. I just caved 2 weeks ago and blew through 250g. I’m day 8 clean cold turkey and getting the withdrawal waves. I feel like shit that I caved in after such a traumatic experience which gave me PTSD. I can deal with it, I did it to myself. 

Is it me or do people also get extreme anxiety and shaky when stopping. Its embarrassing holding a fork and feeling likeI have parkinsons. I can tolerate the physical pain but I need to function to work. I don’t want to ever be hospitalized again. 

I also get a lot of flank for saying kratom caused this. I pulled my hospital records and they even did a study based on me with kratom causing hyperkalcemia extremely low K+ (potassium). so i truly was a guinea  pig for a kratom study. 

Still getting bored very easily but feel like I’m getting over it and now I don’t use anything for cluster headaches. They hurt really bad but strangely increasing my breathing makes them subside fast. 

Good luck everyone. I truly feel for anyone dealing with this shit. The benefits get blown out of the water after the negatives.

(Some days are still better than others),"For you in the first few days, I have this theory it’s all about staying busy through your withdrawal. (As much as your body will let you) Its YOUR recovery. You GOT this. It’s my first time quitting CT for 18 days. I had to quit after ending up in the hospital but honestly it was one of the BEST things that ever happened to me. I feel more. I laugh more. I definitely cry more lol but usual happy tears. Im about to go bike ride the trail by my house this afternoon and blast some beautiful music and I feel those lyrics even more now too.

I know some of you have had it a lot harder than I did. a lot more experience with K then I did. I was only one it for 2+ years. I do not claim to be an expert on this whole quiting Kratom thing. I’m a 28 year old female who is fairly active who started Kratom and got totally addicted to how social it made me feel. All the energy I suddenly had!! Made me feel invincible. But it in the end, it just ended up numbing up my entire brain. Only feeling an actually living breathing human when I had this shit pulsing through my veins. Wake up. K. Two hours in. K. Two more hours. K and so on and so on before I could pass out. I now no longer live as Kratoms Captor. And that feeels DAMN AMAZING. 

(For all of your going through this withdrawal just know it’s only temporary and you will feel again and love again and laugh again and smile)

I love you all and hope you are all making the best of this beautiful Sunday!!

On Thanksgiving Day I was struck with some boredom and restlessness.  My old self would have reached for some red vein but I didn't.  

I proceeded to ride 50 miles on my mountain bike along a gravel trail.  I decided to replace the suck with something that sucked more and I loved it.  I could barely walk afterwards, my butt was sore 15 miles in and went numbish enough to be a relief about 30 miles in.  The last 5 miles my right knee hurt so much I could barely pedal.  

I slept well that night after eating way too much for Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house.  I was pretty much sore and bedridden the next morning.   I wondered it that was a good idea given minimal training.  

The next day after ample dosing of ibuprofen I decided that it would be a good idea to take a short 6 mile bike ride to the park just to see if I could do it.  This bike ride turned into a 26 mile ride.  I was going to go farther but my right knee started hurting again and I turned back.  By the last 2 miles only my left leg was doing any pedaling, my right knee in excruciating pain just along for the ride.  

Embrace the suck my friends.  You don't know what you can do unless you do it.  The pain shall pass and your body will heal.  Train your mind to be hard.",12

Thanks to the gradual taper my acute symptoms have been incredibly mild, and by this point non-existent.

Two days ago I made plans to go hiking with my friends, around 12 - 4 pm, which of course is unacceptable because 3:30 pm is my afternoon dose time, and what, would I pop a capsule while we're hiking? Wait until I get home? What if, god forbid, they wanted to get a beer afterwards? That would mean--WAIT! Wait wait wait! This isn't a thing anymore! I can do whatever the hell I want, whenever the hell I want! And yesterday, I got hungrier for lunch than usual, which is obviously a problem because lunch time is dose time and--NOPE! Not a thing anymore! And then later in the day I felt like a cup of tea but obviously you gotta wait to have a tea with your dose because--NEVERMIND! Not a thing! Just pop the kettle on if and when I want a cuppa!

I'm going kayaking with my friends later today and I don't particularly give a shit when we launch, because my days belong to me now, not kratom.

My fiance is back home, and it has been fantastic to spend time with her.  It's funny how this has gone.  I put on a necklace my friend gave me the night I quit, the pendant says ""When you feel like giving up, remember why you started"", because I was so afraid of doing this again.  I was worried I wouldn't stick with it.  Sticky notes on the wall reminding myself I can do this.  But looking back, the fear I had about doing this was rather silly.  No, it wasn't a fun time, but it was so doable.  I owe the strength I had during my early days to others.

I had probably had it for a few days as I had mild congestion/scratchy throat on and off. Anyway I need to quarantine through Friday. I feel mostly fine - was exhausted all day Thursday (only awake for about 2 hours total), to a lesser extend Friday. Have felt fine yesterday and so far today. I know it can turn a corner quickly so I’m resting most of the day in my bedroom. I’m isolating from my husband and daughter who tested negative. 

I attempted to quit Kratom a month or two ago and made it 4 days, relapsed, 4 more days, relapsed, 2 days, then relapse until now. I have been using 1/3-1/2 of what I was using before that quit. I have about a days worth of Kratom left and am probably just going to quit. I can’t go to the store since I’m COVID+ and I’m isolating so would be able to handle withdrawal if I have any. I’m not scheduled to work again until January (we are traveling for Christmas and going to quarantine before and after travel) so it would be a good time. My new year’s resolution last year was to quit Kratom. So I should do it before the new year. We are also trying to get pregnant so that is a factor as well.

I have been a user for many years to varying degrees.  The real issues came when my dose and frequency became the norm.  I used shots and capsules.  I was probably around 20g a day at the end.  I quit a while back and made it several weeks.  Then I broke my streak, and slowly ended right back where I was.  

The first few days were difficult,  my neck was super tight and it caused a lot of headaches and discomfort.   The other common issue was sleep.  Fortunately,  both of those issues seem to be much better.

I've always been a gym guy and an lean, maybe that made my withdrawals not as bad as some others have experienced.  

Quitting isn't really the difficult part imo.  Its staying quit in the long term that gets tricky.  The addict in you is clever and knows your weaknesses.   Ocassional thoughts like ""its been a while, it will feel like it did in the beginning"" or ""you don't need it all the time, an ocassional reward cant hurt. ""  of course these are lies.  Cracks in the ice of your will.  If any of that were true we would not be here in the first place.

I plan to begin a meditation routine, something I havent done in years.  I will also go back to reading books of a spiritual nature.  Our problems don't cause our grief or suffering,  the power we give those things does.  Its an easy thing to say, but not an easy thing to truly embrace.  This is just something I was thinking is worth doing, it has no downside or risk of loss.  

We can all do this thing.  We are all on the same boat and know which way ship needs to go.  Let's do what needs to be done and be free ourselves of this burden.  We're worth it!",26

After a great thanksgiving that started with some deep breathing and a 3 mile walk, I became less vigilant. I all but stopped deep breathing until this morning. Didn’t take a cold shower for 3 days and didn’t get out for brisk walks. Figured it’s the holiday weekend and I can do without the regimentation. 

Man, I was feeling so down and lonely and isolated it was terrible. Questioning what is the point of continuing on like this because using takes away these feelings. A very dangerous spot and a familiar one as well unfortunately. This morning though I woke around 730 - immediately grabbed my headphones and did my deep breathing and then into the shower, with a 45 second cold ending and ready for the day. 

A stark reminder that recovery isn’t just when you feel like it or it is convenient. It needs to be a priority. I don’t think it always has to be an all encompassing focus of your life but to remove the focus completely - that leads down a dark path we all know all too well.

I’ve been a lurker on this sub for awhile. I am (or was) a recovering benzo addict (prescribed from age 5 to 21 (yep, you read that right), got clean, then got into alcohol while dealing with extreme abuse, ptsd, personal stress, etc. then was told by an ex-heroin addict that kratom was a non-addictive alternative and ‘a supplement’. Been addicted and have not gone a day without it ever since (for over a year and a half now). I began on the powder but switched to the extract shots earlier this year as my tolerance was getting crazy and it wasn’t ‘doing it’ for me anymore. The powder doesn’t even touch me anymore and I get sick without extracts now. I spend about $300 a week on shots alone and it’s so embarrassing considering most people have never heard of this shit. If I go 24 hours without at least one extract shot, I’m violently ill with the typical stomach symptoms to spare the tmi, irritability, etc...full on withdrawal symptoms. Myself, like the majority of others, fell for the “kratom is a non addictive substitute to keep you clean. It’s no more addictive than coffee!” bullshit when in reality, it is highly underestimated and is just a very mild opiate-like substitute which is crazy and humiliating for something I buy at the fucking gas station. To make matters worse, I am back on benzos and fully addicted to those as well again but not prepared to experience the withdrawal of both as it would be obvious hell. This has been a nightmare and more people need to know that it is quite literally a drug. It used to get me high..it felt like a light opiate, If I’m lucky, it still does have a little effect occasionally but really, I just take it to feel normal and to not get sick. I got conned into the ‘herbal supplement’ misconception. It’s not like I can go to an NA meeting for a Kratom addiction. I don’t know quite where else to turn. Sorry for this rambling mess.",3

My social life was non existent. My antidepressants were just taking the edge off. I wasn't happy. Then I started looking for mood elevators.

Kratom seemed to be a good logical choice. I tried it and found it worked, but it worked too well at first. The lost of negative emotions made me very relaxed with things such as money and my sobriety.

I relapsed on alcohol Adderall and of course kratom.

I started using every other weekend. That lasted a six months. Then I worked up to a daily used. Now I am 15 to 20 grams a day.

It was a very big part of my life before I quit, but for many of the same reasons that many former kratomites quit, I had to remove kratom from my life.  [I already made a post discussing the stages of quitting](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/bymj6r/the_phases_of_quitting_kratom_a_personal/) as well as the zombie-like state that we eventually reach when our kratom habit gets out of control, and the progression from kratom helping us thrive to eventually making us worse off due to tolerance, side effects and ruining our natural reward system. I still browse this subreddit to keep myself reminded of the negative effects of kratom and to see how my experience compared to others because like many of you, I still catch kratom-wasnt-that-bad-for-me-itis. So in the spirit of staying off of the green sludge, let's talk about one of the things that kratom likes to mess with and cling to even after quitting. 


**Sleep Quality**


One thing that I think a lot of us quitters complain about that may make newcomers hesitant to quit is the lack of sleep during withdrawals, and even some lingering sleep quality issues later on due to PAWS. Although this aspect of recovery is challenging, I think that it is easy to forget how much sleep quality was affected while you were still taking kratom. I think that one of the most significant things that kratom affected for me personally was my overall sleep quality, especially towards the end of my binge when my doses grew in size. Surprisingly though, it can be easy to forget what havoc kratom caused, or downplay the effect it had on your sleep, especially when you aren't sleeping that well post-kratom life. It is helpful to keep our perspective on what ""kratom-sleep"" was actually like, and that bad ""sober-sleep"" might not be as bad as you think it is. 


**Kratom-Sleep**


In the beginning, kratom was great for sleep. It helped get me into a relaxed state so that I could lay down and doze off. This was actually one of the best benefits for me early in my life as a kratomite, and only came second to the social energy that it gave me early on. This of course did not last however, as we get deeper into the kratom habit, we tend to process the kratom faster and therefore go into withdrawals much quicker. At this later point, I had no trouble falling asleep while on kratom, but STAYING asleep without waking up for the middle-of-the-night dose was near impossible. I am sure that many of you are familiar with the physiological 3 a.m. wake-up call from your body to dose so that you can get back to sleep for a few hours. You know, those nights where you wake up with that wired-n-tired feeling, like your body is still exhausted but your kratom-deprived mind is racing. There were usually only three routes to go from this situation: 

* Take another dose and hopefully fall back asleep for a few hours - wake up feeling about 75% normal. 
* Do nothing, stay awake and feel completely awful for the day. 
* Try taking another dose as already mentioned, but fail to fall back asleep. Feel completely awful for the day. 


Usually this situation would be fine; take a dose and let it kick in for an hour and fall back asleep before that alarm clock goes off. Not a big deal right? However, what about those days that you couldn't get back to sleep? Those mornings when maybe you didn't wake up in withdrawal until 5:00 am, and your alarm was set for 6:00 am, and you couldn't fall back asleep in time even after re-dosing. Do you remember how that day went? How did you feel?


For me this meant a day with a deep feeling of dark worthlessness; a feeling of being completely detached from my normal personality. I tried everything I could to help get through these days and nothing aside from more sleep would help. Coffee just made me jittery, more kratom helped a little with the anxiety but not with that detached, drained feeling. My voice would sound different those days and my facial expressions were blank. It's like I was walking around with a bubble of negative energy and I couldn't escape. My thoughts were only negative, and anything that would normally be a positive experience that day was re-framed by my brain as a negative experience. I remember it feeling almost physically impossible to smile and all I wanted to do was hide in my room until the feeling went away, but unfortunately my job required an up-beat personality and interacting with many people. Co-workers and friends that I would typically joke back and forth with would now make me upset for no reason, as I was super irritable in this state. These kratom-induced days of depression pushed away people that I was closest too. It was literally hell when I was in this kratom-induced depression.


**Bad Sober-Sleep**


Okay, so now that we have relived our days ruined by kratom withdrawals - how does poor ""sober-sleep"" compare to that? I was never a good sleeper to begin with, and I have developed quite the bed-time routine to help make sure I get a good night's rest. I use white noise, foam ear plugs and a room temperature of 68 degrees to sleep properly; but even all of this doesn't always guarantee a full night's rest. 


However, now a poor day of sleeping just means that I am tired (gasp). A little less upbeat, but still able to pull in positive thoughts if I work on it. I am still not 100% ""me"" when I don't get a good night's rest, but I am not in the hell that withdrawal-induced sleeplessness caused. I  can drink some coffee, do some Whim Hoff breathing, take a cold shower, listen to some 90's music on the way to work and feel ready to tackle the day. No deep feeling of darkness, anxiety and depression - at least not to the extent of kratom's version of bad sleep. I can now accept my bad days, and make it to the other side. Once this happens I always look back and think ""damn, that wasn't that bad. Imagine what I could do with a full night's rest!"" It is a completely different mindset, one that kratom robs you of. Friends, family and co-workers have all noticed the change and some have even acknowledged it, pointing out how I seem like I am more positive. 


This deep feeling of depression and anxiety made my kratomless ""bad days"" seem like a walk in the park. If waking up on the wrong side of the bed is considered a bad state then kratom-induced withdrawal related sleeplessness is like living in literal hell. These are the days that I can think back on and scare myself out of ""having just one single dose today"". It became a fear of mine, having to tread through the day in this state, and reliving that fear helps keep me from ever going back to that life. I know that this post is nothing revolutionary, but I hope that this helps remind some of you who experienced the same thing talk yourself out of that ""one"" dose.",46

I haven’t actually left bed yet but based on how I feel now the WDs seem to have abated.

I can attest to this.

Yesterday I felt emotion when thinking of a few things. My wife and I watched a drama and I straight up almost cried. (which would be unusual for me)

Right now I feel kinda okay. The depression is the hardest right now, but no cold sweats or really intense anxiety. I'm just super fucking sad.

  


I've used for one and a half year, in the end I was taking around 30 g a day and I didn't even get high anymore. I just didn't get withdrawals.

  


I'll take lyrica tomorrow and then I'll stop it. I took Kratom to not fall into a heroin addiction again. It was still a deal with the devil, but the deal was a bit smaller. I tried quitting at least 4 times, one time I did it with loperamid but used again after getting through the withdrawals, which is so stupid I can't even express it in words.

  


I got the idea with lyrica from a friend who's on methadone right now, he knows every withdrawal symptom from every drug. I really thought the withdrawals would take their time and start around 36 hours, but no, they're already here, but I'm very thankful for them just being psychological.

Since it’s Thanksgiving and I recently quit chain vaping, I thought I’d post again to encourage your efforts to quit and also share my gratitude for being free from this addiction.

At this point, my 8 year addiction to kratom seems like a bad dream. So much has happened in my life during the past 2 years. I’ve made a lot of changes and worked on improving myself in many ways. While life isn’t perfect, it’s pretty good and light years better than the misery I suffered during my kratom consuming years. 

It amazes me how long it took for me to get back to normal after quitting, how much it stunted me in mind and body, and how much better it is to be rid of it. I always thought kratom would continue to play a part in my life and the high I got from it was the only way I could make it worth loving. Of course we know that doesn’t last. Now, I can’t imagine being on it. 

Overall, my biggest regret was letting this addiction get out of hand and take over my life for so long. I now know I could’ve quit long ago and made the best out a big chunk of my 20s and 30s. There’s still time, but so much of it was lost in the green fog. You can’t get back that time, which is why it’s so important to quit and move on and spend time on the things that make life worth living. 

In case you’re interested in my usage history:

Started using December 2010.

Daily usage from mid-2011 until the proposed DEA ban in September 2016; during this time I peaked at 60 gpd and tapered down over a few months and stopped at 15 gpd. 

Quit for 3 weeks in September 2016 and started back up using Friday’s and Sunday’s only for the next year until summer 2017.

From summer 2017 to summer of 2018, I ranged from 3-4 days a week to daily usage from May 2018 to July 2018. Prior to stopping I got up to 30-40 gpd and tapered back and quit at 15 gpd. Initially I stopped for a tolerance break, but the break was so bad I decided to quit. Had a few slips until my last dose in October 2018.

Since quitting, I got a new job where I’m more fulfilled and financially secure. I ended my relationship with my ex boyfriend of 9 years who was also an addict. And, I’ve gone totally sober and worked on living a new life based on accomplishments and goals. As I mentioned before, I just quit a nearly decade long chain vaping habit two weeks ago – my last vice!

It’s been a long road. While everyone’s path is going to be different and require a unique approach, here are some of the things that led me to sobriety and living the life that both myself and YOU deserve:

1. Being sick and tired of being sick and tired - This was probably the crux of my decision to quit kratom and later go completely sober. With years of daily kratom usage, I was simply fighting off withdrawals every couple of hours. When I was coming down, I’d feel foggy, irritable, and craving another high even though I knew if I took more I’d be treated to the wobbles and have to attempt to recalibrate how I felt by eating, napping, or drinking water. Looking back from where my sober self sits now, there truly were so few times where I actually felt good. I mostly felt sick, tired, and completely disinterested in life. My existence was devoted to constantly micromanaging how I felt at all times. When I hit the depths of PAWS after my last quit, I knew nothing would get better until I finally put an end to the sludge, or else the cycle would continue. No more slip ups! I was sick of it, quit, and stuck with it to see how I would feel by not relying on something to change my mood or combat how I felt. Eventually, I bounced back. Being sick and tired of being sick and tired was what truly catapulted me to kicking kratom to the curb and moving on.

2. Transferring addiction - If you’re spending a lot of time ruminating  whether or not you can get away with using other substances after you quit kratom, you probably should dump the weed, booze, pills, or whatever else you think will take the edge off your quit. After I quit kratom, I went steady with kava for several months which began to take its toll. Then, 6 months after quitting kratom, I started drinking alcohol and began to drink more and more until I was blacking out frequently. Finally, I moved on for a short period of time to using gabapentin and phenibut once or twice a week. Surprise, surprise; I paid the price every time. Even if I used in moderation, it made PAWS worse or I’d find myself dealing with some fatigue, depression or even RLS (one of my final, unfortunate lingering symptoms) days afterwards. Using other substances didn’t allow my neurochemistry to recalibrate and simply continued the endless cycle of craving a high and trying to climb back from an abysmally low baseline. It may be a different substance, but it sure as hell became the same fucked up story, a story that needed to end.

3. Don’t overthink it; be patient - I see a lot of good advice in this sub. Eat healthy! Exercise! Take up hobbies to take your mind off withdrawals or PAWS! I tried all these things early on in my quit. They did help, but I still felt like hell months after quitting. I suppose this might be more for long-term, heavy users, but it does get better. I was like you thinking that I’d never be like some of the posters who were writing about life after long term abstinence and how good they felt. You can get there – time is what it takes. While diet and exercise play a part, you still may struggle with fatigue or lack of motivation. Keep going! Don’t frustrate yourself thinking you’ve checked all the boxes off your recovery list and still aren’t feeling 100%. Being frustrated about trying everything and still feeling PAWS can possibly lead to relapse. I know it’s tough, but do what you can to relax and wait it out. 

4. Moderation after addiction is a joke - When I quit the first time in 2016, it only took a few weeks for me to consider using kratom again, but this time in moderation. For a whole year, I treated myself to kratom on Friday and Sunday evenings only. Prior to my 2016 quit, I no longer felt the high with daily usage. However, that opiated feeling I had missed for so long came back again after having abstained for those short-lived few weeks. How unfortunate for me that was looking back. I lived for those Friday’s and Sunday’s. Even using it sparingly, I eventually upped my dose on those days. As I continued to do that, my baseline during the week slowly decreased. It began to get tougher and tougher to get through the days when I wasn’t taking kratom. Then I gave in and started using it on Tuesdays. I was up to 3 days a week. It took a few months after that and I gradually climbed up to 4 and then 5 days a week. I desperately tried to hold by drinking or taking other non-opioid drugs in order to prevent full physical dependency. I could stand it, caved finally, and used it everyday once again to reclaim my “sanity.” Looking back, moderation was probably worse than everyday usage where I was fighting off interdose withdrawals. I lived only for those days where I took kratom and planned certain events on those days. It was not living. I was still addicted, but this time, I was forever fighting off the desire to get high the majority of the time until my next dose I had Sharpied in red on my calendar. You can decide to hold out for awhile and keep up that moderation schedule, but it will catch up with you eventually if you abused this drug in the past. Not to mention: it’s an EXHAUSTING way to live your life! 

5. Reassessing your relationships - This won’t apply to everyone. It did for me though. As I took steps to clean up my act and eventually develop healthier habits, I looked around at my friends and some of my family and realized many of them were either addicts or struggling with addictive tendencies. While I always knew this, I was so focused on myself that I didn’t think too much about other people’s influences on my life. When I stopped taking kratom, I had to learn how to live life again. I couldn’t just turn to a substance any longer to be happy, cure boredom, or foster complacency when there were real issues or accomplishments around me that I needed to tackle. I loved my boyfriend of 9 years, but his addiction to marijuana and alcohol showed no signs of stopping. Not only was it difficult for me to stay clean living with someone who continued to indulge, but there was really no one there to keep me in check or root for my recovery. There was no one there to take those steps and find things to do like exercise, eat healthily, or dive into hobbies. I was only met with someone who was fine with letting life pass by, missing opportunities, and not taking advantage of life’s choices and experiences. Throughout the first year of my kratom quit, I binge drank with him and continued to associate with his drug-addled friends. Making the decision to end my relationship with him was like making the choice to euthanize a sick pet. I loved him, but I knew deep down what I had to do. Thoughts pervaded my mind like, “maybe he’ll get sober and we can work together to live happily ever after.” Or, “maybe I can power through, get past my cravings, and everything will be ok on my end even if he’s using.” I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t live with someone who was out of touch with the real world like I had been for so long and who didn’t care about the future as long as the feel-good chemicals kept on coming. So after being a year kratom free and struggling with transferring my addiction to alcohol or other drugs, I finally had to end the relationship. After that, it felt as if a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders and it was easier for me to take those steps to living without substances. If you’re in the same situation with a close friend or significant other, it may be time to reassess that relationship. You might not shut them out forever, but you may need time to focus on yourself and revisit that relationship later to see if things will truly work out in the end. Relationships are important; but so are you and your sobriety. 

6. You won’t always get off so easy the next time you quit - this one is very important for those of you who think some of the horror stories here are exaggerated or are dabbling again in periodic usage. I really do think kratom, like many other drugs, has a kindling effect. In my experience, stopping wasn’t too tough early on. About a year in, I felt generally out of it and tired when I stopped. Later, I would feel depressed and had issues with sleep. When I got to my quit in 2016, I had 3-4 days of restlessness, irritability, fatigue, lack of appetite, and insomnia. It wasn’t enough for me to put kratom in my rear view. After nearly 2 years of moderation after my 2016 quit, I eventually ended up becoming a daily user again. I stopped to take a tolerance break. The withdrawals this time were vicious. Severe fatigue, insomnia, panic, and existential depression. My Brain fog was so bad I almost felt as though I had taken an entirely different drug that made me feel like my head was clouded, lobotomized, and submerged underwater. It was bad that first week, and I continued almost immediately right into PAWS. For those of you who haven’t experienced it and are on the fence about its existence, PAWS is real. I didn’t know what it was until coming to this sub a few weeks after my quit. At that time, I found out what I was dealing with. If you fuck around with this plant long enough, I do believe you will pay the price eventually with a long recovery. I always thought it was a few days of discomfort. Then I accepted it was a week of shitty, sleepless, restless nights. I had no idea I was in for 8-9 months before I was truly out of the woods with this last quit. Be warned. Before you decide to scratch that itch just one last time or try out moderation, at least take the time to consider what may lie ahead if you don’t stop now. Maybe the last product I used was laced. Maybe it’s simply kindling. In the end it doesn’t matter. Kratom is inconsistent and you don’t know really what you’re getting. The next time getting off the K train could be the hell you haven’t yet experienced that so many here before you have perfectly described.

7. A life without kratom isn’t as scary or difficult as you might think - I was there for so long: “Kratom makes me feel good. It boosts my energy. It makes boring, tiresome activities so much better!” When it stopped working the way I wanted it to: “I can barely drag my ass out of bed each morning. I hate the come-Downs with depression, physical aches, anxiety. I hate the nausea and wobbles when I take too much. I hate the worry I feel when my stash gets low and I feverishly place an order online or head over to the nearest smoke shop.” For me at least, the negatives kept increasing and the positives kept dwindling. When you quit, you not only ditch those negatives, you begin to taste what it’s like to be free. No more constant thoughts about dosing. No more starving yourself to feel high. No more assessing whether you took too much or too little 30 minutes after dosing. After I quit, how I felt was similar to being out of shape and working out at the gym – I got better and better at living my life without kratom, and later without other substances, like working out a muscle. My stamina to cope with sobriety continued to increase. After a while, getting high becomes less and less of a priority and your thoughts will naturally begin wandering their way towards your interests, goals, and socializing with others. It does TAKE TIME! That’s important to remember. I was so worried I’d forever be craving or thinking about kratom. As time goes on, your brain gives up on the sludge and begins to look for other ways to feel pleasure or get dopamine. Think of healthy habits or activities you may have enjoyed in the past. And remember, don’t get frustrated if they don’t come back right away. If you used for years like I did, you’ll still have cruddy days here and there for awhile. Keep going!

Like I said, these are some things I learned along the way which helped me. You, no doubt, will have things that influence you to quit and stay quit. You can taper or cold turkey, but in the end it’s about taking time and relying on patience to rediscover your mind and body and build yourself up from there. This plant numbs you out so much, that quitting really can feel like waking up and getting in touch with reality again. 

Major congrats to all who are in the quitting process or those of you who are getting ready to make the leap!!!! The pain and all the crap you have to trudge through to get there will be both a boost to your ego and a means to achieving a calmer, more collected, happier life.",121

After failing at tapering for over a year, I'm thankful that I was able to finally do so and jump from 3gpd after using 20-30gpd for over 3 years.

I'm thankful kratom didn't have a hold on me longer than it did.

I'm thankful that I haven't gotten a real strong mental obsession (what most people here call ""craving"") since I've quit.

I'm thankful when the *thought* to use again has entered my mind, that I've been quickly able to recognize it as a LIE, replace it with the TRUTH, not act upon the lie and move on to something productive.

Although I'm in pain daily, I'm thankful my back pain is nowhere as debilitating and painful as it was during my last year-and-a-half of kratom addiction.

I'm thankful I can exercise, after years of not wanting to, not caring, and then being physically unable to once I got the motivation to do so.

I'm thankful for Wim Hof and his discoveries and teachings of Wim Hof Method breathing, cold showers and cold exposure.

I'm thankful I haven't been physically ill since quitting kratom and going through acute withdrawals.

I'm thankful for this Quitting Kratom subreddit and the people here who've shown me the way.

I'm thankful that this sub is here to help others quit kratom and lend support in doing so.

I'm thankful I no longer have to worry about and deal with the health issues and side effects of kratom (Those daily hot flashes always come to mind when I think of this as well as so many other things).

I'm thankful I no longer have to plan my life around using kratom.

I'm thankful I didn't commit suicide when I thought about doing so every day of the last couple months of my addiction.

I'm thankful that I'm able to work on and attempt to rebuild relationships.

I'm thankful I'm able to work on and rebuild myself.

I'm thankful my body and brain have and continue to heal.

I'm thankful I'm no longer a sedentary zombified green blob who would watch the clock constantly for my next fix.

I'm thankful it ""stopped working"" for me, as it eventually put me into a position of having no choice but to quit.

I'm thankful I was able to QUIT and have been able to STAY QUIT!


I think 20 is enough for now. I'm sure there are many, many more.",22

Whatever you are going thru.. it will end and new life waiting for you. Kratom is my experience of life. Now I know very light and also very dark side of life and I growing, I pushing up my life, because everything will be better if you practice, exploring and search for reasons..

Kratom teach me lot of about my body. How serotonine, dopamine, testosterone works. The key is in hormonal balance of body. If you break rules and break hormonal balance, it can be big impact to your body (easiest part) and you mind (hardest part). Healing of balance it takes lot of time sometime.

That might not sound like a lot but I'm tiny and very sensitive. I started when I was 26. I really thought I would feel better around the two week mark. But I feel fucked. I sleep 9 hours a night (I try to tear myself out of bed after the 8 hour mark for fear of oversleeping but lately I've just let myself sleep) and wake up, not rested at all. It almost feels like the EXACT same way I felt like on kratom. That ""hangover feeling"", horrible brain fog and tiredness all day that can only be relieved by dosing. Basically I'm getting that but I'm never getting the relief at the end of the day, which seems like a cruel joke. I've also started breaking out like crazy which is rough considering the condition of my skin + hair were two of the biggest reasons i decided to quit. 

I'm also having the most insane blood sugar swings. I constantly feel like I'm about to crash and need to snack even though I've been objectively eating healthier than ever. I used to intermittent fast 16:8 so this is a real burn, considering I now wake up with my blood sugar already in the toilet and starving.

I spend hours on this sub and it seems like things start turning around day 12 or so. After the acutes were over on day 4 or 5 I was so elated, I thought I'd made it through the worst. But this tiredness, grogginess, and general out-of-whackness feels worse.

I'm on a boatload of adaptogens and general supplement protocol because it seems like a lot of these issues are hormone related. They're all gentle though, so I can't see them making me feel like this... but they don't seem to be really helping either.

Well I came across a song I haven’t listened to in years called Nobody Rides For Free by Ratt. And holy shit this song put drug addiction in perspective for me like no other song has. It’s a kick ass song and it makes me feel like it’s a song about overcoming addiction. (At least that’s how I personally interpret it). The title of the song is as true as it gets. Nobody rides for free we always have to pay a price to ride that opioid roller coaster. Just felt the need to share this because it was an eye opener for me and it just instilled in me that there’s no loop hold when it comes to addiction. If you ride the ride you WILL pay for it. I’m 28 btw so I don’t expect many people my age to listen to this type of music but i was raised on it.

Stocked the fridge / cupboard yesterday. I detailed the inside of my car two days ago too, as I tend to make a mess of my car in active addiction.  Felt really good to come back into a clean space with zero reminders that I used K here.  


Physically and emotionally I feel about 97% back to baseline.  Still mild bouts of anxiety and some milder issues with my gut.  Sleep quality isn't wonderful either, but I've never slept very well so I don't blame the K for that at this point.  I've been attending NA meetings, and am active in my sponsorship family, that's been a wonderful support.  This board has provided much the same kind of support for me.  Huge thanks to everyone here.  I've been exercising every day in some capacity, and have weekly therapy appointments.  I make time for all of this around my duties as a full time graduate student.  My sponsorship family keeps reminding me to be thankful for everything that I have, and not to focus on have-nots.  That said, I am so thankful to be clean today, and that life is generally OK.  God willing, I will check in here with a month in a few days.  If I can get off this crap, absolutely anyone can.  We can do this.",12

This was largely in part to help me quit drinking,which it did very successfully. I was dosing everyday 6-10 grams. This last Sunday I didn't dose for work reasons. I had mild headaches all day but that night was terrible! I had RLS symptoms accompanied with insomnia. Fast forward to today and no headaches or any other physical problems but I'm still having RLS and insomnia just at night obviously. I've tried hot baths , magnesium and melatonin which maybe helps a little but this still blows! How long is this going to last? 
Do people take like Z quill or anything to get through this ? 
The RLS might be subsiding a little but the insomnia is still severe. 
Thanks in advance!",2
2020-11-25 07:17:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/k0r5og/need_reassurance/,Need reassurance,"I am 21 days after CT. I am experiencing paws. I already have underlying depression and anxiety which I take medication for both. But the paws seems to be exacerbating my depression symptoms.

I feel I can't get out of my bed. I can't get it together to clean my house for Thanksgiving. I don't even feel like getting up to pee. 

I want to take some. Just a little for today and tomorrow. At the same time, I don't want to take any. I would feel so defeated. I have people counting on me and I just hope they understand when I don't really have the energy to entertain them... Of course they don't have a clue what I'm dealing with. 

I'm not out the woods yet. But I am trying to remember ALL the reasons I quit. The withdrawals, the exhaustion when I didn't take it or get enough of it, the back pain that lingers still, the amount of work I missed when I quit, the scattered person I became after a few weeks usage. 

If you have an encouraging word or advice, I deeply appreciate it. Here's to another day and God Bless!",1
2020-11-25 07:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/k0r0zm/trying_to_quit/,Trying to Quit,"Hey all, 

I just found this subreddit and wanted to throw my experiences out here to see if they resonate with others. It might be long winded, but I want to give some backstory. 

I found Kratom somewhere around 2010 because I had lower back pain and they were cracking down on opiates in my state. I had trouble getting pain management because I was in my early 20's and supposedly too young to have back pain...I have bounced around on and off Kratom since then with the periods in between filled with scripts for Tramadol (found a Dr. who believed me). Well for the last 2 and half years I have been back on it daily because I moved away from that doc and now if you want opiates you better have cancer or half a limb. I am not exactly sure how many grams I take a day now, but after reading some of you were taking 30+ mg a day I thought I would give you an idea. 

As a side note I take Metoprolol for ""High"" blood pressure (it hovers at 130/100) which they say is high. I also take Duloxetine for anxiety daily and as an emergency 0.5 mg of Xanax as needed. I also take Ambien for sleep daily.

When I started I was taking a tablespoon of powder and mixing it in with a big glass of chocolate milk and slowly drinking it, I would reup with a teaspoon here and there throughout the day. I then moved on to 5 of the little gel capsule pills (.675 mg) and then bumping that dose with 1 or 2 for the rest of the day. At max I would estimate taking 20 pills a day and I did that for a while until I weighed the prices of the pills vs. powder. At some point we got to what I do now daily. I wake up and take 2 teaspoons, put some water in my mouth and dump and chug. I would say around 3-4 hours later I will take another 1 teaspoon and so on until I go to sleep. If online estimates are true I am taking almost a gram per teaspoon. If that is right for the last 2 and half years I have been taking on average 5-10 grams a day. My main reason I think I never got to the levels I have seen on here is the amount of anxiety I get if I take too much in a day. I hit a limit usually and once I feel my anxiety I stop for the day.

Now comes the reason I am quitting. I have been having odd ailments throughout the years that I have always contributed to bad genes or just getting older. The first one I really noticed was having diarrhea for weeks on end to the point I got hemorrhoids. I always attributed that to drinking on weekends, and it may have been since it has stopped since I stopped drinking (for the most part). Another symptom that has started over the last 2 years are these hot flashes that I get whenever I am outside in anything above 75 degrees. I will get so hot and will not sweat and then start to feel like I am blacking out. It goes away once I cool down, but can be scary. I am not sure if this is Kratom, or the meds I take. This has only happened a handful of times (I mostly stay indoors, especially now), so it hasn't been a huge issue, but does stop me from exercising. Lastly, the main issue I have been having, skin issues galore. It started with little blister like pustules on my fingers that would come and go so infrequently that I didn't care or noticed. It has now morphed into my hands are red, cracked, and sometimes bleeding most of the time. My arms are ashy as hell (I have sleeves tattooed and they look faded or off white until I put some lotion on). My face flakes at times, my hair has gotten greasy and thinner (might be age) and my legs and feet have sores/scales. 

I haven't gone to an allergist in the past year (I have gone in the past and wasn't allergic to the basics) or dermatologist because the pandemic and it is an issue that comes and goes. I have tried things like lotions and taking cold/less showers, but nothing has helped. It has also been steadily getting worse where I have days where my eyes itch or nose is stuffed and I cant breathe at 100%. The only other problem I have had is sleeping a ton, but that might just be me.

Starting yesterday I have cut Kratom out and threw it into the trash (had half a kilo left) and hopefully my skin will clear up and allergy symptoms will go away. I just worry one day I will go into anaphylactic shock, so think it is time to move on. I am doing this as a test to see if my body heals, but if it doesn't I might just go back to taking the same or less dosage for the pain until I find better options and go find out what else could be causing the skin issues.

If anyone has had similar experiences let me know, could use some stories to keep me away from Kratom (which I still see as beneficial for my pain, but maybe not my long term health). I also would love to hear what I can do to help my back pain, has CBD helped anyone or has anyone tried some of the sister plants to Kratom?",3

I just took 2.7 grams. 

I am scared I ruined all my progress. I don’t feel like I will continue to relapse after this but I am going to be so bummed if this is back to square one. 

How bad will this reset with my withdrawals?

Am I back to square one?

I don’t even enjoy this much. If anything relapsing is just proving to me that I wanna quit. 

Also, thanks to everyone here. Finding this sub-reddit is so insanely helpful and I can’t believe there is such a great place to help people quit.

Anyways, I am just tired of my stupid life of chaos and being up and down. Hanging around people who suck and have no good intentions for anyone but themselves. Or maybe not even themselves.

50-70 GPD for 2-3 years (who knows) CT and I thought this shit would follow me forever. I knew it had to come to an end.

I’m fortunate not to suffer from depression and anxiety but for those of you who do push through. 

For those of you thinking of quitting make the plunge continue to tell yourself you can. Take unisom to try and sleep the first couple of days. For me the first 2 days was the hardest. Start hating yourself for starting it and you’ll love yourself for quitting. Drink water and exercise. The first 2 days survive and I promise it gets easier.

Today, I have already taken what I normally take in a full day and it’s only 1:30.    

Nobody around me knows, nor do I feel like it would be appropriate to tell anybody.   With past addictions my family is tired of it.   My girlfriend is amazing, but if I tell her this I feel like I will be a huge failure to her, cause so much stress and worry in her already stressful life.

I was using about 20-40 GPD for 2 years but cut it down to about 12-18 for the last year or so . 

Decided enough was enough 3 weeks ago. Took about 1-2 grams for a couple of days before jumping . 

The first week , actually by day 4 even , was much much easier than I was anticipating. Outside of sleep , I was motivated and exercising and staving off anxiety/depression . Emotions fluctuated and i could cry at the drop of a hat , but that eventually faded and my moods stabilized. Day 19 however I felt like I got hit with some extra hard lethargy , and anxiety. It’s weird how non linear the recovery can be . I read about it a lot but wasn’t sure I believed it . Well now I do lol . Anyway , it’s not all that bad . At the end of the day you feel that spark in yourself that you used to feel before the use. Makes me feel younger. The biggest key is to just stay occupied which can be tough during covid. Another huge help for me to quit was to tell somebody. If you don’t want it getting out there then just tell someone who you know you can trust to keep it to themselves.

Anyway , happy Tuesday y’all and have a great holiday. If you’re thinking of quitting just know it’s possible and it’s never as bad as you think. The tricky thing with kratom was always feeling like it wasn’t that serious of a vice. Clearly we were all wrong about that .

Still dealing with acutes somewhat and now I’m feeling the depression and uninterested in anything. I absolutely hate this part. I sigh so much and just get so down that idk what to do. I’m not going back ever. I know this will pass but when it hits it seems so much harder to get through the day. I have to keep telling myself that I can get through today. But it’s hard man is it hard. But I guess when it first comes on is when it will be at its worst. So logically if I can get through the worst part of paws then I can get through the rest that may come. I just had to get this out otherwise i would’ve made it worse on myself. Thanks guys let’s hope tomorrow will be better psychologically. And hopefully I’ll be completely done with acutes soon too.,9

I made the horrible mistake taking some phenibut after quitting ( not much only 2 times a week) and I also took adderall one single time. Now its weeks after that and I feel very weird.

I think I experience brain fog, but I am not sure its a mild dissociating feeling almost. Its not bad and I dont have any anxiety, its just a weird spaced out feeling. Like I said probably brain fog, but I am not sure. The next thing is I probably experience tinnitus. When I go for a walk, I hear a clicking in my head. I also sometimes feel a pressure in the head. I remember a few days ago I smoked some weed and I got a strong pressure feeling in the head and it also didnt even really feel like weed.

I sleep fine and besides mood swings, I am also not really depressed tbh, but I dont feel normal. My liver kidney and blood are all good, and I dont lack any minerals, but theres definitly something wrong with my head.

Also after taking the adderall (months ago), I still need to move my jaw sometimes and I also feel a mild pressure  in my jaw sometimes.

So to summarize I probably fucked my brain up.

I will probably do  nuclear spin tomography to see what is happening, but I am wondering just wtf is happening ?? Does anyone have any idea ?",6

The first 3 years I accomplished quite a bit. Started another business. Learned accounting program and got really lean and fit. Helped me through a broken leg. 6 months on crutches and a hip replacement without hardly any opioids. It really turned on me after year 3. Dosing or withdraw all the time. Massive insomnia and digestive issues. That’s when I tried to quit and found out how really addicted I had become. I finally got a real quit in 2 years ago but cracked at 144 days. Used miserably with repeated failed attempts to quit. Finally got another 80 days and cracked again. I finally gave up quitting and just decided I would dose until I couldn’t do it anymore. That day came 5-24-20! The green monster took me for a ride that I’ll never forget. I discovered this sub just a few days into this quit. It has been a difference maker.

I've always drank plenty of water but was extremely sedentary. I'm not diabetic. And I haven't had this problem since I quit. I believe the issue went away fairly quickly after quitting, if not during the tail end of my taper. Unfortunately, I can't remember precisely. Some things are a little foggy from that time period.

I just wanted to throw that out there because I can't remember ever seeing that mentioned here and that particular issue doesn't come up in searches. It could have been from the kratom. Or it could have been from being terribly sedentary for 3 years, poor diet and no exercise. So even if the issue wasn't directly related to kratom use, it's still kinda' indirectly related... since I was a do-nothing bloated couch frog for years while using kratom.

Bottom line: I quit kratom and now my cankles and purple toes are no more. Yet ANOTHER benefit of quitting. Quit and Stay Quit!",8

I feel myself with my flaws and quality.  I was taking the products to help me overcome my difficulties but recently my car broke down and I was much more serene with a clear mind than with Kratom ... I got through this ordeal without feeling overwhelmed and  I'm proud of myself .... like what this green mud really serves as a pretext to shoot myself and do my daily life ... one thing that helps me a lot: reading at night.

But for the last week, I've also just felt kinda... numb, foggy, almost like when I was using.  I'm finding it difficult to focus, and I feel like I'm in a daydream for most of the day.

The first 1-2 weeks after I quit I felt so raw and alive, even though in many ways it sucked.  I feel like I want to get back to that state, but without all the horrible physical symptoms.  Like, I kinda miss acutes?  At times it felt almost spiritual or transcendental.  I'm obviously not going to use again just to quit to try to get that feeling back, but I kind of want to know if anyone else has felt this way.

I'm hopeful that the numbness is just PAWS and I will start feeling more ""alive"" again eventually, but I'd love to hear from anyone who has been quit for a while and experienced something similar in the first month or so.  When did the numbness/anhedonia/brain fog go away for you, if ever?",3

B1, Zinc, D3, K2, and others seem to have helped me gain some energy and better sleep.

Make sure it's all in safe (smallish) amounts and that you don't take them too long.

Also, I'm going to get an iodine test tomorrow because I heard Kratom can take iodine levels.

Also I'm going to add in A, E, and a bit of Calcium in a couple days once they arrive from Amazon.

Kratom seems to have made my Iron level HIGH, however. Also my cholesterol is now high.

**There is a TL;DR at the end 


So this is embarrassing and I feel safe talking about it here. I love life, God and the people in my life. I couldn't ask for anything more. I had bad alcohol and drug problems in the past... I have been off all of that for 5 years. I just am a fan of cbd and hemp products like cbg flower/cbd flower etc. But I got curious about kratom and here i am about a month in. I believe I am approaching the 30 day mark very soon. I have an addictive nature so .... well, I started with extract off the rip...  I'm up to 2 extracts give or take a day. If I want to feel great I will take a 3rd dose late in the day. I have seen, or read here, it won't be all that bad to jump now. I have a huge responsibility at work and can't just CT while at work. I have an opportunity to jump over Thanksgiving before I dig myself in a hole. I have about 5 days off to get over this and not look back. It was fun at first but its stealing my money and my personality and I am relying more on kratom then my higher power to be useful. 



I would like to report my experience here and maybe get some motivation from you wonderful people.

Anyways yesterday during the day wasn’t so bad, but last night is when it all hit me. I didnt sleep at all. Just serious anxiety and RSL. Man that RSL is no joke..

I searched “day 10” in this sub and found some relevant experiences. For me, I was at about 3 shots a day before this last CT. Today, day 10, is my first day back at work: I was in Aruba for my CT and the only symptoms I experienced was diarrhea, nausea, being tired and not wanting to do anything. I was on vacation though so I can’t even complain. I did it on purpose this way, because whether it was on the beach or at home, I needed to take time off to finally quit. Even though I believe staying busy is helpful. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share this. I’ve had worse withdrawals when I was up to 6 shots a day. Quit for 5 days, then started again, you guys know the sick cycle. 

I’m just sitting here, with a shit ton of work to do after vacation, and it’s so strange that it’s like I don’t even **care** to do any of it. I mean, I know staying busy will help, but why the f*ck am I being so stubborn. I just don’t want to do anything. I was just on vacation FFS. I went to the vape shop to get a vape, and the lady went to reach for the MIT but I told her nope - at least that was a really good moment today.

I quit a few months in when my rx ran out early and I got sick without the medication. 
Years later, while twitching around in a hard seat during a conference,  young man next to me asked me if I was ok. I told him about my back and he offered me this “harmless” green powder called Kratom. That was 2015. 
I have been Kratom off and on to deal with agonizing back pain. Lately, it’s been more on. I use 5 teaspoons a dose twice or three times a day in toss and wash. Recently, without the third dose I get tired and my nose runs. 
I started a full time job two weeks ago and even with the kratom, I suffer. I need the aid of a cane in the morning until my body warms up. 
I do not have medical insurance. 

I know I am addicted, physically and mentally, to Kratom. 
I bought some 00 gelatin capsules and a little pill making set up and am going to make my own capsules in an effort to slowly lower my dose. 
I do not have a pain management plan in the meantime. And I have to show up for work, which is 100% on my feet.

Mostly because I struggle to use it in moderation, I always feel the need to take it to the extreme (history of addiction in my family & I myself have addict tendencies).

And I've never had an issue with it, I've been able to go without it for a couple days, I think because I would be at home or I because I do take lexapro, so it made my anxiety manageable at least.

But now I think I might be pregnant. I took one test and it said negative, but I'm still 2 weeks late on my period. I'm going to take another test tomorrow. 
So my question is this - anyone on here quit while pregnant? I've had 2 miscarriages, 1 because of my anxiety and quitting everything at once, and one when I was younger because of my pcos.
Obviously I'll talk to a doctor, but how did any of you quit without putting so much pressure and anxiety on yourself and the fetus?

I am 24 hours in and don't feel too bad, the RLS is still always present, but compared to the few days I was tapering it hasn't increased too much. I was able to get a few hours sleep with minimal interruptions. I am expecting things to ramp up today/tonight, but I am done, I have made up my mind.

I don't want to tell anyone in my family about this, but I do think some accountability will be helpful for keeping on track, that's why I wanted to post formally on here that I have quit. 

Best of luck to anyone else in the middle of their quit, starting out, or tapering.",19

Been a daily user for about 4 years and Kratom has completely taken over my life. I need advice.,"I am a 24 year old male who has been taking Kratom every day for about 4 years. My dose has increased substantially in those 4 years, going from just a few grams a day to around 8-10 grams 3 times a day. My hair is falling out, I'm depressed, anxious, I can't sleep, my skin has gone pale, dark bags under my eyes, etc. I look like a miserable drug addict and thats what I am. I have made serious sacrifices to my dreams and aspirations for kratom. I prioritize my ""kratom time"" over everything else. I'll skip meals so that I can cling on to what little ""high"" I can still get from kratom. Kratom has been a major factor in the death of my last two relationships. I've tried stopping but can never stick to it. I hate myself, and those are all the reasons why. If I want to not just continue living but prosper at all, then I need to quit. I just feel such an intense need for it, especially when I'm at work. I hate my job and kratom just makes the day so much more bearable. I honestly can't imagine not having kratom just for that reason. But I have to stop, I NEED to stop. I can't keep living this way. My only aspirations in life are to start a family that I can fully support and take care of. But I am failing at achieving that due to my rampant kratom usage. I know crying to random people on the internet won't save me, I just don't know what else to do and I feel hopeless.

Edit: I can't express enough how thankful I am for all the support. I honestly had no idea such a large support group even existed. Feeling like I was alone was the main thing that caused me to relapse when I tried quitting in the past. I am just amazed by this subreddit, you guys are so legitimately supportive and because of that I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I WILL quit kratom and take my life back from that horrid swamp water. And I will post regularly about it and certainly keep in touch with this amazing community.

2020-11-21 17:26:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jyjxyy/day_33_staying_strong/,Day 33. Staying strong.,"Hello crew. Hoping everyone is doing well and staying on course with your quits/ tapers. 

Just wanted to check in and give you all a quick update as I’ve stayed fairly quiet recently. Although I’m reading daily, I’ve tapered off with the daily posts.

Still experiencing inconsistent ups and downs. I can’t say the good days string together in length quite yet. But.. they are peppered within there! These days give me such hope, especially within the stretches of grey, gloomy, blah days. 

I find that this time around, cravings have been pretty much non-existent. Although dealing with a ton of mental turmoil and lack of motivation/ focus. There hasn’t been any overwhelming urge to put this stuff in my body. The thought may casually cross the mind, but it quickly disappears just as it had entered. 

I can’t quite put my finger on this as in past quits, relapse inevitably occurred when the cravings came on strong. I may very well have hit such a low point in life that the thought of continuing is just repulsive. Regardless, trying to keep the guard up and stay aware of where I went wrong in the past. It’s when I started feeling really good that things reverted back to the old ways. Keep this in mind when you start to feel that wonderful break in your quits. When you start to feel like your old self is that danger zone.

Happy weekend to each of you out there. Grit those teeth and push forward with all your might. Just you wait till the fleeting positive moments shower you with love and light. It’s so fucking worth it!! ❤️",10
2020-11-21 17:04:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jyjkej/3_days/,3 days,It’s been over 72 hrs CT quitting kratom and it’s been rough but seemingly getting better each day. It’s the night time rls I can’t stand but it’s nothing new to me because I’ve abused opiates in general for over a decade and last time getting off of opiates two years ago I used kratom to get through it. Needless to say I’ve been under kratoms grip ever since finally breaking free but it’s especially hard when people close to me are still using it in our home together.,5
2020-11-21 16:59:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jyjhj0/33_days_off_kratom/,33 Days Off Kratom,"Although I only used for 10 months, I felt trapped. Tried quitting two prior times and didn't last 24 hours either time. I thought I would be waiting around the clock for my doses everyday for the rest of my life. Addiction runs in my family and my drug of choice was always alcohol. I haven't drank in two years and seven months now. That's one good thing kratom did for me, helped me not go back to drinking... because if I'm being honest, in the beginning of the pandemic, if I didn't have Kratom, I might have resorted to drinking. So for that, I am thankful. But... If I would have known the severe consequences and just how addicting it is, I would have never touched the stuff! It's great until it turns it's back on you and it will, it's only a matter of when.

By the end, I wasn't measuring, instead I was heaping spoon after spoon after spoon into a water bottle, drinking globs of powder I would put so much, fill the bottle up again and again, to get every last drop out. Grosses me out just thinking about it.  There were times I would almost throw up while drinking it because of how thick it was. 

October 19th, the last day I took kratom, I cant even tell you how much I took, probably enough to kill me. It wouldn't work, so I kept taking more. I had my doses down to a specific time everyday (8 am, 1 pm, 5 pm, and if I was off work the next day I would take a dose around 8pm.) This day was different, I was dosing every 30 mins trying to get my usual high, it never came. Instead I just felt aggravated, on edge, and flat out gross. I was pissed it wasn't working. Looking back, I am so thankful. I'm not sure if it was a bad two batches (I bought two Kilos and tried both) or if my body was just rejecting it because it had enough. But either way, whatever it was, was exactly what I needed to get off. Not to mention the hair loss I've suffered. 

Here I am, 33 days later, not looking at this thread the majority of my day for hope, advice, and strength. Not waking up in the morning and pre-mixing bottles to carry in my purse for my doses. Not waking up with WDs every morning until dose. Not having paranoia that someone thinks I'm high or will find my stash. Not spending every waking moment thinking about kratom and when I can drink my next bottle. HOLY SHIT YALL, I'M FREEEEEEEEEEEEE!

Acutes fucking sucked. Two weeks of hell. I couldn't take time off work, showed up everyday and looked forward to clocking out. Who knew time could go on for so long? Kratom always made my work day go by fast, so going through acutes at work and the clock going twice as slow was a double hell, but I embraced the suck. I was taking all the recommended supplements, teas, working out, etc. I'm not sure if they helped or not, because I still felt like absolute shit, no energy, apathy, angry, just felt like fuck life all together- but who knows what I would have felt like if I had not taken anything. I think acutes are shitty no matter what you do, just have to fight through them and not give in. I kept telling myself after each day of hell, ""I got through that day, I don't want to go though it again, keep going.""

I think it was day 19 that I woke up and actually felt good, physically and mentally. I couldn't even believe it. I thought it was the ""pink cloud."" Maybe it was, because I've had mentally shitty days here and there since then. But I read a comment on here a while back and it went something like, ""I think we forget that people have bad days because we're used to turning to kratom anytime we dont feel good and it 'fixes' everything"" That really has kept me going, I think about it anytime I'm not in a good mood. Like holy shit, I'm human again. 

It gets better yall. I know the timeline is different for everyone physically and mentally, but each day you don't put that shit in your body you are more and more thankful. 

Sorry for the long post, but I just wanted to give and give back to each and every person on this sub. If it wasn't for this sub, I wouldn't be 33 days clean. I appreciate every post, every comment, and every person on here. I owe yall. Thank you so very much for everything. I hope this post helps someone else make the jump or continue their journey. 

Much love, 

Michelle.",11

Freedom feels better than its ever felt before. I am exhausted, going to work sucks, but I am FREE. I’ve tried and failed to quit many times because the cravings eventually wear me down, but I can’t say I’ve had an honest craving since I quit. Kratom is the worst. You feel good for 30 minutes after taking it, and then the next few hours are about counting down the time until you can take it again. The price for this daily cycle is heavy...exhaustion, no emotions, sickly appearance, withdrawals, etc. Who wants to live like that? Unfortunately, I did, for years. 

You know when it’s time to quit, and hopefully, if you’re on here reading this, the time is now. Despite my lack of motivation and apathy, I feel so much better mentally than I ever did on kratom. Instead of knowing I need to quit and dreading the future discomfort, I am now looking forward to getting my energy back, being me again, and facing the good and bad in my life clearheaded. It can only go up from here. 

Two weeks of discomfort is a small price to pay for being in control of your life again. For those of you who are tapering or even thinking about quitting, if you can get past the first two weeks and keep looking forward instead of back, you will be in a much better place than you are today.",21

I was diagnosed with RLS before I started Kratom and have been on medication (Mirapex) for it for years now so maybe that has something to do with it?

Reduced to 28 per month last month 56 grams a month. I believe i made progress lowering my tolerance the past 2 months. 

I just don't want to deal with having panic attacks and mood swings when I go out for a week especially gerd symptoms from withdrawal and always feel to relieve bowels.

Bottom line kratom is as addicting as alcohol and cigarettes but withdrawal if used everyday feels like moderate opioid withdrawals.

Yesterday was pretty great. Got an unexpected raise at work. Opened some new Magic the Gathering product and did a live stream with my son for the new season of Diablo 3 (I used heavily around my playing video games and streaming).

I’m quitting a super high daily dosage of kratom extracts, today being day 0. I’m going to chronologically document the symptoms I experience as they happen on this thread. My goal here is to: 1) compile a timeline of symptoms for those wanting to know what to expect when quitting, 2) hopefully get some encouragement/inspire others by showing it’s possible and 3) to hold myself accountable to some extent with this supportive community, since no one in my personal life knows about my addiction. 

BACKGROUND- Started using kratom leaf, and over time, built a tolerance. I found extract capsules and loved it (a little too much). Worked up to 5 capsules a day over a period of 6 months. I’ve been on the same dosage for roughly 1 year. Today I found out that it’s a 50:1 extract ratio (blew my fucking mind when I heard that), meaning that theoretically each capsule (0.5 grams) is equal to 25 grams of kratom leaf. I did the math after I heard this information, which would mean I’ve been taking the equivalent of 125 grams of kratom leaf per day. I’ve quit in the past relatively easily, but no where near this daily dosage. It’s time to wash my hands of this stuff. I miss being clear-headed full of energy and really hope I can do this. I don’t like feeling like a slave to a substance. 

Welp, here it goes. Last dose 11/20/2020 @ 8:00pm (4 caps). It’s currently 4:00am 11/21/2020. Still feeling the last dose. Will continue to update with symptoms.

DAY 1: 1:00pm, 11/21/2020
     -Mild headache, no other symptoms. Feeling pretty normal. Will update later

     -7:00pm, feeling fine still. Will update tomorrow.

DAY 2: 8:00am, 11/22/2020
     -I actually woke up this morning feeling great. I normally dose in the morning and at night. I feel like kratom messes with my sleep apnea (opioids in general). Very mild headache, but I haven’t had my coffee yet. Not unusual for me.

     -3:00pm, still feeling physically and mentally fine. I am starting to get an urge to take some, but gonna hold strong. Not difficult yet, hoping it stays that way

     -11:30pm, Kratom started to play a mental game with me today. I didn’t necessarily crave the high, more so today felt like I was missing something. I have some plain leaf, but only plan to take it at a low(er) dosage as needed. For example, I took a 10g dose today. It hit pretty hard considering my tolerance. I’m going to try to go as long as I can between using the plain leaf, but when I do it will be one gram lower (i.e. next dose taken would be 9g). Who knows, it might just turn into a taper. Although I’m upset at myself for taking it today, I view it as a win since the dose I took today is considerably lower than what I was taking. Steps in the right direction. Man the psychological game is hard haha. Gonna try and not take any tomorrow. Until then.

DAY 3: 4:30pm, 11/23/2020
     -Woke up feeling fine. I didn’t get to bed until late and had to wake up early so I’m a little tired. Was busy all day so I didn’t even think about kratom (I don’t take it if I’m going to be around people). Surprisingly I’m home just chilling and have no urge to take it at all. I’m pretty weirded out by that. Anyways, will continue to update.

DAY 4: 6:45am, 11/24/2020
      -going golfing with the boys. Feel completely normal. Seems to be I only crave it when I’m bored and doing nothing.

DAY 5&6:
      -I worked so I forgot to update. I dosed 9g in the evening after golfing on day 4, then like an idiot dosed another 9g a few hours later and played video games. It fucked me up to be honest and I truly didint like it. I was also pissed at myself because I did not take it due to any withdrawal symptoms, purely for pleasure. Anyways, I had work today (25th) and I never take it before work. Had a good day. More social than normal and was more talkative and sharp-witted. I really hate to say it but I haven’t had literally any withdrawal symptoms yet. I think that it’s because I’m doing this thread. It’s really making me take a look at how I’m truly feeling before I make a decision to take any. Also, before quitting I read about how opioids decrease LH and FSH significantly (hormones in the body that produce testosterone). I’m a male, so every day that I don’t take it, in theory, is one day closer to restoring my natural testosterone production (tested naturally at 717 about 10 years ago, not sure what it’s been since). Anyway, advise so far is to write down how you feel before letting yourself dose, it’ll put things in perspective. Like I said, no withdrawal symptoms yet.",63

My wife knows what I’m going through.  I’m sure I have underlying issues that I’m trying to work through, she also admittedly has some mental health issues she is working through, and we both work from home, take care of our 16 month old, and are home pretty much 24/7.  

I guess I expected her to treat me like a fragile baby and coddle me through this quitting process.  Last night, I was watching tv and she was watching something on her phone, and instead of politely asking her to watch somewhere else, I said something that came across as irritable.  And then she responded in fashion, probably saying things in a way she also didn’t mean.  And then I had to make a big deal about it.  Feeling pretty bad about the whole situation this morning.  

Man this is tough.  You’d think being trapped inside with people you love would help the quitting process, but sometimes it seems to make it kind of tougher.

At first I was quite surprised how manageable it was, but the lower I went the more difficult it got. Almost as if the percentage of the drop was more consequential than the flat gram amount. 

Anyhow, I've just slowed down the taper a lot and that has helped. I've dropped to a dose low enough to reliably say it's only effect is placebo (0.1g 5xpd lol, I know). Yesterday i dropped to 3xpd and today haven't had a dose but will take one 0.1 dose before bed then probably no more as long as I can sleep tomorrow night.

My question is about some aching in my knees and feet and ankles in particular that only really started a few days ago.  It's not rls. It feels like I'm an 80 y/o man w/o any cartilage left in my body. I've been wearing shitty shoes at work and had been thinking it was more that than anything but im starting to suspect (and hope!) that it's the lack of K. I bought new running shoes and some insoles for my work boots so we'll see I guess.

Anyone else have this experience? Thanks.",2

2020-11-21 01:01:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jy5tdg/3_days_iodine/,3 days + Iodine,"Hi all,

I think I've dodged a bullet here, I was on 10-15gpd for around 16 months, stopped CT 3 days ago, first night I had some RLS, slept around 4 hours, then managed to get another hour or so later on that day. Second night I had very minor RLS, eventually got to sleep and slept around 6 hour, so an improvement there.

I've just started supplementing iodine (lugols iodine) because I did a patch test and it seemed to show some deficiency, plus I was so tired this past 3 weeks even before stopping kratom, and it seems to have helped with the energy levels, just for anyone who doesn't know, iodine is vital for the thyroid which is the gland which produces hormones which regulate the body's metabolism.

I also take some selenium which is usually recommended when taking iodine.

I read that Japanese people get around 13mg per day of Iodine through their seafood diet (interesting that they also have such low levels of prostate and breast cancer which changes when they adopt a 'western' diet). Now I wouldn't recommend starting on that dose and many people would say it was too high full stop. Iodine can cause a detox reaction especially with bromine so be careful if you start taking, and if you do feel terrible then look up salt loading.

But with many people in here reporting of feeling very low energy, and it being well known that in the Western world many of us are iodine deficient, then this essential nutrient may help people get their engine running a bit smoother.

Have a good day everyone",2
2020-11-20 23:58:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jy508n/hope/,Hope,"Hi friends,
I quit kratom ct a few weeks ago, after using 30 gpd for 6 months, as well as on and off prior to then. The withdrawal symptoms have subsided, apart from very mild RLS if I stay up too late. The worst of the symptoms only persisted for about 5 days after quitting. I did not realize how much kratom use was causing mood swings until being off it for some time. I have also been exercising quite a bit, using an IR sauna and eating fairly clean. I definitely used marijuana for the first while to help with sleep although what helped most with RLS ended up being a nervine tincture containing passiflora and a few other herbs. I just wanted to give y’all hope and let you know how much better I feel without relying on a substance constantly throughout the day. The tough days will pass and you will attain a fulfilling life (albeit full of both good and bad days) without being consumed by thoughts of your next dose or desperately trying to attain a fleeting feeling that often never comes and if it does, does not last. Reach out for support, if needed! You got this!!",3

I try to get off of kratom and I start taking less every 4-5 days. But I reach the point where the lack of the energy boost starts to make it seem impossible to get through the day. And I've repeatedly done this where I give in and take more just to wake up and get moving. I start to feel like I weigh 500 lbs. My arms feel heavy and I can't get my legs moving. And this is the point that I can't get past and where I give in and take more. I think maybe I'm tapering too fast and I need to give my body time to catch up.I  think I'm just really in a hurry to get off kratom so my expectations of how fast I can do it isn't realistic if I am trying to minimize side effects. Are there any supplements that can help replace that energy loss of not having kratom. I  mean, I'm not talking about just drinking a bunch of coffee but maybe something like Tyrosine or whatever.

So I started taking kratom 3 years ago and It was for a reason like many other ppl(quitting opioids) so then I realized I was deep in it and I'm addicted to it, when I decided to quit for the first time I went through 3 weeks of cold turkey and then relapsed after taking pills also to help ease my pills withdrawals but I was just tricking my self to start using smthn else as long as I'm quitting this drug.... Anyway the first tip is to not take any benzos or opioids to help you through the WD, trust me you don't need them its just an easy way out while there is another easy way out but your just thinking it's not easy, quitting with healthy food and natural detox supplements +bunch of water and coffee in the morning can help you too much... (you don't have to drink coffee if you feel like it's gonna affect your sleep), so you quitting without the help of those things can be easy and much better and safer for you to go Sober and i highly recommend it.... So going to the second time, I already went through a hard withdrawal after 3 years, then I started Taking again for 3 months and I decided to quit this time for real, I went cold turkey and I also went to a psychiatrist to help me with it she prescribed me a medication to help with sleep (serqueen 25mg) and adviced me to change my sleeping schedule start exercising and eating healthy anddddd STAYING AWAY FROM PPL WHO TAKE Kratom this is very important, if you have a friend or a relative that takes kratom and you want to stop, you probably won't stop cuz they are effecting the way you think and the power of your will, and this is the big thing that many of us don't realize or apply.... So I'm in week 7 now and I feeeel superrr goooood, I'm happy and healthy (managed to gain 8 KGs and started to look fit a lil bit) I don't feel any PAWS and it's going great cuz i followed this tip, last time I quit I didn't stay away from ppl who do those things (pills kratom and weed) this time I stayed away from those ppl who could affect my quitting, and it was pretty much a killer for the WD you know why(cuz they will try to let you take it once in a while and it will eventually lead to a relapse) so even if you're staying with them PLEASE remember me and say no when they offer you because I swear you will feel stupid and dumb when you relapse after doing great, I swear where you are now whether it's day 1 or day 100 it is better than hitting your shot and feeling good for a lil bit. It is much happier here on this side guys and living sober and clean is much better. I'm not gonna say kratom just fucked me up cuz I admit it made me who I am today and I'm grateful for it, it made me learn a lot of things and understand my self more. But there is a time where you are done and full of a thing and I've taken everything I needed from it and remembered my GOAL of taking it for the first time in life which is (Quitting substances and becoming sober) so guy please stay positive and trust me you'll get through it just stay busy eat healthy and drink plenty of water (it like 80% of curing) and you'll be surprised of how fast you heal, PLEASE don't look at those negative posts cuz everyone is different and Feelings bad and feeling the WD is all about your mindset, if you are gonna depend on those posts and think you're gonna feel shit you are gonna feel shit but trust me if you read this it is easy and it is nothing like they say, it will pass by time.... Change your routine (DON'T DO THE SAME THINGS YOU USED TO DO WHILE IN KRATOM UNLESS IT'S NECESSARY) try waking up in the morning drink 2 cups of water before breakfast it will help with the appetite and then go for a walk anywhere you like (DOING CARDIO HELPS ALOT WITH THE MOOD AND THE RELAXATION) and when you feel tired just take a hot shower (IF YOU CAN DO HOT COLD HOT SHOWER DO IT it helps with the mood it's like showering in hot water and when your about to finish your shower switching to cold for 1 min then switching back to hot if your going to relax or to sleep and Ending it with cold water if you have something to do like work or anything that needs focus or being physical even SEX.... anyways I hope I was helpful guys and if you feel like you need more articles I will do cuz i feel happy helping and it gave me positive vibes as I am trying it for the first time.... Sooooo stay safe yall YOU CAN DO IT if you need to talk to someone about it or need to  need some emotional support and motivation please let me know. Thanks for reading sending vertual hugs and peace❤️❤️❤️❤️",4

I started using Kratom about 3 years ago, the past 2 years has been daily use. At my highest I'd guess around 50 GPD, but most recently around 30 GPD. At the beginning of this week I decided to start quitting, tapering rather than CT. I also had been taking 30-45 mg of Adderall for the past 3 months and stopped taking it at the same time.

This initial week tapering hasn't really been too bad, although RLS has been showing up throughout the day and even worse at night. The RLS and impact on sleep really is the worst part for me, I have gone CT in the past for an international trip and could manage everything else just fine. I have ordered basically every supplement from the wiki, hoping one of them can help with the RLS. Since I am already feeling the RLS I have been debating just going CT and getting it over with sooner. The supplements will come in Monday so I would stop then if so.

**Is there anything else someone could suggest that could help dull the RLS feeling?**

For tapering, I have been doing 4.5g 5 times per day and was going to drop tomorrow, my original tapering plan was:
3.75g 5 times per day

3.75g 4 times per day

3.12g 4 times per day

2.5g 4 times per day

Probably jump from there, if not then cut to 3 times per day.


**For tapering, is it better to cut down the amount per dose or the number of doses?**


I have to say it has been very helpful reading everyone's experience with quitting Kratom and has affirmed my decision to stop taking it. So thanks to everyone for posting and I will continue to lurk either way.",3

I thought I was doing something that would help me in the long run. I was going through my 3rd and last round of suboxone withdrawals when the kratom came in the mail. “Finally, I can feel normal” I thought. It was hell and I thought I was helping myself get better. A loophole through the non stop crying, pain, cold sweats and uncontrollable movements that no vitamin or benzo could alleviate. 
I should’ve fought. 
Instead here I am 7 months and two days later having to go through the same motions. 7 months of questioning wether or not I was actually better off taking the easy way out. Wether I was really sober. Wondering if I was just replacing one thing for another like I always have. Everyone on this sub convinced me that the way I had changed for the worse wasn’t actually my fault, I was stuck in the same chains I was fighting to release myself from. What a sneaky plant. 
I just took my last dose. I didn’t expect to have the time off so I had to jump a lot higher than expected, 10gpd from 25. There’s no way that what I’m going to be put through can be worse than what that orange pill did to me. Either way I won’t take the easy way out this time. I won’t try to force or beg whatever gods to make the pain and shakes stop. I’ll accept that my body needs to heal. 
So I can feel what normal is supposed to be.

Looking for advice on altering schedule," Hello! First off, I want to admit that I was one of those people that didn’t think I would have any issues with a natural to curb my social anxiety. In the beginning I found that kratom was very good at boosting my mood and alleviating my depression, while also keeping me from drinking so much. For the last 6 years I have been taking roughly 30g a day split into 5 doses. I used to really aim for every 4 hours, but this year I was starting to creep my doses even closer together and started to notice that I wasn’t necessarily feeling more relieved, but just that I was fighting off some low level dependency (most stuffy and runny nose and agitation). I also was taking it to try to keep myself from drinking too much, but I also started to drink a lot on top of it. 

I made the decision to try and get off of kratom around August because I started developing insomnia and couldn’t even begin to try and get any sleep without taking 6 grams in the middle of the night. Initially I tried to go CT, as I’ve seen quite a few people on here were taking more than me and were able to get through it. Unfortunately, I wasn’t strong enough to make it through that way. So instead, I started to taper off of it in September. Everyday I would take away at least 0.5 grams from one of my doses until the weekend, where I would hold for Saturday and Sunday, beginning to taper again on Monday.

I seemed to be doing well, moving down from 30g a day to 12g. At this point I decided to see if I could get myself down to dosing 3 times a day instead of 5. Instead of taking 2.5g 5 times a day, I moved it back up to 4g 3 times a day. Everything seemed to be moving pretty smoothly until about last week. I was able to get down to 2.5g 3 times a day, but now I’ve really been noticing some intense withdrawal symptoms mostly at night. I take my doses at 7am, 1pm and 7pm. I can’t get to sleep at all sometimes due to what I guess is RLS and racing thoughts. For the time being, my taper has halted until I start to feel stable.

With the rest of the taper running more or less smoothly for the last 10 weeks, I was kind of surprised that this would be the hardest part to deal with. I guess I’m just looking for some advice. I was really hoping to jump off at around 3g total for the day. These are some questions that I have:

Was moving to 3 doses rather than 5 a mistake?

Is it harder to hold my total dose until stability? 

When I jump off I’d have to assume that this will be worse for awhile. Am I just having so much trouble on such a low dose in relation to my previous protocol because I’m moving too fast for my body?

Lastly, I just want to thank anyone who has ever contributed to this group. I’ve been lurking for the past year and a half and it really took me until this whirlwind of a year to have the courage to try and get away from this stuff. Thank you <3",5

Today’s reading was a reminder to be grateful for all that I do have, and less focused on what I don’t have.  I am so incredibly grateful to have 3 weeks between me and my last dose.  I’m so grateful I feel as good as I do right now, I’d say I’m 95% back to normal.  Life continues to improve with more time away from k.  I can sit down and concentrate for long periods of time again.  My anxiety keeps getting better, and my energy levels are nearly back to normal.  Still some bowel issues, a little trouble staying asleep, and some minor nighttime sweating.  I am grateful for these reminders to stay clean though.  I’m not trying to be all Pollyanna, life is not perfect.  Grad school is difficult, my fiancé is away for another week, and money is tight from being a grad student and wasting it on kratom this semester.  Being clean gives me the opportunity to manage all of this though.  On K I buried my head in the sand, but being clean I can take on and handle whatever challenges life may bring.  Last thing:  Any suggestions for my lingering diarrhea?  I’m not even sure it’s from acute withdrawals since I’ve been on naltrexone for 10-11 days now.  But would probiotics help?  I’ve been eating a little yogurt daily for some probiotic benefit already.  I eat a mostly clean diet from whole food sources.  I’m drinking a lot of Gatorade zero, could that be causing it?  I also take Metamucil every night.  Any advice / insight greatly appreciated.  Thanks to everyone on this board for your support!",13

2020-11-20 07:13:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jxnyuk/third_day_agmatine_really_is_pretty_amazing/,Third day - agmatine really is pretty amazing,"I don't care if it's psycho-somatic or not, I'm just amazed it is working as well as it is.

In the first day I cut my doses from 5g to 2g and so far I haven't experienced any real discomfort, or at least not any I can attribute to WDs. Last week I tried to go CT and by 24-30 hours I was hit with the absolute vacuum of energy followed by the sneezes (oh how I fucking hate the sneezes... So endless). I caved and went and got a small bag of capsules thinking I would just take them as WD symptoms came up. I took a normal dose and it warded off the sneezes and gave me some energy but right behind that the lower back and knee aches started to set in. I ended up going thru almost the whole bag of caps just trying to get back to normal.

I know these won't be as bad as WDs from an IV heroin habit, but just the similarity of it disgusts me - I can't deal with it. My girlfriend doesn't know how badly the WDs hit me. She doesn't want anything to do with the stuff, so I'm just afraid to tell her I need to do this taper (she's on probation and is convinced they'd take our kid and send her to jail if they found out... I know this is ridiculous, but she's doing everything right and I've been pounding kratom, so who am I to argue?).

We are both in recovery, her from alcohol (3 yrs sober), myself from heroin (and everything else lol)-I've got 2 years away from drink or drug but started doing the kratom around a year sober.

Anyway - this is a long post, but I don't really have any other outlet. I don't know why I'm so embarrassed to share this deeply about this with any of my AA support group. I think it's just that they don't get it. A lot of them can't even understand drug addiction, let alone something like kratom.

Agmatine has been amazing for me. So thank you to this subreddit for the extensive information on it. I'm sure it works better for some, but for me so far it's got my doses cut in half and I'm still sleeping through the night, no aches/pains, no RLS, no sneezes - nothing. I have been taking a little more than the 2.5g of agmatine throughout the day - I usually dose 1g before my morning kratom and 1g before my late afternoon kratom, with another 1g before bed. Yesterday I took a half g in the evening too. The way I figure it is that there's no way the agmatine can be as awful as the kratom - and if it helps me say goodbye to that sooner rather than later, I'll risk an extra couple capsules of it.

Thanks to everyone here for the encouragement. To all those struggling CT - hats off to you, you can do it. Sometimes it's better to go thru the pain because it stops you from going back too easily. For those of you thinking about agmatine and a taper and whether it will work for you, I say it's worth a shot. It's really been a game changer for me. I haven't had my kratom doses down this much in probably 10 months.",9

Again yesterday it popped up in the afternoon. Then sleep was crappy last night as I had sore throat and headache all night and into this morning.

I skipped my deep breathing for now and am drinking some hot tea. Feel crappy but will take some Advil and soldier on. Not sure how productive a day work will be but at least I’ll be sober and experience it all clear headed. Oh and it’s Friday. 

Of course I’m online checking symptoms of covid and see sore throat, headache, achy and congestion listed. 😐. Not going to complain too much to my wife yet. She is holding out hope we can have her family visit for the upcoming holiday.

Fasoracetam upregulates GABA-B receptor dencity which basically is a negative tollerance to gaba-bergic drugs including endogenous GABA. However it works very well against withdrawal symptoms from these kind of drugs like Phenibut and it may not help as directly against opioid withdrawal from for example Kratom, but I could imagine that the positive effects on the GABA System may help with the sleeping, depression, anxiety and other psychological issues you get in the PAW and some also in acute WD.

NSI-189 is extremely neurodegenerative by stimulating a growth hormone for your hippocampus and is/was in clinical trials for reversing changes in the brain leading to depression and/or anxiety and I wonder if it could help reverse tollerance and brain changes due to the addiction as well when taken while tapering or in abstinence.

I would love to hear experiences with these compounds, please don't see this post as a recommendation, don't take them if you don't know what your doing and only do it at your own risk. These are just my thoughts, I can't say if those really help or worsens the withdrawals, especially because that may be a very individual thing.",2

Over the past week I have been taking steps to piece my life together and to learn to cope with my lingering PAWS.  I sat down and really thought about how I got into this predicament.  I have never abused any substance in my life.  My entire life has been on the straight and narrow until I found Kratom.  I asked my self what was it about this substance or any substance for that matter that made me go rouge?   

The answer:  I was and still am avoiding pain and suffering.  

I came to the realization that If I didn't learn to embrace the pain and suffering that comes with life I would be unhappy and an addict to SOMETHING forever.  The truth is everybody, no matter how perfect it seems, has their own demons.   EVERYBODY needs to deal their own ups and downs in life, I am not special in this regard.  

There is something to be said about suffering as it makes you a better person.  I look back on my life and look at my achievements that hardened me and all of them involve mental and physical suffering.   In high school I dropped from 230lbs to 145lbs in less than a year so that I could make the varsity football and track teams.  Endless nights of studying in college and med school so that I could pass tests and graduate.  24+ hours of call in residency due to the endless volume of patients that showed up in a level 1 trauma center.  It all sucked, but you know what it objectively made my life better, it hardened me and gave me coping skills and an education.   Each millisecond of hardship and suffering forged my character and tempered resilience.  

So where did I go wrong?  Where I went wrong is when I started looking for an easy way out.  

Instead of coping with life's hardships and dealing with the suck I turned to something that would get rid of the suck.  At first is seemed and FELT like a fantastic idea.  Getting things done without suffering seems like a win win situation.  This was a fallacy, I was tricked.  What I didn't realize is that by taking Kratom to make me feel better, I was making myself soft.  By the end of 2.5 years of abuse I was unable to cope with life organically.  I was relying on a chemical to substitute natural coping mechanisms in my brain.  I had become a sopping wet \_\_\_\_\_\_\_...  Unable to handle ANY adverse situation in life without kratom.  Every problem or hardship in life seemed like it could only be solved with a foul tasting green powder, until the day that I realized that I wasn't solving anything.  It had weakened me to a point that I had never been in my life.  I had become a fat, unmotivated, moody, intolerant amoeba.  

Only now am I learning how to temper resilience and restore my character of past.   At day 46 I can say that there is no going back now, I have found strength in my suffering.",61

The physical withdrawals are getting better, it seems... but I am cautious enough to know this is a one day at a time thing. 

I'd say the toughest part right now is the mental. 

I'm finding myself having to deal with even more heightened anxiety than I'm used to. (which is a lot.) 

Figuring out who I really am, is a wild ride. Being present is foreign.

I had my first really overwhelmingly bad craving yesterday to the point of tears, and full blown panic attack from the pits of hell.

In a weird way the finality of it seems the scariest. 

What kept me from caving this time, I reached out to multiple people and told them how I was feeling.

Something that helps me tremendously: fellowship. reaching out, being vulnerable and opening up to people who get it. 

They exist, because look at this group.

Hang in there fam. That's really all we can do if we want to get better. 🤍 This is an act of bravery.",19

It was usually 3-5 grams at night 5-7 days a week at the worst. 

Since covid, I was doing 3-5 grams every night for about 6 months. Never in all my time with kratom had I felt much urge to up the dosage. I took a trip to visit family for 4 days and decided I would quit. I successfully was clean for those 4 days, but when I got home I immediately went back. I felt really defeated and for the first time started to increase my dose. Since then I was taking 6-10 grams every night for about 2 months, which is were I was until about 3 days ago. I am 3 days clean and really determined to quit this time. I am surprised by the symptoms I have, they are worse than I was expecting. Mostly just fever symptoms, trouble sleeping through the night, and a general anxiety through the day. Anyways, I am 72 hours since dosing and kind of surprised that some of my symptoms are still lingering around, especially because I feel like I was never dosing all that much. Finding this subreddit made me realize my symptoms are probably pretty normal and that is oddly reassuring?? 

Anyways, my question is. Given my dosage and story, any idea how long/difficult my detox process will be?

A few weeks back, I quit Kratom for fifteen days after ten months of daily use. Everything was great before justifying ‘one dose’ to help me at work. Well, that one turned into nearly two weeks of continued use.

So my question is this: after quitting for fifteen days and then resuming use for two additional weeks, what can I expect as far as withdrawal this time around? 

Should I expect a full repeat of the initial quit or will this be more mild due to such a short duration?

2020-11-19 13:02:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jx7ohe/another_round_another_quit/,"Another round, Another quit","I've been lurking here for the past few days. What a great community! I wish I had known about it during my first CT from 60-70 gpd about a year ago.

So, despite what I told myself during my first quit, and with one thing leading to another, I got back up to maybe 35-40 gpd for about 7 months after not using for one year. Over the past two weeks, I've been able to taper down to 9 gpd with minimal issues. I hope that will make it a little more manageable in comparison to the last time where I had delayed wd. I don't know if this is true, but I think that was because I had such a high amount of k in my system that it took days to reach any real wd. This time, with the lower dose, I seem to go into some form of wd within a few hours, so hopefully, that will speed things up, but I'm not sure. 

I've got next week off so I'm going to jump ship tomorrow night. I've actually been counting down the days, not with apprehension, but with excitement in that I can be free from this, and that it's all up to me to become the master of my own destiny -as corny as that sounds, not this plant. 

I know it's going to suck-been there before- but I'm done. Unlike my last CT, I am not going to drink. I feel that it protracted my withdrawals last time, and I got right back into stride drinking every day for months. Luckily this time I have 9 days off and don't have to work through the whole wd like last time.

I  stocked up on BSO, ashwagandha, magnesium, 5htp, a few Ativan, trazodone (not sure about this one), and Ibuprofen. Hopefully, that will help some while I keep myself busy through the quit. 

I can't blame the plant. It has done me some good, in the sense that it has pulled me away from boozing and using harder stuff which had a way more negative impact on my life, health, and relationships than kratom. 

Sorry for the long post, I guess I just want to thank you all for showing me that I am not the only one going through this. Sometimes you forget that in your day to day.",7

I came off opiates in October last year and switched to Kratom. I started on a dose of 10gpd and eventually that escalated to 15-20gpd and at my worst 40gpd. Up until the 9th of November I was on 10-15gpd. I gradually reduced that dose. I started with 1 day at a reduced dose at the same 4 intervals, and then one day a larger dose 2 intervals, then kept reducing. So one day to let the body adjust to a reduced dose and one day at that dose with larger intervals (definitely experience withdrawals on those days, but not so bad). Once I got to a very small dose roughly 2g at 8hrs apart I bought phenibut and black seed oil to get through, supplemented with 5HTP occasionally. Very effective, but be warned with phenibut, if you think you will abuse it then best to stay away. You have to be serious about quitting. Today is my first day of 2gpd. I'm almost off.

I started taking two capsules a day and just like anything else ive gotten tolerant to such a low dosage. Im now taking 3/4 of an opms shot 3 times a day. Ive had chest pains for two days straight. Due to covid outbreak and chest pain being one of the emergency symptoms of it, i finally broke down and went to the er. No corona. Ekg and chest xray came back fine. I couldnt work up the courage to tell the er dr about kratom. I was so afraid of the stigma that comes along with it. And the second i would say it i knew my level of care was going to decrease drastically. He also checked for a pulminary embolism. Still nothing. It has to be the kratom. Ive been wanting to quit for a long time anyway. I have seizures and anytime i would quit cold turkey i would have one. I almost said something to my neurologist but once again i was a coward. He prescribed me cbd with thc from a dispensary and i start that next week. He said cdb and thc raises the seizure threshold in the body so its good for epilepsy. And thats supposed to help with help with restlessness too that i feel frequently when i withdrawing from kratom. Ive waited this long to quit because my husband will be off for thanksgiving and i need someone to keep an eye on me. Im terrified. Im scared im gonna have a seizure that i wont wake up from. Im scared these chest pains are my bodys way of telling me its had enough from kratom. But i cant go on like this!!! i have to quit. Today i will go down to a little more than half a shot three times a day for a few days. And then a half a shot. Hopefully my chest quits hurting in the mean time. Please wish me luck.

First day cold turkey today and a 10-15gpd habit which lasted around 16 months.

I started kratom because I had problems with alcohol and cocaine, it helped me with that as I no longer have that problem.

I've had a quite a lot of emotion this morning, some anger and saddness but generally feeling ok.

I'm quitting because it doesn't even do anything for me anymore, I don't get motivation and I feel like it is taking away by thinking, my emotions, my creativity and many other things.

Drug user for about half my life. 28 m. No needles but everything else. Started with weed, graduated to powders, coke and molly, pills - adderall, oxy. Had a big fight with oxy back in college, coming off around 150mg per day those withdrawals were hell.. 

Fast forward to mid 20’s and haven’t had really any serious drug issues, been a daily weed smoker and kratom user for the past 3-4 years with a few month break here and there.

Last month I hit 90 days CT from  k, around 150gpd concentrates. Of all the quits I’ve done this one was probably the worst. It took around 40 days to have a solid bowel movement. The sweats went on for god knows how long. Anyway, once I started feeling good, I randomly walked into the smoke shop (like a zombie-not even paying attention) and picked up a shot (concentrate). Within a few days I was back to 5-7 shots per day. Which is around 150gpd. Luckily I caught myself and only let this happen for a week or two. Withdrawals aren’t nearly as bad this time around. Luckily, but it does suck to set back recovery. Dealing with sleep, sweats, chills, Gi issues. 

Word of advice, stay vigilant, this sneaky bastard has a way of getting back into ones life fairly easily. Well at least for me.  It’s happened a few times after long breaks.

So I did the following in 20°F ( -6°C) outside, wearing shorts, a T-shirt and wool cap and gloves. (I'm practicing ""Cold Exposure"" as part of Wim Hof Method in preparation for my first ice bath sometime in the near future.) This *may* be helpful as a starting point for those who are tapering to quit, withdrawaling or are maintaining recovery and are perhaps ""out of shape"" like me.

* ""Warm-up"" by stretching, walking, etc.
* 10x ""laps"" light jogging up and back in my backyard
* 3 x 25 Jumping Jacks
* 3 x 10 Standing Inclined Push-ups (shoulder-length apart) against the side of my car. Keep back straight and look to the sky.
* 3x ""Sprints"" in my backyard, up a hill in the middle of each ""lap""
* (Always keep moving in between sets and exercises. Simply walking or pacing is fine. Just keep your heart rate up and maintain good posture. Disclaimer: Obviously, consult a physician before starting any exercise program.)

This took only 20 minutes, got my heart rate nice and elevated, and is more of a ""total body workout"" than my normal morning jog / walk. 

I did 3 rounds of Wim Hof Method breathing exercises before this and took a Cold Shower immediately after, while my heart rate was still elevated.

I think I'll do this outdoor exercise routine whenever I feel like breaking the monotony of my normal morning jog. I really enjoyed it and look forward to seeing how I improve. (Exercising in the cold this week has been amazing!) Obviously, tailor it to your own needs or create your own. The point is **keep moving**!

Have a great day, fellow quitters!",5

I'm noticed that, while taking kratom, the smell of my urine dramatically changed. 

The smell became more pronounced, not in a good way.

I'm thinking the repugnant smell is related to me, inadvertently, changing the landscape of my dopamine, serotonin, and  noradrenaline reflected in my urine.

I'm three weeks out from my last dose of kratom and my urine still smells horrible  : /

First time post here. I always thought if I was posting something it would be on the pro-kratom boards. I do still think for many people the substance is benign and can be a very effective tool. However, for me, it is far too effective for me to control.

I originally found kratom just over 4 years ago when looking for alternatives to opioid painkillers for my father. He didn't find it helpful and I was going through a very experimental time, so I tried it and it was love at first dose. I didn't respect the drug enough and I was instantly hooked. Though I didn't acknowledge that I was becoming addicted I took kratom the majority of days, 1-4x daily within a month of discovering it. Doses were all around 3g, as that's the buzz I liked. Started capsuling and taking the stuff almost daily. I told myself that because I took a day or two off per week I wasn't forming a habit.

The reason I love kratom is that it has always felt like the cure to what ails me. When I'm on it I'm not anxious, depressed, tired, unmotivated, fearful, or apprehensive. When I first found the drug it allowed me to overcome hurdles in my life that had been in my way for years. I began to justify my addiction on the grounds that it was worth living the life it gave me.

Well, that didn't last. Within about a year it was either take escalating doses and have greater mood swings, or just succumb to withdrawal on days off dosing. I was too afraid of dosing more so I just kept taking between 8 and 12 g/day to stave off withdrawal. Eventually this became every day. I began to need kratom to work, socialize, or sometimes just to cope with existence. 

When Covid hit, I said I'd stop. The fear of getting sick while addicted to kratom terrifies me. Unfortunately, the toll Covid took on my mental health drove me back into an ever worsening habit. I attempted my first taper this summer and lasted til 3g per day then could get no further. It was like every day was the worst day of my life, and the tapered doses weren't helping. I gave up and told myself I'd just take it until I quit drinking, which of course I couldn't do.

What finally whipped me into shape was my shop closing down. I realized my stock of capsules wouldn't last until my delivery from a new store unless I deliberately and quickly tapered down. I went from 20 750mg capsules a day to 19 and then 18 and so on. I knew I could never do it hungover so I gave myself one last hurrah on Halloween then cut alcohol out too. 

I did receive another kg of kratom on time, made capsules too. I haven't taken a single one.

Its now day 18 no alcohol and day 12 no kratom. What's different this time is that I think I'm over kratom, in a romantic sense. I got carried away by this cure all happy pill I could make for almost nothing from a cheap plant I got online. Now I see kratom in a different light. There is no happy ending for me with that plant. It's time for me to find my kicks somewhere new.

I still feel some desire to dose. Not because I'm struggling too badly, just because I know it's the only way I've found true pleasure in my life the last 4 years. My withdrawals were surprisingly easy the first few days. I actually felt joy and elation the first day CT. I've taken that as a sign to keep with it. This second week has been worse. My brain feels more tired, I'm depressed and anxious, and everything is a forced struggle. But hey, I'm doing it. I'm not checking my pockets to make sure I have capsules before leaving the house. When I go to bed, I think of tomorrow. When I wake up, I get out of bed.

I feel I should be giiving away my stock of kratom. I don't feel anxiety being far from it anymore, and there's enough of it for me to completely fuck my life up again.

The one thing I'm grateful to kratom for is for teaching me I need help. I always thought my depression and anxiety were normal enough. As long as I could be on drugs 95% of my life I was fine. Now feeling how much worse that makes things has made me want help from other tools, namely self care and therapy. 

Amyways, that's enough out of me. If you read this, I appreciate your concern and hope my story can educate or inspire in some way. I know reading other peoples stories has helped me push through the pain.

Wish me luck in keeping sober. I'm proud of every day.",11

My wife and I had a surprise baby girl 3 years ago, when our previous two boys were 7 and 10. Having an oops in our mid 30's proved to be a big challenge, and we stumbled on to K as a way to boost our energy about the time she started walking. At first it was all positives, but with the massive financial crunch of this pandemic, and my hours having been cut back 20%, I have come to the conclusion that too much of our budget has been going to the green monkey. I scaled back to 16 GAD for about 3 days, felt fine, and then dropped to 8 GAD for 5 days, and was still getting through my day with no real troubles. So, I decided to not buy any more after my last morning dose three days ago. Now I'm only at the end of day 2 of CT, but I had 3-4 full blown panic attacks today, and both days I've felt super flu-y, and I keep waking up and not being able to go back to sleep. I even burst into tears twice today, and that hasn't happened to me in over a decade!

2020-11-18 14:52:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jwmzdb/just_starting/,Just Starting...,"I was a daily IV heroin user for about seven years, with some stints in rehab or sober living situations. I ended up getting sober two years ago through AA (I basically just had a ""I like everything"" addiction problem, and my slippery slope always started with alcohol). Shortly after getting sober, I was having my first child, buying my first home, buying a new car, starting college for the first time - basically doing all of the things heroin prevented my doing for those years.

I do engage in mental health care and am responsible about taking my medications as prescribed, as I know the role they played in my getting sober.

At some point during this period of incredible change (and stress), I remembered hearing about this thing called kratom, so I looked it up. It seemed like a good deal - it's a plant, it'll help with anxiety/depression/pain (I've got knee issues and at the time worked in the restaurant industry), and it's not a drug, right? Wrong.

I started behaving in all of the same ways I behaved during my heroin addiction, to include taking money from my own family (including my newborn son) to fund a habit that was very clearly out of control. I hid it all for as long as I could but recently the curtain has come down and I've had to face and own up to many, many things.

Needless to say, I need to quit. I've acquired some agmatine and I intend on doing a relatively fast taper. I tried to go CT, but as soon as I felt those similar WD symptoms as heroin, I freaked.

I'm doing about 18-20 gpd in three doses usually. I was using 3-4 Mit45s per day for a short while there as well, but have stopped using those and am just using capsules again. If I don't quit, I will very likely lose the family and the life that I built by getting sober in the first place.

I guess I'm just wanting to share with others who understand. My AA sponsor doesn't know the first thing about kratom (or heroin for that matter), and everyone in my support network is as clueless. It's not their fault, but it doesn't make for the best support if the other person doesn't really know what it's like (which is why 12 step programs work in the first place).

That's my rant. I'll try and start checking in here when I can. For now, reading all of your posts has been encouraging.",14

Literally the only thing to look forward to is WD when you’re taking kratom and you know you shouldn’t be. It’s sad to think about and here some of us are just punishing ourselves over and over and for what?! What did we do to deserve this?! We all keep thinking during acutes “Please make it stop” when we’ve been holding the keys to our prison the entire time! This isn’t something that we leave to chance, we decide whether we’re done suffering or not. We all know kratom is “pretty” on the outside but it’s on the inside that matters. And the inside isn’t very pretty at all. It’s telling us one thing when we’re high and at the same time it’s stealing from us everything and everyone we love most. It’s robbing us of everything. Idk about you guys but I don’t like being stolen from. We gotta make like OJ and steal our own stuff back! Yes the last part was to maybe brighten some people’s day.

I have been tapering off 42 gpd and am down to 24 gpd as of yesterday.  It hasn't been easy but it has been fairly free of WD.

I have not followed a strict schedule but when my body is fully adjusted to the lower dose, I drop again.  I dose every 4 hrs and am down to 4.5g when I wake up, 3.5g throughout the day and 6.5 when it's time to go to sleep.  I plan on keeping this up until I am down to .5 or 1g every 4hrs and will then jump.  I understand some can't taper but try taking it slow, use a digital scale for accuracy and give it a try.  I have already noticed my mood and sex drive are improving.  Very excited to be free of the sludge but am not going to rush it.",9

Its strange how WD has been different every time.  Sometimes i fell physically ill and super lethargic but this go around i just feel zero motivation and its super subtle and was freaking me out yesterday. I contribute this to environmental and emotional states along with dosage.  I can ramble on a lot about these variables in the 15-20 Gpd range if you want to know what works best for me just ask. 

The main point of this post is to highlight the use of non narcotic supplements as aid to the process.  I picked up DLPA last night and so far its a god send. With my WD experience the brain fog and lack of motivation is what makes me relapse every time. ""DLPA"" is an amino acid stack the ultimately gives a boost of dopamine, the well being/ reward transmitter. 

Dopamine or lack there of is what keeps us and other users of drugs seeking more drugs. There's an argument against using any dopamine enhancing compounds while detoxing and i agree but that's on the narcotic getting high front in my book.  You cant get high off AA's.  

The point is recovery, i'm not sure if I'm experiencing placebo but i honestly don't care at this point. I have slight cravings and slight lack of motivation but its nothing like yesterday(day 2). There's no shame in placebo or having a supplement holding your hand and keeping you away from Kratom. If you're like me and cave during paws because you cant handle the relentless lack of motivation then do your research on DLPA. You can pick it up at the vitamin store.

Today I believe is day 143 for me without kratom. I haven't posted in a while because I was dealing with this breathing issue when I quit kratom, and it was the only thing on my mind for months. It  was/is the symptom that bothered me most. So now that it's close to 4.5 months down, I am happy to say I am finally feeling like the breathing issue is on its way out. So at this point I wanted to share a few things I noticed going through it that hopefully may help someone else. So here goes. 

This experience itself was one of the worst things I've ever been through. I've been through multiple drug withdrawals, amphetamine, heroine, and even weed (yes weed has withdrawals if what you smoke is strong enough). Nothing was like this, I wanted to kill myself at least 4 times a day for over two months. 

I spent most of my day feeling like I was gasping for air trying to search the internet and talking to doctors to find answers, but nobody had any. At least not any that could be attributed to me. 

It was terrible. Little by little though, after 3 months down it got better, albeit slowly, it was still getting better. 

It would happen in episodes that got shorter and shorter, but not by much. It started out lasting weeks at a time, for the first month. Then I'd have one or two days of calm, then it came back and stretched into the second month. Weeks of gasping for air. Then by month three I noticed a difference, but was still having episodes they'd last for a day or two then a day or two of calm. It never went away during the calm days, it was just more bearable. Now, like I stated above, I'm 4.5 months in and I'm doing better. Well enough in fact that I decided to do a little experiment. I have no interest in taking kratom ever again, and so I have not.

Now, as far as I can tell, in my limited knowledge of what could be causing this, it may somehow be receptor related; and tied to the autonomic nervous system. 

Please take that with a grain of salt, I'm no expert. That's what my reading and experiment has lead me to believe.

Anyone else who has this issue, please do not go down the rabbit hole of Adrenal fatigue, everything I've read from reputable sources says it's not real and my adrenals were fine when tested. I had everything tested except my stomach and even that seems to be much better. 

 The only thing I've found that helps for this, is time. I am sure if the inclination was there science could do something about it, but it doesn't seem to be. So, if your in this situation too, you have to wait it out. At times I thought things were helping and they weren't. Exercise, eating a certain way, laying a certain way, breathing exercises, the whole nine, none of it worked. Just time. 

I know people are going to say Anxiety! It's not anxiety, I definitely had it bad for the first month. However, after about halfway through month 2 that went away with meds and the breathing issue was still there. 

It's still here now, just nowhere near as bad. It seems to coincide perfectly with how long I took kratom for. As my mind started getting clearer, I realized that I was on kratom for 6 years! I know there are people who were on it longer, but everyone's experience is different.

If your on kratom and find yourself not breathing well when it wears off, you may have a similar issue to what I did, or do. If you have stopped kratom just keep going, this shit sucks, but just keep at it. My doctor put me on lexapro for anxiety and trazodone for sleep and they've helped me immensely. Neither is habit forming and if you need something like that, just get it. No sense in suffering more than you have to. 

Well, I think that's about it. I really wish I could be more help than this. I hope knowing that it will get better is a comfort. 

Your all amazing, and keep at it. We're all here together doing this and as far as I know this will be a battle that we fight for some time to come.

Be safe everyone.",13

Back pain KICKING MY ASS! And I’m sneezing like crazyyyyy. Taking BC powders a couple times a day. Getting used to my anti seizure meds and anti anxiety meds (even though I swear they don’t do shit) I Slept for more than 4 hours last night so my eyes are starting to look a little more human again. I braided my hair and put make up on for the first time yesterday too. And I’m down five pounds (one the positives of withdrawal) at least for a 28 year old girl ha. Stomach is still a mess but I accompany some of that to my anxiety. 😓 I spent the first 48 hours of withdrawal in the hospital. (Had my first grand mal seizure at work which doc attributed to Kratom use and lack of sleep) since EEG and CT scan came back clean 🙏 

This recovery has been a total bitch. Not going to lie to any of you in the spot where I am or if you just quit for your first time, like me. But the weather is beautiful where I am. I’m about to walk my pup on the trail, jam some happy tunes and thank the universe that I’m alive. I hope you all find the little things to be happy about today. If you can get through today..guess what? You can get through tomorrow too. 

Also I’m open to any positive tools to help me through the rest of this healing process for those of you who have been through the worst of the withdrawal already or have some good coping mechanisms?

thanks in advance!

I am SO grateful to be feeling as good I am right now.  My energy levels are nearly back to normal.  I’m sleeping 7-8 hours a night, and my depression isn’t acting up.  Just some small pockets of anxiety that are totally manageable.  I’m also grateful the physical withdrawal is lingering, this is a wonderful lesson to never relapse.  This isn’t my first kratom rodeo, and this has been the most protracted physical withdrawal by far.  Cool thing is I never have to do this again.  Been leaning on NA / friends & family / this board for support, and it’s helping a ton.  Staying busy is also helping me a great deal.

Started using kratom 3 years ago. First year was full force multiple times a day. Second year was very controlled. Life was great other than this addiction so I somehow managed to keep it to 2-3 times a week and avoid true physical dependency while functioning at a high level at work and at home. I knew if I did kratom every day things would fall apart and somehow kept myself from it

Fast forward to the beginning of quarantine and I picked up a large stash and went to using multiple times day every day. It is now impacting my relationships, my physical appearance (use to be big and muscular now I feel/look deflated), and making me a lackluster performer at work. I’ve been trying to wean down for a few months and have been unable. I get down low to maybe 5 grams then something stressful comes like a presentation at work or a big social event and I end up back on high doses again (high for me which is like 15 grams). 

My last dose was today just before noon so it’s been about 12 hours. Hoping that posting here will help with some level of accountability since nobody around me really knows the extent of what I am going through. I know you are strangers but I hate disappointing anybody so mentally it will help knowing I told somebody I quit, even if I don’t know them. 

If anybody else is quitting today please comment — the worst feeling is thinking you are going through a withdrawal on your own so maybe it will help both of us to check in on each other from time to time and provide some encouragement (and accountability). I’ve quit other opiates in the past and know this from experience.

I will not be using any “helper meds” except for black seed oil and magnesium. In the past, I’ve made it through the physical with some strong helper meds (phenibut + marijuana) and failed because of how easy it was. 

I just want to feel like my old, social, happy self again so bad! Hoping that if I force myself to feel every second of this it will reinforce why I can never take kratom again — not even once.

Thanks for listening!",5

(Background story is that I’ve been getting sick for no real apparent reason since I was 5 and throughout my entire life, doctors always just blamed stress. But none of my episodes have ever lasted as long as my last one and doctors say it’s from kratom and weed along w my underlying issues that no one wants to help me pinpoint) I was sick for three weeks, I’d throw up anything that I drank, or ate, water included. I lost 20 pounds in 18 days. I was so weak, and in pain that I couldn’t speak when people spoke to me, and I’d pass out and sleep as they were talking to me. My family was really worried, so I had to go get an IV at the hospital eventually, even though I’m scared of Covid while already being weak, and the doctors told me to stop taking Kratom because of the lack of studies on it, and to quit smoking weed, or I would just end up in the hospital again. So I quit everything, I still vape but not as much. It was easier to deal with the withdrawals at first bc bc I would just pass out from exhaustion and pain in my stomach after violently vomiting. I got meds for my stomach, and nausea, and I was feeling my withdrawal symptoms fade away (body aches, hot sweats, runny nose, and the constant need to move my muscles around bc I was never comfortable), none of those made me wanna even try going back to kratom even after my stomach started healing. But what is making me feel like I need to find a solution is the post acute withdrawal symptoms. I’ve lost all motivation, and I feel empty and dead inside. Music doesn’t help anymore, nothing does. Even though chamomile to calm my anxiety works, I’m left with a void in my chest. A black cold hole. I was taking a lot of kratom before I got sick. Close to 9 grams a day. It kept me working well, happy to work, and happy to be around and help out my (toxic) family. Now that I’m sober everyone wants me to act like who I was while I was taking kratom, and I don’t know how to explain to them that, that person feels so out of reach. I’m irritable, weak, and tired, I can work with those though. What I can’t deal with is this feeling that I don’t care about anything and just wanna sleep, yet can’t even sleep. I don’t wanna work but I need to go back soon. I quit one of my jobs while I was sick bc my manager yelled at me and hung up because I was sick and couldn’t come in, and no one would answer me about picking up my shift. So now I have to deal with interviews all over again, and one of the biggest reasons I started taking kratom was bc I’m job interview/ Job in general nervous as shit. I feel like I’m spiraling, I need a psychiatrist but I’m scared of the medications they’ll put me on, the last batch didn’t work, which is why I just decided to take Kratom to help me. I know I’m supposed to take vitamin C and other vitamins for this feeling to go away, but my stomach can’t handle all of those right now. I’m still on a strictly liquid boost diet, and am being told to stay away from acidic things bc my stomach is raw and red from the stomach acid, and am scared. I don’t wanna vomit for 9 hours again.",1

I'm not even sure how much I was using towards the end, but probably anywhere from 60-80 grams a day. Every 2 hours I'd be swallowing it by the spoonful.

I used it for 8 months. Trying to kick a fentanyl addiction. Got to the point where I started using the kratom just because I liked how it made me feel.

Lost a bunch of weight, my hair started falling out a ton. Literally everywhere I went I was finding my hair everywhere. I was starving myself just so I could prepare for my next dose. 

I'm still noticing some physical symptoms. I still have the runs, stomach is constantly cramping, bloated and sharp abdominal pains. Cold chills still especially at night. The anxiety and restlessness has gone away but occasionally at night I will wake up feeling like I'm in a panic and it takes me a while to fall back asleep.

I've been taking clonidine and it has definitely helped a ton. The cravings are all but gone. Having weird ass dreams though but at least I can remember what I'm dreaming now lol. 

Nose is still runny a bit, lots of sneezing. I'm hoping by my month mark at least the chills go away. It's driving me nuts being cold 24/7 even with layering and turning the heat up on blast. Feels like the only relief I get from the cold is when I completely submerge myself in a scalding hot bath that turns me bright red.

The withdrawals aren't anywhere near as bad as fent but fuck. It all still sucks.

The depression is hitting pretty bad, and my therapist is working with me on dosing and different scripts for anxiety and depression so hopefully we find something that works.

I am a past opioid addict (like it seems many of us here are) who has been clean for going on 7 years now and actually managed to get my stuff together and make a pretty good life for myself.  After the lockdown happened, I began drinking way more than I had -- although if I am being honest, it was pretty much every night before then too.  The drinking led to me starting to smoke cigarettes again.  I actually came across Kratom while looking for something to help me quit smoking, so I picked up a couple oz and took it one weekend I had set aside for that fact.

Looking back now, this is one of the dumbest things I have ever done.  

I did actually manage to quit smoking that weekend but this substance felt GOOD.  That part of my brain that I had managed to somewhat repair by abstaining from opiates was now being activated again.  The warning signs were there and I should have known better.  I researched the substance and found out about its mu-opioid activation and decided to stop as soon as I ran out.  That period lasted 4 days until a stressful day at work - I drove to the Kratom store on my lunch break and bought a couple oz and ate some in the parking lot.  Just like that -- all the new behaviors and coping mechanisms I had learned over the last several years were now being suppressed as my brain was craving this substance.  Pretty quickly I picked smoking back up.

I used this substance every day varying from 10-60gpd up until about 6 weeks ago when I made the decision to go CT from 60gpd.  I wasn't sure how bad it would be as I wasn't taking it nearly as long as a lot of the people on here, but it is still easily one of the worst weeks of my life.  The physical part was not near as bad as some of the WD I have been through in the past, but the mental part was just absolutely devastating.  My moods were all over the place and seemed to change by the minute.  This was perhaps exaggerated by the utter lack of sleep I managed to get for pretty much the entire first week.  Nothing helped my RLS.

Day 14 comes around and I was feeling a lot better, so I had a few drinks.  I was quite hungover the next morning and felt like death - so I decided that just this one I could go buy only one oz and eat some K just to get through the day.  Well you know how that goes.  Took it just that day, then didn't take it for 3 days.  Found a way to justify taking it one more day.  It's been back to daily use for the past 3 weeks.

Kratom robs me of pretty much all motivation and ambition in life.  I wake up feeling crappy until I have my first dose.  I feel somewhat normal after that first dose for maybe an hour or two but its not enough.  I re-dose to chase that feeling but it's fleeting.  It makes me feel like I have this pressure inside my head that can make it really difficult to actually think.  Later on in the day I just feel so exhausted - I know this substance is draining all the energy out of my body.  In the beginning it made me feel relaxed and confident but now I'm lucky if I get a moment of hope amidst of waves of anxiety and depression.  I quit my job a few months ago because it was just making my miserable.  I know it was, but I also know that this substance greatly contributed to the overall anxiety.  I haven't had the motivation to really look for anything else since.

I need to stop, and this next time, I am never picking this stuff up again.  I need to get my life back.

Here's to quitting 11/20.",25

4 years on kratom with 1 year clean in the middle. 9g, 4 times per day. Toss n wash.

I've tried going cold turkey a few times and I physically felt not too bad but I couldn't deal with the emotional issues and suicidal thoughts. 

My kratom usage has turned me into a recluse and I've pushed away everyone in my life. I literally have nobody. Ironically, Kratom has helped me deal with the loneliness by numbing my emotions but now I know that's not a long term strategy. I'm beginning to feel dangerously lonely even when I use kratom (unless I keep increasing my dose). So I need to get my life back on track. But this transition period is hard, especially with covid because it makes socializing hard or almost impossible. I miss human touch. I feel so empty. The times I tried to go cold Turkey I just couldn't shake the suicidal thoughts by around the 24hr mark so I would take another small dose. Even though it felt like a step backwards, it made the suicidal thoughts go away. I didnt really feel like there was any other choice. I was really worried and definitely a danger to myself. I just couldn't shake the bad thoughts and there's nobody I could turn to for help except social programs or counselors that just call the cops on you if you admit you're feeling suicidal. To be clear, I am NOT suicidal at this moment so don't report this post.

So my strategy is to log my doses and how I feel a few times per day while trying to go as far as I can between doses. The idea came from a diet I heard about. They say to take pictures of all the junk food you eat and you're less likely to eat as much. I guess if you write it down or acknowledge it in some way, the reality of it hits you subconsciously.

I've been logging things for 3 days and so far I'm down to 5g twice per day. I physically feel ok and would like to go down faster but I honestly don't think I can survive the emotional part of withdrawal. My emotions have been numbed for so long I dont remember how to deal with them. It's so overwhelming. I guess dealing with a breakup doesnt help either. 

If I'm not on the right track please tell me. I've wasted quite a few years thinking I was making progress when I actually wasnt. Any other advice would be great too. Thanks everyone.

TLDR: is logging your doses a good way of quitting?",4

For the past year or so, I’ve used it socially off and on as an alternative to drinking. Most the time the experience was pretty benign, but in the last couple months I noticed myself getting increasingly irritable when taking larger doses. I’d snap at things a lot easier and would feel an unpleasant restless energy. But for whatever reason I continued to take it just to have something to do. 

Yesterday, there was a “buy two get one free” special at the kratom bar. I decided to take advantage of this and had three large drinks mixed with a strong red strain. Boy was this a mistake. After battling waves of nausea for the next few hours, I settled in at home to try and sleep it off. I felt this horrible sensation of wanting to crawl out of my skin, my thoughts were racing and anxiety was going through the roof. I have some mental health issues I deal with in the first place but most the time it’s manageable. But it seemed like the kratom was bringing out the worst in my obsessive thinking and taking mood liability to an extreme. I got so bothered by it at one point that I started hitting myself in an irrational effort to get rid of it. The entire night was spent getting up every half hour to piss, struggling to get it out (a terrible side effect), and lying it bed ruminating miserably. It shocked me how far this plant threw me off the deep end and I vowed not to touch it again. I’m glad I never got into taking it everyday, god knows what would’ve come of my mental state if that were the case. 

I feel a bit better today after drinking a lot of water, but am still a little off. Needless to say I won’t be repeating the experience.",9

For all of you who are suffering the worst right now, stay strong because it will end. On day 15 I was still feeling the acutes and thought it would never get better, but it does. This support group really helped remind me why I was doing this and not to give in when I was at my worst.

 28 days CT, I lost some weight, still have sleep and some gastrointestinal problems, but every day is better than the last. 

Magnesium, ashwaghanda, DLPA, immodium, and kava really do help, just don't take them longer than you need.

Stay the hell away from benzos! If you think withdrawing from kratom is bad...

The best part? Now I don't constantly have to worry about making sure I have kratom on me, always knowing where my next dose is. That feels great after all this time being a slave to that plant. 

Thank you to all of you for your support, we can all make it to the other side.",36

I've been lurking this sub for the past year or so. Mainly for seeking out hope and trying to find the will power to take the necessary steps to quit Kratom for good. The purpose of this thread is to mainly get this off my chest, but also to ask about your guys' experiences quitting Kratom through an inpatient program.

Some background about me: I'm 29. I started drinking at the age of 16 due to depression.. mostly as a result of an abusive alcoholic father. I began using Kratom 4 years ago as a 'less harmful' substitute that would still give me some escapism from the outside world. At first it was a life saver. It gave me energy and euphoria and I felt better about myself overall because, in my mind, 'I was no longer an alcoholic'!

Flash forward to now. I'm a 60-70 gpd user with a 2 year relationship on lifesupport, no friends, and a career thats passing me by. This drug has overtaken my life in every facet. I no longer have to willpower to work or socialize. All I want to do it stay home and take kratom. All I think about is my addiction. Before all this I was social, relatively intelligent, and hardworking. I feel like those qualities no longer exist about myself and honestly it makes me sick to my stomach that my mental energy and capacity for anything other than Kratom is gone.

As far as my attempts with quitting, I've tried quitting numerous times but have never made it past 24 hours. The physical and especially mental effects of withdrawal are unbearable for me. I've also tried tapering a few times but i always lack discipline to do so and the attempts don't last long.

Today I've finally sought out help and made an appointment with an addiction counselor. My goal is to enter a 30 day program at a local treatment facility. I feel much more confident that I'll follow through if I have a support system and proper medical care around me. The only thing stopping me is I need to find some time off work.. possibly talking to my boss about everything that's been going on and use FMLA to take the necessary time. I just fear his perception about me would change.

What are your guys' experiences with going to rehab for Kratom? Did they know anything about it/have experience treating a Kratom addiction? Was the first visit successful for long term recovery? What's your opinion/experience of a short term suboxone treatment? 

Thank you guys for hearing me out.",2

Four years on kratom just about. Some days running up to 70 grams thru my body. In-fucking-sane when you think about it logically. Oddly enough, this time isn’t that bad. Some discomfort mentally, stomach discomfort, and some restless leg usually about 9pm. Other than that I’ve been able to sleep enough to function. I guess I’m one of the lucky ones who never was miserable going thru a kratom withdrawal. But I’ve also abused every other drug prior to kratom. I quit for 6 months and started again. Stupid! Here I am on day 3. The worst is probably the cravings and wanting to say fuck this discomfort. But I’m not. I’m ready to level up in life. I’m 30 with 2 kids. I need to leave them with something. Starting college again this spring. Grabbed a raise at work. And just received some property handed down from my pops. Kratom keeps you stagnant. Kratom keeps you complacent. Screw that!! Life is to short to stay stuck ingesting a green sludge just to be able to get motivated. I’m 3 days in. And this time I’m done for good. Maybe I’m not doing this for me yet. But I know I’m strong enough to make myself believe it is for me, that way I can stay off this shit. I’m so sick and tired of being sick and tired. I’m ready to make some life changes and leave something for my daughters. I’ve been on some kind of substance for 15 years now. It’s time to live life the way it was intended before I’m 60 and then what? Nah. Not happening. Any and everyone of you guys can do this, if I can. Just DO IT. Don’t think about it, work out, take supplements. There are all kinds that help. Sobriety tends to show you it’s better once you make it there. I’ve seen it time and time again. Every time I clean up, life seems to get so much better. Then I go back to a substance and just stick myself in that spot for however long I’m on it. Not doing it anymore. Going up! Good luck y’all.

Had been using kratom for 2 years daily. Slowly got up to 4x a day yada yada we know how that goes. Was taking about 28gpd on average. I had wanted to.quit for the better part of a year. Before kratom, I had multiple years of recovery.  Attempted to come off my mental.health meds with a Dr and it left me in a fucked up place. Unfortunately I tried and became addicted to kratom. The shame and guilt alone was killing me.

I am not new to addiction. Struggled all thru my teens and early 20s with it. Multiple rehab and detox stays. Methadone, Suboxone, switching drugs all that. It was never about the substance it was about my need to escape my feelings. Anyways back to the taper.

I've had multiple attempts this last year at tapering, all unsuccessful. I think I got down to about 12gpd with the use of another ""natural supplement"" but always found myself right back where I started. Maybe itll hit again? Maybe I can do less? Nah none of that shit worked.

I started my final taper 2-3 months ago. Started at 28gpd between 4 servings. I started dropping .5g from each dose daily until I had dropped .5 for all 4. So 2 g total over 4 days. Than I would stabilize for about 3 days give her take(depending how i felt, sometimes longer). At some point i switched to 3x a day. That was a little tougher. Would wake up with mild wds. Once I got to 4gx3 I switched back to 3gx4. Stabilized there for a few days and continued with protocol. Once down to 1gx4 I dropped a dose so now down to 1gx3. States here for a few days than on the final day 11/9/20 o took 2.5g total. Decided that it was time. The lower I got the less I cared about what strain I took. I was a so called ""connoisseur"". Only bought small batch ""premium"" leaf and had plenty of kgs. That monday I tossed 98% of my stash. Still had a little reservation about it being tough and needing some just in case.

Tuesday wasnt bad. Yawned a bunch, a little tired throughout the day and could not trust a fart! Slept like a baby that night. Wed was similar but woke up after a couple.hours of sleep with some RLS. Smoked some hempflower and fell back asleep an hour later. The rest has been a piece of cake.

I havent felt this free in years. I've been through this before with harder drugs and when I quit I obsessed about using for.months. just refused to do so. I dont want kratom at all. I'm over it. Ot served a small purpose but ended up leading to alot of issues.

Sex drive has come back with a vengeance. Confidence in myself is up. Excitement and motivation for life is up. The fog I was in was.ridiculous looking back. Numb to everything. Chasing and cou ting down hours before my next fix. The freedom is unreal. No more hoding out in. Bathrooms and rushing off to sneak a dose. Cant explain how good it feels.

I forgot to mention I tossed the couple hundred grams I had left away about 3 days in. No need for it. I'm just writing this to encourage anyone wanting to get off to stick to a taper. I also set a goal of being off a week before thanksgiving to be able to fully enjoy it. I quit 2 weeks before! Create a plan, stick to said plan, if u slip dont let it ruin you. Get back to it and see it thru. This is day 8 and I'm good as can be. Didnt miss a day of work, Continued to exercise, continued to hang out with my girl and do everything else I usually do. This doesnt have to be the hell I've read so much about. I feel for those that jump at such a high dose. That just wasnt really.an option for me. Part of the taper was to practice self discipline as well.which I succeeded in. That in it's own right is a confidence booster and does wonders for self esteem. Keep fighting the good fight you guys.",21

I'm on day 8 of my 4th quit and while I feel overall better about myself, less guilty, and like I'm moving in the right direction, I still have very little motivation to do work.  During my other quits, I've just plunged headfirst into exercising and healthy eating- both of which I'm sure helped kick my butt into gear, but this time I'm just not feeling motivated to do anything.  

I'm not in dire straights, financially, but my livelihood does depend on reaching out to old clients, or finding new ones.  On kratom, I loved this because I wanted to talk to everyone (assuming it was during the hour or so following my dose).  I know that idle hands are the devil's playground, but I'm wondering if you think I should give myself any sort of break, or just tough it out and fake it till I make it.  It would be great to hear from others who don't get a steady paycheck, but I'll take all of the feedback I can get! 

Side-note, it's not like I don't do anything.  I have a 16 month old at home and keep him entertained for a good part of the day.  My wife also works and does earn a steady paycheck, but not enough to support us for sure.  Again, I'm financially ok for the time being.  It's just the anxiety kicking back in and the uncertainty of the future getting to me.  Also again, I'm sure intense exercising would help.  My problem is I'm also OCD, so when I do something, it sort of consumes my brain, if that makes sense.  Like if I missed a workout day, I'd feel pretty bad.  I'm working towards just having a healthy, balanced life rather than needing the extremes.  

Side-note II- I'm seeing my PCP 11/30 for the first time in way too long and I plan on telling him everything I'm going through.  Just looking for anecdotal advice/experience.  Thanks!",3

Been lurking around, posted a couple times about stopping this insidious poisonous.   Everyday trying to quit or taper or take less, everyday failing.   

I am a former opiate addict and started taking this stuff to help with debilitating depression.   And it helped.   For a week.   Now it has me trapped taking more and more each day.   I have attempted to go about stopping without telling anybody.   

I get to the 12 hour mark and my mind finds a way to trick me into “one more day”.   For me it is as powerful as harder opiates when it comes to stopping.   The withdrawls haven’t even kicked in yet at the 12 hr mark and not too worried about the physical aspect of kicking it.   In the past I have had good mental attitudes and always told myself I wasn’t sick or withdrawing but rather I am getting well and healthy and that makes a huge difference for me.  

I am rambling.  Needed somewhere to get this out and ask for help, encouragement, etc.   this life has been such a dark life I don’t understand it and often am begging the question—what’s the point, why are we even here?...... to suffer, live in darkness.    There has to be a better way to live.  

Thanks for this space to write out what I am truly feeling.   If those around me truly knew what went through this head of mine I fear they would lock me up and throw away the key.",8

Here’s the kicker...

Currently a 6 month wait in the health system I’m in right now. Doc said she would call around to other psychiatrists outside their health system to see if I could get in sooner but I have yet to hear back.

I want this so bad.,It’s interesting I only picked up Kratom again in May after I stopped taking my ADHD meds. I was off Kratom for several years and didn’t realize that the withdrawal I felt coming off my other meds was actually from the Kratom. Now here I am resetting my sober clocks every night. I’ve gotten about 36 hours clean in my recent attempts and then go buy extracts. The shame I feel from letting this “energy pick me up” that spiraled into a full blown addiction is unreal. I successfully stopped smoking weed after like 16 years about 2 months ago. I find myself struggling with one thing. This stupid shit. It has not only robbed my of money...but my ability to be transparent..about this one thing. And my ability to feel energy and motivation all by myself. I know it’s a lie. I know because I know who I am without this stuff and I love that girl. She is exactly who I want to be. Any encouragement would be appreciated. I don’t want to go on and on about myself but I have overcome and handled A LOT in my life and I know what the fuck I’m capable of. I guess the withdrawal process scares me but I know it’s inevitable. It’s necessary. And somehow posting this makes me feel like I’m one step closer to putting this shit behind me.

I've lurked on the reddit for the last few days trying to gain knowledge of others' experiences and to prepare what might be ahead of me. Here is my kratom history.

I had kratom on-hand for about 2 years before really trying it consistently. I had gotten it previously after it was recommended to me when I was suffering from extreme nerve pain from a very random health illness at the end of summer 2018. I only tried it once then and never tried again. Fast forward. During quarantine, my (then) girlfriend and I watched a show that covered kratom. I had some. We got curious. We tried it for the first time in April/May. It would give us a sense of focus. We'd take 3 or so grams, put on some meditation/chill out music, and vibe out on whatever activity felt enjoyable (reading, studying, research, floating around on the internet, etc). We would do this every few days, very casually. Over time, I found myself firing off an extra dose of kratom during the days we'd take it, but then I'd give myself a break for a couple days. Once we stopped quarantining together, permanently, around July, I found myself taking kratom almost every day. Sometimes just one 4 gram dose and sometimes a couple of those in a day. Never thought kratom was ""bad"" at that point. What I got from it was a sense of focus... which I struggle with. I'm constantly distracted and it helped me. It also would elevate my mood.

Fast forward to the end of August, my girlfriend and I broke up. We were absolutely each other's best friend. Like, life partner best friend. The person I was quite sure I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Without going into it, the breakup hit hard for both of us. I was hoping it'd work out because we both talked after the breakup that there was only one area of our relationship that really suffered and there were far more tools we didn't use at our disposal to try to improve it. However, just 6 days after we broke up, she told me she was moving to another state. All my hope and what I wanted to propose to her that we try to resecure the relationship went OUT THE WINDOW. It screwed me up big time. I felt I would lose her love forever at that point. I took the high road and just tried to support her and her happiness. Acted like all was ok. It wasn't. But I didn't want to get in the way of her move so I didn't say anything. I still love her deeply and we have, in fact, recently started to communicate on a daily basis in a very adult way. I do get a sense that she still deeply cares for me as I do her. However, to cope with how heavy this hit me during this period of time, I started taking kratom more. On average, I'd take about 4-5g per dose (2 even teaspoons), usually dosing between 3 and 5 times a day. So max 25gpd. That went on from early September until just a few days ago. I started dosing only between 4-10gpd toward the end of last week. Within the last couple weeks, I really started noticing when I don't take it I feel depressed, anxious, I have weird temperature changes with my body, difficulty sleeping. When I do take it, all those things are resolved. I acknowledge this crosses a line with me and I'm absolutely against it. Overall, as a recap, I casually took kratom for an initial 4 months at 3-10gpd, with days off in between. For the last 2.5 months it's been between 15-25gpd.

So after careful studying of posts here, I'm taking the plunge and decided to do it CT. I don't know if that's the wrong decision or if I should try to taper down. Nonetheless, I last took kratom 26+ hours ago (6pm on 11/15/2020). Today, I've felt anxious and have definitely felt down/in a funk. Physical symptoms have been getting hot quickly and then back to cold. Not looking forward to what I've read of all the withdrawals but hopefully the worst of it is over by end of the week.

So yup, there's my story and here's the start of my journey away from kratom. I welcome any advice, any experiences that you can share that might compare to my own that might help me, or anything that helped you a lot with any withdrawals. Does anyone have any short bouts with kratom like me at the same dosage? How was your experience after cutting the cord? The withdrawal I'm mostly concerned about is not sleeping, it's already affected me a lot.

Cheers all, and many thanks to all of you on this reddit. I appreciated reading every story I came across. My heart and sincerity is with every one of you.",3
2020-11-16 21:51:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jvl4av/one_month_down/,One month down!,"Just realised I’ve passed the one month mark since quitting CT! Things seem to be stabilising now, although after the couple shitty depressed days I had last week I’m reminded I’m not out of the woods yet. Still just taking things one day at a time.

One big positive is that I got offered a job position after what I thought was a pretty mediocre interview last week. Certainly not a dream job by any stretch of the imagination but it’s full time work. Something I have realised the last couple weeks that I really needed. Not just for the money, but to keep me occupied until going back to uni next February. And just getting the offer has been a big confidence boost.

My urges for kratom are definitely receding. I still think about it when I get bored, but I’m hoping work will keep me busy enough not to think about it. I had a couple days last week where I had quite a few alcoholic drinks in the evening, but after a killer hangover I think I just prefer to stay sober now. I’ve also cut weed out again too for the last few days.

Apologies for the big ramble, it’s really nice to actually be feeling some REAL happiness and I just had to share. If you’re in the middle of acutes or about to start a quit or taper, just know you’re really making a wise decision. I’m so happy I’ve gotten off kratom. Life is too short to be living in an emotionless haze. Peace!!",7

This was all before I quit. 

When we first stopped, my heart rate went to normal and was amazing not noticing my heart rate all day long being able to stand and it not pound out of my chest.  But starting day 10 it started to speed up again  on and off and now today it’s really going fast and I can feel it. 

The first 4-5 days were a breeze, I felt cold sweats I was so tired, runny nose, sneezing, but I felt good like accomplished with each day and I had a boost of energy around day 5-6.  Starting day 7/8 my restless legs got worse, my stomach didn’t start to hurt until days 9-13 and I have this odd icy hot flash sensation through my whole body, I feel cold constantly, but I’m sweating a lot, why am I having such intense lingering physical symptoms? Is this common can anyone assure me this is from the withdraw still and I didn’t ruin my body or brain? I know that might sound crazy but today’s day 13 and it was probably one of the hardest days for me physically. 

Thanks in advance for any advice or encouragement!",7

It sounds like a trivial statement, because obviously I’ve been myself the whole time, but it’s really the greatest gift in the world.

For the last 3-4 years I’ve felt that a part of me was missing—some indescribable part of me that I could never really identify or explain.  I felt like I was constantly searching for something that I used to have, trying to return to some previous state of consciousness that I was certain existed even though I couldn’t remember what it felt like.  I still had all the same likes and dislikes, the same personality, and I was able to pretty much go about my day without anyone noticing anything wrong with me.  But I knew something was missing.

It’s hard to describe what I’ve felt like for the last few years.  I lot of people on this forum say that kratom turned them into a zombie, and I kind of get that.  At times I’ve described it as being in a fog.  I think it involved some level of derealization/depersonalization/dissociation, but not in a full-blown clinical psychology kind of way.  Just this ever present, nagging feeling that I wasn’t experiencing the *full* reality of everything around me.  Like the volume on life was turned down.  It felt like there was a window shield between me and the world, and all of my sensations, emotions, and thoughts were only accessible to me through this invisible barrier.

At times it felt like my body was just operating on autopilot (including complicated tasks like talking to people and doing work) but my conscious mind had no real say in what happened.  I remember watching my hands take the jar of kratom out of the cabinet and spoon a dose into my dedicated kratom cup and mix it with water all while thinking “I don’t want to do this” but then the body would raise the cup to my mouth and down it would go.

A journal entry from 5/31/18 reads: “I feel like a shadow.  I feel hollow.  I feel like an empty husk.  It’s horrible.  I’m all gone.”

But that’s starting to change.  Today, I feel more like “myself” than I have in ages.  I feel like I am inhabiting my body again.  I feel like I have agency.  I’d still say I’m not 100% there, but at least I have hope.  Some days are better than others—it’s definitely not been linear—but the general trend since I quit is indisputably upward.

I’m a little embarrassed by how long it took me to figure out that the kratom was to blame, but I don’t even really care about that now.  I’m just so happy and relieved to be back.  It feels like coming down from the longest and most boring drug trip imaginable, which I guess is exactly what it is.

If you are feeling this way and considering quitting, *do it*.  It’s not easy, but it’s so worth it.

To all my fellow quitters: Welcome back to planet earth.  It’s beautiful here.",30

It felt good to get out of the house and be around people again but the day crawled by and I couldn’t focus on anything. I keep telling myself that I feel the way I feel because my brain is sick and needs to relearn how to function every day. Just like when I had ACL surgery and had to go to PT to build strength back, I need to practice strategies to help me exist in my life without kratom. I’m trying to focus on the here and now and be ok with not being at my best. Knowing that I’m not going to kill it at work or anywhere else is making me feel super vulnerable, but it’s also kind of freeing to not give a shit about anything right now except getting healthy. Letting go of worrying about things that don’t really matter is an act of kindness that we don’t often give ourselves, but we have to if quitting is going to work. Nothing else matters except healing, and that’s where all my energy is going. I hate that I messed with my brain chemistry so profoundly that the littlest things cause anxiety and dread, but this is where I am right now. I know that it’s temporary and what I need to do to get through it. Just keep getting through the hours, the days, the weeks and eventually I hope to recognize myself again.",7

2020-11-16 18:27:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jvhtc6/i_need_someone_to_tell_me_that_it_wont/,I need someone to tell me that it won't necessarily take 6 months to get back to normal,"I've been using kratom for about 3 years, on and off with bouts of using suboxone and tianeptine sprinkled in. All self-medication. Right now it's just kratom. Highest usage was about 32 GPD, but more recently, my daily average was around 17-20 GPD. Yesterday I took 5 grams and today I'm not taking any. I really want to actually kick this shit this time; I kicked it last fall, but I was also taking high doses of phenibut every day at that point. I'm no longer taking phenibut but I've been using lyrica over the last week to help taper quickly without the RLS. (I know I'm playing with fire again, but I only took half of a lyrica yesterday with no ill effects, and I don't enjoy it enough to want to keep using it after I run out.) 

Anyway, my main issue is that most of what I see in this sub is people saying that it takes about 6 months to get over the PAWS. That's fucking bleak as shit, man. I don't know if I can do it. Kratom has never seriously impacted my life, other than my hair thinning and me spending a little more than I'd like. I mostly just want off of it for the sake of not being dependent on it. But goddamn, 6 months is a long time to feel like this. Is that really standard, or does it depend on the person? And those of you who have been through this, what did you do to deal with the PAWS? Acute opioid WDs aren't new to me; I've dealt with coming off of oxy, subs, and very high-dose tianeptine, with and without kratom. I can deal with feeling run down for a week or so. But half a year of cravings, anhedonia, depression, and boredom, while I simultaneously try to quit smoking weed? I'm gonna end up fucking suicidal.

Thanks in advance.

After having suicidal thoughts on a daily basis for a time, 5 months ago I ""tricked"" myself into jumping from 3 GPD after tapering for 7 weeks and thankfully haven't looked back since by hard work and determination. This sub is vital to me staying quit.

Today at 4pm was 150 days since I've ingested kratom. I've been an active member and contributor (hopefully) to this sub ever since. Not different from many people here, I knew about this sub while I was using, BUT was afraid to even just lurk here. I literally ""took a peak"" at this sub a couple times, got afraid of what I saw and would immediately click-off. Deep down inside I probably new that if I did browse around this sub for any length of time, I'd read the truth. I still wanted to live in denial and continue using.

I never tried any other opiates or hard drugs in my lifetime and started using kratom for ""self-diagnosed"" depression and anxiety, or so I told myself. The truth is, I quit drinking in 1993, and after 23+ years of physical sobriety I just wanted a mental escape to get ""outside of myself"". That became a 3+ year journey down a dark road, that we're all familiar with.

I started developing chronic back pain about mid-way through the length of my addiction... to the point where many a night or morning I couldn't get out of bed and once I finally did it took everything I could do to straighten up and walk to the bathroom. Those were scary times. Since I never suffered an injury to my back, it took quite a while for me to put two and two together and realize that *maybe kratom is a contributor*, if not the cause, of this often debilitating back pain. (I even called out of work because of it a couple times, and I've always been the type of person that dragged my tail into work no matter what.) But this new pain gave me an excuse to continue using kratom... even when it ""stopped working"" for me.

I began trying to taper somewhere around my 2 year usage mark... probably before that. I can't honestly say if I was attempting to taper to eventually quit or to just take a break to see if it was genuinely kratom that was causing my back issues. (It was probably the latter, if I'm honest with myself. I was living in such a fog that I often couldn't differentiate between the truth or a lie.) I'd make a taper plan for myself and have brief success for a time, but would always find an EXCUSE to spike back up again. This became a vicious cycle of decreases, increases, decreases, increases and on and on and on. 

Finally the pain (physical AND mental) became so great that I began waking up every morning wishing I hadn't. I would try to think of ways to commit suicide. I figured this was it for me and the ""premonition"" I had in my early 20s that I wasn't going to live long enough to see my 50th birthday would indeed come true, whether it be due to outside circumstances or at my own hands.

I decided to taper again in late April / early May of this year. (CT scared me too much at the time.) Luckily I had always kept a journal during my kratom addiction, tracking my usage and results. (I continue to keep a journal to this day, but now I track my progress in quitting and staying quit as well as daily activities and thoughts.) I probably did many things ""wrong"" during my final taper attempt. I didn't really utilize this sub until I jumped and actually quit. I honestly don't know why. I probably still believed I would never be able to quit for good and all, so why bother. Or maybe, deep down, I really didn't want to quit. But I knew I NEEDED to quit.

I tapered for 7 weeks, with no real plan beforehand. I just knew I needed to get off of this stuff. During those 7 weeks I found excuses a handful of times to take more than I should. But one smart thing I actually did was make sure I dropped 1g from where I was previously from before the day(s) I spiked up. BY NO MEANS IS THIS THE WAY TO TAPER, but it's what I did without the [education of this subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/7p0qx2/read_this_first_if_youre_new/). 

10 days before I ultimately jumped and quit I was able to get down to one dose per day. (I'd been up to 5 or 6 times per day at the height of my addiction. I started my taper at 4 times per day. Ya' see, I was dropping frequency of doses rather than the amounts of each dose. Somehow this ultimately worked for me, BUT I still always recommend [tapering how this subreddit suggests](https://www.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/).) 

Something truly magically happened for me the first time I successfully got through the day with only dosing once. The next day I had the realization: ""Hey, I can actually get through 24 hours without using kratom!"" **This gave me great hope!** Hope that I hadn't seen in a long LONG time. I was down to 6 GPD at this point and proceeded to taper more rapidly over the next 10 days, not really knowing that that tenth day would actually be my last. The day I got down to 3 grams I wrote in my journal ""See if I can skip my daily dose today."" (I was dosing at 4pm daily by this point. Acute withdrawals started the last week of my taper. I trudged through the runny nose, constant sneezing, chills, aches and pains, etc. every morning. Usually by Noon I'd feel a bit better. I dosed at 4pm every day in hopes of sleeping at night and hoping to ward off my chronic back pain which always peaked early evening... around 5pm.)

Friday, June 19th ended up being the last time I ingested kratom. I hadn't planned it to be. Ya' see, I kinda' tricked myself into quitting when I did. Or ""Fate"" did. Something did. Saturday morning, June 20th I wrote in my journal, ""Maybe try not to dose today at 4pm and see what happens... depending on how my back pain is."" Somewhere around 3pm that afternoon I laid down to take a nap. (Naps longer than 10 minutes were nonexistent at this point. I was already suffering from insomnia at night and hadn't slept for more than 2-3 hours broken up per night that entire week as the result of withdrawals.) I would have guaranteed that I'd be awake to take my 4pm daily dose and was probably planning to do it, despite what I wrote in my journal that morning. Well, I didn't wake up until nearly 7pm. THAT WAS 27 HOURS SINCE I'D LAST TAKEN KRATOM! I was skocked! I couldn't believe I ""overslept"" and I couldn't believe I'd went that long without kratom. I quickly ""diagnosed"" myself. I didn't feel too bad. I was amazed by that as well. I said to myself, ""Hell, if I can make it 27 hours, I can make it 48.... 72.... maybe 96?? THAT'S IT! I'M DONE!""

I haven't looked back since. It did take a couple weeks for me to be convinced that ""I DON'T EVER WANT TO USE THAT STUFF AGAIN... EVER!!!"" I started looking more into this sub and after a few days become a regular submitter / contributor. Physical acute withdrawals peeked between day 3 and 4. Day 2 was probably my ""pink cloud"" period.

To this day, I still have a hard time determining when acutes subsided and when my first round of PAWS began. For me, they kinda' collided with each other. The worst part of withdrawals for me was insomnia (I had about 3 nights of RLS and restless arms) and back pain (but I don't think I can blame that on withdrawals... unless there were additional aches and pains caused by WD on top of what I was normally experiencing for the past year anyway). The strongest thing I used to combat the symptoms was Ibuprofen and smokable CBD flower. Both helped with pain, but did very little for sleep. I ended up not having a decent night sleep for a month (last week of tapering and first three weeks of quitting). Sleep, for me, is still hit or miss till this day. But somewhere along the line I accepted that ""I guess I'm just not going to sleep well for a while."" I get up when I can't sleep and attempt to quietly do something productive. Sleep is better for me lately, but I still have the occasional night where I only get three hours sleep, or like this past Saturday night, absolutely none at all. But those zero sleep nights are very rare. Usually, I'm grateful for whatever sleep I get.

My second round of PAWS hit hard between 40-50 days... during a week long blackout caused by a bad storm in my area. I possibly hit another round of PAWS a few weeks ago, but it was nothing compared to the first or second time. I slacked a bit on my daily routine of exercising and cold showers (so that could have contributed to the PAWS-like symptoms) but thankfully got back on track a couple weeks ago. 

One thing I've never slacked on, thankfully, is practicing Wim Hof Method breathing exercises. Since my second week of quitting I've performed WHM breathing AT LEAST once a day... it's how I like to start my day.

Somewhere along the line **I've become determined to STAY QUIT**. I'm passionate about it. Reading about others on the sub being determined to quit and stay quit feeds my passion.

I've used the Daily Check-In Thread on this sub since very early on in my quit. I truly believe it's a way that helps me and others remain accountable. It's also a great way for newcomers to meet other active regulars of this sub. To watch others grow from ""Day 1"" continues to be inspiring to me. I've also seen a bunch of folks ""fall by the wayside"". That's sad, but it's unfortunately the nature of the situation we deal with here. Sometimes I message those folks to see if they're ok. Sometimes they respond, sometimes they don't. All we, as a sub, can do is make sure this sub remains a safe and supportive place for those people to return to when they're ready.

I generally try not to write books like this because I realize everyone's time, including mine, is valuable. I read every post that comes through this sub. I always learn something. I hope I always keep learning and growing.

Thank you QK subreddit for helping me get my life back. Is life perfect? Of course not. Have I now somehow become perfect because I quit kratom? No, far from it. **But I don't use kratom no matter what.** I don't even entertain those sneaky thoughts that sometimes creep into my addict brain. I recognize them for what they are: a LIE. I replace the lie with the TRUTH and then attempt to do something productive. If I can be helpful to someone else, expecting nothing in return, that helps me stay clean too.

I'm living proof that you CAN get free of this demon. Unfortunately, most folks struggle for quite some time. That's just the reality of our addiction... addiction in general, I suppose. Keep in mind that I failed at tapering for over a year. Everyone has their own journey. This journey is rarely easy. But if we're determined, patient and diligent, **QUITTING KRATOM and STAYING QUIT IS POSSIBLE!** Find what works for you and go for it. You CAN do this!",27

My hair is falling out, I sweat all the time and literally feel like death. It’s like I can feel the damage it’s doing inside me. I don’t even get high anymore I just continue doing it hoping I’ll feel something.

I completely told him everything because I want help! I’ve spent so much of his money. That’s what Addicts do best lie and sneak around. I hate myself so much I have prayed for death because I can’t kill myself. I don’t feel genuine emotion anymore. Since starting to taper down the depression is eating me up.

A little bit of back story.  I got on Kratom about 2.5 years ago as an aid to help me study and stay motivated for my board exams.  I was tricked into the fallacy that Kratom was a harmless herbal supplement.  For the first few months it was magical.  It would help me focus it would last 6 hours and made me a productive happy beast.  

Quickly 1 dose per day became 2 doses per day then 3 doses per day.  I was done with my board exams but I found it hard to stop.  This went on for 2 more years when I decided it was destroying my life.  The first red flag was the anhedonia.  I was no longer enjoying what I was doing.  The second red flag was my general numbness in life I was no longer motivated to do things that would advance my career, I was living life going through the motions seeing patients and waiting for my next dose.  The third red flag was going to see the doctor to see what the F was going on with me.  I've gone into details on previous posts but long story short.  My sex hormones were completely out of balance and I had adrenal fatigue and thyroid issues.  I tried to stop at that point but then I realized I had become dependant.  At this point I knew I was in for a ride.  

I tried to stop for the next few months only to find an excuse not to.  About 3 months ago I decided that it was either my future and living to my potential or to be a drug addict for the rest of my life.  I went on a very long taper then jumped 43 days ago.   

The first few weeks were rough.  There were days I just wanted to lay in bed and suffer motionless.  That wasn't the worst part though.  The worst part was and still is the lingering PAWS, demotivation, anhedonia, laziness, poor mood, depression.  I thought It was never going to end, but I never lost hope.  

I can say at day 43 things are much better but I still can't say things are 100 percent.  I'm starting to gain some of my energy back.  I am slowly taking actions to improve my life, career, and physical well being. I am somewhat still depressed but it isn't debilitating like it was the first 2 weeks of my quit.  I can only hope things will get better as time passes.  

I have alot of experience with patients that can become dependant on opioid pain medications as I prescribe them multiple times every day.  I explain to them the risks of addiction and generally I limit my scripts to them to about 2 weeks before having a long and hard discussion.  If I would have known Kratom would do the same to me I would have had that same discussion with myself and never let myself get into a place where I was.   

If there is anything positive I could learn from this I now have a better understanding of the mechanisms of opioid addiction and how difficult and debilitating it can be.  I also understand the danger of one sided information as I am a trained health professional and I was led to believe that Kratom was harmless.  This is very very far from the truth.  It has a very similar addiction potential to traditional opiates.   The AKA, kratom forums, pro kratom social media is doing the public a disservice by not telling the whole story.  While kratom can be used as a tool to get people off of more deadly drugs it is not a harmless tool. It has the potential to slowly and innocuously destroy someone's life and slowly suck the joy out of your life, like a little green leech, without you noticing until it is too late.",21

Wanted to discuss possible ADHD and what if anything we can do to verify/treat the symptoms.

She was going to call around to other psychiatrists to try and get me seen sooner but I’m not getting my hopes up. 

For the time being going to have to do my best to manage my extreme restlessness and lack of focus, making work less than ideal. 

To be clear, these symptoms are not something that only popped up after my recent quit but are something I’ve dealt with my entire adult life - and I’ve always sought out substances to ease the restlessness and help me focus. Instead of self medicating though, trying to work through potential causes and come up with a healthier, long term solution.",5

2020-11-16 10:27:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jv8mkr/trying_to_get_my_life_back/,Trying to get my life back,"First of all I want to thank everyone who has bared their souls in this forum which has been invaluable in realizing I'm not alone and helped me finally admit I'm an addict and my kratom is my master.

Never in my wildest nightmares did I think I'd be at the mercy of a plant-based powder that I began using for back pain eight years ago, but here I am eight years later begging and pleading with myself to quit living the lie that's on the brink of ruining my life.

I've not gone a single day since late 2012 without kratom. That's roughly 3,000 straight days where kratom has been in the forefront of my life which seems inconceivable but alas, it's the sad and bitter truth.

I've have had chronic lower back pain for 30 years and took Ibuprofen to manage the pain with sporadic success. Upon discovering kratom, I thought I'd found the perfect way to cope with the pain but little did I know it has every bit the addictive potential as the opiates I always tried to avoid.

I began taking around 2 grams per day but slowly graduated to 5 grams per day and that's the dosage level I've been a slave to for at least the last two years.  After reading numerous posts on this forum, I realize that's a relatively small daily dose but no matter the dose, it has a stranglehold on my life and I have to get off it before I hit the point of no return.

I've told an unending series of lies to friends and family to camouflage my daily use. My deception has fooled everyone but is eating me alive emotionally as I pride myself on honesty and integrity. 

Three days ago I decided to take the massively scary plunge and go cold turkey because I didn't think I had the patience to endure the several week, or possibly several month hell of extended withdrawal. I can honestly say the last 72 hours were the worst of my life and I've had my share of hardships during   my six decades.

Just two hours ago while lying in bed with debilitating restlessness and crippling sadness, on the heels of almost no sleep for three days, I surrendered and dipped back into the kratom. I wouldn't wish those 72 hours on my worst enemy. The headaches, RLS and overall restlessness were horrible but even worse was the anxiety and dread that I couldn't turn off no matter how hard I tried.  For the first time in my life, I had complete clarity on how people reach the point of suicide which scared me to my core.

I feel like it's now or never to get my life back, hence my writing this post to ask for support and advice from those of you who have dealt with, or are dealing with this crippling situation.

After reading about several tapering options, the taper I hope and pray will work for me is as follows:

* Week #1 - Begin today with my baseline of 5 gpd and by day # 7 have tapered down to 4 gpd.
* Week #2 - Begin with 4 gpd and by day # 7 have tapered down to 3 gpd.
* Week #3 - Begin with 3 gpd and by day # 7 have tapered down to 2 gpd.
* Week #4 - Begin with 2 gpd and by day # 7 have tapered down to 1 gpd.
* Week #5 - Begin with 1 gpd and by day # 7 have tapered down to never using it again.

During the five weeks I'd dose 3-4 times a day to hopefully help ease the withdrawal. Later today I plan on buying magnesium citrate, L-theanine and melatonin.

I'd appreciate input on the above tapering approach and any other advice or experience anyone would like to share with me.  I realize there's not a 1-size-fits-all tapering approach but am hoping this one will work for me. 

Again my sincere thanks to all of you. 

Sincerely,

Trying to get my life back",13

Does this come from quitting Kratom? I consumed 3-4x 3-4gpd for maybe 1 1/2 months only. I suffer from depression and social anxiety. Maybe it‘s just backfiring of my now more present depression as I don‘t consume kratom anymore and I feel the symptoms more. Probably also psychosomatic?",2

I just felt like total crap with lethargy and depression.  I also have cravings every day.  This is the first time I’ve tried to quit and I’m only 2 weeks in so I’m looking at it as still a learning experience.  My first week seemed pretty easy.  I think I reached my baseline though.  I kept dropping and seemed to hit a point where further drops have a significant impact.  Yesterday I was able to convince myself that it was ok to get some temp relief and then get back at it.  Today I’m not so sure.  I don’t have much in the way of physical issues, but the mental is tough.  I’m exercising every day, trying to eat clean, multivitamin, and magnesium.  I’m gonna try small doses of weed to help with the mental side.  A friend is making me some edibles.  I’m going back to the doses I had on Friday and will hold there a couple days.  Then I’ll drop 1g and do that for 2 days and then drop 1g, etc.  I’ll try that system for a while and see how it works.  I was dropping 2gpd every day and I think that worked until I hit 33gpd (down from 70 in 1.5 weeks).  I’m thinking that maybe I just had to figure out where that threshold was.  I also know o need to embrace the suck, but damn that’s hard when you know relief is in the next room.  

At this point I’m wondering if I’ll end up having to CT, but I’m not ready to make that call yet.  Anyway, I feel like posting here gives me some accountability so thanks for being here.",3
2020-11-16 06:20:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jv55tg/28_days_review/,28 Days Review,"I've been reading these posts for some time now and rather than just be a spectator I figured it was time to give back and hopefully help others in their journeys. This morning marks day 28 now of stopping Kratom CT. 

I started about 13 months ago taking one dose each day for about a month before one random Sunday adding the 2nd dose, quickly from there 2 became 3,4,5,6 a day, and to the point of starting each morning at 4am with my first. A few months back I began to notice ""random"" headaches beginning around 9am and disappearing around noon or so. This went on for 2 weeks before they stopped going away. On week 3 of the headaches, trying to subtract various things out of my diet, routine, etc...I stopped Kratom CT for 48 hours and because at this point the headaches were worse now, at first I believed that it must be something else since taking it or not, headaches still existed. Obviously that wasn't the case and after 48 hours I took 1 more dose and felt slightly better but only for about 30 minutes. 

At that point it hit me, Kratom was giving me the headaches while taking it, and when stopping for those 48 hours, I was experiencing the withdrawal. Arguing with myself for a day, I made what's the worse of two evils decision so 28 days ago I completely stopped. 

For the first 5 days, I experienced horrible RLS, A consistent headache that rendered me pretty much useless to anyone. I essentially laid in bed for 14 hours a day, twitching and laying in odd places around the house etc... By about Day 6 I noticed the headache slightly manageable but still consistent, this went on for another 48 hours or so before pain turned into just a sense of annoyance. By day 8, with the help of some PM medicine, I managed to finally get a decent sleep and haven't had RLS since. Headaches ceased as well. 

For me at least, after the first 7 days or so, I knew I was physically past the worst of it and had no temptation to take another dose while my body was trying to normalize itself. For about the last 3 weeks now the only remaining symptom I haven't been able to overcome is a consistent fatigue from about noon through the evening. Because of the numerous posts on here I do know that this for some is part of the process and will soon come to pass as well. 

If I were to summarize my experience, I would just say for me although I knew before I quit that it was getting to a point where it was a secret huge problem, it took honesty to myself that the road I was going was all due to my decision to start with and thus was also within me to choose when enough was enough. 

Thanks to everyone for sharing your stories and letting me share mine.",31

1. Quit nicotine weeks BEFORE you quit kratom
2. Quit Caffeine weeks BEFORE you quit kratom
3. Lower alcohol use/abstain weeks BEFORE you quit kratom
4. Begin taking supplements about a week or two before quitting kratom (magnesium, vitamin C/D, fiber, probiotic, fish oil, multivitamin) 
4. Start Wim Hof breathing exercises/cold showers right after quitting
5. Begin exercising right after quitting

I struggled immensely with dopamine irregularities after quitting. Drinking on weekends set me back to day 5 WD over and over. My brain associated caffeine and nicotine and alchohol with kratom. These things also exasterbated my RLS over and over. I wish I would have known what I was in for. These things probably made my kratom withdrawal 10x worse than it had to be. Your kratom rewired brain doesn't know how to handle these other substances after you abstain from kratom and it can have your brain screaming for more dopamine shortly after using caffeine/nicotine/alcohol.",14

I’m sharing my story that happened five days ago..
I’ve been taking Kratom for about two years. I do the powder, maeng da, probably around 10-20 gpd. I take it about four to five times a day. I’m fairly healthy and love exercising, walking my dog, jogging and being pretty active. And I unexpectedly had a full Tonic-clonic (Grand Mal) seizure at work and woke up in the hospital. Nothing like this has EVER happened to me before. Doctor told me that Kratom has a huge effect on the brain and this could have been partly the reason I had this seizure out of no where. I had not sleep barely at all the night before this happened so I’m guessing that’s what brought it all on. All my testing (CT scan and EEG) came back clean. Thank GOD. Anyway. It was definitely enough to make me want to quit Kratom forever.
Im now on anti seizure medication and anti anxiety meds to help me sleep(which are not really working btw) I’m living on edge every day so scared that i am going to have another seizure. I’m on day four right now of no Kratom and I am in so much pain. My whole back kills, I have RLS and insomnia and pretty much have no motivation to do much of anything. Not sure how much pain i can blame on the actual seizure and how much is from the withdrawal. Never did I realize a “natural” substance could have such a negative effect on my body.
This is my first time posting. Please anyone feel free to give me any tips or positive advice to help me get through this tough time. And I’d be happy to hear if anyone has any symptoms like this or is going/gone through anything similar? Thanks! ❤️",19

Ive been wondering for a while if it is the kratom causing a lot of the problems and not the actual withdrawl. Ive even had some health problems lately. I feel kratom has contributed. All that plant matter in the body constantly has got to have some effect. So I dunno what to expect. Thinking about cold turkeying once and for all.

The wd process has been a real struggle to say the least. The first 4 days i had off work(work in a busy busy breakfast restaurant) returned on day 5 for a 630-230 shit and felt like i was dying all day but pushed through. I have been working those shifts for the last 5 days on 2-4 hours of sleep, trust me when i say it was hell but if you have the right mindset you can do this. You jusy need a really good reason, for me it was my wife getting pregnant with our second child it gives me that push that i needed when i was already done with it i hated dosing when i was on it.

Ive been trying to quit for a year and a half now failed multiple ct attempt from 80-100gpd and failed so many tapers so i forced myslef and  tapered down to 30 and failed my taper and my doses grew again and before i knew it i was dosing every 3 hours 10-15 gs a time. Not fun but so worth it for a better life, and i can be the man my family needs instead of a hollowed out husk of myself.

If you are in the early days of quit and are questioning your ability to do it beleive me when i say you can do this. If i can you can i did it while working 6am -2 pm ct 60-80gpd and come home and chase a toddler around while still trying to be there for your family. Today day 10 is my first day off since day 5 and i feel good got 7 hours of sleep last night, 4 hour and 3 hour stretch with 2 hours up at 12-2 am so thats a big improvement.  Obviously im experiencing PAWS and the anxiety and depression get really bad sometimes but when that happens i just take a hit off a cbd vape and it helps immensly. Im hoping i can keep this attitude through the rest of my wd it really hasnt been as bad as i thought but still worst in some ways. I will keep chugging away and before i know it ill be at a year! 

We can do this, one day at a time and embrace the suck it will be so much better when we are over this hump. Whats 1 month of feeling shitty for years of a healthy sober life!

Sure, the thought of using comes to mind here and there, but it rarely persists.

Exercising for about 45-60 minutes most days.  Telling my friends and family what I'm going through has been very helpful too.  That adds some accountability to this.  My fiancé, and our relationship is a huge motivator for me too.  I know that by staying clean, I can give her, our relationship, and our future my best.  Bottom line I just feel so much better off the sludge.  My ability to think has improved vastly over this quit.  I'm a grad student in mechanical engineering, and the sludge did not make life in school any easier.

This morning I woke up feeling extremely fatigued, but was able to go on a bike ride with my dad. Nothing crazy, and I didn't overdo it. It felt good.

Within the last hour, it's almost like I'm back to day 1-3. I'm clammy, my whole body feels like it's on fire, every muscle aches unbearably, it hurts to keep my eyes open but I can't fall asleep. Bad rls.

The only difference is I don't have wicked nausea and I'm not throwing up.

I've read and spoke to people who said this isn't linear, and that's clearly the case. I just didn't expect to feel like this, again. 

I have what I consider to be a pretty high pain tolerance, and honestly this is a bitch. I was at about 50-75 gpd (depending on the day) for 4 years (extract shots) so no I didn't expect this to be a walk in the park, but damn.

Has anyone experienced similar setbacks? 

I could use some encouragement. 

One upside I must share though: through all of this pain, it feels mentally so good to clearheaded for the first time in years.

Kratom is a crutch for me, I use it to cope with stress, anxiety, depression, and to help me focus. But I know that taking it every day is not good for me and I want to stop before it keeps getting worse. I know it has a negative effect on libido and testosterone production so I definitely don't want this to be long term.

So far, I have used almost every day for about 2 years. I have taken tolerance breaks of 4 days to a week. But I keep going back to using every day. 

I am seeing a therapist for other reasons, but perhaps he can help me overcome this as well if I bring it up more in sessions? He knows of my use, but I think I need to be more upfront about it in order to stop.

What are some ways I can deal with withdrawals? I have heard Weed helps a lot with the physical part of it. I still need to overcome cravings and the feeling that I am ""missing something"".

If something was too hard, take kratom. Was I feeling tired? - take some kratom. I now realize the habit I formed made me act just like Maslow’s dog. A difficult task was my bell, kratom was my food, and my desire to consume kratom was my salivation. 

I tried to quit twice, but I could never find my “Why.” 

Two weeks ago, my wife told me she was pregnant. It occurred to me that I want to feel everything a father should feel - All the joy and pain. So that’s my “Why,” the reason I’m quitting. I think about it all the time, and it’s one thing that helps me through. 

As far as symptoms are concerned, the physical ones are over (ended around day 5). But the mental ones are debilitating. I’m struggling with listlessness, anxiety, and the like.

I have a fixer-upper house, and in the middle of this pandemic, to have such little energy feels like a waste. My now pregnant wife is pulling her weight, getting things organized, and I’m struggling to finish the sheetrock in our entryway. 

My wife doesn’t understand where I am with this. She’s upset I even got started with Kratom, so she doesn’t have much sympathy for my current state.

I have been using Kratom on and off for about 6 years but did not become completely hooked until about 10 months ago. I have an addictive personality and for the most part, alcohol has been where I have turned to since I was about 12 years old. Fortunately, I was able to quit alcohol about two years ago and have been able to stay away from it since. The bad part is that I have continuously traded the habit for one thing after another, Kratom being one of them.

Right before I got hooked on it this last time I had fallen into a depression. I was tired of being in that state of mind and I knew that Kratom had helped me in the past. So I started taking it and soon after all emotions were becoming numb. I loved it and I still do. I am terrified to feel again because I know the dark places my mind goes to. But, at the same time, I am ready to feel like a person again. I am ready to quit but it is SO much harder than I realized it would be.

I kept building a tolerance up until I was at about 100g a day. About 3 months ago is when I started trying to cut back and today I am finally at about 2.5-3g a day. My recent cut was 6 days ago and I am starting to feel the withdraws kick in. The night sweats, the achy body, the abnormal body temperatures, the mood swings, and I didn't realize until I read some of the stories on here that runny nose was part of it as well, but that one doesn't bother me that much.

I thought I was ready to make that jump yesterday by putting it down for good but I failed. The pain is so unbearable, both emotionally and physically. I feel like I can do anything I set my mind to but again and again, I am pulled back by these chains.

I am ready to be free, I am ready to be a better mother for my child, and I just want to be me again.

If there is anyone with a similar story that was able to get clean, how did you do it? Where did you find the strength? How did you cope with the withdraws? Is there anything I can do to help with the night sweats? The body aches? The bad temper? And most importantly, how did you deal with all of the emotions that you once felt hit you all at once again?

2020-11-14 16:37:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ju9upa/quitting_kratom_and_caffeine_simultaneously/,Quitting kratom and caffeine simultaneously? (Longer post),"So a bit of background on where I'm at, I've always had an addictive personality and it's gotten me into trouble a few times, but these two relatively benign substances are proving to be quite difficult for me to kick. I have a history of pharmaceutical opioid use, primarily Hydros and Oxys, although where I lived at the time it was difficult to get them on a daily basis. That being said the opioid high always occupied a place in my mind. I also had concerning stints abusing clonazolam and MDMA but neither to the degree that I developed serious physical dependence, but the psychological toll was immense. After that I got into Tianeptine and began using it consistently. This is where things really got out of hand: I'd found a cheap and easy to source substance that exceeded the euphoria of Oxys or MDMA and was (supposedly) safer. I went wild. I lost days to this substance, and for the first time in my life I experienced physical symptoms from withdrawal. After waking up to just how fucked I was I tried and failed for months to break free. The turning point funnily enough was totally unintentional, one day I decided to have an LSD trip for the first time in over a year, and after coming down it was if I had a near total reset. I had a motivation and vitality to power through, and although the following days were difficult, the withdrawal period was immensely easier than my previous attempts. I was also a major caffeine user, something akin to 500-700mg a day, and this experience gave me the push I needed to quit caffeine too. This was difficult in its own way, not because of an accute suffering but because it was a prolonged campaign of malaise and fatigue that took months to get over. But I did it.

Long story short a while later I begin a stressful new position at work and the tianeptine cravings start taking hold of me. I've been using kratom daily for the past 4 months or so as a means to stave off these cravings and so far I've been successful. My job also led to me using caffeine again albeit in a much more controlled manner.

So here's the situation I'm in now: my kratom use I feel has become problematic and is starting to affect my life. I've used kratom for weeks at a time before and upon stopping only had minor symptoms that were over in a day or two, but this time has proven to be much more difficult. The longest I've gotten so far was 2 days, and I started to turn into a total fiend by the end of it. During that time I ordered some tianeptine in my craze and then took some kratom to simmer down. The tianeptine is currently sitting locked away and I haven't touched it since it arrived. My regular caffeine use also exacerbates some of the withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, but the combination of trying to go with no caffeine as well as the slump my kratom use has been leaving me in leaves me a wreck. I've adjusted my work environment where I now work 4 days on and 3 days off. My best streak off kratom was while working as it keeps me occupied, so I think my plan is to try and buckle down with no kratom for my work week and then cut out caffeine and just be a totally useless blob for the next three days. I'm wondering if this is a horrible idea or not, and if anyone else has any advice on how to manage dealing with both these substances together?",3

So 2 months ago I posted in this group about quitting Kratom CT. I am very disappointed in myself because I wasn’t successful. I started taking the shots about 2 years ago. Slowly I became more tolerant and had to take more. I am/was spending $40 a day on shots and I am financially struggling. I’m a nursing student but I work as a nanny for extra money, but it all goes towards Kratom. I was not successful when going cold turkey, but I figured out a new way. I know this is an excuse, but with nursing school, I don’t have time to quit cold turkey because the withdrawals will prevent me from studying and schoolwork. I have decided to never take a shot of it again, and use the powder instead. I still cannot figure out how much to take to start because I never used powder before. For these next few days, I am going to take a specific amount once a day. And every few days, I am going to decrease it by 2 or 3 grams. I tried taking 14 grams and I threw up so it was way too much! If anyone recommends a good amount to start at I would love to know! I am really excited and proud that I have begun the journey towards quitting permanently. I am fed up with Kratom taking over my life and within 2-3 weeks, I hope that I will never touch it again. If anyone has any recommendations on dosages, tapering, and activities/vitamins to help make this a litter easier, feel free to share or message me!

I've been using daily for 6 months or so, my depression I dealt with for years is suffocating now at times, the anxiety is just crippling, if I wake up like I normally do on Saturdays and take half a shot at 6 am , and maybe almost the rest by 1100, I am overwhelmed by negative thoughts bad anxiety and just over all it has been affecting my relationships because it effects me socially. I'm encapsulated, once again.. it sucks because I knew I'd never have to take anything to feel good anymore, I was over that.. but I used it to cope with my feelings because my wife's mother lived with us before she passed ( rest her soul) and she had alot to do with raising my wife's kid, and the whole relationship was conflicting.. so I never really felt good at home, and drank more then came the kratom. But the same reason I started to take it, it has now caused me to have. But worse... The anxiety I would compare to "" fear of death anxiety""...it's that debilitating and scary and I get stuck thinking about it but it's so wierd..I have to stop so I'm tapered and now stopping tomorrow but still have to work.. and I have to be really focused at work because I run heavy equipment.. thought about going to doctor for some *balancing"" meds or anti depressants ( which I should have done 10 years ago) or anti anxiety, because it's hard to relax and when I'm home I can't get nothing done because of anxiety and thinking , and it was manageable with beer ( which wasn't good and led to me falling prey I think) but with kratom it is now worse.. reading all these posts has really helped and it's good to see people doing the right thing on their own and fighting..Keep it up because nothing feels better than feeling better!

I was able to taper from 25GPD to about 1gpd over 4-5 days without seeing any bad withdrawals.

What I did was use Memantine at a very low dose (5-15mg) daily. This is the staple for anyone who wants an easier quit in my opinion.

I was a daily user for last 8 months, quit probably 3 times before. This was by far the easiest.

I had very minor RLS.

I did not experience any night of sleep less than 6 hours total EVER throughout my quit.

I know I am still a candidate for PAWS so I am mostly discussing acute withdrawal stages.

Basically memantine helped my taper and quit amazingly. After about 2 or 3 days without any kratom I also quit memantine and haven’t needed any since.

I would also recommend anyone quitting also quit caffeine during the same day you go off kratom completely, even if just for a 2 or 3 day period. Then when you have a REALLY bad day utilize coffee or energy drinks or whatever to give you a needed boost.

I also used 15ug LSD on bad days, it was an amazing tool as well. Only 1 or 2 days a week.

I also began looking into diet and realized a lot of foods I can’t eat alongside gluten (blood work shows gluten sensitivity). I have tried eliminating all nightshades, peanuts, corn, rice and wheat and I am having some of the best productivity and mindset I have ever had in my life. Obviously not everyone has an issue with food but I suggest using the Kratom withdrawal phase to quit anything else you might then be able to use as a crutch on some of the later bad days.",2

I have never been able to use kratom without abusing it— always ending up with my toes hanging over the gutter. Well, from starting with shots in July to 20+gpd by October, I said I needed to stop. I reduced my dose to 2 tspd and it was hell at first. Then continued to use about that much, slipping a couple times, for two weeks. Then I dumped the rest out on Wednesday. 

I experienced very mild withdrawals after that. Now they are imperceptible. Maybe it is because I didn’t consume it that long? Well, prayers answered to say the least. 

I hope this message finds you well, and I know that there are a variety of experiences with quitting kratom, so I don’t wish to diminish those— only encourage persistence. It gets better. I am very glad to be off kratom. 

Note that I did get hooked way worse a few years ago— almost dropping out of college, literally curled up in a ball on the floor balling my eyes out, off and on for a week or so. 

So I know what bad is like and I know what worse is like. 

Best wishes",3

This time I’ve been back on for almost one year but kept it to no more than 18gpd. 

Probably should’ve saved meds for when I jumped but I used gabapentin to help me taper very quickly and still sleep.

I tapered down to 2.5gpd then tried to jump yesterday and it was rough af. Super restless to the point of torture. I have high glutamate in my genetics so my baseline is restless...the physical part of wd is always worse than mental for me. Also feel like I weigh 10,000lbs..the typical. Way worse than I expected from such a low dose. Granted, I tapered quickly. 

Clonidine didn’t help so I used some lope. About 8mg and it didn’t help too much but did help and I slept like 5 hours. 

Any advice on how quickly to taper lope to minimize prolonging wd? (I’m only planning on taking 6mg today) 

Also anyone with experience for their second long-term quit sucking way worse even after a taper?? How long did it last? I figured at 2.5g this would be a couple day deal but that feels impossible right now. 

Keepin my head up though cause I’ve done this before and remember how awesome it feels to turn the corner. My problem is I have to move someone next week and can’t be useless.",3

Met with my therapist at the end of the day (3rd session). Talked a lot about work, my fears/anxiety around work and not feeling like I’m competent enough for the job. Came to realize I’ve been so much on Kratom while working that it really has been stunting my ability to learn/retain/excel in my job. Giving myself more patience and credit of what I’m capable and looking to head into next week with renewed confidence. 

Also discussed how I can’t seem to sit and focus on work for more than 20 mins at a time - making difficult problem solving very hard. This among a host of other ADHD “symptoms” finally had me breakdown and make an appt with my doc Monday to discuss further my various symptoms and get her take on possible treatment options. Really it’s just something I struggle with during the work week and during the weekend, there are enough different, less intensive tasks to keep my flitting brain calmed enough. 

Shared with therapist also that I am reading Russel Brand’s 12 step addiction book. Was surprised that she not only heard of it but loves it. Think he does a really good job bringing 12 step recovery to the masses with how he communicates and couldn’t agree more. We also talked about SMART recovery program as well - a more cognitive approach to dealing with addiction. 

I’m not intending on joining any programs at this time but plan on reading more and gaining more insight into addiction and how we can manage it going forward. Brand’s book was very eye opening to me (finished it last night) and my first exposure to 12
Step. 

Anyway - the weekend is here again. Go out and seize the day. Make the most of your time relish in your new found sobriety or for those still struggling to quit - make today the first day of the rest of your life. 🙏",12

I had been off of it for about 5 days until recently and it was a very different experience than I’m used to. 

Physically it still sucked. Insomnia, anxiety(what’s incredible though is that my depression actually significantly improved), and the worst of all is the akathisia(restlessness and feeling of extreme bodily discomfort) which is enough to feel maddening. What’s strange though is that after the first couple of days, I started to feel highly motivated for the future, something I hadn’t felt in months. I also started enjoying socializing more, and I overall felt like my emotions came back. My productivity increased, though the akathisia was dreadful and prevented me from basically doing anything leisurely. 

Recently I got a hold of a small amount of kratom to ease the restlessness for a while, and while it got rid of the akathisia and gave me the usual dopamine hit from taking kratom, my energy and motivation vanished. My emotions became deadened once again, and my productivity has decreased. I feel depressed again. 

I’m basically posting this because I see very little talk about the benefits of quitting. After all, what’s the point of quitting if the cons outweigh the pros? My experience I think has been integral to my choice to stay off of kratom entirely for the foreseeable future. 

It doesn’t give me energy, it just gives me physical comfort at the cost of being super tired even at low doses. It doesn’t make me happy, it shuts off my emotions. It doesn’t help with productivity, because my dopamine only comes from working out and taking kratom.

I know people have different experiences to mine, but when I’m on kratom, I stop feeling motivated to seek fulfillment from hobbies, work, family or friends. The dopamine hit and rush of excitement when I take it is the only thing I look forward to, but my emotions are so dulled I can’t even recognize that as a bad thing.

Tell me what your experiences have been. What benefits have you seen from quitting? Do the benefits justify the drawbacks? Would you recommend quitting to someone currently considering it?",20

The first week or so is miserable, lack of sleep, RLS, etc. You get onto the second week and then all of a sudden you pull a whole nights sleep, temps are starting to normalise. It feels fantastic getting over the hump. 

I’ve been on this great feeling for the last week or so, occasional restless sleep but otherwise relieved it’s all over. 

Then yesterday I wake up with an overwhelming sense of doom. Zero motivation and anhedonia. I beat myself up pretty badly sitting around reflecting on the mess I’ve made of my life. 

No more pink cloud. PAWS is here it seems. But I’ve dragged myself out of bed this morning, filled my phone with Bill Burr podcasts and motivational music. Lacing up my boots to go for a big hike, a bit over 15kms. 

I’m sure these dark feelings will pass. And that I’ll feel a lot better once I’ve got through today. I hope everyone is staying strong and on course to leave this part of our lives behind us. Wishing you all a happy day, and relief for those who are suffering. Peace

Did well and was taking 2-3 extract pills a day. Over the last two years, that habit grew to 9-11 extract pills a day (conversion chart says that’s the equivalent of 80-90grams a day of normal leaf or powder). Realized lately that it was dictating my life and that I fell into an addiction just as deep as my previous. Finally said this is enough, but as every else has dealt with, I work 7 days a week and can’t take time off to kick. Decided to give it a shot anyway and took one day off, went as long as I could bare without taking one (about 12 hours), took one and then tried to get through the rest the day with an old gaba script I had. Had to work the next day, but woke up feeling surprisingly not too bad. Sleep was very poor, really crampy with back aches. I’m now on day 4 of only taking 1 extract capsule a day and not feeling too terrible, just not feeling great. I work our religiously (2-3 hours a day) which may have been the reason this hasn’t been absolutely terrible, but I wanted to give hope to people out there that they can get through this and sometimes it’s not as bad as you’d expect it to be. I had scrolled through many pages on reddit of users describing their experience like they are going through death, and tbh, it scared the living $!?$ out of me. Just know, a lot of times the expectations of the withdrawal can be worse than the actual withdrawal itself. I plan I going CT on this upcoming Tuesday when I’m going to take another day off. Already decided I’m going to force myself on a 3-4 mile hike and a couple hours at the gym.

To give you a bit of backstory on myself – I’ve been constantly switching back and forth between hydros and kratom for the past 3 years. My personal preference was always the pills, but I initially saw kratom as a great substitute for when I couldn’t find anything (which was quite often so I was using kratom much more frequently). I was averaging around 3-5g of Red Horned Maeng Da at least 3x per day.

My girlfriend is my rock and I’ve screwed up with her multiple times in the past by lying about being sober. She has always supported me but the main problem was that I would always try to hide it instead of being transparent with her. I’m not sure what it was but I think I was just so ashamed to admit that I had a problem. She still doesn’t know that I was using and have recently been sober, so that’s one reason why I wanted someone to share my story with.

I’ve wanted to quit for a long time now and had tried multiple times without lasting more than 36 hours. The worst withdrawal symptom for me was always the excessive sweating, body aches, and the hot/cold flashes that made it impossible to ever be comfortable. I was laid off from my job over the summer due to Covid-19, and I saw this time away from work as the perfect time to quit for real. Two months later and I was still using daily and had accepted a new job that started in 5 days.

I’m not sure what pushed me to actually go CT but something inside of me just knew that I couldn’t continue to live like this. There was a huge part of me that was convinced that I would never be normal again – always relying on a crutch to feel ‘normal’.

To my complete surprise, I am now on day 9 of sobriety from Kratom. My new job is 30 minutes away from my house and I started working here 5 days ago. Yesterday I caught myself googling the nearest Kratom store near me because I thought that ‘oh it won’t set me back’ and ‘I’ve earned this.” I drove to the store on my lunch break and just sat in the parking lot for 15 minutes – to be honest I opened up this sub and started reading testimonies from others and it helped me talk myself down from the ledge. Not to be over the top but I almost teared up when I drove away without going inside (I know that the old me wouldn’t have thought twice before picking up).

For anyone else who is in a similar position I want you to know that you can do this. The first 3-5 days were pretty rough but I feel myself coming back each day, little by little. It’s very hard to describe how amazing it feels to wake up in the morning and not worry about my next dose.

I hope you all achieve your goals and I’m always available to chat with anyone who needs a little extra push.

Talking to as many people you can about this, FULLY, TRANSPARENTLY, is only going to 1. Make you feel better because everyone will be so proud of you 2. Put your name to this new direction and 3. Make your life less of a shady secret and finally commit to it publicly. ALSO, something I don’t recommend to everyone, but for me it was HUGE...

Almost at 2 weeks from CT from years of 15-20/30 gpd and even seeing this tat (I’ll comment a pic if I can, this sub doesn’t allow photos to be posted) out of the corner of my eye reminds me that “this too shall pass” when I get a craving or I feel some PAWS coming on... stay strong and know there are people that will BEND OVER BACKWARDS FOR YOU IF YOU OPEN UP TO THEM. YOU ARE LOVED. YOU DO HAVE VALUE. YOU CAN GET OFF THIS SHIT AND YOU WILL. Take care of yourself and talk to someone you care about today, RIGHT NOW! Love you!",8

For the past week I’ve went to bed planning to jump, woke up freaking out, scared and anxious and caved. This morning when I woke up I took a hit off of my medical marijuana vape pen to calm myself and made a decision to try this. I’m mot in bad WD yet but I feel it around the edges. When my wife wakes up in a couple hours I’m gonna give her my keys, wallet and credit cards. That way I have no way to acquire any K during a weak moment. I know if I can just get through the next 3 days I’ll be ok. My body bounces back pretty quick as long as I exercise. 

I really hope I can do this. I keep trying to remember when the WD gets bad and my mind says Kratom will make it go away, that’s bullshit. Kratom is why I feel like this and it will mot make it go away. It’ll only hide it until next time. Please send prayers, juju and whatever my way. Generally speaking, if I make it through the first 24 I can commit better cause I don’t wanna turn back. I know day 1 isn’t the hardest physically but it’s a huge one for me mentally.

2020-11-13 08:48:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jtgn9a/here_we_go/,Here we go....,"Good afternoon everybody. I hope you are all doing well.

I discovered kratom back in 2015. It wasn't long before I was taking 35/40 grams per day.
After 18 months I quit. It was very difficult for me mentally. Physically was ok. I never get RLS for some reason. I tapered down 1 gram a day over 40 days.
The lower I got the worse I felt but I made it. I got free.
Post accutes lasted a long time finding little joy in my life. 
I knew I had to make changes so I rented my house out.  Packed my bag and headed off to Asia.

I forgot about kratom and started to enjoy life again. Now I do suffer from underlying depression and some anxiety but I know that if I exercise eat well socialise when I want I can manage life and the underlying depression.

Life was going well. 

In March of this year I returned to the UK for what was to be just 3 weeks to see my family get a new visa and head back to the life I was enjoying.

One week later Covid struck. And now I've been stuck here for 8 months.

5 months ago I picked up a bag of kratom. It was going to be a one off but you know how this story pans out I guess.
Then I bought another ounce and another.
I was only taking 3 gpd to begin with but over the last 5 months that has grown to a max of 10.5 gpd which was on Wednesday. 

I've been planning my quit for a few weeks. I finished a project that I've been working on and Wednesday was my last day of a full dose.

I am doing a slow taper as I need to protect my mental health. I have been getting more depressed being stuck here in the UK and not being able to travel. So I need to take it slow. Slow and steady wins the race for me.

Yesterday I reduced by a gram and I've done the same today. So I'm now down to 8.5 gpd which is a good start. I feel fine writing this post.

I don't have a set plan because experience tells me that feeling my way through works well. Some days I'll stay on the same dose and some days I may only reduce by point 2 or so. 

It would be very easy to beat myself up because I returned to a substance that does not do me any good but I won't do that. I've accepted I made a mistake so now it's time to get on with quitting and quit I will.
It may take several weeks but that's fine. 

So here I am again back on r quitting kratom using this great resource to hopefully help me and I hope to help others to. When I first found r quitting kratom back in 2015/16 there  were less than 1000 members.
There are over 17k today.
I think that proves how a supposedly mild stimulant is in fact a powerful narcotic.

I'm very grateful that I have somewhere  to write my little story. I don't have anyone I can open up to about my addiction. Not that my friends wouldn't listen. They just wouldn't understand. 

So on a positive note. I have only been using for 5 months and it's not a massive dose which is good. I only dose twice a day. 12 hours apart. 
It's going to make my quit easier. I'm sure I'll struggle further down the line but my resolve is strong and I will quit. 

If you are thinking of quitting. Make a plan and get stuck in.
If you are quitting keep going soon you will be in a better place.
And if you quit and are experiencing paws I really feel for you. Paws is for some us worse that the quit itself but you will get there in the end.

I am the captain of my ship and the master of my Destiny.

Cheers Freedom Baba",25

2020-11-13 07:22:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jtg1qt/first_slip_in_my_taper/,First Slip in My Taper,"So I’ve been tapering from 70gpd after 2 yrs of daily use (probably haven't missed a dose in that time).  I dropped down to 40 to start and felt really bad to a point where it impacted work.  I interact with customers all day.  Anyway, went up to 45 which was fine and then started dropping @2 gpd spread across 5 evenly spaced doses.  

Then Wed night, I got really freaked out about this election crap.  I didn’t really think it was related to Kratom WD.  Then I had a really busy day yesterday which added more stress.  I was pretty panicked, fearful, overwhelmed, and depressed.  I didn’t have any physical wd symptoms so didn’t think that was the issue.

Somehow I convinced myself that it was ok to just slip one day to get settled down.  I went right back up to a couple 12+ g doses.  That’s certainly fixed my mood issues.  But the other thing I did was remove myself from social media and the news.  Basically I’m burying my head in the sand.

Looking back, I’m thinking maybe this mental state was part of WDs.  Even though I didn’t have anything physical, I can’t find a reason why I would have been so jacked up mentally yesterday.  My only suspicion is that it’s because I paid more attention to the news and social media about the election.  Even so, it seems irrational how jacked up I got about it looking back now.

I’m back on my taper now, but wondering if anyone has any opinions/thoughts on if my mental state sounds like Kratom wd.  Or was it just a bad day that would have been a bad regardless.

I want to know because if it was wd, I need to prepare myself for the next time it happens. Knowing it’s related to wd will help me fight off the thoughts of getting some temporary relieve with a higher dose.",7

What happened was I ended up in an emergency room my heart stopped and they had to use a defibrillator and CPR to get my heart started again. They intubated me and I ripped the tubes out after I was resuscitated. Then when they tried to intubate me again I ended up choking and throwing up all over the place when I ripped the tube out the second time. I started having major seizures in the hospital and my heart stopped again. So once again after having a defibrillator done on me and CPR for the second time they finally revived me and I was in a coma for a day and a half. When I came to after the day and a half I ripped the tube out for the third time. And the doctor said fuck it. If he lives he lives if he dies he dies so be it. I was discharged from that hospital shortly thereafter and taken to and a Avita facility where they kept me for observation and put me on a detox protocol of Gabapentin and Ativan. They did a modified taper where I was only on ativan for about 2 days and then they cut me off. The upshot is I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms doing the Gabapentin and Ativan. I stayed in this crisis stabilization unit that was endorsed bye an avira four an additional 7 days. What fucking sucks is I had to die literally a proper death before I can understand this shit is poison and I want to create a March on Washington if I can get as many people behind me to do this I will do everything in my power to make this fucking bath salt rat poison horseshit illegal how many people can I get behind me to make this happen,0

Quit 3 days ago because since about January I developed what I guess is tension headaches (no pain, just immense pressure in my skull) and what has been diagnosed as pulsatile tinnitus which occurs with the tension. I also developed aura/ocular migraines. I had 2 migraines ever in my life prior to January but they never came with the blind spots/light shows that I call ocular migraines, nor had I ever before had the intracranial pressure or pulsatile tinnitus.  
  
I believe all these things may have been slowly brought on by kratom. I’ve been freaked out though (never had any abnormal/major health issues before) so I went to my eye doc, who referred me to an ENT, who gave me an MRA order to check what’s up with my head (tumor being the scarier possibility) but the MRA cost ($630) comes out of my deductible aka my pocket. So I’m quitting kratom and waiting to see how/if things change.  
  
I am waking up at 3, 4:00 with insane headaches which I have gotten a couple of times before on days between doses, so I expected that. But today I’ve been hit with ocular migraines, intracranial pressure, and constant headache. I’m trying to remember to hydrate but I get a C- this week for my efforts there. I’m hoping quitting leads to an end of all these new 2020 symptoms in the next couple weeks/months. I’m hoping too that my early AM headaches go away very very soon. 
  
My questions for y’all are: has anyone had similar head/vision issues that you suspect were related to kratom, did they go away after you quit, how long did it take for the symptoms to disappear if so, and how long should I expect to suffer these killer headaches while I withdraw?

I have spent a lot of time focused on the withdrawals, PAWS, the regret of what I missed because of the crazy amount of kratom I was taking every day, and every other shit thing I've experienced. But I just realized that if I were to talk about that, I'd be bringing up the past. It's actually behind me now. I didn't think I'd ever feel like I'm looking forward to what's to come. 

I look in the mirror and see that I'm thriving and not suffering. I don't look away in disgust or disdain, but rather just give myself a nod of approval. I know I'm back on track. I even registered for the spring semester at college to finish my degree in mechanical engineering. This would not have happened if I hadn't quit kratom, trust me.

I think before I act now. I pick healthier foods at the grocery store and come home and cook them, instead of stopping to grab some takeout. I don't lash out at someone because I'm upset. I stop and think why I'm upset or unhappy with something or someone, and I try to change my perspective. I'm not the cocky know it all son of a bitch I was on kratom. I even quit weed because I felt it slowed my recovery down.

I feel giddy over small things. Not in a manic way but in an anticipatory sort of way. I can't wait to see people and interact. I can't wait to get comfortable after a long day. I am stoked to go on a walk in the woods. When did this start? Probably before I realized it but it just dawned on me.

Music sounds damn good. Like I feel it in my chest, building and bursting like a pretty flower. I don't judge myself for enjoying things for what they are, in fact I'm proud of myself. I was constantly criticizing my tastes and now I feel I deserve to have these experiences. I want people to feel these things too. I want people to know I'm proud of them for enjoying their lives and that I support their journey. 

I feel like I hit a second puberty. Muscles feel stronger, hair feels thicker, I feel limber. I have a lot more energy. My sex drive is thru the roof and I'm pretty much horny all the time now. Before I didn't even care to try to get in the mood. 

The best part? I have just became acutely aware of these feelings in the past few days. It just took some time and patience. What felt like the end now feels like it's the beginning. Please hang in there. It does get easier. Much love to all and to anyone reading, feel free to message me for anything whether it's help quitting or just to talk :)",29

Maybe someone has experience with a similar time frame of using kratom daily in similar amounts. I except RLS, depression, anhedonia, lack of motivation, movements are going to be harder etc. But I don't think that this will last longer than a week.

&#x200B;

I've been an avid kratom user for a few years now. I did put it down in 2017 for about 2 months during a whole other issue I went through. I am currently using around 3.5g every three hours.  


6AM, 9AM, 12PM, 3PM(4PM depending if I nap), 6PM, 9PM and sometimes before bed depending on what I got going on. A total of around 18-21GPD. I'm not sure if the thought of not having my kratom is what is driving the fear of it instead of the actual w/d themselves. I've gone 12-24 hours and I get really bad RLS and watery eyes with lots of yawning.   


I know this question is really subjective, but I'm in a really good spot. How long should I take off work? I have a week coming off for thanksgiving I was going to use to quit, a total of 11 days. My job is a very physically demanding job, lots of walking so it might be good for the PAWS side of things as long as I can force myself to get up and go out.   


I, like many others am quitting because I'm tired of wearing a Kratom shroud. I want to know what kind of person I am without the assistance of substances. When I leave this earth, I want to leave without any anchor of substance. I want my brain chemistry natural. I want to experience the joys of life. I don't hate Kratom, but I don't want to live with a spoon in my mouth of this stuff every 3 hours, the stomach aches, the bowel problems, the mood swings etc. 

Anyone who might be looking to quit, I am definitely looking for a sober buddy to start this off with if possible. We can complain to each other about how bad this sucks and joke about it later.   


It's time for us to make the move on taking our lives back. I'm scared, but I'm ready. I start 11/20/2020. You guys will be my lifeline for sure. 

Much love <3",14

So my boyfriend and myself are coming off of opioids. We have almost three weeks clean👏🏼 we have been using kratom for those three weeks the last week we have only been doing once in the morning 2 grams each then once in the evening 2 grams each so 4 grams total a day. I’ve been reading HORROR stories about withdrawal from kratom and I’m legit like so anxious about it now. I know everyone is different, but just wanted to see what everyone’s thoughts were if we were to just taper the 4 grams a day down will we be going through the withdrawals of kratom next after getting through all the debt we paid from the percs/oxy?? It seems after three weeks I’m finally feeling better from the opioid withdrawal so just making sure we didn’t screw ourselves by quitting the opioids with the kratom. The kratom doesn’t make me feel high in anyway just less anxious and my legs don’t ache (not sure if those are lingering sometimes from the opioid withdrawal tho).. how long would you guys say it takes to become depend on kratom? Hopefully this makes sense. You all seem so knowledgeable so appreciate the help and taking time out of your day to help an extremely anxious girl out! 😊",1

I tend to get withdrawal symptoms from it pretty easily, which has been a great deterrent. Slipped up though, and seem to be paying the price. Not to mention, this time I somehow got up to 30+ gpd almost instantly.

I've noticed since I slipped up, I've been in a pretty big funk. I'm on day 9 now without it. Yesterday I finally had the energy to work out, and boy did it help! I did the same today...pushed through the fatigue and worked out for an hour. It helped a little, but not nearly as much as I was hoping. Hours later, back in the dark hole.

I'm a little worried as I'm on a pretty serious antidepressant (Nardil) which has worked GREAT until I made this mistake. Naturally now I'm catastrophizing and fearing that this has nothing to do with kratom, but rather the Nardil giving up on me.

Back to my question - is it normal to feel pretty down 9 days in, and unable to get any strong relief from exercise? In past experiences, exercise has been a pretty solid fix for me to get through the worst of WDs.",5

Im actually really shocked how much of a mental fuckery kratom addiction is. I almost feel like I came out of a weird kratom coma. Like everything was being fucked with while on kratom... emotions, sleep, eating, depression, energy.. everything.

Ill admit that I have had some cravings this week but it wasnt hard to overcome them. I just thought about how if i use again then I am back to square one and what i am doing is not enough. Which means more intensive rehab stuff and what not. Honestly im pretty lazy and I dont want to do more work. So i figure itd be easier to just stay off it. I know that if i use once it will turn into an everyday thing. I cant deny thats how its been so why would i assume any difference this time.

At the end of the day, I feel so good that i didnt break and use. I literally say to myself ""think about how shitty youd feel if you did use today"". that helps a lot.

Not really bothering with it in my life when on Kratom (obviously) but have been using it to help with WD's during late night insomnia sessions.

Felt great after that I must say. I usually manage 2 & 3 minute holds with 4 minutes this week as well, but just find it really strange. I'm not super fit, but used to cycle and do triathlon before I found Kratom over the past year, but now don't have much fitness or aerobic capacity to speak of.

One, this plant seems to be tailor made for dependency, for several reasons. 

The early adopters seem to be people trying to kick opiate addiction, and were lead to believe that this “miracle” plant; cheap, available, “natural” plentiful, and a cure to being dope sick. 

Personally, I never had an opiate addiction - but I came to know Kratom through a family member who had one, and was using Kratom to stay off traditional opiates. 

I started very slow with Kratom, taking it occasionally, then daily, then twice daily, then 3-4 times daily. I had no idea how dependent the brain would become on this leaf. I had become dependent on Kratom and once I realized it, I decided to quit. 

I immediately went from 30gpd to 15gpd - for 2 weeks, and then I jumped from there 10 days ago. 

Looking back, I feel that besides the physical and mental addiction, and all the issues that come from that, the biggest issue I see now with Kratom is that it creates many of the most undesirable traits as a male partner. 

Your sex drives dies, you become moody, and your testosterone levels go down. It causes baldness, bad breath, tossing and turning in bed - the list goes on. 

If Kratom doesn’t destroy your life, it seems rather likely that it will destroy your romantic relationship. 

As far as jumping from 2 year daily use - I will say that I was really really tired for the first week, however, after reading this forum, I knew I would not feel great. I felt very hot and sweaty for a week, probably the most difficult WD symptom, I had mild RLS, still do a little - but nothing really bad. My runny nose/eyes in the morning cleared up, my energy is coming back slowly. I’m happy to be off Kratom and not drinking the sludge 3-4 times a day. It really was a dead end in so many ways. Whatever the drug, reliance always leads to the same outcome. 

“All addiction starts with pain and ends with pain” 

I wish everyone on here the beat on their journey. Just like all other drugs, Kratom is not inherently evil in itself, it’s the effects that it causes to the body and mind over years of abuse that cause the problems.",13

I don't know what brought it on, but it crowded out every other thought and I haven't been able to get rid of it for probably around an hour now.

I don't have any kratom in my apartment and stores are closed for the night, plus I don't think I would have tried to get some anyway, because I've committed to quitting.  I also don't have any alcohol in the house, which is probably good because I would almost certainly be drunk by now if I did.  I reaaaaaaaaaaally want a drink though.  I don't even have any chocolate or good junk food.  I'm just sitting here desperately wishing for some kind of narcotic or something to consume and plowing through a bag of sunflower seeds (in the shell) because at least it gives my hands and mouth something to do.

I'm at 15 days, and this is the first time I've had a craving like this.  The desire to use kratom has of course entered my mind, but it's been pretty easy so far to just acknowledge the thought and move on.  But right now it feels like I can't focus on anything else.  I tried doing some work or reading a book, but it's no good.  I've contemplated doing some housework but honestly that just makes me want to use even more because I hate housework.  I'm already taking NAC, but other than that I don't know what else to do about intrusive thoughts.

* I am dosing 4 times a day an exact amount (currently 3g)
* Between doses the last 25% of the time I am DEFINITELY in withdrawal (currently the last hour of a 4 hour frequency) VERY uncomfortable, but bearable.
* I am having pretty bad sleep and waking up with powerful anxiety. (I generally take a 1/2 dose in the middle of the night until this lets up)

I am hoping that this is normal, and I can expect I will level out.  I am assuming I could go slower and still have a successful taper, but I am appreciating the challenge, and want to get to the end.

Was using k for over a decade, not measuring doses back before I started tapering, but I was taking 4 heaping spoonfuls a day....not measuring teaspoons, mind you,...just big spoons from the kitchen.

I’ve used kratom for years pretty steadily at 30 GPD and periodically worse in the past. I have successfully quit CT once 1.5 years ago after a major life event woke me up and that same life event caused my use to escalate to probably 60-80 GPD. Pretty disgusting. CT was insane and literally the hardest thing I have ever done with debilitating symptoms for at least a month. I didn’t sleep at all for close to 5 weeks and no one I’ve ever told has believed me. That was mostly due to RLS but I remember every morning not “waking up” but simply just getting up out of bed....Had about 3 months clean and the thing that caused me to use was “I was having a good day shit why not a weak old concentrate shot” and it was downhill from there. 

I’ve been pretty steadily at 30 GPD and here’s my taper plan:
6 G in the morning and then four 5 G doses evenly spaced throughout the day. I’ll keep a 4 G dose for those mid morning emergencies but if I don’t need it, I won’t take it and I’ll shave off 4 G for that day and proceed with the plan. I want to decrease at a rate of 1 GPD till I get down to 2-4 G and hold there for a week so my body fully adjusts and then decide how to proceed so that would take about 5 weeks total. I have a lock box with a timer on it to keep me out of the K. It works really well for anyone curious about it but it is kinda pricey. It’s called captured discipline. 

I was thinking that maybe I should switch to a white strain at some point bc it is less potent. Any thoughts on whether red green or white makes a difference for tapering?

Is 5 weeks too short of a taper? Should I hold at 2-4 GPD for a couple weeks or more to get fully adjusted? Is there much point to continue tapering down from 2-4 GPD to like 1 GPD? 

I’m also gonna do all the other things commonly discussed (exercise eating well etc) and possibly some valerian and magnesium  and Cacao powder but in past attempts I’ve tried every possible OTC “remedy” with not much success. I might also try to get a prescription for a sleeping aid since that was the only thing that helped me last time. I use snus, but I don’t drink any alcohol, no weed, no other drugs or shitty ass head shop supplements.

I know some of it is that I'm getting older - my younger brother has a massively receding hairline and he hasn't used an opioid in his life, so it could have nothing to do with Kratom, but I definitely am nervous about losing any more due to kratom, and I'm hoping if I quit that the hair remaining will grow back quicker.

Has anyone seen any scalp improvements in the months after quitting?

FWIW I had been pretty good at 3-4g/day before the pandemic but now I'm at 6-7g/day, never more, rarely less.",3

I think it may be an initial side effect of the naltrexone I am now taking.  Called my doctor, going to see him tomorrow and ask for a vivitrol shot.  Exercising every day and I think this is making a huge difference in how I’m feeling both physically and emotionally.  Appetite is coming back too finally.  Still not 100% but eating isn’t a chore anymore.  Talking with my fiancé every day is really anchoring me too.  She’s away for about 3 more weeks.  Huge thanks to the folks in the sub, as always.

Today is day 46 and the longest I have had free from both Kratom and Phenibut in quite some time (2 years at least). And for this I am Grateful. I realize staying this course is the most important thing in my life right now, and the urge to go back is not worth it no matter what the case may be. 

This isn't to say that this phase of my life has been a breeze. Yesterday, I experienced extreme fatigue, boredom, apathy, craving, confusion, and dejection. I simply had to just fight tooth and nail to not do anything stupid. I called and texted several individuals aware of my struggles to talk about my conflicts and my ""brilliant ideas"" for why maybe today I could use successfully. Luckily they were able to talk me off the ledge and put some sense in me. Even when I know what they will say its still beneficial to hear it I find. 

In reality this is just a ""one moment at a time"" journey, and every moment we allow to go by without hurting ourselves with addiction we are on our way to a happier healthier and more wholesome life. Despite the journey not being an easy one, it is the best chance I have for what I imagine can be a very decent life. 

I am weening down my baclofen at the moment, which is another struggle, but it is the only med I am taking. I need to have some compassion here and understand it is another part of the process. I used to take about 3-4 meds, so being down to just 1 is at least some form of an accomplishment. 

In the morning I often wake up with anxiety and fear of what is to come and some of the classic questions in my mind sound like this 

""what is going to happen with my life?""   ""do I need to go back to school?"" ""how can I make more money?""

 ""what do I really want to do? and why am I so confused about it"" ""Is my company going to make it or is this all just a waste of time?"" 

""will I ever be happy, stable, free, and confident about my direction in life?"" 

Im guessing these are some big life questions and many of you may be able to relate but I do know one thing. More will unfold and more will be disclosed, but above all else I must have the resolve to know that going back to Kratom is nasty life sentence. Its simply NOT AN OPTION. It will get better for all of us and it is possible. Kratom will only hold us back. The choice is simple. NOT TODAY, NO MATTER WHAT!",30

My 1st was probably the worst. I was taking 13grams every 4 hours and then keep a cup full of it to sip on throughout the day/night. It was a red and green blend. I did this for a grand total of 6 months. I loved how it kept weight off, how I felt so confident, and it gave me this edge. But then, slowly it began to wear off. Instead I would go through constant withdrawals completely losing my ""edge"" and my faux confidence. I decided to quit, but only after leaving my job. It was a means to an end in a way. I did my research and chose CT method. I was sick for a week in bed. I'd never felt back pain and joint pain like that before. My nose was constantly running and I would get cold/hot flashes and awful stomach pains. These subsided and I was left with PAWS. I went to the Dr and straightened my dosage out on prozac. 

My 2nd go round, was went I started to put weight on. I decided to have ""just a little"" before each meal. That didn't last long, because  then I needed it to help me get up in the morning and once again my edge and confidence plummeted. Here I took 5gpd. I again did research and decided I would taper this time. It was drawn out like people said and one I hit 1 or 2 gpd, I took the jump. My back pain was back but I didn't stop working that time. I had mild depression for a few weeks while my body readjusted. All that was taken from me with kratom was given back, so I was happy. I vowed never again. 

The 3rd time, ugh. I told myself, I could probably handle the pill form better and wanted to give it a try. Again this was mostly because I worried about my weight. I barely took any. My dosage equaled about 2-4 gpd for about 2 months. Again I felt it was taking stripping away my confidence as I would be going through a small withdrawal ever few hours.  I decided to quit CT. This was the shortest time I had ever dealt with WD. 

Here now at my 4th and -God help me- my last time. I got up to 7gpd or so for about 5 months. I felt much like the failure I was. My excuse this time? Energy, weight management and thoughts that I can quit ""just like last time."" I'm on my 3 day. My WD's include the worst RLS I have ever experienced, even getting into my arms. Back pain and joint pain, stomach issues and fatigue. But I already feel better. I can smell things again, think more clearly, and slowly I am regaining confidence in myself as I can be so tempted by my own lies.  

My spouse takes a large doses and has now for 2 years. So it's all around me. He's tried to quit but I don't believe he's really ready so I try not to pressure him. 

My most helpful treatment for me for rls was eating things high in iron and taken the hottest showers or bath. My back pain is still going strong but I can't take Tylenol because it worsens the RLS. I didn't go to work for 3 days. Today is my first day back. Keep me in mind and thank you for reading all of this. I'm thankful for online communities like this.",13

The past few days I have straight up felt like I have been hallucinating. Coupled with inability to swallow easily, muscle tension, etc..

I saw my chiropractor yesterday and he immediately picked up that I was suffering from opioid withdrawal of some form. 

The first two places he looked at were around my adrenal glands. He said just by feeling it, my adrenal function was going CRAZY. Turns out, prolonged opioid use can really mess with your adrenal function.  essentially, as your body learns to regulate function here again, your adrenal gland can pump out those fight or flight chemicals NON-STOP, it makes sense why we can feel so INSANE in WDs.

A bit of massaging (very painful), and it was like the tension had been lifted from my whole body. If you are feeling like your brain is going crazy or senses are much sharpened, you may have some adrenal action going on. Nothing bad, just part of our body re-setting itself. Anyway, please use this video to help with self massage, it really does wonders for feeling normal.. My Chiro made me promise to share, enjoy!

Appetite is back now. Started 10km running again on day 3. Paused for 8 weeks before. K makes me stop sports completely, everytime, mostly bc of bad circulation problems occuring.

Anyway, PAWS are hitting me now, quite bad mood. But I started listening to music again today. I hope my mood stabilizes in the coming days and the deep desperation subsides.

I've been working out pretty hard since day 5 and it has been a huge gamechanger. Felt rough at first but after warming up for 10 minutes it incredible. Totally forgot I was still withdrawaling the whole time, and left in a great mood. I highly recommend physical activity to anyone going CT after the first couple of days. You won't want to, but I promise you'll feel better. Just don't go to hard if you don't workout regularly.

Haven't had too many cravings for kratom. Though today after leaving work I got excited for a brief moment thinking I was about to go home and take some kratom. Snapped out of it quickly, just caught me off guard though. I have no plans of releasing and dealing with this all over again. 

Also I'm sure some people would advise against it, but I've been smoking alot of weed and its really helped alot. I didn't smoke much while on kratom because of my anxiety but ever since I quit I've been enjoying smoking alot. Helps me to not pay attention to my RLS as well.

All in all, I know this is not permanent. 

These random lows are all part of the journey and I’ve been very irresponsible with the amount I’ve used and the amount of time this has gone on for. There have definitely been some good days scattered through out this quit. Getting a taste of what life will be like down the road gives me such great hope. 

I should add.. have been eating well and frequently. Forcing myself even if not hungry. Drinking tons of water and exercising regularly. Great strides are being taken to change the old ways. Regardless of how difficult they appear to be in the beginning. 

I do want to say this again. Regardless of how low one can get post quit. It’s nowhere near as low as when we were using this stuff. That’s for damn sure.

On the first day I went 16 hours and the withdrawals got so bad that I took 4 teaspoons at the 16th hour. The next day it was about 18 hours in and I did the same. Today I went about 16 hours and took 4 again. I am a 28 yo mom of two boys (2yo and 4yo) and I did it so I could feel better long enough to do a little more than the bare minimum with them while my husband works from home this week. 
   My question is, do you think I'm starting it all over each time I take the 4 teaspoons? Will there still be a day that I will wake up and feel better or am I just starting it over each day?

When I say 16 hours or 18 hours I mean that I am going that long not taking any and fighting the terrible excruciating withdrawals and then taking 4 tsp. I keep trying to go without taking any at all but it is so hard and I feel so much guilt for watching my kids see me not feeling well and being able to play with them as much and I get to the point where I just need a break from the pain.

I just did a drop and have spaced out my doses (part of the way I achieved the drop).  And I am on day two of that.  I started feeling sort of bad and tried the two aminos.

Anyway... could be placebo, which would be fine with me, but I almost immediately felt better and have remained feeling better.  I would say NORMAL really.  It almost seems like I could drop again.  I am going to be conservative about that, but I definitely notice a difference.

I’m socially withdrawn too. 

I can easily say withdrawal has never been this shitty before. It’s not unbearable, but the fatigue and brain zaps are really worrying me. I can’t help but think it’s something else. I was hot and sweating all last week and that finally passed.

Kratom is insidious and all consuming - at least it was for me. It was my every waking thought and I couldn’t feel normal (what I thought was normal, what became my normal) without it. I needed it for absolutely everything - including having a simple conversation. Without it, I felt sick and worthless. I was constantly in withdrawal, telling myself every day would be my last day for way way way too long. 

6 months ago I was finally able to take my last shot of the extract I was enslaved to. I’m so grateful, life truly is so much better. There really is nothing better than freeing myself from something that was destroying me, my self esteem, my confidence, my joy. 

This group was a huge help!! Kratom awareness is growing - kava/kratom bars are opening more and more and we need each other.

I've now quit 3 separate times (this is my 4th) and this time it is pretty serious.  After promising my wife I was completely done after the last quit, I couldn't resist for a number of not-so-good reasons.  She found my stash yesterday and is understandably livid.  I honestly thought she was going to leave me and take our son, which I'm not totally putting past her yet.  I told her that I understand she feels betrayed and angry, but that I also need to feel like a human who deserves respect and look forward to healing.  I feel like a tool even asking her for that, but if she wants to still be with me, I feel like it's necessary.  Is this unreasonable... should I give her more time?

This time, I am basically relinquishing all freedom, which feels pretty shitty, but I think it's the only way to make her trust me again.  I cancelled all of my credit cards and am sending her my bank statements at the end of the month.  Additionally, I am installing a GPS tracker on my phone, so she can monitor where I go.  It all sounds very unhealthy and so depressing, but I think it's my only option to save my marriage, and I know I have no one but myself to blame.  

I know I can get past the WDs no problem, since I only took about 3 GPD for the past few months.  It's the anxiety of feeling like my wife can never trust me again that is killing me.  She has put up with way more than she deserves to and I am incredibly lucky to have her.  I just can't help but feel like a complete fuck-up and don't want to spend the first couple of weeks recovering with the added stress of wondering if my wife will ever be able to trust me and respect me again.  Sorry for the depressing post... just searching for some positivity right now.",2

Went back to my normal weighed doses and compared to we what I was eyeing out, they were 60 to 75 percent smaller which would be at least 2 grams off each dose.  I haven't had any withdrawals and I actually feel better taking less.  From here I will begin my taper again",3

Honestly, I feel like I’m stuck, like I can’t get out of this hole I put myself in. One of the biggest struggles is my mind, and behavior that is not normal for me. Lately my anger has been on another level. I’m struggling with some pretty debilitating depression, and social anxiety. My worry now is that I’ll never be back to normal. I can’t stand the thought of harming my family (emotionally) which is what I’ve been doing. Then at night I’ll late in the bed wide awake going over all the people I let down that day, or the hurt on my loved ones faces.  Will this go away? Have I done too much damage to myself to ever be the father and husband I was before I started taking this shit?

For people who are 2 weeks and beyond into your quit (CT), have you noticed a massive reduction in bloat?  Particularly in your face and waist?

I'm just curious because I've noticed a significant change in bloat reduction.  Today is day 18 for me and about 5 days ago, I finally got my appetite back and love eating food.  I eat pretty low carb, so last night I had some seafood stew and cauliflower mash with parmesan cheese and a hefty amount of cracked pepper.  Despite eating a ton of food, I looked at my waist in the mirror this morning, and it is TINY compared to when I was on kratom and eating one small meal a day.

I mean, I get legit hungry but I don't get any nausea after eating.  I think the nausea was serving as negative reinforcement so that I wouldn't want to eat much if at all in the future.  There is also no more constipation.  Yes, slightly diarrhea but I'll take that over rock hard ""can't get anything out"" constipation any day.

Anyway, can others weigh in on this topic?  If you are week 2 or 3 and beyond, have you noticed a drastic reduction in face and belly bloat?",2

Was completely clean and sober for almost 7 years before this. Tried to come off mental health meds and had some bad symptoms.so tried kratom to help, which it did...at first. Elevated my mood, gave me energy yada yada.  I've had substance issues my whole.life before this...I'm in my early 30s. Had a long bout with heroin and cocaine in my early 20s and kicked everything. Havent had a drink in almost 9 years. But this fucking kratom...

Anyway I've been wanting.to quit for well over a year. The shame and guilt of using it, hiding it, fiending for it, needing it. I wanted some control back. I knew better! Smh. I have no rigjt trying anything that addictive,  just doesnt jive with my personality. Over the past year I stayed around 28g split in 4 servings throught the day. I've tapered using hirsuta a few times and always went right back up. Interdose withdrawals have plagued me from early on.

Skip to today, today will be 2.6g (1g,.6,1g). The issue is this: the mental battle. Im.not real concerned with physical symptoms. I've had much worse. It's the damn mental! The damn internal alarm clock I've set for every 5-8 hrs. That's my struggle.right now. I will be off before thanksgiving to meet my girls family substance free. My goal is to be off end of this week to give myself a week to be clean. Any advice is appreciated. I think starting wed I will drop to 2g split between 2 servings. I still have a shit ton of kratom too and I need to toss it. No reservations. The time is now! Thanks to everyone who post. I never do but have been keeping an eye on it. Cant wait to be off this shit. Also, started causing some ED and libido issues....nah son ain't having that. Just more reason to finally quit!

Today marks 21 days since my last dose. Absolutely can’t believe that I’ve made it this far along. I will say though, this quit is surrounded by an immense amount of anger and determination. I believe that something in me snapped. As uncomfortable as this is, and how bad the situation may have gotten, I’m grateful for this experience. Many say that week three turns a huge corner. Looking forward to seeing what this week will bring. 

The most challenging aspect. These days string together with no consistency at all. Day 9 was a walk in the park, where day 12 was just as uncomfortable physically as day 5. Days 18 & 19 felt like I had fallen back into a deep depression. Today I woke up after getting a few hours sleep and thought to myself, today is going to a F’ing great day. I have no idea what the day will actually bring, but I’m trying with all my might to make each new day this reality. It’s getting used to these crests and troughs. Being ok with these fluctuations. Knowing and having complete confidence that you are getting better. This is only temporary. 
(Keep in mind, my roadmap may be much more extreme compared to others. 5-6 years use @ 60-80gpd)

It’s been wonderful to read some of you are feeling so good early on in your quits. Try your best to stay this way and don’t look back. If you mess up, don’t beat yourself up. It happens to us all. Just please don’t say F it and continue using. Re-harness that strength and stop before it gets out of control once again. Quitting later down the road gets so much more difficult and drawn out. Trust me.. quit and do your best to stay quit. 

Wishing you all an amazing week ahead. Some of you are early on and in physical pain. Some of you are battling mentally. Know that this does get better. It gets so much better.

Stay strong all. Keep fighting for yourselves. I promise you that there are better day ahead.",22

I quit about three and a half months ago. My hairline went back pretty noticeably on the front of my head and I noticed some hair loss on the crown of my head/possibly on the sides(it's harder for me to tell there because I wear my hair undercut and the sides are fairly short) before I quit. I just had my second appointment with a dermatologist over my hair loss and the first time I was diagnosed with hereditary alopecia and she was considering putting me on finasteride. Today she told that she was seeing significant regrowth! So I could hold off for now on the medication and if it continues this way I will have no signs of hair loss whatsoever! I really thought kratom had accelerated my own genetic MPB or maybe that it was all MPB but it's looking like it was all from the kratom and that it's coming back! 

If you are having hair loss; just quit using. I know it's hard but tapering or going cold turkey just gets harder the longer you use. My hair is coming back noticeably at a normal timeframe given the averages given by people on the subreddit. Quitting may not solve everyone's hair loss, but it definitely can't hurt chances! 😊",17

I think it's important to mention that not knowing how many I took ***daily*** was eye opening when I started tapering via # of capsules.  I easily took 15 caps x 4 times a day. I now have 2 left and it's hard knowing I lived in an area that was very easy to receive kratom to a large area that I can't. I do know myself that I would have continued kratom had I not moved.

but wow past couple days my libido came back like ive never felt before... dont even remember feeling this good. i literally feel better then if i had kratom in my system... i feel better then i did when i was on kratrom.

dude katom fucks you up and you dont even realise how... the mental fog it puts you in and your not even aware if it!!

before i used to have to take kratom just to go hang out with my cousin or to visit my parents just so i could talk and converse with them without being crabby / in a bad / weird mood. yet at the same time the kratom was the shit putting me in weird moods!!! i had to take it all the time just to feel normal, and because of that there was always times during the day id be in weird moods because i didnt dose soon enough

also when i wake up i have energy.. i used to wake up always groggy and lethargic for years!!!

now i wake up ready to go like its incredible its hard to even imagine untill you experience it.

yesterday i did have weird itchy skin / dry skin (day 15 clean) and im not sure if its from kratom or what but wasnt too big of a deal... i still felt great because of the mood / energy i had.

Idk If this was meant to be a test but as I was cleaning my room I found a small kratom sample that contained 5 grams, my mind got the best of me and I used it shortly after, was not worth it AT ALL. All of that pain I went through the first few days of CT just to surrender so easily.  Woke up today though feeling good again ready to just pick up where I left off. As much as I regret taking that sample, at least it was only 5 grams, so physically I feel like it didn’t set me back too far, and it also felt cathartic in the sense that it reminded me why I stopped in the first place. Just wanted to be truthful to everyone on here about what happened, appreciate all of the support I’ve been given the past few days.",4
2020-11-09 08:23:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jqxiob/quit_and_stay_quit/,Quit and STAY QUIT!,"As we all know, quitting is hard enough as it is... acute withdrawals, mental cravings, etc. But in actuality, anyone can ""quit""... for a few hours, a day, two days, three, etc. In my experience, STAYING QUIT is the key. It sounds so simple, doesn't it? It takes hard work, patience, determination and diligence. If you're just starting out, I wouldn't take that part of recovery lightly. I know you have enough on your plate as it is with acutes and just taking it one day at a time (hell, I took it one hour at a time at first), but if we're really serious about never using kratom ever again, I found that eventually I had to prepare myself for the long haul.

Here are some things I did and continue to do:

* Threw out all my kratom stashed throughout my house. Saving it for ""just in case"" will lead to trouble.

* Get on a schedule. Mine is Wim Hof Method breathing exercises shortly after waking up. Followed by jogging or walking. Taking the dogs out. Followed by a cold shower. And checking this sub frequently. Find what works for you. 

* If you're not working, STAY BUSY throughout the day. I've fallen in love with yard work. It's amazing how much I neglected my house while addicted to kratom. When winter hits, I plan to start on the inside of the house. As the saying goes ""idle hands are the devils playground"".

* Practice random acts of kindness. Help someone, expecting nothing in return. It'll help you more than it helps them.

* Find something you enjoy and do it. Something positive. It's ok to ""treat"" yourself. Or find a healthy hobby.

I'm sure there's more that's I'm missing at the moment. The point is love your family, friends and yourself. Quit and STAY QUIT!",12

An early morning for sure but I’m in a good place mentally. I feel more at peace and in control. I hear back to work this Thursday with a renewed sense of confidence both in my abilities to work and ability to manage the stress that will surely be coming. 

Another key thing I am realizing - in part thanks to Russel Brand’s book on addiction is that addict behavior, whatever the vice - is really a selfish act designed to try and make us feel better or escape other negative feelings. Instead though, when the desire to use or engage in your addictive behavior, stop and take personal inventory of your life and what you are thankful for and then think about what you can do to help others. I’m starting to think that real joy and contentment doesn’t come from pursing material wealth or fleeting feelings from substances but connecting with other people and doing for others instead of for yourself.

In the last few days I have been logging the amount of Kratom I have been taking in 24 hours which is 22 grams.

I am experiencing some mild withdrawal symptoms at the current dosage but will not increase the dosage because I want to stabilize as I continue with a taper schedule.  I have been using about 20 to 25 grams daily for about 1.5 years.  And I decided to quit because I really want to be free of this stuff.

I've been a constant extract consumer for about 4 years now. I was taking the little $6-10 shots that look like the little energy shots. I was averaging about 12 a day (which is a whole case). I took the week off to start my CT since my job is pretty physically demanding. 
Yesterday was Day 1 and I didn't feel too bad. It really hit me when I tried to sleep and I tossed and turned all night with mild RLS. Today is Day 2 and I can feel it a little more now. The cold chills have been annoying and now I can feel the aches in my body I was suppressing with the kratom. Lack of energy is fairly high and I'm starting to get the upset stomach. From what I've read, it gets worse after the first 3-4 days so I'm trying to prepare for that but hoping I can push through this time. My son is due in late December/early January and I'm hoping I can have most of the WDs under control by then and im hoping I can cope at work next week while still dealing with it. 
My question is, do the cold/fever chills go away fairly quickly or is this something ill deal with for a while? I work outdoors for roughly 4-5 hours a day during the first part of my shift and winter is creeping up so I know its going to be miserable trying to deal with the chills and the cold weather.
This group has been pretty helpful for me and I will definitely update with my progress! Thanks for all the love and support in advance!

Update:
Day 3 was kind of rough. Sleep was very minimal last night. I  took a double dose of sleep aid hoping it would help but made no difference. My back was bothering me more than my legs and I was sweating profusely. Got in bed around 11pm and woke up every 30-45 minutes to toss and turn and could not get comfortable until I got out of bed at 8 (couldn't take it anymore). My stomach was a little more upset and the restless legs are really starting to set in. Went with my wife to pick daughter up from school and went to the grocery store. Had to leave early cause I just couldn't take the chills and walking around everyone. Got home and we walked about a ⅓ mile and my legs are a little more sore now but hoping it will pass soon. I bought some magnesium tablets and iron vitamins to try and get myself back to normal and combat the restless legs. Almost caved and went to get kratom due to how bad I felt today but I overcame the temptation (for now) and hopefully we can make it through this time",4

Over this course of 6 weeks I went from not being able to move from pain to blacking out on various things because the withdrawal was so severe (I used an RC for a little while between quitting kratom and cold turkey, could've made things worse but since I used kratom for a couple of months I think this long term PAWS is the kratom) to being able to fall asleep naturally albeit without any restfulness, faithfully waking up at like 6 AM every day, started cooking three meals a day started smoking a lot more cannabis/taking dabs a lot more. For a little while I felt way too up, now I feel split between that and bleak. The PAWS symptoms that I have that I am amazed about because I am sure they didn't last this long coming off oxycodone or Suboxone OR methadone forreal: chills/goosebumps on the upper body. Sneezing. Restlessness (I had severe rls before I used kratom that was my medical excuse for taking kratom). Nausea. Cravings come and go for any substance that will sedate be it alcohol or an opiate... There was a phase of immense mental distress and being flooded with stressors that came and went. 

I just want to document again that kratom does cause severe cystic acne and a million other things I have in a long ass list I posted here before, looking at all the new scars on my back can't believe I did that to myself for such a subpar substance. The least they could do is find some way to clean kratom before offering it up for human consumption, it's dirtiness is how I presume it causes the cystic acne. But it clear as day was linked for me. As well, people say your pores look different. They actually did, now that my face looks normal again I can assure those people it will go away after stopping. I can't really describe how but it does change your facial appearance making it look more coarse less smooth, somehow. I just know I look way healthier now. Lost some weight, obviously kratom slows everything down undesirably so. 

Far as the other stuff like I mentioned on the list, the most prominent things that trail off when you stop will be chest pains that you definitely had but didn't pay enough attention to on the kratom or think it was the kratom doing it. Also, random nerve firing that hurts in fingers and toes. 

But wow I just broke 6 weeks off kratom dawg I was only on it the minority of a year maybe 3 months or something, my use did get very heavy like one time I accidentally used what was it a 60 gram container of red bali in like a day. Never forget something like that. That's the definition of chasing a high right there, just because the first time I used it it put me to sleep therefore it was good stuff. Shit was so narcotic, way too strong to be from a smoke shop word to salvia. But yeah 6 weeks today and my jackets zipped up about to hit up my slippers too. Arms are burning through the skin, legs can't help but dance an Irish jig. This cold from within needs real meditative energy control to get through, bros. 

Summary: shits been like running a marathon and when you really need a break the break is running another marathon, no breaks bitch. You feel the bass of the sound normalizing while you see someone sloooowly turning up the pitch of the treble (an acute level of overall difficulty that is more transcendent less you can feel) thinking they're getting away with it like you're not noticing. I want some sort of vacation I can't have right now. Gotdamn! Just know my body has never taxed me like this before. Fuck around and do the wrong thing, you shall not pass and shall be taxed.

Hoping that it gets better and better as the days go on, still prepared for the worst, but I’m starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, wishing y’all the best on sticking to it, no matter how hard it may be mentally, I was really getting to a point where my mind was convinced that I could never be without kratom, like I was stuck this way and doomed for eternity, well that’s not true, your mind will make you think that but it’s all a lie, we aren’t meant to live this way, life is meant to be enjoyed, of course there’s going to be ups and downs, but that’s life, and I’d rather deal with the stresses of life than numb myself to it, and I can finally see that now.

Hi everyone, just want to reupload my previous post with some update.
Still cant believe that I can do it after used kratom for 11years. It feels amazing to be free from kratom.

Want to share my early post about my wd symptoms. I just quit without any preparation of supplement. Luckily I found this subreddit around day 7 CT.

- Day 1 to 3, not very sick.. but trouble at sleep..
- Day 4 to 7 , the worst part in my life.. like im living in hell (rls, sneezing, not sleep at all for 7days, hot flash body, muscle cramps, anxiety, zero energy, diarrhea)
- Day 7 to 14, the worst is start to decrease day by day but the PAWS is coming i think  but thankfully i manage to hold and this subreddit play major role to motivated me.. start getting some sleep after I take BSO. And I don't remember what day I take magnesium and calcium.
- Day 14 to 21, the sickness will fade away & by day 21, i think i dont have body pain anymore, just psychological pain.

Update :

- Day 34, finally feel 90% normal. 
- Day 81, PAWS start hitting back because of covid 19 lockdown. Luckily I can hold it.
- Day 142, my daughter was born (best day of my life because she is the main reason I quit kratom)
- Day 200+/- , Get my normal life back. Free from kratom. Never ever thought about kratom anymore. The only thing i concern about is my weight gained 10kg now, i need to start healthy diet & more exercise.

Thanks everyone. Stay strong & keep fighting.",79

For almost 2 years I've been taking heavy doses of kratom. Wanted to quit after only a few months of using but the withdrawals scared the crap out of me. Talked to a doctor 2 weeks ago and got prescribed gabapentin and clonidine. 

The helper meds gave me the confidence I needed to quit CT. Ended up only using a fraction of the meds to sleep at night though. And just embraced the suck of withdrawals through the day. Honestly it was pretty horrible, but im on the other side now.

To anyone looking to quit, I really believe the anticipation of quitting is so much worse than the actual withdrawals. And that's coming from a very heavy user. It's going to suck, but its similar to a bad fever. I had Corona earlier this year, and honestly that was worse. Just believe in yourself, and evertime that fucking voice enters your head telling you to go buy some kratom. Just remind yourself why you made this choice. That you want to be free of this green powder.

I'm not out of the woods yet. Still have RLS but much more manageable now. As well as the cold sweats, and lethargy. And I know that PAWS is still in front of me. But thats fine. I made the first step and nothing can stop me now.

Going to hit the gym in a couple of hours for the first time since I quit. Should be interesting. Important question. Would squatting make my RLS worse, or provide some relief?

Thanks to this community, really thought I was the only one going through this for the longest time, and I felt like a freak. Wouldn't be here without all of you. Anyone looking to quit, feel free to message me if you need anything at all. Im ready to give back to this subreddit.",37

It's so nice to wake up in the morning and be excited about getting up, for reasons besides to take kratom so I could stop feeling like shit.

I'm so happy for and proud of all of you who are quitting now! It's worth it, I promise. Just take it a day at a time and don't look back. If anyone needs support, feel free to reach out to me. This sub was a huge support to me and I want to be the same for all of you!",21

Wanting to quit but scared.,"Hi guys, I've been popping into this forum here and there over the past year or so, but pretty sure this is my first time posting...

I've been using Kratom pretty heavily for about the past few 2 years and it's got to where I'm taking large amounts of it and not even getting much of an effect anymore...so i know I need to stop. I've quit for a few days here and there (I think 10 days was my longest) but I keep coming back to it because I feel like crap but have a lot going on that I want to be functioning at a high level for.

I've read many posts on here and the consensus seems to be it takes a long-ass time (I've seen up to a few years) to feel normal again - which is making me scared to commit to the quit.

My question is - does it always take that long for everybody? and if you have any tips about speeding up the process, please share.",12

Restless legs and no sleep last night but so much better than I had anticipated. Having experienced opiate withdrawals so many times before I had psyched myself up for the worst. 

Daily for the last 3+ years, I only got up to like maybe 15 gpd at the highest (I was lucky in that regard, usually it was around 10. I measured and tracked my use the entire time because of my history). I never really had a lot of the negative consequences, but I’m tired of being dependent. I would still experience similar opiate like withdrawals even on such a (relatively) low daily dose, and was so mad at myself for being physically dependent on something again after working so hard to free myself in years past. 

I was a IV heroin user for many years (skipped pills went straight for the hard stuff lol), did methadone on and off for a few months, drank to oblivion after that, then figured out pills were basically pharmaceutical heroin and did those for a couple years. Then of course suboxone! Miracle drug right?! (it did more than likely save my life at the time, but I then ended up using it as a maintenance drug for years).

I eventually was able to get totally sober off everything for a few years with only a few slip ups here and there but only a couple days so I didn’t develop a dependence again, but then I found kratom and...you know the rest. 

Kratom helped me in so many ways, I was able to move to in my career and come out of my shell after being awkwardly sober for a few years. And, like I said I didn’t have any of the negative consequences that I had with hard drugs. But it all boils down to my freedom at this point. I give thanks to this plant that helped me in a time of need, but it’s time to cut the cord.

Thanks to everyone in this sub for posting and helping me get over the hump. 

Now the actually hard part! Staying stopped. Wish me luck :)",13

I started taking kratom in mid Aug as an alternative to opiates (joke’s on me) after back surgery. I was previously clean and sober and in a program. I’ve been tapering from 30-40 god in September to 14gpd. I am stuck in my taper for almost 3 weeks and now Kratom seems to have taken a major turn on me. It’s got it‘a grips on me and the W/Ds are so severe. I am terrified. I’m also tracking each pill very closely now and it’s possible I was taking 2 or so extra and every pill counts now. I don’t know if I am just real sensitive to this stuff, or because of all the damage did before getting sober. I am reacting badly to this stuff now .Is it that the taper is catching up with me and it will get better? I’ve also been using ultra low dose naltrexone to help the taper and I think I now have a tolerance. Has anyone gone to suboxone from Kratom? I have taken sub before and it seemed at least more predictable than Kratom. It turns on a dime and I feel like my brain is on fire half the time. The anxiety is beyond what I can handle. I returned from medical leave to a very high pressure IT position with crazy deadlines. I am so terrified. I can’t function or think. My head is loopy and hurts all the time. This feels beyond my control to manage, and I don’t even have money to go to rehab because of all the medical debt. I just got sober one year ago and then I had to have emergency surgery and everything got fucked up. This is like a nightmare I cannot wake up from.

I’ve researched all my options and either switching to the lowest dose sub for the shortest time seems like the best option. I feel like I am failing at the taper now and I’m so scared. I also heard some use tramadol to taper from kratom. I don’t think my primary doc would be on board.

I have also been using ultra low dose naltrexone to help taper but I think my body is building a tolerance to that. I am so fucked.

Please help. This is my first experience with kratom and I just don’t know enough but I feel like I am in W/Ds with severe RLS and anxiety all the time. I am brought to my knees by this and cry almost around the clock. Thanks.",4

Still having my ups and downs, but overall starting to feel more “normal” for longer, each day. 

Sleep has been coming pretty easily to me these days. I still have a little bit of RLS so I’ve continued to take a magnesium supplement every night, smoke a little herb and it’s light out for me. 

I’ve always had VERY vivid dreams, I also used to have night terrors as a child. Lately, they’d been getting more and more intense. I have a sneaking suspicion this had a lot to do with the amount of stress and anxiety I currently have going on in my personal life, but either way they’re here and they’re WILD. 

Last night I had a dream I relapsed. It was so vivid. Like I could almost smell/taste the kratom I was taking. One big spoonful down the hatch. I remember “feeling like shit” even in the dream after taking it. I then remember feeling panicked and guilty, thinking about the month I threw down the drain and then I woke up. 

I had sweat through my shirt and sheets. I woke up frantic, feeling like I couldn’t breathe. Then the relief and realization that it was all a dream set in and YOU GUYS!!!! I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO THANKFUL. I am so glad I had that dream, it further solidified my choice to stay clean.

Happy to have 32 days down. Stay strong my friends. It gets easier. One day at a time.",8

At the time, I had graduated recently and was working my first job after college that I really loved. Working in a lab by myself. This will be the first of many jobs that I will get fired from in this time. I was engaged, had a nice townhouse, had everything I needed. When the pain settled in, which turned out to be a case of pudendal neuropathy, I was dumbstruck and could barely get out of b ed. Pain stabbing in my tailbone constantly and horrible ibs issues I won't get into. I went from happy to miserable within a month. I saw a series of doctors, but also during this time, I found kratom. 

Helped with the pain completely and eliminated stomach issues as long as I took my capsuled 5 grams three times a day before meals. Well over the next year, tolerance rose and my dosages increased. My anxiety got very bad. I discovered benzodiazepines. This was a huge mistake as I had zero self control with them. I would take some, blackout and end up taking a ridiculous amount and most people would pass out. But not me! I like to drive. Just randomly. Until I get pulled over. Over the next three years, I got charged with OVI five times, but thanks to a very expensive lawyer, only two stuck. Went to rehab twice. Was placed in drug court which I failed as I kept getting new charges. Lost my fiance and apartment. This whole time I went back on kratom even though my pain had been fixed after 1.5 years. My dosages got up to two ounces a day.

After my last OVI charge that stuck, I took my jail time of 7.5 months of hell. I got out clean though. Found an amazing new girlfriend and good jobs. But if course, got back on krato m and so did my girlfriend who was an ex heroin addict. Benzodiazepines quickly followed. But we were happy. Until I really became addicted to benzodiazepines and was losing job after job. My girl was addicted to krato m and also became very bitchy. I switched over to suboxone  about a year ago. About three months ago, I lost my job that she was driving me to because I wrecked another car. That was the last straw and she kicked me out. I got a shitty new apartment, but my parents stepped in because I was about to die or kill myself. They brought me to their house where I've been stuck for about 1.5 months.

 I went cold turkey off of suboxone but they had leftover meridian that they had confiscated years prior to help prevent seizures and taper me off of benzos. You think krato m withdrawals are bad, benzodiazepines withdrawals make me seriously suicidal. I'm still going through it. Last week I fucked up andbought 9ounces of kratom, which I went through in a week. And even though I was probably almost through shboxone withdrawals, krato m for just a week has made me sick as hell again. But today is day 3 without any and I have no money to get anymore. I am down from the equivalent of about 250-300mg valium a day to 10mg twice a day. It barely helps but I've made tremendous progress. But here I am still sick, hating myself for messing up the perfect relationship with a girl I loved so much, and no job, no car, a shitty apartment I share and basically no friends. So yeah, just those conditions can make someone suicidal alone. But I'm a fighter and I'm with you guys. I'll post some more lster, but I just wanted to give a rough background and let you all know that it could be worse.",8

This is the longest I’ve gone without dosing since at least two years, my habit was 20 to 30 GPD, nothing too crazy but it was a habit nonetheless. I’ve been wanting to quit for the longest time now but my mind always convinced me that I was in too deep and I didn’t have the strength to do it, but after lurking this sub for awhile now I finally have the confidence to take my life back.

Btw I really do think that the stars are aligning for me right now, I’ve been so worried about how I was gonna stop CT working a full time job, the RLS tends to keep me up all night and I work mornings, I just kept using and waiting for the right time to quit, We were all told that just for next week our hours are going to be cut, that left me with not having to go back into work until this Thursday. At first I was freaking out because of bills but then I tried to see the positive in the situation, that gives me a whole week to quit this stuff and get through whatever I have to!",7

First post here. 39 year old male.  I was a 30+ grams/day user for 4 years straight.  Some days, I probably took 50 or 60 grams per day.  I just got out of treatment for alcohol and kratom addiction.  I wanted to post here for the people just starting out and tell you all that at 46 days (with a 4 year daily habit), I am 90% recovered.  Waves of depression (usually at former dosing times) last 10 - 15 minutes instead of hours, my energy level is high enough to work out and not feel lethargic, testosterone levels are normal and as a result, I am able to lose weight like I could pre-kratom.

The hardest part for me was the first 2 weeks.  After that, it got better and better.  I have seen stories here where people say they are having PAWS 6 months to a year after quitting, but they are the exception and not the ""norm.""  If you can make it two weeks, you can make it a month, if you can make it a month, you can make it 45 days.  I think the people who have PAWS the longest also have a history of abusing SYNTHETIC opioids.  I do not say that to be condescending, it's just an observation I've made reading literally hundreds of posts.  Exercise (including weight training) will speed up the process of recovery and help with sleep deprivation.  Vitamins, water, and no aspartame are very important, in my opinion.

If you can get ""over the hill"" at 30-35 days, it's all down hill from there.",5

I drank alcohol during this withdrawal but it delayed my recovery so even now I really avoid that kind of drink.  I take tea and natural products like fruit juice ... It's crazy how the brain quickly gets used to living ""normally"" ... it's a pride for me not to consume anymore I am much more attentive  to my relatives and I save a lot of money which allows me to invest in things I like (I bought myself an iPhone12 with these savings lol).

Anyways they prescribed me x60 .1mg tabs. Given im waiting to hear back from the addiction specialist and this GP obviously doesn't know a ton about addiction medicine how much should I be taking? 

I dont have low BP in general, in fact its generally high, im an anxious person (half of what got me into this mess in the first place.

Won’t use gabapentin again unless RLS is a big issue.  Anxiety is a little bit up today.  Reached out to my NA sponsor today, awaiting his reply.  Life is fairly good to be honest.  I’ll roll back to posting here less frequently too but journaling my progress with posts seems to be helping me stay on course. Thanks for all the support!",3

Had my second session with my therapist today. Talking through why I started using and what it did for me, it seems likely I have been trying to self manage many ADHD symptoms I have had my entire adult life - such as need to multi-task, unable to sit still, constant racing random thoughts, etc. 

I scheduled an appointment with my doctor to go over and ADHD assessment I did and see what she thinks about possible medical treatment to try to get these symptoms under control - and combined with continued behavioral therapy, reduce the desire to want to use again in order to calm these symptoms down. 

I’ll report tomorrow how this goes. I’m off work until next Wed so doing my best to get a solid plan together that I can work and keep me on the right track.",5

I didn't pick up other substances to cope, I just sat with whatever discomfort came along, and allowed it to take its course. I went to therapy (I still go once a month) and have learned a great deal about myself, and why I run away from things, and to substances.

But all these words about me, they're also about you. You can also quit--not just kratom, but everything. If you are willing to put in the work, get the right help, and sit with the discomfort and pain that inevitably comes--you can do this.

Eased a bit day 3 and slept well that night. 


Came back day 4. Another bad night last night, RLS all night and today (day 5) it's still here, just as bad.

I tapered and have not really had any other major issues, some slight discomfort but nothing major. Still have lethargy but expected that.

Just what the hell do you think is going in with this RLS? I'm starting to wonder if I have some underlying condition that kratom was masking? But also recognise that could just be a bit of anxiety coming through.

Has anyone else had similar?

I know for a fact I'm not one of those lucky people who experiences no kratom withdrawals--I travel to the UK periodically (where it's illegal) and every time I go I feel like absolute shit the entire time, and look forward to getting back to America the whole time so I can dose again (yeah, pathetic).

Estimating that a heaping teaspoon is roughly 5 g, the ""steady state"" of my addiction was a roughly 50 GPD habit for about two years--wow!  As noted below I switched to capsules at the 3rd step of my taper to keep things consistent.

I'm at the last step of my three month-ish taper--ready to ""drop"" in a little less than two weeks.  My taper schedule has been as follows:

Two years (""steady state"" of my addiction) - 2 tsp/dose, 5 dose/day

One month - 1 tsp/dose, 5 dose/day

(switch to capsules)

Two weeks - 4 g/dose, 5 dose/day

Two weeks - 3 g/dose, 5 dose/day

Two weeks - 2 g/dose, 5 dose/day

Two weeks - 1 g/dose, 5 dose/day

Present (as of three days ago) - 0.5 g/dose, 5 dose/day

Plan on ""dropping off"" in ten days!

The taper experience feels like it will be a bulwark against a relapse.  Being at that 2 tsp dose for so long and experiencing first-hand how continuing to ""enjoy"" kratom is simply a losing proposition (it's just not within the reality of how the drug actually works), and progressively feeling better as I take less of the drug, I've very much internalized the fact that a life without kratom is better than a life with kratom, with no downside to slowly pushing the stuff out of my life.

The best thing for me has been the return of mood stability.  The less kratom I take, the more my moods are governed by the natural ups and downs of every day life--exercise, time with friends, an afternoon cup of tea, etc.--rather than a drug (okay fine technically a cup of tea is a ""drug"" but you know what I mean).

I could very well eat my words in two weeks when I finally ""drop off"" of what is currently, at this step of the taper, 2.5 GPD, but I'm optimistic!

I wonder if I could instill half the comfort and reassurance she gives me when she lets me hold onto her when the evening sadness hits. I wonder if I could listen and understand the year and a half of bottled emotions and communication that has come uncorked by this violent impact of quitting. I wonder if I would have the strength to watch my partner go through withdrawals and the trust to believe that this really is ""the last time"".

Like, I've used to be able to drink enough liquid morphine to kill a horse.  Have messed with fentanyl, benzos, norcos, etc etc.  You get it.  Like, as a poly substance abuser I would have withdrawals but it was usually just pretty shitty for a few days.  I was younger sure and would also like, get drunk to sleep and stuff like that, switch to another substance.  You know the drill.  


It's just.  The withdrawals I felt on Kratom are not even comparable.  They were worse than anything I've EVER experienced before, by a LONG shot.  Maybe because I wasn't using such high doses consistently with the other stuff because I was poor in those days?  I don't know.  They also lasted LONG.  Is it just cause I'm old and have developed such a habit?  


For Kratom quitters who are also substance abusers of opiates in particular:  How was your Kratom WD comparatively to whatever other opioid you have experience with and at what dosage did you CT?

I’m just not sure if everyone knows how bad it can get if you don’t pay attention to the warning signs.

I first heard of Kratom in 2013. I dabbled with it, but was only taking it in the recommended dosages, a few grams, so I didn’t really feel much. I didn’t seriously pick it up until about 2016. This is when I discovered that taking five grams or more would give me the “pain killer” feeling. I was only using the dry plant material during this period, but I got up to taking 30+ grams a day, in three 10 gram doses. This caused a lot of constipation and very bad bags under my eyes. I would have friends and family ask me if I had gotten a black eye.

At this point, I had tried the tinctures. The tinctures were obviously great but cost a lot. Non the less, I started only using the tinctures, as they didn’t have the same side effects as the plant material. This was around the beginning of 2019. I got up to taking four shots (the strong ones) of Kratom a day. Within this time, I started having, what I thought were, panic attacks. My heart would feel like it was going to explode. My heart rate would jump up to 120 for no reason. Long story short, I ended up in the emergency room on October 16th, 2020. Luckily nothing was wrong with me, but I did find that this is a common problem. It's actually how I found this group. If you search “Kratom Heart Attack,” this subreddit will pop up with many stories explain the same issue I had.

Please pay attention to your body. I don’t think there is enough research or experience yet, with this substance, to completely understand everything it does to the human body, but it’s not good if its abused, that’s for sure.

The first week going CT was hell. I felt off-balance, would get blurred vision, and extreme stomach aches. At about the seven-day mark, those irritabilities started to subside. I now feel completely different. The color has come back to my face, I’m happier and less irritable, my sex drive is back. I’m generally just better now.  **I will never use Kratom again**.",7

Quitting made me feel so many emotions I hadn’t felt in years on top of the falling in love. The anxiety I felt was also insane but I was just so motivated to keep moving to distract myself and with all the new energy I felt (plus not being able to sleep)!! 

The past few weeks have been tough. I’ve felt tired and bored and depressed and unmotivated, agitated and crying randomly (although obviously the election is coming and we’re all struggling rn). I kind of miss the drama of early withdrawal. I’m still really in love and grateful for my boyfriend and to have my life and health back, but I’m wondering if this is a common late PAWS experience or if I should consider medication for the depression and anxiety I self medicated with kratom in the first place.

Also anyone who’s reading this who’s thinking of quitting or early in your quit, stick with it! Being able to spend time with the people I love without this secret looming over me or worrying about my next fix has been such a gift. It’s really worth it.",5

You lived without it before and you can do it again. It's tough quitting, tough as anything in the world. It's going to suck, so damn hard. But you know what? That doesn't mean you can't. And it doesn't mean it's not worth it.

I started using kratom in college so I could stop using weed which I used so I could sleep after binging adderall and copious amounts of caffeine on the daily. For a while, it was something of a miracle for me. It was such a nice, soft, loving hug at night. It made everything okay when things sure as hell weren't. Soon it became my go-to for navigating anything tough in life. Collegiate sport practices, social anxiety, going to the gym, talking to girls, you name it. If I thought I had some kind of deficit going into any situation, I was tossing and washing kratom to make me feel better going into it. And for a very long time, the only consequences I faced were constipation and that wretched feeling of it coating the back of my throat if I didn't mix it well enough into hot water. Kratom made me sociable, it made me feel in control of my life, and it gave me the energy I needed throughout the day to tear through my exhaustive schedule.

After college, I got a job that had me waking up early in the morning, busting my ass physically at a job I quickly began to hate due to my horrible coworkers. Kratom let me bare my teeth and grin through the pain from 4am till 9pm. Id wake up, toss and wash with coffee and bust my ass till the afternoon. Boom, toss and wash again. From there I would handle my ""adulting."" Two more times in the day I would toss and wash before going to the gym and going to bed. For months it sustained me. But it slowly but surely lost its magic. I had to take more and more and soon all I was doing was staving off withdrawals. I developed terrible and debilitating back pain. I lost my job due to covid. And at this point kratom wasn't my super helper, it wasn't my friend, it was what it's always been. Just another draining vice that I used to deal with other negatives in my life. I spent hundreds of dollars and ruined relationships. The euphoria turned to constant anxiety. I planned my days around when I could stealthily take my ""tea."" I had to carefully order online planning for shipping lead times so that I wouldn't run out before my new shipment came in. I had to actually steal pills from my parents to stop withdrawing when the mail was delayed. Imagine that. Stealing opiates because I was withdrawing off the ""miracle cure"" for them. SO ironic, and so telling of just how deep I was in the mess that I was in.

I went from a teaspoon or two here and there to 30ish GPD over the course of 8 months and I sustained around that 30 GPD mark for another 6ish or so months. My back pain and crippling, newfound anxiety kept me out of work and kept me from genuinely living for months. It hurt to even lie in bed and my only salvation was my next glass of ""tea,"" but of course the relief I would feel was ever so fleeting. I was running out of hope and running out of any reason to bother trying anything.
I lurked here for a while as I am sure many of you also have. Other's posts before me helped me to formulate a tapering plan and actually gave me hope for the first time in a very long time. I'm hoping that maybe by sharing my story, I can help others too.

It took me over a month and a half with some hiccups along the way to drop from 30+GPD to 0 and I'm happy to say I'm well over three weeks clean. I don’t know if my taper plan will work for others like it has for me, but I had a very long look in the mirror one morning and help myself to 5g doses 3 times a day at 8 hour intervals. I used a scale and an excel chart to keep myself accountable and to track progress. Every 4 to 5 days I would drop by 1g until I got into lower doses Where I was dropping it by .5g. I'm sure many of you will be able to do it much faster but I was hampered by my ever-present debilitating back pain. Luckily I was able to approach my doctor about that and handle it separately. Side note: if you're having back pains, look to unlikely culprits such as your mattress. Turns out memory foam is not for everyone.

I'm not going to sugar coat it. Tapering was horrid. I spent so many hours laying in the living room begging for the time to take my tea would come. I would wake up hours before my morning dose time in agony wishing for anything, even death to give me relief. But death never came and every day, somehow, I would make it till the next dose time.

Anxiety is such a complex feeling, one that I have felt in many forms. But not like the anxiety that comes with quitting kratom. It absorbs you, it swallows you whole, and it dominates you. But eventually, it too fades. And slowly but surely, day after day, things get a little bit better. Feeling the anxiety ease up is very much a here and there thing and you have to celebrate even the tiniest victories. I would compare it to watching winter thaw into spring before eventually transitioning into summer. It is a journey and a brutal trek at that. But as you trudge through ice and sleet and snow, there are signs that give you hope. Like the first time going to the gym without it and even though you're so in your head and you feel like death itself must pity you, you somehow find yourself making it through a workout and it feels like the sight of crocuses popping through the snowbanks of early March. A glimmer of hope of the beauty of spring and life to come without kratom.
I'm now three weeks clean and the anxiety has all but dissipated. As has my back pain. I've slowly started to pick up the pieces of my life. I no longer have to fear visiting my parents and friends for periods of longer than the 4 hours I have before withdrawal symptoms start kicking in. I don’t have to keep a bag in my car. I don’t have to plan my day around when I'm going to re-dose. I'm no longer a slave to my addiction.

Take the first step. It’s incredible how the pieces of the puzzle of life begin to fall back together again once the fog has lifted and the chains around your body and mind have been unclasped. I am far from a religious person but the only thing I can compare this second chance in life to is rebirth. If you’re struggling, just know It can get better, and you have the power to quit. As I said at the very beginning of this post, you lived a life without kratom before and you can do it again. If you’re already on this sub, things probably aren’t going your way, so what do you have to lose. Short term pain is nothing compared to the lifetime of freedom that comes afterward. You can do this. I TRULY believe in everyone on this sub and will gladly offer what little advice and all the support I can to those struggling and wanting to quit. My dm’s are open.

2020-11-02 21:51:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jn2esi/quitting_kratom_suboxone_method_to_be_updated_in/,Quitting Kratom - Suboxone Method (to be updated in the comment section daily),"To start off, I am not requesting any negativity through this. I know the challenges that suboxone brings when trying to quit Kratom, and I have accepted those risks. I am going to be as avoidant as possible and I am working with medical professionals through all of this. Sorry it’s a long post, but I needed to get it out.

I know this method is undesirable and has received a lot of hate, but I decided to try it out of curiosity. I was desperate to quit to save my relationship and struggled with tapering. I was unable to take off work and needed *help*. 

First, I was taking Kratom for over two years. I started when I quit meth and needed something to make me feel good, essentially transferring one addiction for another. Throughout 2019 and 2020, my doses increased drastically. At my peak, I was taking about 60gpd. Starting in September, I went on a somewhat fast taper down to 25-30gpd by the end of October.

On October 28th, I took my last dose and met with my addiction specialist. She prescribed me Gabapentin for anxiety, along with a muscle relaxer and nausea medication. I had to go through 24-36 hours cold turkey before I could start my first dose of suboxone. She instructed me to take 2mg after I felt 4 or 5 symptoms of withdrawal with a minimum of 24 hours under my belt. After a painful 24 hours, I gave in and decided to take it:she told me to take about 8-16mg the first day, depending on how severe my symptoms were- starting at 2mg, and adding 2mg by the hour until I was symptom-free.

Note- the medicine she prescribed was:

Gabapentin- 300mg, 3x a day (I stayed on this for the entire time, even after I started subs)
Tizanidine- 4mg, 3x that first day (none after unless needed)
Ondanestron- 4mg, as needed for nausea 

OTC supplements I used through this whole process:

Black seed oil
NAC
Vitamin C 
Daily Vitamins
Magnesium 
CBD gummies (meh- prolly not legit tho, No THC in them Bc work drug tests)

**back to the story**

I took 2mg at 6:00am and went to the gym straight after, which ismy normal routine. I went from sleeping 1 hour, being in crippling pain with horrible restless legs and constant sweats (with diarrhea, of course) — to feeling just like normal. I didn’t take anymore subs until 6:00pm, when I took another 2mg. Gabapentin was helping tremendously. I slept like nothing happened, ever. I had 0 cravings for Kratom. I never really felt “high” and I was comfortable reducing my Gabapentin intake without any consequences. My doctor recommended me staying on higher doses of suboxone throughout this whole process, but I know that this would form a problem for me, so I made my own schedule to make sure I was done with it within 3 - 4 weeks.

This continued on the following schedule:
Day 1: 4.00mg
Day 2: 4.00 mg
Day 3: 4.00mg
Day 4: 3.50
Day 5: 3.50mg
Day 6: 3.00mg

~ will update post as i go down, quickly ~

Honestly, suboxone works. You have to have self-control, and remember that doctors do not always know what they are doing in regard to Kratom. I went through a problem in the summer of 2020. I didn’t tell my doctor I took Kratom back then and she prescribed naltrexone 25mg to help me quit smoking. I landed myself in the ER and in horrible precipitated withdrawals for 72 hours. My dumb ass kept taking Kratom praying that it would work and get me out of that hell. However, somewhere between day 3 and day 4, it did. And it became the same addiction that it was before, like I never skipped a beat. This scarred me mentally, and made me scared of quitting cold turkey. I couldn’t put myself to do it again, that 24 hours before suboxone was like reliving trauma, to a much lesser degree. Funny bit,  I did quit smoking cold turkey in September :) 

I want to applaud anyone who quit Kratom cold turkey. I am proud of you, so so much. I’m not writing this to try and sway the conversation towards Suboxone. In fact, I understand why it would not work for most people. Everyone has different strengths. You all are amazing people and are SO much stronger than you think. We can all beat this beast, it’s great to have a support group. I wish you all the best in your journeys, and if anyone ever wants to ask me questions or for advice— slide into my DMs!  This isn’t nearly over for me but I will continually update this post on how I am doing and how challenging this process is.

One thing that I think is really going to help is that I've portioned out my doses for the next 5 days into baggies. I've also put away all Kratom-related stuff where I can't see it.

So today marks 201 days since I broke the habit. Jumped off CT at 150+ gpd, using for 7 years, with multiple quits thrown in there ranging anywhere from 5 months to 5 days. This is the longest I’ve gone without and am so happy to have made it! 

Still wouldn’t say I’m completely back to normal, but please, don’t let that discourage any of you contemplating quitting/I’m the middle of a taper/in the early stages of WDs. I was using for a fairly long time at way too high of a dose. Besides, I have to admit, I’m feeling pretty damn good these days. 

PAWS was never too big of an issue for me. A couple days here and there with bad depression/anxiety. The only problem I really had was lethargy, but those days where I find it difficult to find the motivation to get up and going are become less and less, and it’s making me feel more like a “person”. 

Kratom is more of a passing thought for me anymore. The only time I really do think about it is when I visit this sub. Cravings will still pop up at times, but the thought vanishes just as quickly as it comes. 

Seems like right around the time I hit the 6 month mark is where my hair stopped falling out at an uncomfortable rate. It never came out in clumps like I’ve read in this sub, but enough to concern me (can’t help it, I like my hair). 

I’ve also been completely sober for the past 5ish months, excluding caffeine and nicotine. This is the longest I have been sober for since I was probably a teenager. Had a few drinks one night and woke up the next morning with a crazy amount of anxiety, and decided it was probably for the best to avoid all substances for the time being. 

Main point of this post is for those that think they can’t quit, IT IS POSSIBLE! I was an absolute slave kratom and at times thought I’d never be able to stay quit. Feels like something finally clicked in my brain, and I’m ready to be done this time for good. I owe a ton of that to this sub that has helped keep my motivated, informed, and inspired.

I can power through, but it is hard and I feel like I am just waiting on the day where the pain gets too bad and I feel like I need to dose again.  

I came up with a pain plan but sometimes it seems futile.  I am 31 and have sciatica, occipital neuralgia, low back and rib pain, lots of nerve damage, knee and ankle pain, and sinus pain almost all the time.

2020-11-02 13:40:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jmtema/day_3_of_taper/,Day 3 of taper,"I started my taper on Friday. Been using Kratom on and off for roughly two years, but the Pandemic really transformed this casual pick-me-up into a full-fledged addiction. I went from using 4 grams per serving maybe twice a day to 180 grams daily. 

I knew something was wrong when I found myself shifting my lifestyle in order to afford the beverage. At first, I'd run out and just feel bored, or uninspired, but around two weeks ago, I ran out and literally felt like I had a mild case of the flu. I knew it was the drink because it all disappeared when I finally got my hands on some more. It was time to stop. I begrudgingly tried quitting CT twice, but the same flu-like symptoms appeared whenever I tried, and I ultimately caved—call me weak-willed if you want, but I totally wasn't prepared for withdrawals like this. 

I don't hate the drink, but the vendors I purchased from gave little-to-no information regarding the drink's addictive properties, but it's my fault for not researching the drink more. I got into it during my nootropic phase and mixed Green with modafinil on a regular basis; it's a miracle that I didn't experience any seizures with how much I was abusing both drugs.

Anyway, here I am. Day 3 of a taper I started on Friday. I went from 180 grams to only 16 grams daily, which was dumb but I started before finding this subreddit and figure I'll keep with it since I've already experienced the shock of the drop and know what to expect (plus it'll make the taper shorter and get me my life back faster). 

I don't know why I felt led to write out my experience, but I think this subreddit is a beautiful thing and am extremely thankful to have a resource like this. Kratom helped me out during the worst year of my life, but it also took me to an extremely dark place, and I'm ready to be free. Thank you all for making it possible for me to have hope.",3

I am going to try a brief workout later today, I have done so for the past two days.  Appetite is better, but not fully back yet.  I’m hoping sleep returns soon.  Tried melatonin last night.  How soon is too soon to try Benadryl if I’m still struggling with mild RLS?",4

1-14 days - The first 2 weeks were the worst for acute withdrawals.  Sleep was nearly non existent and was definitely the worse part. 

15-21 days -  I kinda thought I was over it, other than being a little tired and demotivated.  All in all a decent week although sleep was still not ideal

22-26 days -  PAWS grabbed me by the balls and dragged me into a deep depression.   The anhedonia, demotivation and constant negative thoughts had me glued to bed.  These were by far the hardest mental days of the journey so far.

27-30 days - I feel ok, still a bit tired and demotivated but I'm able to force myself to exercise and do normal things.  I have spurts of joy and motivation but they are short lived so I have to force myself to keep chugging along.

On Day 1 I read a post titled DAY 30! and I didn't think I would ever make it, so if you are reading my post thinking the same thing, you definitely will.  Looking back, the acutes were the easy part of quitting although I thought it was unbearable at the time.  Its the mental part that requires you to dig deep and remember why you are doing this in the first place.  I look forward to doing another update in 30 days.  From what I read on here,  people really seem to feel good after 60 days.  

Keep up the good fight everyone!",23

I really need to quit.  I'm up to 60+ gpd split across doses every 4 hrs and been a daily user for \~2 years.   I'm very impulsive and lack will power.  I've always had to CT everything I've wanted to quit.  I've tried tapering a few times and failed.  So I'm going to CT.  I work in a high tech field in sales engineering so I interact with customers and teammates all the time.  I can't be in a terrible mood or dragging butt while at work.  Based on reading posts on here, it seems that folks with my usage history have very rough first week when going CT.  So I'm thinking I need to take a week off of work to quit.  But there always seems to be something I need to be ""up"" for within the span of a week.  I've planned it for past few weeks but something has always come up.  I'm shooting for the week of 11/16 now, but I'm afraid something will come up again.  I'm not going to stop trying and I'm going to make it an even high priority,  but I'm wondering if I really need to take a week off of work?

It’s been a little while since I’ve posted, but things are still going very well. I’m dropping to 6 gpd this week, and during this time I’ve cut out dairy (I’ve been vegetarian about a year) and have really tried to cut back on beer. I figure that since I’m making such a big change with Kratom, now is the time to make some other changes in my life. I’ve mentioned this in a previous post, but I’ve noticed since cutting back on K other drugs have started to affect me more strongly. A combination of drinking less Kratom, which means I’m less constipated, and the fact that drinking beer always gives me the “beer shits” has really made me rethink even moderate beer consumption for the time being. It’s just absolutely killing my stomach. I’m happy I never picked up smoking or vaping, as I feel that people lean into these activities when stopping another drug. Good luck to all of you!",8

-minor sweats upon waking this morning
-uncomfortable sweats at gym
-one weird sweat episode after my morning coffee

-firm poops, but dosing Metamucil 3x a day

-feeling lethargic, but once I get going I do pretty well.

-RLS last night.  Slept 5-6 hours though.

-anxiety is slightly elevated, so is depression, but the anxiety is less than when I was on k.

-appetite is pretty poor.  Trying to eat Whole Foods, plenty of fruits and veggies.

Kratom served its purpose for me and than it left me trying to chase a feeling I couldn’t get again. But once I got over withdrawal I realized how angry and agitated it makes me. It’s probably the main reason I fight constantly with my mom but I started noticing the simplest things She would do would set me off and I’d be thinking so negatively about her, and full of hatred and resentment for what she has done to me in the past. For example, we were eating dinner and she was telling me about a movie, but she was so bad at telling the story and was stalling and pausing so much it drove me insane, whilst she was butchering the movie description she was chewing loud as fuck with her mouth open and it was driving me even more up a fucking wall. After she was done she sat on the couch and farted loud as fuck and I lost my cool and started screaming at her for being gross while people were eating dinner......this isn’t who I am. I’m the most laid back easy going person and things like these don’t even phase me normally. I do have a lot of anger towards my mom from things in our past but i don’t normally feel this hostile towards her. 
Moral of this story, this is just yet another reason I hate kratom and a reminder to stay clean and sober from the K. Still though, I know I’m right about chewing with your mouth open and farting at the dinner table....",6

Just needing a quick vent and wanting to reach out to the community. I understand that I need to be patient with this. Years of abuse will not be solved within a couple weeks of sobriety.

First off, what a crazy trip this has been!  This is the 3rd time I quit kratom and this time was by far the hardest.  But here I am now on day 26 CT from a habit that was out of control.  I don't really know how much I was taking at the end, but it was a TON.  I am so incredibly happy to be free of this substance and back to normal finally I can't put it into words.  From where I am right now to where I was 26 days ago feels like another planet.  Even though it is day 26 I still have some remnant withdrawals here and there. I still sneeze randomly throughout the day.  I still get hot flashes every now and then, but this morning I feel AMAZING and know my system feels more alive than ever and all that crap is finally really out of my body.  Every day I've felt it lessen and as I come back to life, it simply feels awesome.

I didn't post much throughout my quitting process because I've been insanely busy with work and a million different things, but I just wanted to confirm I am finally free of this drug and I will NEVER go back on kratom.  I took kratom for 11 out of 16 months of getting sober from alcohol and all other drugs on July 25th, 2019.  I hate to say it, but part of me feels like I am at least grateful that it helped me not drink/do other drugs for all that time because I used it as a replacement.  I didn't need alcohol or other drugs because I was using it as a substitute.  And it makes me wonder if I would've stayed sober had I not used it for the past 16 months.  Anyhow, I am just grateful to be sober for the first time in my life and I cherish it more than ever.

This past quit was very painful because I had piriformis syndrome and when I quit my muscles in my butt, hips, and sciatica was so inflamed I couldn't even lay down and avoid the pain.  I took 5 days off work and was bed ridden the entire time with hot/cold flashes, physical muscular pain, and just total lethargy.  I felt braindead.  I don't normally watch tv, but I watched hours and hours of tv because that was the only thing I could do.

Looking back on the time I spent on this drug I realize I was in a kratom brain fog.  It was like I only had access to 40% of my mental capacity or something.  I was not myself and I was stifled in every way possible.  My day centered around dosing and I was a slave to this drug.  I am so thankful to have myself back again and to finally feel amazing.

If you are thinking about quitting and afraid to do it, just do it.  It's worth it.  Claim your life back from kratom.  It will steal so much from you.  Do you want to look back someday when you're old and remember all the years you spent wasted being lost in this substance or do you want to look back and remember how you freed yourself of this poison and went on to do amazing things with your life?   I choose the latter.  I can't wait to see what I achieve and who I can become now that I am finally free of all these substances that once robbed me of my life.  Self mastery is my goal today.  My hope for a wonderful life is at an all time high now.

Much love y'all. Stay strong.  You can do it.  We got this!",23

You can do it taper-ers!!!,"I started trying to taper from 15gpd at the start of September. Due to excuses I made to myself I basically abandoned my taper towards the end of September. Started again at start of October. 3 doses, reduced each one by 0.5g a week. Got down to 1g doses (so 3gpd) last Weds and flipped out again. I had lots of family stuff going on and made excuses to myself ""I don't want to spoil this"", ""I don't want to be thinking about kratom"" etc so dosed all over the place from 1g to 3g for 3 days.

Realised I needed to get on top of this so stopped Saturday. Sunday morning now. Virtually no WD symptoms, just a bit of watery eyes and achey legs this morning.


Just wanted my fellow taper-ers to know: if you fall off your taper, get back on it! You can do it! You can make it without WDs as long as you keep going!

The future looks bright.",5

I have heard Gabapentin really helps and I have access to some. I’m just curious about how I should be taking it, and if it really does help.

I believe one pill is 300mg, would taking 1 a day help? I know you have to start out at the lowest dose and work your way up. I only plan to take it for a week but if I can keep it at the lowest dose possible while still getting help from it that would be preferable.

Thanks in advance!",1
