Im new to reddit. And i decided to join after seeing so much effing support on this hellish topic: ""Quitting Kratom."" Well, ill tell you a little bit of my story of this green nasty sludge. Back in 2014, I had an incident, where i broke my femur, and as well as 17 parts of shattered bones in my right leg. I was put on oxycodone at the highest dose. And gabapentin mixed in with the combo. I became addicted. And in 2017.. i jumped the habit. Well, my friend reccomended Kratom to ease the W/D and pain. Said it was all natural and there were no negatives about it. I was skeptical at first, but than, i decided- why not? Well, that why not became into a 25 to 30 gram a day habit. And now, it has taken over my life. Every thing i do, i mentally and physically have to depend on this bullshit plant. To the point, whereas affecting my marriage and the time i have to spend with my precious 2 boys. I have tried to quit, literally 2 days ago.. and didnt even make it 5 hours! Because the chills, the restless legs, the extra strange mucous/saliva, the cold sweats, runny nose..etc. i just want my life back. i just want my natural happiness back. Please.. is there anyone out there,  that can relate and has had success in quitting this bullshit. Or is in the process of quitting. good or bad. Would love to hear your stories. Your pain. Your heartbreak and success. Well,  that is just the jist of my misery at the moment lol. Hope all is well, during these crazy fucking times.  Stay safe, stay healthy. And most importantly,  much love y'all! And Thank you for reading this!",4

I've quit before, so I know what's about to come.

I have struggled with kratom dependency for years and I thought I'd share something that helped me stop kratom as well as the addictive behavior. I would strongly suggest reading or listening to the power of now by eckhart tolle while you're stuck at home. It's hard to kick any bad habit that's had a grip on you for a long time. But most of the suffering we go through is self inflicted and psychological. That is the most important battle you need to be fighting, or rather not fighting. To stop being a slave to your mind and it's endless thought loops and patterns will not only give you freedom from kratom, but also any needless suffering in your life. Use this time to meditate and really watch your mind. Don't label or judge your thoughts, just watch them. If you're feeling bad from withdrawals, don't tell yourself that you feel bad. Just accept it and go with the flow. It will pass like most things in life. Just have faith",17

He was going to quit CT over a span of four days but we decided that with him starting a new job today that tapering off of it would be best instead. He’s taking about half a cup of Green Vietnam three times a day currently.  Before he was taking about a cup to a cup and a half two to three times a day. With all of this corona virus craziness going on, I’m worried that his immune system will be weak from tapering off of it because he’s been hooked on it for three years and if he catches the virus that he will have a hard time fighting it. Is that something I need to worry about?? Please help a worried wife!!!!",4
2020-03-30 12:58:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fruiyr/dont_make_this_mistake/,DON'T MAKE this MISTAKE!!,"For those that are planning on quitting, or are in the process of, the one thing that will make you spiral is if you do not have an end date to quit. I tapered to a teaspoon a day, sometimes two, and expected my body to tell me when I could just stop taking it. Wrong. Because as long as you take the plant, you're going to have days of lows and highs, because of how your body adjusts to its tolerance levels. My body adapted to the low dose, but then I took it for too long at that level and I would feel bad again after hours after dosing. Just like if I were to quit CT, I'd feel shitty because of that too. So make sure to have an end date,  otherwise without that structure and discipline, you WILL take more, you WILL increase your dose, and you WILL take steps back that you were doing so well at. Also, kratom does cause hair loss, there might not be enough scientific studies proving this,  but I would bet my life on it, as I'm an example of it.",6

2020-03-30 12:27:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/frty6p/taper_question/,Taper Question,"This is not my first time quitting Kratom. I briefly quit for two months last summer, but then I injured my hand and started taking Kratom again instead of painkillers. From August 2019 until now I've been taking probably 4-5 spoonfuls a day, so what is that 25-35gpd?

Like last time, I've recently noticed I have no motivation in life. I do not find joy from things like I used to. I am content just working all day on Kratom, then coming home and laying about at night and on weekends. I used to have all of the energy in the world, now I just don't care. I quit smoking 127 days ago and quit alcohol 30 days ago. Kratom seems like the logical next step.

I made the decision this past weekend to use the quarantine work-from-home time to kick the habit again. I took my last dose on Friday afternoon and then went the weekend cold turkey. Saturday wasn't bad, more anxiety than anything, but the withdrawals started to creep in Sunday. I was freezing cold but sweating, restless legs,etc.

This morning I woke up in full blown W/D's. Chills/Sweats/RLS/Stomach issues/etc. I cannot afford to be off my game at work and realized going completely cold turkey was stupid. So here is my question:

Is it better to:

1. Make a taper schedule with measured amounts taken at scheduled times and just step down over the next few weeks, or
2. Just take a spoonful whenever the withdrawals become too much/uncomfortable and see how it goes?

I remember reading somewhere in the past that #2 was a stupid way to go, but I cannot remember why.

I appreciate all advice/responses.",1
2020-03-30 11:10:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/frsj4d/3_month_update_candida_overgrowth_after_quitting/,3 month update + Candida Overgrowth after quitting,"Hey everyone! I haven't posted on here in about a month so I figured I should come back with an update. I quit after a looooong taper on 12/24/2019 so I am currently just over the three month mark with no relapses. Because I did such a long taper, I had almost no acute withdrawals and was honestly just really excited to be clean and start seeing the benefits of quitting. In my four years of use I quit a couple times and saw huge improvements in my skin and digestion but never quit for more than a week or two. This time around was a totally different story. After the first 2-3 weeks of being clean my health, physical wellbeing, and appearance actually declined dramatically - just as I thought it should be getting better. I did have some anxiety/anhedonia/depression from PAWS but it was much more than that. I was in constant pain all over my body, both just achey and seemed to injure myself extremely easily. I was extremely, extremely, fatigued and could sleep 14+ hours a night with no avail. I had this weird fuzzy/pressure feeling in my head that I never had quitting before, ringing ears, swollen glands everywhere, skin was flushed, my veins all over my body became extremely blue and visible at all times (my friends told me I looked like I was dying). On top of that my digestion became WORSE than it was on kratom. I literally couldn't button any pants I owned because I was so bloated all the time. I also gained 15 pounds even though I was working out and eating cleaner food than I was on kratom. I also had horrible oral thrush that just wouldn't go away. I couldn't brush my teeth without my tongue bleeding and without almost throwing up. During this time my heart was absolutely insane as well. I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest 24/7 and I am almost positive I had an irregular heartbeat several times (and this was true even when I was just laying in bed). Lastly, I developed the craziest acne on my face and back. I had cystic pimples everywhere (which I had had before) but also had hundreds of these tiny skin colored itchy bumps all over my face and arms. All of these symptoms were new as of quitting kratom and only continued to get worse the longer I was clean. I actually felt like I was dying every single day and could barely function. 

Finally, at the 2.5 month mark, I realized that something else was probably wrong. I couldn't find anyone who got such horrible physical symptoms after quitting that only got worse even months out. I researched a lot of my symptoms/talked to two doctors and discovered that I likely have a systematic candida overgrowth. I started a anti candida diet 5 weeks ago and started taking anti fungals/other supplements that go with the candida protocol about 3 weeks ago (you can google it if you want more details). Though I still have a long way to go on the candida protocol, I for the first time can say that I actually feel physically okay after quitting kratom. I am no longer bloating, digestion is slowly getting better not worse, I am no longer in constant pain, my veins have gotten slightly less noticeable, my ears don't ring, my head doesn't feel fuzzy/heavy, my tongue doesn't bleed anymore, I don't gag brushing my teeth, I don't need 14 hours of sleep now, I don't notice my heart constantly and can even drink caffeine now etc... I could go on forever. Not only that, but my anxiety is completely gone. Like literally just dropped off. Again, I still have a long way to go but I am so happy that my health is no longer declining and that I figured out what was wrong. 

Anyway, my main point of this post is that I full heartedly believe that quitting kratom ramped up my candida overgrowth. Obviously quitting kratom didn't cause it, but none of the symptoms listed above were there before I quit (even when I was tapering) and they all developed/worsened very slowly as more time passed after I quit. There was nothing in my life at or even remotely around the time I quit kratom that could have contributed to a candida overgrowth. I don't eat sugar or dairy, didn't take antibiotics, didn't start a new birth control, etc... I also know that kratom is antimicrobial, so I think it is possible that I had an existing candida imbalance but that taking kratom throughout the day kept it in check enough that symptoms didn't develop. On top of that, though I wasn't experiencing any of the physical symptoms described above while I was on kratom, I could have had the brain fog and fatigue and the effects of kratom were masking it. However it happened, I know that as soon as I quit kratom I became extremely physically unhealthy and developed a severe candida overgrowth. My point of posting this is to encourage people to listen to their bodies! I wish that I had investigated possible other causes for my symptoms earlier rather than attributing them to PAWS or more long term withdrawal. I also just wanted this to serve as a reminder that kratom can cover up other physical ailments while your taking it, so it is always possible that quitting will reveal a health problem that you weren't previously aware of. I am not encouraging everyone to run to the doctor if you are having physical symptoms even weeks after quitting, but if it has been more than a month and a half and you are still getting WORSE all around then maybe start with a google search. It was extremely terrifying and discouraging to watch my health and my appearance decline so rapidly after working so hard to quit kratom for the sake of my health. I am so grateful that I didn't decide to give up and just go back to kratom either. I will post again with an update as I get farther along in the candida protocal but I am definitely feeling much better in a lot of ways an feeling hopeful. Also let me know if anyone else experienced this after quitting and what you did about it. I hope everyone's quits are going better than mine was and that you can hold onto hope for the future even if you feel awful right now - it will definitely be worth it!!",21

I told the nurse that I take Kratom but when she went to input it she said it was not in their system, so I am thinking that the hospital staff may not know very much about it. Has anyone here experienced something like this? 

A few symptoms to be more specific:

* Used to happen only at night, now it is 24/7 but far far worse at night

* Trouble beginning urination, trouble stopping, weak stream, dripping afterwards.

* Burning and pain in lower left abdomen when urinating

* After urination at night, symptoms persist for hours

* Cold sweats, shaking, and numbness in extremities, new symptom and has only been around 2 days

* Noises/feelings like your stomach growling but lower down your abdomen

Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

It's my 20th day after receiving Ibogaine treatment in Mexico.  I didn't have a transcendent, introspective experience like I've heard from many people, however, the Ibogaine did help TREMENDOUSLY with the withdrawals.  That being said, I DID have withdrawals.  It was really weird.  On the plane ride back to North Carolina from Mexico, I experienced the worst withdrawals I had ever experienced (this on a 5 hour plane ride).  The withdrawals lasted about 24 hours, and then they subsided.  Since then, I've still experienced some withdrawal symptoms (restless legs and sleepless nights), however, they are much more manageable than I've experienced in the past when going cold turkey.  I know this because I tried to go cold turkey last year, and I lasted about 9 days.  The depression and long days were the worst part.

I feel more confident than ever that this is the time I stay sober.  In addition to the Kratom, I was also addicted to amphetamines.  As it stands today, I've been clean from amphetamines for 34 days, and clean from Kratom for 20 days.  I wish everyone the best out there.  You CAN do this!  Your life does get better.  I feel so full of hope and life, I can barely sit still.

Please forgive me as I quote ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (which I've been addicted to the past couple of weeks).  ""Hope is a good thing; maybe the best of things...and no good thing ever dies""",2

I saw someone else on here say Magnesium helped (calming magnesium), so there's that too. Good luck, and good health to you all!!

I’m very excited I found this sub. I’m going to share some information about my life and habits in the hopes I can get some help here. Despite being young I’ve found relative success in my work life, I’m the Head Of Customer Acquisition for a biotech company, primarily working with hemp. I’ve always been a hard worker, my friends, co-workers, and strangers consider me charismatic, outgoing, and completely together. However at home, I’m a different person. I began secretly struggling with opiates after I damaged my back and a few disks in a car accident when I was 17. As I began healing from this accident I was prescribed tramadol. When I first started taking it I was shocked by the pain relief I received. I felt clear and motivated, excited about each day. It was a complete 180 from the sleepless nights and deep aches I was told would be apart of my daily life for the rest of my life. I’m a voracious researcher and reader, so immediately I wanted to know why this medication worked so well. As I became more informed I slipped into abuse, wanting to receive the pain relief and energy without the antidepressant properties of the drug. I began utilizing the medication to receive certain social advantages, and at home comfort. My father was a doctor and had a cache of medication at home I’d never considered, but I began raiding it for any opiates I could get my hands on as I would often run out of my medication before my next refill. Oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine and marijuana became a secret part of my daily life. After about two years I went CT while on a trip to upstate New York where I knew I’d have no access to any kind of intoxicating substance. The withdrawal was horrendous, but I managed to kick opiates for a year before discovering Kratom. It was like a gift from God when I first tried it in a Kava Bar, that familiar feeling I had become so familiar with returned, provided by a legal green powder from across the ocean. It’s been a year and some change and in that time I’ve developed the habit of taking about an ounce of Kratom a week to stave off the persistent pain I’m in. I see it as a better alternative to other opiates and even marijuana. However, I wonder what kind of damage I might be doing to the receptors in my brain, my liver, and my health in general. Whenever I wake up in the mornings I’m drained, cloudy, and racked with pain. I have to pound a water bottle filled with Kratom to get my day going. At night I take it to help settle my body so that I can sleep. I take a little here and there during the day as I notice my pain returning. I’ve began to notice that when I don’t take it I become extremely restless, anxious, and agitated. It’s now almost impossible to become the motivated. witty, and charismatic guy I’m required to be naturally. Without Kratom I feel drained, bored, and am in horrendous pain. I don’t want to keep taking it without knowing what it’s doing to me, but I fear returning to a routine filled with discomfort, lethargy, and pain. I also don’t want to start taking other opiates again. What should I do????",9

It was great.  I took it for work and before I went to the gym and it was amazingly helpful.  It also helped me get my diet in check because I wasn’t really hungry.  I magically had the energy to keep up with my toddler.  But now it seems to be working against me and I am constantly chasing a better feeling by tossing powder.  I am up to an obscene amount every day, prob 80-100 grams a day if I’m being honest.  It’s embarrassing.  I have an old creatine container full sitting on top of the fridge and I just toss and grab a seltzer out of the fridge constantly.   I can’t drag myself out of bed in the morning without it and I wake up going through withdrawals.

Yesterday”but made it through. 

I posted this last night but here in an update~ 

Today 3/27/2020 above text, last night below.

I actually felt way better today then yesterday. More energy today.

How is everyone doing today? I made it over the first hump and had a flatline kind of day. The 5-10 day stage of coming off K is full of emotions returning, sobering consciousness, extreme pain, Depression, Anxiety, out of control digestive issues, sleepless, nights, RLS, Guilt, you name it! The one Positive is the moment you have an awesome laugh and go.... WOW!! I have not experienced joy and meant it in awhile or heard a song and actually FELT it. We all notice different things and have different levels of WD. Everyday has been getting better however today I hit my first little plateau. Breaking the mental habit in my head, whispers, and Super low energy. I’m also stressed like everyone else about the C19! I am an essential worker so I have to work and am very grateful to do so. I was all Germaphobe’d out today and paranoid. I literally have to take a walk outside to my truck like every hour or so for fresh air. Feels like the walls are closing (Anxiety is much better) but still present. I kind of thought to myself this is kind of why I started taking K in the first place to always be the top guy and have tons of energy. Kratom also numbed me so well and the first year using it I had really no Anxiety at all and could get through work. It also made me have a big appetite. I had that moment of well.... I still have a long road ahead of me. 1. If I could ask someone who has been off the Green sludge longer than I “what has worked for you? What new Habits/Discipline now help you stay off K? I feel like I am experienced enough with addiction to know that once “THE NEW STAGE” where you feel high, from not getting high! Hope everyone is staying safe and having this outlet is a new way I can stay accountable to my new QK Fam! Hope tomorrow is a better day took some CBD Gummies and appreciating Ganja again. Eventually I would love to be 💯 Clean, but that is a scary thought as well. Kava Kava does help a little with the anxiety it calms me down. I also went and got Magnesium, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, Water, and healthy foods. No Alcohol right now just makes me feel down. My body has felt funky too stomach wise. Pounding heart as well. Anyone know of the changes and chemistry going on inside the the human body while coming of K besides the outside?  Hope to have one of those UP days tomorrow. I try to remain Positive. Here is too Living Life. My craving went away and my kids and being home brought me happiness immediately :) I feel so much more connected to them. Have a great weekend ✨",4

I've had episodes of panic attack-like stages for days before after quiting kratom and not having access to any bensos at the time made me scared shitless that it would ever happen again. After that I always have 2-3mg of xanax in my drawer for the ""just in case"" situation which has not occured since thankfully. I can leave it there for months without taking any so I don't consider it a problem for me.

This and the thinking that I will quit kratom even tho I have access to it in front of my nose at all times just to say extra fuck you to kratom led me to keep 50g of kratom in my drawer. Now 3 weeks in I wonder what you think of this? Is it my addictive brain talking to me to keep it? I know I can get a hold of kratom shiped in about 24h, is there any differense? What do you guys think I should do? Ps I am from Sweden and we have no IRL shops with kratom that I know of so I order from either a Swedish online shop about 200gs or from the Netherlands in 1-2KGs at the time. Money differense and all. Probably why I always end up taking so much. Having 2-3kg kratom at the table in front of you makes it pretty easy to dose.... All the time... I DO NOT want to take kratom now. Absolutely not. But in a few months I have no idea.

Off Kratom = Nothing is stopping me from speaking my mind and standing up for myself; I am confident enough to apply for new jobs while being sensible about understanding my current boss is just a human like me; desire and confidence to message women on dating apps and Facebook, just for the conversation (we are locked down in my state); desire to work out.",2

Yesterday was rough. I normally take giant spoonfuls of this crap all throughout the day to keep me going, whereas I only had three half-spoons yesterday, with as much time between doses as I could withstand. I would re-dose when withdrawal symptoms would arise... Feeling cold af, aches, super runny nose, restless legs, social irritability, not being able to feel comfortable, etc. I did not feel any kind of buzz yesterday, whatsoever... I took the bare minimum that I feel I can take to get by for right now.

It was a difficult and frustrating day, to say the least.

For the time being, I'm a delivery driver and dealing with customers yesterday was rough. My anxiety was fucked, also feeling completely scatterbrained. I fucked up one good time and forgot to put a customers ticket on the make line after I took his order and the look he gave me about ten minutes later when he came back to pick up his food was enough for me to fully grasp the situation. 

After my shift, I was growing irritated and the WD symptoms were obviously present, yet again. My gf and I got into an argument after we got the kids to bed because she ran to the store and I had asked her to pick up a couple tall cans to get me through the night... she comes home with the brew but we manage to reason. Ultimately, I agree that I should continue to ween myself and around 10:00p, I take my third and last half-spoon dose to rid the symptoms. To summarize, I couldn't get comfortable at all and I finally fell asleep a little after 3AM to wake only a few hours later, riddled with these same dreadful symptoms. I took a small dose this morning a little after I woke but this shit SUCKS and I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

We're both off work today and it feels great outside so that's how I plan to spend the day with the fam but Idk how to deal and I'm only trying to take one more dose today and I might just get drunk tonight so I can skip the pain and actually sleep.",2

I didn’t want my son to see that behavior and emulate it, my time seemed better spent on more productive pursuits, and I needed to be conscious and present in the world around me with this new life about to be in mine. But what I didn’t give any serious consideration to was kicking my kratom addiction. What irony; a full blown addict sanctimoniously swearing off social media so as to set a good example and be present for his son while still taking a drug all day every day for years. How’s that for flawed addict logic?

Kratom helped me quit drinking starting New Years 2019 but even after a year of being mostly sober from alcohol, I still have considerable brain fog, anxiety, bad memory, and an overall numbness of emotions. So I'm blaming the kratom for that, especially after finding this subreddit, and I'm going to quit April 1st, in 5 days.

Just seeking some recommendations for supplements people think might help. So far I'm looking at Ashwaganda, Nigella Sativa, Magnesium, Fish Oil and I've got some Phenibut just in case. Any suggestions are appreciated. (Yes, I am aware of the supplement section in the wiki)

Im also introducing myself here to get to know some people, to create a little bit of accountability and support. I plan on writing about my experience everyday for the first week or 2, like many others here do. Anyways, Please let me know which supplements I really should have on hand before taking the dive.

Will the anxiety at least gone down at all anytime soon, or will I probably be this way for weeks? I swear mine hasn't gone down since day 2, and its really getting to me. I really want to give up and order kratom and try tapering, but I also hate the stuff now because of how uncomfortable this has been. Everyone else on here says that it gets easier, but I swear this is getting harder everyday because my anxiety will not go down at all. I got my doctor to prescribe me some hydroxyzine for the anxiety which allowed me to calm down last night for a few hours so I could finally get some sleep, but today feels just as bad as yesterday, and everyday before it.

Even just river water running and the beauty of it is amazing to me now. Had a bout of PAWS at 2 weeks CT that lasted about 5 days. Have had some days where I’m more grumpy and patience has ran lower some days bc of having my 5 year old home every day so that has been a challenge. I am more patient with him though without kratom and I do a lot more with him. I’m more interactive, caring, and fun. My body performs amazingly well again during workouts and MTBing. I’m happy to have me back. I still think about it here and there but it really seems to be a thing of the past for me now. I know now that I cannot ever take it again and I’m totally ok with that.

I used about 3-5 grams per day (once a day), usually twice a week, for the better part of the past 3 years. 

After almost a month of escaping from a pretty low dosage addiction, it’s still as though my brain is screaming out, expecting, it’s fix.   My head gets flush, I can feel my body temperature rise a bit, and my anxiety increases.   This is not a psychological withdrawal symptom.   It is most definitely a physical manifestation of my brain’s need and expectation for its “fix”, even after a month.   I know some people only experience a few days worth of physical withdrawal symptoms but I feel there are many people out there, including myself, where it will take a lot longer.   All of our brains are wired differently, and I suppose some of us unlucky ones are more prone to addiction at even very low levels of any insidious drugs.  

I’ve found only one sure fire way to alleviate it.   Exercise!!!!!!   I can’t stress the need for that enough for anyone trying to quit.  It’s absolutely essential.   Infinitely better than any substance to help the withdrawal or supplements.    

I hope this very uncomfortable sensation abates soon.  And I wish all of you out there much love and support during your difficult and incredible brave journey.   It’s surely worth it!!!!!

During that time I continued to use Kratom (along with cold medicine, nasal decongestant, aspirin, etc.) and noticed the Kratom did not work nearly as well if at all. Some of the research I have done seems to point to it not working as well while the body is fighting off and infection or sickness. As I look to quitting I know that I usually get sick during this time and if that does happen I may just pull the plug on Kratom while fighting the cold or flu. I wanted to see if anyone else had done this or how Kratom reacts with you when you got sick if you still took it. I know after my 7 year habit I’m in for at least a rough month. I’m starting to map everything out and unfortunately the Coronavirus Pandemic is hampering some of my plan, namely getting back to the gym. I do have alternatives however and once I decide to quit for good I will try and post the first day and maybe a few more with my experience.

I have been using Kratom heavily on and off for about 3 1/2 years. I've definitely found a decent amount of benefit from it but this last year It has gotten extremely out of hand. It's always helped me with my extreme ADHD, depression, anxiety and RLS but you can probably tell with all of those things that it's attempting to fix how many w/d symptoms I get when I stop. I can deal with the depression and anxiety to a point but the RLS is unbearable and I can not focus on anything for more than 10 seconds. So the negatives have started to outweigh the positives for me.

I also unfortunately vape... A lot. I've started an incredibly slow taper which I plan to take about a year. Just going at my own pace so that I can still function. I started about 2 months ago and it's been going generally well. Cutting almost 1/3 of my dose at this point. Now this is where Vaping and nicotine come in. 

I've always known Nicotine diminishes the longevity of a Kratom dose, but I've just realized how harmful it has actually been to my taper. Because not only does it reduce how long my doses last but it also sparks premature rls for me hours before my next dose. 

I've recently started to significantly reduce my nicotine consumption by vaping no nicotine juices and only using nicotine juice when I absolutely can't take it. I know I really should just quit, and I will get there because I find that period of time becoming greater and greater. I also know myself well and am trying to not give myself to great of a task at anyone time. I'm allowing myself to take baby steps. 

With this all said, the significant reduction in nicotine has allowed me to almost double the speed of my taper for the last week, which I am incredibly excited and happy about.

So I apologise for the long post but I wanted to share my experience about how harmful nicotine can be when trying to taper or quit Kratom. 

Thanks for such a cool sub,
Cheers!",4

I've been an extremely heavy Kratom user for a little over 2 years. I am starting to finally realizing I am hitting rock bottom. I can even get it up even if I wanted to, my motivation to exercise (K use to help with this) is nonexistent, I'm starting to not eat as much, and my relationships are taking it's toll as a result.

I have decided on 5 separate occasions that ""today is the day to quit"", and I never make it. The psychological impact this drug has taken on me is something I personally have never experienced. Unless I am on Kratom, it is literally the only thing I think about all day, everyday, and it's driving me insane. 

With this quarantine, I feel now is the time when I need to stop, as it's getting harder and harder to even get. I am just on here looking for tips, help, and I guess motivation. Clearly it's impossible for me to quit cold turkey, so I guess I am just looking for some kind of guidance, as I don't know what I am doing.

So...yeah, turns out I’m an addict. Or had at least developed a pretty solid dependency. I had no problem quitting alcohol when my ex recognized he’s an alcoholic. I stopped with him. I thought it would be hard because I was a daily drinker. Not a heavy one, but a “Hey, it’s whiskey o’clock!” every evening one. And for the first few weeks I drank tea instead, simply because I missed the fidget of reaching for my drink. But I felt so much better, unexpectedly (because after that many years I didn’t realize how shitty even moderate drinking was making me feel), that I didn’t miss the alcohol at all. I actually sort of have a mild aversion to it now.
But...I’d been using kratom daily for a year by then and I didn’t stop. I have bipolar disorder and fibromyalgia, and kratom helps the symptoms of both of those better than any of the pharmaceuticals I’m on. And I wasn’t a heavy user. But hey...there’s a pandemic, I have no income for the foreseeable future, I’m not going to be able to buy it, might as well start weaning down. And by weaning I mean stop taking it except for a tiny bit (like maybe .5g) in the morning and evening the past few days. Tonight I’m skipping the evening dose. And I’m doing ok but I’m noticing the things. Sweating while the AC is on. Freezing out in the hot sun. Super short temper.
And the pooping. I’m not even gonna try to be dainty here. Yesterday I pooped several times..which was a miracle because I was constantly constipated. Yaaay, things are getting back on track! 
It was a lot. I was kind of horrified to see what (and how much of it) had been just sitting there in my body. And it’s weird, because I’m thin. Like 5’3, 112lbs. My stomach is flat, where was it all hiding? But ok, intestines are long, glad that was all out. But TODAY. Today...I lost count. And it’s not the runs. It’s still really solid, rather painfully so...and justsofuckingmuch!!!!!! And I have a feeling there might be more tomorrow. I don’t know how many more rabbits are in this hat, kids. What the actual fuck?! How have I not died?!? And I was a light user.
Right now I have a weird metallic taste in my mouth..it’s similar to the taste after I toss and wash, almost like I miss that horrible, lovely bitterness. Is that a thing?
I know none of this is new, but thanks for letting me get that out. (I said to my toilet today.) Sorry..I’m serious though. It took a fucking pandemic (which took a member of my family a week ago) and the fact that I can’t afford to buy it, to make me stop poisoning my body.",11

I would take my kava with kratom everyday. After a while, I stopped taking kava but the kratom just stuck. This is when I started to get really bad anxiety that the kratom would either help or make worse. This slowly started to form into a depressive like state because why should you do anything if it makes you anxious. I struggled with this anxiety inducing depressing for about two years. Do I know if kratom was the root of all of this? No, but I felt like I needed it there because the WD was so uncomfortable. About three months ago I started to look for ways to help with my anxiety. I was already meditating, but it was not helping too much. I would lose focus and start thinking about situations that never happened. I needed to learn how to be in control of my thoughts, but I had nothing to help direct my thoughts. I began reading books to help fix my anxiety. I would read and read looking for a cure. I never found it in the books, but I did find something else. I found a passion for reading. I started to notice that rather than cringing and panicking about nothing. I would focus on the books I was reading. My anxiety slowly went away. As of now I barely get any anxiety. If I do, it is for a logical reason or I can use some trivial techniques to reduce it. Now back to kratom. I don’t need it now. I have found happiness in something else. Something that makes me feel good without having it control me. Taking kratom has been a roller coaster experience that for now has reached it ends. I make take it again in the future, but for at least now I am ready to continue my journey with a book in hand rather than a teaspoon of kratom.",1

I was a 40-50gpd user for abt 4 months. I used it to get off of benzos which was complete hell for a month or two. I was led to believe that this ""miraculous plant"" was free from any drawbacks and blah blah blah.. After waking up one morning, I felt something very familiar. It was opiate withdrawal!! Now, being an ex opiate addict, I'm VERY familiar with what withdrawal feels like :D So, another fuxking dependence right? At this point I was more than ready to quit, but how? We all know how difficult this can be, but all is not lost friends! I tapered from 50gpd to 8gpd in a week (thanks to my girlfriend!) Sure it was hell, but I'm here as living proof that it can be done. Abt 2 weeks of tapering from 8gpd I made it to 3-4gpd and just took the jump. Being very familiar with withdrawals of ALL sorts, I feel that I can say goodbye and good riddance to the new devil's lettuce. I wanted to thank this sub-reddit for helping me get this far and would like to say how possible this is. Don't syke yourself out friends, just get work done!",33

Just wanted to check in with anyone out there who is looking to quit a high gpd habit. 36 hours in and I was honestly expecting a lot worse. Last night was kinda hellish and I broke down crying but today I feel really good all things considered. Still kinda feel like I have the worst flu of my life and the rls hasn't been great but my mental state is noticeably optimistic today. Been taking black seed oil, agmatine, 30mg dxm, melatonin as needed, magnesium, ibuprofen. Also was prescribed some klonopin and my girlfriend has been administering it once at bedtime. I honestly dont know how I'd be doing without her here. Managed to get a few interrupted hours of sleep last night because the rls was still pretty awful even with the benzo but its noticeably improved today. 

I definitely should have tapered but I needed to be done with it.

Last 2 it was 24/7 with around 15-25 gpd. 1 year and 1.5 months ago I got sober from a 6 year drug and alcohol habit so it sucks to be there again. 

Compared to quitting weed/speed/alcohol/pills these 48 hours have been pretty easy but it still sucks. I’m so mad I naively believed all the “kratom is a miracle sent from god” people that dragged me into this. 

I have a RLS-diagnose since before I’ve tried drugs since I got it from my mom but this past 2 days it’s been off the roof. Tried to sleep for 5 hours before I finally fell asleep due to RLS. My anxiety have been worse than usual and the world is a bit more gray now.

But I know I’m going to get through this, I’ve done this before and can do it again! 

Anyone have a tips against RLS that’s not moving your legs? it’s so bad I feel it in my arms, mostly around the shoulders and it drives me crazy. 

Hope you all have a wonderful day and stay strong friends!",8

It has been a hell of a ride. This time I started taking tramadol, sub and oxys for a couple of months and then returned to kratom and using for like 4-5months or so. Started kratom at around 30-40gpd and last 2 months were 70-80gpd or a little over 2kgs/month. Tapered for 2 weeks down to 25-30gpd and jumped on March 4th. 

First two weeks of CT I used everything I could get my hands on to escape the withdrawal. Amhetamine, heavy rc benzo for night, alcohol and weed. During week 3 I was so out of it, zonked out just trying to get thru the day. Today as in last day of week 3 I acutally feel good! I remember this from last withdrawal and I think (hope) my pink cloud period had come. It was so awesome last time...! I still use weed for sleep and some afternoons to get my mind off of things but I'll try to stop using until I get to week 4. Weed was never addictive for me. Can have some in my drawer for half a year without using any.

TLDR: I'm not 100% but I would say 70%! My confidense has returned, I joke with people, I dance randomly while listening to music, I laugh all the time!! Damn it I have missed this... People at work things I met a girl because I am so positive and have so much energy compared to before. :D My addicted self seem so... Lifeless, dull and uninteresting.

I m a kratom user since Jan 2018. For the past year, I had a stressful period bartending (6 days a week cuz I work in Asia- Feb 2019-Feb 2020), in October I had one episode of gastritis that felt to be enlarged spleen but had since resolved.

I was drinking 6 days a week on the job. Now no longer. I don’t know if my cysts are caused by alcohol withdrawal, or poor blood circulation (because I recently have also occasional on and off chest pain, left respiratory depression, left brain fog, ITCHY SKIN ESP. The back. I feel like prescriptions that I use have not been helping either. I take stilnox, zopiclone and quetiapine also. Quetiapine I have discontinued because the new generics I have got have really given me heart palpitations but it’s weird bc I never have that for the numbers of years I had quetiapine before.. I use these pills for my chronic conditions of bone spurs which are mostly concentrated on anterior cervical spine on LEFT. LIke behind the left tip of my hyoid bone. The upper ones are bothering me. 

It’s really ironic because I started kratom use bc of my neck conditions but now I don’t know how to quit it and it has been affecting my health and possibly worsening and complicating my conditions. And it can’t be coming at a worse time with Coronavirus as I’m just too worried to visit the doctors office although i really wanna have my blood work done",2

But I’m trying something different so I’ll suspend my judgement of myself and start with the obligatory background. It’s 1am and I’ve just completed my second day(a sleepless 48 hours) of cold turkey after at least four years of daily kratom use. I’ve had only two isolated days in that time where I chose not to take any, and one period where I was in another country and was forced to go without for three days because I couldn’t find any, and believe me I looked. I suppose I want to discuss my disbelief and perhaps confess in a sense. I can’t believe how terrible I feel. I can’t believe how much money I’ve spent. I can’t believe the time I’ve wasted. I can’t believe how much of life I’ve organized around this habit. I can’t believe how embarrassed and ashamed I am for becoming so shockingly addicted. And on and on. I’m in a state of utter disbelief, and obviously have been for a long time if I could ignore all the problems surrounding my habit as though I didn’t believe any of them to be real, destructive, or so obvious. I don’t allow myself to look in a mirror any longer than necessary because I don’t believe what I see, and haven’t for a couple years now. I haven’t gotten a “high” off this shit for years at this point; 60-80 grams per day as maintenance is so unbelievably pointless. I have no sex drive or social life, yet a beautiful wife and longtime circle of close friends and family, all of whom I lie to so easily and with such regularity I’m hardly aware of it. I easily lose site of goals and achieve little and let people down, though I told myself I started taking kratom to get things done. And most importantly, I cannot believe I thought that all that shit I wrote above was better than dealing with this withdrawal I’m in now. I have diarrhea, nonstop sneezing, can’t sleep, my body aches and tingles, I have cold sweats, irritability, all the symptoms with which you’re all too familiar. And those symptoms, as awful as they are, seem pretty fucking manageable compared to all the problems, stress, and heartache I’ve managed for four years just to keep kratom in my system and easily accessible. If I had never taken this or any drug, and you asked me if I’d rather be sick and depressed and exhausted for a few weeks or months, or deal with all the problems I’ve regularly caused over this addiction(that I can even remember) there’s no question I’d choose this withdrawal over all the rest. I just can’t believe what I’ve traded for such a shitty escape for so long. Thanks for reading. I don’t need tons of validating or encouragement, just the outlet.",39

I have been using kratom everyday, never taking break days, for about 3 and a half years now. My dosage is between 16 - 18 grams per day. On saturday 3/21/2020 I cut my dosage down to 8 grams and felt a little uncomfortable but nothing to bad. Sunday, I took 6 grams of kratom three times throughout the day and felt somewhat normal until the night came. My last dose on sunday was around 9:30 pm and at 2 am (I stay up pretty late) I started the have this controllable desire to stay awake. It eventually turned into my heart pounding and unable to stop moving my legs. At around 8:30 am I took 2 grams because I know I was going to need to sleep. I eventually passed out and woke up around 1pm. I have not taken a dose yet since waking up and don't feel that bad actually but maybe thinking the 2 mg dose is still in my system not allowing me to WD. Does anyone have any advice for sleeping? I take melatonin but I did nothing for me last night. I took 10 mg and still could not fall asleep. Any help would be much appreciated.",1

I am adding in just enough to feel a little better to work. 

I am noticing I am very irritable. 
I am annoyed as hell. When my phone rings. 

I am trying to work. Yet my dad my friend my sister. 

All feel they need to call while I am working. 

I usually have patience with this , but damn. ... I mean I am 42 I have had the same good job for 7 years. 

I care for my child, I own my home... why do they feel the need to call and check  on me all the damn time! 

They have no clue I have been tapering. 

All is as normal in their eyes.  

God.   I see my phone blowing up 9am it’s my dad. 

I talk to my dad all the time it’s not like he never sees or talk to me. 

I have told him time and time again. When I am working I can’t be on the phone shooting the shit. 

So I didn’t pick up. About 30 mins later I texted “I  working very busy is all ok? “.  He replies “ just checking”.     Wtf why? 

I haven’t left my house , I don’t have the coronavirus... checking on me why? Shit causes me anxiety.",2
2020-03-23 09:22:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fnjvh6/five_weeks/,Five weeks,"Five weeks in as of this morning.

Shit's a bit rough I won't lie. Vacation got basically ruined by the outbreak, got locked down in europe and then had to scramble to get home paying upwards of $2K just to fly home early, no refunds for any of the stuff we had already paid for and didn't end up using of course. Got home just in time as the airlines are shutting down. By the time we get home the state is on soft lockdown and now we are in quarantine for 2 wks having travelled internationally.

So stuck at the house, no way to go out even to get groceries let alone a fix, which is good. Loving friends went out and got groceries. Survivable, but shit the loneliness and tedium and isolation are such a huge trigger its not even funny. That and the constant 24/7 stream of steadily worsening news being fed into our domes by the internet. All of this results in a massive craving i wont lie, if I could do so without endangering other peoples lives i might actually crack, but that's not even an option, so no fucking way. Oh and I quit fucking smoking tobacco too mostly out of fear for my life. Which right now isn't helping my mental state at all because I keep mentally reaching for crutches that aren't there. Just having to learn to exist again and find the inner strength to deal with things without the substance crutches is a continual challenge. i just keep thinking of something my mom told me a long time ago when i was trying to quit smoking for like the 100th time (she smoked 40 yrs and finally quit, quit booze too so she knows a thing or two)

She told me ""When you have a craving just remember this. In a little while the craving will be gone, whether you give in to it or not.""

And she's right, though I hate to admit it sometimes.

It's very interesting though, even fascinating, this whole outbreak and what it is going to do to us as individuals and as a society. I curse the fortune cookie that I once opened and is now coming true: ""May you live in extraordinary times.""  I truly believe that this is the most extraordinary time ever to be alive, we are about to witness something that is absolutely unprecedented perhaps in all of human history. Not that there haven't been pandemics in the past but the degree of connectedness that we have now both physically and electronically means that this thing has spread around the globe in record time and is going to be meticulously and excruciatingly documented every step of the way. And the way it has disrupted to global economy and global supply chains, things are happening which were just unimaginable even a few months ago. And in the meantime we get to be on house arrest more or less and have lots of time to sit around and think.

So instead of sitting here and contemplating endlessly the tidal wave of tragedy bearing down on us, I feel that I should count my blessings.

\-I am still healthy. My family is still healthy.

\-There is food, there are clothes and shelter, there is electricity, heat, and water

\-There is still internet, for the moment

\-I have a lovely partner for this exercise in isolation

\-We have a home gym (this is huge)

\-We have friends and family who love us even though we can't hug them right now we can still connect in other ways.

\- Netflix and chill

\-We have like, a shitload of weed gummies that our friends gave us, so even though we don't want to smoke any flower right now we can still eat gummies if we want to. it does seem to help with sleep somewhat but damn it i wish i liked weed more... i used to love it long ago and now it just makes that hamster wheel in my head worse. i guess this is why i got hooked on the K - it was like a temporary reprieve from the hamster wheel.

So I'll be here, in this comfortable prison, keeping my fingers crossed that I stay healthy. Wishing you all the same. Please be careful out there, distance yourself as much as possible, stay healthy, wash your fucking hands. Much love.",1
2020-03-23 09:12:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fnjqku/my_experience_with_kratom_withdrawal_vs_alcohol/,My experience with kratom withdrawal (vs alcohol withdrawal),"Firstly  I know that alcohol is more damaging to the body and and generally a harder drug. But what I found was that Kratom had a much more protracted ""withdrawal' than with the booze.

I was up to around a litre a day or the equivalent and have self 'detoxed' many times. Shaking at work, VERY occasionally had to go back to sink a beer or two. This wasn't often tho and usually was when I wasn't eating. To taper off, I went through my tried and tested process: Get through the day, try to stomach a supermarket pizza, have a bath and sip on beers till the shakes go away. Sometimes have a few sips of vodka. I actually have some fond memories of these times. Gradually reduce.

After a max of 3-4 days I was over alcohol even at 35-40  units a day for months.

Kratom, I felt great, lost weight looked better when off the booze. But this shit is insidious when you're addicted to it. When speaking, sometimes I couldn't find the words I wanted to get out. I felt like an idiot sometimes. Well I'm already an idiot, lets say more of an idiot. I liked the mild buzz and the lack of a hangover and was also combining with large doses of phenibut. I had a similar albeit lesser effect from alcohol, but I was drinking large amounts and was often hungerover/in acute withdrawal. With kratom it was much more functional (as you might imagine as it's not a hard drug), but there something I didn't like.

So quit. No big deal, just a few sniffles here and there. But it was hard, much harder than quitting booze. 'Quitting' as in no longer being physically dependent. Going from 50g to 15g or so was pretty easy. But when I got to the 5g a day stage, I always woke up with this intense craving that I never got from equivalent doses of alcohol. I can't describe it very well. It's like a feeling in a chest, a restlessness. It took me at least a week at literally 1-2G a day to be able to kick it. The standard opioid stuff - the sweats and cold, that was easy, but there's something else in here that makes it somewhat difficult and not to trifled with. I think there's SSNI effects and who what going on.

The fact that I could quit booze as a fairly heavy alcoholic at least for some time (factoring in kindling) and have a tough time with this means it's not to trifled with if you're taking it every day. Maybe I'm a pussy and don't know about hard opioid withdrawal, but I've gone through alcohol withdrawal (including hallucinosis) and 'they' say it's the worst withdrawal so take from that what you will.

Phenibut on the other hand was really weird. No withdrawals at all after 4+ grams a day for several months. Only after 4 days or so did I get cravings (physical stuff?) but no big deal compared to kratom. I imagine a lot of this is psychological, same as nictoine.",3

(Suboxone),"So a question on quitting due to this unique timing. So I’ve withdrawn from suboxone, like 8mg a day for a year cold turkey, could anyone guess as to how bad WD from 10g of kratom a day will be for about the same time. Suboxone wd is beyond heinous, and I know the PAWS is lengthy for Kratom too as it effects multiple receptor sites. I just want to be prepared, should get some stronger comfort meds (benzos). I’m taking a guess here and saying every few G’s of kratom is equal to 1mg of suboxone so I’m gonna have a pretty shitty time, but not be dying.",2

It's been going pretty well, until last week. Due to the virus situation, I got nervous and ordered a large amount from an online retailer instead of getting smaller amount from my local smoke shop.

I thought this would be fine since the strain was the same (red maeng da), but after taking a normal dose of the online stuff, I felt way more impacted then more normal dose.

Due to the quarantine, I messed up a little and took more then I should of, and noticed for the last two mornings, I've woken up with the familiar jittery, uncomfortable feeling that had mostly gone away when taking the smoke shop variety, and made me have to take a small amount in the morning (which I had stopped), just to get ready for work.

Is this a known thing? Are some brands stronger then others, even if the strain is the same? I notice I can take the smoke shop variety and not go into withdrawals, but also feel mostly satisfied. Going to try to not buy any more online after this, and warning others it might cause a set back to change vendors during a taper.",1

I have been through quite a journey with kratom,  and substance abuse in general.  Regarding kratom,  I have read so many of your posts, all of which are responsible in part for that 95 number.  I have posted some which I hope have helped others. Kratom is not, and never will be my friend.

We are all living in bizarro world with this COVID-19 thing.  I am in New York, which is getting hit hard. Basically, we are all shutting down and isolating.  Closing up shop, and staying as far away from each other as we can.

I am suddenly wanting kratom.  Why this week?  Why now as I am approaching 100 days?

It dawned on me that this environment of isolation forced on us by government (right or wrong, but probably right) is similar in many ways to the environment of isolation formerly imposed on my world by kratom.  That was the world I craved.  Present, but not connecting.  Working, but not contributing. Conversational, but not immersed.

So COVID-19 is creating a sort of cocoon.   I am learning to live without the cocoon created by substances, especially kratom. 

But here is my honest situation.   I feel justified to use kratom- maybe due to this isolation reminding me of the world kratom used to make for me?

Guys, I wont do it!  If you want to make sure I dont by calling me a jackass if I do, I'll take that kick in the pants gladly.  But I wont.

I wrote all that to say my brain almost had me.  After 95 days, I still think like an addict (duh).

I say often things like ""stay vigilant "".  I am learning that is not all internal willpower.   We have to be aware of how our environment is shaping our thought process, and how our kratom brain will deceive us.

Hope this helps someone,  writing it set me straight.

Trial 5..,"This is my 5th time quitting kratom.. and I am sick of it.. along with the quarantine, it was a wonderful time to quit. I have an odd system for quitting. I like video games and anime and a bunch of different mediums of entertainment. I, however, refuse to let myself play certain games or watch certain shows I like while on kratom.. because I feel it taints the experience. I am not sure how to explain it.. but today animal crossing came out on the switch... I was literally so excited, that I quit kratom. Because I refuse to play such an organically happy and fun game while drugged up. Maybe it’s weird, but if something is like innocent or happy, like certain music, I won’t let myself do it on kratom. Anyways, the point of this post is that I had preordered this game the day I quit kratom. I told myself I couldn’t preorder it unless I quit. I was excited. Ebullient. I was up all last night waiting for midnight so I could play this game because it released at midnight.. then midnight came.. then 1am.. until 7am.. and I never even turned my system on. The malaise, dysphoria, apathy, all of it has been so bad these couple days that I didn’t even have the strength of will to play. I twitched again last night (RLS)... I felt so disheartened...
Fast forward to an hour ago.. I said fine. I will just watch the intro.. and I immediately felt happiness bubbles that burst into a smile. A smile. An actual, honest to god, organic smile. For some reason I able to feel happiness, but my body can’t tell that something will make me smile. 
I don’t know how to describe my feeling.. a feeling that my mind says “nah you don’t have to do that now”, yet when I do it I DO enjoy it. I am happy I forced myself to play this. Is this normal? I feel like this time is harder than other times I’ve quit. My gpd every other time was about 15. It was about 40 this time, and one that was much more potent. The alkaline concentration was huge on my last kilo or so. 
Just thought I would share.. plus if anyone else bought animal crossing hit me up.",2

I’m on my 3rd week of tracking my intake. Taking 12.8 GPD spread out over 5 doses. Just making sure I stay consistent. Very little (if any) side effects as I was maybe taking between 15-20 GPD for about a year before realizing I was addicted. 
My plan is to officially start the taper process on Monday and every couple of days just drop .8 grams. (1 capsule = .8 grams) 
I have a scale and some supplements I’m taking throughout this process, but would love some advice if anyone has any. I’m an athlete and can’t afford to go through 2 weeks of WD’s so I’m trying to taper to get off this stuff as smooth as possible. Very disappointed with myself for letting it get to this point but I know one day I’ll look back and be thankful for these trials.

I don't want to supplement anything. Currently taking only multivitamine, Omega 3, Ashwagandha, Maca and DAA. Searching for natural forms to recovery.. excercise, set and get the goals, relationship, meditate, eat well...  and maybe **masturbate sometimes**.. because I am single now.

So tired of trying to catch that buzz one last time. Tired of the constipation (and thinking that fiber will cure me, when it’s 100% caused my kratom) this stuff is so disgusting. My biggest obstacle when quitting was getting through work, but thanks to this pandemic I don’t have to worry about that right now. I’m taking it very seriously, but it’s a blessing in disguise.

I'm not sure the dosage but I go through an 8 ounce bag within 5 weeks. I think my body has become very dependent on kratom because when I try to stop taking it, within hours of the first day I start to feel the stress and it causes me to feel like i'm losing control and about to panic... I just shutdown mentally and isolate myself and i'm left unable to function at all, like simple things, chores or going out anywhere. Since the coronavirus has been killing people and continues to spread leaving us with limited supplies, quitting kratom would burden my family as I would need extra help with things. I know my dependency is bad because when I wake up, it's alot earlier than usual now, I wake up with a runny/stuffy nose, watery eyes, sneezing that will wake me up in the morning as i'm asleep (I was dead asleep and some sensation hit me and i woke and and sneezed and continued to sneeze about 32 times for a few minutes, and thats how that morning started. Once I took kratom, that all went away), soon I become anxious (even though I take 3mg - 4mg Klonopin daily + 1g - 1.5g Phenibut) and that's when I panic and see the only relief from the sickening panic feeling with the cold/flu like symptoms is a glass of kratom. Only when I take kratom am I able to feel productive and normal (for 3-4 hours), unless I take adderall. 

I'm also a daily herb toker and I also feel sick if I don't consume it regularly. I'm trying to knock down Kratom, Phenibut/Weed usage as well as reduce other dosage intakes. But my main goal is kratom currently. 

I hear that during withdrawal, you're immune system is very weak and you become susceptible to illness. Being that there's a coronavirus epidemic in my area (Northern VA/DC) I think the best option would be to continue to take it but taper down because I may have to go to jail in June, and I cannot be dependent on substances like kratom and all others. I have 14 0.1mg Clonidine tablets and I'm thinking DXM/Antihistamines may help with tapering, but when should I use the clonidine during the withdrawal, as seeing first hand how harsh day 1 is on myself, I couldn't imagine day 3-5... I was on kratom for about 1 year regularly now, but from Jan 2020 - Feb 2020 I was on Percocet and Vicodin prescribed for my back pain, and I managed to swap back to kratom off the percocet but now i'm stuck in the Kratom mud. I need advice if anyone can help please! What should i do, I have to do a substance abuse treatment class for court soon, but do i tell my doctor or the Substance abuse treatment doctor first. My doctor is unaware of kratom/phenibut consumtion. I'm hopeless! :(",3

So if you can imagine now this thing called Kratom not only helped me get of and STAY clean it also brought joy into my life for about a year. It was a God send at the moment. Yet now that I have set my mind so strongly on that kratom is the saving grace I shouldn't ever really get off. But after that year side effects started to come up, and the beauty of it just completely passed. But I ended up still taking that soul sucking plant till this year, 5-6 years with a couple of months in between.

I have been on supervised probation with heavy drug testing for the last almost 3 years. Never had a problem with any tests.

From there, I started tapering off .5 g daily and only using at night. My dilemma is I’ve been using Bali this entire time, and I was going to just cold turkey it because I had a spark of motivation so I dumped it down the toilet. Then I got work loaded for tomorrow and have two jobs to get done when I typically am only given one. And I need sleep. So I bought meang da cause it was all they sold. Took 5 grams and was going to take another 5 cause I was at 10.5 yesterday. But I feel really euphoric and am thinking of the what I did and how unpredictable brands and potency are and how my wds will be worse tomorrow and should I stick with this Maeng da for the rest of the taper or switch back to Bali or mix the two or take 5g tonight and see if I can sleep then switch back or just taper down from the 5 if I can sleep.

If you are able to stop, you will look back in a few years, totally confused by your own behavior. How was it ever normal and acceptable to spend hundreds of dollars a month on a plant and then chug down nasty sludge several times per day? It didn't even feel good most of the time...

Everyone's journey is different; for me, I had to stop using all intoxicating substances... weed, alcohol, all of it. I didn't really have a drug problem - I had a 'me' problem, and I used Kratom to escape myself. I had to put all of it down and get help in order to get better.

However.. I use a fuck ton of kratom and it is an addiction. I can't seem to go without it and the funny thing is, I use so much and it doesn't really work anymore. Kratom got me off of hard drugs and likely saved my life. But ...

Maybe some of y'all can give me some advice. A little background first:

I'm currently 40, and have used and been addicted to opiods off and on since my early twenties. The last few times I was stuck on opiates I tapered down, hopped over to kratom, tapered off of the kratom, then quit it. The withdrawal would suck, with the same symptoms as opiate withdrawal, but would be much milder. I'd start on a Friday and be good to go back to work Monday, with almost non-existent PAWS. I'd been totally clean for a few years when I fell off of a ladder at work (I was an hvac tech) and broke my left pelvis into seven pieces. Which was absolutely fucking terrible. I was in the hospital for a week, and had two surgeries with two different incision point. During the first surgery the clamp they used to hold me open compressed a nerve bundle, and the pain from that was unbearable. Far worse than anything else related to the injury. They started me out on morphine, then dilaudid, then fentanyl. After a week in the hospital I was sent home with two weeks of 10mg percocets, which was fine, and the pain was under control enough that I didn't even finish them. But the withdrawal was absolutely horrific. Went the kratom route again, but when I tried to stop it, same thing: unbearably bad withdrawal. Like, worse than at any point in the past, even compared to cold turkeying a bad oxycontin habit. Over the next year I tried to quit the kratom again, but every time the withdrawal was atrocious. (as an aside I've also been taking extracts a lot, sometimes trying to get fucked up and not just maintenance dosing. I know, they're bad.) So a few months ago, I actually talked to my doctor about it, and he hooked me up with a therapist that specializes in addiction. So we made a three month plan, I tried to taper down but didn't much (only got down to about 15 grams a day). My doctor gave me five toradol for the exacerbated pelvic pain, five 1mg clonazepam, ondansetron for nausea, ropinirole for restless legs, and I got myself a little phenibut. I took a few days off of work and dove in. The weird thing is... it's not so bad so far. A few sweats and hot and cold spells, diarrhea, kicking and squirming last night, but that's it. In the past within 6-12 hours of my last dose I was pretty miserable, but now I'm over twenty four hours in and it's not that bad. Don't get me wrong, it fucking sucks, but it's not miserable. Is my time line going to be stretched out for some reason? Or have I inexplicably lucked into a mild withdrawal type of situation? Anyway, thanks everyone for this community. I've lurked around a lot over the years and you guys have been a lot of help in the past. And good luck to everyone with whatever you're going through!

However...After multiple times trying to quit and giving me the run around...”I won’t do this again, I promise, it’s only been a little this time, you don’t understand this makes me a better person, I haven’t used in days, weeks, I don’t know where you found that, it must be old, I forgot I had that.” We, I thought had come to an understanding. He was emotional and we discussed reaching out to get help whether it be to talk to me so I could help or using the tools he is learning through therapy. I just asked for honesty. I was tired of finding it hidden around our house especially in areas where it could have been accessible to our children. We have a 15, 13 and 8 year old. They see the tension and they see his short tempers, aggressive responses at times.
So the last couple of days had me suspicious. His behavior and his moods were not adding up...
And so this morning I let him go about with his sketchiness. I then found the stash...
I have a lot to think about...I can not live this life...
This stuff robs you of your real being all the while letting you believe it makes you a better person. The ones on the other side...the spouses, SO, children and family members should not have to ride this roller coaster...I’m fastly approaching the end of my ride...
What some don’t understand is that we on the other side have been robbed of a life. We WANT to be happy and enjoy what LIFE has to offer not stand by and wait for someone to come back to us. We ride this ride along side you...enduring the ups and downs...the unpredictable behaviors and emotions that you bring to the table...

I have battled anxiety and depression for the better part of my life now and Kratom along with other substances, that I have now kicked, helped me a lot with that at first. Then it became something I needed just to feel normal and I know I have to get rid of it. I really wanna quit but at the same time I know that my anxiety will return even stronger. I am sober for two days now and I‘m not too sure I can make it, which fuels my anxiety even more in a way. Even though I‘m only two days in, I catch myself thinking about how I could continue using in a “responsible” way after I am done with PAWS. And that little voice in my head is trying to convince me, that this would be a great compromise. That’s how I relapsed twice before.

I think it is key to always remember that no matter how good a substance makes you feel, no matter how much it makes you forget your issues, you are just fooling yourself and you are choosing to be ignorant about your own feelings. We all gotta face our demons instead of ignoring them, because if we don’t, they will come back way stronger. Can’t bottle that shit up forever. There is always a reason as to why we use.

I‘d rather choose the hard way now and suffer a bit as a consequence, than being a slave to drugs all my life. But man it’s hard.",5

It’s my 3th day without kratom and I feel so restless that it’s really torturous. I never had this problem before when I did kratom for so long (a week) but I started on Mirtazapine 5 weeks ago and I wonder if it’s excerbating the restlessness because of its antihistamine effects. The restlessness concentrates in my left arm and I had this effect when I first switched from Lexapro to 15mg Mirtazapine (with no kratom involved). The only thing that helped me to get through last 3 days was vodka and cutting myself. When is it going to get better? Would stopping Mirtazapine cold turkey help with this symptom (I want to discontinue it anyway because it makes me too tired and hungry)?",1

Because of the slow taper and the low dose I started with, it honestly hasn't been too hard. During the day I actually feel quite good.

The issue is that every night I've had the same onset of (relatively mild) withdrawal symptoms starting around the same time - tightness in my chest, a kind of restless anxiousness, and a headache. It corresponds roughly to my usual dosing time for the past year - I would usually dose once a day around 7-9PM. Is this a psychosomatic thing, like my mind/body remembers I haven't taken kratom only at and after that dosing time?

What I didn’t consider was just how much I’ve been taking (anywhere from 40-60gpd). The day started okay, I ran some errands and was determined to quit for real, but I would have mental breakdowns where I would uncontrollably cry. I felt so raw and vulnerable, like my emotions were out of control. it got better and worse throughout the day. I went to the gym in CT and got through it, but the thoughts I was having were so scary to me. when I got home, I was suffering bad and crying my eyes out over the smallest things and the physical pain was so bad that I decided a fast taper would be much better for the rest of the NJ shutdowns. 


I took some Kratom at 6pm. I plan on taking 6-10gpd for the next week to get my body used to the new dosage instead of going through that

Just so you understand how I felt, Im pretty sure I never cried so much in one day. My soul felt so scared and hopeless, but a weight has been lifted at the same time.
. 

I really really wanted to stop right then and there, but I was such a wreck and i honestly don’t remember the last time I ever felt that disturbed in the head and depressed. I’m also thinking of seeing a psychiatrist for help/meds throughout this to ease the emotional side. Also, don’t be afraid newcomers, I’ve been taking Kratom for 4.5 years and have quit many times so the WDs are way worse for me now",4

I already deal with depression and anxiety as is, but without taking a dose 24 hours in im literally crawling out of my skin. Its terrifying and near impossible to get through without needing a dose to bring me back in. 

So here is my question: Suboxone treatment from a professional recovery clinic; can it help me? Im desperate for a way out of taking the kratom. Is a suboxone taper easier than a kratom taper? Especially when it comes to the mental symptoms? (which is what Im struggling with) For anyone that has tried it to get off kratom, please give me your experiences and thoughts on it. Any info at all is greatly appreciated. Main questions are how did the suboxone taper/wd compare to the kratom taper/wd and how long did it take you to stop using the suboxone entirely AND how did you feel when you were off of it.

They know they're addicted. That it's ultimately worsening their chronic pain, that it's a serious financial drain, that it's wrecking their sleep and their health. But they can't seem to stop. 


I really, truly sympathize. I love them dearly, I want to support them, and hopefully nudge them closer to quitting without guilt-tripping them. What would have helped you? Please tell me

Flatly refusing to buy it (they're disabled and homebound, I'm our only income) would be too great an abuse of trust. But I can't say the expense hasn't been hard. Blowing a week's gas money on a gross powder they don't even enjoy hurts, not to mention constantly buying milk to wash it with or loperamide to ease the symptoms.

I think my psycho/physiology is different from most of you guys. I haven't seen where anyone here was using that much. But it has to be possible.

A single dose of 20 grams does almost Nothing for me. I've been using for 4 months. When I started, 6-10 grams was enough at one time.

Now I was a heavy Tianeptine user 1.5 years ago...I skyrocketed to 1.5 grams over a year. I was cut off and had to wd CT.
The withdrawals were unbearable.
I tried to end it all...

So I guess I'm wondering, as I try to quit this, any advice?
I have money now and access to plenty of k.
So I'm thinking of reducing by just 2 grams at a time... maybe just one.

I have the sweats every night now...and terrible RLS here and there.
I am re-dosing in the early morning but just 4 grams to stabilize me and go back to sleep.

This after having discovered kratom two and a half years ago, and struggling to quit for almost two years. I’ve gone through countless cycles of relapse; tipping points, and withdrawal. At my worst, I would use up to twelve grams per day.

It took a pandemic for me to wake up. I didn’t want to be compromising my immune system with an addiction, much less having a  withdrawal cycle coincide with a possible infection (that’s my anxiety speaking). And while I DID come down with something coincidentally during the acute withdrawal phase, I am over the hump and feeling well now. 

Throughout this period I didn’t use any helpers. No supplements, no cannabis, no nothing. The worst part was losing sleep for a good 4/5 days, but I’m starting to think that the fastest way for the brain to rebalance is to embrace the suck, reminding yourself along the way that it WILL rebalance, with time.

I’ve realized that my health, both physical and mental, are pivotal during these uncertain times. I’m hoping that after this pandemic, I can maintain this attitude; health is important even in certain times. Hang in there everyone!",8

So I looked for a solution in drugs. (I'm german so some words or sentences in my post are gonna weird)

  


I didn't just take drugs, I took everything. Benzos, propofol, amphetamines - just everything I could get my hands on at work. I didn't steal from patients, my job included ordering medicine, so I was living the junkies dream.

  


I got clean, have a new job and a wonderful girlfriend now. But half a year ago I discovered kratom (fuck those assholes in the kratom subreddit for lying to me, of course kratom is dangerous), today I ordered almost half a kilo kratom because I'm scared that the delivery system here breaks down cause of Corona. After I paid my order I acknowledged for the first time that I have a problem.

  


What do I do now? I take probably 30 gram stretched out over the whole day. There's no treatment here in Germany, people don't even know the drug. Do I go into cold turkey or do I temper down?",6

That's me today.. I'm on day 11 of quit, and I think the emotional/depression part is starting. Although I hope it isn't, everyone had bad days before kratom too, right? I am currently working from home due to the virus, and I'm not so sure if it's a good thing after all. Harder to stay busy, I can probably go a full day without doing anything and nobody would notice. I live alone, find it harder and harder each passing day to see friends (social distancing doesn't help). I've started drinking at nights when I used to do kratom, although, not in excess. 2-3 shots max usually chills me out just enough. Sleep is still HIGHLY hit or miss.

I've tried basically every supplement and/or medication (I can reasonably get) ever mentioned on here (magnesium, theanine, cbd, ginseng, caffeine, gaba etc). Some with mild success.

Anyway, too much detail there. What's your routine when you wake up and just feel that dread, that 'seriously f\*ck my life, my legs feel like anchors/ feeling' :/",8

I am wide awake at my driver intervention program (last night) and just discovered the original results were incorrect for the marathon I ran lat weekend.

Let me back up by saying I got sober on 6-25-2019 again after a 2.5 year relapse. Prior to that, I’d been sober for 18 months straight. Once I started again, it was a downhill slide and I had really spiraled out of control by the end. 

I started taking Kratom in early August full time. I was on it for over 4 months straight. I dosed 4 times a day to 6 at the end @ 25-40 gpd. I trained hard for the Columbus marathon while on it and I finished with a 3:28 (Boston marathon qualifying time).

A friend of mine casually mentioned how I must’ve only qualified because of Kratom. I’ve never been so pissed in my life so I got off it and decided to run another one Kratom free to prove it that I did that shit on my own!!! I trained even harder for it.

So I just want to say I now know it was all a facade. Did it make me feel awesome at first? Yes. Was it essentially speed and a bit of euphoria at first? Yes. But as time went on my tolerance grew and I was so worried I’d never be able to quit. I was wrong. I did quit. And guess what? I beat my marathon time by 6 minutes and conquered my goal of a first place finish after all!!! 

I just want to tell y’all this to inspire you and help you break free of the manipulative lies this drug will whisper to you. It will tell you all the reasons you can’t live without it and that it’s helping you. 

You are better off without it my friends!!! It will deceive you in the long run. Don’t let it trick you into staying stuck! You are stronger than you think!! 

Much love ❤️",48

I discovered this community about a week ago and am very grateful for its existence.  It's helped me immeasurably over the past several days, and for that I am expressing heartfelt love!

My story... I am 56, male, in good physical condition, and exercise ALOT.  I have taken kratom for about 3 years.  Relatively small doses.  Once per day, about 3-5 grams.  On average took Kratom 3-4 times per week.  So one large teaspoon, once a day, a few times per week, for about 3 years.

For various reasons, I have decided to quit.  It's not in my best interest to keep using it, and 12 days ago I threw out my supply and hopefully will never look back.

One of the reasons I wanted to post was even at my relatively low dosage, I could tell I was addicted, and that realization is both scary and depressing.  All I pray for now is that I will not relapse.  I do not want to be dependent on what's clearly a mind altering drug.

I have been lucky to have almost no physical withdrawal symptoms other than pretty bad fatigue.  Exercise helps immensely,  but my body can only take so much of that.  My biggest issue by far seems to be cravings.  It's as if my brain is on fire, begging for what I have fed it for the past few years.  It's an awful feeling.  Any insights into when the cravings might begin to subside would be greatly appreciated.

Thru God, prayer, and groups like this, I will get through this rough patch.  I am writing this as I watch a live stream of my church's service, and the tears started flowing as I typed and listened, knowing God has given me, and the rest of us, the strength to do ""this"".

At that point, I just thought it was a funny word. My friends talked about how much it helped with anxiety and mood. Although I was always generally happy, grad school had brought out alot of anxiety. Kratom helped me to instantly feel amazing. Like anything that was happening was manageable, even if it was stressful. Fast forward to when I started my job outside of school, that's when things became a problem. Once every couple of days turned into every day, and every day turned into multiple doses throughout the day. I started finding that I couldn't cope with my intensely stressful job, let alone typical every day worries. My life has been revolving around when I can ""feel good again"". But as soon as that good feeling starts to wear off, I start to panic. I have never had panic attacks, but have had many since beginning this terrible habit. Which is why I know this drug has brought more bad than good. I have tried to quit CT multiple times and have failed due to the withdrawal symptoms. My girlfriend thinks I have been done with this habit for months now, but I have been secretly buying it and taking it. I am embarrassed to talk to her about this again. I do plan to tell her about it, as I can't keep things from her. Our relationship will be strained if I continue to lie about this. It would kill me inside. But I am just not ready at this time. My first step is to begin the process of quitting. I plan to taper, as quitting CT was so unbearable. I guess what I'm looking for is encouragement. I feel so dumb for letting this get this bad. I have lost joy in every day life and my thoughts have turned dark. I am a slave to something and that feels terrible. I also feel like I've been living a lie. No one knows about this and I feel so alone. Thanks for reading. And please provide positive feedback and suggestions. I am ready for this new chapter.",10

Around Halloween last year I decided that I was going to quit my 4+ years continuous Kratom use. The problem was I had trips planned, holidays and all kinds of general excuses as to why my quit date had to be New Years. Nonetheless, I planned and tapered. I reduced my 20-25 gpd first to 14 then to 8. Yep, I felt fatigued and irritable after both drops for about 5 days. I remained on 8 gpd for about 3 weeks in December and planned to taper lower but did not possess the discipline. I had my date set in stone and knew for a fact there was nothing that was going to stop me. 1-1 is my quit date. I tried supplements (valerian root, lemon balm, magnesium, cbd, vitamin c). I can’t say any of these reduced the suffering. Day 14 I needed sleep. I got a sleeping pill from my Dr. This was a game changer as melatonin and Benadryl made things worse. Day 21 I started to turn the corner. Today is day 73. After 4 years, I still have healing but I’m 70% better. If you truly want to quit then do it. If you have reservations then quit kidding yourself and wait until your ready. No one or no one thing can help you but yourself. You cannot be weak. Believe in yourself.

I am trying again (for the 12th time) to attempt a cold turkey off of kratom. I have been using 40-50 grams daily for two years. I've been trying to come off for 1.5 years now. I have tried everything (tapering, cold turkey, rehab). I am continuing to try to quit because I refuse to surrender to the kratom.

I recently got a prescription for Etizolam (benxo similar to Xanax) and I'm going to use it to help with the withdrawals. I will be extremely cautious with it and only use it for the first 72 cold turkey. For me personally, the withdrawals are absolutely brutal. I have tried and failed at cold turkeys many, many times. Is there any advice that you guys have about how to survive a cold turkey without giving in? I always end up quitting at some point due to the feelings of absolute panic and desolation, cold sweats, restlessness, insomnia, panic attacks, etc. When the pain of withdrawals gets intense, I can feel myself losing control of my sanity and I just start screaming/crying for long periods of time. I'm hoping that the Etizolam will help, but I'm sure it can only do so much. I have never made it past about 50 hours cold turkey. Will you guys tell me when your withdrawals started to get better? When I'm in the middle of them, it feels like they'll never end. Also, please share any advice on how to get through my cold turkey!",3

It's an addiction, nonetheless, even at these super small doses, and I wonder if anyone else has been in the same boat? I see all the 30-40 GPDers and think damn, getting off of 9 a day was hard enough back then.

I'm just glad to be on the sober side of this COVID-19 curve ball.  One thing that kratom abusers need, and ultimately create for themselves is a static world where nothing changes.  Though there are events going on around us that demand our attention and action, we built our kratom cocoons (by constantly dosing) to avoid.  So we ""protected"" ourselves from the difficult situations, but also deprived ourselves of the flipside- emotional connection with loved ones, for example.  We've learned that's not the way to live.  In fact, it is not living.  It is how a plant lives, indifferent to the elements.   Funny how the plant from southeast Asia turned us into plants.

Sweats, runny nose, tearing eyes, but nothing awful.  Also a little depressed and anxious.  I fear withdrawal is going to hit me like a shit ton of bricks tomorrow if timelines I’ve read are right.  Did I dodge a bullet or is one still coming?",5

So im pretty much hooked on Kratom, love to use it like 30-35 grams a day for 7-8 months, mostly while working or in the Evening with soms weed 

But sometimes it happens that i dont have any Kratom left or not enough and i need to wait a day before the mail man arrives. 

I get real bad insomnia cant sleep 2/3 days (didnt go further in withdrawal bought new Kratom :(  ) my neck starts to Hurt and my back also feels like shit. Everything is so cold and im getting angry or anxius. Especially the insomnia really kills me

My main problem is that i've come off a cocaine and alcohol addiction and really fucked up my Financial situation so the last 5 months i have 2 jobs work 7 days a week and really cant just go in withdrawals because i have to work cant call in sick.

so about 2 years ago i got my hands on 150 oxycodon pills and used them 2 months everyday but just could stop without problems no withdrawals or anything

My point is if i would get a box of oxy and use it 1 week without Kratom, would that help to skip the withdrawals ? Or just get back after a week oxy? 

Im dying to find out how to stop this plant without losing my energy to work.

Thing like ibuprofen and naproxen just dont seem to work for me, i smoke everyday weed so it doesnt really get me trough the night, i could also get some diazepam maybe just really need a shortcut (if there is)

Also tried alcohol to sleep but i just wake up after 1/2 hours feeling completely fucked",1

Besides my own personal family I had entire other families relying on me to keep jobs moving forward. So both the customers and employees. Things were such that without me everything stopped. Overwhelming!

I had to either keep using and definitely get worse or quit. This was how I saw it: If I keep using the options were possibly kill myself from the hell I'd placed myself in or die from the damage I was doing to my own body.

So quit it was although I'd likely ruin everything I'd worked for. Still live a lot longer and not in a mental prison definitely won out. Seemed like a better option. But if I got lucky I could quit and not burn down my world around me in the process.

I got the flu, like for real, and kratom wasn't working for me anymore. Even more ineffective while sick so I stopped the second day after knowing I had influenza A but it was too much. I got back on kratom until I got over the flu. In that short time it gave me a couple days to plan. I got everyone and everything doing what needed to be done over the next few days so I could disappear and quit. I ended up taking 10 days and I went back after that 10 days telling everyone I was still sick and I'd need help to keep up. I was completely surprised how helpful others were. Employees stepped up to the point I cried at how grateful I was. More so than I ever expected. 

I realized I was truly lucky to have been in that exact situation at that time. 2 years prior and I would not have been in that situation. Actually never before in my life would I have been that lucky.

My point is... the up coming Coronavirus has got everyone freaked out. Right or wrong makes no difference here and I don't have a dog in that fight cause I don't know. But is there a silver lining? The quarantine period is 14 days! I mean come on, perfect right.

Now could be the time to jump if you're in a situation where typically you can't just take 2 weeks off. It's a lie. I know that but to possibly save your own life it's a small price to pay. Just throwing this idea out there for those that may be in that situation. 

Btw I hope anyone that actually gets or has the virus doesn't take offense to this. I'm not saying get sympathy from others by telling them you got some virus, but take the time to heal. And maybe a few years down the road spill the beans. Grated we've probably done worse getting or hiding the kratom use.",3

Little background: I've been using Kratom daily for a year and a half. I got up to 35gpd at my heaviest use and have tapered down to 15gpd now. I'm having a hard time tapering. I feel the chills creeping up every 5 hours. I am emotional. I just want this to be over. My hair is falling out badly.

Glad to be back in this group again. I once quit kratom years ago and didnt touch it for years until my girlfriend and I broke up and I fell in a deep depression. I used for about 7 months and reached the point where it stopped working, I was spending too much money and my mood swings were increasing. I knew if I continued to use or if I increased my dose more than I was (25-30gs a day) I would be in for rough withdrawals. 
Im on day 5 of a rapid taper. I used to dose 3 times a day now I'm only doing my evening dose to help with sleep and decreasing my dose by a half gram each night.
Overall it's going well. I'm a bit depressed, moody and irritable and wake up in the middle of the night with RLS but I'm alright.
I'm supplementing with kava during the day and melatonin and magnesium at night but just ordered some DPLA (DL Phenylalanine) as I've heard good things about it for people quitting kratom. 

Has anyone had any experience with this supplement and how should it be taken? I know people arent doctors here and I'm not asking for medical advice but I'm curious what would be the proper way to dose using DPLA to alleviate my withdrawal symptoms. 

Thank You",2

Just thought I’d share some insight that may help if your on this page to see if Kratom is a good replacement for other substances.

I’ve been in and out of recovery for about 6 years now. Mostly opiates and alcohol. After almost 3 years of being completely sober I started to get curious and see if there was anything out there to (what I used to say) help with my anxiety. Quick google search and then this wonderful miracle plant presents itself to me on my screen.

“This would definitely be fine to do, people use plants for everything” or  “if I can take St.johns  wort for depression, why not this for anxiety”.

Sure enough I was off to the head shop to pick up some red vein because, clearly I needed the pain relief that goes along with that strain.

Fast forward two years, I lay in bed typing this on day two withdrawal of a 50-60 gram daily use. I have not slept since yesterday, my lips are dry although I’ve drank so much water, I can’t help my feet from rubbing together and I feel like the top upper half of my body is tingling.

This is my first time detoxing by myself without any medical help. And I’m telling you this SUCKS!

Please do yourself a favor... or at least just take into consideration my experience.... when your thinking about starting Kratom. It’s totally not worth it.",31

Long days, situations turning on a dime, misinformed people overreacting,  etc. It is really nice to be in control, and I'm downright proud of myself for being in a position to contribute at work instead of bitching and moaning about life (kratom causes us to make excuses for everything, lash out at the slightest inconvenience).

L-tyrosine and D-phenylalanine are all I need right now. *****

Tried and failed quitting at least 50 times (i used 15grams kratom per day mainly, 

and often between 50 and 100mg  of tramadol instead of kratom... but i never took these together due to risk of OD)

I always relapsed around the 10day mark due to Insomnia/RLS/No concentration or energy at work.

One important thing was quitting Melatonin at night, since it aggravates RLS. Also I didn't drink coffee for the first 10 days or so.

For the first 5 days I used Mucuna Pruriens(7% L dopa) because I felt like my brain was so messed up it needed this strong supplement/drug. But this stuff can probably cause early onset parkinsons disease and permanently destroy your brain....  so if anyone here decides to use mucuna be sure to not use it for longer than 5 days cause it can probably easily ruin your life.

Day 1: 200+200+100mg mucuna

Day 2: 200+100+100mg mucuna

Day 3/4/5: +-300mg Mucuna

Day 6 til day 21: 250mg(max500mg) L-tyrosine in the morning + 250mg couple hours before bed. Also 250mg L-tryptophan in afternoon and 250mg L-tryptophan at night couple hours before bed. I feel like L tyrosine & L tryptophan compete with eachother and if you don't use both your dopamine/serotonin will become unbalanced.

&#x200B;

I'm also using Omega 3 fish oil and multivitamin;
And the past 2 weeks or so I've been using 400mg of piracetam ecerymorning and citicoline for adhd, but if u don't need it don't take it. 

 I suspect its the L-tyrosine & L-tryptophan which has kept me functional the most and allowed me to sleep.

Last time i tried quitting L tyrosine was around day #12. That day I took L-Phenylalaline instead; which is a bit weaker than L-tyrosine. But the brainfog/lethargy was too much and I had to resume intake of L-tyrosine. Maybe i should try a higher dose of L-phenylalaline next time.

&#x200B;

I forgot to mention withdrawal symptoms have been close to nothing since the start of this drug/supplement regimen. I can feel my body/brain has awakened to reality but I'm not at the stage where I can drop these relatively harmless (?) l-tyro and l-trypto just yet.

&#x200B;
***70 days clean!***
The past 20 days i've taken kratom 4 times due to some insomnia and a return of withdrawal pains. ***I noticed some triggers for these withdrawal pains that led me almost to relapse a few times:***

- Taking any dose of melatonin (gives RLS and bad protracted withdrawal symptoms)
- Taking not enough of L-Tyrosin (this substance increases amount of dopamine/adrenalin and really helps with protracted withdrawal pain. i need around 750 to 1000mg per day)

I was taking 15-20 grams to get off at first and now I'm down to 10ish a day. I took 2.5 grams this morning when I usually take a larger dose and three hours later I'm getting those pesky withdrawls I tried to fend off. Biggest is aching lower back, rls, and this weird panicky confused mind. 

Do you all get that weird mind effect when dropping doses/withdrawing? Its like I sit down to do a paper but I can't even sit in one place and focus on the activity. I get light headed and twitchy ish and have to pace around my room while thoughts race. I know depression and lethargy is common, and I get that too, but I mostly get this panicked confused type head space for the mental effects. What's yalls experience? This symptom was why during initial withdrawal off of harder opis I craved and bought Kratom, it literally prevents me from doing anything but pacing, stretching my legs, and thinking.",2
2020-03-10 15:13:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fgj7d1/other_opioids_not_working_during_kratom_withdrawal/,Other opioids not working during kratom withdrawal?,"Hi, folks. Am currently detoxing from an on-and-off kratom lifestyle, averaging around 10-20GPD a day for six months -- however, I've also abused various opioids over the last 4 years, from codeine to tramadol.

I'm currently the third day off kratom, but for the next two days I must be at top efficiency for work so cannot be in detox mode -- have done it before over the years, and I've simply just become too cowardly to go through it again... However, I have no kratom, but do have some dihydrocodeine.

So, today, I decided to test drive my brain's opioid response to not having a pharmaceutical painkiller in it for six months... but, alas, it simply dulls the kratom withdrawal slightly, and does not give me the usual warm euphoria that it did so for many years. I find this very odd?

Like a lot of people, I have spent years reading through the science and testimonies of how our brain's work in response to these chemicals, and although I still read conflicting reports on whether the brain differentiates between the different drugs, or it simply sees it as the same thing, but in different potencies (together with the fact that everyone's brain is different, and therefore could possibly be either or), I am convinced that, be it codeine, tramadol, dihydrocodeine, or kratom, my brain simply processes it as the same thing, activating the same exact receptors, only different in the receptors being turned on at different strengths and durations, depending on the drug, meaning that I can't use one effectively to detox from the other, which is frustrating. Others seem to be different, and *can* use the likes of methadone or suboxen (is that the one?) to come off other opioids, but I don't think my brain will make it that easy for me.

However, I am simply dumbfounded as to why  dihydrocodeine -- a moderately strong enough opioid -- can have its effects dulled down to, what feels like, 10% effectiveness by a post-kratom brain -- three days without it in there -- something considered nowhere near as powerful.

Anyone had any similar experiences or science about this? It's incredibly frustrating, as it means my work over the next few days is going to hell.",3

Just wanted to update on how yesterday went. I wanted to start my taper by seeing how low I could go and still withstand the acutes that would set in. For the most part, I spent yesterday in bed, sleeping, sweating. Had a little energy boost after my third dose around 3:30 pm (I am spacing my doses out by about four hours, 8 grams each) and was able to do a load of laundry, pre-make some food and wash my car. By the time the evening rolled around I could feel the insomnia kicking in and I had searing pain in between my scapula’s. Back pain and RLS are usually the hardest parts for me with withdrawal. I was tempted to take 4 more g of my red vein but instead I ate four Advil and took a couple magnesium supplements and was able to sleep. Woke up at 6:20 sweaty betty, runny eyes, RLS LIKE CRAZY. I was scheduled to go to a workout class but that wasn’t gonna happen. Took my first dose of 8mg and I’m feeling pretty OK right now. I have The next couple days off work… Right now my plan is to drop 2 mg every three days and see if I can tolerate that. I noticed I dropped a few pounds, but that might be from not working out the past couple days. I am 5’11”, female and the scale this morning read 122 pounds… Hopefully through all of this I won’t start to look like a skeleton. I’m really hoping that I will be able to continue to go to the gym because I know that that will help with my mood...but right now I just don’t have the energy. Trying to stay positive, and motivated... a lot of loving self talk through this. It sounds stupid, but beating myself up in my brain for getting myself into this situation again isn’t going to be helpful on the road back to my healthy self.

My logic behind this was just in case of an ultimate freak out, anxiety attack, something of this nature, where I would just need to take 2-3 caps to level out and calm  the f down.

Has anybody else held a little bit for this or any reason? Is this a bad idea? I haven't had cravings since day 3 I'd say, when I started seeing myself in the mirror again. So I'm not worried about caving to feel the 15 minute shitty high, then hating myself afterward.",3

I have been having a horrible day. Drank too much alcohol last night and blacked out until around 9 the next day. Apparently I drove absolutely blackout drunk to get more alcohol at around 8. And bent our fence pretty bad. WTF?

I'm absolutely mortified. I was never this reckless while on kratom. It really screwed up my receptors/impulse control when I came off it.

Anyway, so I relapsed. I was feeling so suicidal (not from the blackout/car thing, just some personal family issues. My family now thinks I'm in such a danger to myself and others that I don't need to ever be left unattended and my room should.be searched constantly. 

Also, they hide the deadbolt keys every night so I can't get out of the house. I used to love my midnight walks as an insomniac. But last night and my alcohol binge/blackout poisoned the well.

Probably totally justified, it's just that I'm 22 and it really makes me feel like despite how far I've come things just keep getting worse. I'm cooped up in my room 24/7 just watching the time go by surfing pointless internet posts. I still have no motivation and severe anhedonia at 49 days. I have textbook chronic fatigue syndrome/fibromyalgia. I was symptomatic even before the kratom but now it's way worse.

I have more parent-induced restrictions on my life than I did just 2 weeks ago. And I can't move out because I have a chronic intestinal illness and my parents are basically my caregivers. Plus... I can't be left alone with my own thoughts. If I'm alone too long if gets bad. Which is what happened today and causes my relapse.

TL;DR: Relapsed at 49 days, parents are forcing me into basically an at home rehab and it's a bit annoying. :(

Edit: I probably did like 5 grams just to feel it.

Sometimes I wish I never told my family I was quitting.  Their opinion on me is terrible now. I'm just this addict to them now. I'll just walking around outside and my dad will make a remark about how I should get inside because he doesn't want me to do anything sketchy or go anywhere.",3

. Forum has been a huge source of support. Feeling better now then first few days, insomnia and fatigue biggest issues. Very lucky to have off work this time around especially cause fatigue and insomnia are the biggest issues for me..Knowing that I'm DONE for good also helps, it's my identity to be a non kratom user and that means no thinking about occasionally using on the weekends or whatever BS I told myself the last times. Usage pattern and effects were typical of others stories here. Day one and two was home with the heat up to 85 while I'm sweating and cold at the same time. Stomach cramps, aches. I've never had any other kind of opiate WD but the effects were definitely the worst this last time around. I've seen friends lost to heroin and it really puts things in perspective that that could have been me if i was slightly more reckless in my younger days because I definitely have a bit of an addictive personality.  Would always get intradose withdrawals tapering so I said fuck it last week when I ran out and didn't get any more ordered. The next day I got in my car I think three times as there's gas station kratom just a few blocks from me. Luckily I held out, I told myself wait to before 10pm when they close and if you think you need it for the night go ahead and buy a little bit. So I did wait til 10pm and didn't go buy any, didn't  sleep all night but I'm so glad I held firm... sleep has been a big issue but I know it will get better. So much is mental, I trick myself into thinking I need a substance to get things done while I managed to go on an eight Mile hike on day 5.. sure I felt exhausted this whole week but that doesn't mean I have to stay in bed all day just because I feel tired.. although I definitely stayed in bed a lot this week! Attitude is key for me I think


Feeling more laughter and connection with my wife, trying to be healthy and clear headed so I can make the life I want moving forward rather than waste my time on this green crap. Honestly the effects aren't that great even in the beginning but it's the availability factor plus fooling yourself it's a natural supplement or whatever that makes it enticing. Even in first month or two I'd feel a bit of a comedowm and moreish sensation after just an hour or two. Multiple doses daily became pattern quickly. The short duration of effects plus the fact it's a bunch of fluffy green powder made it SO INCONVENIENT to life as we all well know.. Past week had wide range of WD effects but I had felt like crap the past couple months anyway while using a ton of kratom- so at least now I know I'm doing sometime good. Knowing that this too shall pass...

The forum has been a huge source of support for me so just want to say hi and check in. Good luck to all and know that you can do it. I'm just trying to move ahead and take care of myself, eventually positive change will come as I do the right thing and you can accomplish that for you as well.",9
2020-03-09 21:57:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fg6a9h/day_16_after_relapse/,Day 16 After Relapse,"As I sit here typing this, I am still a little surprised I am feeling withdrawal symptoms after a 3 week relapse.  I am pretty much tired all the time, have occasional hot and cold flashes and have tons of anhedonia.  I’ve been through it enough to know it will go away, but that it’s just going to take time.

I found myself in this position about 5 weeks ago.  I had been clean for more than 60 days after a couple of years of off and on abuse.  I typically would take 30-60 gpd, either spread out or sometimes in one massive dose.  In the weeks leading up to this moment, I had become significantly better.  My energy returned, work became interesting again and I was sleeping somewhat normal again.  Then this amazing concert came up.  I decided to have a super bad ass weekend.

I told myself I was going to make a weekend of it.  I would drive to the show Friday night, grab a hotel and then head back home on Saturday.  I would spend Saturday recovering from a heavy night and what better way than to take some kratom!  I stopped and bought my favorite strains, ordered my favorite Thai food and plopped down in front of the TV.  It was great for a moment, but like kratom tends to be... it was very short lived.

Saturday and Sunday use turned into Monday and Tuesday.  Then I told myself I couldn’t quit midweek because I’d feel horrible.  I should wait for the weekend.  Friday gets here and I say... ehh, I’ll quit Saturday.  Saturday gets here and I tell myself I will just feel like shit Monday if I do it now, so I should wait till next weekend.  I did this routine for the following weeks, but eventually I did quit... on a Saturday.

Initially the relapse withdrawal wasn’t horrible.  The physical symptoms were very mild.  I slept a lot.  Then after about 3-4 days it started setting in, the extreme fatigue.  It wasn’t the worst I’ve had but it felt like I was transported back to the early days of my recent long term withdrawal.  Initially I scrapped through work and it slowly got better, but not much.  I was so extremely tired.  I had no interest in anything.  After a week, it was still pretty bad.  I was surprised, but knew what I was in for at the moment.

I had 3 days off last week.  I got off on Tuesday, but crashed super early after I tried to drink a few beers.  I woke up feeling miserable.  The withdrawals plus hangover were horrible.  I woke up, showered, ate and got back in bed.  I slept another 6 hours, for a total of what seemed like 20 hours.  Basically the next 5 days were similar, minus the alcohol.  I would wake up, clean up a little bit, do some small chores and then get on the computer.  Since I wasn’t burned out from work, I found YouTube and a few video games interesting.  Basically, I’d spend every day getting up around 8 or 9a, nap around 11a for 2 or 3 hours, then stay up till about midnight.  I’d smoke dabs all day, at least once or twice I smoked too much and passed out early.

Basically I spent my “vacation” just relaxing to the max.  I ate, slept and smoked like it was nothing.  It was both great and incredibly boring.  I feel like I needed a lot more time.  When I returned to work today, I was exhausted from the break along with the time change.  Luckily, everyone else was feeling it, so I  didn’t stick out too much.  Hopefully, I feel, that I will be much better by the end of the week.

This typically lasts about 30 days for me.  Since this is slightly milder, I think reaching day 20 this weekend should be the turn I need.  I didn’t smoke today and slept when I got home from work.  I slept a good 7 hours and woke up refreshed.  I think it will only get better!

Appreciate the love.

So I quit kratom back in September after 3 years of heavy use. It was Hell needless to say.

To combat anxiety I'm taking Klonopin at work ONLY 3 days a week. I see no issues there.

But on the weekend, I drink all day... Wine is my favorite, beer comes next. And when the hubs brings liquor home it's even harder to say no because it's instant anxiety relief.

Even before quitting K I began drinking alcohol daily since being married. My husband drank every day... I picked it up. (Edit: might as well add in we got married a year and 4 months ago)

On the weekends I'll try to wait til evening at least 5 to have a drink. But I'll end up drinking at 10 AM... Sometimes can wait til 12 or 3. Usually morning. Then I'll drink a bit here and there all day.

After work during the week I'll binge drink (for me it's binge drinking I'm a 110 lb female). I'll down 3/4 a bottle of wine at the least. And sometimes a beer on top of it, sometimes the whole bottle of wine.

My anxiety is INSANELY OUT OF CONTROL. It's always been a problem and I'm sure it's why I've gotten to this point. It's just so hard to combat. At this point even when I take Klonopin at work I'm so irritable during the day, I'm still anxious and overthinking....


Weekdays and weekends I experience tremors, sweating, and severe anxiety, tightness in my chest.

I just don't know what to do. Will quitting alcohol alleviate these issues? Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this but I've never in my life found a sub or even a group of people so helpful.",3

It's easy to feel like your world is falling apart even though it's just your brain re-calibrating. I think this besides the brutal physical wd is what keeps people coming back. Right now physically I feel okay a little uncomfortable but the negative thoughts, and waves of sadness make the time go by real slow.

I can’t believe I’ve gotten myself into this situation again. A little bit about me.. About 2 years ago I used Kratom to help me enf a 15 year Suboxone addiction. At the time it was a godsend and in March 2018 I decided that I would stop Kratom. It was awful to say the least, unlike any other opiate withdrawal I had ever experienced. While it mimicked past opiate withdrawal with the insomnia, chills, sweats, watery eyes and insane RLS/ back spasms... Kratom withdrawal seemed to last a lot longer and it was months of feeling like my bones were aching and my pelvis was broken before I started to feel better. I would also go a few days of feeling a bit better and then Bam out of nowhere symptoms would kick back in. I promised myself that once I was through that I would never ever pick up again as I never wanna go through withdrawl and months of not being myself. In October of last year I had a pretty bad fall off a horse and the doctor wanted to prescribe me pain killers. My Job is incredibly demanding and I am also a gym fanatic so instead of taking the prescribed medication I decided I would take Kratom to get me through. Fast forward to today... I have a 40+ gpd habit that has turned on me. No one in my life is aware of my situation (my fiancé or my mother Who would both be devastated) A few days ago I noticed that despite taking my normal dose I was finding myself hurting, with flu like symptoms, watery eyes and a very short temper. My anxiety is through the roof, sometimes feeling like I have to pull my car over because my heart is racing and I feel like I can’t breath. I can’t ignore it anymore. The shame of this Secret is tearing me apart on the inside. I’m going to start my taper today and hope that over the next few weeks I can get myself to a place that I can CT. Gosh, I find myself fantasizing about booking a hotel room out of town for 30 days where I can lock myself away just to get through the acute’s, but unfortunately my job is incredibly demanding and those around me would be completely perplexed as to my actions. Any way, I can’t tell you how much this forum helped me last time around and it feels so good to be able to let this out to others that know exactly what I’m going through. I appreciate the community and any help or support is so appreciated. Side note: I found a natural path doctor located by my work that offers IV therapy of heavy doses of vitamin C and magnesium and antioxidants and I think I might check them out to see if that might ease my symptoms through this process. In my fantasy I would be able to get through this by June when I have a huge hiking vacation planned... wishful thinking. Thank you and love to all of you...",9

Is it natural recoverable or I need testesterone replacement therapy by urology doctor (prescripted medications)?

How long time it will get back to normal?

**Did anyone recovered from testosterone deficit here?**

Before Kratom I have no problems with sex drive, motivation and positive thinking.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Testesterone replacement therapy is nonsence, because it will not heal you. They need you to sell medications and you are dependent on it to end of your life. Hormone balance can be recovered by workouts + Ashwagandha and some others natural supplements + positive mindset. Hormonal rebalancing it take aprox. 3-4 moths.",7

I am a functioning, but physically and psychologically stuck on this garbage.  I have tried to taper and only make it a couple of days even with agmatine.

I'm so sick of this plant. I am of average intelligence, but on kratom I'm in a constant brain fog. I forget everything, I can barely hold a conversation without having anxiety and sounding like an idiot. I'm sure this post will be full of typos and grammar errors. The brain fog is killing me along with horrendous hair loss, tooth enamel loss, skin problems, and a very low sex drive. On top of all of this is a deep chronic exhaustion that keeps me from enjoying life. 

So why am I still taking it? I guess I'm psychologically addicted? I have been prescribed gabapentin & clonidine for two years but I don't take the full daily dose so I have a large stock pile of both.

What if I stop the kratom cold turkey & replace it with the gaba & clonidine on the same time schedule as the k? Will that hit the psychological addiction aspect of feeling like I need something three times a day? What if I did this for a week, I  wonder if that would work?

I feel withdrawal even though I'm still taking it.,"This is so strange. To be brief I have the same story many have. Kratom was a miracle (and legal!) in painlessly jumping off suboxone which is notoriously hard to quit. I suffer from a lot of depression and the unexpected happened - kratom was the most excellent antidepressant ever.  I was HAPPY.  For a few months. Then it stopped making me euphoric but still kept depression at bay. Then abruptly last week it completely stopped working. I had tried all the suggestions to potentiate and ease tolerance before, when it stopped making me feel good, but nothing worked. As of a few days, I feel like I'm already in withdrawal even though I'm taking it. Not only does it do nothing for my mood, but I'm getting RLS at night. I have to sleep with kratom by my bed to stop it and go back to sleep.  I feel like hell, like I have the flu. It's possible I'm sick for real but I think it's kratom-related.  My mood has been abysmal. Crying nonstop. Horrible fatigue.I'm freezing. Couldn't go to work the last couple days. I feel like my world is falling in on me and I'm moving in two weeks and have so much to do but I don't have the energy to pack.  So then I start panicking. Yesterday I tried different strains at different doses, some high and some low..  None made me feel the slightest bit better. The only benefit seems to be the withdrawal would be worse if I didn't take some kratom. So last night I took a teaspoon at 2:30AM due to RLS, plus Klonopin. I'm also taking Immodium and Ibuprofen. That's another weird thing: kratom normally makes me very constipated but now it's the opposite.  This morning I took a teaspoon of kratom an hour after waking up hoping to stop what feels like a horrible hangover + depression and anxiety.  It didn't work but it might have been worse without it. I was able to do a few things.   

Is it possible to be withdrawing already even though I haven't quit?  This sucks. First, it worked great, then eventually I had to take it just for maintenance, to feel normal (but not happy anymore).  And now it seems to be making me miserable.  Any suggestions?  I have Klonopin, Immodium, l--tyrosine (someone mentioned that somewhere), Modafinil (which has no effect on me right now).  It's hitting me again now. My body wants the powder but it won't make me feel good. At best I won't feel like I'm dying anymore. This is bizarre. I want to quit badly! Would love advice and to know if this is possible to be in withdrawal while I""m taking it. Maybe my body wants more more more. And I'm withdrawing it if I don't feed it to myself frequently. But even then I still feel bad, just not AS bad. I'm willing to do anything to end this hell.",0

Stating to think on a more granular level.  On day one of our quit, one day equals 100% of your recovery. At 82 days, one day is comparatively a small fraction (1/82) of the total recovery.  So the perception is that I am now inching forward.  But nothing could be further from the truth. 

Improvements feel like they are coming slower, but the impacts are greater.  It's like I can draw a line from decisions I make today to a desired outcome further and further out into the future.  On kratom,  there was only now, and the next dose ( for me, anyway). Any discussion about events after that caused anxiety and anger.  Now that I am taking control of my life (home, finances, job, etc.), and becoming aware of how 3.5 years of kratom use led to neglect and damage to all these areas, I am pissed.

But I'm moving on, and repairing my life. Baby giant steps.  Small decisions,  granular commitments,  and wise use of my available resources (nearly decimated by kratom) to recover,  rebuild, and stockpile.

""One day winter will ask you what the hell you've been doing all summer"", someone once said. By the grace of God, I've been given the opportunity to wake up while it is still summer and get busy.  I will not be found wanting when winter comes knocking.

I'm an elite cyclist and Kratom would give me the post-work boost I needed to get through my workout. 
Fast forward to this spring. A LOT of significant life choices led me to stop keeping track of my intake and I was up to 25gpd. My body started feeling weird on the bike, so I quit Kratom cold turkey 10 days ago. 
However, I have a problem. First, I'm extremely lazy and secondly, riding gives me extreme anxiety. I can manage other physical activities (hiking etc), but that's not enough to cut the mustard as an athlete. Getting kitted and on the bike makes me feel like my skin has been peeled off. To add to this, not riding always worsens my anxiety. Not riding+Kratom withdrawals are HELL.
To add to all this, I started Lexapro a couple weeks before jumping off Kratom. It didn't help at all with my motivation.

I am stuck on my kratom taper because of a six month dabble with Xanax.  My own fault.

Gabapentin was great for 4 weeks, then I became very depressed. Felt terrible.   So I stabilized and started to taper, now down to 500 mg per day.  Now I am foggy and have PAIN where I did not have it before: arms, shoulders, on pectoral muscle. The sciatica is back.  Depression lingers.  Not too bad.  It’s sorta a dull calm foggyness, which is far better than anxiety. Total apathy. 

Of note: I quit phenibut > 1 year ago. ( 1000 mg per day for 6 months). This is likely of clinical importance.  No fear like when in PB withdrawals or taper buts lots of PAIN.  I think I have kicked the can down this road a few too many times.

Its gonna take me a few weeks to get off gabapentin now: then I resume my kratom taper from 10 gpd  currently.   So: I have made progress from 3 years of 20 gpd, quit subs ,  alcohol and nicotine with kratom.

My body was really getting screwed up by Kratom.  This is enormous TMI but the constipation from K was really bad.  I was developing bad hemmroids.  It was also clearly messing with my stomach.   I also believe that we don’t understand the long term physical effects of K- on liver and other organs.   Being on K made me eat shitty and not exercise.  That’s bad. 

K really dominated my mood/psychology.  I was happy when I was high and cranky coming down. I wasn’t “me” I was the drug. 

I really hated having this hidden secret from my family.  I’m blessed with a pretty good marriage and my wife would wig out if she knew the extent of my use.  One time she texted me that she was folding my laundry and putting it away and instead of being happy I was terrified of her finding my stash.

Every morning at 5 am. It didn't matter how late I took my last dose. I even tried swigging one right before I got into bed. I would still wake up at 5am-ish - exhausted, but unable to sleep, something yanking in my stomach, nose running like crazy, horribly depressed, barely able to walk with a creaky, rusty feeling all through my body - until I put that crap into me. Then I'd have a great hour or so before I started to feel it wane, and desperately try for the rest of the day to recapture that feeling - sometimes I did for another hour, most of the time I didn't. I just had to keep taking it to feel somewhat normal the rest of the day. Now I'm waking up like I used to before kratom. And it feels great! I'll never take waking up feeling normal for granted again! This is reason alone to have quit, not to mention the improved skin and eyesight and all the other ""normal"" perks I took for granted and let kratom sneakily, slowly rob me of!

This board has helped me immensely - whether reading other people's stories, tips or just venting on here. If you're thinking about quitting, just do it!! You can! The best way to think about it is that yes it will suck! But a month will go by either way. It will go by (really quickly) with kratom, or (really slowly) without it. But it will go by. In a month you can be free of the chains that kratom has put on you, or in the same boat you're in now. Keep thinking about what you want to be (and what you will be) next month. And what you don't. For many, you will feel better way before a month. For others it may take a little longer. But for the vast majority, you will be feeling much much much better in a month's time or less. And better and better each day! Good Luck!",10

I’ve had the LDN for weeks and just couldn’t quit K because my fear of suffering intense pain due to my chronic pain issues and autoimmune diseases. I don’t even know how much I took a day but I know I needed 7 625mg capsules every 3-4 hours. And have been doing that for the past 2 1/2 years. Before I quit I was back to having a lot of pain. But the fear was still there. I didn’t realize that I was actually addicted and swore it saved my life. At the time when i started I was bed bound and at that time thought it gave me my life back. Since quitting I have never been so miserable in all my life. But i can’t say for sure what is really causing everything because I was also exposed to the flu and have a hard time fighting infections, as well as starting LDN. All the symptoms are similar. The first couple days the RLS all over my body was so intense and all I could do was soak in hot epsom salt baths constantly. Also, the insomnia has been insane. I’m barely sleeping....even after 5 days. 10mgs of Melatonin did nothing for me. However I’m exhausted and thank god i didn’t have work this week and was able to cancel today. I have only been able to eat a few times and I’ve lost about 7lbs. The nausea and trips to the bathroom have been insane as well. As I said idk what part of this is withdrawal and what is maybe a virus or the LDN. All I know is I’m so miserable. BUT, I have noticed my libido is back!!!! In full force. I didn’t realize how much K affected that. I used to be insatiable but turned into not caring and even when I did...not much happened on my end. Also feeling very dehydrated. I’m so hoping this goes away sooner than later. Worse yet I forgot I had placed another order and a giant bottle showed up yesterday. I haven’t even opened the package yet and I’m not going to. Right now it feels like such a waste of money because i can tell you right now, as bad as I have felt the past 5 days, I will never ever ever go back. Never. This post most likely won’t help anyone but I have no one to talk to about all this. No one understands.",3

After reading others posts, I've finally decided that Kratom may be the cause of my symptoms. It is the only thing I have done differently the last year. The onset of my symptoms correlates to the beginning of my kratom use. I have quit. It's been 12 days. 

I started using kratom in Jan 2019. I did mostly a toss/wash 1 tsp in a drink in the morning, once in the evening each day. I enjoyed the effects. 

I have been a runner off and on for most of my life. I run/walk 2-4 miles daily. At first, I would take the Kratom before exercise and I would get a boost of energy, and a mental comfort while running. That went on for several months. 

In June 2019, I began to notice and occasional numbness in the arms while running. It would go away after I stopped. I also started to occasionally feel a tightness in the chest. It would also go away when I stopped. 

By Aug 2019. I was experiencing the pain every time I exercised. It was not intense, but noticeable. I didn't blame the Kratom. I thought it could be muscle, or rib bruising or other effects from an active life. 

By Oct 2019 I could no longer run past half a mile without an intense pain in my left chest. I had to stop in place and wait until my heart rate calmed to < 110. Then I could walk on. 

This prompted me to call a Dr. I kept using Kratom, but I stopped cardio exercise. Then I noticed a brisk walk was bringing the pain as well. I procrastinated the Dr. till Jan 2020. 

I saw the Dr. I went to a cardiologist. EKG normal, Stress Test normal but for my complaint of the chest pains after 3 minutes. Blood work normal; liver, kidneys good. Blood pressure somewhat elevated (as is my natural state). All good. I did not disclose Kratom. The Cardiologist suggested an exploratory Cardio Catheterization. I did not like the sound of it. I have put it off. 

During the same period of time. I developed sleep issues. I would sleep by 10 pm and pop wide awake with a racing heart about 2:30 am.  I tried techniques to prepare to rest and melatonin, but my sleep was unpredictable. 

Over the year my average resting heart rate also increased from low 60’s to mid 70’s – according to Fitbit. 

I have only noticed these things recently as I have begun to critically assess all my behaviors, my diet, and overall health. I came to the conclusion that it could be the kratom causing the issues. I decided to quit. 

It’s day 12. My sleep has improved! I sleep through the night. I’m getting longer deeper restful sleep. 

Unfortunately, the chest pains return every time I attempt any cardio activity. I slow down to a slow walk. I just tried to go for a brisk walk and got about 3 blocks before the pain caused me to stop.  

In the last 3 months I’ve gained weight due to my lack of activity. Maybe 8 lbs. that I don’t need. 

I’m hoping to get my cardio system back in order. I’ve been depressed about the fact that I cannot run and I should be a normal healthy 50 yr. old guy. 

I like kratom, but if it is the source of all this, then I am glad to go without. I have had a few cravings, but the hope of ridding myself of these pains is an overwhelming motivating factor. 

I hope this helps anyone else who is feeling unwell. I plan to post again as time passes to report that I’m back to running 4 miles a day. 

Good Luck to All!",4
2020-03-06 16:24:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fekhqa/this_is_my_attempt_at_accountability/,This is my attempt at accountability.,"First of all, I can’t believe I’m actually here typing this... I’ve watched this thread off and on over a year but wasn’t ever fully committed.

I’m a 31 yr old mom of 2 and I’ve been using for about 2 years. Usually about 4 large tbsp per day. Some more, some less. I measured today and believe I was taking anywhere from 20-30 gs per day.

I’ve always been a lover of opiates... I’ve used off and on probably 10 years until it became harder to find. I also struggle with anxiety... and major social anxiety.
Then low and behold.. K was presented to me. I thought I had found the holy grail. A legal way to feel the same effects without any negatives.
HA... hindsight is 20/20 right?

About a year ago I wanted to be done but never had the true willpower to cut it. I absolutely hate my days are scheduled around this green sludge. I hate planning to go anywhere, even a day running errands had to be planned with K.

I’ve always been a fairly “tidy” person. But the last 2 years my home and gone downhill. Months behind on putting away laundry. And zero motivation to get it done which actually leads to more anxiety. I hate who I’ve become. So many describe it perfectly... a shell of a person. 

To be honest, I have so many more panic attacks these days than I did before K. Most of them are due to “coming down” or even taking too much.

Quite frankly I’ve felt like crap from this sludge for months but my mind tells me just to take more and I’ll feel better. Only to feel worse.

Last week I started having major Gastro problems. Any dose gave me extreme pain and nausea. My intestines actually ache. And I know it’s from my use. I had no choice but to cut back.
I realized I’m done. I want to be done. I’m tired of being a prisoner to this disgusting sludge.

I have two major trips with friends and family this summer and I want to actually enjoy the moments. I don’t want to wish the time away for my next dose.
Gosh, I’d love to be able to sit and enjoy a glass of wine.

So last week I had no choice but to cut back... so I went from 20+GPd to about 5.. honestly the only amount my stomach can tolerate for the last few days.
I’m going to taper for a few more days until I get down to 2/3 and jump.

I’m ready to be done. One thing I’ve noticed is my heart is racing... constantly. 

No one truly knows that I use this stuff... much less the extent of my addiction to this. My SO just thinks I use it for anxiety sometimes. I haven’t admitted I NEED it. And my mood as been pretty crappy the last few days. 
So I guess this is just me posting for some accountability to a group that understands.

Here’s to some crappy days ahead... in hopes to find the sunshine again.",48

As the title says, Its the 4th day since I quit CT, and I suppose I’m writing this in hopes of reassurance. My withdrawals, for about the last 2 1/2 days, have been horrible. My body is in constant discomfort and my anxiety is extremely elevated. Sleep is impossible to come by unless I use nyquil.

I had only been taking kratom for about a month as a means of relieving depression and anxiety, taking usually about 3 grams per dose once or twice a day, with a few days of increased usage. Unfortunately though, this experience has made the truth about kratom very apparent, and while i would do anything to get rid of this sensation I refuse to continue using something that has the potential to make me feel this horrible.

I was wondering how much longer i should expect to feel this peak and what the remainder of this process will look like in terms of timeline, how i’ll feel in the days to come, etc.

Also, I have read that the acute symptoms only last 3-4 days but does that mean since the last dose or since you actually started feeling the symptoms?



while i dont know how im going to do this, Im confident that I will, I just feel very anxious about the upcoming days and felt the need to reach out.

Last summer I was taking anywhere from 6-9 doses a day of about 9g, rotating strains.  I was able to cut one dose away, all at once, every couple of weeks.  Made it down to 4 but ended up going back to 5 and had trouble cutting out that fifth dose.  I’m graduating college this semester and so just in case I have to travel to a state where kratom is banned for some sort of orientation or training for a job (thought I was gonna go to RI for a while), I decided I needed to stop.  So over the course of a week I’ve been dropping 10g.  Just started last week and what I’d do is on Fridays I’d immediately drop a gram on all my doses and if I felt any sort of discomfort I’d find somewhere in between the new dose and the previous dose and work my way down.  And then on Tuesday I do the same thing and then do it all again on Friday.  So far I’ve cut 10g a day in a week and have had only minor discomfort if anything at all.  How come a lot of people say you should taper at a much slower pace than this?  Is this going to end up getting harder as I get lower?  Any tips on when I should jump or change how I do things as I get lower?  Just today I started taking 6g a dose, 5 times a day.

I quit 2 days ago.

Although it wasnt my choice to quit cold turkey, where I am located there is no Kratom available.

I’ve quit before with absolutely no withdraw symptoms other than trouble falling asleep so I thought this would be the same.

Boy, was I wrong.

I’ve been having cold sweats for the past 2 days. Unable to sleep, trouble eating, and weird heart palpitations. It was so bad last night I considered admitting myself to the hospital. But, I drank a beer and took some melatonin and I was able to fall asleep.

At this point, what should I do? I’m considering ordering Kratom online to taper off to deter these horrible symptoms.

How long will this last? I don’t feel like myself. I’m in constant mood swings and can’t focus on work I have to do.

I’m either constantly exhausted or extremely wired.

On the first day, I slept for about 14 hours. The second day, I slept for about 5.

I’m currently on the shitter experiencing some bad diharrea. 

Any advice? Did anyone go through similar experiences? Could this withdraw be deadly or am I just freaking myself out?

I posted a lengthy post yesterday and don't have time this morning to write much, already running late, but I just wanted to quickly say this;

For anyone who doesn't have other dependency issues, last night I took 400mg gabapentin and 1mg Xanax and it knocked me the fuck out. Actually overslept a bit, which normally gives me a ton of anxiety and has rarely happened in the last few years. I'm a little groggy, but it is better than the alternative.

Again: I AM NOT SOMEONE WHO HAS DEPENDENCY ISSUES ON OTHER THINGS. I really, REALLY don't want to get in a position where someone reads this and get hooked on benzos or gaba (2nd day of gaba at night and I'm done with my old supply, first night of xanax and will likely not use any tonight based on how I'm feeling now), but for everyone else, definitely worth a try.

So I started doing 10gpd. That grew within 6 months to 120gpd. It got expensive. I tried to stop and felt the same flu like symptoms heroin gave me.
I've read the taper guide and decided to go my own route with it. I counted how any tablespoons I was doing. 15 a day. I reduced that 1/3. So 10 last week. 
9 this week but somedays I give in and do 10. 
My plan is to take a tablespoon less every week.
I'll take 2 tbs every 3 hours except the last one at night. I'll take one so I don't have restless legs.

The next day (Sunday) I had nothing and by Sunday night about 7 pm I had some nasty withdrawals setting in. The usual stuff. Monday was bad too but I began stabilizing with 2.5-3 grams 3X per day (roughly 10 grams total) which equates to about half of my normal daily Kratom dose (roughly 20 gpd) 
Felt okay those 2 days following the brief WD, slept great but woke up WD’ing Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday morning so I decided I wanted to up the dose to get my equilibrium back and then officially start the tapering process on Sunday with a weighing scale & a few of the most highly recommended supplements. Including: 
1)L-Theanine
2) Agmatine
3) CBD 
4) Magnesium 
5) N-Acetyl Cystein/Vit-B Complex/L-Tyrosine
6)Black Seed Oil

For Sleep: 1)Valerian Root Extract 2)Melatonin & 3)Kava Kava 

I’m an athlete that initially started using K for performance anxiety & now the dang thing has me in its grips. Of course I have to still be able to function as I endure this process and lift/train every single day. So if you can find it in you, all prayers are welcomed to help me stay on track with my playing career. 

For Taper: I’m planning on starting at 20gpd then reducing by .25g each day. 
You can find the taper method I’m using on kickkratom.com - there’s tons of great info on there
(Most of those supplements I listed are recommended from that site as well) 

Anyways, I hope that everyone reading this is either having success kicking this thing to the curb, or in great spirits planning to do so just like me. 

Still looking for a little more advice/tips/tricks I may not have listed that can help me through this process. And would also like some recommendations as far as when the best time to take each supplement is. 
Also, as always, good vibes & encouragement are welcome.

Restless legs, body aches, insomnia, that mentality that feels like you're going insane... all that. Now that it's been about a week and I've just about leveled off, I'm removing .5 gpd and I hardly notice anything at all!

Every 4 hrs I take 2g, so 6am, 10am, 2pm, 6pm, 10pm, making sure not to dose early or late, even if I'm feeling okay because I'll regret it and screw up the taper.

Next day I took 1.9g every 2 hrs (9.5g total). Didn't notice anything

Day after that 1.8g (9g), and so on

Now I'm on 7gpd and it's going really smoothly and I still feel a buzz about a half hr after each use. It would have been easier to do that initially from the 25gpd but I'm glad I dropped and got it over with. If you guys are taking that much, you could probably drop a whole gram each day and not notice until it starts getting to the low amounts. Anyway, I'm almost there. 

If I can do it, anyone can! Good luck!",10

Longtime lurker here. Hope everyone is well. I've been using kratom for \~ two years now. Daily for six/seven months. It's become a MAJOR problem and is inhibiting me in more ways than one. I am not going to divulge the whole story, only because it is so similar to many I've read here. 

I've never struggled with an addiction this gripping. I've used other drugs quite a bit, but have always been able to control my intake for the most part, and not let it run rampant. But I think the ease of acquiring (buy it at the cornerstore), ease of hiding, and the fear of how I'll feel without it is making the quit so difficult.

I need to be held accountable for using and am going to keep this page updated with the process. I plan on quitting tomorrow.

I used to be so productive, so creative. I've fallen so far and feel hopeless at times. It's time to work my ass off. Hope everyone is staying strong.

Talk soon,

So a little back story. I quit taking Oxys about two years ago. Was taking 30-60mgs a day for a year on and off. I’d quit every couple months and go through withdrawal and stay sober for a month or so and start taking them again. 


So about two weeks ago I was in a shop getting CBD for back pain help and the guy said if you want some help with back pain add in Kratom. So I did and I couldn’t believe how well it worked so I ordered 50 mg of red Borneo. 

Fast forward to this past Monday. I had been taking about 3-4 grams 3 times a day for about 8 days. I didn’t even have two weeks of use and here I am day two after stopping and feel like I ate oxys again and feel like absolute shit. 

Is this even possible?

* I need to walk, it's hard to be still
* I feel restlessness throughout the body (not visible, it's inside)
* I am nervous
* I am scared to solve problems and don't want to speak with anyone
* I need to force eat, because I can't enjoy it.. feel empty stomach, but I'am not hungry
* If episode hits afternoon I can't sleep

..the symptoms last all day and sometime to next morning.. then they go away for one day.. then I feel good, but .. next day it's back. And this is over and over again.  It's so grueling!! Up and down.. Up and down.. 

I am male 40yo .. caffeine free 3 months,  I do not drink sweetened drinks, I am eating healthy, excercising, but weight losting. Only vaping - MTL 6mg of nicotine. I have no drug or addiction history.. before Kratom  I drank alcohol, but only beers, not liquers. Smoked weed 2x per year.. Last week I ask my dr for blood and hormonest test.. so I am waiting for results.

Trying L-theanine, Valerian root, lot of camomile tea, Magnesium, C vitamine, Omega 3. But it not helps. 

Normal day I am not use suplements.. only multivitamine.. and camomile tea.

Physicaly I am ok, no pain, no headaches, nothing .. only tension and depresion inside if I am down.

**What is it? It is typical anxiety?** 

**Can it be hormonal hormonal imbalance?**

I don't know if is it low dopamine or low serotonine. So I quit L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan, because dopamine is booster I think and I need to calm down, not boost energy.

Figured it would join again since I'm currently about 12 hrs into day 4 CT coming off of about 60 gpd along with 3g extract per day.

I don't recognize any of the regulars here anymore, last time I was here was during a quit when I went to Switzerland in 2017 or 2018?  Every trip I have been on in the last 6 or so years has been an attempted quit, but every time I get back home after 10 days or so, I'm always back to it. I can't even count the number of times I've attempted to quit, but I have been an on and off user since 2012 (holy shit, typing that is fucking terrifying)

This time feels more real. I'm feeling like I have a stronger willpower since I am doing it from my house with a shop a 5 min walk away, instead of a mandatory detox due to flying out of the country or something.

Anyway, feeling realtively good. First few days were pretty bad with the normal stuff (chills, fatigue, rls, feeling like I couldn't move my body but having the urge to move every 2 seconds, etc), but today feels pretty good. Got a good amount of sleep last night (likely thanks to a little bit if old gabapentin I had) and woke up today with some anxiety and sneezing but not much else. Body still feels a little heavy, but it isn't too bad. Also ate my first full meal last night at 10pm, which felt good.

Hope everyone else out there is doing ok!

Edit: I'm now realizing that I've had a bunch of ""quits"" after Switzerland including a trip to Italy in 2018, a trip to Portland in 2018, and a trip to Virginia in 2019. That 2017 trip was just the last time I posted here (under a different account). Fuck, feels bad to realize that.",3

But I like what I see. Sure my hairs a wreck, and I haven't been taking care of myself as I normally do, or going to the gym or any of that stuff since kratom withdrawal turned me into a blob of depressed jelly! But in my face something looks brighter and less ragged. I thought I was just aging hard and fast - I mean I am aging but apparently it was with a little help from my friend, K. Of course, the thought passed through my mind that it could be from kratom, but I just didn't, couldn't, wouldn't believe it! Like an abusive spouse, I didn't want to believe that they were really that bad! It's really astonishing what I let kratom do to me. It was like turning on the radio so I didn't have to hear the upstairs bathtub filling up with water and getting ready to run over and ruin the house. I just kept turning up that radio louder for 2 yrs+ - Phew!

Today is day 5 for me CT. Actually had a really rough week, mentally with a lot of stressful things happening. Like totally out of the norm (atleast for me) stressful things - car needed to be towed, toaster almost lit my kitchen on fire, and SUPER busy LONNNGGG days at work. It’s kind of been a blessing and a curse. In some instances I have been instinctively going to where I used to store my kratom but then I catch myself. The feelings are fleeting though, lucky, because I’ve been busy. 

This morning everything kind of came to a head and I felt I was on the verge of an anxiety attack. But then I kind of calmed myself down and realized I need to accept everything for what it is. Yes it’s been an abnormally stressful week for me and normally I’d lean into kratom to help me “feel better” but I’m not doing that anymore. I also realize these feeling are amplified by me withdrawing and that is also something I tell myself in order to accept. I can get through this. I’m accepting and embracing these emotions.",8

Symptoms: 
Severe pain in one leg, comparable to a deep quad tear. Like your bone and thigh are on fire. (Not RLS, very intense pain).
Also, pressure/heaviness in the chest. Like there's a buring knot in the upper chest in combination with sharp isolated pains outside of pecs. Chest pain goes on for days in a row. Facial spasms.

Use:
Total use 11 years, but 2 years off (during that time he used hydrocodone, which he doesn't use anymore). He doesn't keep very good track of how much he is taking, but he thinks about 30-40 mpd, but possibly 50 at times. He uses more now than he has used in the past.

History:
A few months ago, he genuinely thought he might be having a heart attack and went to the hospital, did a EKG only to be told he was totally healthy. He did a CT scan later, also normal. Eventually they said they thought maybe it was a sinus infection. A few days later all symptoms went away. Then a few nights ago, I woke up to him in the hall whimpering. I thought he was having a night terror, but instead he told me he couldn't walk and his left leg was in severe pain. It was really fucking scary. I never see this guy cry in pain, and he was. Eventually it mostly subsided, but neither of us went back to sleep because I started speculating that this was somehow related to kratom and was finding the evidence to back it up. It was like going down a rabbit hole once we started reading stuff. I insisted he go to the doctor that morning. They did a urine analysis and EKG. Again, all normal. They told him he need to taper down gradually and carefully. Then that same day, the chest pain crap started happening again just like when he thought he was having a heart attack months ago. He also has facial spasms. We were kinda thinking the chest pain was indigestion caused from drinking too much OJ with kratom, but maybe not? Anyone experience anything like this?

Finally, even though I spent years suggesting that kratom could be doing harm to him, he's really worried and wants to quit. Really he doesn't even want to taper, he just wants to CT, but can't because he's scared of what might happen and can't take the time off work. He is going to get a scale, follow the guidelines on how to taper.

Eventually went to rehab for unrelated reasons 1.5-2 yrs later (had a bad benzo blackout due to inaccurate dosing, rehab was basically only way to save my ass). And when I was in rehab, I experienced so little withdrawals...I'm talking back to normal within 2-3 days with only strong symptom being body temperature. Ended up getting back on it with current gf of mine, but she CT'd it and basically talked some sense into me. So I dumped the rest of my kilo out in the lake the following day.

I am now on Day 2 and this is horrible. SO much harder than it was in rehab which makes me think this is all a mental battle since I know a cheap 3oz bag is a 10 minute drive away. And it's so goddamn tempting. I keep getting impending doom apocalyptic vibes especially with this coronavirus scare. My body temperature is constantly fluctuating. I have absolutely no happiness. AT ALL. Nothing brings me joy. My room is a mess and the only thing that slightly helps is driving with music. The RLS isn't that bad but will get moments where I'm uncontrollably fidgety. I totally thought I had this but I'm not so sure anymore. 

When will this end? Did you eventually muster up a motivation again? Will this come back naturally after physical symptoms end? Or is there eventually a point where you have to overcome it through sheer will?",11

Every couple of days, after wd goes away, he'd drop .2 from each dose, or 1.2 total. Now that he's in these low doses, he barely gets wd when he drops the amount. If you want to taper, you must get a scale and go slow and steady. Jimmy tried dropping the dose by whole teaspoons at a time- too much, didn't work. Firstly, the teaspoon is a very inexact measurement. Secondly, it's about 2.5 grams, which he found to be too drastic of a reduction to avoid anxiety and wd.

Main reason I want to quit is because I really destroyed my digestion and the organs on the left side of my body really don't feel right. Also my highlight of the day was Kratom only and during the last half year I would even go to bed at 8 PM or 9PM just so I could have my Kratom turn faster the next day. 
I gave all my Kratom to a mate, telling him not to give it back because throwing it away just leaves a bitter feeling.
So since quitting I experience sleep trouble because under the blanket I get way too hot but when I take the blanket off partially I get too cold. I tried everything using a lighter blanket opening/closing window, but in the end I wake up once in the night having to change my shirt because it is too wet. 
I also exercise a lot in the evening and I mean real exercising with two friends, one was in the army and we do circle training in the park. 
Exercising definitely is the best way to have a satisfying feeling at the end of the day without Kratom but the sleep problem is still there.

Seems really slow to me, like im not making enough progress. Now im finding that 15gpd is just not enough and im constantly fighting with my brain to not take more than that. And usually my kratom brain suceeds in getting me to take more. Im starting to go the opposite way with my taper and feel absolutely hopeless. Im already at 14 grams today, my daily allotment, and im about to go and take another 7 gram dose making it 21 today and its only barely 3pm. I feel terrified of going CT and the pain and suffering I would have to endure, but at this point I feel like it might be the only way to once and for all stop taking this shit. Im terrified of what my brain will be screaming at me if I do, but im just so sick of letting myself down and dissapointing myself by taking extra. I feel so weak minded, if I cant even stick to a taper how would I be able to go CT? 

Does anyone else have this struggle with the taper? What can I do to convince my brain and body to just suck it up and feel the uncomfortableness once and for all? Im worried that the kratom is going to beat me and ill be stuck, trapped, taking this stuff forever. I feel like im in a living nightmare that is me feeling better when I take it, and unbearable when I dont. Is it my brain? Am I mentally ill? Maybe there is something wrong my my dopamine/reward system because without taking this stuff I feel like im doomed.

I’ve been using Kratom for about 5 years. Longest I didn’t use was 3 days in the beginning and after experiencing WD symptoms got back on. I typically have a every 2 hours half a tea spoon toss and wash (white plastic spoon) from 7 am to about 930 at night. So about 8 of those a day not sure what that equals to GPD. Anyways after 12 years I decided that I would get back on ADD meds due to high stress jobs and inability to focus. (I actually have a problem this isn’t recreational I just didn’t like the way it made me feel when I was young) Long story it’s been a week now and I significantly cut back on my Kratom use. Now it’s about 1/4 of a spoon every 4-5 hours. I notice my body feeling the change in wanting to crash around 1pm or so and body aching. I’m accepting that pain and discomfort will happen but as far as laziness and depression I’m worried about. My goal is to basically use my ADD meds to help contract the WD symptoms when I cut it out completely this weekend. I’m hoping someone here has experience with this and has pointers on what they thing is the best course of action to stop ASAP.

Length of time used: 16-18 months

Was trying to quit weed at the same, given that I think it may also be part of my problem (used for 13 years, was probably masking/coping my actual anxiety/depression). However, last night I caved in and took a couple vape hits and then a short while later, took a couple small drags out of a bowl. Ultimately, this did not make me feel any better. I eneded up laying down to sleep with a heart pounding, thankfully I think my Trazodone 100mg prescription helped put me to sleep. I did end up tossing and turning a bit...and also had a nightmare. Funny, just yesterday I made a comment saying that I would be less likely to turn to weed because of the anxiety I got last time from it.......welp. I'm learning. Slowly. Lol.

Woke up today, with a little more brain fog than the past few days and a noticeable lack of pink clouding that had been there prior for the most part. I'm scheduled to meet with a therapist tomorrow...first meeting is gonna be a comprehensive 2 hour questioning segment where I just get asked a bunch of questions and the therapist builds a profile on/for me.

Trying to get a handle on my anxiety. I was prescribed some buspar...but I had some insurance complications and I'm now waiting for a 7-10 day window where I get my insurance paper I.D. mailed to me. I think I definitely need to get on an SSRI...and from what I've read buspar seems like a solid one as it doesn't seem to carry much weight...it either works for you or it doesn't with little to no side effects (could be wrong, but that's what I've read).

I feel like if I get a hold of my anxiety, which shot through the roof in retrospect while on K, that everything else will fall into place for me. At this point, I have NO DESIRE to take kratom. No cravings. I do get the crave to smoke though and I just need to fight through it!

Anyone have any experience they would like to share with regards to anxiety lowering after stopping use of Kratom?",4

I was just taking it all day every day. And waking up every morning at 5 am in withdrawals until I took my morning dose. Those pre-K mornings were \*the\* reason I quit. Even though I felt like garbage, I could feel tiny little signs of the real me peeking out, rather than some fake happiness over nothing that lasted about 1/2 hour to an hour before I wanted to take more. So even though I feel horrible, I do not have any desire to take it again. After a quick, drastic 4-day taper, I jumped ship and this is now my 12th Day w/out any K. The main symptoms I'm having now are lethargy - I'm literally too tired to stand while while peeing (I'm a guy) so I sit. I even have been sitting on the floor of the shower! Like that's how weak I feel. Also terrible malaise - just discomfort/pain/weakness that's hard to pinpoint but leaves me feeling ""not right"" weather I'm sitting, lying down or whatever. And as far as my interests - nothing! I have a lot of things I'm usually into - horror movies, 3D etc.. none of these feel like anything to me yet. I really hope that comes back because I miss that most of all. My brain cannot handle any stress whatsoever or even any kind of anything - I've been watching stuff like The Smurfs (the old 80's cartoon series) because that's about all my brain can handle. My stomach issues are still sticking around too and my appetite is nowhere near normal yet. I don't feel physically sick like I did in the first week. It literally felt like the worst flu I've ever had. I know everyone says ""go to the gym"" and I'm someone who usually goes to the gym 4-5x a week, but I just cannot yet. I forced myself to go one day last week when I was having a better than average day for whatever reason and it really only made me feel weaker. Minute-by-minute but no green sludge!",13
2020-03-03 10:44:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fcweu6/did_i_just_get_lucky/,Did I just get lucky?,"So I have been taking kratom off and on since 2011. I first read about it online and I think I had to be one of the early adopters of it... I even would capsule it up myself and sell it to friends in little sand which baggies for five bucks. Anyway I broke my hip about two years ago, (on an electric skateboard) and couldn’t really walk at all for a year, that’s when my kratom usage really ramped up. Daily I must’ve been taking between 30-50 grams. My urine would start to smell, I would get muscle cramps, breath and asshole would reek, and I would say to myself “now I really need to quit”. But I never really could do it. The withdrawals were too bad.
      So my brother who I live with, split another three kilos in the past two months or so and then I started getting weird problems with my ears and facial tics... it started that my ears would feel plugged or something and then one of them would rumble, or start ringing like pressure was being put on them. Then I started noticing when I was in a quiet room one or both of my ears would be making white noise or even full on ringing. It got to the point where my right ear basically rings loud anytime I’m in a quiet room. If I am stressed out it will ring even louder. I’ve never had tinnitus before, and at first I didn’t even connect it with kratom but after a quick google search it’s definitely from kratom. From what I’ve read it could even be permanent and if you continue to use kratom you could lose hearing and have to wear hearing aids! So I decided to quit cold turkey two days ago, and of course the first night was hell, I only slept maybe two or three hours, and I said a prayer and asked Jesus to make me whole and reborn and good and all of that. (I hardly ever pray only when I’m scared shitless or fucked) and I’ve got to say this second day is going just fine. I slept like ten hours last night. Hardly any symptoms, honestly I feel like a new man. I’ve been through withdrawals so many times on all sorts of drugs so maybe I’m just conditioned to them, but honestly I can’t tell if I just got lucky or maybe Jesus is real and sent me some love! Cause I feel pretty good! I know it’s just the beginning and some harder times could manifest and PAWS and all of that, but for the time being I am over the acute stage! Hallelujah!",5

I'm a part of Benzobuddies which is a support forum for, as you could probably guess, benzo withdrawal. I'm so happy to see other communities like this cropping up and spreading hope. If you're suffering from withdrawals, know it gets better. You'll feel better than you have in years if you just give it time and treat you mind and body as you would treat your loved ones. Good luck!

So I'm currently in PAWS from benzodiazepine withdrawal. It has been a miserable 9 year relationship with benzos and the last three years I've produced some clean time but only to relapse during stressful situations. This time I am done for good, but the withdrawals are... I don't know how to describe them, but they are unspeakably horrific. At the risk of sounding like a drama queen, they have destroyed my life.

Now I found out some people use kratom for benzo PAWS management, and I tried it and it worked quite well. It didn't take away the symptoms but it has allowed me to stay a little more sane during it all. I've now been taking 2.6g doses 2-3 times daily for just over four months, alternating between green and red of different strains. I never take more than 8 grams a day.

I guess my question is about the mechanisms of kratom withdrawal and if they will effect my benzo withdrawal?  I always thought kratom was a mu-opioid agonist, but I'm reading that it has a cocktail effect on the brain. I'm wondering if there's any crossover and if I've mistakenly set my benzo withdrawal back, as benzo withdrawal is an incredibly delicate healing process. One misstep with titration and it can set you back weeks for some.

Does anyone know about the mechanisms? Or even just some anecdotal experience with this? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",1

Here's my dosage from 2/1/20 until today:

30g > 35 > 35 > 35 > 37 > 48 > 34 > 50g > 35 > 25 > 31 > 41 > 20 > 17 > 24 > 20 > 21 > 12 > 15 > 11 > 11 > 9 > 7 > 6 > 4 > 4 > 4 > 4 > 4 > 4.5g SV > 

Basically the day I only took 12g I decided it was time. As I'm sure you know, some days are harder than others, CHOOSE AN EASY DAY TO START OR JUMP. I am now down to ONLY 4.5g stem and vein, roughly 1-2 gram(s) regular leaf, according to other posters!

I can repeat everything that's been said on here (it steals your personality/life, I feel myself coming back to life etc.), but I thought I'd try and add something new. The hardest part for me (so far) has been the complete lethargy.. literally my legs feel like anchors. I run everyday, no exceptions.. but the last 3 days I can barely bring my walk to a jog, I go 2 blocks then I see old men with walkers lapping me, this isn't an exaggeration btw.

Anyway.. I have been taking low to medium dose adderall during the worst of it and/or when I need to get things done, mostly work. This isn't for everyone and the dosage will differ for everyone. I have a bit of a tolerance to it, so for me it is 10-15mg. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVERDO IT, it can worsen withdrawal symptoms in higher doses (anxiety, shakes etc..). For me it's self regulating, so I won't take higher doses due to the consequences. Titrate up until you find that sweet spot. So far it has been a godsend. Anything that can take you out of the pits with little consequence is a good thing imho. 

Feel free to ask questions. This forum has helped me immensely, I thank you all. If this post helps just one person, it was well worth it for me :)",5

I'm sick of it making my brain foggy! I'm sick of buying it! SICK OF IT! at this point I'm taking it to be normal just like heroine addicts!! Idk why but Every time I quit the physical symptoms are unbearable! ZERO Sleep! RLS from hell!! Aches, pains burning legs, skin crawling - I can't function,can't sleep, can't work and relapse! 
I don't have health insurance so there's no gabapentin or prescription drugs I can use it has to be all OTC things! I've tried it ALL ! One time I quit for a couple weeks with Lope! 
Recently I tried with bunk stem and vein from my crappy vendor! Absolute junk! I told them it was junk! They said send it back and they would ""talk"" to quality control!! Lmfao! It's a mom n pop place? Who the hell does quality control?? Pop? 
Seriously?! When I read these forums I don't understand how everyone can take time off work? I can't! And I can't do physical wd in 2 days! I think the lack of sleep exacerbates RLS and makes it worse! At least 5 days physical w/d for me? 
Just venting! When I started this everyone said addictive as caffeine what a JOKE!! LIE LIE LIE!!
If you read this try to stop as soon as you can bc before you know it 10 years will have gone by! I think it is easier the less time you've been taking it. In my opinion w/o scripts and w/o being able to take a week or two off work/school ..the only way is slow taper! Sounds easier than what it is! Very easy to just say ...I'll start next week! Or today was a bad day I need more etc etc 
Cold turkey, in a cabin in the middle of no where w/o a vehicle or $ is the way to go if you can do it! 
In my case the physical w/d is more than I can bare! I have rheumatoid arthritis in hands and feet ...it's like it knows when I stop taking it to go right for my Achilles heel! First things that become unbearable hands and feet!! I go as long as I can...then give in!! 
It really does help if someone knows that you are quitting and you have support! Even that's a stretch bc if they've never done it or gone through it they have NO IDEA! and they will read online crap saying coffee addiction and think your crazy and a sissy!! 
Idk if there's hope for me! I wish you all the best of luck! The longer you take it in large quantities the WORSE it will be ...if you do stop? NEVER EVER touch it again!",8

It’s a amazing feeling not having to worry about dosing waking up feeling like crap because you need to dose. Yesterday went to church, grocery store, cooked dinner, even organized my sons closet. It feels good to be able to contribute to these things instead of my husband having to do it all. I will never EVERY touch kratom again. I even stopped smoking cigarettes. I’ve been a heaving smoker for over 20 years (started at 15). I can’t even stand the small of it let alone the taste of it. All I’m taking is one a day vitamin, B12 and vitamin C. I would’ve never thought in million years that I would kick this habit. Like I said in my previous post the first 3-4 day were hard but the reward is sooooo worth it. Take back your life, take back your home, take back your marriage/relationship, take back YOUR LIFE!!!!",23

Jumped at 18gpd , 4.5 years taking it 4-8x daily. The first week I was off work , it wasn’t too bad. Even felt ok enough to play video game with a friend. Had nasty restless arms and legs, sweating , some insomnia, anxiety about real life things increased, heavy fatigue, but also a clarity and relief that I was finally quitting. 

The second week some physical things subsided , but still trouble sleeping some nights and rls . Was on a nice tropical vacation, great to have when recovering. 

Third week back to work, definitely some struggles. Lots of sneezing still but it’s gone down. 

My energy level and motivation is still low, have fatigue/laziness. I have to force myself to do things and it’s uncomfortable. My body feels older with more pain. Work can be very trying and tiring but feel good after I come home knowing I pushed thru it. 

My sense of humor is better and I’m less irritable. Maybe more sociable a little. I wake up in the morning feeling my “endorphin system”  working, a nice glow I didn’t have for years. 

I’ve given exercise about 4 chances this month. It’s something I want to start but I didn’t like exhausting myself for very little reward and soreness. Something I hope to overcome. 

I’ve also cut phenibut slowly the past month, been on it same time as k, from about 1g to now about 5-600mg. This may be a bigger problem to quit than k , I’ll find out soon. So far it’s hard to notice. 

I also cut down nicotine during the past month. I wish I would have just quit, I find myself feeling shittier after doing more of it , days I take less I’ve felt better. 

I’m very relieved I’m not dependent on it anymore. It has been worth the struggle. Overall, I expected the first week to be worse than it was, but I expected to be feeling better by now than I am at day 30.",5

Though I had found a miracle plant that could help me socialize and ease my PMDD symptoms that were tearing my life apart. But when I found medication for that issue I kept taking it to help me with school and before I knew it I was wasting time and money. My life revolves around avoiding withdrawal and taking my next dose. I’ve been this way for about a year now and I can’t take it anymore. It has robbed me of myself.  I put down the bottle 5 years ago with the help of my now husband. Now, with his help again, I am going to defeat this. He took my ID this morning (my idea) and only gave me enough money to pay what bills and errands needed paying and I will keep the receipts. He knows I have been struggling and that I have tried to quit before. We know what is coming with the sleepless nights, the irritability and lack of motivation. I got myself tapered down but found it impossible to take the jump as my mind was screaming at me for more. I am on my spring break now and don’t have to work so I’m hoping this will be the last time I attempt to quit. 

I wish everyone the best and I will be here throughout the duration, even if I’m not posting. This is a great sub and I’m so glad I’ve found you all.",5

My hair is looking healthier & the dark circles under my eyes don’t take as much concealer. My complexion has the color of life again. I still have 30lbs to lose but I’m actually motivated to workout again, so I will get it off. 

I was the healthiest person when I began my journey w/ K, I practiced grounding, drank homemade turmeric teas, ate biodynamic produce, took great supplements, weight trained, ect. I researched holistic treatment for my depression, that’s what led me to K. Now I realize that the K only put a mask over what I was feeling & made me blind to the damage it was inflicting on my mind & body under the guise of help. It literally turned me into the most unhealthy version of myself & I was too obsessed w/ the green sludge to care. 

I am so relieved I am thinking clearly again. I will never go back. Push through it & reclaim your life, you’re worth it.",58

It worked, made me hyper and optimistic, been trying to taper off.

As I lower my dosage (now at 10g/day) I find it impossible to get much sleep. I go to bed super tired, think I'm gonna fall asleep, then suddenly it feels like my cerebellum is on fire and I lie there half-awake the entire night, dreaming lucidly. I do get some REM's in and wake up energized enough, take my caffeine, take the Maeng Da White and it's off to the races again.

Around 2pm I get unbearable spells of fatigue where I just can't function. Followed by yet another spike of energy, followed by yet more fatigue, then I go to ""sleep"", sleep for maybe 4 hours and then the cycle begins anew.

My energy levels are just all over the place and totally unpredictable.

Oddly, if I take very high doses, it is much easier to sleep. 

I don't know what to do I am fully cracked out on this stuff if I go CT I literally get suicidal and can't function at all.

On the upside, I am someone who is a fitness maniac and works out very frequently so I know I can defeat this with enough exercise.",7

2020-03-02 06:05:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fcai3p/one_week/,One Week,"I’ll finish up day 7 later today -  but I’m at work now anyway and will be till that point so I’ll definitely get there. I posted a couple days ago - sorry for any repetition. For one, I used a lot and used it every day for three years. The longest I went without was one Thursday night to the following Monday morn. I knew I needed to quit for about the last 9 months and like so many others, I wanted to and didn’t want to. But a couple things that threw me over the edge was the lack of erection and the mere fact that it just didn’t work anymore. Someone posted a few days back that they relapsed after several weeks and their tolerance hasn’t even reset itself. I fully believe that. So I say those couple things to say I gave in fully to the quitting - surprisingly - which I believe made all the difference in the world. It has not been hard. I can tell that the long term temptation can certainly be deceptive and could get someone, but the truth is I just can’t sacrifice sex for it. Can’t do it. My eyesight is better, my sleep is better, my neediness is better. It doesn’t absolutely have to be hard so don’t assume it has to be - I know it is for a lot of people, but most of us posting posted bc of the fact we had problems. The ones without them probably don’t post as much. (I came here because I was freaked out about a lack of erections - other than that, I haven’t had many problems). One exception to that is that I have had some GI stuff, but it isn’t that bad. I would suggest low fruit, in conjunction with that. Fruit is a diuretic and will only compound that problem. I suggest a carnivore or close to that type diet: high fat, high meat, low carb. Low carb diets help with addiction and helps level you out to a steady state. To some this may sound crazy; it’s not. Do a lot of reading and don’t simply believe the propaganda telling you otherwise. Read a history of our evolution and the ice age we survived for 2 1/2 million years and what we almost exclusively ate during that time. Another good thing to report, is that I haven’t even drank. I fell in love with kratum bc it felt great, but also bc I totally stopped drinking. At some point drinking just didn’t sound like as much fun and it still quite isn’t. I have hit some weed a couple of nights, but haven’t in any sense relied on it. 

So, main points are these: it isn’t certain that if you quit it will be hard. Stay as low carb as you can and this will help. Commit fully to quitting bc Kratom basically forces you to quit anyway bc it stops working. 

Good luck",4

Amount: 9-10 gpd (a small amount I know, but the daily use over a year has had its effect on me)

My anxiety has been worse today than it has been the past couple days...but better than the beginning of the detox. In my first post in this subreddit, I stated that I was also quitting weed and Iending up caving in and vaping some one night when I was 4 days clean of weed, now I'm back to day 2 of no weed. I wish I would have kept going with no weed as it ended up giving me some anxiety that night (despite it increasing my appetite for the better).

Today I woke up and felt a bit groggy ( I had taken a Trazodone 100mg pill, which I now have a prescription for) but after calling and talking to my father for around 45 minutes, I felt better. I am thankful to have support like that.

Which brings me to my anxiety this evening...I surmise that it is because I am anticipating tomorrow where my gf goes back to work (although it's only 4 hours at night 5-9, I am just anticipating it feeling like an eternity, especially because she was able to get last week of work off to be here for me, I have been talking to her A LOT to help me calm down when I am having high anxiety and now that there is gonna be a period where I know I won't have her tomorrow...I'm struggling a bit. I know she HAS to go back to work and that I HAVE to cope alone.

I have a prescription for Buspar as well that I just received but haven't filled it yet because I need some more information from my insurance company before I can get it...so I need to make a phone call or two tomorrow as well. I start therapy on wednesday with a recommended therapist. Pretty sure its CBT.

Some things that have been helping a bit; journaling, listening to music, going for a walk, talking with others, mindfulness about what I'm going through, reading/posting through this subreddit (although sometimes I wonder if it triggers me?)

I have some ashwagandha on the way and I am thinking about picking up some valerian root and maybe magnesium tonight?

OVERALL: I am doing MUCH better than the beginning days. 1-4 in particular. I feel like today is a bit of a step backwards than yesterday but I am trying to remember the tools I have at my disposal that help me and a reminder that quitting kratom is NOT a linear process...which is such a bitch lol. Also want to say that to those in this fight...YOU GOT THIS SHIT. FUCK KRATOM. HERE'S TO A BETTER FUTURE!",1

I have been using Kratom for over two years now. I initially started to help stop drinking alcohol. Last year I was in a really bad traffic accident and broke several vertebrae in my spine. 9 months later and I am doing amazingly well almost fully recovered. I definitely upped my intake of Kratom to between 8 and 12 heaping teaspoons a day. It was very useful in helping my healing process and alleviating pain. Recently I have been very concerned over my lack of sex drive and discovering that Kratom is the most likely culprit it has strengthened my desire to be done with it. Even before learning this I had decided to taper a bit as I felt I was no longer functioning very well with so much intake. I am down to 4 teaspoons spread out throughout the day and am just now on day three. I figure that in a week I will taper once more and then go cold turkey. I hope to have a rise in libido soon and just wanted to post this to help keep myself accountable as well as open myself up to feedback. Thank you for taking the time to read this.,5

Scientists think that stimulating the skin and underlying tissues with heat activates serotonin-releasing cells in the brain. A neurotransmitter regulating mood, appetite, sleep, and motivation, serotonin is also vital to enhancing feelings of well-being and happiness.

People diagnosed with depression, anxiety, seasonal affective disorder, and panic disorder have significantly lower than normal levels of serotonin. This is why doctors routinely prescribe antidepressants for increasing serotonin levels in the brain. 

Thankfully, several studies suggest that regular sauna use can help with mental health symptoms related to:
