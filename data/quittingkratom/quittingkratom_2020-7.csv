Down to about 1/2-2/3 of what my intake was this time last year. I think its time to induce a rapid taper.,"I've used kratom for 2 years as of about a month ago. Ive quit a couple times for a few days at a time, my last quit was about 1 year ago.

&#x200B;

ive realised how much kratom puts life on fast forward. Weeks seem like a couple days, months seem like weeks, im so sick of having my time and emotional energy stolen from me.

&#x200B;

About 6 months ago i made a serious decision to taper down and eventually jump off, the last 6 months have flashed by, i feel like its only been 3 months. Thats the messed up thing with kratom, its not just an opioid but it also acts as a stimulant and sedative too.

&#x200B;

I have a kilo of red bali coming in the mail tomorrow - the least stimulant/psychoactive outside of  the opioid properties. Its Tim to go for a rapid taper. I  am going to go completely withoput kratom till my package arrives about 12-14 hours from now, then i ma going to take 1/3-1/2 of my dose , so around 2.5-3g, as infrequently as possible.

&#x200B;

I absolutely HATE the fog that kratom puts me in now, before it was an escape from reality, but now i have a life that I love and its just not worth it anymore.

&#x200B;

I am going to recede into the online rpg ive been playing,and i have a decent support circle in my closest friends

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Its time to come back to reality and take control of myself and my emotions again. Kratom almost makes me feel like im emotionally and mentally trapped in a cage when im under its effects

&#x200B;

ill be checking in here, thanks for the previous positive encouragement and thanks for maintaining this community.

This site has been inspiring to me, and got me thinking about what's at the CORE of my habit. Which, I was hoping could help explain why it's so tough to quit!?

Well, I've struggled with pretty bad depression for most of my life. And I started taking Kratom, bc it lifted my mood a little, but it got out of control! At this point, I've weaned down to about 12-15gpd.

I am a person who ALREADY had depression, so quitting, would be like taking an antidepressant away from someone who's already struggling. AND, before I can go back to my baseline amount of depression, I'll be required to go through an EVEN MORE depressing period, of withdrawals!

I wish I had an actual question, so someone could just give me an ""answer,"" but this is more of a statement I guess.

Anyone have any thoughts, advice, comments?.. I'm isolated and alone through this, so thanks for reading.",4,0

I’ve been taking Kratom for 2 years, up to 45 g/day for a long time. Now I’m down to about 20 g/day and am very mentally ready to quit. My doctor is prescribing Clonodine patches for the core withdrawal symptoms and Hydroxyzine for sleep. I’ve been addicted to opiates in the past and struggle with depression and chronic pain.

Sleep is something I’ve very worried about since I have always had bad insomnia and I have a chronic pain issue which gets worse if I am not getting proper sleep. I was expecting them to prescribe Ativan/Xanax which would have made me feel better, but me getting good sleep is what is important so if the Hydroxyzine helps I’m fine with that. It’s more that I’m skeptical it will help after 2 years of a big Kratom and weed* dose at bedtime every single night. At one point I was taking close to 20 grams of K at once before bed. Now it’s more like 8. Setting aside the 2 years worth of apocalyptic kratom hangovers I’ve had WAY fewer problems actually falling and staying asleep during my use of K. I used to toss and turn all night which was extremely unpleasant. Kratom was very effective in covering up that discomfort and now I’m scared that it is all going to come back - that I’m going to go into a spiral of insomnia, pain and depression.

Does this resonate with anyone or is this a niche problem within the quitting kratom space? How did you guys get through this part?

Also does anyone have experience using medication to help the transition? She also mentioned Suboxone as a backup option but I’d like to avoid that.

I’ve pretty much eliminated all caffeine in hopes that it would help but not so much. Currently been up 36 hours and feel not even tired lol. Shit is getting OLD. Not old enough to bring me back to kratom but definitely need to figure something out. My mom is giving me some lunesta to try tonight which I’m not really a fan of sleep meds but ya boy gonna go insane if this shit lasts much longer. Don’t wanna scare anyone that are contemplating jumping because I think this is not very common and I still believe whole heartedly that getting off the k was and is still the move.

I lurk on here often and the third week was by far the hardest mentally. Hopefully I wake up tomorrow and I’m feeling alright. I look at recovery as not always being a linear process. This is just a bump in the road.

I've been a kratom user for around 3 years. I spent the last year with a more-or-less daily habit. Not much, usually 3 grams, but no higher than 5 grams, once a day. I feel blessed that less than 5g/day was enough for me, as I've read some horror stories about people going thru withdrawals after 20g, 30g, 50g, 80g/day habits....

I'm about 3 1/2 weeks into a cold-turkey quit. I haven't really had any withdrawal symptoms, other than some restless legs during the first week, and just a general yearning for the emotional comfort that kratom gave me...nothing to write home about.

However, for the past 24 hours, I've developed some tingling in my hands. This happened to me once before, back in March when I came down with a bad flu. I stopped taking kratom for about 3 or 4 days, because it dehydrated me terribly and made me feel worse by the time I came down. The sensation slowly spread over the course of those 4 days, from my hands to my feet and finally to my face. So, I went to the doctor to find an explanation - she told me I don't have a kidney or liver problem, I don't have fibromyalgia, and although I'm a just wee bit on the portly side, I'm not diabetic. My doctor thought it could maybe be a pinched nerve (fat guys don't have the best posture), and she prescribed me a steroid - methylprednisone. It did its job, and the numbing/tingling sensation went away within a week, and I resumed my daily kratom habit.

Now, that feeling is back. It's only been present for about 24 hours, and it hasn't spread beyond my palms and fingers. Since I know I don't have a kidney/liver problem, and I haven't suddenly become diabetic in 4 months time, I'm wondering if this is a withdrawal symptom. I've come across a couple other threads with people discussing it, but I can't find anything definite. I'm also worried it could be nerve damage that I only have noticed after quitting kratom (as kratom may have numbed or otherwise covered up the sensation while I was taking it every day). It doesn't make much sense to me that I would only start developing the tingling over 3 weeks after quitting, but I'm not a doctor.

My question is, has anybody had this tingling in the hands/feet/face after quitting kratom? If so, how far into your quit did it start, and how long did it last? Did you take a steroid, or any other medication or herb to help relieve the sensation? Any information would be greatly appreciated.",3,0

I’ve been taking kratom for almost 2 years everyday. It worked great until it didn’t. Maybe some if you can relate. It’s like it turned on me- having so many benefits and being what I thought was a Godsend at first to making me feel like a slave to yet another substance. I felt like crap all the time in the last 6 months or so and would always wake up in wds. My last dose was about 11:30 a.m. yesterday 7/29 and almost 26 hrs later I have virtually no wds. This is why I’m freaking out but so thankful at the same time. The only thing different I did was I took OPMS gold capsules (3) for my last dose and I’ve never taken extracts before- only plain leaf.  Does anyone know if those have a longer half-life and that could be why I’m not experiencing wds or did I just get super fucking lucky.

Today I woke up just like the last two days, sweating, cold, achy. However, I am functioning. I think I assumed this withdrawl would be identical to the seriously intense opiate withdrawls that I have been through. By me thinking that, I think it made going through this withdrawl easier. I think mainly you have to be mentally strong to get through this. I am staying positive no matter what thoughts come to my mind. It is not easy, don’t get me wrong. Music has helped me so much... I have had headphones in all day everyday during this. I am no different than any of you. I have thoughts of kratom every two seconds it seems. However, that’s what this plant has done to me. I am fighting those thoughts with every piece of me. I think I am smoothly going through this. I have only taken clonidine on Day 1 CT. I don’t like medicine so I have tried not to take it. I have been taking gabapentin. Yes it is I guess helping a little, but the drunk feeling and tiredness you feel on it is making me want to stop taking it. It helped me in the past when I wasn’t withdrawling while taking it. For withdrawls I am the type of person that doesn’t like taking any medicine. This is the first time I have ever detoxed at home. I never had the strength. I am proud of myself and that is helping me. I am happy I don’t have to be locked up or in a detox withdrawaling. Listen, to anyone struggling going through a withdrawal right now, you CAN do it. It is hard, but keep thinking of why you are quitting. At least give yourself a CHANCE to feel freedom and life for what it is. What helped me have 4 years of sobriety before taking kratom is meditation, working out, eating healthy, and doing self care (doing things alone that made ME happy). I need to be myself again. I turned my back on thousands of people that look up to me. I have told my story to students from hundreds of schools and spoke in front of thousands of people at events. I have saved so many lives by helping others. I need to be that person again. I want money again. I want to keep my 4.0 in college without using kratom to give me a boost to study. Do this for you.

It's coming out as attacks on my partner and I believe a lot of it is cause by the confusion of getting sober after so long ,the anger of nicotine withdrawal and the general lack of feelings towards life.

I'm. Hitting. A. Super. Low. Point.

Today I was being a dick and I was angry that I'm so blank and I didn't want to deal with my kids and I just wanted to be left alone. This all culminated in my walking away from my family going to my old place of work and just getting facked up. It was actually pretty invigorating to feel ""normal"" and able to talk to people when I was drunk. Those feelings disappeared however by the time I left and I remember being semi blacked out and just feeling like shit. Like drunken stomach hurting dehydrated pain shit. Rode bus home. Was blacked out. Dont remember much after that. Hopefully I didn't act foolish b4 bed.

 I know that's not good to do and I had a terrible experience last time I drank at like day 8. 


It's all whatever. I let go and move back into this moment. Thanks for letting me go over that with yall. I'm still off kratom. I'm going to keep making a comeback. My only fear is falling back.

I was addicted for about 2 years and it’s the second time that I quit cold turkey. The last 4 months of my usage I was swallowing about 30 GPD and I felt like I was trapped in my own living hell. My health was getting worse and worse, I lost more weight than my body ever should, lost my hairs to the point that I shaved them and depression could’ve killed me. Deep inside I knew that I couldn’t lie to myself anymore and that this shit has to stop. April 14th was the day i threw away my K-bags and planned my quit. I bought some stuff like vitamin-c, magnesium, bath additives etc and called my doc in hope that I get something that helps like gabapentin etc. But he didn’t knew K and insulted me for being an addict and said that I have to go through that on my own. And so I did.

The first week was the worst. Absolutely all symptoms that are typical for the first week.
Around the 2nd week, everything started to get a little better. The physical symptoms subsided a lil bit but the mental got worse. My anxiety got unbearable sometimes and I was depressed, but glad that I already got through the worst.
Week 3 until now everything got better each week. There where bad weeks and god ones but it was clear to see that things were going uphill.
I’ve I can make it than all of you can! And I promise you that a life were you don’t have to swallow that green shit every 1-2 hours and go through constant WD’s is definitely better.

Work has been a stress fest and I feel like I don't really fit in with anyone there and my anxiety and nervousness is annoying to my coworkers.

I cant start a conversation to save my life, nor can I keep them going when they’re started by someone else, unless they’re meaningless and goofy. OCD about my mental state... meaning im obsessed with how “normal” im acting and or with whether or not I am neurotypical.

I try to challenge myself to wait an extra hour or so sometimes before the next dose, it can get annoying because after 2,5-3 hours after dosing I get this really bad back pain and restless legs etc.
I was about to go to sleep yesterday like 4 hours after dosing and it got quite bad, could not relax and lay still.. So I remembered I read (here on the wiki I believe) that the Wim Hof breathing method is effective. And since I am familiar with it (but haven't done it for a while) I decided to try it. 
It actually helped tremendously!! 

I am so happy I realised this, I think this will help me a lot going further with the tapering. 

I just wanted to share this, really recommend it if you are having a rough time. 
Peace :D",3,0

I was cold today and weak today, but I was able to get up and do everything I needed to around the house, but I needed short breaks for water, medicine, and to lay down. My mind definitely messed with me today. The kratom demon made me think to myself “why am I even quitting?” and “oh I can do a little bit.” However, I fought those thoughts and stayed strong. I have had headphones in listening to music all day. I am thinking about what I want to do when I have money. I want to finish school and deck out my new car. I want to save money and be able to buy everything I want. I want to be free. The mental anguish is definitely difficult to overcome. The phsyical aspect is not bad right now.

But that was during the PAWS in the beginning.  I only had the greens come back through one night which was that night. Along with the depression and anxiety, yesterday I was also sweating like a pig, that kind of stress sweat but just has a distinctive smell to it but I don't have that today either. It's mainly the depression and anxiety the have returned and I'm wondering if this is normal or If I caused it myself by resuming taking Benadryl on day 6 thru today.  I take Benadryl every day but the 1st 6 days of my detox I didn't take any because I read it can exacerbate it. I shouldn't be having too harsh or too long of a detox period bc  I wasn't a long time user. So I don't know if the 2 are related or if it is to be expected.

I quit kratom a little over a year ago by going on buprenorphine, I was taking somewhere between 50-100g of kratom a day and have been on 2-6mg of bupe during this time. I have had a couple of relapses but they were short for the most part. I recently had a dose change and ran into this issue with my insurance where they will only fill a portion of my prescription so currently am without bupe for 9 more days. Regardless of how you feel about buprenorphine for treating kratom addiction, please continue to read. I am not sharing this with you because I have a question but because I want to share with you how I am feeling right now at this moment. I have been off the meds for a couple of days and as you assume, it doesn't feel very good (physically) but there is an upside to this. I am a creative person who has always only been able to succeed in any activity that I had passion for and if I didn't, I couldn't give a fuck about it. During this kratom addiction and throught treating my addiction with bupe i lost all of my passion for life or anything really, and previously I was a very sexual person, and while being on this shit I have had pretty much no interest for sex. so now it been a couple of days I've been off my meds and I feel physically sick but psychologically I feel fucking amazing. I am listening to music and I feel every sound, also, my sexual desire is running rampant. I feel like my fucking self again and like I can fucking do whatever the fuck I put my mind to in this world.

- Day 1 to 3, not very sick.. but trouble at sleep..
- Day 4 to 7 , the worst part in my life.. like im living in hell
- Day 7 to 14, the worst is start to decrease day by day but the PAWS is coming i think.. but thankfully i manage to hold and this subreddit play major role to motivated me..
- Day 14 to 21, the sickness will fade away & by day 21, i think i dont have body pain anymore, just physcological pain.

Update :
- Day 34, finally feel 90% normal. 
- Day 81, PAWS start hitting back because of covid 19 lockdown. Luckily I can hold it.
- Day 142, my daughter was born (best day of my life because she is the main reason I quit kratom)
- Day 210, get my normal life back. Free from kratom. Never ever thought about kratom anymore. The only thing i concern about is my weight gained 10kg now, i need to start healthy diet & more exercise.

These are the reasons I use Kratom.  My Dr has prescribed SSRI’s in the past but I don’t like the sexual side effects as a male and Kratom certainly doesn’t help.  He recently prescribed a low dose of Effexor but that is also having unwanted side effects.  He said next in line to try is Buspar and I’ve been doing a bit of research on it and I read that it can help with heroin withdrawal.

I’m very interested in hearing advice, pointers, experiences from all of you in the quitting kratom community.

My dose was probably considered smallish at 4 grams 2 times per day (morning and late afternoon) of Red Borneo mostly. For two days I took only 3 grams, once a day, so although I would not consider that a taper I think it did cause me to have some symptoms of withdrawal from the sudden decrease prior to taking my last dose yesterday morning at 7:30.

I feel like shit right now, but it’s tolerable. Had to use xanax for sleep last night along with a weed gummy. I was varying between chills and profuse sweating during the night. So far today I have chills (no fever - I’m required to take my temp at the beginning of my shift).

I’m getting married in a week and a half and I NEED to feel better by then....before then actually. No matter how shitty I feel I still have a crap ton of responsibilities AND I’m working in an office setting throughout my withdrawal. Ugh. 

Any advice to speed up the WD process? I’m drinking lots of water and exercising already. I have too much on my plate to be dysfunctional!

40,2020-07-29 08:35:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hzzxga/day_1_not_dosing/,Day 1 not dosing,"Ive used kratom for over a year now. At one point using 10 gram doses 3-4 times a day, at another point dosing 4 grams every 4 hours.

The standard dose schedule of the precious two weeks before this one was about 25-30 grams per day, me doing multiple 4 gram doses and then up to 10 before bed. 

Yesterday, i dosed one gram in the morning, about 8:00 am, and went all day without many noticeable withdrawal besides hightened sensitivity to emotions until about 5:30pm when i dosed 2 grams that didnt even do much but make me feel guilty for caving.
I dosed again, this time 6 grams, at 8:30pm and decided when i went to bed id do better today.

This morning i currently have no extreme urge to re dose, i dont have the uncomfortability yet, though it doesnt mean it wont happen. Im really trying to quit this stuff. It was helpful for a time but now all its doing is keeping me from being honest and being my true self. Its a crutch and i dont wanna worry all the time about how long its been since ive dosed.

This stuff has given me dark circles under my eyes, and has made me all around unmotivated and lazy. Im tired of being dependent on green sand that only makes me feel good for like an hour and then at baseline for another 6. Im ready to move on from kratom and be 100% sober. 

Started morning with prayer/meditation (im spiritual but not religious) and am hoping for the best. Have the day off and hope the withdrawals arent as terrible as i read on here. Not opposed to taking another taper dose to fend off withdrawals, but dont feel i need one now, and wont cave unless im just in total agony.",6,0

Okay, my life is falling apart. Kratom amplifies my depression 10 fold, my anxiety is worse too. 

Quick background: quit Kratom at the end of 2015. I was on it for 5 years and was taking nearly two oz’s day. I’ve been through it, I’ve been through that hell and I know exactly how it is. It took me nearly a year to get back to place of normality. 

In 2017 I got back on it. I was suffering severe anxiety and even though I swore I’d die before I went through that hell again, I still got back on it. I had this idea that antidepressants were the devil but God do I wish I would have just gone that route. I feel like a failure. 

So it’s been 3 years and I use two oz’s daily. I have to quit again but I can’t do what I did last time even with a taper. I guess I’m too mentally weak but I can’t do it again without help. I think my brain just doesn’t make the right chemicals because I get incredibly, incredibly low. It’s suffering and I suffer a lot mentally as it is. 

I just recently started an SNRI called Pristiq. Last summer I tried 2 different SSRI’s, including Wellbutrin and I had horrible side effects. Took a gene test and found out I don’t metabolize any of them properly, this current one is supposed to at least metabolize properly. 

Anyway, I don’t know why I go on so long in my posts as I’m sure no one really cares, so, to get down to it, has anyone had success using an SSRI/SNRI to quit Kratom? I would really, really love to hear your experiences if so. My hope is that it could curb a lot of the severe depression and anxiety as well as lead to a quicker recovery time. It’s PAWS that destroyed me for about a year.

I'm mostly lurking around in this subreddit, and reading your posts and comments makes me so happy because it reminds me that we're all humans and we care about each other. So I've decided to get a little scaler and start a very slow taper - between 0.8% to 1.2% every 3 weeks.

Cutting to the chase: this very helpful comment I found on a YouTube video section gave me so much insight into the difference between the two methods, and while tapering can be an extremely effective method, you must be very careful on how to do it. Although the subject was addicted to opioids (it seems multiple of 'em). I think his insight is great, so I thought some of us would appreciate it. Here it is:  


>My experience as an addict for 20 years... and kicking 50 different times...  Sir, you did it the worst way, because you tried to wean down. You're better off just quitting cold turkey. From just OxyCodone, you would have been on the UP swing by day 5 or 6. By 'weaning', you were constantly giving your body just enough opioids to constantly restart the withdrawal process, but not enough to get accustomed to a dose. In other words, either kick, cold turkey, with nothing, or wean down, much more slowly with diminishing doses in smaller steps.  But had you just went cold turkey on day 1, by day 6 and 7, you begin feeling better. You're screwed for about 2 weeks, but the week isn't nearly as bad as the first. And it may take months for everything to be perfect, like a person that was never physically dependent, but 95% of the withdrawal misery is gone after just 2 weeks. Or... Just wean more slowly so you have a chance to adapt to each new lower dose. And then stay on each lowered dose for a longer period, to get that as your new norm... And repeat.   Either way, though, for me, cold turkey is always the easiest. Tapering is impossible. It's like tapering with cigarettes. For me I want at least a pack a day, or none at all. The 'little crumbs' is more frustrating and painful than just getting past withdrawals as fast as humanly possible. Jail works to finally give people clean time for the first time. Because the reason kicking is so hard is because we know we can always cave in under the misery. Willpower. It's really a doozy when you know your dealer is there for you. Jail, though, willpower plays no role. You know the cops won't give you squat. So your brain just accepts that, and there isn't that mental torture of having to be your own gate-keeper, so to speak.   Weaning too fast makes withdrawals worse by just stretching the days out needlessly. The small bits of opioids you take just restart the entire withdrawals. You don't want to have anything touching those mu-opioid-receptors, that way, the healing can finally begin. It's the only way. I wish there was a short-cut. We all do. It doesn't exist yet.    Fun fact: Adrenaline plays a vital role in withdrawals being easier. One weird perk of jail withdrawing is you're constantly on guard from the other people there... so the whole experience keeps your body on a low-dose adrenaline drip which helps. I can prove adrenaline works wonders, depending on how much is excreted by your body. When a dope fiend is withdrawing... nothing can get him out of bed, just moaning and feeling like death. But if he suddenly knows where he left a pill, or bag of dope, etc, he suddenly has all the energy and happiness in the world and pops out of bed like a flower and runs to take that sweet relief. Sure, it sets back withdrawals. Of course. But the addict will have this energy boost and happiness before he even takes the pill. Because knowing he's got relief now releases adrenaline and happiness on its own.",3,0

When I was out of bed I felt kinda better than laying in bed. I was tired today though I didn’t get much sleep, but this was due to me staying up watching movies.

Today my mind was playing games all day, but I stayed strong! I think the hardest part for me was I was not use to eating mid day. My addiction was so severe that I waited until midnight to eat. I starved all day, so that ALL of my kratom was on an empty stomach. It feels truly weird to not dose each hour. I remember how life was before taking kratom though, and it was the happiest time in my life. I am tired of not wanting to eat early breakfasts with my family, I never want to go to lunch or dinner because it messes with my kratom doses. I hate myself for when my parents make dinner and I run upstairs with my food and actually eat it later.

Quick background: 28M, addicted to opiates since 19. Used pills and dope for the first few years. Got on suboxone at 22. Took the subs daily for way too long, up until 11/18 when I switched to Kratom. The abrupt transition from subs to Kratom was rough at first, but soon I was feeling the best I had in years.

25gpd of Kratom was a wonder drug at first. Once the Subs were completely out of my system, I was able to fully embrace what Kratom had to offer. I felt motivated, calm, peaceful, and I was way more present in life. I went back to school, got good grades and got accepted into a nursing program.

But just like every chemical crutch I have leaned on over the years, the Kratom has started to turn on me. I am so emotionally flat all the time. No ups or downs, just numbness. I feel HORRENDOUS every morning, like I've been run over by a truck. I look terrible. My eyes have no life in them and my skin is gaunt. I have no social life.

I used it to get off of opiates a couple years ago,  used  gabapentin to get off the kratom. Anyways,  I have been feeling mentally exausted and just wanted to change the way I felt.  And just have a break from feeling shitty.  I have leukemia and take targeted chemo medication daily so I don't feel well. On top of being chemically imbalanced after years of off and on opiate use. So my baseline is basically feeling shitty.  

I used kratom for 3 days,  and knew I was in trouble. The first and second day were great. Very productive and felt great, motivated etc. Day 3 I fell into the same old kratom lethargy, unmotivated, irritable etc. I woke up the next morning feeling awful.   Restless legs,  watery eyes, diarrhea and anxiety already. I had stuff to do that day, and so I went and got more kratom.  3 days worth more. I knew what I was setting myself up for before I did it.  But I still did it. That's addiction.  

I took kratom the next 3 days and was pretty much non productive. Ignoring texts, couldn't even play video games. Training my dog was a burden.  I woke up on day 7 after taking kratom for 6 days and knew I was screwed.  I looked at my pup and told her I know I have to do better and I'll do it for her. I have a working lines malinois that needs a ton of work and interaction. She's a very serious dog, not a pet. She needs a job constantly. And when I was on kratom I basically had her kenneled or on a placemat because I didn't have the drive to work with her. And that's what I do for a living,  I train doggos.  

I didn't sleep well for 2 nights,  had all the withdrawal symptoms, maybe not as severe but they were there.  It's been 5 days now and I'm feeling better.

I was only using for 3 weeks but I still went through hell. The first 4-5 days were a personal hell, the likes of which I never want to go through again. The physical was hard, but the mental anguish was torture.

To get through each day, I forced myself out first thing to go for a walk while listening to classical piano music. I ate healthily, drank tons of relaxing herbal tea (Starbucks Peach Tranquility), and went on long drives to pass the time. I also sought medical help on Day 1 from a local clinic that specializes in withdrawal and they had helped people go through kratom withdrawal before. They gave me some meds to help.

I remember it being around Day 9 where the clouds started to part for me and I started to see more hope. By this time, the majority of my symptoms were mental. Anxiety, depression, feelings of restlessness and impending doom feelings.

Day 16 and 17 I had some bad anxiety. Here was where I made a big change: I actively forced myself to start saying positive mantras and stopped googling symptoms and reading this sub. This was a game changer for me. I started saying only positive things when people asked me how I was doing. This was key. The more you say ""oh I still have anxiety"" or explain your WDs, the more that will become your reality. The more you speak positively and believe you are better, the more THAT becomes your reality.

I've had some ups and downs since then, but today is Day 26 and I am feeling lightyears better. Still a little off, but I chalk that up to a new ADHD med that the doctor put me on which was what I was trying to do with kratom in the first place!",6,0

I did the math and it makes it about 11-20 gpd maybe more on other days.  

First off I just got out of a 9 year relationship and felt terrible the first few weeks of July and started having massive fatigue and diarrhea everyday.  I believe my gut was just destroyed between all the years of kratom abuse, mass stress from the breakup, and the withdrawals starting to kick in.  On the 10th I started marking the calendar to make it official and have been taking minuscule amounts up until tonight.  I probably took less than a gram as my only dose today so I hope it’s been long enough to avoid some of the more serious withdrawals.  

I think I’ve already gone through some of the withdrawals just going from 11-20 gpd to 1-2gpd in a short period of time.  It’s time to do it for real now.  Having the tiny little amounts was tremendously helpful and even though I haven’t acclimated 100% to them I think I could get through the next week of physical pain without dosing.

I was surprised how few symptoms I had on day 1, then things got a little worse on day 2 and again on day 3. Today, Day 4, the symptoms are much worse. I’m having trouble working and am pretty uncomfortable. Is today likely to be the peak of the withdrawal, or will this go on for another couple of days before it begins to ramp down? 

I quit CT a few years back and that withdrawal was a lot worse than this taper. But today’s symptoms seem about as bad as when I quit CT. Man, do I wish I’d stayed off of this stuff when I kicked last time.

In order to quit I replaced my morning and afternoon dosing with taking a couple hits of pre-rolled joints of 17% CBD 0.6% THC. I've kept my evening dose of kratom to slowly taper off so I don't have to deal with the withdrawals.

It literally gets rid of my cravings for kratom while I'm using CBD that has tiny amounts of THC in it.  I can also stay productive while working from home (work as a programmer).

 I tried pure CBD products, but it doesn't really do anything for me in terms of reducing cravings. So I think that the THC is sort of necessary.

Are blood tests reliable indicators of chronic exposure to lead?,"TL;DR anyone ever have a urine/hair test done for heavy metals? I read that blood tests aren’t accurate unless they’re checking for acute exposure to heavy metals (ie large amounts of lead at one time, rather than smaller amounts of lead over a long period).


Just wondering. I saw some posts where people tested their kratom or had it tested by a lab (with mixed results) but usually people can poke holes in the methodology or the credibility of the testing facility.

Or at least they did in the one or two posts I saw. Other sites that sell kratom claim to test their stuff but people pointed out that a vendor could just show you results from any batch or just fabricate results. There are a lot of places that say they are GMP compliant but they aren’t listed on the AKA website. 

So I guess the easiest way is to get your doctor to test you, rather than fiddling around with expensive and/or unreliable kratom testing labs. Now I’ve seen people say that they’ve had blood panels done and they didn’t have any indications of lead poisoning, but I’ve also read that you would only see a significant amount of lead in your blood if you had acute poisoning. Lead collects in other areas of the body: urine and hair tests seem more reliable indicators of consistent, chronic exposure to lead - smaller (but still unhealthy) doses of lead in kratom, all building up in tissue and bone and wherever else. So unless you were eating giant amounts of kratom in a single dose you likely wouldn’t see anything in your blood.

I hate to beat a dead horse with this heavy metals thing. The FDA study that came out over a year ago has been shown to be purposefully misleading. Though some of the numbers on there are worrisome, the vast majority were at around safe levels. However, the more I read about the conditions of certain growers in Indonesia or wherever, the more concerned I get about not just lead but other contaminants. 

I’m just curious if anyone actually got a urine/hair test and whether or not they were diagnosed with heavy metal toxicity.

I’m just paranoid about this stuff and the anxiety from withdrawing doesn’t help. I’m in the process of quitting after using for a very long time. I’m getting all kinds of side effects, some of which I can recognize as plain old withdrawal symptoms. Others are more concerning and aren’t like anything I’ve ever experienced before. I had a blood test done for lead poisoning but they didn’t find any lead. I am getting a lot of bizarre symptoms that I can’t explain. I’ve gone through withdrawals many times (hoping this is the last) so I’m familiar with what withdrawal usually looks like.  

Also please correct me if I misinterpreted the science behind lead in blood. It’s just my understanding that lead doesn’t collect in the blood, and would only be present there if you were exposed to a lot of it all at once.

For context, I never even intended to go into withdrawal. I made an error. I ran out of Kratom on a Saturday and I couldn’t order it until Monday and for it to arrive on Tuesday. I was already having insomnia with the Kratom, but I thought maybe the Kratom stimulated me since it was white Kratom. This error almost cost me my life. The most insane fucking thing to me is that, I quit cold turkey in the past with absolute ease even though I was completely reliant on it! I used to use Kratom with Coffee and Venlafaxine and that was a magical combination until I realised if you get too cocky and only play GTA 5 the whole time... you’re gonna need more and more to be satisfied with life. I can’t afford that and it also would’ve made it harder to quit. Also I had stopped methylphenidate around a month or so before this, and was waiting for an appointment to switch to dexamphetamine. But like I said, I didn’t even fucking think twice, I just stopped Kratom and I literally felt nothing. Been on it for only around an extra month, no dosage increase, the only thing I can think of that has been such a significant difference is that either adderall is built up in my system, or the insomnia has amplified the symptoms, or the Kratom I took (which felt very very strong) genuinely only needed to be taken for a couple months not even beyond 5g a day (I think it’s <5 grams? I took it in capsules).

I am prescribed adderall for my ADHD, and prescribed Venlafaxine/Effexor for my Major Depressive Disorder. I also have Borderline Personality disorder. If you understand any of the medications/disorders/what I just said, you’re probably anticipating absolute hell. 

I’ve slept for 3 hours each night. First day and night was hell. But today... I woke up and whether it’s just impulsivity from ADHD and BPD, adderall withdrawal (I tried taking some but it made it worse) or even Venlafaxine adding noradrenaline... I felt like everything had just died, including me. I have never felt so low in my life. I haven’t cried in a long time but I can’t stop. And I really, really couldn’t escape it. My temperature regulation is non existent, parts of my body could cook some food they’re so hot and the other parts could freeze the food they’re so cold. When I press them together I’m surprised I don’t see smoke.

But. I found this sub and even though I’ve ordered Kratom, I don’t want to keep buying it anymore. It costs so much for me and I see other stories about the other side... it just keeps me going I guess. Like, I’m no longer actively looking to end the pain. I’m just laying here. Waiting. Everything is still horrific. For some reason I smell horrible even after showers.

So yeah. Anyone... got any advice? I don’t know if Venlafaxine is making this worse or better either. It’s an SNRI. Thanks if anyone reads this. I’m so scared. I don’t know what I’m doing or what’s happening but I’ve got people here who have done it themselves. Who knows.",7,0

We have a 1 year old and both work from home, so it can get pretty tense at times.  When it does get tense I think of all of the times kratom helped and hurt those situations.  Like it could (falsely) help by numbing them away, but also hurt by me getting even more pissed off that her bad mood was ruining my buzz.  I now feel more present and able to handle the situation like a loving husband and father, instead of an addict. 

I have also been religiously exercising.  Tennis 3x/ week and bodyweight workouts 3x/ week.  It was complete hell at first, but exercise and eating cleanly has **slowly** become my new obsession.  I bolded slowly because I feel like people just starting out read all of the posts about how amazing exercise is for us that are at least a few weeks clean.  Then they go try to run and can't make it 5 minutes.  If you commit to living a healthy life, it will slowly get easier.  It's hard to notice from a day-to-day perspective, but looking back at just a few weeks ago, I know I've improved my strength and endurance, and it feels great!  And I know there is so much more room for improvement. 

TL;DR don't get caught up in the day-to-day, or comparing your insides to other people's outsides.  Commit to living a healthy lifestyle and before you know it, you will feel better than you have in years.",20,0

Should I just stop taking it? I think the anxiety over potential dependence is just as much of a problem as the actual physical dependence.

91,2020-07-26 12:51:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hya84z/update_quitting_extracts/,"update, quitting extracts","Posted about a week or two ago about having binged extracts for a week after using once to twice a week for a few months or so, and having trouble with the withdrawal despite symptoms not being so bad.   


My issue was, I would make it 4-5 days without taking any and then break down from not being able to sleep, taking some, and then being pissed at myself and miserable for the next 5 days. I mentioned that every time I did this seemed to restart the symptoms. I have good news in regard to that.   


The symptoms were improving each time I did this. Not in terms of intensity (it felt just as shitty each time) but the duration until symptoms improved got shorter each time. I wish I could say I hadn't taken more after my initial post, but it's not true. I made it another 4 days and took an extract, and the continuation of the withdrawal lasted 3 days. I made it another 3 days and took another shot. The duration of withdrawal lasted 2 days. Made it another 2 days beyond that with no symptoms, took an extract, woke up and felt extremely mild withdrawal symptoms that dissipated in around 3-5 hours.   


I've lost track of how many days it's been since I last took it, I think somewhere around 5. I feel fine. No physical symptoms at all. Only ongoing issues are diarrhea, which always lasts longer than the withdrawal itself for me, and some difficulty sleeping. I have clonidine for that, and beyond that I don't feel as compelled to go get more around the 5 day mark anymore.   


I guess I accidentally did a weird kind of taper. It seems to have worked, for now. Figured i'd update in case anyone finds this to be useful knowledge.   


P.S, for information's sake, I know I can't say the brand here, but lets just say I was using the -strongest- extract out there, and I was doing only one shot or capsule each time I slipped up, with a minimum of 4 days inbetween doses. The first 3 four-five day periods I didn't see any improvement and thought I was prolonging my withdrawal. By the 4th period I started feeling better by day 2, and by day 3 was out of withdrawal. I used again one time after that and was in withdrawal the next day for around 6 hours before abruptly returning to baseline. Sleep issues and diarrhea persist right now but I feel fine mentally and physically. Am taking clonidine for sleep (only when I feel I really need it). This might be a viable taper method if you can make it 4 days and control your dosage. if you have issues with self control I wouldn't recommend it though. Thanks for your support guys, hopefully I stay clean this time. Too early to know yet but I'm feeling good and motivated. Work has been going well since I went back last monday.",2,0

(If you want to hear a horror story ask me about how my psychiatrist didn’t know naltrexone would interact with kratom when I had just bought a fucking kilo and was swimming in green powder)

Background (not important but whatever, skip if you feel like it!) I’ve been in and out of therapy and psychiatrists offices since I was like 11. I’ve been diagnosed with probably everything in the DSM. I went through a “fuck this” phase in my early 20s, stopped all meds and therapy and immediately started drinking like a fish. That led to a lot of bad decisions (surprise surprise) which led back to therapy which lead back to seeing a psychiatrist. That was 5 years ago, right around the time I started using kratom. I’m 32 now and have finally realized I have the agency to “fire” a therapist or psych that’s not helping, so I FINALLY found one of each and things are going SO MUCH BETTER. But, I’ve been taking kratom the whole time.

THE PRESSING QUESTION/ISSUE/WHATEVER
I am in 4 antidepressants, on anti anxiety, and Adderall. I, surprisingly to myself, don’t about my meds (it’s some kind of miracle). I’m worried that stopping kratom is going to alter the way they work though. Also, 4 antidepressants is insane (total of like 500mg all together). I’ve read that kratom could have an antidepressant effect, which would mean this could go very wrong. But, I wonder if getting the kratom out of my system will help the meds function more effectively in my brain. 

Have any of y’all been on antidepressants or other psych meds while in active addition that weren’t specifically because of kratom use? Thanks!",3,0

Maybe it’s not even allowed, idk. I haven’t read the rules for this page in quite some time. My daily Kratom usage has skyrocketed SIGNIFICANTLY since the lockdowns started in the US a few months ago. I’m ordering kilos every 2/3 weeks. I don’t even know how much I’m using daily, but it’s a lot. I’m at the point where I prepare a shake (I mix my Kratom with protein powder in a blender bottle) and leave it on my nightstand every night with a bottle of water, so that I can dose immediately after waking up. I have probably between 6-8 shakes per day. 

I know I need to stop but I don’t know what the final straw will be. I was in recovery from drugs and alcohol before I started using Kratom (2.5 years sober) so I’m not unfamiliar with addiction. I’ve been to rehab once and I REALLLLLY don’t want to go to rehab for fucking Kratom. 

I’m also experiencing a new possible side effect which is chest pain. Not even sure if it’s definitely related to my Kratom use but from what I’ve read on some of these Kratom subs is that this is not uncommon. They’re relatively mild chest pains that are best described as shooting pains. I know I should go to the doctor or hospital but my irrational fear is that I’ll be stuck in the hospital without Kratom and I’ll go into withdrawals. 

I’m not sure why I’m posting here. Maybe for some motivation. I’m really not looking to be belittled or barked at, so please don’t come at me with anything smart or cocky. I know I’m an addict, I know I need to stop, and I know I’m being a fucking idiot. You don’t need to tell me this. I know I need help. Maybe I just had to get this off my chest (no pun intended).

I get that it's just a plant and my relationship with it is a problem. Some things are a non issue for me, kratom isn't one of those things.

I have legitimate pain issues that I originally started pain pills many years ago for. I got off those and found kratom. It was a godsend for pain relief and didnt put me in a nodding stupor. Its super functional. 

Obviously over time the good decreases and bad get worse. The irratiabiltiy, sleeplessness, and general lack of dopamine me the most. It's like all the color of the world is gone. Everything is monochromatic and grey. I feel a shell of a person.

I know I'm past the worst but I still feel like shit. Weed helps a bit. Staying busy helps more. Walked 5 hours today in the woods. As soon as I stop my mind murders me. My skin scrawls. I'm so tired.    So fucking tired. 

I'm so close I can taste it, but at my core I know how addictive and obsessive I can be. I put down the booze 9 months ago. I have to slay this kratom beast now. Quit vaping the juul around 35 days ago.

I will quit weed last. I'm down to my last 7g. I don't have anyone I can really talk to. My wife is understanding and patient but doesnt know what it's like to be addicted or deal with withdrawals.

So many of my friends who frequent the kratom bars really belive it's a harmless tea. One of my buddies is convinced he isn't addicted, but has been taking 6g per day for a while. He used to drink 10 to 20g drinks. Now he says 6g a day is fine. I bet dollars to donuts you stop taking kratom your gonna start feeling shitty.

Even when I got down to 6g per day on my taper vs nothing was night and day. Even taking a gram was enough to stave of feeling shitty for a couple hours.

I mean I still have my best friend, but besides him I have no one. Kratom completly killed my sex drive, which means I never actually had a girlfriend. It made me lazy, which means I didnt do anything with my life, I just was in my room all day. I just played videogames all day alone or sometimes with my sister and watched history documentaries all day. Mostly about the second world war and other historic topics. Instead of building a own life, get into relationships, I just was on kratom in my room all day.

Yes kratom helped me immensely to get off weed and party drugs like meth/speed and mdma, but in the end it made me content with doing nothing.  I currently feel like I wasted my youth and I dont know how to handle that feeling :( I mean I am introverted naturally, but kratom made me 100x times more introverted.

I just moved into a new place in a new city. Since I’ve been down here, I have been successfully tapering rapidly with almost no desire to increase doses (tapered from about 15gpd to 6gpd just this week). Until recently, my dad knew that I was taking kratom but my mom didn’t know, and I told my dad in no uncertain terms not to tell my mom. Both of my parents seem to think that kratom is just as dangerous as heroin, and while there are certainly major negatives to taking kratom, I think we can all agree that it’s not heroin. I have quit previously in the past (I only started up again because I was bored during the pandemic. I know, bad idea) and the way I did this was by telling absolutely nobody about it. This way, I didn’t feel pressured to taper down faster than I was ready for, I wasn’t stressed out by other people bugging me about whether or not I had quit yet, and I could feel like I was genuinely quitting because I wanted to, not because somebody else wanted to.

Well today I was talking on the phone with my mom and at the end of the call she added, “By the way, we’re going to have to talk about the fact that you’re back on kratom. Your dad told me.” I’m pretty mad that my dad had betrayed my trust like that. Like I said, the most success I’ve had with quitting kratom has been when nobody is bugging me about it and I feel like I’m quitting only for myself. I’ve since tried telling my parents this but now they both think that I’m lying to them about how much I’ve tapered because “that’s what heroin addicts do”. What am I supposed to do in this situation? Maybe I’m making excuses, but I know myself and honestly the more they keep bugging me about this, the more it will stress me out and the more likely I will be to say “fuck it” and increase my doses and come up with some bullshit reason of why I don’t need to quit right now. I’ve tried telling them this before and they just tell me I’m “blaming them for my addiction”, which would be valid if not for the fact that literally the only time I’ve been successful quitting was when nobody was fucking nagging me about it, and, like I said at the beginning, I’ve been extremely successful with tapering since I moved to my new place. This is the fastest I’ve ever successfully tapered and now I feel like all my progress is in jeopardy because no matter how fast I taper, nothing will be fast enough for my parents.

I’m not normally one to share, but I’ve gotten to a point in my life where I know I need to change. I’ve been using kratom for over three years every day. Around 30g a day (10grams 3x daily)... it has been huge for improving my mood overall and helping in some pain relief. I also know that it has control over my mind and my schedule. The cons are outweighing the pros for me at this point.

I’ve never spoken to anyone about my usage, I even have a family and kids. They have no idea. I’ve gotten to the point where I am ready to quit, but I need help. I’ve tried and have not succeeded. For me the restless legs/agitation is so unbearable and I know that’s not even the worst part. But for me if I even skip a dosage during the day I start to get restless legs and agitation. At night I have to extra dose so that I don’t start having restless legs and restlessness at three in the morning. 

Just looking for some who have been on this journey to point me in the right direction, supplements I can take to ease the symptoms, I have looked at tapering plans. I just need someone to help point me in the right direction as I’m scared at this point to make the jump.

Thanks in advance.",6,0

I figured I'd want to share with you my experience (3.5 years daily use but with T breaks every 2-3 months). I decided to take this long break because I had ramped up my dosage of 10 grams to 25grams in the past 4 months of lockdown here. 

I know this isn't the usual post about WD symptoms or progress. After the first few days of general uncomfort. This day I really felt my emotions come back from the green fog. Lots of posts here celebrate when the emotions come back but it's so difficult when the entire situation is difficult.

So here goes : 

Am a decently paid corporate slave that lives in the Philippines which is honestly one of the worst shitholes thanks to our murderous dictator who makes Trump/ Bolsonaro and the like seem as if they were the best presidents ever. 

I absolutely love the environment and our forests here but it really is hopeless. I've tried to help protect our forests/wetlands with a local group but it's really an uphill battle. Seeing the forests get smaller and smaller each time I visit them has really taken a toll on me. This past day I've been having an internal crisis that I'm not doing enough to help.

 I'm always constantly kicking myself that I sold my soul to a corporation instead of being a biologist/environmental activist (which I didnt pursue because 1. In this shithole, our activists are labeled by the govt as terrorists , 2. You cannot make a living wage as one)  Honestly, as strongly as I feel about nature, I do not want to get killed or put my family at risk for this. 

 I've realized everything that I believe in is a losing battle. I've known this for a long-time but 9 days away from the kratom it really hit me and this feels absolutely shitty. 

I've always read the advice here that instead of masking your problems with kratom you should work on them internally. But how do I even work on things  I have absolutely no control over. I've realized my dosage kicked up significantly to mask the pain from all the frustration of living in one of the worst countries in the world. 

I'm sorry this doesn't end with any hopeful note.",8,3

You'll be 100% after a month (this is from my experience).

Two weeks ago, I have also quit Remeron because I was uncontrollably gaining weight. In one year, I went from 165lbs to 235lbs and my appetite was horribly affected. The WD's that I am suffering right now are much worse than that of Kratom. Although I have been tapering several months (30mg to 3mg), the WD's are just horrible. In the first week, I've felt nothing at all. Starting at day 10, I began having really bad headaches. In day 14, I was feeling really sick. I was vomiting, coughing and really dizzy that lasted for a few more days. Finally, I am starting to feel better.

  It’s early morning and I just watched the sun rise from my back yard.  I’ve been up since 3:00am because of insomnia from wd’s but I’m not complaining.  

I took my last dose Sunday and to say this week has been rough would be an incredible understatement. 
 
The first 3 days were brutal but it did subside around the 4th.  
 I honestly believe God/Universe/angels helped me. 
But I had to completely surrender and decide I couldn’t do this any longer.   I had been wanting to quite for over two years.  

The psychological withdrawals have been a complete mind fuck.  I’ve cleaned up from a bad oxy habit some years ago and it wasn’t nearly as difficult as the mental anguish I’ve experienced going through this process. 

For those of you that are contemplating quitting or are in the middle of it, you have all of my support and love.  

The first few days broke me... bad.   
 I say this not to scare people but to warn them, especially if they have underlying issues with depression and suicidal thoughts.  
 If you are contemplating jumping off from a dose similar to mine, and do have these issues, please consider going through a detox under professional care, if possible.   I WOULD NOT recommend jumping from this dosage if you can’t dedicate at least 5 days, minimum! 
  
It’s day 6 and my mind is beyond cloudy. I feel as though my IQ has been cut in half at this point, and from what I’ve learned, it happens to many people.  So be aware of that as well. 
  No major life decisions within the first week. Lol.  

I hope this makes sense.  I literally feel like I’m walking on Mars.  But the bottom line is it does get better. I promise. 

A few recommendations if going CT from a high dose....

- drink as much water as you can, and then drink more. 

- cut off from the world. Nothing else matters right now. This is the most important matter in your life at this moment.  

- have all the supplies you’ll need before WD’s begin. 

-find support and inspiration here. I sure did. The people in this community helped me more than I could have ever imagined. 

-if it’s safe for you to do so, try supplementing 5HTP.  I think it’s helping with the depression. But only if you’re not on medication that could react badly with it. (SSRI’s). 

- Cannabis helps tremendously.  If you’re not accustomed to it, take it slow and see how it effects you... Indica dominant would be my suggestion for the first week. 

- really prepare yourself mentally, it’s going to be one of the greatest challenges of your life but it’s necessary.  I’m already getting moments of clarity and real emotion and believe me,it feels so much better than the fake happiness of Kratom. 

If anyone needs to vent or wants someone to lean on while they take this journey, please feel free to DM me.  That’s how this works,  a continuous passing of love and compassion from one soul to the next.  

Love and blessings for all. 🙏🏽❤️",35,0
117,2020-07-25 00:06:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hxgf6c/quitting_both_phenibut_and_kratom_in_wd_and_have/,"Quitting both Phenibut and Kratom, in WD and have some questions (Lyrica use included)","Okay so, I originally made this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hte0nr/kratom\_to\_suboxone\_hairloss/](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hte0nr/kratom_to_suboxone_hairloss/)  on this subreddit, but I'm going to post this one on both of the quitting subreddits, as I am getting off both back to back pretty much and would appreciate any insight from either of the two.

For starters, I decided to stay away from the suboxone and am just going to go through the Kratom WD's and deal with whatever comes after. Okay anyway, I first started taking some phenibut a little over a year ago and used to only use it 1-2 times a week with exception a few instances of 3-4 days of use in a row, hitting a rebound or two. Started taking it daily about 5 months ago dosing from 2.5-5 grams per day over time (mostly at 3-3.5 grams). Was stupid and decided to try to using it to help me taper off kratom which ended up not working out after suffering a bad head injury (very concussed, memory issues, needed lots of dental work $$$) and coping with some worsening back pain and life in general. From there, both addictions grew bigger. And now it's been 14 days since I last took any phenibut, and got through the WD's with the help of pregabalin, and some low dose diazepam as well as some other supplements/etc. I'm prescribed both for legitimate reasons and don't want to mess around with them too much. Initially, I was prescribed pregabalin at 100 mg 1-2x per day during the phenibut withdrawals and was using around 200-300 mg during the worst of things to help ease the WD's. Before, I used to be able to go without the pregabalin without any issues other than dealing with some nerve pain, but lately, I've felt more of an impulse to take more of it since quitting the phenibut and currently in dealing with the kratom WD's I'm now in. I can't tell if it's just a craving for something to replace my addiction, or if I am beginning to develop a dependency already. I just got a new prescription of or 150 mg 1-2x per day when I already had a good amount of the 100's left, so have had quite a bit on hand. My tolerance seems to now be around 200-250 mgs to get the same effects that 100 mg used to do for me. Not as worried about the diazepam because I'm only taking 2-3.5 mgs at a time, breaking the 2 mg tabs in halves and quarters to try and use as sparingly as possible so that I don't blow through them and fuck myself over if I get hit with some serious anxiety in the near future.

Okay so that's the phenibut stuff, now onto kratom. Been a daily user of kratom for about a year to year and a half. Started using it 2-2.5 years ago beginning at 1-3 nights a week, then nightly, then eventually started dosing throughout the day. Was at 6-8 grams 4-5 times a day for the most part, but was dosing up to 10 grams at times during the end of my use (used pretty heavily during the phenibut WD's). I started a fast taper about 8 days after quitting phenibut. Got some quality kratom and realized part of the reason I was using so much was likely because I was ordering some real cheap shit online in bulk. I began experiencing hairloss once I started ordering the cheaper shit and using throughout the day. Makes me wonder if perhaps I was taking some real bunk shit cut with who knows what that may actually be the culprit of the hairloss, or at least a big contributer to it. It became easier for me to use less during a quick taper using the quality stuff I bought. Dropped about a gram a day and made the jump about 3 days ago at 5 grams 3-4 times a day. Been a bit rough, but I'm getting through it. But once again, I feel I may be using the pregabalin as a crutch dosing at 300-350 mgs 1-2 times per day and used 400 mgs once last night. I'm really trying to not go over 400, but perhaps I'm already substituting higher pregabalin use to take the place of these two addictions. I've tried seeing how I feel without it, and feel noticeably better after taking it, but it's hard to tell in Kratom WD and not too far out from dropping phenibut what exactly is making me feel whatever I'm feeling. Idk, I really do need the pregabalin for my nerve pain, so if I am trading one for two by bumping up the use a of something I actually need, maybe that's not actually the worst thing. But of course, I don't want to be dependent on anything if I can avoid it, especially with what I've heard of pregabalin withdrawals. At least I'm not going on the suboxone anymore and getting away from two addictions here.

So I suppose I'm mainly wondering about the pregabalin with where my usage is currently at and if anyone with more experience or knowledge of these things can offer me any insight? Will taking a daily low dose of pregabalin as prescribed help with PAWS from either phenibut or kratom? Could I perhaps take a very low dose of the phenibut for literally just a day rn with where I'm at to break things up a bit and help avoid dependency? Or could that send me back into withdrawal? I know it sounds like a pretty risky and potentially bad idea, but honest insight would be much appreciated as I'm not the most knowledgeable on these things. And honestly, will I ever be able to use either of these two responsibly again if I keep it to just one day of use here and there? Both have really helped me before when I was using responsibly at first, and I have beat my depression and am really overcoming a lot of the things I was using them to self-medicate for during daily use. Any links to other posts going over any of this stuff would be appreciated as well. I'm new to reddit and still figuring it out a bit.

More less important details:

In the other post, I was only talking about some of my trauma/issues/etc to explain that I'm not just some dumb kid chasing highs for kicks. I just wanted to provide some background to talk about things a bit and explain that I've really been self-medicating over the past few years and trying to escape things I've had trouble facing/dealing with. But lately, I've been much happier with myself and have grown a lot and become more of a fully-integrated, whole person (with the help of therapy and working a lot on myself). So I don't feel as much of a need to escape, and am much more accepting of things as they are. I've been learning some lessons, and don't want to trick myself into addiction again in the future, but I'm an open minded person and don't want to condemn all things like this because I know it's about how you use it. Since stopping the the phenibut and kratom, I've felt more of an impulse drink, eat junk food, and some stuff like that. And I have drank a little, but I've been eating good still, also using kava, cbd, and some other stuff. Used to get pretty drunk on weekends when I was younger, but have been drinking less frequently/more responsibly for awhile now and trying to watch it. On the flip side, I've also felt an impulse to replace these habits with healthier things like exercise (which I've been at for a little), skating again, writing, music, etc creative stuff, reconnecting with friends, and other good stuff like that. Any opinions on supplements to help me going forward or links to posts about that stuff would also be helpful and much appreciated. I'm feeling that magnesium, kava, cbd, and rhodilia have really been helping me and just picked up 5-HTP which seems to be doing something for sure. Less sure about L-theanine and ashwaganda, but I think they're helping a bit. Bottom line, I'm trying to eliminate any of this stuff if it ain't helping me much because of the costs. And lastly, I realized that my username may make me seem like a huge douche, but just know that I was messing/joking around typing in different names and don't know why that's what I went with, but like yeah, just sayin. Sorry if I'm a bit TMI and overdid it with the details a bit, I just kinda do that sometimes..",4,0

I learned via reddit (of course) that I could strain the pills through a large syringe and get almost pure codeine, it got hard to keep this habit up over 4 years in a smallish town, pharmacies start to get wise but eventually they stopped selling the codeine aspirin combo so I had to find something as I was on a large dose several times a day. Kratom to the rescue, I had tried it several times but never really got high before buying it from a local head shop and giving it a real chance. Oh and how the first year, even year and a half were GLORIOUS. A LEGAL PAIN KILLER TYPE DRUG I CAN BUY ON THE INTERNET OR AT A HEAD SHOP?!? I must have spent 5 grand in my first year on Kratom, I dread even trying to calculate the cost.

**Quitting:** Almost 2 years in, 30 to 50 grams a day depending on how good the stuff I had was and I start to get bad pains in my back, I can tell it's my kidneys. Not to mention the pain in my lungs whenever I got physical. I actually lost about 50 lbs at one point excising alongside Kratom, but I gained it all back by 2020 and of course, then the pandemic hit. I am a father and a husband and my wife has no idea the drugs I do. I kept thinking ""what if I get covid, my lungs and kidneys, probably even my liver are severely compromised right now."" 

So back in March I started a tapering schedule, I was able to cut my dose down severely from 30 grams to 15, maybe 3 grams a day 5 times. I used measuring spoons and kept going down until I was at a teaspoon. I def got tired of withdrawing though, I doubled my dose and forced my self back down 2 or 3 times but now I'm almost done and I just needed to talk to someone. I guess this post will have to do. I literally tapered down to 2 tiny teaspoons a day last weekend down to 1 teaspoon at night. I even went 28 hours between doses. I threw out 500 grams of Kratom too. I just kept going ""sooner or later I will use this"". 

Last night was the worst sleep, at 1:30am I had to take a small dose, I had work in the morning. I zombie my way through everything. I've been trying to be active but at this point I have no energy what so ever and I get angry really easy. I've been vaping weed (no smell so I can do it without my wife noticing), but if you know weed, it won't save you once you're really acclimated to it. I just fell asleep on the couch for about 45 minutes, woke up feeling like death. Wife keeps wondering why I am sleeping in the spare room, I just say I have insomnia. Even though I've been doing 1/10th the Kratom for a months now my lungs still hurt. My kidneys still aren't 100%. I guess I should go see a doctor :(  


**End for now... :** So I guess I'm almost out of the woods tapering. I know cold turkey would be the worst, I am glad I was able to keep on the wagon and limit my self to this point but as far as I have come I doubt I will feel normal for weeks or months. Restless legs are the WORST. I'm going to take my last pills tonight before bed, hopefully get some sleep. Not excited about being a Zombie for however long. Maybe I'll come back and tell y'all how it went.",22,2
122,2020-07-24 19:45:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hxcndo/vivitrol/,Vivitrol,"Vivitrol has prevented me from relapsing, I physically can not get high on opiates like kratom.  Vivitrol is basically time release naltrexone that is a once a month injection so you can't skip a dose and get high like you can with naltrexone. It is not available as a generic and is very expensive. Check with your doctor and insurance if it will be covered, or perhaps your psych can give you a one dose sample for free to get you started. Naltrexone/vivitrol is a powerful opiod antagonist. The only thing that can break through the blockade is basically something like remifentanyl or carfentanyl, but they'd have to be administered in incredibly precise dosages, otherwise you could overdose and die very easily. Even an expert anesthesiologist would have trouble calibrating the proper dose to circumvent the naltrexone blockade. All this to say, heroin, kratom, oxycontin, fentanyl, etc. will not work on you and will have no effect. So you are running a risk that if you get into some sort of car accident or accident where opiates would typically be administered, they will not work. Even if you tell the ER doc you are on an opiod blocker, they likely won't care and still give you a regular dose of opiates and nothing more, which will be completely blocked and you'll feel everything, unless they put you under. Consequently, endorphins are blocked as well, as endorphins are just your body's natural opiods (endorphin is a portmanteau of endogenous morphine). So you won't feel so great for a little while, I haven't felt very well the past two weeks, but I haven't relapsed and so I don't regret it. On the plus side, powerful opiod antagonism upregulates your opiate receptors, so when you come off it, your endorphins kick in stronger and you feel fucking great after exercise. I can't wait until then but I might stay on vivitrol a few more months until my life stabilizes and the cravings go down. The last thing you should know is that if you get prescribed naltrexone or vivitrol, you should abstain from opiates for 7-10 days before having it administered. If you have any kind of physical dependence on opiods such as kratom, you could have something called precipitated withdrawals. You can google it but its basically 5 days worth of acute withdrawals concentrated into 8-20 hours and can be life threatening, while typically opiate withdrawal is not. Its horrific.

So I know I’ve been posting a lot on here, and maybe I’m not out of the woods yet, but something just clicked a few hours ago and I feel...normal. This is where it gets sketchy for me because (1) I don’t believe it and (2) I feel like I didn’t “suffer enough”, but this time is GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. 


It’s interesting that 30g seems like a lot to people here because that’s literally the smallest size bag I can buy in town. If I want to drive 45m I can get a 1/5oz, but within 10m of my house in think rinky dinky little shit hole I can get 1oz/30g-ish for $10. I am NOT good at tapering, so if I buy an oz I take an oz. This is dumb and I would not suggest it. 

I teach psychiatric special ed and it gave my life meaning until the school shutdown in March. Right around the same time my entire family was out of the country and I had been clean the longest time ever (from Xmas) til the day Trump announced the travel ban. 

I had gone back to my home town in Georgia for Christmas and quitting was stupid easy, I think I tapered without trying, I was super busy and there was plenty to do and help with so I just stayed occupied, I had brought some from home but I knew it wasn’t going to be enough for the whole trip and the plan was to quit while I was there. I did and I didn’t even want any for months. No issue. Driving past the old hook up spot and not even thinking twice. It was a miracle.
Then the travel ban, my whole family in Europe, I can’t get in touch, no information coming out. Honestly if they were going to get sick being there wouldn’t be so bad, I was paranoid I was going to be stuck here taking care of everything alone for who knows how long. I caved. They made it back, I was back to 30g a day by the time they set foot in the states. Since then it’s been up and down. I’ve had a few days here or a week there but nothing stuck. Kratom doesn’t even really do a damn thing for my any more, except stop the withdrawals, so what’s the point? 

So this time I made a plan, more or less (I’m about as bad at planning as tapering, but hey it was worth a shot):
-attempt figure out what was keeping me drinking heavily then using kratom (eating disorder, trauma) and get myself into a non/hospitalization but intensive program for that 
-cut back on drinking all together - nothing but 1-3 Miller lites a night, if that. No “fancy beer”, no getting drunk (this was hard but far less hard than it used to be; kratom makes me not want to drink when I get past the point where the K isn’t doing jack shit for me anymore)
-No lying to myself. If I buy some, no making rules like “oh, I’ll do have today and half tomorrow night” - it’s not going to happen. If anything I’ll do the other half in the morning and buy more later that day. This helped me get out of rationalizing using it to myself, and helped me realize even if I took 30g at 9pm all it was going to do was make me want to stare at my phone til 2am and ruin my next day, or take it in the morning and ruin the next day anyways. 
-Start weaning myself off my phone. Kratom was a big excuse for me to just stare at my phone for hours, and hours and then Sunday rolls around and I averaged 8hrs a day that week and wanted to die 
-$$$$

I’m not sure what the exact impetus to quit was this time. IOP started Wednesday and I wanted to NOT use while in IOP. Period. It would defeat the purpose (again, $$$ IOP ain’t cheap)

I tried to CT Monday, failed, Tuesday, failed, went to help a friend clean his house Wednesday morning and felt okay til about noon. Came home. Agony. i made it to the first IOP session Wednesday at 3:30 and had a total meltdown. Had to call out of then other two sessions. I decided enough was enough. Took my night time psych meds and went to bed at like 7pm. 

Thursday, wake up screaming in agony, not just restless legs, restless everything. I felt like a fish with no water. Alternating between freezing cold and sweating through my clothes. Called my mom to help water my garden. She said i sounded like I was being stabbed. Popped clonazepam app day to sleep for an hour or two at a time. Horrible, hyper realistic night mares. Couldn’t keep any food down. Finally ate a bowl of cereal at 10pm and passed out again (thanks clonazepam).

Was supposed to have a meeting at school this morning 9am. When my alarm went off I was already hysterical. Texted principal I wasn’t feeling well. Screamed at my dad on the phone. Alternated couch time bed to couch to bed clothes no clothes blankets, sweating, crying, feeling like my skin was on fire. Then something happened. I have no idea what.

About 12:30 I calmed down. Had an appt with my nutritionist. Tried to explain what was going on. She seemed skeptical because I was level headed. I have no idea what happened. I wasn’t taking more or less and anything, didn’t get any real sleep either night.

My FEAR of the withdrawals (this time) was WAY worse than the actual experience. Oh now it has NOT always gone this well. But over all 

March 12 to July 24, 30g a day with at the most 7 disjointed days off, a 48 hour WD. Wtf. 

THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO’S BEEN FOLLOWING MY STORY. I sort of feel like I’m shouting into the void, but I try not to let my folks see how bad my life gets and my single friend here has his own demons. 

Now I know comes the hard part - not giving into temptation. But I got this, I want it more than ever before. I hope everyone dealing with WD right now has some sort of deux ex machina moment like I did. Wtf, but I’m not complaining.

I have been using kratom every day since March. I just recently got a pretty bad batch in terms of potency from Kracken Kratom, and honestly, I might have unknowingly tapered my dose a lot, because I had a lot of anxiety and increased depression that week. My new kratom came, and its by far the most potent I have yet had. Good and bad, because this way I can consume less plant matter, but then I can also easily dive deeper into tolerance and dependency. This kratom is so powerful. 

I have been taking 16-30g/d. Would you recommend a taper before I go off of it? 

I have some 4-fluorophenibut coming by mail so I can ease my anxiety/relax my muscles here and there. It has about half of the duration of phenibut and is more sedating and less euphoric than phenibut. I had no issues tapering this chemical to get off of phenibut in April and I want to use it again for my kratom WDs.",2,0

I started to measure just with a tablespoon. After doing that for a week I then started to write down every dose and never go over 3 a day...so this has involved some discomfort...every 8 hours instead of 6. But here’s the good news:  I figured each tbls was 12 grams which would make me a 36gpd kratomite. But today I searched for  and found my gram scale and that tbls only came to 8.7 grams!!!!  So I have already tapered just by measuring. I will go till sun at 26.1 gpd. Mom I will switch to 23 gpd...one less in each dose. This feels so incredibly sane to me. Also, I now think those 8 long miserable months 2 years ago must be working in my favor. I am using mostly diet and juice fasting to help. In fact last week I juice fasted for 6 days and that inspired me to quit smoking which I have done successfully thanks to Allen Carr and way too much Haagen Das. Monday I’ll start e new fast as that will help me so much with tapering because I get so much energy, spiritual and physical, from juice fasting and raw foods. So now I am an official QKer👌🤟🧑🏻‍🎤",2,0

I began taking kratom daily maybe 4 years ago or so. At first (as it was with everyone here) it was great! I loved that excited buzz it gave me and helped with my chronic anxiety as well. But man oh man has it been a fresh fucking hell these past 2 years. I've lost jobs and a relationship because I have lost all self control and was on a path of righteous destruction. The things I feel from k these days are nothing except EXTREME brain fog, Wierd fucking pressure in my head that feels like a tumor (it's not thankfully), loss of ability to maintain relationships, agoraphobia ( most likely just exacerbated anxiety) and a whole slew of digestive fuckyness. I cant do this anymore boys. I'm done with this shit so hard. I finally have real tangible things in my life to be happy about right now and the kratom is just muting that happiness. I feel like I've done irreparable to my brain (hope not) but i just flushed everything a little while ago so tomorrow is day 1 FINALLY. Please I'd love some backup emotionally for this as I know I'll need it. Thanks for your time. P.S. any humor is greatly appreciated.

I started doing Lortabs in 2012-1013 on the weekends with my fire chief to mend a broken heart. I had gotten firefighter of the year 2x in a row, and was quite frankly a beast at it. It was just a natural talent for me to run in to a burning mess. I was a monkey on a hose, and the adrenaline spike was what I needed! I left that to go to the military, and in basic I fell about 8 foot in an awkward way, and my leg stayed straight, but below my knee went left. Blew the knee out. This was close to the end of basic training. I was met with the option of healing and staying, or going home. I called home and found out my grandmother whom raised me was just diagnosed with early onset dementia, her being my world. I inquired about staying, and they told me that I would heal for 27 weeks in basic training, then start back at week 0. Starting completely over. I didn't agree and like an idiot, I said see ya later alligator and came back home. Might I mention that I was withdrawing quite heavily for the first time in my life, right in basic training and I didn't know what I was going through. Suboxone was my devil at this point, and they blatantly didn't test for it yet. 

Fast forward to getting home. I stopped at Zales, and thanks to my grandfather, I had amazing credit. The girl I'd been with had asked several times when I was going to ask her to marry me, so I dropped all of my money from basic training on this princess cut, chocolate diamond from Zales, and financed roughly 8500 more. I loved the trifling hoe. I got back and right before I asked her to marry me, she said hey, before you do that, I need you to know that I can't be with someone in the military, so I married my ex husband's best friend, who is active duty Navy. Thank God for Zales' beautiful return policy! I rushed to my best friend's house, my fire chief, and I got soooo beyond loaded on tabs, xanaxes, and Jager Bombs. In steps my birth mother whom opened the doors of hell on Suboxone and Klonopin, and before I knew it, I was in the clinic getting way too much prescribed to me, and a needle hanging out of my arm. 

Fast forward to 2019, around June. I looked my ex up on Facebook and messaged her a LONG message letting her know how I felt, how she had quite literally destroyed my world, and how I still couldn't manage to get over her. I blocked her immediately. In September, on her birthday, she created an account under her maiden name and messaged me. We spoke for a couple of weeks, and I came soooo close to breaking a marriage up just to do it out of spite, but I couldn't do it because I did truly love her and I wanted nothing more than for her to be happy, and I'm just not the kind of man to break a marriage up, or a relationship up regardless of my own selfish feelings. I swore I was now sober etc, which she bought, and then she caught me in two small lies and the heat was on about how could you lie to me after 7 years etc... I was like okay, I'm the bad person when you're the one that left me while I was gone, married your ex husband's best friend, took your child away from me that called me daddy, and again, married the man that you told everyone you only dated for a month to spite your ex husband and told everyone he was nothing more than a rebound, fine. This bothered me. It bothered me because I had lied, about being sober. I didn't want to lie anymore. 

Kratom was illegal for a long time where I'm from, but I had tried it once when I was sick, and it had helped me. I swore if it ever became legal, then I'd take my open door and leave the Klonopins and Suboxone and the needle behind for good. Now, I've not told this much before, but here's exactly what happened. For 6 nights I had this reoccuring nightmare where I couldn't see anything, and I couldn't move or talk, but I could hear this man's voice saying ""This isn't you, this isn't who you're supposed to be, don't you understand that you truly only get one shot at this life?"", and then I'd wake up and it would be 3 am on the dot, covered in sweat, heart pounding, breathing heavily. That 6th night, I fell back to sleep and woke up that morning, and my uncle was like hey, have you ever heard of Kratom? I was like yeah, he pulled out a bag. It was legal again. That's not the crazy part. That night I went to bed, and I fell back in to this nightmare, the man saying the same thing, but I woke up out of it this time, and there was a man, very majestic standing in front of me in a white gown, blondish brown hair, and he said ""If you'll stop this right now, I'll give you everything you've ever wanted, and more than you could ever imagine. It's okay, it's over."", and he was gone. This single moment changed the course of history for me, forever. I now believed there was a God. I fell back to sleep, and woke up that morning and said papaw, take my prescriptions and lock them up, I'm done today. An entire month of Suboxone and Klonopin that I had just filled, I handed to him and he took to the safe. I went and bought a bag of Kratom and started taking 3 grams 3x a day, and it helped some, but I still violently withdrew for 24 days straight all while taking care of my grandmother in late term dementia, and also while working a 40 an hour a week job. I took the Kratom at that amount for 8 months and 3 days until I lost my job due to not being able to hold my temper back. The Kratom shuffle had turned on me. I was looking only to time's I could finally redose, and I was noticing different things, so one day I said alright, gotta rip this band aid on off and do this, else I'm about to take a stupid ride on this roller coaster again! That was 30 days ago.

I can't really tell you how to do what you're here to achieve other than telling you to stop worrying about what you're going to experience, and to just rip that band aid off and ride the bull and find out what will happen. For me, Kratom was a stepping stone in my sobriety, but it nearly became something else for me. I'd like to tell you that the Kratom withdrawals were easy, and in comparison to the opiates and benzo's I was addicted to for 6 years, it was, but simply, there's no addiction nor withdraw that's easy to break or go through. Yeah, there's going to be restless nights, aches and pains, mind racing, depression, all kinds of stuff, but I can tell you that it subsides rather quickly. You've got to dig deep in your mind and do this for yourself. Not for anyone else. I can tell you that it's worth it, and it's possible with a little bit of leg work and dedication! If this old needle junkie, Kratom using addict can crawl out of that hole, then anyone can. Try it. You just might surprise yourself!",16,0

As my title mentions, I was mostly taking extracts - OPMS and K shots but really whatever I could afford would do. 

I used Kratom because I liked how it made me feel. I continued to use Kratom because I became addicted both physically and mentally. 

Towards the end of my use, I thought I might never be able to actually stop buying and putting kratom in my body. I was terrified. I wanted so badly to stop but it was like another force was compelling me to take this nasty shit. 

71 days since my last OPMS shot, 70 days clean and I feel better than I’ve felt since I ever started drinking or doing drugs. I’ve come to realize more recently, I don’t naturally suffer from anxiety or depression. It has always been self-induced with substances. When I’m in my natural state - I feel amazing. Obviously we all have our good and bad days, nothing is permanent, everything is temporary - but being sober and feeling good really doesn’t have to be, if you make that choice. At least that’s how it is for me.

My life is SO much better kratom free. I am so grateful to this group for helping me overcome this vicious addiction. It has helped beyond words I can’t put together at this moment.

I took some in the morning and that was the last of what i had. Towards the evening of that day I felt pretty shitty. I had to go to a family party on the 4th of july that evening and could hardly eat and felt intense anxiety before the party. By the second day I feltipd nausea and was shitting like 5 times an hour. I told myself that by the end if my shift I was gonna say fuck it and buy some kratom cause I couldn't take working early shifts and getting hardly any sleep like this. This week I had 2 days off in a row and the day that I worked I took some in the morning and didn't bother with any more kratom the rest of the day. Today is my first day going completely without it but my second day in the quitting process. Its not as rough as the first time but it sucks. I hate the restless feeling and getting hardly any sleep. It makes me want to go back to taking kratom.,4,0

About 1 year ago I came across someone recommending kratom to help with depression and anxiety. I had been off of antidepressants for 4 years prior and did not want to get back on them.  I was and still am not on any other type of drug or medication.

When I first began I noticed myself taking more and more until I got up to about 4 teaspoons 3 times a day (not sure of the weight as I only took it by the spoon). Back in around February or March of this year I noticed that as much as I was taking was making my anxiety worse, so I cut back to 3 teaspoons 2 times a day with no problem. 

I have finally decided to completely quit because I feel that it is not working for me the way that it did when I first began, not to mention I want to prepare my body for a baby and have nothing in me that can bring any harm to my child. 

There has been a few times that I would take a 2-3 day break and have no problems, but I did replace it with alcohol so that may have been why I did not have any withdrawal symptoms. 

My initial decision was to quit cold turkey (that was a couple of days ago). Yesterday I did fine, but last night was horrible. I tossed and turned all night, my legs and feet were restless, I was having hot and cold sweats, body aches and this morning I was so sick on my stomach I felt like I was going to throw up. 

After doing a quick little research I have decided to taper off because as this day has gone on I've noticed that I'm better physically until I'm trying to relax has made me irritable, the body aches and restless legs are still there, not to mention my mental and emotional state of mind. 

I have just took 2 teaspoons (which would be 1/3 of my normal dose) and waiting for it to relax me. I don't have anyone that I can talk to about this and my husband does not take it, so he is really no help with anything. I do not want to take it anymore at all, but the withdrawal is real. 

Thanks for taking your time to read and any recommendations or kind words are appreciated. 
Good luck and prayers for us all!

If you're just dosing by spoonfuls out of a bag/jar/whatever, and you're not weighing nor shaking said container before dosing, then the kratom is going to pack down more tightly with every dig of your spoon, leading you to larger and larger doses.

When I first got my scale, it happened to coincide with me getting a new bag of kratom, which I poured into a jar, as usual. I started weighing my doses, and as I got further down into the jar, the doses--at a teaspoon per--were getting heavier. It took me a few days to figure out why this was happening: settling. With every scoop, with every clank of the jar being set on the counter, the kratom was settling. Though I of course adjusted for my usual dose (3g), I kept testing through to the end of a quart jar. I can't remember the exact range, but it was something like 3ish grams per teaspoon at the beginning to nearly SIX at the end! So you can see, of course, how this can lead to higher and higher doses and tolerance.

And if you're trying to come off of it, consistent dosing is key. If you're usually taking 3g/1tsp per dose, and you've cut down to half a teaspoon by the end of a jar...you could still be taking 3g!

So anyway...if you're not gonna weigh it, then at least shake your container every time to fluff it all back up and get a consistent amount. Hope that helps!",3,0

I first discovered K about 3 years ago; quickly my use progressed into about 20-30 gpd. It originally did everything that was intended, increased focus, that short-lived burst of euphoria, reduction in depression... until it didn’t. 

Fast forward to March of this year and I dropped my usage to 12GPD abruptly with mimimal w/d sxs other than some insomnia, and I kept decreasing the dose (kind of a rapid taper?) until I hit 2 gpd. Last Thursday I jumped and have not felt any symptoms other than generalized malaise/anhedonia at random times throughout the day. No RLS or insomnia this quit which I consider a HUGE blessing. I miss the boost it gave me, the enhanced sociability and perception of myself.

Guess I just came here to talk a little bit and share my experience, and let those of you worrying about jumping that not everybody gets the horrific w/d symptoms we are so accustomed to reading here.

I think I've finally got this thing beat! I'm on day 83 if I'm counting right. I have tried to quit around 7 times before. I seemed to have a hangup around the 5 week mark. If i didn't get triggered to a relapse before that point by something in my life, I just seemed to cave at around that point. I can't really put my finger on what made it stick for me this time. So my best advice to anyone is to just keep trying. If you relapse, try to keep the relapse short, and do another quit. I don't think there's a magic solution. I never had significant withdrawal symptoms physically, and I don't see supplements as having played much of a role for me. I'm not sure if other people have some kind of hump to get over, like I did with the 5 weeks thing. But once I hit that six week mark, and it was a personal best, time started moving faster. I don't think about kratom or crave it now. Well I felt tempted the other day for a minute but it passed and that was the first time in a month or more. I'm not sure how I feel about the PAWS idea, but the whole idea of brain zaps feels like it speaks to something I experienced, that went away at some point. Mostly sleeping better than when I was using kratom. I had the occasional sleepless night this summer but don't even think it's related. I continue to have a fondness for energy shots and edibles. But gonna let my energy shot stash run out this week. I don't plan to quit weed but gonna be cutting back there too. I live my life as though I think weed is harmless and helpful, but I don't truly believe that anymore. My situation reminds me of Mark manson's book ""The Subtle Art of not Giving a Fuck,"" he talks about how we create happiness in our lives by solving problems. There's always a problem to solve, so the idea is that as we move along in our path, we end up with better problems to solve. So that's how I feel about my substance issue, I'm happier now and will work on my weed habit, but i see it as a better problem to have in my life than a kratom habit. So that's what I wish for everyone here, to find your way through this one, get happier and have better problems to solve. Also, I can finally enjoy anice glass of orange juice without associating it with any bad-tasting sludge. It's nice to enjoy a glass of OJ.

170,2020-07-21 16:40:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hvfdz8/if_you_hate_exercise/,if you hate exercise...,"...try *starting light*. It seems like most of the time when someone here mentions how important it is to get more exercise, they either leave it at that or they follow it up with talk about ""hitting the gym"" or ""running \[x\] miles,"" etc.  If you're like me and you've never really liked exercise, and you've let yourself get seriously out of shape (doesn't matter how much is due to the kratom vs. ""just me,"" it is what it is regardless) hearing phrases like those can fill you with dread. But, you can't mentally compare yourself with those for whom ""that stuff"" has never been a problem. You know, the people who say ""I got off kratom and now I'm powerlifting again!"" Everyone's struggles both in and out of the context of kratom addiction are different, and some of us struggle with the *physical* aspect of getting back into the swing of life more than others do. I am one of those people.

THAT BEING SAID-- about a week and a half after final quit here, I've found that getting *just* enough exercise to put a healthy strain on my body is the single best thing I've done toward making myself feel better (much more than any of the supplements or other remedies)-- so much so that I am making myself do some each day just because I don't want to miss out on the improved mood and state of mind that come from it.

I'm not a fitness expert, but I can say what is working for me. The yoga ball has been my very good friend. Yoga ball pushups (balance your crotch/lower abdomen on the ball and do pushups like that). Yoga ball situps/crunches. Yoga ball squats (ball wedged between your back and the wall). Yoga ball leglifts. There are some good Youtube videos on how to do these, among other ""easier"" exercises many of which don't require equipment or even leaving your house. I'm also doing planks, calf raises, and working my forearms with a homemade weighted wrist-roller. No cardio... yet.

The exercises I'm doing are light, low impact (especially good with the state my knee and back are in!), and nothing super intense. Each session is not this big all-or-nothing-fest where I either score an A+ in fitness by cranking out the Herculean ordeal of a lifetime or get an F, throw my hands up and give up and go plop on the couch. I do each thing until I feel just enough of a burn and then the last couple/few reps are hard to complete and when I'm done my muscles have this wonderful ""can finally breathe"" kind of feeling and I get not only the pleasurable endorphins but also... hmm.. how to explain this... it's like when you've exercised your muscles sufficiently, your body goes a little bit easier on your mind. You've given it what it needs, so it lets you feel more stable, fulfilled, and focused. Again, it is doing more for my mood and functioning than *anything* else I am doing. Also, I am conditioning my previously weakened muscles, which will increasingly make the prospect of a ""real workout"" less daunting (perhaps even inviting).

I feel confident that if I keep doing what I'm doing, I will naturally decide upgrade to more strenuous exercise (in fact, I figure I will increasingly have to if I want to experience the same endorphins and other benefits). But, for now, I'm working with what I've got here with my out-of-shape self. The important thing is that I am doing it (with the aim of making it a habit, that's the real meat of the importance...), and I am feeling the benefits.

I hope this is helpful and/or inspiring to someone. Just remember 1. exercising will help you more than you know; 2. it's not all-or-nothing (that seems to be a really big psychological block, especially for people who've had substance issues). ""A little bit of something is better than a lot of nothing.""; 3. what someone else is doing exercise-wise is not necessarily what you need to be doing.",32,0

Got some, they suggested kratom as well. Stupidly I got both. Tried cbd at first and it helped. Tried kratom and gave me a headache, so the next time I went to the shop I only got cbd. Cbd stopped working and actually gave me anxiety, so I gave kratom another shot and here we are today. I am tapering and it is going fine so far, I am around 11gpd now. The reasons I want to stop are:
1. I want to travel
2. It's too expensive 
3. I don't like the fact that I am a slave to it
4. I am concerned about consequences on my health
5. I am afraid it may cause me problems in my future career. More on that. I am taking prerequisite classes to qualify for an associate's degree program in the medical field.

I want to change my life and become more active and I am working towards it. But I am afraid of PAWs. And not just that, I am afraid of the lack of focus. Here is my most recent experience. I was taking 3 different kinds from different shops. last month when I got my batch, the guy there told me ""good choice, this is fresh"". I don't know what it was in it, but it felt a lot stronger. I finished that bag and decided not to get it again, just taper with the other 2 I have left. But the last 3 days I have not been able to retain any of the information I have been reading for my upcoming exam. Yesterday I hoped in the car 30 minutes before the store closing and got another bag. I am still tapering. But taking this kratom last night allowed me to remember most of the material within several hours. I will have 3 weeks in between classes in August. I am taking all and any advice how successfully drop this addiction and still be productive.",2,0

I haven't been satisfied with looking around and thinking this was what was wrong with me or that was wrong with me so I started getting more specific and stumbled across something relating to opioids and bradycardia.  
I noticed my heart rate ranges in the mid 50s to 60s which I believe isn't normal and anything under 60 is considered bradycardia.  
This would explain why Kratom started causing fluttering in my chest (which is my main reason for quitting) but now I'm questioning if this is going to reverse it? Idk, I'm somewhat scared and don't have access to a health care provider other than the hospital and they're swarmed with COVID-19 patients so that's very risky to go to during withdrawals + I don't know if there is much the hospital can do for me.

Feeling good, yesterday I didn't sneeze at all for some reason, haven't done my morning sneezing ritual today either. My sleep has stabilized quite well with the help of an OTC sleep aid, I mean I've over slept twice in 3 days. I've noticed that if I give in and take a nap in the day, then I won't sleep for crap that night, so there's something to watch out for. Tomorrow will be 9 months off of Suboxone and Klonopin after quitting it CT, and 9 months off of that devilish needle, so I'm quite excited about that! I got accepted to the networking class in my local trade college as well, yesterday. I know I originally had planned on following my father's footsteps and doing Industrial Electricity, but number one, a factory just isn't for me, and number two, I'm already quite amazing on computers, so some certificates will help. I'm also stoked about getting more experience on servers, switches, etc. Here's to even more better days! If you're thinking about giving up, don't do it man! I'm 28, nowhere in life, have an abusive father that's controlled me all of my life (and I've only realized it with the help of a counselor in the pas year), and I'm also primarily caring for my mother with late term dementia, and on top of that I have to sit and listen to him beg her to talk of the mornings when her brain is not functioning at all, get pissed off and yell, no he doesn't yell, scream at her. Then between 2p and 730p is the worst of it all because she gets talkative and she can't say anything, very few thigs like ""Hello!, You want some?, You want it?, Yeah, I reckon."" and gibberish, and he wants to lay down right when she decides to get talkative, so then I have to listen to him scream at the top of his lungs for hours on end. I try to leave to get some space and time away and he begs me and makes all the excuses in the world for me to stay, etc. He has all vehicles in his name so that I can't just up and jet on him. Just an abusive asshole that wants to sit and talk smack about everyone else going to hell for the things they've done, and how he's so perfect, and I want nothing more than to smack his bitch ass and let him know that his seat is reserved in hell. It's not going to deter me away from getting what little bit of schooling I need, and staying clean! If I can make it, you can! For goodness sakes, I'm sitting here at 28, being another man's little bitch, allowing myself to be abused for the sake of my mother, controlled in every way fathomable, made it off of the needle on my own, then made it off of Kratom on my own, and to top it off, I'm literally watching my mother, the most important woman in my life, deteriorate in to death. I promise, things seem very tough, but you must remember that one day you WILL look back and only remember the good and how simple times seemed compared to whatever your going through. I know one day I'll look back at this and somehow tell myself, if only I could go back to that moment and capture it. The messed up and diseased minds we have as addicts! It's crazy! Keep on going everyone! Remember, you only have to make it until the time you go to sleep, sober! Don't look too far ahead! It's only overwhelming! Feelings come and go! Don't ruin your plans over 10 minutes of emotion! I love all of you! If you need someone to talk to, please feel free to message me!",9,0

Edit: I now  finally understand why I feel so weird after quitting Haha I am not from a english speaking nation, also a little bit depersonalized so exuce me for my grammar mistakes.

Like alot of people here I was surprised that I felt so weird after withdrawal, like a feeling of depersonalization and other issues. Currently I am on day 20 and while most opioid withdrawal symptoms are gone and I can sleep again, I feel still weird as fuck. I am manic, I experience brain zaps and I have a thigtness in my chest. All of this symptoms are basically known from antidepressant withdrawal.

 I expected only a mild opiat withdrawal for a week. And yes the first week was basically a weak opiat withdrawal, but after the first week I got all of this weird symptoms, where I didnt understand what was happening. I often made T-breaks and I never experienced this symtpoms, so I was really worried.

Why do I still have this weird symtoms ? I thought it should be over by now ? Did I damage my brain ?

Then I started searching on the internet and I found about the serotonin effect kratom has on the brain. Kratom is basically a natural tramadol. I remember what my  best friend said a few years ago, I was taking kratom with him, he tried it the first time and didnt expect much from it, after I told him its a legal plant you can buy on the internet. After 20 minutes he asks me ""This is legal ? This feels alot like my tramadol prescription I have taken years ago""

Think about it, when you take a low dose of kratom, how  do you feel ? I atleast felt very stimulated and talkactive, so kratom has definitly an effect on serotonin, maybe not as strong as tramal, but 100% some activity. Tomorrow I go to a doctor and tell him my situation, maybe he has some medications that help against antidepressant withdrawal.

A few good quotes I found:

""mitragynine increasingly acts upon μ-opioid in a similar manner to traditional opioids. This is speculated to be one of the reasons that kratom has a stimulating effect at lower doses and sedating effects at higher doses.\[8\] Unlike most other opioids, kratom also presents affinity for the κ-opioid\[9\], norepinephrine and serotonin\[10\] receptor systems where it functions as an agonist. Its action on norepinephrine and serotonin also likely contributes to kratom's stimulating properties.""

&#x200B;

""Kratom acts as a D2 and 5HT2A antagonist- meaning it’s prevents dopamine and serotonin from doing it’s thing at specific sites. Do this long enough and the brain thinks “oh shit we don’t have enough activity at these receptors time to make more” and “upregulates” them— only to have them antagonized again until a steady dose is in effect and it maintains the amount it has. When you take kratom out of the equation suddenly you have massive amounts of receptors and dopamine/serotonin starts to stimulate them at once.

It is also a 5HT3 agonist- meaning it’s binds directly to the receptor (hence the nausea associated with high doses).

D2 (Dopamin Receptor)  is responsible for your reward system- leading to mania, excess libido (in some cases) psychosis, and fatigue when overstimulated.

5HT2A (Serotonin Receptor) is heavily implicated in insomnia, psychosis, suicidal thinking, anxiety, headaches, depression etc.

5HT3 (Serotonin Receptor) relates to digestion and appetite, ties into the reward system as well and raises neurotransmitter activity across the board. Since this one is an agonist and was bombarded with excess from the kratom the brain does the opposite of the two above and ‘downregulates’ the receptor which means it causes less sites that serotonin can bind to and less activity.""

When you look at all these receptors kratom is effecting its absolutly no wonder that you still feel like shit, despite the opioid withdrawal symptoms ending. Your serotoninsystem takes a long time to fully recover, so give it time. If you want more information just google antidepressant withdrawal. 

Withdrawing from kratom after high daily doses for years is basically an antidepressant withdrawal plus a weak opioid withdrawal. Thats why it takes so long to feel normal again.",40,0

Symptoms are mild right now, RLS is noticeably the most frustrating and awfulStarted getting chills / goosebumps, sneezing, yawning frequently, runny nose / watery eyes (mostly subsided), RLS, muscle aches, stomach discomfort I.E nausea

Oddly, when I get chills and such it feels like the euphoria Kratom gave me once upon a timeHasn't done that for some months now, honestly it made me stop caring about everything and everyone along with killing the individual I was prior to usingI used to be funny, smart, open minded, self aware..Writing that just made me think of something, the last month leading up to my panic attack I realized the prior months my anxiety and depression was on a steady increase and caused me to shut down and get away from everyone along with losing interest in everything I've loved and enjoyed all my life (Games, music, food, reading, studying, movies, shows and a lot more) I mean seriously, music is my life and I stopped listening to it altogether just abruptly and it made my depression so much worseMentally, I've had this looped thought of ""Once you're feeling better, start using again""I've looked in the mirror a few times today and flicked myself off lolI'm committed to getting clean for both my mental and physical health along with spending (hopefully) the rest of my life with my amazing supportive GF

Honestly, if the panic attack didn't cause me lingering shortness of breath and weird heart palpitations I'm positive I'd still be using Kratom and continuing my life.. not really much of a life though is it? Life means to live, Kratom takes the life right out of you and literally makes you feel trapped (as do most addictions I've suffered from, this one feels a little more sinister though? Maybe it was the ignorant advocates saying 'Kratom is safe, non-addictive, can't overdose, can't die from it' which is a load of bullshit and me of all people shouldn't have believed a single word of it""With that being said, I'll add I'm not blaming the substance for my misuse and abuseThat is entirely on me, I made the decision to abuse it when I knew betterThe reason I was so careless with it was the belief you couldn't experience serious side effects, just mild side effects like nausea and shit like thatBut honest to God the only side effect I had over 1 year + was SEVERE constipationLike my stomach stopped functioning AND anorexiaI've been able to keep my food down now that I'm off Kratom and the craziest part is I'm feeling nausea from the withdrawal and more reliable to keep my food down than if I were using Kratom

I looked into some of the supplements recommended, so far I've been using Black Seed OilI'd say that may be why my withdrawal isn't as intense as I originally expected it should be by now, it was worst yesterday compared to today which doesn't make sense to me since it was just the 2nd dayAnyway, gonna get some Magnesium Glycinate as recommended by a friend (also saw it on the supplements page here for quitting, thanks for recommendation)

Alright I'm running out of energy, I'ma wrap this up nowI wish everyone the absolute best of luck in your recoveryI'll update this in the following days to share progress""If I can do it, you can do it"" is no joke, I never imagined this day would come but here I am (not my intentions but the panic attack scared the life out of me and ruined Kratom for me, caused more anxiety taking it and induced panic) just remind yourself why you're quitting and maybe take into consideration that Kratom isn't helping you anymore, it's imprisoning youYou all have my best wishes, take care and healthy recovering!

It was an absolute mindfuck that I wanted to quit so bad for months and months and anytime I got close, tapered or started to CT I bailed and went back. I read this forum daily for over a year and kept thinking this is my time. Guess what, until I read a few posts about a complete mental overhaul and a change of perspective I realize now I had no chance. I’m free from Kratom for exactly 100 days (I just counted and realized this), but the only thing that gave me a chance was watching a shit load of David Goggins, and a mental attitude of “I can’t wait to suffer, feel this pain, and eat absolute shit today” (Eat shit is my metaphorical way of describing CT and paws). Anyway, I kept trying to make the pain less, by taking this, or eating that, or taking these, yada yada, and in retrospect the only reason why I was finally successful was because I completely changed my mindset and instead of wanting it to be easy, I decided I wanted to suffer as much as I could and I didn’t care how bad it was cuz I was gonna be excited to take that shit and then be done with this garbage. Guess what, once I did that, I was successful. If u find urself whining about all the WD, try changing ur attitude and hope for the absolute worst, and be excited for it. Anyway at 100 days today and I’m pretty much back to normal.

Now the physical symptoms are pretty much gone but the mental trials have begun.

I feel very depressed and everything feels grey but I know time will heal it. I am trying to do meditation and exercise daily but it is very challenging to motivate myself. I can't think of any activity that sounds enjoyable to me that doesn't involve drugs. Nothing. Not sex, eating, videogames, watching a movie. It all sounds really boring.

I am currently just an emotionless blob with occasional passing feelings of sadness, anxiety, and very rarely a glimpse of happiness.

I also have isolated myself from all my friends during my use period and me and my girlfriend broke up so I am pretty much alone. I also don't feel I am able to socialize right now so I'm very lonely. I have also had some on and off anxiety but not as bad as withdrawals I've had before so I'm pretty happy with that.

I've never been a daily user but sometimes will do 8-12g in a day every other day for five or six days. I've taken a week or more off before without WDs. But recently I've been getting possibly thyroid related issues and am trying to figure out what role kratom plays.

Today was day 4 since my last dose and I've had swollen thyroid, fatigue and irritable anxiety, resting heart rate 90bpm. Weird thing is I felt OK the last three days. Does anyone else get delayed WDs? Like nothing much at all till day 4? One of my friends whos gone through serious kratom WDs said the shit usually hits the fan on day 2, but I felt normal on day 2 since my last dose. I've also been experimenting with ashwagandha which can cause some similar issues so it could be that.

I know no one is really certain how kratom effects thyroid hormones since research is lacking. It seems like it may possibly push some people towards hypothyroidism. I'm wondering if after a dose there's a rebound effect where thyroid hormones go up a little too high. Or it could be the ashwagandha raising thyroid hormones too high?

She wants to take our son and daughter from me.. but I can’t let this happen. I am a former opiate addict who was sober for 3 years before I started using kratom. I was addicted to OxyContin and was taking 120 mg a day for a year before i went to rehab and found sobriety. A friend introduced me to kratom and it filled the hole inside me that I have been trying so hard to avoid.

I have lost all trust with my family because of it, I am desperate to stay sober and would love to hear any advice or tips from you guys/girls. My last dose was 16 hours ago and I have been taking roughly 12-16 grams a day for just over 2 years, however I have went a day without a couple times the last 2 weeks and it was pretty bad. Also I have 5 previous attempts at quitting and the longest I went without kratom was 14 days. I have a meeting scheduled with a substance abuse counselor this week and I have been seeing an addiction psychiatrist the past 6 months. He prescribed me gabapentin and Dexedrine.

I also take 2x5g of Maeng Da daily.

I didn't think any of it. It wasn't making sense that Kratom was causing this, but after doing some research (mostly on this subreddit), it's pointing to kratom being the cause.

It never was for me personally (and I no longer use kratom as I had some other severe side effects) but there were at least 15 people who piped in and said ""me too"" about the hands……no firm conclusion was ever drawn however.""

I know the feeling. Occasionally hand or fingers go numb or tingly while I sleep. Almost like a pinched nerve. Only has ever happened while taking kratom so im sure it's related. I do take daily vitamins and alot of other minerals but it's a rare occasion it happens.

I spent a year trying to keep my kratom use a secret from my fiancé. I was eaten up with shame, guilt, dread, worry of her judgment, how to tell her, etc. eventually, I built up my courage and told her. Her response: “I know. I waited until you told me. What did you think would happen?! Did you think I would get mad and leave you?! We’re going to get through this.”

That put my mind at ease to the point that cutting back and tapering became a much more palatable, possible chore. A huge portion of my mind was dedicated solely to worrying about her. My therapist, a substance abuse specialist, is great, as well.

Second: I’m terrified of PAWS. This is my second time coming off of kratom. The first time was after a relatively short usage time. I CT’ed. It wasn’t fun, but was fairly minimal. I had some tough times but they were few and far between. This time around, I used extracts. Much like the issue with my fiancé, I believe my dread of PAWS is occupying more space in my mind than it should. 

Just talking out loud. Hope everyone is doing great, whether still in the throes of addiction, tapering, CT’ing or in recovery, I appreciate all you contribute.",12,0

Was at about 75GPD when i quit last after about a year of using kratom. The withdrawal symptoms sucked but the worst was the lack of sleep. Was sober 4 months before my most recent stint. Been using 2 months. My usage varies wildly due to me trying to quit every other day and caving after some withdrawal symptoms show. Usually about 50gpd. 

My attempts at quitting this time around seem harder. When i quit last time i had recently lost a job so lack of sleep didnt really effect too much. This time i have attempted a half ass taper. Usually buy 75g of capsules and just take smaller handfuls. Then once im out I'll just get a $5 shot of kratom from gas station at night time tp sleep. 

After this last cycle of this, i slept wellbut woke upfeeling horrible. A queasy feeling in my stomach, a fuzzing feeling in my head, then increased anxiety. I know i need to just suck it up and push through but i keep giving in once the anxiety hits. Are there any things to help with these symptoms? Mostly the queasines and fuzzy head feeling. 

I know I kind of rambled. I guess im just reaching out for support. No one in my life knows about this. Its affecting my marriage especially the lack of libido.

Good luck and god-speed. Quitting is doable , just be prepared for a mental battle. I personally had to give my debit card to my g/f bc I knew what would happen. If you’re looking for a guide to quit my suggestion would be to run or do cardio. Get melatonin, Benadryl, Valerian root, whatever will put you to sleep. Stay busy during the day and keep reminding yourself of anything that will motivate you. My motivation was and is, I have a daughter due in December. My funds would be low by end of pay period and wanted out of that cycle as well. What I’m saying is easier said than done but I promise each day gets a little better.

A little background- I’ve been a kratom user for around 4 years. Hit it hard at first (kilos from SE Asia hard) and have just kind of...glided since. I’ve had some time completely off, but it hasn’t stuck. I’m not even sure why. This last time I was “done for good” I made it the longest I ever had, from Christmas til the day Trump announced the travel ban to/from Europe and my whole family was in Austria...I panicked and caved. Since then I’ve had a week here and there, my withdrawals sometimes are awful and sometimes not, but even having 4 days of uncontrollable emotions and physical agony won’t stop me from going back, even a few days after the withdrawals stop.

So my question is, once you get past the withdrawals, what helps you STAY off? For me the fear of withdrawals doesn’t do it (I feel sort of like I deserve the suffering of I slip up I guess), the money hasn’t been a big enough issue to stop (I struggle with eating so...sometimes I’d just rather buy kratom than food...), and I’ve never felt that great when I’m off it. Just kind of, complacent either way. 

I don’t want to be addicted to a substance anymore, and money is bound to be an issue sooner than later, or at least I’d rather be saving what I’m spending. I don’t even feel high anymore, just less agitated. I see a psychiatrist and they know about my use of kratom, and we are thinking about using naltrexone to help me stay off, but I need *at least* seven days, I really want 14 just in case, to avoid precipitated withdrawal (been there, done that, I don’t have myself enough to do that again, though I did do it once on purpose. Jesus.) 

Ok- so yeah, that’s my question. What keeps you going? Thanks in advance.",4,0

First off I am a heavy Kratom user but every 3 or 4 months I like to take a few weeks (or more) off to reset my tolerance. The following is my experience with both methods.

Trigger Warning: Mention of Cannabis and Phenibut/Baclofen

I don’t believe in the AA or NA mantra of all or nothing, it’s a mind game and if you believe that “one is too many and 1000 is never enough” then you will always be a slave to your “addiction” (in my opinion)

Cold Turkey - Tried this once, will never do it again. My body/mind went into a state of distress that made it impossible to sleep. SLEEP IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO REPAIR NEUROLOGICAL PATHWAYS. Without sleeping I was stuck in this state for a week, I had to take a week off work because I couldn’t function. 
The second week was extreme lethargy and lack of motivation. I was able to work the second week but I would say that it took 2 full weeks of recovery this way 


Taper : I go this way - cut my dose in half for 3 days (I get to the point that I’m getting sneeze attacks which is a sign of Kratom withdrawal, but I’m very careful that my body doesn’t get into a state of distress mentioned above), then again in half for the next 3 days, then off. I always time it so that Saturday is my first day completely off, and rely heavily on Cannabis edibles, Kava and Phenibut to get me through the weekend). Note: Phenibut is very addictive in and of itself, you can’t use it more than 2 days in a row or more than 2 times a week. It’s better to use Baclofen if you can get it, it doesn’t build up a tolerance like Phenibut but if you’re struggling with addiction it’s best to leave this alone.
I am very lethargic and unmotivated for the “taper down” week but I am able to function and go to work.

Conclusion: I much prefer the taper method as the length of recovery time is much shorter due to the ability to sleep

215,2020-07-19 12:09:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hu2y5t/dragging_on/,Dragging on.,"Well, I was managing to get by with using extract around once a week. Had some mild withdrawal but it would dissipate in 2-3 days and was barely noticeable if I was active or working. Convinced myself it was fine, as addicts often do. Until I caught covid. The stress of that led to me using to avoid panic attacks and worrying about needing to go to the hospital or whatever. I used extract for 5 days straight, in increasing doses of once per day. I knew it was going to be rough and also that I had to stop completely after that week binge, and after covid subsided.  


And so I set out to do so, went the first 4 days without anything and was actually feeling pretty good by the final day, and because i'm fucking stupid, decided to pick up extract (one capsule, one time) figuring that it would only set me back a day or so. Did it, and jumped right back into being motivated for the withdrawal. 5 days this time of nothing, and somehow was still feeling like I was on the very first day. It never got worse, but it never got better either. Couldn't sleep, RLS, etc. Felt like this one capsule extended this situation by 2x. On that 5th day, this time less being stupid and more just because I felt I couldn't take it, I did the same again, and yet again, a week has gone by and I still feel mildly fucked.   


I've withdrawn from 80gpd and had less difficulty. This is significantly more mild pain & discomfort wise, but I can't find any improvement happening. When I quit 80gpd the first 3-4 days were hell, but it immediately ramped down after that. Let this be a warning if anyone is wondering how many days back a single dose can set you, I suspect, for extracts at least, it's restarting the entire thing each time you do this.   


I go back to work tomorrow and i'm pretty worried. Really hoping I can sleep tonight and wake up feeling somewhat ok. Also, please don't suggest switching to plain leaf for a taper. I can't control myself with large amounts of kratom nearby. Only reason i'm able to go 5 days or so in attempts to quit is that extract is too expensive to keep a stock of it at home, so if i'm going to cave, it requires driving 20 minutes to the store. If i'm going to cave with plain leaf, it would just involve going to my kitchen cabinet.   


So yeah, i've been experiencing (mild) acutes for almost 15 days now. It fucking sucks, don't give yourself that 'one day' to get sleep and relax. With extracts, it'll reset the entire process.",1,2

The first 2 days of CT weren’t too horrible compared to the last time I went CT (2.5 years ago, was clean for 6 months or so). I left my apartment the day before CT day 1 to stay with my dad as he knows what this has done to me and wants to help. He’s been proactive in asking how I am and how he can help, it’s been a true blessing. 

I’ve gotten a total of 3 hours of sleep the last 2 days and the anxiety has been almost unbearable. I think I ruined my relationship with my girlfriend yesterday due to overthinking, panicking and jumping to conclusions.. I am so disappointed in myself. If anyone is reading this and doesn’t believe what others are saying about W/D anxiety, it’s very real and feels as though your world is collapsing - be ready for this. 

I’m proud of myself though. The night before day 1 I gave my dad the rest of my bag and told him to throw it away or hide it, I don’t know and don’t care what he did with it. I found a small amount in my bag last night and was going to take it because I was so upset about the situation with my girlfriend... I threw that crap in the toilet and flushed it.

I am beyond grateful to have escaped this drug finally.  I have broken out in sweating just a few time in the past few days, but the fact that I am not sweating to death and having those hot flashes makes me so happy. 

I've also noticed I've only sneezed maybe 5-10 times.  I remember when I went cold turkey I sneezed non-stop for at least maybe a week.  The taper definitely made the acutes less than CT, but it was just 34 days of pure detox which was rough.

Anyhow, this past week I've done exceptionally well.  I've ran 6-7 miles everyday.  I've biked.  I had two massages.  I drank lots of water.  I've embarked back on my plant diet (goal to go vegan again), I've taken some vitamins and a couple supplements (5htp, ashwanda, and black seed oil) and all I know is I feel better than ever.  

I was VERY letharigic and fatigued after the acutes, but I still forced myself to run in 90+ degree heat in the middle of the day which I feel liked helped me rid myself of a lot of toxins via sweating.  I just can't tell you how relieved I am this journey is finally over and I'm on the other side.

Thank you all for your support, advice, and encouragement to get off this drug.  I am determined to not ever go back on this or anything else for that matter.  I am enjoying the clarity, sleep, and positive side effects of sober living again.

Bless you all and may you be free of this drug right along with me moving forward.

Also my sleep issues last night were horrible but I got 6 hours but I hot and cold then restless arms (I don’t get restless legs). Hopefully things start looking up my anger is getting out of hand and I’m extremely irritable. Also I can’t seem to be happy. Anyways I hope everyone is doing good.

I've been taking Kratom for over a year now and on the 9th I suffered a serious panic attack 20 minutes after dosing what most would consider a heavy dose (roughly 2 tablespoons and prior for a four hour period I'd dosed 4-6 times with roughly a tablespoon each time)  
I decided to taper for the last 10 days but I noticed when I take any amount of Kratom I get a light headed feeling when getting up and my heart flutters and feels like it's going to fall out of my chest, if that makes sense  
I started doing research, kept getting told by people online it was an overdose then it couldn't have been and had to be a panic attack (I'm sure it was) but now I'm looking into the effects that Kratom has on the heart in long term users and I seen a few death reports of cardiac arrest  
I decided today, after dosing 1tsp this morning that it's time for me to stop once and for all  
Yesterday I was clean all day and hadn't felt any symptoms really regarding my heart or feeling light headed / dizzy  
But just taking that 1 tsp today has caused my heart to flutter and feel funny  


I did go to the hospital on the 13th and had labs, xray, EKG, urine tests ran and all came back okay  
I didn't explain to the doctor I used Kratom though so I thought maybe they missed something from my lack of sharing, Idk  
The anxiety I've had for the past 10 days has been unbearable and panic inducing at times, getting the overwhelming sense of doom and losing all hope of recovering from my abuse on the substance  
(Hypochondriac as well so now I'm convinced even stopping isn't going to let me go back to being normal and no matter what I'm going to feel these heart feelings and anxiety for the rest of my life, I know that's intense but that's the severity of my anxiety)   


I plan to go outside and open my half kilo and dump it in the yard so I can't give into the urges again and make the same stupid decision I have been for the last few days without realizing all these negative affects have been from my substance abuse",9,0

Last year this time I was on an epic backpacking trip that should have brought tears of joy due to  the beauty but I sat there indifferent?

Used to only use 1-2  doses at night to settle down. Originally it was 2-3 nights a week but eventually became nightly. Been in a deep depression for 4 years while also dealing with a lot of terrible anxiety and kratom really helped me through all of it. I made the mistake of starting to dose in the morning and throughout the day when the holidays came around about a year ago while I was also looking for a job and dealing with a lot of anxiety and personal issues at the time, so I was extremely stressed. Ended up getting a job moving a lot of heavy boxes and was careless and ended up fucking my back up pretty bad. That's when I started using really heavily. Kratom was the only thing that relieved my back pain and not only treated my depression and anxiety, but made me my old self again. However, I started noticing that my hair was beginning to thin. I was in denial for a while, but eventually came to terms with it. I knew I was at the age where that can start for a lot of men, so I went to my doctor and got prescribed finasteride, started using minoxidil daily, taking biotin daily, and also using a shampoo and conditioner for hairloss. However, as time went on, I was still losing more and more hair. And I had heard from some people that kratom could cause hairloss, but wasn't sure what to think. And eventually I realized that the hairloss began/coincided with when I started using daily and heavily. I looked more into the hairloss issue and saw people's posts with before and after pictures after quitting kratom and realized that it was probably the kratom. I've been trying to taper for awhile now with little success. I've had a really weird and fucked up life and endured a lot of trauma as a child and have had a really rough time in life in general, especially these last few years. However, I'm happy to say that I am no longer depressed and have been working out, eating good, meditating, and generally taking much better care of myself. I'm also finally seeking treatment for my back pain and seeing a chiropracter 2x a week. I still deal with a lot of anxiety, but am in therapy and have been making a lot of progress.  I'm about to move out of my dad's apartment finally in about two weeks and am ready to really start my life in a big way. I did a lot of writing and creative stuff during my depression and had to really truly find myself to bring myself out of that shit, and I'm finally feeling ready to start putting myself out there. And I'm also starting to look for a new job. I need the hairloss to stop because it is really hurting my confidence and is the last thing I need and at a time when I'm finally starting to do good again and after all I've been through these last few years. I need to stop the kratom, but can't afford to go through the WD's and PAWS at a time like this because I need to be my best self right now. So that's why I started looking into alternatives and looked into the possibility of suboxone. Luckily, I have a really good pain management doctor who also really helped through a nerve pain issue I was really struggling with. I talked to him about my issue and he said he could prescribe me suboxone to get off kratom, but he said I have to go three days without the kratom and and come into his office the morning after the third day to take the first dose of suboxone there. But I'm still at a very high dose and live in a small apartment with my dad who doesn't know about my addiction and also really need to be getting shit together to move out. I've felt the WD's before, so I know what they are like, and really don't want my dad to see me like that. So I'm just wondering if anybody can tell me if it's really necessary to go through the WD's for those three days before taking the suboxone. I thought perhaps that after 24 hours or so when the WD's start, I could take the suboxone to relieve the WD's and begin a loong slow taper of suboxone over time and eventually get off that when I'm ready. Honestly, he's a really great doctor but he doesn't know much about kratom (which he specifically said a while back when I told him I was using it a bit) and seems to be treating the situation as if I'm getting off something else. I'm trying to do a fast taper rn and preparing myself with all sorts of shit to aid me through some withdrawals, but I was just wondering if anyone can tell me if it's really necessary to go through 3 days of withdrawals before I take the suboxone?

More info: I'm also 8 days into phenibut withdrawal after 5 months of daily use (I know, I'm an idiot). Began with a package delivery issue and just decided to go through it since I was already into the worst of it. Started at 2.5 grams a day and was taking 5 grams a day the last week and a half or so before I stopped, but was at 3-3.5 grams a day most of the time. However, I'm prescribed pregabalin for nerve pain and take it daily (and really do need it), so I think that made the WD's much easier than they usually are. I can't tell anymore if some of my symptoms now are from phenibut WD or tapering off the kratom. It seems really rough going from one WD to another, but I feel like it all kinda needs to happen. 

I've heard pregabalin can aid with kratom withdrawal as well, but I really don't want to mess with my tolerance. Going to try to stick to my normal dose, but may perhaps bump it up a couple times if it gets really bad. I got a whole arsenal of other shit to help with withdrawal (much of which I already had on hand) and would list all of it rn, but am in a bit of a rush at the moment and just wanted to add this in.

I was wondering if anybody could tell me if taking pregabalin daily will help with kratom or phenibut PAWS?

 I would think it would help a bit with the phenibut paws, but not sure about kratom. I'm going to make a post over on r/quittingphenibut as well to get some opinions there. I kinda jumped up my kratom dose even more to help me through those WD's and was taking like 10 grams per dose a lot of the time (at night especially). I think I may be through the phenibut WD's, or mostly at least. It was suprisingly not too bad, but I had shit to help including some low dose diazepam as well",2,0

PAWS/dealing with my anxiety/depression after the fact was the worst. i started abusing benzos & drinking tons of alcohol on & off because i just felt awful about myself all the time.. which then led to a really bad downward spiral.

i started abusing opium thru poppy seed tea.. the high was amazing & lasted all day & made me a better person, i started making music again & gained a following & even started making money from my music. fast forward, i knew this would happen eventually but, the high stopped & was basically using it to feel not sick. back to square one.

after trying to quit PST multiple times & failing, i said fuck it & decided to switch to back to kratom & taper from that. long story short, when i quit the first time.. i didn't start getting the real bad physical symptoms until 24-48hrs after dosing, which i basically got rid of with smoking weed.. now, i start getting the physical symptoms anywhere from 4-8hrs. & by 12-24 i'm in full blown agony, all the shitty symptoms but the inability to regulate my body temp. (hot/cold sweats, really bad flu like symptoms) is THE WORST for me.

\------

alright, enough rambling. i use about 15-28 grams a day, but every time i taper i always backslide & ""get high"" AKA feel good for an hr & then wanna take more knowing it'll do nothing. my main thing is, if i can barely make it to the 24hr period, how can i shake this shit? i'm also addicted to benzos, currently tapering with help from a doctor using Ashton Manual, but that's another story.

what i'm planning to do..

\- taper with this last 100gs & then quit when i run out

\- use supplements, forsure using: Black Seed Oil, Megadosing Vit. C, L-Theanine, Magnesium, Valerian Root, Weed.

\- force myself to be active & socialize

\- eat better

&#x200B;

i have 2 questions though

are there any other supplements i should get? i heard Black Seed Oil  & Megadosing Vit. C are really promising.

& what should i expect for the withdrawals, i mean i can barely get past 24hrs, & the worst is usually 4-7 days. i'm sure the reason why the withdrawals are so bad now, is due to the kindling effect AKA the more you withdrawal, the worse it gets.

i'm hoping what i'm planning to do, will make this quit doable.. but any advice would be awesome.

Dont be discouraged by posts about people feeling great after a week or two. Everybody's brain chemistry is different, and it can be very frustrating when youre doing all the right things(diet, exercise, meditation) and still feel like shit.

That being said, if you dont have your diet, exercise, sleep in order, youre really shooting yourself in the foot. In fact, healing goes beyond that, you shouldn't be browsing your phone for hours either or doing activities that are constantly giving you dopamine hits. I know this is huge for kratom users especially, since the boredom and PAWS symptoms leave us craving stimulation due to all the alkaloids in kratom and their effect on the brain.

Word of advice, do not use crutch substances if you can help it. I'm not going to name them for that reason. Youre better of sticking it out for a couple weeks vs trying to feel normal by self medicating in the process and prolonging your healing.

After reading various horror stories about the kratom withdraw I was quite scared for what to expect.. Have been using for over a year now, didnt really weigh my doses but i guess about 50 gpd, some days less, some days more. 

I have a history of depression and was on meds for this until 6 years back, then I studied and traveled abroad a lot and started smoking weed. These years were my happy ones, I discovered making music and singing and painted more, had adventures and met many new and interesting people. Bought a van with my friend and traveled around north America, living the dream...... and got into kratom.

It's funny that now I'm off kratom, I suddenly see it brought me nothing but good, the bad times started the moment I used it, while on Kratom I never thought about this being the direct cause? Things got out of hand and I'm back in Europe with my family, not much contact with friends, depressed, anxious, lonely, sad, angry, irritatible (so bad!!). Wondering if I'd ever feel like my 'fun old self' back, what happened. I even stopped smoking weed because it made me sooo anxious. Then I started doing some research on Kratom addiction and decided I had to quit, just to see what would happen.

It's been only 3 days and I already feel SO much better mentally, my head is still a bit foggy but the emotions, the feelings are THERE! I do not feel absolutely numb or terrible. Feelings of nostalgia, enthusiasm about exploring the world, motivation to expres myself again. Also a bit emotional, but in a good way. Happy tears I guess. 
My thoughts are more quiet, I smoked some weed in the evenings to help me sleep and NO sign of anxiety, no racing, crazy or depressing thoughts. More a clear focus and I felt so inspired to make music that I grabbed my guitar played and sang for 2 hours straight. That didnt happen for about half a year and it's like something came back to me, the joy and freedom that I'd lost for so long.

I know that some is probably yet to come, but this mental change of just feeling not feeling absolutely horrible all the time is showing me that it's worth it. 

Also, I'm mid 20 and eat plant based, drink lots of home made vegetable juice, take cdb oil, extra vitamins and pratice yoga and mindfulness (while on kratom not half as much). Take care of that mind and body to heal :) 

I just hope that this positive story between the horror ones are helping some people make the decision to quit, don't let the (temporarily) tough stuff stop you because in the end things can only get better!",23,0

246,2020-07-17 02:21:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hsqnof/just_my_experience_on_drinkingtriggers_during/,Just my experience on drinking/triggers during late paws and on.,"These are just things I do to help me avoid triggers.

Drinking, In my opinion I'd always take an amino acid 200mg NAC 30 minutes before beers and it can mitigate if not completely eliminate the hangover trigger as long as I remain an occasional drinker.  I Will also expel heavy metals and toxins and I will be stinky and clear headed.  I would never have drank during acute phase however.  And I don't take more in a plan to drink a ton, everything has side effects in excess. And that is just my opinion, I don't know if NAC will work for everybody?

Caffeine, In my opinion I'd only have black coffee in the morning, but not the afternoon.  Doesn't matter how foggy I get later.  I also avoid decaffeinated beverages that have been sweetened with aspartame such as di#t c%ke.  It is a STRONG alkaloid and kratom is an alkaloid, I am always trying to feel better but this compound depletes calcium, dissolves the back of my bottom front teeth and keeps me at the wrong PH to have a clear head and feel good. And SURPRISE, when I cut it out, after going to the dentist a month ago MY BLURRY KRATOM VISION WENT AWAY, and I cant even remember when I quit, was several months ago.  The vision thing stayed and made me miserable looking at small font. I don't know if this applies to anyone but it may help someone?

Supplements, In my opinion the only supplement I need as someone who fights depression, ADD, and a severely bulging lower disk with diet, exercise, and a goofy inversion table, is good nutrition and a high quality occasional probiotic.  My probiotic for some reason makes me feel jolly and somehow staves off my down days quite a bit.  If I work too hard I chug a gross chocolate protein shake for recovery so I don't feel aches.  In my opinion after riding the wagon of wacky herbs and health food store gimmicks, the buzz I always wanted off of kratom was actually just a clear head and vitality, better than caffeine, and nothing I ever took came without drawbacks.  I eat enough sushi, I get really nasty burps off of fish oil and I am very romantic with wifers these days so enough of that. And I'm tired of buying the snake oil.  I do however take vitamin c as I only grow vegetables out back, and in quarantine I've just been ordering most of my food drop off and I can't deal with someone else eyeballing my fruit freshness.

Meds, I let the dentist go crazy with the numb needle but I don't take the various pain pills that he prescribes.  I just tell the pharmacy that I don't want them.  I don't tell my dentist though, I don't really wan't him thinking about me like that, but after having trying a regular nootropic adrafinil a while back, I cant even remember what opiods feel like, so I never want to try them again.  I'm not saying that would work for anybody but there is an interesting paper I read while having a craving day when I had an important meeting I did not want speak at.  I'll share but it's just some research.  Maybe I just convinced myself that what I was reading was real and it worked?  For me it was one hell of a placebo effect if that was the case. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939923/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939923/) It also cut my caffeine tolerance in half forever and it has been quite a while, but that's just me, I could be crazy but crazy feels pretty darn good these days!

This is all just what helps me a great deal, it may not apply to anyone, it's all just my opinion.  I don't recommend anybody live by any lifestyle but their own.  Do what works for you in staying strong. And don't skip leg day.",2,1

Things got way better around day 21, the PAWS anxiety let up, I was feeling very hopeful. However on the 4th of July I drank ALOT and feel like I set myself back bigtime, and ever since that day I have had residual anxiety and mood swings. It felt like a reset of my withdrawal, like some kindling effect, but alcohol and kratom dont even work on the same receptors right? Makes no sense. 

Really regret getting super drunk that night because before that it seemed the anxiety, brain fog and depression had all but disappeared.

It should also be noted that I have a panic disorder and am on Lexapro 10mg, have been for 5 years. Perhaps my brain is still trying to equalize and drinking just sort of threw it off while it was trying to heal",11,0

I'm going to go to the local vocational school in my small town and take the maintenance/electrical courses offered and follow in the footsteps of my ole man (my papaw, that's the only father I ever had). It may not be luxurious, but it certainly provided me with many things growing up that other kids didn't have. Like a brand new truck, off the lot when I was 14, a brand new motorcycle for graduation, a brand new Camaro off the lot, you know, things I shouldn't have been provided with but was. On the bright side, I can use that training most anywhere I decide to take it in any place in our country, and it pays at the least decent money, enough to provide for a future family, which I hope to have. I should be able to wrap this up right before my 30th birthday, and continue pressing on. My sleep is stabilizing more and more, sneezing is, might I say the same or getting a little worse?

I'm not sure my post will bee helpful or supportive, but maybe someone else will feel less alone by reading one extra commentary on 'you're not alone with sleep issues'.    I have not been using kratom all that long.   Had off an on periods since last July -- usually 3 months at a time up to 16GPD (8g twice per day).   Had a total of 3 withdrawals, this last one 18 days ago being my 3rd -- each one gets **PROGRESSIVELY WORSE**.     Par for the course as with opiates.

Why did I stop?   Well, I was getting weird intra-dose withdrawals and temperature regulation issues that were horrible and I was also anticipating the end-game of this shit which is never pretty -- wanted to cut my loses before the months turned to years.     I simply wanted OUT of being dependent on something like this.    I always get this way.   Many years ago I tried suboxone for an opiate habit I developed and after one month in  I just hated the thought of being a slave to something like the orange pill -- so I got off -- it wasn't pleasant.    

Anyway, I didn't find the acute Kratom withdrawals any worse or even close to that of  Vicodin, Methadone, Oxy or Suboxone EXCEPT in two regards;   NO SLEEP and Anhedonia.    Kratom simply rapes your brain with regard to sleep with the precision of a  massive benzo-addiction.  You'd think I was coming off a year long Klonopin habit.     

In 18 days I can count two where I slept 'well'  -- 6 solid hours (HUGE I know) is a dream come true, but this only happens after **complete exhaustion and utter defeat** \-- pounding the bed in anguish with both fists.   It's like I'm on  a see-saw where I can't sleep, become completely exhausted, then sleep a bit the next day  -- just a BIT-- rinse and repeat.   Then there's the depression the next day from not sleeping -- very real.    Then there is the fear of the bed and the dread of trying to sleep again. 

My options early on were forced running during the day -- just 3.5 miles followed by two 2 mile walks.   This worked.   I was recently diagnosed with a hernia so the runs can't be done anymore.    I still walk, but it's not as exhausting as running.   Went for a 16 mile bike ride -- still not as tiring as running -- even with hills.     Last night I slept well without doing \*any\* exercise the same day -- I didn't sleep the ENTIRE night before so I was exhausted.     Anyway, I've tried everything -- all the comfort meds; melatonin, clonidine, doxylamine (unisom), magnesium, etc.    sometimes they help, sometimes they don't and hangovers are real from some of these (clonidine and doxylamine in particular).  

Let me get back to last nights sleep and I'll follow this up if it holds up.   I had some CBD and Hemp oil (full spectrum) that I tossed because 'hey, I'm sober now and although I don't do 12 step anymore I do have an unreasonably  militant attitude toward any substance (very confusing!)   -- can't be doing anything right?   Well, I was so desperate yesterday I would have done anything -- I even thought of Kratom, but that sounded **in-fucking-sane** to me.   So, I dug out the CBD and Hemp oil, took two generous doses one in the afternoon and one at night. Well, last night I  \*loved\* my sleep -- I can't describe it, I felt relaxed getting into bed -- NO racing brain nothing -- my body was relaxed.   Placebo?   I don't know.   I've always thought the CBD thing was absolute bullshit -- maybe not.  

Sorry for long rambling post.   Thanks everybody I wish you ALL luck  and my heart goes out to all of you, I feel your pain, but we can get through this.  If I have continued success with CBD / Hemp oil I'll follow up.

On the last episode of ""oh god, is this my life"" I gave my usage history (200gpd and 5 years) and general thoughts so far.

Twenty one is a hallowed number, even if not necessarily holy to me, as a step in the fibonacci sequence which speaks of ratios and spirals. This is fitting as I've been considering ratios and spirals much this week. 

Ratios haunt me and comfort me simultaneously, but also give me pause. I cut my peak dosage by half twice, with some time in between, before I went cold turkey. This gave me as much hope as it did anxiety, because I successfully held to my standards but I was hesitant to do so for reasons that I deeply understood but didn't want to acknowledge. But I am also given a sense of disquiet when I overly dwell on this; the small, ophidian voice in my mind whispering a single word to me when I feel like I cannot continue further. ""Moderation...,"" it hisses softly, saccharine, and maybe even kindly in its own way, because it understands me in a way that no one else can. It rides with me in this malfunctioning flesh that I have been gifted, a boon that cuts like razor wire whenever I grasp it but can't reject without great offense. I've heard it speak before and it never lies to me, but may tell a truth that I lack strength enough to abide. My usage was ridiculous and I was ignorant of danger. Could I not put those things in check and balance the peril with the benefit? Can one have a thing and not consume it as well? Or let it consume you? I don't know but I feel the urge to find out, even with the wisdom to know that some doors lock behind you once you pass through.

I feel like I'm spiraling either up or down, although it could be either depending upon time and perspective (or both, or neither, if we wanted to get paralytic in philosophizing). I feel like I have made some significant progress in pursuit of my goal, which admittedly is ill-defined because I wasn't forced into this, but I have also been plagued by myriad defeats. My blade is notched, my shield is scarred and heavy this week, and I am weary. I have had insurmountable difficulties this week just attempting to maintain the quality my life and work because of the return of the things that led me here, and the reemergence of old and current pain is terrible if not  intolerable. Things felt so much more simple before this, but I find that choices are difficult to make and commit to when contrasted to the set path of a comfortable chain, although maybe I was just numb to it previously. I adored the numbness for what it gave me but I resent it for what it took. I wish that I could have the best of both without being cheated of either, but this cannot be. But how many defeats can I justify in the name of one victory? Again, I don't know, but as long as this isn't a pyrrhic struggle I will withhold despair while having the courage to acknowledge fear.

I've made some progress, shaky as it is. I was actually at the head shop where I first discovered kratom the other day on a noble quest for some kava, which has never wronged me, and they had none so they offered me kratom. I thanked them and left empty handed with only an imperceptible hesitation, but I did hesitate. It was a risk and a personal challenge to myself that I met. I was hoping to get something else to temporarily soothe me that wasn't alcohol, because my alcohol consumption has increased by three hundred percent (from nothing ever to occasionally one or two beers), because I had a doctor's appointment the other day and received some unpleasant news. I have an immense amount of distrust and disdain for most doctors, save for the blessed surgeons, but I am at a better point in my life where I can challenge them if they want to play pretend at thinking they are god and do more irreversible damage to me. I gain nothing from pursuing nothing. 

I don't really know what to say beyond that. I've had much suffering because of my reasons for taking kratom coming back and I dread working through them, if they even can be sorted out, but I held the line today and every other day before that. Maybe I just need a more tangible victory this week, or at least a more glorious one than just survival or being content with performing basic self care. Now that the acute withdrawals are done, it is challenging to gauge where I am at in whatever process this is because the battle has changed from external to internal. Our interiors are as vast as a universe, which is shameful that we explore them so infrequently, and we have to pick whether or not we will focus on the suns and galaxies or the yawning maw of the void. 

Thinking back now, I got to spend some time with someone who means very much to me and take part in something that they love to do. I even enjoyed it and maybe that's enough. I just need to hold onto those things when they come. Someone told me once that you can't hold water with either an open hand or a fist, which I think meant that you can't hold onto anything too tightly or loosely without failing. Sometimes I want to completely let go and check out, and sometimes I want to tense up and destroy anything that I can see blocking my path. Maybe choosing the middle path between those is the moderation that I need to focus on and be unconcerned with trying to go back to something destructive.

I'll do my best. That's all I can do.",16,0

What should I expect? Also see post, I'm not sure if I should do this now or later.","So I've been doing this for about 4 months. Started as just a little ""oh this feels good to do every now and then, like drinking,"" and it ended up becoming a habit because I was led to believe it's harmless. Well, for a while now, I've been experiencing worsening depression, extreme agitation, and as of four days ago, persistent sweating and heat flashes.  

I don't know for sure if it \*IS\* the kratom, but I want to to be sure(and to be quite honest I really don't like taking it at all anymore, it's not doing anything good for me anymore and having to sit down and do this stupid shit with the spoon of gross gagging powder sucks), so I'm going to just break the habit.   
  

The agitation and worsening depression I was experiencing way before kratom, and it is in effect even before I take my dose(s) (I add an 's' because sometimes I split the 4g into two 2g ones), and agitation is a side effect of wellbutrin.  

On that note, next week on Tuesday I see a psychiatrist, and I am going to get my medications changed. I'm wondering if it's a good idea to even quit right now because I'm afraid the withdrawal(if there is any from such a low dosage) will somehow influence my behavior or thoughts while speaking to her, or make me appear worse than I actually am. Plus, if I switch medications, I'll be dealing with withdrawal from wellbutrin alongside whatever kratom is going to do.

Really confused on how to go about all of this.  

Like it's not really harming my life, or getting in the way of anything, but the depression does get bad at times and I feel at points like I'm just losing my grip on reality which I really do not like. The uncertainty of it being just caused by the medication I'm on doesn't help.

I feel like I am pretty much over Kratom entirely at this point. Obviously I am aware that I am still an addict, so if I was to take Kratom or any substance for that matter I would probably start to use it regularly, but with that said, I don't feel an urge to use any substances. The thought of getting drunk or having a cigarette for a buzz has crossed my mind plenty of times but I have never given in to those idea. In 2017 when I quit Kratom for the first time (lasted 2 months) I picked up drinking, cigarettes, and high doses of caffeine to help fill the void and make my life less boring.   But this time around I've been very adamant about not replacing one addiction with another, although I am using technology as an escape still (helps keep my mind distracted from reality).

Right now I feel like I am depressed, I am still able to do things, but  everything seems pointless. Even though I am depressed I feel a lot better than I did when I was on Kratom. In the beginning of my journey I told myself that the main thing I was going to focus on after quitting was getting into shape. I believed that a healthy body will create a healthy mind, I think this is true. I have been doing cardio (couch to 5k program) and some light strength training exercises to recondition my body for weight lifting, and I have felt better about myself as a result. I think once I eventually get into more intense exercise ( running longer, more frequently, and lifting weights ) this effect will likely increase even more.  Exercise is the closest thing you can get to a natural high with the lowest risk of crashing. Relationships are very dangerous as they produce highs/lows unpredictably, and people are prone to making mistakes during the lows, even the highs for that matter.

&#x200B;

But as I was saying, right now I feel like i'm depressed, I lost crucial years of my life while on Kratom , I used it from 20-26. Years I should've spent bettering myself, instead I slowly but surely became a shell of my former self and wasted all that time working dead end jobs and spending it on useless stuff I didn't need. I was depressed before I started Kratom, but I feel like my depression is worst now, mainly because of regret, and I don't have as much socialization as I did when I was younger.

The point of my post is this, the quality of our lives is very important, quitting drugs is a good thing, it's a big step in the right direction, but I don't believe you will ever be satisfied unless you are content with your actual life. So I think everyone should strive to make friends, form relationships, pursue passions, try new things, etc..  I know that life will get better for me, from all the research i've done I believe it can take as long as 2 years to completely recover from opiod abuse.  And I do plan on forming new relationships, but right now it's somewhat difficult because of the worlds current state, but for now, I can work on myself physically and get my heart and my brain healthy again.

&#x200B;

In the river of life you're either moving upstream or going downstream, there is no in between. We have to constantly try and better ourselves everyday, even if it's just a little bit. The moment we become complacent is the moment we start to wither away. I hope everyone here sticks to their goals. Don't give up, it will be worth it in the end.",12,0

I honestly felt normal after about 3 solid weeks. I can definitely say I don’t think about Kratom anymore. The only time it crosses my mind is when I drive by the store. By my calculations I have saved about $150 since quitting. Ain’t much but still that’s about a grand a year. 

How I feel-


I think I can honestly say I feel normal. It’s hard to remember exactly what it was like before being on K but as far as I can tell all is back to normal-well, all in my head, the world is definitely not normal right now. Get off guys, it’s great not being dependent on something to feel normal- not counting caffeine.",11,0

I am proud to say I have been 241 days free from the grasp of addiction of kratom.  One thing I have noticed quitting substance abuse of any kind is, quitting the substance is one thing, but the growth and transformation of lifestyle is the biggest change that has to occur. I noticed how quitting addiction was only the beginning, I had to change my daily THINKING, ADDITUDE, BEHAVIOR and BELIEFS.  Using substances was not my problem, it was my solution to my problems and heartache.
My problem is my thinking,attitude and behavior.
I really had to change my identity of who I was and how I believe in myself.  I'll be honest my self esteem and belief in myself went up the ass , I felt worse then I've ever felt before.  Depression for me was a normal thing, until I decided to control what I put into my eyes and ears. I started to listen to positive reinforcement videos, self help and developing a purpose and goal in life. Whenever I watched negative stuff , i felt down and depressed. I promise life in addiction is worse then sober. When you are sober you can actually change the circumstances of your life.

I promise you all, you will be happy naturally,  motivated, excited.  Some days I feel so happy I actually feel the dopamine tingling in my head. You can do it. 
I WAS THE UNFIXABLE. I wanted to end my life. I couldn't stop the vicious cycle. I want to cry writing this because I cannot believe i am sober and enjoying life. 
If I did it anybody can I promise you with my life.
YOU CAN DO IT.",74,0

A few nights ago i had my 4th seizure. Ive been taking kratom since 2014 and i had my 1st seizure in 2015, 2nd one in 2016 and 3rd one in 2017. During the time of my first 3 seizures i was taking a lot of drugs. Cocaine, weed, painkillers, benzodiazepines, and a lot of alcohol. After my 3rd seizure i went to see a neurologists and after many tests they said nothing was wrong with me and thought the seizures were a result of taking all of those drugs so in october of 2018 i quit everything with the exception of kratom. 3 nights ago i woke up to my roomate standing over me and on the phone with 911, i had my 4th seizure and had nothing in me but kratom. Scary shit. Im now thinking all 4 of my seizures were directly related to kratom. I am now in the procoss of tapering down from 70gpd (yes i know, a fuckin lot of kratom in one day) to 20gpd the last 3 days. I basically just want to inform the ones on here who are thinking about quitting kratom that this plant can do bad things with long term use.

I was using it for major depressive disorder which also helped with the fatigue. My use was no where near some of the stories here, but I knew deep down that this wasn't going to be the cure or a long term fix. What I can say is for me that once I taperd and stopped, it was like the depression had been bottled up for the entire time and came back with a vengeance,  almost like it was trying to catch up for lost time. During this time, seeing my psychiatric doctor we ventured into a medication that is a mood stabilizer and not as SSRI or other common antidepressants,  which I had all tried before kratom and they didn't work for me. Once I was at the therapeutic dose I could tell that it was helping pull me out of the pool of shit I had bottled up and ignored. I also started TMS therapy to deal with the depression,  because there is and was no way I was going to deal with this the rest of my life. There are some other things I attribute to helping me personally:

WATER: seems like a no brainer right. But I found that I was always almost chronically dehydrated which worsened the fatigue x 1000. I did drink water like most but no where near where I should be. I started to force myself to drink 1 gallon a day and that made a huge difference in my mood and energy.  

WIM HOF: others have talked about him and his techniques on this sub before. I started doing his breathing technique and cold emerson therapy and it has been really helpful and positive.  He has a phone app you can download,  track your progress and learn new things and techniques. 

Others have said it better then I can on here about the positives of supplements,  excercise and so on. The only thing I can add is the use of lions mane and supplemental mushrooms that support your immune system, there is one company that mixes most of the beneficial one that you can mix into water and drink that I found gave me energy and some positive vibes. As well as bone broth to help heal my gut because your gut plays a vital roll in your health and overall wellbeing.  

I guess what I am trying to say and this is just my opinion, is that if you are using it for mood conditions and come off, be prepared to hit a fucking wall hard. But seeking help instead of moving on to the next substance is vital. Antidepressants get a bad rap, but they do help a lot of people and can help with the underlying issues coming off kratom in my experience. It may take a bit of trial and error but you can see through clear eyes again. Also for me, getting a grip on the main issues allows me some comfort knowing that kratom is always there and the pressure is a bit lighter to know that maybe someday I can use it on a Saturday night to have some fun instead of booze, but not rely on it as the main medication, I don't plan on it but knowing that and not demonizing any substance because it never made me do it , actually takes the pressure off and makes me want it even less which may sound weird but thats just me.

In the end and sorry for the long post, hope all of you are well and strong with whatever way you turn in your journey regardless of how many times you relapse, tomorrow is a new day.

7 year user rotating strains to prevent tolerance, that what I was told. Anyway, became dependent on kratom and found out it's a bitch to stop. Also told it takes just a week to clear yourself of kratom if you been rotating. That was bullshit.

So was this rotating strains for tolerance bullshit?

I was also told that stem and vein kratom is the way to go to quit kratom. They say it hits different receptors. I  have a bag but have not used it and am doing a taper for about 7 weeks to reduce withdrawal. 

Is this more bullshit?

Just gonna explain how it all went. I decided to quit because I was going through a very traumatic stressful time and started developing a rare form of OCD that convinced my brain I was gonna die LITERALLY 24/7 and the kratom was making it so so so much worse looking back on it. I’d take the kratom and feel better for about 30 minutes and then feel 10x worse than before I took it. And it was dulling my life a whole lot. And it would end up putting me in withdrawal about 45 mins after I took it and this was only at about 4g 3x per day. I refused to take more than 4g. Anyway. I ended up tapering to about 2g per dose and then just quit and it was so easy and I got nothing but positive returns from it. I used black seed oil, GABA, Ashwaghandha, magnesium, and agmatine to quit and boy did that help. What kept me going was just how much better I felt. I didn’t mind feeling a little bit achy and on edge because I could FEEL life again the magic of life came back. And after abstaining from kratom for a little while and doing some meditation, my OCD was pretty much completely gone. I had conquered it. Literally cured. So I abstained first about 3 months and one day after working and being completely sober I decided to go to a kava bar. It ended up being a bit of a problem because I ended up going there every day for weeks after that. Not this kava bar, unfortunately, serves kratom. Really good kratom. So one day I took some kratom and I kept it as like an occasional thing for awhile but I made the mistake of doing it 3 days in a row and then started getting withdrawals and just kept doing more kratom and now I’m about a month or 2 into this again and my OCD is starting to show again and I just get really sick feeling and paranoid and anxious whenever I take it and now I just see that it’s time to quit NOW 

So that’s what I’m gonna do as soon as I have those supplements again I may taper again idk but wish me luck and good luck to you all

I have constant diarrhea still, which, I usually had even before kratom and which kratom helped to suppress actually. I'm thinking to see a gut doctor this week maybe. Because I've been covering this problem but maybe I have IBS or I don't know? I think it might be at least partially anxiety related anyway.

I had two things (death in family and an ugly breakup) after which I allowed myself to use kratom again and then even more so. But I realised in spring that actually it doesn't help me with anything anymore, it numbs the pain a bit, but I'm just becoming this do-nothing full-of-self-pity person I don't wanna be.

I'm seeing therapy since winter and I'm thinking of joining AN where I live

I'm a student at uni and fund myself from student jobs, and now it's summer, so, I guess my main question today is as I'm having a worse day, is, how do you all balance doing things, but not overwhelming yourself, overstressing about the things 'you're supposed to be doing and delivering', not letting guilt make you idle, but also getting to do some things at least? Do you have like a routine or smth? I wanna study for an exam I'll have but I feel that stressing subconsciously stops me from it these days.

I doubt I would have been able to quit gabapentin weed and alcohol were it not for the fact that I had kratom to “fall back on”.

I never too more than 6gpd and yet I am still having worse withdrawals than some of the people I’ve seen on here who were taking 50gpd. This substance is weird as fuck and I don’t get it. Why do we all have such different experiences with quitting.

Is there anything I can do for the RLS?? I can’t excercise because of my injuries so sitting on the couch with RLS and major body anxiety has been absolutely killing me.

I have also been having bouts of extreme rage and suicidal thoughts that are incredibly intrusive.

It also seems like weed has turned on me because even if I try and smoke CBD flower I start to freak out and the intrusive thoughts get worse. Just a week or so ago I was able to take fat dabs with no problem and now I have a panic attack from one hit, idk what’s going on with me.

Back in April I decided it was finally time to quit (I tried before but it would only last 3 days).

I quit CT (I dramatically reduced my dose for about 5 days before quitting CT). It was absolute hell. The physical WD - achy joints, freezing, sweating, insomnia - were tough. Mental WD was just as bad. I already suffered from anxiety and depression and this amplified it. Random crying outbursts and little to no motivation to do anything. Getting off the couch was an ordeal. I lasted probably 40 days. After day 20 things got way easier and I understood my natural baseline. My fiancé was so proud and happy for me. I also promised her I would never touch it again from the negative ways my PAWS impacted her. (Let’s just say I was less than pleasant).

Well after day 40 I made the mistake of buying more kratom. I have repurchased it 2 more times since then and have been taking it in secret. I have been taking the same amount but not everyday. Still, I’m deciding to stop and I’m on day 2 and those familiar PAWS are back. Luckily this time they are way more manageable but this time I also have to pretend like I’m 100% ok.

This is the only thing I haven’t been honest with my partner about - the fact I have to hide it is enough for me to really see how kratom has its wraps around me.

It’s obviously because I’m taking too much, but the real question, for myself at least, is “why do I continue to do it if the outcome is already set”?

I have chronic pain due to cracked and slipped discs in my spine. I was going through some rough pain about 3 weeks into living at this sober living so I decided to try some kratom. It worked wonderfully. I started using about 6 grams a day. Was getting great effects with every dose. Then it stopped working. Then I upped the dose and it would work sometimes. Then I started buying higher quality kratom off of the internet. I have felt guilty 5 or 6 times and have thrown it all away 5 or 6 times resigning not to use it anymore but yet the next day I find myself coming up with an excuse to go buy more. Now I am having problems breathing and am having major chest pains...and they are scaring me. I started making tea instead of swallowing the powder because I thought maybe I was inhaling the powder on accident...but I'm still having the same problems...since I started using kratom I have stopped working out and I hate that. I'm using like 15 GPD now. Now I feel like I'm even more uncomfortable than before I started using it and I don't know what to do. I can't ask anyone here for help because then I will get kicked out.

I’m only 22 so I haven’t completely destroyed my body but this is a serious problem for me. I ended up leaving my boyfriend and coming to live with my mom. It took me a while to tell her what’s going on with me even though she knew I have a problem. She’s going to help me taper because I have no self control.

304,2020-07-13 19:50:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hqqpq9/day_10_feeling_a_little_better/,Day 10 - Feeling a Little Better,"Today, I was back at work.  I only worked 2 days the previous week and they were super tough.  About 3-4 hours into my shift I would start aching and become extremely tired.  I had zero interest in my work.  In fact, I had zero interest in anything other than lying in bed.  

This weekend, I did just that.  I slept off and on and not well overall.  I took some unisom to help me sleep, but I’ve found that if I don’t take anything it takes me easily 30+ hours before I actually sleep.  Then, it’s kind of weak.  However, I made a little progress today.

When I got home from work, I was exhausted, but overall work wasn’t bad.  It went by much quicker and I only had an hour or 2 where it was misery, the rest was totally doable. Anyways, I decided to lay down and take a nap.  That turned into 4 hours of sleeping.  I woke up actually feeling pretty good.  It was probably the 2nd time since I quit that I actually slept decently and felt good.  My dreams have been very vivid and intense.  I’ve woken up several times and remembered them.  It’s been a long time since that last happened.  It’s been nice!

Since I’ve quit many times before, I know how this can go wrong though.  I get in the habit of sleeping as soon as I get home and then I can’t sleep later that night.  If I actually do stay up and go to bed at a proper time, I have trouble going to sleep or I sleep for only a couple of hours.  It totally sucks.  Week 1 is like you got hit with a sledgehammer and week 2 feels like a series of slow painful needle pricks, it’s better, but sucks in its own way.

I’d like to look at the positive.  First of all, I am saving SO MUCH more money.  It’s insane how I was spending.  I LOVE eating when high on kratom, especially sweets.  I actually gained a lot of weight on it because of how much I was eating.  I would come home, make a nice fancy meal of like steak, potatoes and veggies then eat like 2-3 butterfingers all while drinking craft soda.  That’s nice for once in a while, but when you do it daily for weeks on end, the cost adds up.  Then, I was buying kratom weekly.  If I had to guess, I was spending about $60-80 on kratom, sometimes more.  I also tended to like to cruise Amazon and buy things.  Since I’ve quit, I am maybe spending $60 a week on groceries.  I am eating way less, no soda, no candy and basic meals - nothing fancy.  My appetite is less, but that’s OK.

Secondly, my body and health is improving.  My eyes are no longer red constantly, dull and glazed.  I feel more alert and focused.  I am peeing better.  It seems like when I take kratom peeing was always more difficult.  My skin isn’t as oily and I don’t have breakouts anymore.  My hair is markedly improved.  I also find myself laughing again, I use to find things funny, but they never tickled me.  Now I find myself laughing at things.  I am EXTREMELY thankful the cold and hot flashes have stopped.  Those things make you feel SO bad and sick.  Soon as a wave comes on you just feel disgusted.

Lastly, I feel hopeful.  On kratom, I was content with my rinse and repeat lifestyle.  I wanted to go out and do more things, but I know it would always revolve around kratom.  Now, I know it doesn’t!  I feel hopeful I can become the person I want to be and live the life I want.  There’s a lot I’d like to do in the next 6 months.  I can easily do it all if I just go for it!

There are really 2 concerns out of everything.  First, I feel bad about work.  I’m showing up and doing the absolute minimum, which is more than others, but I’ve always held myself to a higher standard.  I worry my boss is going to spot something and all of a sudden view me differently.  I’ve thought this just about everytime I’ve quit and it never comes to fruition.  In the times that someone has asked if I’m OK, I just tell them I’m going through a phase and they always understand and get it.  Usually within a couple of weeks, I’m back to normal.  But, it always concerns me.

The other concern is permanent damage.  I start worrying about the long terms effects.  I really worry about my liver and mental state.  I’ve done so much kratom that is no longer gives me eye wiggles.  The first year I took it, if I went in excess, I would begin to not be able to see straight, I would basically have eye wiggles and it would take hours to stop.  The fact that it doesn’t do that anymore concerns me.  Also, the fact that this withdrawal hasn’t been as bad as past ones also concerns me.  Maybe it’s because this is the 3rd or 4th time in 2 months I’ve tried to quit.  Most times it would be 4-7 days without and then relapse.  Maybe those few days helped and that’s why this time it’s not as bad.  Regardless, I just want to be back to normal.  I’m just worried I will always feel this way: tired, uninterested and unable to sleep.

I’d love to have all my interests back, be entergetic and sleep great.  I can remember all the times I quit and the insomnia.  It royally sucks.  But, I can remember how after 3 weeks, sleep always came back and by day 30... I was sleeping normal again.  Here’s to making it 10 days and to grinding out another few days and making it to 14!",8,0

For the past few years, I haven't had a regular schedule and would typically take small amounts of kratom several times throughout the day. Even though it's a good idea to wait many hours in between doses, I developed the bad habit of taking small amounts and then periodically boosting every few hours. By 'small amounts,' I mean that I would take approximately 2g every few hours. Not sure what this worked out to as a daily total, but I have been going through about 250 to 350 grams a month, so approximately 10 to 12 grams a day, but this is just ballpark.

A couple weeks ago, I got serious about quitting. I purchased a scale that is accurate to .01 grams and also purchased a few hundred plastic condiment containers (like used for hot sauce) so I can measure out doses at the beginning of the day. I'm now dosing four times a day: upon waking (around 6 or 7 am), at noon, at 5:00 p.m., and shortly before going to sleep (usually around 11:00 p.m.). It is a 50-day tapering schedule, with a .4g reduction every day.

For example, on the first day, I took 4.5g at 7:00 a.m, 4.5g at noon, 4.5g at 5:00 p.m, and 4.5g before bed. On the second day, I took 4.4g at 7:00 a.m., 4.4g at noon, 4.4g at 5:00 p.m., and so on. I'm almost one week into the taper, and today's individual dose is 4.0g. The overall total for today is 16 grams.

This seemed like a very slow taper, so I figured it would be relatively easy to pull off. However, my wife reports that I have been very restless at night. When I wake up in the morning, I'm detecting that classic 'can't get comfortable in my own skin' feeling that I associate with a desire for more kratom. I'm also noticing this feeling throughout the day. For example, I took a dose at noon but noticed this familiar uncomfortable sensation at around 2:00 p.m.

It's the weirdest thing because I wasn't experiencing these things before when I was dosing more haphazardly. Or, perhaps I \*was\* experiencing these things subconsciously and that's why I kept topping up more tiny doses of kratom.

I would be grateful for any advice or suggestions from people who have experience kicking their kratom habit. A few questions:

\+ Is it possible that I'm taking too much kratom before bed? Or, conversely, should I be taking slightly more kratom before bed?

\+ Is there any value in splitting up my nighttime kratom dose so that I take half of it before sleeping and then take the second half when I wake up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night?

\+ Should I be trying to take just three doses a day instead of four doses a day? The kratom tapering chart that I used as a template only suggested three doses, but I went for a four-dose regimen because I had been taking it so regularly throughout the day.

\+ Is it typical for these sorts of symptoms to kick in after the first week of tapering? It seems weird that this didn't start on the second or third day.

It's the worst in the morning where I have heaviness in my chest and keep having to take deep breaths. It also feels like impending dread or doom and makes it very difficult to appreciate anything or focus at work.

I have Propranolol and Ativan. I don't take the Ativan because I don't want to risk it and frankly it hasn't gotten that bad. But the Propranolol seems to really take the edge off and I believe it is safe to take regularly. 

I just want to feel like I used to. I know it will take time, but I would greatly appreciate any reassurance you may have.",2,0

I used to have a problem in my youth with prescription painkillers. I switched to kratom to make the jump back in 2016 and fell to a 50gpd habit, and got off it in 2018. The withdrawals were minor at best having faced H and oxy withdrawal countless times. Fast forward to 2019, I'm sober from most mind altering substances (no painkillers or pills) but some days I cannot move because the pain is so unbearable. I started using kratom again for the pain, fell into using it daily at 18gpd for about 2 months. Decided I didnt want to be committed to anything that downregulates my receptors. I went Cold turkey with only very minor symptoms for 48 hours (90% mental, noticable back pain). I just caved into the pain today and took 12grams. Am I foolish for restarting? I know I mentally can do a few days on few days off. But the fear of WD still looms and I'm just afraid to continue using. Are there any other herbs that you guys can reccomend for pain. And do you think realistically that a chronic pain patient could control their use? Feeling defeated with my pain. And lastly because I dosed 12 grams this morning can I expect my WD symptoms (anxiety, lethargy) to return strong tommorow? Thankyou",2,0

I actually made a post in this group a few weeks after similar to this one except now I have a few more answers. During the weeks after some odd symptoms developed including: facial pain, sleep issues, temperature issues (unable to stand heat), headaches, blurry vision sometimes, tinnitus, odd feelings of pressure in my head, constant brain fog and inability to concentrate to the point of speaking being affected in a minor sense, slight balance issues, and just a general feeling of unwell sometimes to the point of inducing panic attacks. I’m sure I’m leaving out some symptoms as well as there were a ton and came at different times. Some have subsided, some are still here, the worst to this day is the brain fog, lack of energy some days and just an underlying feeling of being unwell. Now when I first made a post here I was looking to see if anyone experienced anything similar, some said yes but a lot of the responses were “this isn’t kratom man go get checked out”. And that’s exactly what I did, and not only checked out but thoroughly had my body tested in almost every sense. I had tons of bloodwork, a literal mri done on my brain and spine (hard to get here in Canada), heart tests, neurological tests, my eyes checked extensively and a few other things. All came back normal. I was literally convinced I had brain cancer or multiple sclerosis so I was beyond ecstatic when my brain and mri test came back all clear. But that good feeling has worn off and now I’m back to wondering what the hell is going on. I cannot fathom being four months out from quitting and still feeling this way, almost to the point of stopping me from living my life normally. My only logical explanation now is that this drug has altered my brain chemistry in some long lasting way (hopefully not forever) but that is not something that can easily be tested for. My family doctor says all or most of the symptoms I’ve felt would be indicative of some “brain or spinal pathology” but sure enough everything is healthy and normal there. I’m so lost and confused and I wouldn’t wish this experience on my worst enemy, but maybe if someone is experiencing something similar and reads this it may provide some comfort. Because a month ago I was literally convinced my life would be ending soon or I had some life changing disease, and as of right now the medical community would consider me a perfectly healthy individual based on the extensive testing I’ve had done. I’m not even sure why I made another post here, maybe just to vent and connect with some of you but damn I can’t believe I’m still feeling this way after this long, and I hope I get some answers or relief soon but I’m not optimistic as it’s been 4 months.

Took the first 8 days off of work and spent time with family and friends and it really took my mind of things and helped a lot. (So if you have the chance to do so I suggest this). Friday I started back at work and work SUCKS without a crutch I’ve been at this job for 6 years and was on suboxone for 3 and kratom for the other 3. My biggest issue honestly is just being able to sit and relax, there’s a lot of downtime so in a 12 hour shift I’m sitting around for a good 8-9 hours and ugh man relaxing is hard. And not even just at work; at home I really enjoy watching series and movies and playing video games and I have really been struggling sitting there for very long without getting restless. 

But all things aside I’m doing fine, I promise you all it’s doable. I suggest staying busy because it keeps your mind of things ALOT. The first week sleeping is really tough, I probably got no more then 3 hours and woke up constantly. But that is getting a little better. My stomach is feeling a lot better it was a mess for the first week and had no appetite but I’m eating pretty good now. Still diarrhea pretty much always lol but what can ya expect after taking something that makes ya constipated for so long. 

I’m doing a lot of rambling here but anyone looking for hope just know you WILL be okay you can do this. My symptoms are very minor by now and just stuff I have to learn to deal with because we are humans not robots ruled by the green dust. I also want to suggest to not fill your void with another substance because we are all addicts here and we always seek out the easy way. Just like I did with kratom after getting off suboxone, which was just another demon. My mom actually offered me some Xanax to sleep when I was over there and I contemplated it but I know me and benzos should definitely be a nono so I didn’t. I did go to the doctor and told her everything that was going on and she prescribed me trazodone which is a very minor sleep/antidepressant drug and it’s helped a bit. I also think I will try some kind of anxiety med when I go back for the follow up appointment that’s not a benzo, anxiety issues are huge in my family and I’ve been self medicating for too long. Trust ur docs to help you through this and do things right.

From ‘05-‘14 i was a heavy drinker, arguably an “alcoholic” to those who believe in labels. Got sober in ‘14 and then introduced to Kratom in ‘16. Didn’t take long before the obsession kicked in. Since then, I’ve been a daily user (approximately 10gpm during an evening ritual) - kinda weird that anything more than 10gpm didn’t do sh*t for me. I took a few weeks off back in ‘18 and then 6 months off in ‘19. 

July ‘19 to July 6th, ‘20 I used daily. I don’t know what happened, or what sign I picked up, but something told me I needed to stop. My relationship is suffering some blows because of my inability to rationally think. Perhaps it’s the Kratom, obsession, etc. that is causing this. I’ve also found myself sneaking it every night around my partner. He is the most stand up, supportive guy that the guilt associated with this one big lie is somewhat overwhelming. 

Regardless, I want to quit Kratom. I took 2gpm Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday night to ensure I slept throughout the evening. It worked. However, this time of quitting is a much different experience than the last 2 or 3 times I’ve quit. The depression and loneliness has been so triggering and a familiar feeling I experienced when I was a heavy drinker. Bottom line, this hasn’t been as easy as I thought it would be. 

Friday night was a no-sleep night, resulting from the withdrawal. I expected at least a handful of nights of these nights. Last night, I dosed 2gm before bed to ensure a full night sleep - it worked. I don’t feel too guilty as I knew my intention behind it was to sleep rather than to feel the euphoric feeling produced by Kratom. But also don’t want this to become my norm. Tonight I will attempt to not dose at all. 

I also loaded up on SAM-E (AM), Ashwaghanda (AM), 5-HTP (AM), Magnesium (PM), BSO (PM), Zinc (PM), Valerian Root extract (PM). Hopefully these start kicking in and making a noticeable difference. I also do physical activity 1x/per day at a minimum. 

Before, I used a 12-step program to help me stay sober. I also didn’t experience any withdrawal symptoms even though I was dosing the same. I believe the support of others really helped me stay on the right path away from this sludge previously, but the program itself left little to desire after a considerable period of time. Thankfully, I found this group as it is the virtual supper system I believe I can rely on.

The words, the stories, the inspiration will help me as I navigate through this weird journey back to complete sobriety. :-)",3,0

That one realization completely shifted the way I approached quitting. For the longest time it was because money, time, inconvenience, all of which are motivators. But for whatever reason, the fact I get negative pleasure from it is the one that hammered it home.

The trouble was starting with low grade powder, moving to enhanced powder, to homemade extracts and, eventually, OPMS, MIT45, etc. There is nowhere left to go for stronger kratom. Realizing I had hit a ceiling was scary, and lasted a while, but was the motivator I needed. 

In the last three weeks, I reverted to powder only, found a stable point and began cutting considerably. The progress feels great, and not paying for 2-4 shots a day, every day, has saved so much money.

If you are like me and really want to quit...this may help.  It helped me.  What you do is make a tea and “sip” - I mean sip extremely small amounts throughout the day.  Remind yourself it will only hurt you by sipping large amounts of tea by not tapering( and make you extremely tired).  To make tea:  put 4 or 5 grams of k in a freezable container (can use a 32 oz gadorade bottle).  Put one tablespoon apple cider vinegar or 2 fresh squeezed lemons in.  Add warm or hot water.  Freeze.  (Something about freezing helps the alkaloids to make it more potant or something).  Take out early next morning and defrost under hot water.  Take little sips throughout the day for one week.  I swear, something about sipping the tea will help your body decrease the amount of k by an amazing factor.  I was originally toss and washing 20-50 grams and this helped me decrease amount of k in my system tremendously.  Then, buy some supplements to help you heal your brain.  Can research this online- but I heard “heal your brain, heal your life” and I truly believe it.  Then buy a small amount ofcapsules of k.  Each capsule is .5 grams.  Take 4 capsules 3 or 4 x day for 2-3 days, 3 capsules 3 or 4 x day, 2 capsules..... then 1 capsule 3 or 4 times a day.  Make sure throw out ALL remaining k.  Link your brain to k= pain and being sober = positivity and pleasure.  Think of all pain and negative things k has led you.  Going to meetings has also helped me a lot.  But that’s just me.  

I feel like I’m in this pink cloud and everything in new to me with sober eyes.  I’m playing my guitar again, listening to music, enjoying sex, and having a stronger desire to connect with people.  There’s this amazing power I’ve feeling, hard to explain, but it’s beautiful.

It took me yet another near-sleepless night 2 weeks ago, at 4:30am, to finally do so. ""Oh great! Another woo-woo hippy trippy tree-hugging wannabe eastern munk who probably claims he can break wooden planks with just the power of his mind ala 1970s kung-fu movies."" I thought to myself. Was I right? ... No. I was wrong. Sure, at first glance he seems ""out there"". His breathing technique, the first time I tried it, made me look like I was giving birth... And I'm a guy! But, I didn't have to dig too far to find out that Wim Hof is a 61 year old man with an average build who likes to eat pasta, drink an occasional beer, curses sometimes and loves his kids. Oh, and he likes to climb mountains shirtless in snow storms. There's also those 27 world records of his. And he dives into freezing cold lakes for fun. And there was that time he nearly died when his retinas froze, he went temporarily blind and lost consciousness under frozen water. And... he talked doctors into injecting him with endotoxin (yay! Science!) and he didn't appear to display any flu-like symptoms which would have made most people very sick. Then he trained a group of people to do his methods, they too were injected with the endotoxin, and supposedly they didn't get sick either.

So, what does Wim Hof have to do with quitting Kratom? At first glance, nothing. But after trying his very simple breathing exercises (which he admits isn't anything he invented), which only takes 10 minutes to do, as skeptical as I was, I must admit, I was hooked. What is one of the top things people withdrawing from Kratom (or most any drug) suffer from? Did you say anxiety? You'd be correct. How did I feel after my first time doing 3 rounds of WHM breathing (which, did I mention only took 10 minutes!)? Calm. Relaxed, yet a little energized at the same time. Focused. And quite honestly, slightly lightheaded (which went away as soon as I started breathing normally again). Slightly ""high""? Maybe. Very very slightly. Like CBD slightly.

To sum up, at the very least, researching Wim Hof and his techniques, with an open mind (or even with a skeptic's mind like me), will keep you busy and possibly distract you from Kratom and help you get through withdrawals for a couple days. Personally, I've been doing his breathing method and taking cold showers for 2 weeks now. I've not wanted to use Kratom. I rarely think about Kratom. And on my 23rd day Kratom-free at the time of this writing, other than a now mild form of Insomnia (which I wouldn't even call Insomnia any more), I don't seem to be displaying any withdrawal symptoms. 

Do I walk around every moment of every day feeling like I'm riding a unicorn and pooping rainbows? Of course not. But, do I wake up every morning wishing I didn't... like my final couple months using Kratom? No. Absolutely not. Not once. Did Wim Hof Method make withdrawal symptoms dissipate faster? That's hard to say. What I will say is ""life"", the past 2 weeks, has been easier and more enjoyable than the first week or so of Kratom withdrawals. Do I still have back pain and joint stiffness? Yes. But not nearly as bad or as debilitating as it used to be. Do I think WHM is a ""quick fix"". No. Do I think it will help you get through withdrawals and life in general a little easier? Yes. Will I keep practicing the 3 basic phases of WHM and continue looking into and trying other breathing techniques and practices? Yes. In addition to WHM, I'm looking into Tummo (which is similar), Kriya, Holotropic breathwork (maybe?) and more. Even stopping for a moment and doing slow 6 second deep inhales and exhales, like journalist James Nestor describes in his book ""Breath"", is very helpful. 

In my opinion, breathing *may* be the missing ingredient in many peoples recovery from Kratom. I mean, it's a part of us... a vital part to living, right? So why not take advantage of it. Try it. If you don't like it, stop. (Well, don't stop breathing, silly! You know what I mean.) Above all, don't give up hope. You can get through Kratom withdrawals and stay away from using Kratom one day at a time... one hour at a time... one minute at a time... one breath at a time.

**TL/DR: As Wim Hof would say, ""BREATH MOTHER F@&KER!!!""**",15,0

I'm 14 days in today, which feels like a huge accomplishment.  But, every week I'm super clean and then Friday and Saturday I'll have two beers each day.  I love trying new beers, and two seems harmless enough, but man do I feel like crap today.  I'm not sure why I keep doing this- weekdays feel great at pumped after workouts, weekends feel hungover and slightly depressed.  It's a weird cycle.   
My first thought after waking up is regret.  The 2nd thought is that kratom would really help mask the mild hangover and me get going.

The good news is I'm 100% sure I won't ever go back to kratom.  Been there, done that twice.  Also that I'm 100% sure I won't dive hard into alcohol... I realize my limits, have self control to not let it get out of hand, and don't like the feeling of being super drunk.  I think I just need to be completely abstinent from it for at least a couple of months to give myself a chance to keep building on the momentum I gain during the week.  It's just my addictive brain saying ""go ahead and have a couple to celebrate another workweek in the books.  Anyone with similar stories, please let me know about your experience.  

It should be relatively easy since my wife and my best friend don't drink.  It's just my own mind.  I thought about asking my wife to join me in the challenge, since she admittedly has a self-control problem with sugar, but I'm pretty sure she would take that the wrong way lol.  ""Why, do you think Im getting fat or something?""  So, if anyone here wants to join me in keeping each other accountable in not drinking or whatever substance, let me know, and we can set up a message chain.  The daily checkins (especially on the weekends) would help me a lot!  Thanks in advance.",2,1

So I wanted to share another update on my progress.  I seriously didn't think I could do a taper, but I am doing it and getting closer to almost being free!!  The benefits to tapering this time have allowed me to have minimal disruption to my life and still be productive which although has been rough has worked out great.

I did a half ironman (1.2 mile swim, 56 mile bike, and 13.1 mile run) yesterday while tapering!!!  Luckily sense it was an official ironman I was able to get in my car between each event and drink a gram of kratom to get me through it.  However, by the end of each event I was pretty damn beat up.  But I still cannot believe I pulled this off while tapering off this junk.  But what I've learned from this is pretty cool how my body has slowly weaned off this stuff.  I think it's def absolutely true that it takes about an entire week for your body to adjust to the new lower dose.  Each time I've dropped, it's been ugly, but it's been more manageable than when I went CT the last time and agonized in crazy w/d's for 4 days straight.  The best part is although there are a lot of bad days, as I get adjusted to each lower dose and I start feeling good again..there are good days.  I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I think the black seed oil has also been helping tremendously too though.  And I've been taking 5htp and ashwanda.  

Also, in case anyone thinks you have to have a scale, I'm here to tell you that's not true.  Even though my gram count might not be perfectly accurate, I read there are 4 grams in a teaspoon so that's how I've determined my gram count.  To taper I started off with using a whole teaspoon split up every 4-5 times per day.  Then when I got to 20 grams I started using a half teaspoon 4-5 times a day.  Then once I got to 7 grams a day, started using a 1/4 of teaspoon 4-5 times per day.  My goal for the next 3 days is to hit 3 grams a day and then next week drop to 2 - 1 grams.  However, I am almost out of k too so whenever i run out, that's when I am jumping off for good.  

Here is what my taper has looked like so far.

Numbers are in GPD

342,2020-07-11 19:44:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hpkeg6/almost_9_months/,Almost 9 Months,"A while ago someone asked me if I got better. I said I would make an update, but I've had trouble coming up with words to explain certain things or what I think could help others.

First yes, I have gotten better. 

Fueled by coronavirus lockdown, but I've become interested in a new job and I have been doing - and enjoying - a lot of studying for it. Luckily I already have a lot of the required background, but my existing work has not used it, so I am looking at doing some personal projects so showcase that I have the relevant skills. It is for sure going to be very challenging but I'm excited about it.

As for the kratom recovery, it was difficult - extemely, at times - as you are all well aware. I have thought many times throughout my journey about what to tell people so that they may be more successful with qutting, but sadly I think there is no universal answer or guidance. One thing I can suggest - but its not the whole answer - is to find what motivates you and leverage it as much as you can to get through this. For me, it was just seeing how long I could go. I've always been good at endurance, so I just kept saying to myself 'let's see if I can go a little more'. If there is one thing that quitting drugs certainly requires, it's determination and endurance, and a lot of it.

As for long term side effects I do still have what seems to be a very fickle libido - at times its fine, and then for 2 weeks it can drop a lot or even shut off completely (I am male, 34, but this clearly became a problem after reaching zero gpd). The libido drops seem to come at the same time as PAWS episodes (which I don't have anymore) and with pimple outbreaks (which I do still have).

At this point, not having symptoms and feeling mentally sharp with my memory back... it feels like regaining freedom. I appreciate that a lot, and it feels very good to feel normal. I guarantee you will come out of it saying it was worth the pain and struggle. You will at some point begin to enjoy some very regular things in life again (or enjoy them more), and you may even have a subtle moment where it feels a bit weird. In a way, it can feel like a new experience.

I wish you all the best of luck on your quitting journeys. Know that if you get through this you'll have accomplished something you can be very proud of.",23,3

I’ve been taking kratom for the last 18 months and was loving it. I already loved my life and kratom just made it better. I was able to workout longer, my career was flourishing and it just made everything more enjoyable. I called it the Limitless plant because of the movie. It just helped me excel at stuff. 

After a few months 1 dose became 2 and then 2 doses became 3. I slowly crept up from 2-5 GPD to some days as high as 40-50 GPD.

One day I forgot to take it and began experiencing withdrawals (anxiety, depression, RLS, body aches. I realized, wow....I have a problem. 

After reading everything I can about quitting I decided to go with a long slow taper. I would rather plan it out, weigh out all my doses and take the time to slowly go off with less withdrawal symptoms (cause wow they’re awful)


Started taking just 20 GPD split up into 5 doses of 4 grams and stayed at that until my body adjusted and I didn’t feel withdrawals anymore.

Now I will shave off .25/gram a dose (1.25 grams off a day) until my body adjusts and then rinse and repeat until I get to 0

I’m expecting this to take anywhere from 4-6 months.

Was wondering if other people on this board did tapers this long and still experienced bad withdrawals when they no longer took kratom?",4,0

After that 9 grams i obviously had a horrible time in and out of panic attacks, vertigo, and didn’t sleep for three days.

I never really had an issue with panic attacks but ever since that day i’m constantly on edge and have terrible anxiety, i depersonalize all day, and went from being a daily weed smoker to not even being able to smell it without having a panic attack.

There is a lingering sense of longing for the stimulation when I isolate myself and let myself be bored. But good exercise provides enough euphoria to satisfy.

Going through a rough time but I think I will make it out okay.","My main symptoms are going back and forth from feeling hot and cold, intense fatigue, body aches, and I am unable to sleep. I feel pretty terrible. I am also coping with heartache. I started using kratom about 3 years ago and used it on and off. I had been through withdrawals a few times but never anything like this, this one is brutal. This most recent period of use I used it for about 3 months daily, using somewhere from 8-14 grams. When I had went through withdrawals in the past, I usually had some body discomfort for a few days and then felt depressed for a week. I am dreading the mental symptoms after the physical ones, but I will make it through.

Me and my ex broke up about half a year ago. The heartache is probably the hardest part of going through these withdrawals. I was using kratom during my previous relationship of 1.5 years. We spent all our time together and were very close. She saw the absolute worst of me for a long time and eventually ended the relationship. I don't blame her, I had no drive and was using drugs the whole time. The breakup was 100% my fault. She is a great gal which makes it even harder. Truly a nice and genuine person. 

I was using on and off near the end of the breakup. After we broke up I stayed clean for about 2 months. Eventually I started using on and off because the pain was so hard to deal with. That's how I got to where I am today. Now that I quit the feelings came rushing back. I was weak and sad and reached out to her asking to get back together. Of course she said no.

I am unemployed currently and have no direction really. I am hoping to get my motivation and excitement for life back with time. I do want to try to get back with my ex still, she said she was open to going on dates with me which is a good sign, but she said she is very wary given our past and my bad habits. I am going to work to become the best version of myself everyday and hopefully she will be able to see that. My plan is to take her on dates for a month and demonstrate how I am working towards a better future and then ask her to be my girlfriend again. And if it doesn't work out with her I know I will still be okay.

I've made a connection that I wish I hadn't - potential liver issues can cause the types of spider veins I am seeing and I would definitely be a candidate for liver problems.  I drank heavily for 3 years before using kratom heavily for 3 years.  Did all kinds of shit before that too.  I remember that my liver enzymes were elevated from the drinking and probably had 6 months of sobriety before I started on the kratom.  I somehow convinced myself that kratom was safe for the liver.  

I've had the most half-assed up and down rollercoaster 3 month taper.  I started tapering because K was giving me rashes, dark eye circles, severe fatigue, and just overall looking ill.  As I came down from 40gpd to about 10gpd, a lot of the side effects started to let up enough that I would abuse it again for periods of time.  Around this time I noticed the vascular changes and should have stopped because they've only gotten worse.  I've been so reckless to keep using it, I could've been off a month ago if I had controlled myself.  I also took an antibiotic in the middle of all of this that is known for causing liver damage and my appetite diminished markedly during that time.  It's never quite recovered.  But the poor appetite, changes to my fingernails, rashes, and spider veins have me very concerned and the anxiety of coming off this shit is killing me because now I can't shake the concern that my liver may be showing damage.  Scariest part is symptoms of liver damage often don't manifest until severe disease is present.  

I'm tired of looking at my red face in the mirror and splotchy red rash on my chest.  I'm tired of worrying about these spider veins and what the kratom is doing to me.  I have a doctors appointment in 3 weeks and my goal is to be 100% off it by then.  I've taken about 4.4 grams the last 2 days and it's been hell because I dropped from 7.  But I want so fucking bad to stop taking this shit.  I have next Thurs, Fri, and Sat off and I'm seriously considering jumping.  I know it does little good to worry about this until I see the doctor but I honestly can't seem to help it.  It's going to be a long 3 weeks of withdrawing and worrying about my health.

I just made the decision not to take any more kratom unless I felt wd symptoms I wanted to keep at bay. I took no kratom all day. The WD symptoms never came. 

I felt lethargic as usual, and that always makes kratom a tempting option, but other than that, nothing-- not even ""mild symptoms"" (and I tried CT at first, weeks ago, so I know what the symptoms feel like!). I'll admit I took half a Lunesta to help fall asleep last night, but insomnia was my norm before I ever touched kratom (as were depression and anxiety). It's now 3:30 pm the next day, and I still feel no WD symptoms. Maybe a little bit of diarrhea, but that could be the magnesium I'm taking. Also, I feel slightly less lethargic today (could be chalked up to the fact that I got Lunesta sleep, but trying to stay optimistic about it).

So, in short, I'm thinking the taper was effective-- in fact, effective beyond what my expectations had been. I mean, I've read some of the horror stories about ""Day 3/4/5"" and I'm ready for whatever might come, but my final doses were so small that I'm just not so sure that's even going to be a problem.  Tapering has taken me a long way from the pits of bitter green chalkdust hell to a place where I feel like I can become a real functioning human again. 

TLDR: it has gone well. If anyone has any questions or could use any guidance or support, please feel free to hit me up, I'd be happy to help.

One disclaimer I'll just add here is that I don't have any comorbid addictions- it was just kratom for me... so, the experience might be different for someone who ""also has other stuff going on"" substance-wise. But, the green powder can be defeated!",8,0

However, I’ve never totally stepped off the k train. I told my fiancée my goal is to quit ktom before we get married, so I’m in the midst of tapering. She hasn’t really had a problem with it except the times my use gets up so high my sex drive is totally gone and various days where I just keep scooping spoon fulls out of the bag like a compulsive person.

Anyway, I’ve never taken that last step. Every time I somehow end up going back up. Usually it’s to do with life stress and putting it off, but deep down I fear my life without kratom. I love it when I use small doses, and even though my fiancée would probably not mind if I were just a 1-3 gram every once in a while user, I want to keep my word.

Does getting off 1gram  really have much of a *physical* impact? Keep in mind I’ve oscillated between 1gpd and up to an oz per day in the past 7 years. I have had the restless legs and lack of sleep (which has caused a lot of crying, sometimes quicker to anger) in this current taper, but nothing outrageous yet. Idk if the vendors I’ve purchased from have anything to do with my withdrawals seeming less intense than what I read on here.

Also is PAWS maybe just depression or pre-existing conditions simply returning? I know I felt like shit before I started kratom, so I sort of expect to feel that after (but hopefully less so, as I rock climb about 20 hr a week, even on days I haven’t been sleeping).

Is that helping this be less bad? A few days ago I felt my life was over and totally pointless (I hadn’t gotten to climb in a few days), and now I feel somewhat okay, (I don’t mind having the shits working remotely lol). But Once I adjust to this dose, taper more, get down to that gram or two, is I’d gonna be worse than a jump from up to oz per day to 6gpd?

368,2020-07-10 11:19:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hoqsd4/my_escape_from_kratom/,My Escape From Kratom,"Hi everyone. I've been reading a lot of your experiences on here, and first I want to express my gratitude. Thank you so much. Now I'm going to ramble about myself for a long time and hopefully help somebody.

Today is my fifth day entirely sober after a jagged and undisciplined (borderline disastrous) taper, so take what follows with a grain of salt. I started taking kratom back in early February of this year after breaking my heel bone in a climbing accident. At the time I had 27 months sober in AA. I guess my excuse at the time was that I needed something more effective for the pain than NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Prescription opioids seemed too risky for an alcoholic (and part-time polysubstance abuser) like me. Besides, it's a damned plant I've never heard of before, so how bad could it be? So, I tried some. Pretty soon I was up to a 50+gpd habit. Every day, continuously.

It started to become clear that kratom was becoming a problem for me over the past few months as I found myself spending upwards of $325 per month buying red vein maeng da and other strains off slick websites, basically emptying my bank account (I'm poor), redlining my credit cards, and finally resulting to the use of loansharks to get me to the next paycheck. 

I was waking up in the middle of the night to take more- otherwise I could not sleep. I was taking it in the morning- otherwise, I could not get up. If I tried to cut down I felt unbearably jittery, to the point of needing to move my arms and legs almost constantly to try to minimize the discomfort. Forget about sleeping without it. Constant constipation became an issue. I lost a lot of weight (not such a bad thing, I thought). Still, I did not feel that it compromised the quality of my work, so I delayed stopping as long as I could. If you're here, I'm willing to bet that you loved this stuff for what it did for you, once. I did too.

(The entire time, I had been lying by omission to my fiance and people in AA, although I was vaguely truthful with my sponsor.) 

Finally, the track ran out. I realized I had made some very poor decisions over the months I was on the stuff, my financial situation had become untenable, and it was time to stop. Actually, that had been the situation for months. What really forced my hand was that I simply ran out and could not obtain more in time to prevent withdrawal. So, it began. I had withdrawn from alcohol many times, but this was something else. Anyone who has gone through it will understand. I was so desperate for relief from the restlessness and fear that I impulsively downed a nearly-full bottle of 70% rubbing alcohol (isopropanol) after reading online that it wouldn't kill me. I blacked out and destroyed my TV by hurling a Playstation controller at it. My fiance fled to stay with her mom. My breath began to stink of acetone, and I began to feel perhaps more physically ill than I ever had before. Traces of blood in the bile sick. I'll spare you the rest. I survived because I didn't die- that's it. I just endured. It sucked. One of my friends sent me three bottles of cold gatorade through an app, and I am still so grateful for that I want to cry.

The story goes on for a bit, detours into a relapse on alcohol, ends with yet another catastrophic brownout on the Fourth of July (Independence Day here in the US) during which I somehow got shot in the leg by a homeless man with a pellet rifle and sliced my own hand open with a knife, and ends with a last dose of kratom administered to me by my fiance to get me through a final dramatic collapse, then a 16-hour sleep, and freedom. I feel I have been released. I feel finally free.

I hear a lot on this forum about PAWS, and I did experience a LOT of residual restlessness. I was unable to sit still, to the point that I decided to limp (I still have ankle problems from my fall) 16km through Orange County, CA, in the sun, with no supplies, because I am an idiot. But in the end, I made it, and you can too. One of the most common issues I hear about with PAWS is that after subsidence of physical symptoms, lingering emotional problems may begin. So far, that has not been my story, and I credit the fact that I have built up a good support network and a reasonably workable program of recovery over the years in AA. Relapse doesn't erase the work we've done in recovery. We get back up and keep building our lives. I have multiple entries about me in the DSM-V, so that was a big worry. What I am trying to say is that, if kratom became the only (seemingly) worthwhile thing in your life, then when that is taken away it is to be expected that you will feel empty, dull, flat, sad, unmotivated, and possibly out-of-control or downright suicidal.

Get into a recovery network. AA, NA, Recovery Dharma, Rational Recovery, SMART, whatever. It doesn't matter. I'm a firm agnostic in AA and I'm here to tell you that what is important is that you have people in your life who know and love you, that you take their advice to heart, and that you work with them to figure out a way for you to live a sober life that brings you fulfillment and a sense of purpose. Everything starts there. I feel that I have started a new chapter of my story, thanks to a lot of help from strangers and friends. The future does not seem as bleak as it once did. No matter how bad things get, no matter how seemingly unbearable, you WILL survive and you WILL recover and you WILL find a life you look forward to waking up to. All you need to do is open up, seek help, and have faith.

Thank you for letting me share. I love you all.",27,0

Has anyone experienced chest pressure or shortness of breath from Kratom? 
I’ve had a chest X-ray, blood tests, inhaler, echocardiogram, sleep test, and echocardiograph and put on allergy meds. All of that in a few months coming out of being relatively active at work and fit. (Covid has had me going from an active walking job to sitting at a desk at home for a few months)
I also just had a covid test but I don’t have any other symptoms. Won’t know from that for 5 days but it’s unlikely the cause since no flu symptoms. 

I started having heart racing palpitations two-three months ago such that I called a ambulance one morning. Three episodes of thinking I was having atrial fib. They said normal ecg but high heart rate so I waited to see my PCP rather than go to ER. This was middle of covid shutdown and the hospital is a dreadful place I didn’t want to go. Then I got all the heart tests and it was all normal. 

About two weeks ago I started having shortness of breath. This was totally new and never experienced from kratom. It’s worse at night or with minor exertion even talking. In the morning after not dosing for 8-12 hours I notice it’s not so bad but I’m almost sore in my lungs and chest. But I’ve also been at rest for a long time so could be I’m just calmed down. My heart will also sit around 85-95 sometimes after dosing.

I almost quit Kratom when the heart thing happened. Went from not measuring 35+grams a day to about 14 measured out. Then my heart stuff cleared up and I back slid. 
Today I’m going back to small doses and going to try again to taper and quit. 
I’m tired of spending money on it, being shady to my family, and not having control. It helps me be lethargic and over eat and use more tobacco. It was such a miracle when I found Kratom. And it was always a energy, relaxation, mood, everything booster. But after a few years it’s seemed to turn on me or Im just doing something wrong. 

Has Kratom caused these symptoms in anyone? Maybe the covid test will come back that I have a super mild case of it and that’s the cause. I almost hope so that way I am not in limbo anymore. 

In the mean time, I wish I could just quit this stuff. It made me feel like such a better version of myself for so long and now I’m just so tired of it but my weak mind can’t handle the stupid withdrawal feelings. 

Alternatively- anxiety. I don’t want to be stuck on a SSRI my whole life. I guess if the symptoms continue if covid test is negative and I manage to taper way down I’ll have to see about anxiety. But my symptoms never feel set off by my mind. They just happen. No thoughts about them before they happen or anything like that.",1,5

I've always social anxiety but I know it really took a turn for the worse when I got addicted to xanax a few years ago. 

Kratom was a godsend for my anxiety, namely green strains. It gave me so much confidence and energy- I never had to think about what I was going to say. My conversations were able to flow and it helped me make a lot of friends. Granted, my subsequent addiction never allowed me to pursue most of those friendships but still.
I don't know if it's the kratom withdrawals (paws), or the social anxiety, or the coffee I drink, but it seems like every night I'm completely dissociated from other people. It feels like there's nothing I can do about it. Like I'm physically there but my mind is just a blank slate and when I try to bring conscious, positive thoughts to fruition I just blank out again. Eye contact and conversation feels impossible when I get like this.

I guess my question is whether this a symptom that other people experience? Does it get better? I don't see my psychiatrist for another 3 months and I'm already on 25mg seroquel but I'm just not sure how to address this.

The initial high of being off of Kratom was short lived, around day 6-10 I hit a mild, then deep, and then mild depression. I've since recovered from it. All is good, though. I sincerely expected to have the depression hit, and I don't expect it to be completely over as I've also been clean from Opiates and Benzos for 262 days now, and I guess that experience kind of let me know what to expect in a general sense. I finally learned to stop looking for what to expect and to start finding out what will happen. Idk, not much to say other than I'm on day 17, and at the moment, my sleep is stabilizing more and more, I'm normally a 10p - 430-630a sleeper anyways, and I'm hitting that mark most nights, and some sneezing still yet. I know that the entire virus thing and staying home isn't helping very much, plus I've put my life on hold to care for my mother with late term Dementia, and that in itself is mentally and physically exhausting to say the least, but I'm making it. I can no longer afford to make a single excuse to do anything! I simply can not bear the thought of being someone that I'm not any longer! I know that things will work out in due time as they always do! Life is this weird thing where you can never figure out what your situation is, or what it means until way after the fact, but that's all good. I'm 28 years old, no wife, no kids, have placed my entire life on hold to care for my mother, and selfishly in the back of my mind I can't help but wonder, what does this mean for me? I'm already 10 years behind other people my age, in large part from my own hands, but will I ever get the chance to buy a house, a car, marry, have children? I guess it will work out how it's supposed to in the end, but I don't really know. I'm sure these are common fears we all face. I also have to remind myself that in all reality, I'm still VERY young, given that life expectancy is like 75 years old. On a closing note, I'd like to leave you all with some mindset's that helped me, and that maybe you can mold to your own self as well. I was fortunate enough to have a chance encounter with a Navy SEAL whom honestly changed my life, and gave me some insight on what they're taught to think. The biggest one is when you hit that breaking point, you CAN take 7x more. Also, the mind gives WAY before the body does. Lastly, it's okay to fail. Everyone fails, everyone thinks about failing, and everyone thinks about quitting. You can think about it all that you want, but just don't do it. Idk, that helped me, I hope it will give you some motivation to push through just one more day. I know life can seem so bleak today, hopeless, cold, and like the world has left you behind, but just remember, like my uncle always told me, ""The sun don't shine on the same dog's ass every day!"".

This forum helped me a lot so I thought I’d post some test results that might motivate some of you to stick with it. For reference I’m a 32 yr old healthy male. At two months completely K free I was feeling great but my sex drive was still coming and going. My doctor ordered a blood test and my results were:
Total Testosterone : 358 (very low)
Luteinizing Hormone: 13.0 (normal range is 1.7-8.6)
Didn’t test free testosterone but I’m sure it was crazy low

My doctor wanted to check me again in another 30 days and I’m happy to say stuff is rebounding 
Total Testosterone: 585
Luteinizing Hormone: 10.8 ( still a little high)
Free Testosterone : 77.2 (not awful but on low end)
SHBG: 66.3 (normal range 16.5-55.9)

My sex drive has returned, and I’m feeling great overall. I’m sure my numbers will bounce back even more. I workout 5 days a week, and eat very healthy which has definitely helped. I take ashwaganda and alpha test booster to help speed stuff up and they seem to be helping as well.

Most of it is in a persons head. A lot of H addicts don't even experience PAWS because they have never read into it.

I highly recommend a quick sub taper for high dose kratom use. So I'm sure I'll survive acutes but staying clean is the hard part. I'm gonna have to do therapy or meetings or I'll end up back on kratom. I'm feeling pretty optimistic this time maybe because I've been through all this before.

For anyone who missed my previous posts, I was only taking kratom for less than a month, but I went CT and it was still horrible.

Days 1-3 were a complete, I mean A COMPLETE personal hell for me. Crippling anxiety, hot and cold, GI issues, depression, agitation, and such a feeling of not being well. I had to really focus on just one hour at a time.

Days 4-5 started to become more manageable but I was still writhing in anxiety and completely uncomfortable.

Yesterday was Day 6 and I actually started to feel a bit better.

Today is Day 7. I am sitting here working from home and suddenly noticed that I feel no anxiety and feel generally a lot better. I am feeling so much gratitude right now! Here's what I did:

&#x200B;

1. I got some medical attention and some meds to keep my brain comfortable (propranolol (I like it better than colodine), Ativan, and Gabapentin. These only slightly took the edge off for the first 3 days, but got more effective, and now on Day 7, I am almost off all of them.
2. I used OTC meds to help with the physical symptoms (Advil, Imodium, Gravol)
3. As soon as I could, I forced myself to eat as healthy as possible. My appetite came back on Day 4, and I was eating 3 healthy meals.
4. Vitamins in the morning, and LOTS of water / herbal tea.
5. Went for long drives in the country to keep my mind occupied when the anxiety was at its worst. 
6. Posted here and a few other places often so not to feel alone.
7. Printed out ""THIS TOO SHALL PASS"" and stuck it where I would see it every morning.

I realize that a lot of people here have been on kratom much longer than I, but I am hoping this helps someone.",10,0

Kratom has completely wrecked my life. I was hooked bad for 5 years (2012-2017). At the worst of it, I was bedridden. I would take those gold caps from head shops and would have to dose 4X/day in order to not go insane. I would maybe get some relief one in five uses but would be in w/d pretty much all day. I would often overdose and find myself shaky with severe virtigo that made it impossible to walk. Finally got on heroin and was able to quit that (NOT A RECOMMENDATION!!). 

I had two years clean off of everything but recently (a month ago) had the bright idea to mess with kratom again. I mixed with high doses of phenibut daily. Toward the end I was back to incredibly high daily doses and withdrawing socially again. The days leading up to July 4th I mixed kratom and phenibut with booze without food. Totally insane. I ended up missing 4th of July with my family because i did not want them to see that I looked like i had been using again. 

Finally said enough is enough. I came clean and on July 6 dumped everything. Even though I only used for a month, it’s been a very intense three days. It felt just as dark and lonely as I ever remembered during those five years. I felt like the world was collapsing. I would have waves of pure panic and a dark, lonely existential depression. The world just seemed so alien. I felt so envious of others who were not in my predicament. It was hell. I am sure I was w/ding from phenibut too. 

But other than a wave of panic which woke me up this AM (it always comes in waves for me), the worst seems to be over. Thank God i nipped it in the bud. I did not use any other drugs to detox. I wanted it to hurt in a way. I never want to touch kratom (or any other drug) again. I got ahold of many friends from 12 step fellowships and they were all happy to listen and give me encouragement. I’m grateful to be clean again. 

To anyone out there who is stuck on this stuff, it is no joke. I get it. My kratom habit messed my life up more than many tweakers and dope fiends had their lives ruined by their drugs. Just know that there is hope. Getting clean is not easy. But find a way. Most detoxes will taper using suboxone now days which can be very helpful. I do not like the idea of suboxone maintenance (been there, done that) but as a tapering tool under doctor supervision it is very helpful.",18,0

I've been taking it since may 2019, i went up to huge 50g+ doses 4 or 5 times a day, then tapered down to 4 grams of capsules 8-11 times per day, on which i'd only be able to sleep a couple hours at a time and have to redose multiple times a night. If you're noticing my sentence structure is kinda stupid it's because i have been having seizures for a few days now. I bought some phenibut thinking it would help me sleep and ease the dysphoria and depression, which it did, but i also had a seizure and i'm not really sure what happened, over the course of a couple days I think i had 4-5 of them. The last one was yesterday i think, but I'm still having trouble forming sentences and words and my brain feels very limited compared to how it usually is. I have to relearn everything and do everything manually, like i'm doing it for the first time... typing is easier now but it was nearly impossible at first, I used to have 140+wpm but i just could not remember how to spell anything. I am slurring my speech and generally seem off and I cn't stop noticing how bad my thoughts are. So after the seizures started happening at first I didn't take the kratom, but after a day or so passed and i became mostly conscious I decided to go back on kratom because I didn't want to keep having seizures, but then i had another one. That was a day ago and i'm still kind of slow, i haven't returned to normal. stopped taking phenibut and threw it away after the seizures obviously. So IDK if it's withdrawal, phenibut, or kratom causing the seizures, I also take dextroamphetamine and memantine daily. Dex is prescribed and I think memantine helps me with addiction and depression and functioning in general but i know the NMDA shit can get weird so i dunno if that's a factor in all this. Should i go cold turkey again or try and taper back down? has this happened to anyone else and did your brain return to normal working condition eventually thanks.",1,0

Before I knew it, I would run out and feel so terrible in the morning without taking it, and at first I didn't even realize that it was the K doing it. Of course I figured that out, but I was still too weak to just stop CT.  I should have tried harder back then when I was only taking 10gpd. Eventually I got myself to taper from 10 to 4 Gpd, and was doing so well, but I caved for no good reason and shot right back up. I don't know if it's my body chemistry or what, but even going from 10 to 9 was so difficult for me. And when I caved I ruined the couple months of hard work of going from 10 to 4gpd.

I've fast forward 2 years and I'm taking 40gpd. I'm scared about what it's doing to my body, but I can't quit CT. It's unbearable for me. Even taking doses 5 times per day gets me too up and down (I get a buzz for about 30minutes from 8g dose and within another hour or two, I feel like garbage.

I've found that for me, taking as many really small doses throughout the day evenly spread out works the best.  I'm at 35gpd and I take 1 gram doses every 40 minutes throughout the day, and that's the only way I'm able to not get wd feelings. Before I go to bed I take a larger dose (maybe 3g) so I don't wake up every couple hours or so with RLS. (Doing that I wake up maybe twice during the night and take 2g to get me to sleep another 3 hours or so.) I just feel like I'm so sensitive to this drug, and I can't stand it controlling my life anymore. Every time I start doing well with tapering down, I fuck up one day, and I always tell myself that it was just one day, but one day turns into two, and two days becomes a week, and before I know it I'm worse than I was before I began the taper.

414,2020-07-08 05:24:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hndxvo/wish_me_luck/,Wish Me Luck,"So I started taking kratom at some point last year because it was offered to me and I really enjoyed it. Unfortunately I bought into the whole “there’s nothing wrong with it and it’s not addictive!!” propaganda that I had been exposed to. However, I never really had any issues with it. 
Earlier this year, as embarrassing as it is, I was having some girl troubles and started taking it regularly to deal with the anxieties of seeing her every day at work. I started taking like 2 grams twice a day, and sometimes I’d take 4 grams and then 2 later, but generally it was just 2 doses of 2. I’ve been good about not going too crazy with it due to the horror stories I’ve heard. Anyway, I’ve been taking it daily since January and I’ve reached the point where I really want to quit because I don’t even enjoy it when I take it anymore. At this point, I typically take 3 doses of 2 grams, and truthfully, it really sucks. Like ten minutes after I take it, I already want to take the other dose and I have to convince myself not to. I’ve come to the realization that it doesn’t help me like I felt it did in January. I want to try the tapering method, but once I take it, that ‘thirst’ for another dose is going to come back full force. I’ve gone 23 hours without kratom right now and I haven’t felt this anxious in a long time, and I get these random little dull headaches and I haven’t been able to focus on anything all day. 
The dealbreaker on quitting has pretty much been the fact that I’m already completely terrified of going bald, and thankfully, I don’t think the kratom has contributed much to hair loss, but I want to beat this before it gets out of control and I start losing chunks of hair. I can’t imagine how difficult this is for people that were taking 30 grams for years. 
I’m just so torn on whether or not I should taper or just take this day I’ve gone without it and run with it.",4,0

417,2020-07-07 23:51:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hn9xn1/14_days_of_introspection/,14 Days of Introspection,"Fourteen days CT for me after doing almost five years straight. It started innocently enough, but looking backwards I can only see an ocean of red flags. Towards the end, or at least when I had a moment of clarity, I noticed (how novel) that I was doing about 200gpd which is completely insane. I was going through some stuff like working literally eighty to ninety hours a week when I hit my peak use. Money wasn't an issue for me at the time, but I still didn't like the expense. I guess that I justified my usage because of several severe medical/psychological/emotional issues that continue to plague me because I've lived a hard life. This isn't my first addiction, but it crept up on me in my pride and arrogance. After all, it can't be worse than the heroin, or the codeine syrup, or the oxycodone, or the fentanyl, because you can just buy it. You can't even overdose on it. How miraculous! So magnificent! Who wouldn't dare? 

I decided to cut my doses in half several months ago from ~200gpd to ~100gpd, and then again to 50gpd or less. I immediately noticed that the chemical effects never changed when dropping dosage, but that there was a pervasive anxiety about doing so anyway. I was doing 40gpd or so when I purposefully decided to accidentally just run out.

I guess the hardest part is that I do legitimately miss all of the good things that I felt like I was getting out of it, even though I now realize what I was giving up to have those ""benefits"". Why, I even enjoyed the taste of it. 

I've been lurking here for a few weeks but only after I made the jump, and it is intriguing to me to see how many people have said things about their experiences that made me feel personally attacked in a sobering way (""the podcast drug"", disinterest in reading, lack of creative inclination, inability to viscerally appreciate music, lack of libido, emotional numbness, tinnitus, hair thinning, difficulty with gaining or maintaining muscle strength, etc.). I watched all of these things catch up to me and just didn't realize, or didn't want to heed them. This is disturbing to me because, in retrospect, I can remember very specific times that I was pushing things way too far and was willingly walking into my current situation. But unfortunately, I was completely functional for all of it. More damning than that, I was exemplary in fulfilling my more visible duties at work and home. I was a machine given a spirit by a bound demon. I was an automaton, unfeeling and unflinching in the face of the difficulties of life, and it only cost me some money and my sense of joy, and I thought that I loved it. Maybe I still romanticize it. After all, no one ever said a word in rebuke the whole time, and I was even given the accolades that I deeply craved after a lifetime of abuse. What did it matter if I felt anything about it? Isn't knowing a thing enough of a justification? Isn't fulfillment better than self-worth? Is complete apathy not a worthy price to pay to never again be haunted by the occasional existential dread and suicidality? The answer is ""no"" even if the lie of ""yes"" is attractive, but I still struggle with that.

The first few days were rough and everything that I was warned about, which I can only assume is because of the length of time I was using and the utterly absurd amount I was taking it, and I dread the future. Some of the recommendations for supplements were helpful, except weed (which I can't afford to mess with for my job) and phenibut (which I did not care for, which is probably for the best). I was at work through the whole thing, and my self imposed work ethic and quality is suffering for it. I can still do my job, but it is an unbearable weight recently. Thankfully, the few people who I can honestly tell the truth to are very empathetic and are tolerating my difficulties. I'm feeling better than I was a week ago but the worst part has been the lethargy and boredom, not to mention the return of my debilitating chronic pain/depression/anxiety issues. The pain is terrible but the boredom is infinitely worse. This is a blatantly obvious thing that I have always suffered from and tried to chase away with everything, but I have found that pursuing a passion is the best way around it without chasing any tricky, dangerous dragons. Regrettably, this is only possible when my time is my own and not beholden to anyone, but alas that I have bills to pay. I always try to make as much time for art as I possibly can. For me, this is music production and creation, or even the pleasure of finding and listening to something new or strange or weird. 

One thing that has solidified my resolve was that, after the worst of the acute withdrawals were done, I found myself playing more and better music after stagnation for years. It was like I suddenly gained all of the experience and inspiration that I had been struggling to attain for years in a matter of days or hours. My technique improved immensely, probably because I was using kratom as a depressant and sedative, which fucked with my coordination and CNS. Everything that I was playing, I could suddenly feel the merits of instead of throwing it into the trash or abandoning it, which I have been doing for a while. This ""newfound"" ability was infuriating to me, because I realized how much I had let kratom rob me of when, in the beginning, I thought it helped me (not that it didn't at first, because it did until I was just a side character in my own story, which is the danger).

But even now, knowing all of that on a fundamental level, I feel like I'm going to crack eventually. I always do, most likely because there's a deep sense of self-loathing and auto-hatred I have for myself that I do my best to ignore. Maybe most of us are here because of that sense of not liking ourselves or our lives, that lingering sense of dissatisfaction. But someone told me once that suicidality is, on its most fundamental level, the simple desire for change mixed with paralysis at the fear of change. Maybe we just need to change our perspectives and actually address the issues that led us here. I hope I can. The best thing that I can do is stay on the wagon and, if I fall off (likely eventually), just get back up instead of kicking myself and numbing that self-inflicted pain until I am ultimately consumed. An ouroboros is a symbol of eternal life but also unending death, and we have to choose. 

In the meantime, I'm proud of all of you for trying even if we occasionally fail. And if we fall, I will forgive us once we get back up. My mantra is from a song that I adore, and I'm trying to wear it like armor: ""All bets off, I plunge, only to find that self is shed"". It means something to me, anyway.

I was on about 10-15 gpd for about 6 months. (Yeah, I know, that’s nothing compared to some of you other guys on here!)

I am very impressed how much of you are pushing through this with 40+gpd for over a year of taking it.

The last three days were pretty bad but i think mild compared to much of you guys out there.

Today I felt pretty low, legs cramping, fatigue, sitting on the couch for most of the day. I started reading some posts on here and one comment said to go exercise especially when you are feeling like garbage.

So i got up and ran a mile around the block. When I returned my legs were on fire. I feel like i have pulled both calfs, my knees are both clicking, and my legs are throbbing in pain. I never had this feeing before after running (atleast not this bad) but I did notice something. My withdrawal symptoms practically vanished. It was like the pain in my legs were a build of all the toxicity throughout my body. It basically “hurt so good.”

I’m still pushing through and tomorrow is another day, hopefully for the better. I have a long day ahead of me locked inside my car so I hope my legs relax a bit.

Idk how to explain it but it’s been for about 2 years. I used kratom to quit my 60-90mg oxy a day habit I picked up. It helped the withdrawal and allowed me to sleep a little. But now I feel quitting kratom is harder cause I have nothing to directly help me with it. I’ve been taking about 15-18g a day for the last month or so (before I was doing about 22-28g a day) and this last month has been interesting. I try to drop down every now and then from my 6g per dose to 4-5 (12-15g a day)and the days I try that are miserable, I’m just sweating and almost shaky idk why because it shouldn’t be that much of a difference. I wake up every morning in that cold sweaty restless leg fit until my body gets that first dose in. I just don’t know what to do. 

Also my doctor just diagnosed me with an anxiety disorder and wants me to take an ssri, but I already have low sex drive (idk if it’s from kratom or what it’s from). From what Ive read, ssri’s destroy sex drive which is already hurting my relationship with my girlfriend. I’m not sure if I actually have anxiety or if it’s cause by me trying to quit this stuff or if the kratom has been helping me with an actual anxiety disorder that I’ve been developing while taking it. Like I just feel so stuck and don’t know what to do.

Yesterday evening I was told that they no longer needed me at work. I hadn’t worked there very long, just over a month. This was very surprising because my boss had just been telling me what a good job I was doing, just before I left work on Friday. It wasn’t Kratom related. That was obviously hard news to hear on the third day off this shit. Luckily I didn’t have any thoughts to get more. But this morning I got a call from my old boss asking if I wanted my old job back. Miracle, right? Not exactly. One of the reasons I left that job was because it was a huge trigger for me. I pass two shops where I pick up on the way to work and he isn’t exactly the easiest person to work with, which also became a trigger for me. I asked if I could start work in a few weeks, with the idea that it might be a good idea considering how early on I am in my quit. He agreed.

I was using 30gpd +/- 15g each day for more than two years. I was convinced that stopping would be impossible - the few times that one of my kratom shipments was delayed, the acute withdrawal was absolutely unbearable. I thought I’d be hooked on this drug for the rest of my life, and that made me outrageously anxious. I was terrified of stopping. 

So instead of cold turkey, I opted for a taper. Kratom is not ideal for tapering by any means - the half life is pitiful. I didn’t want to dose more than once a day, so I opted for a single dose right before bed. I immediately dropped to 5 grams, stabilized for a week or so, dropped down to a gram, stabilized for a week or so, dropped to 750mg, wasn’t really able to stabilize and so dropped it altogether. 

Here’s the truth - it’s not much fun. You’re in a perpetual state of *mild* withdrawal. You don’t feel very comfortable, you get exhausted just standing up, your heart pounds sometimes, you have bouts of anxiety, your poop surprises you each day with a new color or consistency, and you’re cranky always. HOWEVER, it is entirely manageable. You may have some sleepless nights - my recommendation? If you’re tossing and turning and anxious, fuck it, grab your laptop and just stay up. One or two all-nighters are better than being alone and uncomfortable for 8 hours with only your thoughts.

The point I truly want to drive home is that IT’S NOT SO BAD. Do not let your fear stop you. Just do it. Reduce the dose as much as possible, as quickly as possible. Let your body define those terms. It is NOT so bad. Push yourself if you can. Say you feel really shitty (I had exactly ONE day of pure hell after stopping altogether. ONE day, that’s it). See how long you can tolerate the feeling. You’ll be surprised - if you just grin and bear it, distract yourself, and hang in there, it’ll be over before you know it. THE FEAR IS WAY WORSE THAN THE EXPERIENCE. 

As I said, I’m two weeks into zero kratom. I still feel cranky and tired and my poop is still weird. I still have restless legs, but the feeling waxed and waned and is not NEARLY as bad as it was in my cold turkey attempts. I highly recommend tapering - yes, you’re stretching out the quitting process by maybe a month, but that means totally manageable withdrawal symptoms spread out, rather than horrible symptoms condensed in a week. If I only tried cold turkey, I’m certain I would have folded after a couple days. I give props to those who can handle it, but this is the only way for me. 

Please ask any questions you may have. I’m happy to discuss any aspect of the process. I wish you all the best and I say again - JUST DO IT!",4,0
426,2020-07-07 11:46:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/hmx01g/independence_day/,Independence Day,"I quit this past Saturday after a quick taper from who knows how much per day to six grams, to four grams, and then jumped. I suppose I had been using (this time) for about a year. Six months the time before and a more than a year the time before that. The first time to quit was brutal as 1) I quit cold turkey, and 2) I had no idea what I was in for. The second time was easier because I tapered and kept my consumption levels low while I was taking. So, when I started this last time I, of course, thought that I could control it....both the consumption and come off....but one pouch turned into two and then three, and so on,  and my trips to the little convenience store had the clerk reaching for a pouch for me as I approached the register. It was clear that I was addicted again.

But the insidious thing about Kratom is that it gives one the illusion of being completely functional: not a problem to work, not a problem to pay bills, not a problem to call my folks on Sundays. The normalcy was on point, except that part of me, the part of me that enjoyed doing things and creating things and searching for things and getting excited about things was dead. I rationalized that maybe being dead to some of these things was ok because of all the insanity in the world, but if you're reading this you know that that is a destructive cop-out. The truth is that the death of mojo (as I call it) begins to spread to other parts of life and you show up late to work, forget a bill and forget your family. A couple of weeks ago I hadn't quite gotten there, but I saw that reality looming on the horizon.

Part of my job is event production so I had to be strategic about when I quit. The upcoming 4th of July seemed logical and metaphorically appropriate, so that was my target. I've read, and believe it to be true, that setting a target is important. If you're planning on dropping off, keep that in mind. 

In preparation for my quit, I stocked up on ashwagandha, vitamin C, 5 htp, Magnesium, and herbal sleep aid. I replaced my Kratom intake on Saturday with the first of those, did my events, and came home and went to bed. Sunday morning I felt a little edgy but kept busy and it passed. I didn't really sleep well either night and had problems sleeping since my taper, but nothing terrible, and, thankfully, no full-blown RLS...I could feel the threat of it, but it never happened.

Yesterday (Monday the 7th), I felt fine until about 11 am when it hit me like a freight train: I was achy, fatigued, dizzy, and restless. I tried to be busy but could do nothing but lay down and listen to audiobooks...rolling in the covers in a feverish state, thoughts racing. Eventually, the GI stuff started, but I embraced it as a guidepost. I embraced it all as the natural progress of escaping the addiction and in a way it was joyful. At some point during the afternoon, I had a feeling or a memory of my old self, the self I had departed from with Kratom and it was like seeing an old best friend after a long absence. It was refreshing.

So, today is Tuesday and I'm at work. I'm not 100%, I've still got my GI issues, but I've not craved anything except a good meal (even though I don't want to eat anything). I imagine and believe that this will be my final experience with Kratom. Life has seasons and this season has ended for me. 

In all of my experiences with ending this particular addiction, this page and its members have been an integral part of helping me muster the courage to quit. I've been lurking around here for a few weeks now, reading your stories, and reading all of the encouragement and love showed by this community to those like me who are/were milling around the edge, contemplating the plunge.

So, thank you to the encouragers. To those hesitating about the quit, you've got it in you to do this. The process might not be glamorous, but it takes courage and fortitude, and finding these things in yourself and employing them to your goals will give you the same rush as climbing a mountain. Sure, it's tough, but you're tougher.  And when you reach the top of the mountain and take that deep breath of fresh air and survey all the possibilities in every direction, you'll be glad and proud you made the effort.

Buy more pills or try this green powder from the smoke shop. I went the green goo route. Been on kratom for 8months now. The most I took was about 25 grams a day  for 3 months (5grams per dose 5 times a day). I've tappered over the last month down to 9gpd ( 3 times a day). I'll be honest, at first I liked it but it got to the point where I was just taking it to preform at work. I don't really think about it much though out the day. Sometimes I would even forget to take it. My main addiction  was Mary Jane. Ive been off that for probably 3 weeks. Shout out to the r/leaves sub. I don't know what to expect and I did take 1 week off work ( self employed) please let me know if their is anything otc that I can take to help with the wd.

Could it be that it’s easier for your body to recover because “bam” now your sick CT and your body knows it needs to recover?

You would think 0.5g a day wouldn’t have any real effect your hormones. Again, it’s probably just because I’ve slowly and gradually taken those habits and mentality into my (almost) sober life.

I was a heavy tramadol and clonazepam user for over a year, and 10-15gpd kratom user for half a year. I decided to meet an addictologist when my depression was starting to get unbearable, and it came from my drug abuse, I knew. My libido was zero, I was a zombie, and on top of that, my gf was using the same drugs, same amount.
The doctor decided to put me on 2mg/day suboxone and I asked that what the fuck? Isn't it a bit overkill to put me on medication heroin users take and such. The doctorcsaid that it isn't because of my nature is too focused on substances and using drugs. And it's true. All my mind is about drugs, my dad, and his dad was a heavy drinker for decades too.
Did any one of you take Suboxone? What are your experiences? 
Footnote: I took my first dose today and I got like reaaaly high, like 3-400mg trams or 7-8gs of kratom, but I feel functional. And I have a chronic leg pain, for that I take Lyrica, which is highly addictive too.

Today is Day 4. 72 hours was at 9 am this morning. Yesterday, after taking a combination of benzos and propranolol, I was able to meet a friend at the beach for about half an hour. But I gotta say, this uneasiness, restlessness, and anxiety are horrific. 

I woke up at 1 am frantically trying to see if I was still anxious, and for a half-hour or so, I felt ok. This morning, however, the anxiety, restlessness, and general feeling of unease are back. At first, I took only propranolol which helped, but I caved and had a benzo just now. 

I have to say I am definitely noticing small improvements, but I am still having diarrhea, so clearly I am not out of withdrawal yet.

It's baffling that this much torture could come from only 16 days of 30gpd followed by 4 days of oxy. I will not be experimenting with opiates again. 

I am just hoping and praying that it gets better and that I am back to feeling calm and normal soon.",1,0

I’ve been using Kratom for roughly 3 years on and off. I started using because I have horrible general anxiety and it helped so much in the beginning. I thought it was some kind miracle leaf that would get me through the rest of my life. This plant has caused me more pain and suffering mentally and physically than any other addiction I’ve had. It’s caused me to not care about anything or anyone around me but when’s the next dose and when do I have to buy more. I was taking about 15+ grams of maenga da a day. It has slowly ruined my sexual relationship with my wife and makes me such an asshole to the people I love the most. 
The longest I’ve quit before was 3 months but I was also on lexapro, which I think actually made everything worse because I was feeling manic. I’m now on day 4 and although my anxiety is through the roof and I’m sluggish, it’s getting better. I also drank the day I quit and on the 4th which I highly do not recommend because I felt horrible yesterday. Although I’m at work today, and I’m a land surveyor so I work outside in the Florida heat, I feel much better than being at my house with nothing to do. I ate breakfast this morning which I almost never do unless I wake and bake because I’m so worried to mess up my dosage. 
I started TRT about 4 weeks ago and I feel it playing a huge part in my PAWS. Last time I quit on day 4 I still felt 100x worse than I do now. I don’t know what my testosterone levels were before Kratom but as of now it is a 1/4 of what is should, and think that played a HUGE part in why my paws were so bad immediately before. I haven’t had any RLS (I was most terrified of this over any other symptoms), and I’ve slept at least 5 hours each night compared to 2-3 before. 
I know each day is going to get better and better.

I had 9 months clean from all drugs and decided i wanted to start using kratom again. Sure enough, the first day i used it, i kept going. For 6 straight months, i was heavily dosing. 3 huge spoonfuls every 6 hours since my high had diminished greatly over the period. Heres my experience with the withdrawals so far.

Day 1- i dosed last night since i could feel me needing it. I woke up feeling pretty shit already but recognized my withdrawals not yet at full swing. I go to work just to be sent home early due to nothing going on so that helps me feel better. It was a hard 5 hrs to work but manageable. I get home, feel like i wanna dose so bad but don't. 

Day 2- now the withdrawals are really kicking in. Sweating, fluctuating body temp(hot, cold, hot, cold), strong body chills, very strong pain throughout my whole body, legs are really hurting the most and cant keep them still. Its like this these whole day. I manage about 3 hrs of sleep.

Day 3- withdrawals are at their worst. Everything i was feeling is amplified by 10x. Except after i wake up, my stomach is upside down and i cant stop my stomach from hurting. I try drinking a smoothie and puke it up immediately. Everything i ate wouldnt stay down. Not even water. Guess i wasn't eating regurlarly while i was using and its noticeable. I get no sleep this night

Day 4- i use my first call in for work. Its not gonna happen today. Over the day, my physical symptoms are now getting better yet it all still hurts a lot. Im actually starting to manage food in my stomach. Mostly egg salad sandwichs and powerade. Easy to swallow and good for digestion and the dehydration. I get about 2-3 hrs of sleep.

Day 5- i wake up feeling withdrawals yet they arent as bad as yesterday. Im still hurting but the pain is better than all the other days. I start being able to talk to people better and feel a little more like my normal self when talking to people. However, the cravings and anxiety are going hand in hand and making it really difficult to wanna do anything but i persist and go on with my day and buy more food at a local supermarket. I get about 5 hrs of sleep.

Day 6-  most of the pain is about gone but feel it slightly. Anxiety and cravings seem alright, dont feel like im gonna break like days 2-4. Occasional cravings and burst of anxiety and random bursts of cold chills mostly but managed to get a full nights sleep(past 6.5 hrs)

Day 7- most of my symptoms of withdrawal are gone but i feel very depressed and anxious. Not the best feeling but i realize the part that hurt the most is over. I didnt sleep to well this night but still got a few hrs.

Day 8- now its just the hard part. PAWS. Feeling overwhelmed in my chest area but not as bad as the anxiety early on. Have occasional cravings but it ain't breaking me. Not feeling depressed much. Mostly just craving and anxiety at this point. I feel so much more better.

Thats my experience so far. Hope this gives people a little info in case they'd like to quit. Its definitely worth it. No one needs to live this way.",7,0

I was taking a pretty high dose 3-4 times a day (4th dose depends on if I can sleep or not) and I would take on average 11-13 G per dose and at night up to 16 to put me to sleep.

Over the last 3 days I have taken around 20 GPD (22 the first day, 20 yesterday and I have one more 6 gram dose to take to make it 18).

I want to stop about here and get my body adjusted over a week or so before doing another big cut, but enough rambling 

Here is my question. I am exhausted.. I'm just tired all the time, my body hurts a little (I have a nerve thing so it's expected)

But I just feel like I haven't slept in a week, and I've been getting 6-7 hours per night.
I've tried caffeine, B12 ect and nadda. I feel like I'm almost swinging though water all day, and from what I've read this sounds normal, but does anyone know of something that MAY help, I gotta be able to work, and at this point I can barely drag myself out if bed. I've been smoking Indica strains to help with the night pain, but I am not one of those people that can function on weed, so for day time stuff im pretty SOL. I've been using ibuprofen and a little excedrin for the joint pain and headaches.

But I just feel like if I would pass out behind the wheel and my job requires me to be mobile. I have one more day off, and I doubt I'll adjust in time.

I feel sick and exhausted but cant always sleep at night. Im afraid this is never going to end. 

I quit Tuesday morning of 1tbsp 4-5 times a day for a year (5 days ago). Towards the end of the few months i used kratom i was extremely depressed. I couldnt do anything and slept most of the day on the couch, even in broad daylight with the tv on. Ever since quitting, ive been depressed about the same amount but i also noticed ive been extremely anxious. This wasnt happening before i quit. Ive always had anxiety, but the kratom must have suppressed it because i rarely felt anxious while using it, just unusually depressed. 

Im sick of feeling this way and i just want to be able to do the things i used to enjoy again. Im on cymbalta but its as if im taking nothing because it stopped working months ago. Not sure if this is because the kratom interfered with it or not. 

Im sure the reason for this depression is screwed up opiod receptors from the kratom, but im getting worried that this is never going to end. People are getting very concerned about me and i am having worse suicidal thoughts. Ive been to the ER already but basically all they could do was check me into a psych ward or detox program and i really didnt want to go through that (ive gone through kratom withdrawal once before back in November, it was also terrible). 

I used ativan for the anxiety for a day from an old prescription but ran out. They will not prescribe me any more because of substance abuse issues and they want me to ""not rely on pills to feel better"", but i have been drinking alcohol a little more lately to suppress the anxiety (not a ton, just a bit to take the edge off, and i have addictive tendencies so i am afraid of developing alcoholism as well-i had alcohol abuse problems when i wad 15 and have had various drug abuse problems since then, including opiods, ativan, xanax, etc.) 

I know that i can never touch kratom again. I messed that up before by going back to it after i was feeling better before. It makes me feel so happy and euphoric at first, but i take so much that i end up sedated and look like a crackhead when im on it. Ive had many people tell me i look sick, pale, like im on drugs, i get tremors, EXTREME constipation (havent shat a good one in 3 weeks now i know tmi)

Ever since i quit i havent been able to sleep during the day anymore. Sometimes not even at night. I feel extremely anxious and moderately depressed. I have worsening suicidal thoughts with a specific plan set out (thats nothing new), i feel faint every time i stand up, my stomach feels sick, most likely from being so constipated im assuming.

I’m currently in the middle stages of my taper, but the major issue is still with my sleep.

Has anyone experienced that ‘reluctance’ to sleep? And this same waking up? I regret this the most from my using, as I feel it’s done harm. 

It hasn’t gotten much better as I’ve cut the amounts gradually. I’m not sure if this is a much longer term problem to resolve.

Days 1-5 were completely substance free and I was starting to feel great, like my old self.  Then I figured Friday to kick off the weekend with 2 beers, telling myself it's ok once a week.  Felt a little less great Saturday, but still managed to play tennis for an hour and felt pretty good.  Then had two more beers yesterday, this time just out of pure boredom.  I got a nice little buzz for about an hour and then had nothing left, so went to bed at like 8:30.  

Woke up today in a funk that I have just not been able to shake.  I don't normally battle with depression, but man, today I feel like such a waste case.  For the past three hours, I've been sitting here, bored and depressed, arguing between ""it's Sunday... you can have a couple more beers before the week starts"" and ""you will probably have twice the regret/depression tomorrow than what you had today.""  I finally made the decision to not go to the liquor store and to just let myself be bored... watch some TV and just veg out, no substance required.  The power I feel from just making that one simple, yet healthy decision has been enough to kick some of the depression.  I feel stronger, accomplished, and funny enough, not *super* bored anymore.  

It's funny as addicts (those of us who are addicts by nature) how smart we can be, yet how silly excuses can easily beat our wits every time... if we let them.  Like I was letting myself think that I was both so bored I had no other choice but to go buy a beer *and* that having a few beers on the weekend was ok... even though I knew it would make me feel like shit shortly after and probably all day tomorrow.  

This post isn't meant as anti or pro alcohol, but if you are an addict like me and you're missing that buzz from something, all you have to do is make one simple decision over and over again and not do what you know will cause you future harm.  I said simple, not easy.  Again, I'm not saying I will be completely abstinent, or that I think that is the only way to go, but if you are like me, you need to know how to learn to tell yourself ""no"" without a substance, exercise, food, whatever.  I mean food and exercise are great, but they only last a short while and at some point, you may feel tempted again.  I hope this helps someone in the future.  I know I just finished searching this sub for something like this myself... because most posts I read were about either people who binge drink, or people who have one beer once a week.  I'm sort of in between- I will not let myself have more than 2-3 a day, but that can easily turn into 2-3 every day if I don't tell myself ""no"" and just let myself be.",11,0

It takes care of you.,"I think we can all agree that this muck wreaks havoc on out entire digestive systems. I'm beginning to believe that this is where a lot of the problems from using/stopping come from. Your gut flora, when not properly balanced can affect your mental, physical, and emotional health, and in my ongoing experience kratom seems to eradicate a lot of the good bacteria in our intestines. This allows undesirable microbes to have more free reign as well. I believe when you stop taking kratom, the gut begins repairing itself, and during this time one will experience what is known as die off, or the herxheimer reaction, aka the healing crisis. Basically, as your gut gets better and kills off and eliminates the bad shit (pun intended) you will feel better before you feel worse. Your body is desperately trying to eliminate the sudden flux of toxins in your body. I believe this is why multiple showers are needed daily as the skin is a great way for the body to eliminate waste. I think this may also be tied in with the hair loss thing. Your microbiome being off can mess with EVERYTHING. I started drinking kombucha daily a month before quitting kratom. It helped a lot. I highly suggest reading into probiotics, gut health, and the herxheimer reaction. I'd like to say more right now, but I'm busy. Feel free to AMA or add suggestions.

Edit: I find the best way to deal with die off is drinking ridiculous amounts of water. Showering, brushing, and flossing also are monumental.",16,0

I wake up without that heavy hungover feeling. I can get through my mornings without the crazy heavy crash I used to get after my first dose. I end up being present in social settings and actually enjoying myself for the most part. I no longer binge eat carbs when I have a low blood sugar crash.

So far I had muscle aches but they seem to have got better. I'm still having to run to the bathroom, but have had no nausea or vomiting.

I managed to stay clean until 2019.

A friend of mine offered me a 'total safe' herbal tea that makes you feel chilling. It was kratom red thai. I immeditely fell in love. I used it for 9 months. Deep down, I know something wasn't right because my behavior started to look like what I had been doing my whole life before I went into rehab. Lying about my use. Obsessively using it. Driving a lot of miles just to have stash. I felt very trapped.

In february, I went cold turkey. Honestly, it was one of the hardest things I ever done in my life. I had some benzo help for the first days. I wouldn't have made it.  


As from february until may, i was clean.

Then, during lockdown, i started using again. I felt trapped at home, and I guess I wanted something to relieve myself. I immediately felt I was going back to the dark side, so i quit on thursday evening. It is now saturday afternoon. I can't say it's easy.

Go for it”. She took it out to the trash bin. A minute later I went out there because I wanted it to be gone for good, and I wanted to see it destroyed. I opened up the kratom bag itself, took a whiff of the nasty plant matter, gagged, and dumped it out. So long green powder!

I know it’s a daunting task to make the decision to quit. The fear is often worse than the withdrawals. This community is incredibly helpful, and I could not have made it to day 59 without the support of so many people here. 

There is one thing I want to point out. Those who have a much easier time quitting kratom are probably less likely to:
1. Join a community like r/quittingkratom
2. Share their experiences, especially over weeks/months 

Yes, there are lots of people who really struggled quitting kratom, including myself. But if you’re browsing through stories and posts like I did, you are likely getting a skewed view of the process. A person who struggled is probably more likely to post here than someone who quit with relative ease. 

This is NOT to downplay kratom withdrawal or PAWS. It is different for every person, and those who went through hell deserve respect.

Your experiences are your experiences. Kratom withdrawal depends on countless factors, including dose, frequency, length of use, strain, etc. PAWS is even more complex, and your mental health and other psychosocial factors play a role as well. 

While every case is different, there are some basic things you can do to make this process easier:

Stay active. It might be exhausting at first, but exercise is incredibly important. 

Stay hydrated and eat a well balanced, healthy diet

Supplements: Many have had luck with magnesium, high doses of liposomal vitamin C, melatonin for sleep, valerian root for anxiety, and several others. 

Meds: consider talking to your doctor about clonidine (sedating/ great for sleep and RLS also helps with chills) and gabapentin. 

You will get through this. Embrace the unpredictability. You are going on a journey. Nothing is certain, but that you will grow and learn from the experience.",25,0

I know there are a ton of these posts, but they helped me, so I'd like to try to return the favor.

I used kratom fairly continuously for a few years, a few spoonfuls per day. I quit for a month or so once, and felt waayy better, but relapsed. I don't even know why, because for the majority of the time I used kratom I didn't even notice much benefit. All I know is I would get a craving for it, then go buy some more.

When I used kratom, I became numb emotionally. I was content to just sit around, sip kratom, and watch TV. I noticed I became awkward socially. I didn't care as much about people or what they were saying. I even noticed that it became harder to make facial expressions; it was hard to smile, which is so fucked up.

I didn't really feel bad or good about anything, just neutral, blah. Which makes sense considering kratom is mostly an opioid partial agonist.

I finally decided to quit for good about three weeks ago. The first few days I had some cravings, nothing too terrible. The first 10 days or so I felt lethargic, bored, completely unmotivated. One day I just lied down face first on my bed for hours; I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do.

Then, slowly, I started to fill my day with positive activities. I started exercising again -- running, weightlifting, and I even played basketball for the first time in years, something I used to do daily. I've cleaned up my apartment, I've been cooking more, I knocked out a bunch of errands that had piled up. I was proactive about reaching out to friends and meeting up with them, and when I did I felt more engaged, more socially capable. I have a first date in a few days. My sleep is waaayyy better now. Some people say kratom helps them sleep, but that wasn't the case for me, even with ""sedating"" reds.

Altogether, the benefits I have seen from quitting kratom are pretty much exactly what it looks like when someone recovers from depression. I didn't really consider myself depressed before, but I was certainly worse off than I am now.

Whether binge drinking and smoking weed in my teens and college years, taking adderall, experimentation with mdma, psychedelics and opioids, I constantly wanted to not be sober. It wasn’t until daily use of kratom that I experienced true addiction and withdrawal. It is so easy to see how it happens now. I understand how overdoses happen and people plan their lives around substances. If you could die from too much kratom, I would be dead.

One night last week, while trying to sleep, I realized this had to stop. What started as 10 grams once a day after work, grew into four or five shots of extracts a day, supplemented by powder in between.

There’s no way I could handle CT and the PAWS that come with it, so I am determined to taper.",9,0

Does LDN completely stop withdrawals? Am I still going to go through withdrawals and it just shortens the duration?

How long after my last dose before I can start it?

I will also need instructions for mixing the recommended dosage….

My thinking was “It was a piece of cake the first time around. I can do this again, no problem.” I’m sure you know where this is going. For whatever reason, the withdrawals are pretty bad and start within six hours of last dose.

I’ve quit so many times but for some reason this time I’m really scared. This time really feels like the last. I probably say that every time but there is something different. 
One reason I’m nervous is that I don’t want my husband to suspect I’m detoxing. He knows I’ve struggled with it in the past but he doesn’t know I’ve been taking it. Usually when I detox I tell him I have a bug but this time I won’t be doing that. With all the corona stuff I don’t want there to be unnecessary concern. 
The other reason I’m nervous is that I have things planned to keep me busy but they are going to be challenging to do while detoxing. I hope I haven’t overcommitted and I really don’t want to ruin the holiday weekend with my family. 
Even though I’m scared I am excited as well. Thanks to this group I know that no matter what happens it will be okay and I will make it. If I have to tell my husband I will. If I can’t do the things I planned it’s okay. The most important thing is that I get better.

It’s hard for me to estimate how much kratom I was taking bc I would buy it in tea form a lot of the time but I also would get capsules. I estimate that I was taking at least 15 - 20 g a day for the last 5 months. I should note that immediately prior to starting the kratom use I was abusing my vyvanse prescription but thankfully I’ve gotten past that and I don’t take vyvanse anymore. My main question is whether my withdrawal symptoms should be this dramatic? I’m getting very anxious wondering if everything is happening more or less predictably or if there is something else wrong with me. 

For the first 36 hours I pretty much just wanted to sleep all day. This was followed by about 5 days where I was super high energy, even euphoric. I had restless legs during this. On day 7(yesterday) I felt less euphoric and suddenly started feeling like I was dissociating from everything around me. This feeling of depersonalization as well as brain fog has been very alarming and has continued until today. I’m now also starting to feel pretty depressed and anxious. The euphoria was surprising to me but so is the fact that it’s taken until day 8 for me to feel any depression.

If you were dependent on one capsule per day, you get a noticable buzz and your pupils constrict in opioid fashion and had been taking 2 doses of 1 capsule per day spread by 8-12hrs up until a few days ago but you're steady at 1, what kind of WD would you be looking at? You'd been taking 2 a day for two months on most of the days of the week. Let's say 4 to 5 days a week and 1 of them on the other days.

I'll just call them gold bought from a headshop. There's 2 brands of those where I live, so lets say it's the stronger one. When I went from 2 to 1 per day, I'd start the day pretty lethargic, some occasional sneezes, near sight reading vision kinda blurry, typical opioid WD symptoms but nothing like rampant diarrhea and stomach aches, some noticable depression etc.

I've WD from opioids after heavy use when I was younger and know how to gauge severity, I also used to take these up to 5 at a time for a few months a couple years ago, lol. Crazy, I know. No worries on that happening again because I was naive back then and know how physicallly addictive it is now. There's not much of a psychological thing going on, I don't fiend for it or think about it constantly. It's more like I know I'll need to take it to be in a good mood and feel 100+%.

The buzz I get might be comparable to a few hydrocodone or percocet. Anyways, if you had to make an educated guess, roughly how many grams of kratom per day in one dose do you think one of those capsules equals to in alkaloid content? How many days do you think I'd feel pretty shitty if I just stop? That's the plan after 1 per day for a couple more days. My body is still used to 2 per day 4-5 days out of the week so I want to adjust.

My apologies if this sounds like next to nothing compared to other kratom habits but it's been fucking with me mentally and it's too expensive to spend $300 a month on.",1,0

Taper method and what I gained back.,"Like many of you I got into it to escape another thing. I was in pain and my gf just broke up with me and I’d found this made me not wanna drink all my sorrows away. Then the downsides started hitting...sweating like crazy especially in my sleep, absolutely soaking my sheets. I have never liked CT and always had a decently strong constitution so I decided to taper. 

It took me over a year to get to this level of addiction, I allowed myself to not get angry at myself and understand that it was going to take some time getting off it. 

I never timed my dose but I knew I usually did 3tsp each time with the 3rd tsp not filling up the spoon all the way. That was my sweet spot. So I put me at 3 doses a day, 2 1/2 tsp each dose. The idea was to try to get to dosing twice a day first. 

By now my skin looked like shit, people straight up thought I looked like a dead man walking and I grew tired of looking so tired. 

I did get irritable. I stayed away from loved ones but besides that I felt just fine and dandy...just oddly irritable at the DUMBEST things. I blew up on my dad once for eating a can of my beans! I have to chuckle at myself for that one and don’t worry, me and pops are tight. 

So one dose in the morning, afternoon and night. I started stretching out the second dose to get it closer and closer to the 3rd dose till I was dosing twice a day. From there I started dosing the last one later and later at night till I got it down to one dose every 24 hours. 

By that time, my sleep started coming back, i was on only 2 1/2 tsp a day and still hadn’t felt any huge withdraw effects. The bags under my eyes went away and I started getting compliments on my looks and skin especially. There are definitely times though where you need to be tough when stretching out your doses. I definitely felt what y’all are talking about but only had to endure those feelings for a few hours and then my next dose would be there to reel me in. This is why I preferred the taper method over CT. I didn’t have 3 weeks to just feel like shit. 

Once I got to one dose a day I started extending that dose past 24 hours for as long as I could. Went down to 2tsp and 35 hours. Then 48 hours, then 1tsp every 48 hours and then just stopped. 

Tapering works but I understand some people don’t have restraint and can’t do this method but for the ones that can I urge you to try it this way. 

Others things that helped: keep a fan on you while you sleep, weighted blanket for legs, find a game or TV series to dive into, eat right, chug water, take melatonin and Benadryl for sleep, exercise and lift heavy weights, smoke some weed (I used very little at night but seemed to help knock me out)",17,0

About 11 hours ago, I hit my 2-year anniversary of quitting this stuff. I first found kratom following multiple surgeries and prescribed pain-killers. Doctors took away the pain killers before I was ready. And voila...enter kratom! For about 7 years I relied on kratom, to relive pain, then to feel normal. I quit a few times, then used again...then quit again...used again...until July 1, 2018, when I finally said goodbye ugly weed!

So I know y'all are gonna ask how I did it. I went cold turkey. I tried tapering several times but had no willpower. So CT it was. I live in the midwest united states and it's really hot this time of year. So I took a week off work (which was easy because I'm self-employed), and spent long days doing yardwork, and sweating buckets, with sheets of sweat flowing down my face. Sounds gross, but it was quite cleansing. Oh, and I drank lots of water, and took lots of showers. At night, I found some Netflix series to keep my mind off the horrible acute withdrawals...then took benedryl and melatonin to get just a few hours of sleep. Then the next morning...back out in the yard I went...more sweat, more water, etc.

When all was said and done, my yard looked great! Got a few home repairs done too.

The first week was hell. Brain fog, flu-like symptoms, RLS at night. Digestive system was way out of whack (and that lasted several months). Everything else seemed to end in its own time. Second week was a bit easier. And the third even easier. I guess it was about 2 or 3 months later until I felt I was out of the woods. It was mostly a blur back then.

What worked? Sweat Therapy (as mentioned above). I also took black-seed oil for the general malaise...and magnesium supplements for the RLS. Not sure how effective it was, but I do believe it helped a bit, compared to previous quits when I didn't use the supplements. I tried to eat somewhat healthy, although I wasn't really hungry...

Also, toward the end of my quit...I discovered CBD. At the time CBD was fairly new to the market, but now it seems more available. It helped immensely with the anxiety. I still use it to this day, although not as frequently as I did during kratom withdrawal.

I found great comfort in this board, and wrote much more often, and received great support from others going thru the horrible experiences of quitting kratom.

Keep the faith folks, and keep fighting the good fight. Kratom additiction is fully conquorable. If I can do it, so can you.

Do I sometimes have cravings, and want to use again? Uh Yeah! But  I always remind myself that the pain I went thru back in 2018 isn't something I want to do again. Meditation and prayer helps now. I hope each of you can find the strength to do what I did. I wish I'd have done it much sooner, because life is so much better on this side of kratom addiction!",48,0

I quit Kratom almost a month (26 days to be exact) ago. I quit because I started experiencing hair loss, something quite traumatic because I am only 18. The hair loss started suddenly but kept getting worse and worse 3 days after I realized. After quitting, I kept waiting and waiting but the hair loss didn’t slow down. After about a week it seemed to slow down, but then it got worse. This cycle continued 2 more times until now. It is really bad currently, and I am super embarrassed because it is quite noticeable now. It makes me want to not leave my house, which is extremely frustrating because I’ve been holed up for 2 months and they are just loosening COVID restrictions. I’m experiencing really bad depression and I can’t tell if it’s because of the hair loss or PAWS. I’m going off course, my question is has anybody experienced hair loss long after quitting Kratom? If so please let me know what happened. Thanks.

I had quit for a month in December. Caved and started periodically like most thinking I had control. I didn’t but I was able to quit to go to Mexico for 9 days without any issue even being around 20gpd at that time. I should have stayed away and after my first quit and my wife finding some in April, things were bad. During quarantine we got really stale and she asked for time and space to do our own things end of May and all of June. Things had been getting better but I started using Kratom while things weren’t good and last few days things were looking up and I’ve been trying to taper off 15-20gpd but she found some yesterday. I thought it was the end. Some miracle, even though she is mad, she is going to support me to kick this. I can’t do this anymore to her or my kids. She is perfect and way out of my league and I can’t believe I’ve fucked things up again on this shit. I want to be clean for her, for my 2 young kids and for myself.  I had problems with drinking 4 years ago so it’s been a lot of things. She Isn’t promising we’re not getting divorced after all is said and done but she is sticking by me for now. 

My plan was to finish a hard taper but I haven’t had any for almost 24 hours. That all too familiar feeling is there in my body wanting to take more. I have Canada day off today followed by Thursday and Friday off for 5 days here where I can keep busy and not be sitting at my work desk thinking about how I’m feeling. Should I try to stick out the CT here now or should I keep up with the taper? I have some Mertazapine I had been taking before to help with depression and sleep so I will use that too. If anyone could help me out that would be awesome! I need to kick this!",3,1

I really dont know what to think about it. My days mainly consist of anhedonia but i see improvements here and there. Some days i had things switched on in my brain and i felt pure life and joy for some hours. I could watch some movies without that tension in my stomach and felt so good. Is this going to wait me in the end or is its just some overcompensation of the brain? I hope not...

Since i was anxious my whole life i dont even know what waits me however since i used kratom (7 years not daily) i solved a lot of problem in my life, so it should be better...

I am considering trying to have someone design a methadone regimen that will taper me into sobriety. I have tried tapering myself with kratom and I honestly don’t have the discipline. My goal is to spend as little time as possible on methadone. I’ve seen guys go to methadone clinics for years. I’m not sure if this is realistic, but I’d like to only have to go to the methadone clinic for a month or maybe even less. Does anyone have any insights on this? How efficient is a methadone tapering regimen for actually quitting opiates?",1,0

I circled the date on the calendar, tapered halfheartedly and never looked back. It was not easy for the first month but it is simple. Make the choice. Do whatever it takes. Do not pick up. If you have reservations about quitting then you may not be ready. My personality is back as though my lens were foggy for so long. I feel emotions and I genuinely care about others instead of just myself. I now know that I experience anxiety more than I thought but it comes in a wave, I do not feed the anxiety and it rolls out. I do not reach for other substances to fill the void. I was camping this last weekend and thought about all the times I would make a k-drink before bed on the stove because the minute I wake up I needed it and didn’t want to fumble with stove.

The first 7 days I had a lot of restlessness and RLS. I tried everything natural until day 8 I took my prescription Oxycodone as I had a flare up and my back was really bad. Probably to do with how tense I was with little sleep. The withdrawal symptoms went away and I was able to sleep. Yesterday morning was the last time I took the pain medication. 

Last night I slept from 6pm - 830am. Lol. I was exhausted. And felt like crap. (Runny nose extreme fatigue.

You know, I quit last year on the same day. I only lasted three months. I made too many changes at once, broke up with my BF of four years, and I used it as an excuse to relapse. I’m finally over him, and the 8 months it took, really don’t feel like 8 months at all. 

It’s funny, life was like “oh. Well now you have to WD during a pandemic too,” there really is no good time to stop, except NOW. I could have saved so much money, but on the bright side, I didn’t go back to using as much I did last time, but if I continue, I’m sure I’ll be there in no time.

What helped me last time, was being on here. Talking to you all, chilling in the chat constantly. I worked out often, ate healthy (keto diet really helps with emotions and energy, planning to go back to that), meditation outside for 5 minutes every day (I use “honest guys” for guided meditation on YouTube) wrote in journal, therapy (which I’m still in), attempting to stay busy,

So would I still need supplements to withdrawal if I’m about to just stop taking kratom? I do get that runny nose, so is the black seed oil pills what I need? I also have tons of turmeric I’ll be using, and of coarse magnesium. Don’t ever give up guys! For all of us who have to start over, we are here to show others that you can start over, and do it all again.

From this list, it's up to u to responsibly come up with a plan that works for you, or do your own research to find what works. Write it out and stick to it. Gather what you need. And THEN get sober. Set yourself up for success. Just getting sober isnt enough though- you'll also need to be taking care of yourself and doing work on you. Journal, work a program, exercise, help others, meditate, eat regularly, find your passions. Good things come with sobriety! I'm 65 days sober and it just gets better and better!
