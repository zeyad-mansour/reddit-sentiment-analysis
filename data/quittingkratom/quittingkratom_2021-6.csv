I was addicted to kratom for almost 4 years, taking around 60-80gpd (an estimate but I'm not 100% sure, I stopped tracking or measuring my doses towards the end). I had tried to quit multiple times but the withdrawals always hit me hard around the 3 day mark and I would end up ordering more. 

I finally made the decision to quit for good after realizing how far forward with my mental health I was moving, and how kratom was truly the last thing holding me back. I originally wanted to go CT but decided to try tapering with capsules instead after 4 days of not sleeping. 

I ordered 200 caps (unsure of the dosage of them unfortunately, but they were size 000 caps) and planned a taper over 2 weeks or so. I started with 15 caps a day taken at 3 different times, and did that for a week. Then I reduced it to 5 2x a day for 7 days, then only 2 right before bed for the remainder of my caps. I experienced almost no withdrawal symptoms throughout the entire taper, only having slight digestive issues after I reduced the dosage down to 2 caps a day. 

I've been a month clean now and I truly never believed that I would be able to do it. I feel so free, I suddenly have energy to go out again, I don't feel the need to rush home immediately after work so that I can dose again, the lack of motivation and energy I've experienced over the last few years is gone. I haven't even thought about Kratom except in brief moments where I remember how addicted I used to be. 

The only lingering effect I have is issues with my bowel movements, but I'm guessing it will take quite a while for my digestive system to recoup after the amount of K I put into it over the years. I'm so thankful for this community in offering me hope & support, along with the guy who suggested I use caps to taper because I don't think I would've been able to quit otherwise!",22,0

I am extremely fatigued and lethargic all of the time. And I constantly think about having it with me at all times just in case. I am scared I won’t be able to taper, however, I’m really considering buying more so that I can taper because I have to work all week and today was already very rough. My emotions have been very intense, my mind going to dark places, skin crawling, and very high anxiety. Does anyone have any advice.

It looks like a lot of people have been taking much higher dosages than me and that’s completely understandable. I’ve been taking ~6-10 krave capsules per day for a few months and I’m wondering if folks here think that’s enough to justify a full-blown taper. 


I noticed the taper relies on pure powder and since I take capsules, I’m just trying to figure this out. I have job interviews currently (tech stuff) and really don’t want to destroy myself in the process. That said, I really don’t want to dig myself any deeper in this stuff and want to get away from it.

Now, it's gotten worse and I am not able to go to the toilet anymore, which is why I was hospitalized. Even most laxatives don't help, only the most extreme ones.

Thus, the time has come.
Or rather, the time had come all along, but now it is so obvious that even an idiot like me can see it.

I took about 30-40 gpday for 2-3 years. (less in the beginning of course)

I have instantly reduced it to 20.
That was easy, because the rest I didn't ""need"" anyway, I just did it out of boredom mostly.
So, reducing that is nothing yet.
Went from 20 to 19 in 2 days. Tomorrow 18.

I plan to reduce it relatively quickly to at least 15, then if possible 10, then even a bit lower before jumping. (I might change the details a bit, eg jumping earlier if 10 or so is hell already, or jumping later if it works quite well (yeah, like it will...))

I will finally tell my gf aswell. I won't make it without her. 

I will update/reply to this post.

Wish me strength, fellow fighters.

P.S.: Not too important, but while I'm at it, two questions: 1) is there actually anyone here who quit K and has gone to at least 80-90% of how it was before? It sometimes feels like everyone is at day 60 or so, but still depressed and having zero energy all the time.
2) what can you recommend as helpers for this hard time? I will NOT use anything that's even close to be called a drug ever again.
But maybe vegetables, oils, or harmless medicaments. I want to buy it asap so I have it when I jump, at the latest.

I might say some irrelevant information but it'll feel good to get it out since I've always been so hush hush about this.

So yeah, It started when a coworker introduced me to it in the early summer of 2019. I got into it with very little knowledge of the addiction and withdrawals from kratom. I quit from some point in early February to sometime in June 2020. I finally quit when i started a temporary job in February. But went back to my old company soon after and eventually the same coworker came and worked with me again. He was telling my boss how much better my performance was when I was on it so my boss pressured me to try it and I wanted to impress everyone so I caved again. I then used it from June 2020 until about late January of this year. When I quit in late January 2021 i was clean until late March of 2021 and my girlfriend was so proud of me..  she doesn't know I started again in March though and I've been hiding it. Finally in March I entered my finals for school and bought only 20 grams to increase mental performance and I slipped from there and have been using it ever since. So in short I've been using it for 3 months. I was planning on quitting this long weekend for Canada day since my girlfriend was leaving for work for the weekend. But she caught me using it yesterday and absolutely freaked out. I then dumped out over 200 grams and I'm going cold turkey. I had my last dose this morning. My dose is about 6 grams or so and I do it about 2 times a day.

Tl;Dr I used kratom for about 8 months, quit, can't remember how long withdrawals lasted for. I quit for about 4 months and then got back on it for about 7 months. I again, can't remember how long it lasted for... maybe 2-3 weeks that time around? That was heavy heavy doses, like 20 grams a day.  I've now been on it for 3 months at the most and I'm going cold turkey as of this morning. I'm currently 6 hours past my last dose. This time I got back into kratom (3 months at the most) I do about 12-16 grams a day. I'm under way more stress this time around so I really want to know from experience, if anyone can relate close to my dose and time on it, how long I can expect withdrawals to last for. Basically, how long can I expect withdrawals to last for, for a person using for 3 months and about 12-16 grams a day. Sometimes only 6 a day. Like once every 2 weeks. With experience of longer term use.

20,2021-06-29 14:44:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/oaeiu3/ptsd_and_struggling/,PTSD and Struggling,"Hey yall,

Long post alert - I just kind of need someone to vent to. As I mentioned yesterday, I decided a rapid taper would be best for me given I had about a 70 gpd habit going for ~8 months. Sunday was 64g, Monday 54g, and today will be no more than 44g. It feels good to be making concrete progress and sticking to a regime, but I psychologically feel awful. 

I’m guessing it’s a combo of the withdrawal and ptsd, each exacerbating the other. I believe I mentioned familial issues re: my younger brother’s wedding to karen meets bridezilla in late July. Now normally I’d be like “yay, travel on the parents’ dime and pics for the ‘gram,” but given my brother (and father’s) complete lack of awareness/concern over my complex PTSD (basically, there was an intervention that resulted in my being assaulted by a strange male interventionist my dad hired followed by a month of starvation and catching covid at rehab, returning home and sustaining a concussion thanks to covid delirium, having hallucinations, and spending 5 nights in a psych ward only to be sued by a rogue nurse for battery when I was completely unconscious thanks to haldol and ativan). The logic of my father and brother has been “she’s an addict, she deserved it” when the toxicology report showed not even kratom or alcohol was in my system at the time of the incident. It was a mere coincidence.

So late last week, my brother shows up unannouced, and little did I know how serious my ptsd would become, esp while tapering from kratom. My question for my fellow swamp monster killers is as follows:

1) Do I play along like I’m going to the wedding to keep the peace when my brother (the militaristic type, literally) is home, or do I simply set clear boundaries (ie, the wedding will likely cause me a full blown kratom relapse and additional PTSD plus my brother never personally invited me) from the get go?

I have hit rock bottom and am absolutely paralyzed. It’s like my body is in complete shock. I am dreading this wedding and being around my brother’s materialistic, judgmental friends and don’t feel like it’s fair for my father to force me to go.

Sorry for the rant. I am in a very dark place mentally, can’t find a therapist, and am absolutely paralyzed over here. Yall are all I’ve got and I am so grateful this forum exists.",4,2

Here is a quick rundown of my story. I'm taking 60 grams per day and have been at this dose for over a year. My kratom addiction started just over 2 years ago. I was hooked after the first dose, and started to recognize withdrawal symptoms after taking kratom daily for 2 weeks (small doses at first). Over time, my tolerance has grown and I steadily increased my doses from 2 gpd to 60 gpd. I have been trying to quit now for 18 months. I have tried everything, and done a shit ton of research, only to end up in the same place as I started. I have tapered more than 6 times, went cold turkey more than 10 times, and even went to rehab. I've gotten to the point that I'm so exhausted from the pain and misery of this addiction, and how difficult it has been trying to taper/cold turkey. It's physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting. I have lost all my will power to even try and quit anymore. I have no motivation. I feel like a failure, because I have failed OVER AND OVER to quit kratom. My parents payed thousands for me to go to rehab, and I didn't last more than 9 days there. I gave it everything I had and tried so fucking hard, but I still failed. I even considered going on Suboxone to get off kratom. I'm so glad that I didn't though, because I now know it's much worse of an addiction. When I went to rehab, they gave me suboxone on a 5-day taper schedule. It worked fantastic actually, completely fixed my withdrawals. I felt normal again for the first time in a long time, and I actually thought I was going to get clean. After the suboxone taper ended, I got extremely ill. The withdrawals from that were worse than the kratom withdrawals! I have never felt so sick in my entire life. Even worse than going through labor with my son. I made it through 3 days of that, and then checked myself out because I couldn't do it anymore. At this point, I still desperately want to quit, but I have no will power left. I'm so depressed, I don't leave the house, and I'm terrified i'm going to be like this forever.

It has now been 8 days and I've experienced no physical withdrawal symptoms. It actually makes no sense, because I've tried quitting several times and within 6 hours I was already in agony. Didn't even take time off for work either. I think the big secret is that I've started exercising a lot. I have a gym membership now and started lifting, also starting to cook my own meals instead of getting takeout all the time. If you're struggling with CT, the sidebar isn't joking that exercise is the #1 relief for withdrawal symptoms. I think the key is to keep yourself busy. I felt a bit too restless to sit down with a book for the first few days but now I'm reading again. 

The worst symptom I've gotten is that I yawn more than usual, and sometimes I will get cravings that last a few seconds. But I can't believe I made it this far. Good luck to the rest of you.",6,0

I’ll never be able to live in anything but a pod at this point, I destroyed my potential. I spent my youth being anxious and depressed and now that I feel true anxiety and depression I wish I never fooled myself into thinking I was actually sad all those years ago and self medicated

I have no idea how I overlooked this during my years of use, I used to see the posts about heavy metals found in Kratom but I never paid much attention to them, never bothered looking up symptoms. I’m sure a lot was denial, who knows. Last night I was getting overwhelmed while seeing all the symptoms . I am 100 certain I have heavy metal poisoning, and it says it can take years for small amounts to build over time and eventually causing the symptoms, which may not be detected in tests. While on Kratom there were times I had become really sick, high fever for days. At that point I believe I was reaching very toxic/fatal levels of poisoning. I’m on day 48 now and I’m still dealing with many of the symptoms. I did order a detox for lead poisoning last night to help flush it out of my body. It says it can be out of the blood within a month and out of soft tissue and organs in 2 months, but it can stay in your bones for 25-30 years. My teeth have been effected by it as well. 

I felt like that weight came crashing back down while reading about all of this, I also was looking up symptoms of kidney disease. Those symptoms all align as well.

I went cold turkey. It was hell. After thinking about how often I was buying kilos, I'd realized it had been a while since it was anywhere near 14/day. I was doing 50g+ for months. The 14-21g days were years prior. Again, I never really pay attention to time. Working from home makes it mostly irrelevant in the long-term.

Dropping off of that was crap. Nausea, normal pains amplified like a bus hit me, flu-like fever feeling, falling asleep constantly for short periods, RLS, insomnia to where if I was in bed for 10 hours I was lucky to have actually slept 2-3 I woke so much. All loperamide did was either 1) nothing at lower doses or 2) make my stomach hurt like hell at higher doses. Nothing helped.

After a bit I gave up mentioning I'm epileptic. Insomnia + epilepsy = hospital or worse when it's night after night. We'll leave that long-story-short.

After picking it back up again I kept it between 15-25g without any discomfort. Quit for a small period, started again at 12-17g/day averaging 15g. At this point when I quit CT there wasn't a lot of discomfort. Mild pain, no feverish feeling, only fell asleep a couple times a day, some fatigue but still restless at night enough to be bothersome.

Since then I've tapered down to a constant 6-8g a day. The past few days have been no more than 6. There's enough to do two more of 6.

Below 6 is too hard. It wears off too fast. It's like if I try to do less during the day, I wind up doing more because I'm getting so tired. At this amount my sleep also isn't great.

I suppose what I'm really aiming for here is if you all (assuming you've been through a similar pattern) think it's better to keep on 6g/day for another week and let my body adjust to that or just go CT. I'm not sure if getting myself more accustomed to 6/day will soften the blow of stopping as it's barely been over a week since it was 15 or so.

Input appreciated! This stuff is getting old.

It seems like it’s been a year, but also like a day? Time’s weird. The first week was as expected. Uncomfortable, unable to sleep, no motivation or energy. Weeks 2-3 were a hard march through PAWS, feeling like I’d take a step forward and two steps back every day. Then last week I began a new job and the excitement and novelty kept me so busy and distracted I didn’t realize just how “normal” I was feeling.

This weekend my girlfriend and I went to an engagement party for some friends of hers back in her home state. It’s the kind of situation where I went in with mild social anxiety, because I’d only know 5 or 6 people out of the 50 or so that would be there. Rather than self-medicating, I was able to just BE THERE. I danced, made jokes, met new people without any self-consciousness, and I had a great time. My girlfriend even pulled me aside after a few hours and told me “You’ve been YOURSELF so much today. I’ve enjoyed being with you so much.” 

Now, we’ve had some struggles recently, and my initial motivation for quitting was being able to see how it was affecting her. To hear her say that and realize it myself was such an empowering moment. 

To those in the beginning stages, do whatever you need to do to make it through the next minute. The next 10 seconds. There’s not a right or wrong way. Whatever gets you to wake up the next morning without using is the “right way.” Because it’s temporary. It gets better. It gets easier. Your brain remembers how it’s supposed to work. It remembers how it’s supposed to motivate you to do the things that are good for you. And pretty soon you’ll be looking back and you’ll think “how the FUCK was I able to convince myself I was a functioning addict??”

I'm ready to quit but I'm scared as hell..I take 2 of those tinctures once in the morning, once at night, (sometimes 3) a day and I get a high, but then I'm absolutely exhausted afterwards. I have also been taking 10-30 pills at various times during the day (12-25 Grams?) after the shots to keep somewhat level, but they don't really do much anymore. I'd say about 15+ Grams capsules to the two shots.


My bank account has been depleting, my energy is depleting and with the recent stomach issues and a talk with a friend, I'm terrified but I want to stop. I've never posted in here before so I do need advice...


The tinctures, I take at least 2 full bottles (2 shots a day). I think my tolerance is so high now that the capsules are basically useless. I'm not sure where to start but I do know I want to start.

I've heard horror stories about withdrawal and I'm not sure I am ready to face that yet. Is there any hope for me?

Im currently down from 20g a day to about 5g a day. I have quit completely in the past, a fees times. But always come back during anxious times. However, I’m finding at around 5g a day my brain is finally coming out of a trance or fog that I don’t realize I enter when taking Kratom daily. The anxiety/depression reduction from Kratom is nice at first, but it’s not worth this “fog”.  I never realize it until I lower my dosage a lot, which is when it becomes clear. The clarity is so good and freeing! I know that If I took like a one time 10g dose, all these revelations are quickly subsided, and anything I want to do to better myself (like working out) will take a back seat and not be significant at all, because the Kratom had made me feel so good, that I don’t think I need the exercise anymore. It happens quick, and it’s dangerous. Hope this helps someone.",5,0

I was starting to resign myself to just being addicted forever.

Nothing makes me addicted like k and prescription opiates. I can handle alcohol, benzos in moderation NP. But this is also not my first rodeo when it comes to quitting kratom. First, second, and third quits were a breeze between subs (rapid taper), clonodine, gabapentin, and phenobarbital (rehab only with this last drug).

Now I’m quitting for a myriad of reasons - it’s not helping my PTSD any more, I’ve lost too much weight, money, secrecy, and my brother’s wedding is out of state July 22-26. I guess I could bring some extract capsules in case of emergency, but I so want to be done, be normal.

I remembered this one friend mentioning his wife’s mom getting clean from xanax with cbd. Didn’t believe it bc cbd does nothing for me, but when I learned about D8 I decided to try to add it to my arsenal:

10 5 mg valiums
20 400 mg gabapentins
A bottle of black seed oil
Natural Calm Magnesium supplement
2-4 sativa gummies, 25 mg each during the day (D8) and a 75 mg indica at night.

I was just taking the valium (which I break in halves) and gabapentin when the mental part gets unbearable. But now with the D8 edibles, I don’t feel like I’m crawling out of my skin and I stop hating myself (I’m not depressed medically, but I have chronic ptsd and that is my biggest trigger). One of my baking customers has been sober for 28 years and while alcohol is not my problem (ED survivor who still struggles), I feel like she came to me for a reason. I might ask her if she’s sponsoring people independently. Like me, she doesn’t subscribe to the AA approach (great if it works for you - no judgment!)

Yesterday was my last shot binge day ever. Two today then one the last days of June. Come July I will max take 4.5 mg capsules when I wake up and jump since capsules are nothing on the extracts.

Tl; dr (lawyer problems) - I struggle a l with the mental aspect of w/d. The D8 seems to be doing something. I’m not baked, totally just accepting this is gonna suck but I must do it. I appreciate any advice or feedback from my fellow quitters - godsend.",6,0

You can click my profile and see a few of the quits. In total I’ve probably tried to seriously quit 10 times?  Crazy to think about honestly. This time I’m using some helper meds which I’ll get into (clonidine {#1 helper}, some muscle relaxer, and weed) 


Been using for 5-6 years (not sure) daily use with a handful of breaks when attempting to quit.  2020/2021 has been the hardest for me in regards to quitting because of the damn concentrates. My gpd is roughly 98gpd (7 concentrate shots -roughly 14g per shot). Concentrates have been hell.  Waking up every single day sweating like crazy, feeling  depressed until the first dose. Everyday for weeks on end I’d drive up to the smoke shop and say ‘Just one more day, I’ll quit tommorow’ . Spends another 140$ (20$ per shot) 

Despite the many failed attempts to quit I’m still confident that I can reach sobriety from k. At least I’ve learned various things in each quit and relapse.  Different triggers, the fact there’s no occasional use for me, acceptance of having some shitty days and not needing to get high to avoid them.. and more things..

Previous CT I’ve always leaned on marijuana hard and it has helped. (Daily smoker).. the one different thing with this quit has been the addition of clonodine. This shit has taken away 90% of my physical wd. I’m not sweating much, until 5 hours or so then pop another .1mg and I’m better. Just started seeing a new doctor and I was in their office for a different issue, second time ever seeing this doc, and I randomly mentioned ‘what do you know about kratom?’ He immediately got some scripts written out and said ‘hey, you don’t have to quit now but here’s some helper meds when time comes.’

I am sooo happy to have discovered clonodine. After quitting so many times I really notice a massive difference with eliminating the majority of wd. Taking .1mg as needed (4 pills on day 1, 3 on day 2, and took 1 so far this morning starting day 3. I plan on using this for 7 days and dropping.



If anyone out there has failed to quit (like me) please ask your primary care physician. About clonodine, it’s a blood pressure med but for some reason works WONDERS.  Taking the physical aspect away still means we have to deal with mental (cravings).  But hasn’t been too hard as I’m motivated to kick this shit to the curb

Had great sleep again (4 nights in a row, no more reliance on thc for that! Yeah! )

Woke up this morning not really aware of any significant withdrawal. Had some yard work tasks, felt good after sweating,  and I kinda forgot my maintenance doses. 

Around 1pm started to feel a little uneasy,  so took a 2g dose and felt fine rest of the afternoon. 

Around 530pm I realized it was an hour after I usually toss and wash my 4g banger. Felt fairly well and wondered if I should wait. Ultimately decided to take it. Felt a little guilty,  but decided it was important to prep for sleep tonight. 

What's interesting is that usually by this time im feeling withdrawal and when I take the 4g often I can feel the little high... but I really didn't.

So it was a day where withdrawals were slim and the dose didn't feel like much either lol.

I noticed a moment of sadness as I started to ponder a life without my powder high,  and then temptation,  but it was fleeting. 

The sadness and temptation was realizing I don't need this plant that gave me such pleasure,  all the while knowing the bag is in my hand with my little scooper. That's a disconcerting feeling,  but it was fleeting. 

Wouldn't be surprised at all if tomorrow is a little more normal with withdrawal etc. But I'm ready.

Heading to the Peak District (England) on Monday, just me and my dog for 4 nights and I’m excited. I feel free and peaceful. There is light at the end of of this dark scary tunnel and it’s worth getting your head down and powering through it. Peace to all 🦋",10,0

I found myself thinking more about others, more about my wife, more about my unborn baby girl on the way. 

Things get better, way better. The pain we experience after stopping the kratom is the same pain that makes us who we are as individuals. I realized quickly that I haven't really ""evolved"" in the last 4yrs. I became one of those furry green puddles that tadpoles get trapped in, stagnate.

I was watching an old episode of dragon ball z today, the one where vegeta comes and makes minced meat of android 19. 

Android 19 is our dependence, sucking the power out of us all. Vegeta found the will and the strength to make something so powerful and dangerous look SO weak and fragile.

Looking forward to not having to explain myself.,"As someone who is single and has been dating for a while now, I've always found it somewhat embarrasing or at least a source of worry when I eventually need to find a way to explain why I'm taking scoops of this powder every day. When do I tell them? How long can I hide it from them? Will they judge me? They seem okay with it for now.. but are they just saying that? I've considered hiding bags in the bathroom so I can take it in the morning after waking up without them knowing. Not a good sign, guys.


Being able to drop all these questions is something I'm most looking forward to. Being compatible with people who won't tolerate you being an addict (however functional you may be) is exciting. I'm certainly not normal, but will definitely be far more appealing to people without a tolerance for chronic drug use.


On a different note- living in a state where kratom is not legal meant always being extra cautious about and prepared for any interactions with the police. Naturally I was unable to go anywhere without a trusty bag of car kratom, so this was a source of concern every time I got behind the wheel. It's freeing knowing that I can say ""Yes officer, waste your time searching my car if you must,"" although I'm not one to allow police to overstep if I can help it.

Anyway, I just wanted to share some things I'm looking forward to while waves of anxiety course through me. Have a good weekend everyone!",6,0

One night I was cooking dinner, a pan started slipping from my hand and I instinctively reached to catch it. The dinner recovery mission was successful as I lifted the pan to the counter. It was only as I was pulling my hand away that I noticed the burns. I had so much kratom in my system that the pain had barely registered. 

Turns out the burns were second and third degree. That's when it really hit home just home much kratom is altering my body and my mind. Years of use had normalized this altered state but that needed to change.

It quit CT and it sucked. The first few days my willpower powered me through the withdrawl and sleepless nights just as it had in my past attempts to quit. By week two, as usual, my mental reisilance was beginning to fail. I needed to find my reason to keep fighting. Soon I did.

My hand was still badly burned and required daily care, but every day it improved. Every. day. it. improved. My body had not given up on me. Years of abuse and it was not giving up, not taking a day off. And neither could I. As long as my body would not give up on me, I could not give up on it. 

Together we healed. Some day were good, some were bad. But I could always look to my left hand. It became a physical representation of my mental healing. Even days I felt my mind slip backwards, I still knew I was healing. We would recover together.

It has been 161 days. The burn has long since turned to scars. Much like my addition. I do not think of it often, it is just a part of my past that's healed but will always be a part of me.That scar is the sign of resilience. It reminds me that everyday I feel weak, my body will never give up on me, and I can never give up on it.


For those of you out there struggling. Never give up. Your body hasn't given up trying to heal, don't give up trying to help it do so.",82,0

Got tired of the weird skin effects and just having my schedule revolve around dosing plus waking up in withdrawals every morning and starving myself for better effects.

Tried to ct at the end of May and relapsed after 2-3 days. I could deal with all the other symptoms ie; lethargy, runny nose, chills, sweating but the insomnia was just too much. Seemed to compound everything and I had an outing with my gf and her kids so I didn’t want to look like death and dosed to get some relief. 

Well I was back up to 20 gpd before deciding to taper maybe 2 weeks ago. Originally planned to drop .5 grams a day but got impatient and did a rapid taper and went from 16gpd last week to my last dose on Wednesday at 6 am after only maybe 4 hours sleep. Felt like crap all day Wednesday.

Had diarrhea Thursday but I equate that to some Indian food I ate Wednesday. Have been dosing 500 mg vit c 2x per day, jogging every other day for 30 minutes, eating normally, lifting maybe 2x per week, and using 1:1 5mg edible at night for sleep plus a sleep med with l-theanine and melatonin. I’ve actually been getting more sleep than I was before. No chills, no runny nose, no insomnia, no fatigue. I don’t get it? I think getting a solid 6-7 hrs of sleep has made all the difference.

I’m using the same vendor that I was when I got withdraw symptoms after ct.

Anyways, I hope this might help some shorter term users who are thinking of quitting but psyching themselves out over w/d’s like I was. I consider myself very lucky and don’t ever plan on taking this stuff again. I’ve been a poly drug abuser since my teens and am now 32. Opiates are the only thing I still seem to have no control over. Thankfully I never had the social skills to gain connections for the harder stuff, I think that’s why Kratom grew on me so much. I didn’t need to find a dealer, just load the online shopping cart and wait for it to show up.

 I know I need to put all this behind me for good. I’ll find other ways to deal with my chronic pain. Good luck to all those trying to get off. I know this plant has helped a great number but with my addictive personality the rewards just don’t outweigh the risks.",10,0

In my first post here I said I didn’t think I could quit. I was so discouraged by the early withdrawals and the fact that a dose didn’t seem to do much. The next day I made the best decision (for me) and dumped my remaining stash into the trash. I even poured water on it so I couldn’t use it. I went CT from a 30-50 gpd habit. 

The first week or so was really hard. It sucked. I look back on it now and it feels kind of like a bad dream. I didn’t sleep much at all and my body ached. I remember events we went to and things we did but it feels like another me did them. 

I’m not on the cusp of three weeks. My mood is still all over the place, but I know returning to K would only set me back. I’m sleeping so much better and today I feel optimistic for the first time in a long time.

First 4-5 days was the worst for me. Sleep is coming back slowly, a tiny bit better each day, but getting maybe 3-5 hours a night at best. But I want to write about some of the unexpected improvements that are a surprising me. Kratom took things away from me slowly, over time, like a frog in the proverbial hot water that I didn't notice as I used for 2.5 years.

1. My almost 25 year marriage to my awesome wife felt stale, and I even went to therapy to help myself understand. Well, part of it was my libido and sexual drive had been dulled by Kratom. We have always had a healthy romantic and sexual life, so this was dismaying. Well, after about 8-9 days I suddenly started to feel like I used to 5 years ago, appreciating her again, and being super attracted to her, which she liked. I had no idea K was dulling my emotional and physical relationship with my wife! It broke my heart, but I'm so glad I'm having this realization. Talk about motivation to stay clean! This is motivating for me.
2. Agree that exercise helps. I'm a life long weekend warrior and sort of amateur athlete and stay fit, so this has been key to getting through the last 10 days. I skipped some days last week because I was feeling so lethargic, but when I forced myself to move and exercise it helped me tremendously.
3. Days are almost back to normal, but about twice a day I just get tired and put my head down on my desk for 5-10 minutes. Then I bounce back and I'm ok.
4. I'm getting more appetite back. Now, when I get hungry it feels urgent and my stomach growls loudly. I've been craving whole foods and not much junk. It's like my body knows what it needs to heal. I like to cook, so I've been cooking a lot of the family meals because I need to eat well. It's like waking up to my appetite again. I thought I was fine on K, but now I realize it changed my appetite too. Had no idea.
5. I do like to drink casually, though not in large amounts these days. But, I've only had 2-3 drinks in 10 days. It just doesn't sound good. I could barely finish the ones I started, and I only tried a drink bc I was looking for some relaxation so I could sleep better! Not a good idea, but hey, when you're restless you try things.
6. There's surely more to share, but in short I feel like I'm waking up to myself again, a self I'd forgotten was there, dulled by kratom and lost. The best 20+ years of my life I was sober from everything, and remembering those great years are what's driving me right now, back when I needed nothing but life to feel great and fulfilled. I don't need substances and they seem to take a lot more from me than they give.

K,"Hi everyone, today is day 16 of CT after about 4.5 years around 15gpd. I had been having shortness of breath the first week of CT and was pretty anxious about that, but it has cleared up. 

Another thing that wasn't related to quitting but apparently was related to K use was trouble swallowing. Only in the past year or so did this start showing up, so I didn't think it was related to K. I would have trouble swallowing pills or even eating meals, especially something like a steak. It was kinda like I couldn't find the right muscles to swallow with. Really strange.  It must have been a side effect of K, because after about a week CT, it's not an issue anymore. I had a great steak dinner a couple nights ago and it was a great feeling.

Some things that helped me get this far:


-Immodium (following the dosage guidelines on the box) for the first few days seemed to keep a lot of the WD at bay. When I stopped taking it, I didn't notice any delayed WD symptoms.

-Bronkaid helped with the shortness of breath (but this was probably a mental thing. I don't think I was having a physical inability to breathe). It's OTC ephedrine, sold for asthma treatment in the US. It also helped with lethargy as a side benefit.

-I stumbled into a rather intense home construction project unintentionally. It was hard to find the energy, but I didn't have any choice. It kept me busy and extremely active and that really really helped. I didn't have any time to think about how miserable I felt.",6,0

Wow......feels like forever since I posted that last post about 38 hours in!  So here’s my update.  I’m on Day 16.  First two days I didn’t have much going on because I stayed very busy and took a lot of vitamin C and recommended supplements.  By day 3 withdrawals kicked in until about day 6....anxiety which I treated with gabapentin and supplements.  By day 7 I felt a little less anxious and took the gabapentin down in dose.  By day 11 I was rocking out to music.  Feeling amazing except for tiredness in my body.  But after day 9 slept almost 7 plus hours a night.  Day 3-7 didn’t sleep well cause of RLS but it has gone away.  Thought my sex drive would blow through the roof but it hasn’t this CT time.  Think it’s because of gabapentin.  Only took gabapentin first 15 days and got down to only taking 300mg a day.  Peak days took up to 1500mg to 1800mg.  I’m ready to drop off the gabapentin completely.  However I found this to be a gift in low dosages and have an appointment with my psychiatrist Wednesday to see if I should get a regular low dose script just to help with anxiety the next few months as I know it works.  So.....with quitting Kratom I quit alcohol too (which is a problem for me).  I’m 16 days sober from alcohol too.  God is good.  Motivation is good.  Wanting my brain to function without Kratom and alcohol is amazing.  I’ve hear many times in my journey to recovery that you can make all the excuses you want......but you won’t really give it your all in quitting if you don’t really want sobriety.  🙏🏼 for everyone who want to gain that motivation.

CBD takes the edge off but isn’t a cure all. Anyone have any insight on when this starts to get better? Cravings aren’t my problem, after the way kratom has made me feel I’ll never touch it again. Just hoping that my mental stuff starts improving soon. I hope everyone is doing well and if you’re in the Pacific Northwest like me stay cool and stay hydrated.",9,0

I finally have the mental strength to get this post made. I was a 4 year user of high doses 4 to 6 times a day. This has been the hardest thing mentally and physically I've ever been through.

Nobody in my life knows that I use this stuff. I've ruined relationships, friendships and more but stuck so loyally to the one thing that was doing it all for four years. I have a trip planned with family coming up and I'm so sick of the only thing being on my mind when I'm with friends and family being when my next dose is and if I have enough and how long what we are doing is going to take so I can go sneak in another dose.. It's exhausting and I'm never really present. 

Anyway, I'm done with it. my quitting experience has been hard. Day one through three were the toughest physically. Everything hurts, all the symptoms everyone says on here hit with in 12 hours, It really does suck but its manageable. Take it one day at a time. Showers really helped during that time and still do. By day four almost all the bad physical stuff was gone, except for the damn RLS and inability to sleep. I didn't sleep for probably 5 days straight even now I maybe get 2 or 3 hours. honestly for me right now not being able to sleep when everything to your core is so exhausted is the worst part for me. I could go on about the details but they are all said on here a lot. anyways.

After day 6 it's gotten better, I can finally eat again, things don't seem as bad and I finally got some sleep. I'm so glad I took the jump and I cant wait to hopefully be able to be present and enjoy the time I have coming up with my family for the first time in a long time.

Tips that I can give, ( I know I'm nowhere near through this and no expert on any of this but just trying to help anyone whos starting their own journey) 

\- Drink water, get some icy hot or Biofreeze for your legs and joints that will help keep your legs calm, take showers when you need a boost or are feeling really bad, Take walks and exercise (helped me so much) , don't forget to eat small healthy things the first couple days its makes your stomach feel better, there's a thing called Hylands restful legs that helped as well. Also CALM anti-stress drink mix helps. Having a goal and a reason that your quitting is a must for me at least, having that thing in your mind that is pushing you to go through this hell is the only way I have kept going. get through the first week and you'll be ok. take it day by day. Also drowning that little green devil down the toilet or sink the day you quit is scary but feels so freeing! Good luck and thanks for anyone who took the time to read.",9,0

117,2021-06-25 18:58:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/o7ynp2/living_again/,Living Again,"I’ve been a kratom user for about 4.5 years and have tried to quit so many times. My usage wasn’t crazy-maybe 15-20 GPD- but it was enough to make me feel like an empty version of who I used to be. I couldn’t do anything without taking kratom first. Waking up, working, socializing, exercising, all required a dose of kratom to “get me through.” That mindset has been the hardest part about quitting, even more than the absence of the substance itself.

I always thought I was one of those people who couldn’t taper, so I never tried. But this spring, after a number of failed CT attempts that lasted a few days each, I was desperate enough to try a different approach. I’m so glad I did. It wasn’t perfect or exact, but I went from dosing 5 grams 3-4 times a day to twice a day to once a day over a two month period. I never thought I’d be able to function on one dose a day, but I did it for about a week, and it was easier than you would think. Jumping off was a relief. I had some night sweats and a few days of brain fog, and that was it. 

The mental part has been tough. Week 3 was probably the worst because I felt fine physically, but nothing brought me any joy and life felt so grey and empty. I had a few dark days in my taper, but this depression was real. I am not prone to depression so I am not familiar with this feeling of hopelessness, but it has definitely given me some perspective on a darker side of life that I’ve never experienced and never want to experience again. I will forever be grateful for a chemically balanced mind now that kratom is out of my system. 

It’s been 25 days since I last took kratom, and that hopeless feeling is finally starting to lift. I still have healing to do, but  I have energy again and am living my life at ten times the capacity that kratom would ever allow. Everyone is different, but I know tapering is what is making the difference for me this time around. I haven’t had a single craving since I quit because my brain had time to adjust to not depending on that dose that’s right around the corner. I had to get used to doing things without kratom before I quit for good. I also think that I didn’t want to try tapering before because I didn’t actually want to quit. I wanted to keep taking it as much as I wanted until that magic quit date where everything was going to somehow change and I would just stop. For me, I had to start letting go before I actually let go. 

I am so happy to be done and wanted to post some encouragement to anyone who keeps trying and failing. Once you decide you really want to quit, you’ll get there in some way, shape or form. Your journey is your journey and there are many ways to get there. No matter how long or how many times it takes, we all have the capacity to come back to life.",19,0

Realize that it's because I've used kratom that quitting other substances has been relatively easy (er) lol (it wasn't)..

I tried going CT a couple weeks ago but didn't really feel that much of a difference until day 3, then I bounced back on kratom. 

Think tapering might be the best route for me.

The ""afterglow"" of kratom is so strong when I wake up.. Having really bad neck aches/headaches that will only go away with use.. 

Hopefully by cutting down slowly I can beat this thing.

Any helpful tips are very much welcome.

I've used kratom for about 8 years, ended up using 30gram (red borneo mostly) a day on top of a heap of other substances. I tried quitting kratom a lot of times over the years, always ended up relapsing with the thought ""just once more"" every ""once more"" resulted in continuing right where I left off. I became a hostage as I could not function without, or really just travel, I had to always carry a pot of green powder on me and have a private place to wash it down. When I was under the influence I was not high, I was devoid of any emotions, I felt less and less human.

I've dealt with withdrawal both cold turkey and from tapering.

I'm hoping that I can help someone here who is still struggling to get off, I know your pain, physically and mentally. It is possible to be able to enjoy life again, the world's not a grey mist (that's how my world view was at least).

My mom brought me some Gatorade and I drank it all within 24 hours. I literally just ate for the first time- husband brought me an orange, and it felt like eating an enormous feast.

I know I'm one of those people who's especially at risk from kratom because the reason my doc told me to quit is because my liver enzymes were elevated, and since I don't drink ever or take NSAIDs very often, she attributed it to the kratom.

- Plan it out, take 3-5 days off work if possible
- surround yourself with things that make you happy or made you happy before kratom (this helped with the depression a lot) my big thing was music 
- Make sure you have plenty of water and it doesn't hurt to get some electrolyte replacement drinks like pedialyte or Gatorade
- eat on a consistent schedule and stick with bland easy to digest foods
- You will most likely have some body aches but be careful with the pain relievers taking to much Tylenol is dangerous and taking to much ibuprofen is also dangerous and will be rough on your stomach go as long as you can take follow the directions on the labels
- Anxiety was my worst symptom I found comfort in staying as active as I could and went on frequent walks around my neighborhood it really helped a lot I also found relief from yoga 
- Insomnia is also likely most people will do sleep aids but again be careful of sleep aids that contain acetaminophen and ibuprofen if you are taking it all day for the aches 
- Its ok to be mad at kratom but don't get mad at yourself just move forward you will only make the symptoms worse by blaming yourself or obsessing over what you could have done differently just learn and don't repeat the mistake 
- PLEASE if at all possible tell someone you trust what you are doing so you have a person to talk to through the process 
- consult with a doctor if you feel you can't handle the symptoms everyone is different and although you may feel ashamed to try and explain this to your doctor you need to stay focused on yourself asking for help is perfectly fine
- Massage greatly helped with the aches I know that is not available for everyone but if you are throwing all your money at kratom diverting those funds to massage therapy during the process should be doable 

All that being said here is some of my first hand experience after the withdrawls:
- I experienced a noticeable surge of mental clarity its almost like you snapped out of a haze this was a very reassuring part of the process
- I realized that even though kratom enhanced your mood it also enhanced your anxiety I know this sounds strange but as someone with diagnosed anxiety I can tell you I feel much less anxious off kratom...
- I have become much more social and talkative 
- Anything that I do that naturally releases endorphins feels better than it did when I was drinking kratom 
- My natural motivation has returned and I get excited to do the things I enjoy
- Sleep has taken the longest to get back to normal but it has improved with each day
- After going through those withdrawls the absolute LAST thing on my mind is ever drinking that stuff again

My Kratom consumption was anywhere from 40 to 70gpd and I drank it for around 5 years 

This reddit was the reason I was able to get to the place I needed to be to quit.. I kept telling myself I won't drink it forever ill just wait for a convenient time to stop but reading this reddit made me realize I need to make a move now and improve my quality of life and it worked

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I'm a little worried something else is wrong with me. kratom sucks.

Age 22-24 I’m taking 10 oxy 30s a day, I successfully beat those withdrawls CT, and was good for a couple months completely sober... until my addict mind came across the “magical” plant kratom. I soon spiraled out of control in a full blown addiction to that green sludge. I was taking 75/80GPD for a solid year, this cycle began to feel way to similar to the addiction I thought I had coercome with opiates. Anyways, the day came where I ran out and completely put my mind to quitting. Here’s how it went for anyone looking to quit.. or in the process of quitting. 

Day 1: day one always gives you false hope I would say.... I felt great the first day off kratom, I thought it was going to be sutch a breeze, I had confidence thinking I was going to do this so so easily... I was wrong. 

Day 2-4: probably the peak of the roller coaster ride of withdrawls for me- cold sweats, heart pounding anxiety, paranoia (in a sense) couldn’t be around people, fatigue, vomit, diarrhea, NO SLEEP , RLS UNBEARABLE (not meaning to scare anyone but brutal honesty of what happens) 

Day 5-7- I would describe these days as the comedown of withdrawls ( even though they aren’t gone, symptoms start to ease up, my worst and hardest symptoms here was the crippling depression

I have a comorbid mental health condition with substance addiction. Currently, Kratom is the only thing that I am using. So I tried to detox on my own... and it wasn't really the physical side effects that made me stop. It was the mental side effects... I started having really bad suicidal thoughts and feelings that I was completely alone in the world. When I first started using Kratom it was to help with some really bad PTSD anxiety that I was experiencing. It helps for a little bit but eventually there were too many negative side effects as well. Has anybody else tried to detox off of this and experience negative mental health effects? I'm wondering if I should go into a detox and get medical assistant detox?",3,0

Ive quit several times and kicked it for no longer than 5 days before I feel like my depression and phsyical pain just isnt worth working on without it.

&#x200B;

But im so determined. Life is hell on this stuff. I wake up in a cold sweat and I lay in bed waiting for the first dose to kick in. then once im normal I take my second dose. and I feel perfect for the next few hours. It feels like its working exactly how it should. No pain, no anxiety, happy, productive, doing well at work. After that its just downhill. the amount that I need to maintain that feeling is so high that the side effects overwhelm any euphoria. fighting irratibility and nasuea until its time for me to go to sleep and i do 2 shots of zzzquil so i can pass out as soon as possible. I feel like I need this just maintain my life. And quitting is daunting because after the first 2 or 3 days of feeling like absolute anxiety ridden hell, the next 3 or 4 days is when the depression is deep, and my mind tells me that even though its hell, its better than this feeling of emptiness and boredom, and i relapse again with in a week.. But i dont want to do that again. 

&#x200B;

Im reading all your stories, about you toughing it out and then coming out happy on the other side. feeling like it was so worth it. feeling like youre a normal person again. I need to fight through this until the craving goes away. I tried the taper but i dont have the ability. over the past few months i finally tapered all the way down to 10gpd, everything felt managable, but within days i shot back up to massive doses just because of stress in every day life. I need to remove kratom from the equation. It cant be an option for me to manage my day with it. I need to go cold turkey.

&#x200B;

I took time off work. Saturday evening will be my last dose. I dont have to work again until thursday. Im hoping thats enough time to at least get functional again. I miss my life. I dont want to be addicted any more. I just feel like im not strong enough to not pick up again, but im going to try.

Thanks for all the positivity here. I read the success stories every day and its the only thing that gives me hope. Its such a dumb, shitty drug. I've quit alcohol, i've quit cigarettes, I've quit heroin, and suboxone, and a xanax and a shit load of other terrible drugs, but this one really has its hold on me.

&#x200B;

I got some 5htp, and magnesium, and some b vitamin. I have till sunday to prepare, so if anyone else has any advice as far as vitamins or ways to prepare for the withdrawal, shout it out.

Im going to try to stay on this group for the days im going through it just to keep reading about other peoples success, and to post updates on condition (if i feel like I can).

Thanks again everyone",4,0

I tried to quit 2 times and the WD symptoms were incredibly painful and the hopelessness was unbearable. I relapsed within a week each time. The last attempt was over 4 years ago.

Just a little observation that I have noticed. It seems like a good bit of people buy from stores in person, always found the quality subpar and really keyed up.
I only used pure leaf, purchased either from vendor or, in the very early days, the farm directly. I always thought the extracts were bad news and never really did too many.
I tried maybe 20 or so vendors online and the last one I used was very specific with testing their products to make sure no additives or extracts were added to their leaf. At least that's what the claimed, they do have lab results but photoshop is easy am I right??
I could actually tell the difference when I used them. A lot less effective and jittery. Not as much of a body load or euphoria either.
I've used this vendor exclusively for the past 3+ years.

So the point I'm getting at...
This WD has been soooooooo much easier than the first two attempts. 
*the first two attempts to quit were cold turkey with zero taper. They sucked big time. 

For one, I have been taking a good bit of supplements and trying to give myself tasks to accomplish each day (very easy ones, like put the dishes in the dishwasher and turn it on). Supplements I am taking are:
Black seed oil 3x daily
Tryptophan 3x daily
Ashwaganda 3x daily
L-Tyrosine 3x daily
Vitamin C 3-5x daily
Zinc
Magnesium 2-3x daily
Valerian Root at bedtime *started on day 2 and it helps soooo much 
Ibuprofen 
Cbd/thc Gummies occasionally 
Heavy indica hash pen (best thing for sleep and rls) *side note, I hate the effects of cannabis, but it's been a godsend for this period of time


Second, I have been wanting to quit for 2 years, mentally I just couldn't do it. Finally I just had enough with the amount of money I spent and all the bs that comes with extended kratom use. 
This time I did a 3 month taper and then a 1 month switch to Stem&Vein. The stem&vein felt like I was in a WD most of the time. Very poor quality product and only exasperated my urge to quit. It holds 3.5x less the mitragynine content as the pure leaf that I was taking.
Taper was from 50gpd to 20gpd over 3 months then the kilo of stem&vein over a month until my CT day (6/21). 
Just for your knowledge, the kilo of S&V is equivalent to 285g of pure leaf (from the vendor I used), so over a month is about 9-10gpd of pure leaf.
So technically, I jumped from about 10gpd of pure leaf (actually about 30gpd of S&V) for my CT day.
I also think the S&V for a month was a mild WD the entire time. I never felt awake, constantly exhausted, and mild rls/nerve pain constantly when dose was missed. So that might be an additional reason for the relatively ""easier"" WD.

Finally, I honestly believe the switch to this particular vendor really helped with the overall detox and lessened the WD symptoms. Pure speculation, but compared to the other times, I think it helped.

***Mistake made this week***
- DXM on 1st night to combat RLS and to sleep. DID NOT WORK FOR ME. I didn't sleep the first night. It just made my RLS 10x worse. Fire crawling through my skin.

***Positive Notes***
- I decided to not pity myself like the previous times. This helped me a lot. Whenever I was feeling too sad or too tired, I told myself it was temporary and let myself be in the moment before saying F#@K YOU, it's just the kratom trying to sink you back into it's teeth.
- Go on walks. It hurts like hell but it might help with rls and might get you to sleep a bit.
- Take Epsom salt baths. Helped with my rls in such a large way. I took valerian root extract, melatonin, and indica before bed. I still felt the rls but I was able to get enough sleep (6+hrs) from day 2 to now.

In conclusion, I think the worst of my withdrawal symptoms are over. I actually can feel emotions again and look forward to the next few weeks. I will say the lack of motivation and lead weight legs are extremely annoying.

I hope this is a helpful and hopeful story to those of you wanting to quit. Not all of you are going to have a WD horror story. Look at me, 10+ year user and I'm feeling way better at the end of Day 4! I honestly hope this post doesn't jinx it!
When you decide to quit, be smart about how you prepare for your CT date, know what you're taking and try to taper, prepare your supplements, take time off, and always remember you are going to pay the piper. Accept it and embrace the roller-coaster ride.

It is worth it!!",26,0

I use this sub for group support but i think i need to seek help from a professional. Has anyone tried to get professional help and if so, did it make a difference?

1 year ago I traded pain pills for 1 extract shot per day probably 3-4 times a week. Recently it’s been 1 shot per day and i am starting to notice Kratom is turning on me. I get brain fog and i am not sharp, constantly making mistakes at work. These past three months I’ve tried to quit countless times. Longest I’ve made it was 7 days and that’s because I was on vacation where they didn’t sell it. I tried to taper recently with powder - didn’t work. 

Im starting to see my hair falling out and know that Kratom is turning on me. I get paranoid about all the negative effects it’s having on my brain and body - many of which i am unaware of probably. I am so frustrated that my addict brain ALWAYS finds a reason to drive itself to the smoke shop and buy another extract shot. 

I don’t have anyone close to me who I can vent to about this. My boyfriend is also a user but he seems to think he has full control over it and it’s not a problem. Whenever I talk to him about it he thinks I’m over thinking it and says he can just stop using it he wanted to. This disconnect forces me to suffer silently and use this sub as my support group, which has been a lifesaver.

Hi all. Day 33 of my taper. I am/was down to 9gpd down from 30ish.

Yesterday I got pissed about something so small and my toddler lizard brain threw a huge tantrum and said who gives an all-caps fuck, called the day a wash, and took two big ol' doses that probably almost doubled my allotted gpd.

My reward for cheating was a weird feeling that taking a deep breath was going to make me barf. But I wasn't nauseous in the classic sense. This morning I have a bad headache and the full body heebie-jeebies.

I think I've been seeing my anger in a really disassociated way, not realizing the part it plays in me keeping myself down. I exalt it in one context because it has fueled some truly kickass battles over the years, and I can view it with a benign calmness in other contexts. But there are lots of other times that I downplay when it just drives me to snap and behave in regrettable ways. I always just say, oh god that was awful, I am so ashamed and embarrassed, I will never do that again. Then I do it again. Oh. Like kratom!!

I don't foresee any long-term quitting success for myself without making a sincere effort to address this as part of the process. Wondering if anybody can recommend any books, videos, methods to get started? Therapy isn't in my budget at the moment. I looked up books last night but the vast selection was a little overwhelming. I went ahead and picked one cuz something is hopefully better than nothing.

I've been using for over 10 years and just made it to day 22 with no kratom for the first time since I started taking K regularly. 

I was a 50gpd user. I literally have no idea how many times I've tried to quit. Slow tapers would drag symptoms out too long and wear me down. CT would completely wreck me. I have kids and a full time manual labor intensive job. I could put some of these responsibilities off for a few days but never long enough. I would always break and buy more before getting out of the acutes. 

What finally stuck with me was a rapid taper method that I just kind of came up with by accident. I don't want to get into specifics but my urologist had some concerns about my health without much of an idea what is causing it. My wife suspected the kratom and brought it up to him. He said there isn't much known about kratom but could be involved. That was enough to convince my wife I needed to get off and fast. We decided on dropping immediately to 10gpd with a morning and night dose for 1 week. Then, 5gpd with a morning and night dose for 1 week. Then quit completely. I was really surprised how much easier this quit was compared to the many others. (I admit my health concerns could have something to do with that as well). It seemed to provide the benefits of both methods. I could still function (although completely miserable) and didn't have to drag on the withdrawals for weeks or months or have self control for an extended period of time.

just wanted to share my current WD experience with you. I have been taking pretty high doses of Kratom (about 30gdp) for many years now in order to battle my depressions. Until a certain point that worked out pretty well but especially during the last few month I increasingly began noticing the side effects like losing weight, lack of appetite and sexual desire.

I want to get off this f*cking tree once and for all. So this time I decided to keep going no matter what. And I am really confident that I'll get through the WD this time as I got a whole stack of medicine and supplements here to help:

-Pregabaline
-Black Seed Oil
-Alprazolam (Xanax)
-Doxepine (expired 2018, not sure if still safe?)
-Loperamide
-Ibuprofine
-Ashwaghanda

Notice that I am prescribed 300mg Pregabaline & 150mg Bupropion daily - which is why I have to take way higher doses of pregabaline to weaken the WD Symptoms.

Yesterday (First day of WD)  I took about 1000mg of Pregabaline, 0,375mg alprazolame, 300mg Ibuprofen, 3 Table Spoons black Seed oil. The night was pretty rough but somehow I still managed to sleep around 4am. Woke up a few times and RLS kinda sucked (Always the worst) but all in all the night was okay.

Today I woke up and felt pretty good. I had a bit of a hangover because of the high Pregabaline dose and the xanax but I didnt feel any WD Symptoms which made me really happy. Its 4pm how and so far I have only taken my regular Pregabaline dose (300mg) and 0,125mg alprazolam. I can feel the WD symptoms rushing back and I am not really sure on how to continue. On the one hand I want to prevent taking such high doses of pregabaline on the other hand it really helps and I keep telling myself its just for a few days. I have never increased my pregabaline dose on my own before without talking to my doc first so I dont think there is a risk for another addiction (haha, of course I AM addicted to Pregabaline already but I alway stick to my prescribed dose under normal circumstances)

Maybe you guys have a good recommendation on how to keep going. I really want to get off Kratom for good but I am a huge pussy when it comes to withdrawal symptoms, especially RLS. Do you guys think I should just go with higher pregabaline doses for the next few days or is there a better way? 

Thank you!",2,0

I've lost 20-30% of my strength and lots of muscle the past couple months. Blood was drawn in the midst of kratom usage, about 6 hours after waking up.

15-20 GPD for one year followed by 8-10 GPD for 6 months.

My question is, if I'm going that long with such a small dose, is it time to jump? Like I said, at that low dose it actually does help and I feel great(have for a week now) but I just don't know the health risks along with taking 4g of kratom everyday.

Has anybody had a similar hair loss history and it stopped or grew back when you stopped taking Kratom? I'm thinking about going to rehab but I'm not sure if my hair loss could be caused by the K even if it started years after I started taking it regularly. Any ideas about that?

I'll get right to the point. I have been fighting a prodigious opioid addiction for years now. I am having great success (broadly) thanks to my support network and the recovery skills I have learned, but I'm in trouble, and I think, I hope, that someone can help guide me here.

About 16 months ago, I decided to go to a buprenorphine maintenance clinic. I had exhausted all my other attempts at getting clean. So for about a year, I stabilized on a maintenance dose of 16mg of bupe per day. I stayed in a halfway house during this time. The halfway house closed unexpectedly. So I decided that I would go ahead and taper of the bupe and return to normal life. I got a little too ambitious. So I tapered from 16 to 0 in about 10 days. 🤣 Needless to say, I got very uncomfortable starting about 5 days after my last bupe dose. I white-knuckled it for four more days, and then I was in agony. I had some experience with Kratom, so I thought it would help to use some Kratom to do ease the symptoms, which I certainly did.

Fast forward two months later to today. I now have a 20-25g/day Kratom habit. When I try to quit, even taper, I get heroin-level withdrawals beginning about 4-5 hours after my last dose of Kratom. So now I'm in an even weirder boat. I am shocked at the level of nausea and RLS; it's nearly the same as when I would get sick from IV heroin withdrawal. It's absolutely baffling. The nausea is profound. It nearly prevents me from functioning, and the RLS is torture. Even taking more Kratom is relatively ineffective at this point because I think my body has reached the point where it will not tolerate a higher dose.

Otherwise, in my life, I am doing okay. I have not regressed to a state of IV drug use which is paramount, but I am starting to doubt my ability to get through this. Had I fully understood that these withdrawals would be comparable to the classical opioids, I would have never begun taking it. I know this is a bit of a vent, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",11,0

I was able to use about 1/2 of my normal quantity and decrease number of doeses per day. 10 grams per does to 5 grams and 5 or 6 to 3 doeses. Slight body aches but my mind stayed clear and RLS did not hassle me. This isn't solid proof but somewhere between those two factors things changed. I will continue a taper and try lions mane again in a week or two and check back in. Probably add some running in to emulate the stress.

I did in fact taper down to about 18-20gpd and experienced moderate WDs, sleepless nights, restless legs, sweating, irritability, etc. But I also felt the positive benefits, like actually wanting to eat meals, more of a sex drive, and general clarity. Well after tapering down quite a bit I relapsed a bit and went on for the next year or so at a ~20gpd habit.


Even at what some may consider a 'moderate' per day habit, my life revolves around this green sludge. I don't make plans because I don't want to have to take my blender bottle and this damned powder with me. I'm missing out on friend and family times that I'll never get back, and to be honest, I'm super pissed at myself for not continuing my taper back then.

But today will be the first day that I actually track my Kratom use. I developed a Google Doc Spreadsheet and I will time my doses out. I'm not going to officially start the taper until I get a handle on how much I'm actually using, but here goes nothing. One step at a time.

I am also going to order some running shoes and re-enroll at the gym close to my house. Kratom or not, I could use some exercise and activity. I've lurked this sub for the past couple of days and I keep seeing how much exercise can help, so I'm going to try it.


Sorry if this post is a little rambly.. My anxiety is all over the place when it comes to thinking about quitting, but I gotta do it. I know it's gonna suck, and I wish I could just CT, but I'm super afraid of going that route. I do not want to fail. The accountability factor of posting this, even anonymously, gives me a bit of solace. Thanks for reading this.",10,0

I’ve done a rapid taper the last week from 20ish GPD to 10 GPD. Dosing every 4 hours. Right now I’m at the point where I feel “Good” for 90 minutes following my dose and then waves of anxiety/depression for the next two hours.

Would like to be at 4 GPD this time next week and just going to say fuck it and deal with it. 

I’ve used everyday since April as a way to stop drinking and that’s worked. Drinking was going to end up ruining my life no question about it so I know Kratom has helped, I just foolishly used it everyday and it’s caught up to me already.

It’s funny I’ve actually worked out more and ate healthier on Kratom then any point in my life. The trade off is I’m addicted to this shit, wake up in withdrawal , no real appetite,no libido, feel like shit after my dose wears off.....

I have a family vacation with the wife and kids coming up after the 4th of July with other couples and really don’t want to have to be sneaking away every 3-4 hours just to feel good and sociable again. 

Like to thank everybody on this forum for their tips and encouragement. I’ve picked up a bunch of the suggested supplements. Very thankful I’ve found you guys before I was too deep into this shit. For all you struggling I’m sending my virtual support your way. Lets get over this together.",6,0

Have any of you ever experienced any of this?   What did you do to combat / get better?

I hope this is not TMI but -> on day 2-3 I had some takeout from one of those lower end Japanese spots..simple dish..but I smelled that dish when I ate it, when I was farting after, and now DAYS later in my farts AND poos..and my poops have not been solid at all

Wondering if it's from the 30-40+ GPD I was consuming, and not having all that fiber?

I consume live probiotics just about every day, eat a balance of veggies and quality meats, and maintain good health.  No problems before quitting kratom (and that Japanese takeout bullshit)",2,0

That's a brave step itself, and it's made this process so much easier. I apologize for the long post, I've been wanting to share for awhile but finally worked up the courage.

I was using Kratom daily for about 2 years, taking about 25-30gpd for the last year or so. I started taking Kratom because I enjoyed the pleasant side effects, and then started using it to help cope with anxiety. Overtime it went from occasional use, to daily use, to multiple doses daily. It ruined my libido, overall energy, desire to do anything, made it harder to focus at work, and eventually made my anxiety and depression worse. I really leaned into K once the pandemic hit...

I've been wanting to stop taking K for at least the last 6 months but could never get out of the cycle of dosing. Then 2 months ago i started experiencing this bizarre discomfort / pain in the pelvic area, and i freaked out. Went to a variety of urgent cares, got a new primary care physician, had imaging done and no one could tell what was wrong. I was too embarrassed to tell them i was taking Kratom all the time, so i started to freak out thinking it was somehow causing the pain. Through the process of seeing the various doctors, i was prescribed a variety of pain meds, antibiotics, and an antidepressant. I had a bad reaction to every pain med and the antidepressant which caused my mental health to rapidly decline. I had been too embarrassed to tell any of the doctors that i was using Kratom, so i was panicking thinking that maybe some of the pain or bad reactions to meds were caused by it, but again was too embarrassed to say something.

In all of that confusion, pain, and panic, I decided it was time to quit once and for all. I wanted to be in control of my health, and remove any variables from the equation.

I decided to do a CT quit, so i just stopped taking k. I threw out all of the capsules i had... That only lasted two days due to the extreme muscle aches. I picked up more and dosed again. But i was still determined! So instead of jumping back to 25-30gpd, i was resolved to only take 6gpd, 3 in the morning to help with aches and 3 at night to help me sleep. I did that for about a week, started to take vitamin c and drink lots of water. I then dropped to 3gpd, just one dose in the morning. I did that for a few days, then decided to try and drop to 2gpd. After two days on 2gpd i decided it was time. I just stopped taking anything. That was 11 days ago, and i have had hardly any cravings and most of the symptoms are very manageable (mainly sneezing, minor body aches, some mood swings). I'm even extra excited because I'm leaving for a trip today and had originally planned on bringing some Kratom to continue the taper, but for the first time in years i don't have to stress about having enough Kratom on hand to continue dosing away from home. I can just be present and enjoy my trip without craving for a dose.

In the spirit of taking back control of my life, i was resolved to start exercising again, eating healthy, getting outside more, and started to see a therapist to work on the anxiety i was taking Kratom for. I've found that yoga really helps with the muscle aches, and once i wasn't aching so much i was able to exercise and eat healthy which gave me more energy. There are days where i struggle to find the motivation or energy to do these things, but when I push through and force myself to workout and eat healthy, i feel so much better.

It feels REALLY good to be on this road to recovery, even if there are days that absolutely suck. I didn't think I'd ever be free of Kratom, but I'm on the right path now. A huge part of me sticking with this was reading everyone's stories here. They're so inspiring. Knowing people have gone through similar experiences and have come out the other side okay, is so relieving. I just thought I'd add my experience to help keep myself accountable and also maybe help someone who is struggling themselves. Thanks everyone!",15,1

I went to 40 days of treatment and got completely sober 9 months ago. No weed or anything. I am doing so much better than I have ever been in my life.

I have tried a multitude of ways of getting off kratom or replacing it with other substances, but I never addressed the root cause of why I was using drugs every day from age 15 to 25... so I was never successful, the main reason I was doing kratom was to replace more dangerous drugs i used to be physically addicted to. When it comes to any psychoactive drug I tend to be very psychologically and physically addicted to it.

I worked through a 12 step program with a sponsor to reorganize my life and I go to meetings regularly.

Many of you probably would not want to do this but I did and my life has never been this good. I could rarely go a week completely sober until i did this.",15,0

Was hesitant but gave it a try... and it works and is so much better. 

I discovered a dose of 1 gram actually provides tangible relief for a few hours. 

So I take 1 gram in the morning to get me started. Then tough it out for a 2g dose afternoon,  then a 4g around dinner time. That seems to get me through the night. I woke up once, took 1g around 130am, and I slept through the night.

So I stayed under 9g for the day with not nearly the same suffering. 

This is day 24 I think of tapering. The first few weeks of paying him with one payment created a lot of suffering,  but that wasn't wasted. I've learned that suffering is healing,  it's getting out of existential debt.. but the piper is not without compassion. He accepts customized payment plans.",5,0
204,2021-06-23 07:57:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/o6bavo/leaving_the_cage/,Leaving the cage 💗,"Today is 50 days CT! I used 25-30 gpd for 2.5 years. At the end, I was using closer to 40 gpd and I was sick all. the. time. My day would start with racing/dark thoughts and my goal for the morning was to make it until 10am without using. I was sweaty, skinny, nauseous, irritable, exhausted, losing hair, and extremely angsty. I felt so trapped. 

At the time, I couldn’t imagine my life without Kratom. I had built an invisible cage for myself and considered my addiction and symptoms of withdrawal the walls that kept me locked inside. I didn’t know I was in a cage until joining this group. Then, as I read through the posts, and learned the truth through the experience of others, I saw the walls around me. 🤯 Slowly the door came into focus, and I knew the only way out of the cage was to STOP. But stopping was really fucking scary. 

Something I’ve realized going through this journey is that in order to leave the cage, you have to be wicked brave. Braver than I originally realized, but the good news is, it’s inside of all of us, just waiting to be tapped into! I had to face whatever came up when I walked out of the cage and KNOW that I had everything inside of me to experience it and be OK. This is easier said than done, but it’s very simple: *stop putting Kratom into the body, then be brave and experience/be ok with whatever happens next.*

Through doing this, I have developed so much more awareness of my inner world. I can feel when things get tight and when I need to release and relax. At first I was just releasing and relaxing through withdrawal. I would notice what I was thinking/feeling, then notice that I was noticing, and relax around the thought/feeling. It worked! Then I started releasing and relaxing through everything! My kids being annoying, my work, jealousy, self-defeating thoughts, body shame, weeks upon weeks of PAWS, basically any fricken thing! And you know what it does? It starts to clear the shit that made me need drugs/alcohol in the first place. It quiets the voice in the head so you are free to be you, the one experiencing life. 

If I spend the rest of my life relaxing and releasing, I consider myself lucky! Life gives me annoying shit to practice with every day. 🤣 

The last 50 days of my life have largely been devoted to withdrawing and recovering from Kratom, and I’m so grateful for the good and bad days. 

Thank you to everyone here who showed me the way out of the cage, and reminds me to be grateful each and every day. I love checking in with you all, reading the experiences of others, and sharing what worked for me. There hasn’t been a day since I quit that I haven’t looked into this group. I’ve learned sooo much the past couple months. I now have a PhD in Kratom withdrawal, thanks to all my honeys! 🤣 Thank you for making this a place I could feel safe to do one of the hardest fucking things I’ve ever done! ❤️ Let’s keep going!

I've started drinking more water, and only distilled water, slept really well last night and my mind feels clear today.

I'm ready for some more bad days as I don't think this is over yet.

So glad I quit! 

Although I wouldn't go back and not take kratom because it helped me stop drinking and taking cocaine.

I’ve been apart of this group for quite some time now and just finally mustered up the courage to cold turkey it 3.5 days ago. Besides the lack of sleep, things are actually starting to feel a little bit better this morning(4:30am lol been up for almost an hour)
I overcame the grips of a terrible heroin addiction over 5 years ago, and picked the Kratom up, 2 years ago. I’ve experienced a lot more discomfort in the past, that’s what I keep telling myself to get through because your mind plays tricks on you. It’s almost like your mind tricks you into forgetting how crappy you used to feel, and while it’s not as bad as my last vices, it’s still very uncomfortable. 
Cannabis is helping tremendously as well as Advil. I just read that antihistamines make it worse for sleep, so I’m going to try sleeping without that tonight(my mistake). 
I know I’m just starting off, but if there’s anybody out there reading this, contemplating quitting, or struggling to quit, just know that whatever you put your mind to you can accomplish! A lot of this is your mind playing tricks on you, to make you believe you need one more dose, or even just a half of a dose to get you off of e. Nope! Don’t do it!
The cold turkey method is what I chose to do, not because I am strong, but because I know how I can get stuck tricking myself into believing I don’t have to stop. I didn’t even plan it, it just happened that’s why I say I’m 3.5 days abstinent. I took my last dose 3.5 days ago(god willing) and when it came time to take another dose I opted out. 
Good luck to all those going through this and fighting the good fight!

Absolutely no withdrawals.,"Just want to share what I'm doing differently. I've tried quitting several times. I was in agony, and relapsed. Over and over. I honestly thought I'd be addicted for life, that I'd be on my death bed asking for another dose, and would even rationalize being a life long opioid addict. Well something came over me 3 days ago while I was on a walk. Something in my soul came over me. I opened my backpack, took out the kratom bag, and dumped it all out. I couldn't believe what I did after.

It has now been 3 days. I have experienced no withdrawals. At all. I'll yawn more than usual, but that's it. Everyday, I exercise. Excessively. I will myself out of bed, get on my bike, and ride for hours. I stop at the fitness court and push myself 'til I can't feel my arms anymore, then get back on my fucking bike and keep going. I have discovered tons of new music and I feel it touch my soul now. I made love to my girlfriend and felt like I fell back in love with her all over again. I haven't felt that passion in so long. It feels like I've been asleep for 4 years, and I am now waking up and seeing how great life really is. I am not turning back. I'm telling you guys, the CT guide in the sidebar is not joking when it says exercise is the #1 ""cure"" for withdrawals. I will reiterate: I have absolutely NO withdrawals AT ALL. THEY AREN'T REAL. They're only real when your mind has nothing else to do. You need to occupy yourself with healthy activities, like exercise. Put on your running shoes, get on your bike, put in your headphones, and feel true happiness for the first time since you started taking this disgusting green sludge daily. You are going to get through it. 

And for those saying that somehow the withdrawals just ""haven't hit yet for you"", you are wrong. I have tried quitting before without exercise. It failed every time. I would withdrawal if I didn't take a dose in 3 hours. Cold/hot sweats and everything. You have to push yourself hard physically to make up for your months/years of getting that feeling for free. You have the power to do this. We are going to make it guys. God bless.",5,0

Over the weekend my buddy from out of town was visiting, and I drank pretty heavily and smoked some weed with him as well. This was not good for my brain. Alcohol has a completely different effect when your brain is drained of feel good chemicals from abusing kratom. Instead of feeling bubbly and happy I felt dysphoric, and even wanted to use. This would not happen in my sober mind.

Ever since this experience I’ve felt feelings from God reaching out to me telling me to stay fully sober. I haven’t drank since. Alcohol has caused me many problems in the past, and I find it hard to slow down once I start. Alcohol is actually the reason I tried kratom because after I got a dui I wanted to quit drinking. Well, that turned into a couple years of abusing both substances as well as pot. 

I’ve realized I’m much too early into recovery to be dabbling in these substances, so I’ve decided I’m going to go 100% sober. I’ve done this in the past, and actually found some peace within it. It’s hard at first, but if I stick to it, I believe my brain will thank me for it. It sucks because I just bought a bunch of delta 8 thc cartridges in hopes of helping me through the post acute part, but I feel my soul longing for sobriety so I can find myself. 

I know this may not resonate with everyone but even if it’s just one person that’s enough for me. I need to become closer to God and find my true self, because I’ve been lost in addiction too long. I’ve gone months without kratom or alcohol over the past 3 years but there’s always one thing that causes a relapse, either buying some kratom while drunk, or buying some kratom while hungover. I can’t risk putting myself into this viscous cycle again. Now I just need to kick these dang cigarettes. God bless all you, I’m forever grateful for this beautiful community, and I will always help anyone I can here because of the massive help I’ve received from you guys.

How I’m doing coming up on a week: the pink cloud has went away, I was very happy for the first couple days. Now I’m left with the cloudy depression feeling that has led to my many relapses. I’m ready to fight through this and get my life back but it’s just rough sometimes especially living alone.

Long post but I needed that off my chest. Any one of you can message me anytime and I’ll help however I can.

The healing that we anticipate going through after quitting kratom is largely based off of how we deal with the stress that pops up that used to make us take kratom. If you're anything like me, you're afraid of change and extremely introverted. The literal opposite of what it takes to fully heal after quitting kratom... But I am here to say 77 days in, it's not that bad. Whether you put the mental effort of healing yourself in or not, you're going to heal. I have done zero of the mental job of healing, and I'm still noticing changes for the better. 

Theses changes are quite literally infinitesimally small. Like for me, there are certain tasks that pop up that I am not motivated to do. And I find myself doing them and then later thinking ""wow, there is no way I would have gotten up to do that without kratom in my system..."" And that's why PAWS takes so long I think. Little by little we notice changes that may not be apparent at first, but we ARE getting better. At least for the mental part. Making it through the acutes for many others is a different story.

 For me the killer is anxiety and panic attacks. I still get them just about every day, but if I am being honest with myself, not nearly as much as I used to, and not for the same reasons that used to make me take kratom anymore. I got gobs of stress in my life, so anxiety and mental anguish should be not surprising. I'm just saying it's not so bad without kratom. In fact, I find myself more patient than I used to be while ON kratom. Which is crazy because kratom was something I used to take to GIVE me patience and motivation to do literally anything.

If you're laying around on the couch and fatigued, and not motivated to get up and do anything, just fucking get up and do it. Trust me, the internal fight I go through every day to get up and do just about anything at all, even go to the bathroom, is a super real struggle for me. But I always get up, and believe it or not I wake up doing it. We don't NEED kratom to wake up. We just need to do the things we were going to take kratom to wake up for...

For a lot of us, the solid mental understanding of ourselves that made us comfortable with making our kratom use our big secret SHOULD be enough to get ourselves out of it. I'm a firm believer that becoming a kratom user isn't a sign of weakness, in fact it was a drug that was more in line with my personality than anything else. But once it gets to a point where we take more and more because our old doses do anything, that's when it becomes a problem and we realize we are addicted. And the addicted portion of my kratom use was not necessarily to the drug itself, it was to having something I thought I could take that would make me feel better, and my stress seem okay. Which, if you ask me is a more dangerous addiction than anything. But here I am trucking along without it, and doing A-OK. Am I doing perfect? Absolutely not. But I'm not at the point anymore where I think I need to take something to convince me that I am. 

I'll take that, I'll take that any day. Stay strong people!",44,0

After 6 months I relapsed and was doing around 20-30 gpd for 1.5 years. Then I decided to quit cold turkey this time.

The first three days were pretty rough, I hardly got any sleep from the RLS. What really helps me the most with RLS is CBD cream, but Delta-8, epsom salt baths, and magnesium supplements also help me.

Day 4 the acutes got noticeably better and now on day 15 I feel almost no acutes, and haven’t for about a week, other than the occasional rls at night. However, the PAWS is definitely hitting me with a vengeance. 

I feel tired almost all day and am still struggling to get normal sleep (rls still tears it’s head every night but not as strongly) and everything just feels more difficult to do. I think suddenly shutting off the constant flow of opioids, stimulants, and dopamine (I’m also on day 15 of quitting nicotine, adderall, coffee, and alcohol, and starting a diet) that my brain was receiving has been a huge shock to my brain’s chemical balance.

Physically I feel pretty good, minus feeling a bit fatigued, but mentally I have a huge craving for junk food and anything sweet/fatty, since my body desperately wants the dopamine.

If you’re considering beginning your quit, whether ct or a taper, I highly encourage and recommend you do! I can already see my appearance dramatically improving from cutting out all the drugs, and life is starting to feel real again like how it once did around 8 years ago before I started using substances.

I know I still have a long road ahead of me of learning how to live without a constant flow of “feel-good” chemicals, but I’m truly committed to this path. I have already taken many risks that I would’ve otherwise been terrified to take while totally sober (mostly due to social anxiety) and substances were my crutch. 

I’m slowly proving to myself that I don’t need to be numb and on something to get through life, and that others like the REAL me: the me who I used to be before I started using, and not the high/drunk/numb one.

I’m choosing this path and nothing will stop me from staying on it, since deep down I’ve realized this is what I wanted all along, which is to face my biggest fears head on and become a truly wiser, happier, more fulfilled, and more “real” person, like who I once was many years ago.

Though I feel the PAWS pretty strongly, I am unbelievably proud of myself for actually quitting four different drugs all at once while also starting a new diet. The whole experience just feels so surreal to me: I took a major leap of faith into the unknown and through sheer grit and determination I have made it this far without the multiple crutches I so heavily leaned on to hobble my way through life. 

I still can’t believe that I’ve actually done it sometimes, since quitting all these drugs seemed like an impossible task to me but I’m proving to myself that I’m much more capable and stronger than I thought I was, and that feeling is better than any drug could offer. Sometimes I find myself crying from joy from how happy I am with the decision I made to quit everything cold-turkey and start facing life head-on like I used to before using.

Thank you all for reading, and I truly wish you the best of luck on your journey. Try to see this quitting process as an adventure: view every challenge as an opportunity to learn and grow, and as an experience you can look back on and be proud of. In the end life is just experiences, and if you’ve numbed yourself out the whole time then you’re only halfway living.",15,0

With a window of time off work to finally try a cold turkey, I tapered for a month to 13gpd and stabilized at that number for a few weeks, then jumped cold turkey (never tried CT before). I made it 76 hours without kratom but caved this morning at 4am, taking 2mg of suboxone as the sun was coming up after another night of tossing frenetically on the couch (RLS) all night with no sign of sleep in sight and another day looming. For so many reasons, I have to make this work, and will move forward with the CT because I have a golden window of time with no responsibilities, but want to know how having taken the sub will affect the acutes going forward--am I back to square one after the sub wears off, facing acutes from the beginning all over again, or will those 3 days count toward getting through kratom acutes?

&#x200B;

Here's my story followed by where I'm at and my question for those who might have experience for my question: I've been using Kratom with pretty much without a break for 5-6 years, averaging about 30 gpd, with a whole bunch of unsuccessful month tapers thrown in. I am desperate to get off this stuff for several reasons. So this time around, I set up a week where I don't have any obligations to cold turkey which I've never done before. 

I had tapered throughout mid May to June 19, ending up at 13 gpd. Then, Friday was my last dose and Saturday, Sunday, and yesterday I took no kratom. The days have been fine, other than feeling a bit antsy. I've been exercising and doing activities and actually getting productive stuff done during my cold turkey, and was feeling overall really good. Sneezing a lot and runny nose at times, but otherwise all 3 days I was feeling pretty happy and I managed to get productive shit done even. The problem has been at night when I can't sleep and all I can do is flop around with my legs moving every which way, feeling too hot or too cold. 

So this morning I screwed up--I was 76.5 hours in, and as 4am rolled around with no sleep in sight, the crushing thought of facing another day without any sleep was killing me. I tried to fight through it but caved and took 1 mg of suboxone (the suboxone was given to me a while back during a brief stint at an addiction treatment center where I went seeking help to get off kratom). I have not been a sub user at all, and had only taken it a few times months ago when I first tried to follow the addiction treatment center's advice and switch onto suboxone and wean down over a month to being clean of everything. That didn't work mainly because I didn't want to switch addictions (kratom for Suboxone which I know has even worse W/D. Cold turkey at the time wasn't an option due to my fear of feeling like dogshit at work as I didn't know what to expect with a CT. Now, I have this time where I can feel like shit, I just didn't expect the total lack of sleep. 

I feel disappointed in myself because I kept reading in this subreddit that, on average, after 4-5 days the kratom acutes will be mostly over and the sleep will start coming back, even if just 3-5 hours a night. 

I definitely am moving forward with this cold turkey, and will have to travel out of state to a beach house in 5 days. I'll be at an isolated beach house for 10 days. I am definitely not bringing any kratom or subs with me, so I will effectively be isolated from anything I can use which I think will be a good thing.  I just want to be able to sleep a little! While on kratom, I would typically take 50mg benedryl and melatonin each night before bed. My whole life I've been a night-owl, but my work requires me to wake to an alarm at 6:30am. I'm pretty used to getting 5 1/2 hours of sleep a night because I don't fall asleep until 2 am or so. I have stopped taking Benedryl since the kratom cold turkey though, as I've read it just makes RLS 10x worse and doesn't bring sleep. 

My question is, does the single suboxone undo the progress I made enduring withdrawals for 86 hours so far of no kratom? I am hoping to God that the 3 days cold turkey will still be progress toward getting through acutes. I know the suboxone will mask the acutes for the next couple days as it has a long half-life. I am going forward either way because I am so done with being physically addicted, but I am hoping this could be a blessing in disguise, rather than a setback. Or would it be like starting through the withdrawal all over again after the subs wear off? I understand everyone is different and no one can say how each person will react, but my thinking and hope is that because kratom has so many different receptors it hits, and suboxone apparently only has one, that maybe I will still be closer to being free as opposed to this being a setback to day 0 again. 

The thing that pisses me off is that the 86 hours was so do-able during the day, and I was feeling mostly pretty good, but the feeling of being so tired mentally with a body full of pent-up body energy for the third sleepless night in a row made me cave. 

I think the first two nights were easier because I had some gabapentin, along with tizanidine. Last night I was out of the Gabapentin, so I turned to all the other supplements I had that I learned about on here--Black Seed Oil, Magnesium, Valerian Root, melatonin, along with a few tizanidine. None of that (and I took a lot of Black Seed, Valerian, Magnesium, Vitamin C) seemed to help me get to a place where I could quiet my body enough to sleep. 

I just want to be done with this, and I'm pushing forward even though the nights have been hell. I won't use again, kratom or sub, and probably am looking for a bit of encouragement too, and a place where I can post my progress so it feels more real. As I said, I've been physically addicted to kratom for 5-6 years, and I can't wait to get to the place where my body isn't vibrating at night and I'm not dry humping at 60rpm on my couch, tossing and turning, just because there's so much leg energy. I have taken the advice of being active during the day and exercising too, and will continue to do so every day. I have found marijuana helpful too, but unfortunately not for sleep. 

On Friday I should get a small prescription of diazepam right before I leave for the flight, which I am hoping will help sleep when and if the acutes come back after this suboxone wears off. I also could go back to the local walk-in addiction treatment center and try to get more gabapentin--or anything else they'll offer me--that could help me at night to sleep even a little. I can easily survive if I can even get 3-5 hours of sleep a night. The thing that surprised me was how the three days without kratom were pretty easily manageable and I even was productive. There was no sign of PAWS, probably because I am in a very good situation in my life, looking forward to a lot of things, and have a loving significant other and family. I have a beautiful home, great job, several hobbies I am passionate about. I just want this damn kratom out of my life. I just want to get past the physical withdrawal. I want it so badly. I didn't intend to become enslaved to kratom, and at first, for maybe two to three years, it was great. I don't regret first those years, but the recent years have become this taper game where I taper down then fuck up the taper. I've done that so many times, which is why I need to do cold turkey and get through acutes. I even am fortunate that I have a window of time to do it now with no work or major responsibilities for the foreseeable future, and I know many don't have that period of time to just cold turkey and become an insomniac because they can't get around their daily work responsibilities.

The ironic part of me caving so I could sleep this morning at 4am is that I still haven't slept and now it's 11am. The restless legs went away, but I just couldn't fall asleep despite lying down for a few hours in bed hoping I would. At this point, if I fall asleep now, I'll probably wake up in the middle of the night, so my plan (at least at the moment) is to force myself to stay away and be productive today and find sleep finally tonight. 

Sorry that this went on and on, but I felt the need to invest in writing it out to solidify my intentions while also seeking advice on whether or not the progress I made getting through acutes for those three days will make it less awful at night when the sub wears off. Any and all advice, experience, wisdom and encouragement is appreciated, specifically if someone knows whether I've lost the hard-fought progress I made for 76 hours, which was the longest I've gone without kratom in years and years. I still haven't taken kratom and won't, so it's been 84 hours now without the plant. If you made it this far, thanks for reading such a long post--I appreciate it!",4,1

Begin to ask yourself why you are using kratom? What do you get out of it? Are you using it to solve any problems in your life? 

Each time you dose take a moment and right down your intention. Why are you taking kratom? What are your expectations? 

As you do this general patterns should emerge. For me it was that I was using kratom to numb emotional pain I didn't want to deal with nor knew how to cope with. And to self medicate my ADHD.

Most people fail at quitting kratom because they assume simply stopping is the solution. Then suddenly every problem they were using kratom to solve flairs up worse then ever. They can't handle it so they relapse. 

So, in order to succeed, you must identify these things and come up with a real viable plan to implement and solve these issues without kratom. 

Im currently at my all time record for abstinence and I really think this will be the quit that sticks. This is what I did differently this time. I highly reccomend it.",28,0

Even pushing my schedule closer to bed time isn't getting me sleep. Problem is im CT on delta 8 at same time. (Drug test coming up).

Gonna try some advice from someone here. Im spreading out my 8g throughout the day instead of one big one at the end of the day,  to see if that's more manageable, knowing that sleep is going to be spotty ANYWAY as my brain adjusts to no thc.

Just took 1 gram 15 min ago and feeling a bit of relief. 

I'll do 3g mid afternoon,  then do a 4 gram before bed.

Surprised that 1 single gram does anything. But again im just thinking in terms of what I used to need to feel high. But of course it's no longer about getting high. It's about feeling comfortable enough to keep the fight going.

243,2021-06-22 05:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/o5izv0/1_year_kratom_free/,1 year kratom free,"This past Saturday marked 1 year since the final time I used kratom. I used daily for over 3 years, 20-30gpd. I tapered for 7 weeks and when I got down to 3gpd I jumped. As I remember it, for me, acute withdrawals, at their worst was 3-4 days followed immediately (for me) by my first bout of PAWS. The worst part of WDs for me was insomnia, which in my case started the final week of my taper (which was a cue to me that I needed to jump when I did) and continued with 2-3 hours of broken sleep for the next month. 

I chose not to use any ""helper"" meds. That was my own personal choice. Everyone has to do whatever they have to do to quit themselves and what works for them. I tried Melatonin a few times early into Acutes and when it helped at all, it only served to help put me to sleep but not keep me sleeping, as I'd invariably wake up an hour later. CBD and Delta 8 help. Early on, even if they didn't help much with sleep, they helped to ease my anxiety about not sleeping and RLS enough that I wasn't *as* stressed and so much on-edge.

The worst bout of PAWS for me came between 40-50 days. The last significant bout of PAWS that I can remember was around 80 days. Just keep moving forward during these rough times and **don't use no matter what**! It WILL pass.

The key, for me, was **acceptance**. I had to ACCEPT the fact that I just wasn't going to sleep for a while. I had to ACCEPT feeling cold and wearing hoodie in 80 degree temperatures in the middle of summer. I had to ACCEPT the mood swings early on. 

The biggest things that helped me were Wim Hof Method breathing exercises, cold showers and exercising. I still continue those practices to this day. I exercise more now than I have in the past 15 years. The sedentary life is no longer for me. That type of ""living"", especially during my years addicted to kratom, was slowly killing me. For years I weighed around 300lbs. In recent months I've lost 35 pounds (so far) and eat healthier than I have eaten in decades. Every morning I walk / jog 60 - 90 minutes. 

I live with chronic pain now. Some days are worse than others. Some moments are worse than others. Thankfully, I rarely ever get the thought ""kratom will help with this"". I didn't start to get chronic back pain until mid-way or so through my kratom addiction. It eventually became a key motivator in getting me to quit. Within days of quitting, the crippling pain and immobility I was experiencing during the later days of my usage began to get better. It's never fully gone away but at least it's manageable now. I live with it. I have to... because **I never want to use kratom again... EVER!**

I don't complicate my recovery. I keep things as simple as possible. I try not to over think things. On the rare occasion that the thought of using kratom comes to mind, I recognize it for what it is: a LIE. I replace the LIE with the TRUTH (i.e.: ""I can never use kratom safely, moderately or recreationally."" Nor would I want to, if I'm honest about it.) Then I set out to attempt to help someone or just be productive in some way. Overall, in life, I'm not where I want to be (who is?) but I am a long way from where I was a year ago. Falling for a LIE that my addict brain tells me like ""It's ok to use just this once... You can control it this time..."", I believe, will put me right back where I was a year ago (seriously suicidal) if not worse. 

I just want to mention that this was my first time trying to seriously quit. I had many failed tapers along the way, but admittedly, those tapers were not about seriously wanting to quit FOREVER (more so for the intent of taking a so-called ""break""). Yes, we stay quit ""one day at a time"", but I had to get to the point where I never wanted to use that stuff ever again. I believe, if I have any reservations, eventually it will lead to relapse. That is my own personal belief for my personal recovery.

Lastly, no one can tell you how long withdrawal symptoms are going to last for you. It's YOUR brain and body. EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. Any attempt to do so is only a guess or that person's experience. Your mileage may vary. It's really a ""wait and see and deal with it accordingly"" type of thing. Withdrawals and quitting are not easy for most, but it is possible. Have **PATIENCE** with your brain and body. They are repairing themselves. The ""real"" work comes after Acutes. I believe anyone can quit. But staying quit must be the goal. This type of thinking works for me... It's the type of mindset that I personally choose to stick with.

Thank you to everyone who regularly participates in this subreddit and gives support to others. Don't let the experience of others deter you from taking a leap of faith and starting your own journey to recovery. For me, fear is an excuse... in every facet of my life. Come up with your own REASONS for quitting. And never forget those reasons. Most people don't ""get it"" the first time... or often, the first few times. The key is to **KEEP TRYING**. **NEVER GIVE UP! You CAN quit and stay quit.**",136,0

I haven't punched a hole in the wall in YEARS. (not that it's something to brag about per se, just to illustrate more of how far I thought I had come in terms of emotional coping skills)

Afterwards I'm crying, pulling my hair out, things I've rarely if ever done before because my brain is seized with fear and my amygdala is going into overdrive because of.....dropping a coffee mug.. Thank goodness my spouse came and talked me down. (Oversimplification)

Its been years since I've had an experience like this (PTSD related) but damn was it scary. These emotions that I'm no longer numbing are coming through full force, and I realize now more than ever to take to heart the coping skills my counselor and spouse have been teaching me. I feel I failed them in that regard today and I am mortified and embarrassed. However, I will not give up.

I'm not sure what the purpose of this post is even supposed to be, but I felt compelled to write it down somewhere. 

Thanks for your time and whoever you are, I love and believe in you.",4,0

Obviously I became addicted and now whenever I dont dose in the morning I definitely feel the withdrawals. I'm at work right now and I have kratom in my locker but I am not going to dose because this shit has too much of a hold on me at this point. I will suffer through the day, most likely not get any work done and not be able to sleep tonight. They expect me to clean and shit like nope not gonna happen, I feel like murdering myself or someone right now. 

Last time I went cold turkey I made it 5 days before I relapsed on beer due to the intense crippling depression that came from withdrawals. After drinking the beer I felt like shit the next morning so I took kratom to fight the hangover and the cycle continued for another 3 months. I think im finally done at this point.

What do you guys think, should I throw out the rest of my kratom and go cold turkey or try to taper?",2,0

**Backstory:**

I am taking kratom for maybe more than a year. Here in Czech Republic its getting more and more popularity and I am really happy that Kratom is not on list of drugs. My reasons for taking it was stress, depression and anxiety relieve, getting more energy, sex drive and being able to sustain more in bed, and especially for killing my lower-back pain lasting for more than 2 years. Trust me, Im 23 now and I literally have 0 motivation to live with depression, anxiety and pain in my back.

Its probably caused by inactivity, laziness and my work (Im delivery guy, so sitting 12 hours straight in car day by day was so common for me for long time until Ive got problems with back). So my doctor said I have some problem with SI-joints, showed me some stretches, I looked for some more on the internet and tried to excercise them. Usually It got better after stretching but next day was hell! So I decided try workout and strenghten my core, back, bottom and legs. Actualy it helped a little but on my shifts it was hell again as always.

**Story:**

On that painful 12 hours shift with my colleague, he remind me and told me a story about a shaman working with ayahuasca and human/nature energy that helped him and his ex-wife with much worse problems. This shaman is travelling around a world doing those ""sessions"" and in few months he\`s going to be here in my town. This is big opportunity for me to try this, I always wanted to be present on something like this or try ayahuasca, maybe solving my pain problem. He also said me that in order to be present on the shaman session I need to take about two weeks strict ""diet"" without salt, spices, some kinds of meat, drugs and ideally sex. That was little bit a problem for me as a kratom user so...

I\`ve decided to stop taking kratom as fast as possible. I know, session is going to be in few months, but I also know that my discipline is really bad and my many tries to stop taking kratom ended as I wanted to. I have motivation, so I needed a plan. In the past I read on (I guess this) subreddit about taking psylocibin shrooms (microdosing) to got over kratom using.

The day after I taked my usual 4g morning dosage and gone to work. After I started to feel the need for another dose in the noon (slight tremors, RSL), thinking about all of that I decided to take mikrodose of shroom instead. Half of the shroom was right to feel it and not end up tripping while driving a car! I was so happy it worked! But in the evening I started to feel withdrawals (butterlfies in the stomach, tremors, RSL, fatigue) making me to eat quarter of shroom which helped. But in the night I woke up a lot, 3-4 times, maybe caused of the summer heat as well. Also I remembered a lot of crazy dreams! 

(BTW At the end of dreaming Ive got paralised knowing I am still in dream and cant do nothing to wake up. So a woman showed up telling me that I should try to smile and clench my smile/facial muscles. I tried it few times and it actually worked so give it a try! xD )

At the day two of my quitting journey (yesterday when Im writing this rn) I started with 2g dose in the morning and eating 3/4 of small shroom again. This night I was waking up in the night craving for 1g dose to get to sleep, having crazy sleep and dreams again. 

Today (day 3) Im feeling very happy that it worked so well, I experience usual withdrawals like RSL, food and kratom cravings, diarrhea, bad mood and temperature feel-swings. NOT SO BADLY AS I CAN REMEMBER LAST TIME THO. Also I can confirm keeping me busy, workout and being outside/in the nature is the best for psychological withdrawals, tremors and cravings for kratom.

Good luck all of you there strugling as me to quit!

**TLDR: I was able to lower my daily dosage from 10-15 gpd to 2-4 gpd within 2 days by microdosing psylocibin. NOT overcoming withdrawals but lowering them a little.**",3,0

It’s funny, I always engaged in over thinking to the point it was painful and just wanted my thoughts to go away, and I guess now it has which is extremely upsetting. I was at a family event where many people went to ivy leagues and I just couldn’t keep up with what they were talking about because of the kratom (I used to be good at those kinds of convos). I wake up in the morning with terrible anxiety and use within an hour to avoid it, but I can’t take feeling this stupid and insecure anymore.

Shout out to everyone on this sub.,"What a difficult journey it has been. I was a ~75 GPD user. Quitting kratom was one of the hardest things I've had to do in my life. I learned the hard way that kratom causes withdrawals on a work trip 3 years ago. I should have stopped then and there but I gave in because the RLS was so bad.

Eventually I realized that I was constantly hiding this kratom addiction. Always capping up powder whenever I had to go on trips or even be away from my apartment for longer than 6+ hours. It wasn't healthy, and I started to notice the withdrawal symptoms more and more...and more.

Around 7 months ago I decided to start a taper, I guess I'm too mentally weak to go cold turkey but man, RLS is awful. I tried several times to go CT but failed every time. There is a lot of useful information on this sub, so here are some of the best tips that I gathered from lurking here:

1. If you want to quit, you should purchase caps or cap the powder yourself so that you know exactly how much you are taking. I cheated several times using powder before realizing this was necessary.

2. Keep track of how much you are taking each day. Again, this is WAY easier if you are following (1). There is a useful taper guide in the wiki. Read it!

3. You're not taking kratom to get high anymore, you are simply taking it to limit the withdrawal symptoms. You don't need to be perfect when you are starting out. Take it as needed but try to take less every week or every other week. Tapering is a marathon and not a race.

4. When you inevitably feel like quitting is impossible and don't think that you can do it (happened to me tons of times), come to this sub for motivation. You can do it and there are a lot of people going through the same thing as you!

5. Plan to be done by the time you finish your remaining amount of kratom. Having it easily accessible will always be a problem when you are trying to quit.

6. Exercise and Black seed oil were fairly helpful for me. They helped me get over the 20 GPD hump.

I tapered all the way from 75 GPD to just 1/2 gram at night so that I could get some sleep. Last week I stopped completely and have been withdrawal free. Finally sleeping without the help of kratom for the first time in 4 years and no more RLS. 

So anyways, shout out to this sub. Every time I wanted to give up I came to this sub and read everyones success stories and useful tips. Kratom withdrawal is seriously no joke so don't think you're the only one struggling so much. I'm only a week free but after this experience I know for sure that I will never go back.

I'm an alcoholic who still couldn't accept that he won't feel the same buzz ever again. I stopped drinking 3 years ago and started looking for a legal substitution almost instantly.

Problem #1: there aren't any legal substitutions to alcohol here, nothing. 

Problem #2: I abuse everything I try. I abused alcohol because I liked being drunk and confident. It was all fake but whatever.

I stopped drinking and I started abusing candy. Yeah, fucking candy. My sugar intake was through the roof. I drink so much coffee that it doesn't have any effect on me anymore. I just need it because my body is used to it.

Then I started looking for direct substitutions to alcohol: kava and kratom. Kava did nothing for me and it was really expensive so I ordered my first batch of kratom.. and I threw up on my first try. I overdosed because I didn't get the same buzz like I did with alcohol. The taste was also horrible. Tried it the second day and it was the opposite: very slight buzz but no vomiting. I finally found something that gave me a buzz and didn't get me in the poorhouse or jail! So I started abusing it as usual.

The buzzing effects were on and off. I had a big New Year's eve party planned and took my kratom and... nothing. Took more and still nothing. I was so disappointed. Everyone around me had a drink and a buzz and my kratom didn't work. I was devastated. I found out that dosing is almost irrelevant when it comes to kratom unless you take it on an empty stomach. I literally stopped eating during the day and only ate something at night. My appetite was gone and I lost 20 lbs in 3 months.

From that point my family knew what was going on even though I tried to convince them that kratom is a natural and harmless plant. I started taking it every day. It gave me a false sense of energy but I was also grumpy and rude to everyone around me. Can't explain why. People around me irritated me after I drank my dose. I felt like they were judging me when in reality they were only worried about me.

Then my money ran out and I couldn't take kratom for a few days. In those days I realized that I had the same cravings when I quit boozing. I was hungry and stepped on a scale for the first time, I lost 20% of my weight. I haven't had sex with my wife for 2 months because my drive was gone. When I tried to masturbate I couldn't finish. I had trouble peeing after a heavy dose.

So here I am. I decided to quit kratom because I kept using more and more and the positive effects were almost nothing compared to the side effects. I'm so tired now and I have to force myself to eat normally again. I'll be fine in a few weeks but it was not worth it. I have to accept that the buzz I'm looking for won't ever return. I have to improve myself on my own instead of expecting these substances to do it for me.",37,0

Well, that was unsuccessful.  My second go around with kratom I exclusively was only using “extract capsules”.  At the high (low) point, I was up to 10 extract capsules a day.  (Yes, it was expensive, but the money (and hundreds of other reasons as well) was my motivating factor for me to quit.  I successfully went from 10 extract capsules to 8, to 6, to 4, to 2, to 1 extract capsule a day.  It was rough but couldn’t imagine going cold turkey again.  I was stuck on one extract capsule a day for 3 days, but now it’s been 36 hours since I’ve ingested any kratom.  I don’t want to take an extract capsule today (or ever again).  

My question is:  I have some regular “non-extract kratom” capsules.  Is it worth it to take 2 grams?  1 gram? of “regular kratom”?  Obviously I still feel about 65%.  Definitely still have moderate symptoms of withdrawal.  I feel like if I had to I could just “jump off” and hopefully never take kratom again (I’ve said that before).

Also I’m in the process of tapering from a 6 month 15-20 gpd habit. Down to about 10 gpd now and planning on dropping 2-3 gpd every week until off of it. Cutting dose on fridays so as to avoid having the withdrawal symptoms during the work week. Does this seem like a decent taper?

Granted for no more than a week to prevent WD symptoms from them. Just glad to be among the rest of you who have quit/are quitting. We got this!!",8,0

I had a relatively painless acute withdrawal stage, probably because I was taking it for mood/depression reasons at such low doses. But I am definitely experiencing a rough PAWS as my brain works to find equilibrium, which includes just a general empty feeling and general loss of pleasure. It's like an overall depressive phase but more so the bored kind of depression over the sad kind. (I'm more used to the sad kind pre-kratom!)

Anyways, I'm a writer who wrote nearly 2 books last August-January with the goal of finishing book 2 and 3 this summer. I also decided to quit kratom... so now I'm feeling that horrible, classic addict feeling of ""can I really do this without \[insert drug of choice\]?"" And I'm being horribly self-critical of what I've already written because my brain wants to convince me I only \*thought\* it was good while kratom-high and in reality it actually sucks. So yeah. I'm trying so hard to get the creative juices flowing and I feel more and more like shit the harder I try. I just want to feel how I felt when I was writing back then... and I can't tell how much of that was actually due to kratom or if I was on a creative high all on my own, and I don't feel it now because of the PAWS.

Sorry if that ramble was a little all over the place! I just want to know if anyone else is having these struggles with creativity and PAWS. I've written books sober before, so I know some of what my brain is telling me is a lie. I'm just struggling so much with doing all these external actions like exercise/reading/meditating to feel better and my brain still being completely unable to give me any pleasure from them. Feels like I'm playing life on Extra Hard Mode right now. But I really REALLY don't want to relapse. I just want to feel better.",10,0

Daily 10 year Kratom user, 15 gpd average here. I recently tapered for about 8 months, and quit completely on 5/4 last month. I have had no ill-effects/withdrawals aside from sneezing and what I consider the most awful of them all--stomach issues. 

I know that irregular movements are common after quitting and can last for months. I have read many posts from others who have endured for 3+ months with diarrhea, cramps, gas & bloating. I've experienced all of the aforementioned for about a month and a half now (pretty much since I quit completely) on a daily basis. 

Apologies in advance for TMI here: some days the diarrhea is terrible, others it is just very loose but not full on liquid. Some days I have really bad cramps/gas (but not as often as the diarrhea/general loose stools, which happen quite literally every day).

Things I've tried:

I have been on probiotics for the past 4 weeks. Recently switched brands to ""Physician's Choice 60 Billion CFU"". I cannot tell if these are making much of a difference as I've said, some days the diarrhea is just pure liquid.  


I try to eat lots of soluble fiber and stay hydrated.  


I've taken imodium yesterday because it was quite bad, today I am OK, but it isn't full on solid, it is very soft.  


I am starting some Metamucil 3-in-1 pills today.  


The reason why I want to hear from those who have quit and have experienced these symptoms on the long term is because I want to know if there is a light at the end of the tunnel. For those of you who quit 6 months ago, did your bowel movements ever go back to normal? How about those who have been clean for a year?   


I hate being like this so goddamn much, to the point that although I have no Kratom cravings whatsoever, I am considering getting back on it just to avoid the stomach issues--I was regular as clockwork before, and going to the bathroom sometimes 4 times a day with just pure liquid absolutely sucks.

Your input is much appreciated.",23,0

My kratom use was never unreasonable, b/c I needed it to function at a high level in order to prolong my beloved dog's life.  The dog eventually passed, leading to crippling depression.  And now, there is no longer a reason to take the kratom.  I was beginning to develop serious chest pains from pushing my body so hard for 2 months.  At most, I was taking 30 grams/day.  After a week of tapering, I'm down to 14 grams per day.  The only withdrawal symptoms I have are psychological/emotional disturbance and extreme fatigue.  I no longer get cold sweats or anything since following a lectin-free diet combined with intermittent fasting.  I believe that most withdrawal symptoms come from the gut and that what causes withdrawal are the die-off symptoms of microbes that break down kratom or whatever other substance.  As those microbes die, the body must filter them out.  So taking things like activated charcoal, marshmellow root and other kidney detox herbs has kept all classical withdrawal symptoms at bay.  

I wish I could cold turkey, but I think that myself and many others fail to realize that cold turkeying is damaging to the brain, kidneys, and heart.  A young healthy person will not notice...they will just experience withdrawal in a general way, but those with other health problems will notice that withdrawal can cause chest or kidney pain.  

There are a lot of kratom substitutes, so i figure out what aspect of the kratom withdrawal is bothering me and then take the substitute.  If I have general pain, I will take a curcumin supplement.  If I think it is a dopamine related issue, I will drink coca tea or take 1/2 tsp of l-dopa powder, intellect seeds, etc.

In addition to tapering off kratom, I am extending my water fasting window, which is at a pathetic 6 hours, 30 min.  The goal is 18 hours water fast, 22 hours low calorie/liquid fast, then eat once a day.  I want to be off all psychoactive substances for at least thirty days and complete as long of a water fast as possible.  For those stuggling with depression, fasting works wonders.  I'm hoping to beat the ""PAWS"" with an extended fast and maybe microdosing some magic mushrooms.

The most difficult thing is that I've had no ambition to do anything.  Perhaps someone can give me advice.  My lack of ambition comes more from my underlying depression than from kratom w/d, b/c when my dog was still alive, I did not operate or perform tasks based on emotions but on what logically needed to be done in order to prolong her life.  Keeping her alive took up all of my time for a few months.  I try to go back to activities I used to enjoy, but they are failing to grow on me.  There seems to be no real purpose to do them.  I realized during my last spiritual journey, that my primary motivation in life - along with 99% of everyone else is to do things that make us \*feel\* important.  So now I ask myself the question, ""what is the reason why I'm doing this?  Is it to feel important or impress someone?  Why?  Who cares?""  I believe a person finds themselves more when they give themselves selflessly, but it seems hard to establish such a new and profound habit while going through w/d at the same time, esp when #1 symptom is lack of focus/brain fog.",2,0

About a week and a half ago I was hammering about 45 gpd. (Originally thought it was about 30, until I bought a digital scale.) I decided a night later last week that when I took my night dose that I was done. I made it until Sunday night, and didn't sleep for a few days, and ended up taking a very small amount. Within 25 minutes I was sawing logs. I woke up the next morning and took another small dose to help get me going with work and decided that CT wasn't for me this time.(I quit about a year ago CT from around 40gpd and even though it was hell, I got through it.)

Monday when I got home from work I went and bought a digital scale. I weighed out an approximate dose of what helped me sleep the night before and it was around 2.5 so that's what I went with. I've been doing 3 doses per day: a dose about an hour after I wake up(so about 5:30am), a dose at about 1:30 pm, and a dose about an hour before bed. I hung at 2.5g for 3x a days for a couple days and then just dropped .1g off each dose after. Yesterday's middle of the days dose was 1.7g and I did 1.6g for bed. My alarm woke me up for the first time in about a week and a half!

Just wanted to share a positive taper post. I don't know why or how but even only taking about a tenth of what I was taking 10 days ago, I feel better than I have in years! I'm sure some of it's positive energy from quitting and my taper being successful so far.

So anybody that wants to quit, can't CT, and is worried about tapering just find a schedule that works for you. Take it as slow or fast as you need to but don't rush it. You can do this! I'm going to try and run my taper the whole way to 0.

Best way to stop?,"Hello, I am 25 years old. I've been under tremendous stress in the last 4 years. I've become addicted to Benzos (Probably about 4mg of Clonazepam a day). I was once taking 100 Xanax bars a day in powder form, but I've managed to bring myself down to a reasonable dosage. I am a caregiver for my dad with Lewy Body Disease. I started using Xanax as a way to cope with the overwhelming stress. Recently, my dad has become extremely violent (He's 57, so he's still quite strong). I suffer from three herniated discs from a car accident I had as a child and I'm lucky to be alive. I've irresponsibly relied on Kratom and Benzos to help me with my physical pain, and to numb my emotions because otherwise I would have already gone crazy. I am now taking about 60g a day but it tea form. I filter three times, and throw out all of the Kratom once the Alkaloids have been dissolved in the tea, so I'm not ingesting 60 grams of crap. Still, during the past week, I've been dealing with very a severe kidney ache on my Right side. I will be honest, I have not been hydrating very well. I've suffered from constipation and I ocassionally also use Benzedrex. I know I have to stop that shit. I always forget to hydrate properly to the point where my lips are completely cracked and I can't even spit. I also have a tooth that is rotting in my mouth but I can't afford to get it fixed. It constantly becomes infected and I wake up spitting blood. I've tried Cold Turkeying Kratom but not even Xanax or Klonopin help my Restless Leg and Arms. Also, I live in California and the heat is insane. I cannot sleep and I'm sure my pain is due to my Kratom abuse and not properly taking care of myself. I'm in a self destructive state of mind and I need to change it. I simply don't know how to even start. I've been drinking Horsetail tea, trying to hydrate, drinking Liquid IV, but I can't avoid Caffeine. Any tips would be appreciated.  I never want to touch Kratom alone, but In experiencing bad WD that affect my ability to sleep, or care for my sick father. Am I seriously consuming over +60 grams of Kratom even if I make it into tea and throw all the powder after? Is tea the same as the toss and wash method? I tried CT but I couldn't handle it because my arms and legs were extremely restless and the heat here is at over 110°. I lasted two days before I started taking 30g a day. It seem to help the pain while it's working, then after the pain kicks my ass. I feel like a 90 year old getting out of bed. What sound I do? I'm worried about my kidneys, but I can't CT Kratom Because I have to be level to care for my father. Would a rapid detox with the help of Benzos and extreme hydration help me better than a month long taper? I had a job opportunity and I had to miss it because I've been stuck in bed for days. Yes, I fucked up. I wasn't thinking, but now I'm here. Any help would be greatly appreciated because at this moment I feel completely lost. I don't even know where to start. You can be mean to me, I understand. I simply want to know that I'll be okay and if someone can help me get off this I would be eternally grateful. I love you my fellow brothers & sisters. I came here because I trust you to not judge me for my mistakes as I already know that. I simply want to get off Kratom. Even if it takes months, I need to do it. I would prefer CT, but that hasn't worked for me so far. Also any supplements, products that can help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, I hope you guys can help guide a lost soul towards sobriety. My Benzo habit is under control, but I do know I'll need rehab for that. I need to tackle Kratom first before I check into Benzodiazepine rehab, which unfortunately is not available in my area. I need to cough up thousands of dollars that I don't have. I'm taking one at a time. I really appreciate any tips and recommendations. Only here, do I feel I can be honest and not be lectures by others for being a moron. I already know that. Anyways, I hope to hear from you guys soon because I'm losing my mind here. Thanks everyone. Take care, peace and love 💕",2,1

So far each day is slightly better, like 5-10% better than the last. My big symptoms are low energy, low motivation, easily fatigued, annehdonia.

Not sure if anyone remembers but I was writing on here semi-frequently about kicking K and going on a cross country road trip. Well, the trip is over and I’m home bound. I’ve been thinking about using a lot. Getting comfortable on the couch after all that hiking and camping and just nodding off with a few reds. God, I don’t wanna go thru PAWS again (honestly still going thru them). The cravings really come in waves, and they ebb and flow. The whole time I was in the woods under the stars I loved being sober. Not that I’m back to work, school and everyday responsibilities I want to fade off into sweet gas station heroin oblivion.

Background: PTSD, depression, and seven plus years clean from the ravages of several years of whiskey, crack, and meth addiction. On day 7 of a 14-month addiction to kratom. The most I've had clean in a long time.

I am an addict. What does that mean? Aren't we all? Yes, and no. There are the cellular and spiritual components of addiction. If we use heroin, for example, over an extended period, all of us will become addicted at the physical level. After detoxing, the normal person will evaluate the harm and never go back. The addict, however, remembers that wonderful first high and it's only thru attending to the damaged spirit will they truly be free. It’s definitely a lifelong process. The drunk, the tweaker, the junkie, the addict almost immediately falls in love on first use. Their road to recovery is a bit more of a burden ...it is what it is :)

Putting the initial WD time between you and K is essential (Thank you Captain Obvious), or any drug for that matter. Some do treatment centers, others prescriptions, still others simply raw-dog it. We taper, CT, attend AA / NA, stay with friends or family. We get thru hell-week; then what? The triggers, the craves, PAWS. We will each have varying degrees of ""Staying power"", and my hope is that each of us succeed and free ourselves from the bondage of self and live 100% addiction-free.

My collapse has almost always been - ""Damn, I feel great. It's Friday and I crushed it this week; lemme treat myself."" Friday turns into the weekend and in two weeks I'm back where I was. I kicked some pretty wicked stuff in the past, and now, as I stated, into day 7. I'm using armodafinil to cut the cravings. It comes with it's own side effects and addictive qualities; however, I've used armodafinil in the past and can drop it fairly easily - simply toss my remaining and get thru the next 24 / 48 hours.

I'm genuinely over being stupid, unable to learn or focus. I'm tired of vomiting, being weak and vulnerable, and feeling like garbage all the days. This sub has been a huge encouragement and I am grateful. It's time to live up to my potential again.

Blessings to you all for your courage to face this beast, and for sharing your battles and victories.

Also discovered one thing. I experimented with these tobacco less nicotine pouches to see if the stimulation should help. 

It did for about 10 minutes,  then discovered that it started to reveal the underlying withdrawals my body is dealing with. Like I felt them stronger than before I took the pouch. That's weird.

Thank you all so very much for being there when I need you! I've learned so much about my symptoms by just digging around in here. At first I had no idea that my night sweats were from the Kratom!

I've been a daily K user for 2 years now, but when I started I found it when I had gallstones and was in a lot of pain and the doctors wouldn't give me anything for the pain, so I sought out **CBD** and K of which did the trick. I cured myself naturally of **gallstones**, by the way, but that's another topic post! (I'm very well educated with natural remedies so my house has always been like an apothecary).

I took K during the healing of my body when I was doing a lot of cleanses, I wasn't using it daily so I didn't build a tolerance, I only used it on very bad days and didn't even have that much to begin with when I bought it. Then I got better and had the K sitting around in the back cabinet and would occasionally pull it out and try some but only once in awhile because it made me extremely dizzy in the beginning.

Then I moved cross country for work and never started taking it until a good 2 years later when I began I was going through a lot of stress (and still am!) so it's been tremendously helpful, yeah it's a crutch but one thing it did do was help me stop drinking. I had picked up a bad habit of **drinking** a bit too much when I moved and so I was really trying not to because I had just come from a major health stressor with the gallstones (of which I suspect was tied to alcohol) so overall I gradually stopped drinking over the last year which has been great, however on the other hand my K dosage has increased.

I began with just something like 10g once a day and then after a few months that went up to 2 doses a day and I was riding on that for awhile and then I lost my job and it went way up to something like 50g per day. I have been fluctuating from around that to something like 35g per day. I guess I found my sweet spot at 3 times a day and 12.5g per dose = 37.5g daily. (I think the math is correct). So, I have been running with that for months but here or there would go up some due to outer stressful events and then back down to the 3 a day. (I've lost 3 jobs in the last year and currently unemployed)

What I find odd is that some time last year when I was having a pretty steady daily dosing, I began having **night sweats**. I would wake up in the puddle of water and have to change my clothes and even sheets. I can still never figure out what is going on and what I did to cause them because sometimes I will take over the amount I normally take and get them and then not get them when I take less. It's like they are so random and really annoying! I normally sleep on a towel because this happens often. Does this happen to any of you? How do you stop them? Any tips for getting them to stop?

As I mentioned in my previous post, I have lost half of my head of **hair** during the last 2 years and it falls out daily and constantly and I know it must be from the K. It has a dull lifeless feeling, just like how K turns you inside. I want my hair back!

Then I began getting a constant low grade **nausea** daily that I have been living with. I hate it, it's horrible. Then if I happen to take too much or with not a lot of food I vomit. And let me tell you, I have lost a lot of weight because I just stopped eating meals. I snack here and there on small stuff but I am never hungry and it makes things worse because I end up like this;

&#x200B;

*Wake up - Morning dose + coffee & no food whatsoever*

*Midday - no lunch but maybe a handful of crackers or a bowl of cereal.*

*Dinner - often skipped or often a small snack.*

*I either get sick and vomit or then I move into the next day and I vomit due to not enough food in my system.*

&#x200B;

It's so strange how I have completely lost my **appetite** as I normally can eat and over eat! Also, when I do eat it's as if the K has dulled my taste buds completely. Not fun. I will also add that I am in general a really healthy eater, but over the last year I haven't had much drive to eat that healthy and I know it's due to the K and loosing my appetite, or just the blah you get from taking it daily. But now I would say I'm borderline **anorexic**.

Then there is the **vertigo**. It really only happens if I go over the typical 3 doses a day, I began to feel dizzy when I turn my head to look behind me. Talk about not being able to drive when I'm like that! Which is why I lowered my doses to try and keep it at 3 a day (give or take around 40g day).

Now let's talk about the **constipation**. Such fun! I take on a daily basis all of these just to poop;

*Pau D'Arco (stool softener & also anti-viral)*

*Cascara Sagrada (colon cleanser, it is not addictive and I've taken it for years, love it)*

*Magnesium Oxide/Triphala blend*

*Vitamin C 500mg*

*Omegas*

&#x200B;

I've never been on opiates as I have lost a few cousins to them (yeah, a few, quite tragic) and never plan to try them, so my experience has only been with Kratom. I have lived a life with extreme **anxiety, panic attacks, CPTSD and depression** so when I found it for the physical gallstones pain it also helped with these things as well and I don't take any medications for the anxiety/depression etc. so it was such a relief to find K. Then fairly recently I discovered that I have ADHD and was tested and I very much so have it. I began researching it and have had a major shock that I never discovered this earlier as now I am 44 years old as I feel as if I have lost so many years due to not knowing I had been suffering from it. The K in the beginning really helped me to focus, but over time that fizzled away, but I do get a good focus on an occasion. If those of you who have generalized anxiety and can't seem to source why you can't get help for it and you have done everything under the sun to treat it with all the natural supplements or even medications and you are still anxiety ridden, I would suggest looking into **ADD/ADHD**. It gets a really bad rap because many people do not understand it and many people dismiss it entirely. Just thought I would add that as I have read tons of posts on here and it does seem like a lot of people are suffering from depression and anxiety who turn to K.

Anyway I'm really wanting to quit as all of these bad side effects are really taking their toll but I'm also unemployed so I need to be feeling good when I am doing interviews and starting a new job, whenever that will be, so I think I'm going to just do a taper. I'm looking into getting treated with stimulants eventually, since they are the option for ADHD so I want to be clean from K before I do that. I am just so scattered and I need help and the K is not helping like it use to in the beginning. I know some of you are also on things like **Adderall** and **stimulant meds**, so please feel free to comment on your experiences and with or without taking it with Kratom.

I'll try and keep an update on my progress here.

Yesterday I lowered my dose to only once a day from the average 3 and today I went most of the day without it until around 6pm where I took 1 dose and decided that I will do a taper. I'm going to try and roll with 1 dose per day for awhile before jumping.

So, that's my story I thought I would share, hopefully it will be helpful if needed. I think I covered it all. K has been a blessing at times and it has been turning into a big curse and I want it to now end so that is my plan and it starts with the taper.

Please feel free to comment, make suggestions or send me a message.

Thanks for reading!

Adding some more info I forgot to mention: Other major things that have changed since I started high doses daily is **tremors**, where I find my hands shaking from out of nowhere. Also, my **period** has almost vanished.

Still having lingering symptoms like upper right abdomen discomfort/pain and red eyes. Talked a lot more about these symptoms in my previous posts. The symptoms are all getting better except these few. 

I have been eating extremely healthy and exercising a lot, but still nervous as to what these pains could be. I haven’t had any alcohol since quitting, but I really want to get a couple drinks with friends. I’m just nervous that if it is something wrong with liver/kidneys/gallbladder that drinking could hurt them even more.

During the pandemic, I started taking it more often, often with a few drinks.  I found that the combination complimentary and, since reaching a pleasant level of intoxication required less alcohol, it was a way to avoid alcohol hangovers which for me have always been terrible.  Gradually, it went from on occasional getting high in the evening to taking it some afternoons to run.  Nowadays, I have a really hard time running without it; it is just an unpleasant experience all around and that makes it nigh impossible to motivate myself.  In January of 2021, I stopped drinking cold turkey (not a problem besides boredom, thankfully) but I have found that I take kratom most days now.  I don't think I have never taken more than 30 g and most days it is in the 10-15 range.  Some days, I'm happy with about 5.  If I exercise, I take about 5 g in the afternoon and I generally take another 5 or 10 in the evening.  If I do not exercise, I just take 5-15 in the evening, depending on the day.  The quantities have not changed in months and I still find the taste repugnant.  I take a day off most weeks but I have not had more than one day off at a time in maybe 3 months.  

Every time I take a day off (or a couple of days off as I used to do), it's not so bad.  Insomnia, my allergies come back, minor aches and pains, feeling generally unmotivated.  It is frankly difficult to say whether this is withdrawal or just a return to my relatively-depressed middle-aged self.  I'm allergic to a lot of plants where I live and I have always had insomnia.  Frankly, this plant has been very helpful during the pandemic since it was a way to get motivated for exercise, house work, and job work.  It also helped me chase away the weekend boredom that came with stopping drinking.  But, it impacts my quality of sleep and keeps me up for at least six hours after the last dose.  With things improving pandemic-wise (hopefully), I will have to return to the office soon and I am just not sure what to expect  in terms of quitting and I hate feeling high in public so I know I will have to cut it out.  Should I just suck it up, take a week off and power through the withdrawal symptoms or should I do a controlled taper?  The latter will likely be difficult because my relationship with kratom changes day to day.  Some days, I am incredibly grateful for it giving me functionality that I probably would not have had after being locked up for a year.  I also have less anxiety the day after taking it.  Other days, I notice that I'm a little high most days (and feel the gastrointestinal side effects) and it bothers me, which leads to a higher level of anxiety.

Has anyone had experience with quitting after a similar use pattern?  I haven't found the motivation to stop it yet because on the whole it is still useful but I know I would like to make moves in that direction in the near future.",9,3

The pain feeds into exhaustion which feeds into chronic fatigue. It's a vicious cycle.  

It may sound like an exaggeration but in the last 55 days without Kratom my life has changed dramatically for the better! The problem is that this pain is nearly unmanageable without proper meds or Kratom. Trust me, I'm fully aware of PT and stretching and exercising, I've been studying how to mitigate this pain for years. I am going to try to push through. I don't really know why I'm posting here other than to rant and let out my frustrations.

If you aren’t up for a heavy workout just do something light! Even walking outside. After working out I feel so much better, I have a positive mind for the day.

After working out, I know it sucks but I made myself take a cold shower. You can start the water off hot and just slowly lower it until it’s cold. This way you don’t have to deal with the shock to your body. Man, getting out of that cold shower after a workout I felt reborn. I’m currently making a smoothie and some breakfast then I’m gonna go get some sunshine and chill outside. I take a multivitamin, ashwagandha, green tea complex, and L-theanine for the day.

This sub has a wealth of info and a great support system, but I have always found the most help in anecdotal reports, so here's mine!  This is pretty long so TLDR at bottom.  Here's my taper journey from about a kilo/month (however much that is per day) and literal spoonfuls every hour or so, to dosing a small scoop every 7 hours.  I've been a user for 5 years and kilo/month for about 4 of those years.  I knew it was time to quit when I started planning activities and times that revolved around the K.  I would always travel with a backpack and water bottle, and always had to pee.  The worst it got was when I couldn't sleep more than four hours at night without waking up with withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, panic, RLS, general discomfort).  

Taper Plan - 

I haven't measured it out accurately, but it's the same dosage every time.  It's a small spoon (don't know the size, tsp maybe?).  My general plan was/is to increase the time between doses by an hour every Monday.  For example, I started by taking a dose every two hours (this was a struggle!).  After a week, I increased the wait time to 3 hours between doses.  Following this plan, I am now at 7 hours in between doses.  Next week will be 8, and so forth.  Ultimately, once I get to 12 or 13 hours, I will basically be on a once per day dosage.  Last I checked (2 years ago), the resources for this sub has a taper plan that works in a different way; keeping time the same but reducing amount of K.  However, this is currently working for me and I am happy with it.  

My experience and notables -

1.  Addiction transforms you into a zombie.  Obviously, not literally, but you create systems in your life that revolve around your addiction.  Many times these systems are sub conscious and sort of just become a part of your routine.  For example, I would purposely not eat all day so that I wouldn't get tired and could sort of potentiate the K.  Another big one for me is simply leaving the house.  Leaving the house without a scoop or two is scary.  Sounds so silly, but this is exactly what I mean.  Addiction takes away your control and stacks habits in your life that revolve around getting ""high"".
2. It seems daunting but get's easier.  It's hard to believe that only a month or two ago I was struggling to wait 3 hours to dose.  I would literally sit and watch the clock in anticipation for my dose.  Now, with a 7 hour plan, three or four hours seem like nothing.  I dose at my time and I forget about it and go do whatever.  A few hours go by and I check the clock to see the ETA of my next dose, but I just accept it and move on with my day.  I try to treat my relationship with K in a business-like manner, not looking to ""get"" anything from it, just recognizing that for now it's a part of my life.  Around hour 5 or 6, I start to get the yawning and sniffling that I used to get at hours 2 and 3 a few weeks ago.  I can't wait until I am taking 1 dose and 1 dose only.  
3. Don't look at it like you're trying to ""stop taking kratom"".  Instead, look at it like you are reinventing your life.  For me, I find that it is much more motivating to view this stage of my life as one of growth rather than reduction.  Framing is important, everything is perception.  I can lull in the misery of no longer being able to enjoy the high that K once gave, or I can be excited for the new stage and better version of myself.  
4. Holistic change.  Sort of related to the previous point, don't look at K as being an isolated practice.  Audit your life and use this major mental shift to reflect on how you can better yourself in general.  For example, I drew out all the aspects of my life and envisioned what the best version of me would look like (financial, marriage, parenting, wealth building, social, recreation, etc.).  This point may not be directly related to K, but I find that by approaching your life through this lens will help to alleviate the hollowness that may be felt when K is no longer around.  
5. Meditation.  This really should be number one.  I'm not going to go into the science or testimony for it.  There's an infinite amount of data and articles on it.  Meditation has helped take me to a whole new level.  The biggest change for me with meditation is my increased willpower/discipline.  I am able to recognize when I am acting out of habit, versus being present.  
6. This to shall pass.  I have had all the same ups and downs that many report when trying to walk away from the K.  I've sat on my couch and pondered life, or felt mild anhedonia.  My sleep's been weird, and my anxiety has been tough.  HOWEVER, thanks in large part to this sub, I know that all these things will pass.  This is where meditation really helps.  With meditation, I have been able to recognize when I get lost in my thoughts and although in that moment I may feel depressed, I can take a step back and watch myself go through this with an understanding that this is temporary.    

There's probably a lot more I could put on here, but it's time to take my kids to the pool!

Thanks everyone for the support, love you all, every single one of us will overcome.

Can't decide to taper or go CT, need advice!","A bit graphic warning here. I have been on K for something like 2 years now, daily and it went from once a day to 3, 4, 5, 6 times a day dosing at 15 grams each, so I was generally around 45 grams per day on average. 

Over the last year I have had the random bouts of ""the sweats"" and at first had no idea what was going on and thought it was from the K but couldn't figure out why as I hadn't changed much about my dosing. So they come and go and I suspect they come when I ingest a new strain so it causes my body to lack the alkaloids from the stain I had been taking therefore a wd happens and I start the sweats. 

Anyways, then there were ""the vomits"". I use to have a good appetite and was often snacking and hungry, K has turned me into an anorexic as it has completely taken away my appetite and I hardly eat!  On top of killing my taste buds completely, nothing tastes good or enjoyable. Blah. I have lost a lot of weight and I'm already thin. K is sneaky, you sometimes assume you think you know that you will be fine after taking it but all of a sudden you are in the bathroom vomiting. Over the last year I have had on average vomit sessions in the bathroom (thank god I was home each time!) on average once every few weeks and now, lately its been once a week. 

I can't anymore. Yesterday morning was my very last straw. I woke up had my morning dose and coffee, both on an empty stomach as usual and was half way through chugging the sludge and I ran to the bathroom and was projectile vomiting in the bathtub because it would have gone everywhere over the toilet. Projectile. Scary. I know it was because I hardly ate the day before and I was chugging sludge on an empty stomach. So gross. All the other times I vomit is when I start to feel nauseous and I know it's coming, but this time was instant which is different. Last straw here. Talk about ruining your day to wake up to that! 

Oh and lets talk about the hair loss. I have lost half of my head of hair since I started K daily. I've heard others talk about this, it is TRUE. Run far away from this plant because it will destroy. I am so sick of pulling loose hair off my head and living in a sea of hair all over my floor. I have to vacuum every day because of it, well actually I don't vacuum daily because K has taken away every bit of motivation and has turned me into a lazy person. I'm over it. I'm done. I'm in the process of trying to get a job (been struggling since early last year so K has been my go to) but now that I'm so over this stuff I need to get back to a normal life. I'm sick of feeling sick. I have low grade nausea all the time! No wonder why I can't eat! 

So, after yesterday morning I was like, that is it, I'm DONE. However I'm scared of the wd. I only took 2, well almost 2 doses yesterday. The morning one probably all came out so I guess it was 1 dose. I made it to about 1pm and I was having a headache and chills were starting and the lethargy is already in place. I took the dose and felt better but the chills were still there, oh and the anxiety is amped up. 

I was also noticing the leg twitches happening. I slept last night because I took some Melatonin and Hydroxzine. I was reading that Hydroxzine helps people with opioid wd. I sleep most of the night, woke up once covered in sweat as expected and changed closed and passed back out. 

I have an arsenal of natural supplements to take as well to try and get through this but I'm trying to figure out if I should taper or just go CT. 

***My question is, how long will the WD's last? I can't seem to find any threads on here about how long someone at 45g per day going CT will the wd's last?***  *-****or- if I taper over the course of a few weeks does that mean I'm going to be living with ""the sweats"" for weeks?***  I HATE  the sweats! so annoying to be freezing cold and covered in sweat and can't get your temperature even.

Woke up today with some cold sweat and chills but forced myself to get on my bike for 30 minutes then lifted some weights after that. Also forced myself to go on a 3 mile hike before work. Then worked 8 hours. And here I am, I made it back to my bed finally ha! I’m totally exhausted but I think the exercise really helped me have a good mindset today. There could definitely be some pink cloud effect in play but I’m just taking it and running with it for now. I’m prepared to deal with PAWS if it comes in bad this time, but we will cross that bridge when we get there. Today was a good day. 

Oh yeah worth mentioning, I had 1 beer with my friend today and it was a huge mistake. It was a buddy I haven’t seen in a long time so I rationalized having a brew with him, and instantly afterwards my symptoms were 5x worse. More lethargy, chills, anxiety. So I’ve decided I will not be drinking alcohol at all for the foreseeable future, I’m just too early in recovery (from kratom and other opiates) to even mess with that crap.

My ex introduced me to it, and I don’t blame her for it. It was so awesome when I first started and it was honestly a wonder drug for me, but I had no previous addictions. Well fast forward my ex and I had a child and he’s almost two now. When we first got together I was the best thing that ever happened to her and she was the best for me too. Our chemistry was unreal, but she was taking kratom and I thought nothing of it, and even asked if I could try it. Worst mistake I’ve made in my life, but she gave me fair warning though. I started slow like say 2-6 grams for the first few months, but then I got to the point I was taking 20-40 grams a day of powder. During this time we got our house and had our son, but I didn’t even realize it, but I was on a downhill slope. Half of the time when I took kratom I was sick off of it but I’d still turn around and do it the next day. I couldn’t function without it, and it made me so lazy and unmotivated. It ruined my personality. I used to be so charismatic, and full of laughter and honestly I was the life of the party in a group of people. All those traits I lost. I didn’t love on my girlfriend or help her with our little baby near as much as I should’ve. I was a recluse. I was depressed. I was anxious. I just wasn’t me anymore. Doctor put me on Valium and other things, and I was still taking all of that kratom. At that point I was a zombie between the meds and the kratom. I’ve spent thousands of dollars I couldn’t afford to spend on this addiction as well. My girlfriend was taking a lot too and for a few years longer too, but she handled her shit on it unlike me. Don’t get me wrong kratom is her demon too. Finally January 18th after a year and a half of putting up with me the love of my life, and the best damn thing to ever happen to me left me. I’ve been trying for 5 months now to put us back together, and I don’t know how that’s gonna go, but on the 18th I cold turkey quit taking the Valium and other drugs I was over medicated on. I tried quitting kratom, but I just couldn’t. Finally I’ve hit a really, REALLY dark spot and just realizing what this has taken from me as a person. Mentally I guess. I used to be so much fun, but now I’m just lame and boring, and detached. I’m tired of skipping lunch or dinner to make sure my stomach is empty so I can get more of an effect from kratom. Kratom has been the elephant in the room for me, and tomorrow I’m CT quitting kratom. I miss her, I miss seeing my son all the time. I miss my family unit. I took them both for granted. I miss myself most of all. I just hope I can be the man I was before kratom and my personality and charisma will start to return. Also it didn’t help me that during this time where I was distant from my family while sick/high off kratom I was also working 24 hour shifts on an Ambulance and I’d come home burnt out and tired and the only thing I’d think about was taking kratom. Tomorrow I work a 24, but I’ll be off for five days after that. Just wish me luck. I refuse to be this guy anymore. I’ve lost too much. Does anyone have any advice? Can my mind recover and my good personality show it’s face again?",15,0

The euphoria was a fabrication that muted the real experiences of life. My anxiety would subside, but my emotions numbed.

Havnt posted in awhile. Hope yall are doing great and are pushing threw! 

I am 10000% sober, day 56ct from green sludge. Day 27 from nicotine gum. Not 1 “urge” either. I was and am never doing this taper/ct hell again. 

My bloodwork looks good, I briefly spoke to my endocrinologist today. He said lets hold off on consult  until we complete the urine analysis kit, so we have the entire picture and go from there. Cant collect urine samples until next week. Checking my temp every morning, (BBT method) Basal Body Temp Method, my cycle start days varies slightly always has. Need to get the urine collections perfectly timed. Endocrinologist wants me on glutathione supplement and sent me a link to order. 

Ive had 2 significant bouts with “PAWS”, if yall read my previous posts day 44 and day 21/22. Day 44 being the worst, very doom and gloom. Extreme moodiness. Fatigue has been extreme then better. On and off. My short term memory and recall are awful. Cognitive functions def lacking! Some days I struggle with mental reasoning. Like hyper-sensitive some days. Even after a workout! Sneezing and rls still rolls around late nights, be it much improved though! Pins and needles rls, like a weaker version. Up and down for sure rollercoaster. Still checking my bloodpressure 7-10 a day. A few random spikes, 140/90 73pul. “Chest pain”, “anxiety” feeling is sporadic but def there. Much less now thankfully.  I get random “heart palp” type feeling in my heart. Even though 97% of my bloodpressures are excellent. 

Had a physical done in a doc’s office last week, heart sounded great, lungs, he examined my thyroid. All good. 

Def grateful to be here and focused on passing CT time and looking forward to the day my brain rebounds. I hope I dont sound negative, just trying to do a full update. Keep myself accountable. 

I recently did a deep dive into intermittent fasting for brain benefits (pubmed, Youtube for info) and have seen minimal results. Did 3 fasts recently (2 24 hr water fasts) I happy to share my tummy has again stabalized so lets hope it continues. Hope the fasts helped my gut too. Stool is normal and then not. This entire 56ct days. 

Sauna and ice baths are also back into my rotation. (Huge environmental hormesis fan! )Still training 2 leg days a week, HIIT cardio 1 leg day / circuit. 

My biggest concern today is my memory loss,cognitive function and fatigue. I stopped all supp’s back when I was @ 2 ish weeks ct. I take vit D daily though. I might have to bring some nootropics back onboard. Studying lately has been really hard. Im looking forward to my urine analysis hormone results. I know this is all normal,”par for the course” but def hasnt been easy lately. The daunting task of the up/down’s has me go back to just taking it day by day sometimes. I do often try to flip my perspective and ignore the wd process entirely and just vibe. 

Lists of things to do are my go-too’s, still taking breaks often between work, errands and household life. Saying out loud “this too shall pass” is necessary. These wd’s and “PAWS” are def sneaky. Nothing linear about it. 

Sorry for random-ish, disheveled update. Prolific writing skills went to my sister (truth) lol. 

Ps, Ive done huge deep dives into older posts here via key words on the r/quittingkratom toolbar. Why are certain posts locked? Cant comment or like? Found some really great posts, wish I couldve commented! Anyone new here, plug in key words in the group toolbar! Its def informative.",12,0

I got re-addicted to kratom after quitting 18 months ago by tapering. This last year and a half I’ve been using anywhere from 20-35 grams a day.

Days 1-3 were absolutely terrible with the acutes but since day 4 the acutes have been declining to the point where now all I have is some rls at night and that’s about it. 

However, I find myself feeling depressed, sad, and empty, and I was feeling a lot better mentally earlier on during the acute withdrawals.

I have almost no sex drive for some reason (I had a lot of it while on kratom) and I’m constantly hungry now and feel compelled to eat junk food. I’m exercising and eating healthy but I’m also eating a bunch of crap along with the healthy stuff. Also haven't slept over 5 hours in one night since I quit.

The problem is that it worked really well for allowing me to hammer out 12-14 hr days grinding, building my business. And my business grew!  


Last month we did over $100,000 in sales. Sounds great, right? Except that I've built myself a trap that will continue to suck my health if I don't stop.  


Because I was using kratom to work such long hours, my business is highly dependent on me. If I take even 2 days off work, things start to break, so the thought of taking 1-2 weeks off for WD has kept me addicted.

&#x200B;

I have been consciously sacrificing my health for the money and now I want nothing more than to have my health back, the money isn't even enjoyable when K is destroying my energy and numbing me to life.  


But I've had my rock bottom moment and quitting day is coming soon, even if the business suffers for it. It has to happen.  


Last week kratom almost killed my relationship with the woman of my dreams. After excessive burnout at work, her and I got into a petty argument that lasted 2 days and the second night I lost it on her. Screaming at her and told her she needed to leave the house for a few days.  


I instantly felt terrible for doing it and felt like I was possessed as I never act like that... ever. The thought that kratom nearly destroyed the thing I prize most in this world is just too much to tolerate. I would be so devastated to lose her.  


Lucky for me she is an amazing woman and the next morning I met up with her and confessed how sorry I was, and admitted to her the extent of my kratom addiction.  


She knew I took kratom every day, but she wasn't aware of how serious the WD's are and just how addicted I was. She has been so supportive and we are working on a plan to remove myself as much as possible from the business so I can take 2 weeks for WDs without the business crashing and burning.  


I've quit CT twice but only managed about 3 weeks both times. Came back to it because of stress from working too hard. So this time I need to consciously remove my involvement from my business and dismantle the lucrative trap I've created for myself.  


The tradeoff for my health just isn't worth it any more.",13,0

Hit a hard workout after work and did some heavy leg workouts too so hoping that’ll help with the restless legs. I’m taking ashwagandha, L-theanine, and a multi vitamin during the day, and valerian root, magnesium glycinate, vitamin c, cod liver oil, and melatonin at night. 

Wish me luck! And anyone struggling can always feel free to reach out to me, I’ll talk to you whenever I can. I’ll keep you guys updated on how it’s going. Work might suck but oh well, definitely not the first time I’ll be at work during acute withdrawal that’s for damn sure!

To all my fellow people that live a fitness lifestyle you know how rewarding it is. The endorphin and most importantly the sense of accomplishment and self worth that comes with it.

I do CrossFit 3-5 times a week and on top of that lift weights 5-6 days a week. And eat clean. This isn’t a brag because I’m bloated and really unmuscled right now. I feel like it was the kratom preventing me.

I guess I was having 3-6 drinks with kratom every day and just three days ago I decided to quit ct. I am an alcoholic and found Kava to be a great help but occasionally I would get these rashes around my eyes from drinking too much. I never thought i would use Kratom but one day I thought ""What the hell why not, good way to take a break from kava I can mix them up and alternate"". That lasted about a week before I was getting both every day. I dumbly assumed that since all the negative stuff about kava turned out to be exaggerated that the same was true of Kratom. I found the kratom helped my depression only I didn't have depression in any serious way until I started using Kratom.

My wife was always saying she didn't trust kratom so I never told her I was using it. that went on for around 4 months. She knew I had found a great community at the Kava bar and wanted to come meet some of the new friends I had made. I knew she would be upset if I ordered a Kratom drink so I planned to do a tolerance break so I could go without. Boy was I in for a surprise. I had no idea how bad it was going to be. What was going to just be a break to lower my tolerance turned into me deciding to stop using it for good. 

My last dose was sunday. going into monday was fine. Monday night was a fucking nightmare. Couldn't sleep, got the sweats and watched half of the francis ford coppala dracula (that part was actually surprisingly good. It's not scary per se but a fun time if you can get over how bad Keaunu reeve's brittish accent is). Tuesday was tough because I had work that night. Couldn't stop crying all day long and had to come clean to my wife about what was going on. Having helped me through quitting drinking and smoking she was just the best about it. Started feeling more myself and was able to work with no major problems but sleeping that night just was not in the cards. threw up almost every other hour

Woke up this morning (woke up is the wrong word, you have to be asleep to wake up but i guess I got out of bed) Naseus and dry heaving. Had trouble eating anything but was able to do some household chores and go for a walk. I was so surprised by how vibrant everything felt. Had I really been that numb to it all? Still lots of crying and feeling dumb for getting stuck on the stuff. Started feeling like myself again after finally eating some mangoes and fresh pita I baked. Felt nice to be able to accomplish something without being jacked up on 5 glasses of gold maeng da. Seems like months ago      it was one small tea in the park and then it became almost gallons of the stuff just to play with my dog or get myself to work.

Settling in for the night. No idea what it will be like. Hope for the best, expect the worst. Had two shells of kava which should help a bit. Maybe I will finish dracula. I don't know. we will see",15,0

I was taking probably 10g a day for 4 years atleast. Hard to say I can't remember much from that time. My physical symptoms have all disappeared except some stomach issues but I got on some medication and so far it's helped a TON for GERD/heartburn. As far as anxiety I have it everyday it seems but it's very mild compared to the first 2 months. Don't feel like I need to go to the ER and don't have massive panic attacks. Just mild anxiety.  I started recently taking CBD but It may be too soon to tell if it makes a difference. 

To any of who wanting to jump DO IT. Life is so much more colorful without it and even though the first few months are miserable It's NOTHING compared to what you will live through if you keep down this path. 

I have a question for those who are 3 month+ does the anxiety go away or was it something you had to work on? What issues lingered past the 3 month mark?

I have almost always taken 6g in the morning, right after waking up, and sometimes taking another 2-6g in the afternoon if I had an exam or something like that that I had to power through, with my maximum doses approaching 20g on bad days.  I've tapered down to taking 2-3g once a day in the morning, have been at this dose for a few weeks now, and I'm having trouble jumping off.  I've tried going without it in the morning and I seem to not get any physical withdrawal symptoms from this.  The problem is, it is very difficult for me to get anything done.  I don't think it's due to fatigue or brain fog - if I'm doing recreational activities (climbing, video games) I have no trouble performing as usual and feel great.  I've always used kratom as a ""productivity easy button"" and I'm so used to telling myself ""I'll just put this off until I take kratom next, since I'm infinitely more productive in that state.""  The issue is that I then only end up being productive for the first few hours of the day, or continue taking kratom throughout the day, up to the point of taking 20g+.  At this point, it's next to impossible for me to sleep, and I'll consume weed/alcohol/melatonin to get to sleep, which will make me less rested in the morning and prompting a larger morning dose of kratom.  Since I've tapered down some this isn't as much of a problem, though I seem to mentally still be in this loop.  What dose have you jumped off at?

I was gifted an unintended mystical experience roughly a month ago(those are always the ones that getcha). The content of the experience is neither here nor there but I can say with confidence that sobriety is the only way forward. Finally I feel the motivation to un-fuck up my life. 

Deep down I always knew that keeping myself clean was the only way to live a happy life. That little shit-head in my brain never shut up though, ""You sure you got this?""

This has plagued me for so long. So many quits, but I never felt any better. The anxiety, the brain fog, the lack of sleep. Why?.. Getting through the withdrawal becomes my only job. I assume contentedness will be brought to me and placed at my feet once the shit is out of my system. 

Not this time. I'm not sitting on my ass. I'm doing everything in my power to get better and it appears to be working. Exercising my balls off, staying productive no matter how tired I am, cutting the destructive friends loose(that was a tough one), reading, eating healthy, etc. etc. etc. Those little things people tell you to do get repeated for a reason. They work. But half-measures ain't gonna cut it. You can go easy early on, but don't be afraid to really push yourself.

1 month ago I CT jumped Suboxone. I used Kratom extract (a friend suggested it as that's what he used to get through wd- we've both been on subs for years) He used 2 bottles daily first month, then cut to one bottle second month and then 3 weeks at .5 bottle. I am only giving myself a month to use the Kratom because it terrifies me. I started with a little over one bottle daily and am now down to probably 3/4- half a bottle daily but could push it more than that if I really tried. I have one bottle each of the two brands that I use. I use one during the day as my preferred brand because it does not make me feel dopey or high. Even a small capful of the other brand makes me feel just a tiny bit too warm if you know what I mean so I only use that one at night but haven't even been the last few nights. I find almost no one uses the extract and everyone uses capsules or the powder but I don't know anything about that stuff. I'm just looking for advice and support tapering off in the next few days and if anyone has had experience using for such a limited amount of time. I know my body is still going through Suboxone withdrawal because that crap lasts for months but I do not want to go through Kratom withdrawal on top of it.

It has its benefits in the beginning but in time we find out the truth about it once it’s abused. This is my 2nd legitimate quit and it was harder this time mentally. For awhile I didn’t believe it would get better and have suffered mostly in silence this time. 

Kratom exacerbated a lot of my mental problems (depression and anxiety were horrible while taking it the 2nd time and getting off of it was worse). It took me weeks to get to where I am now. 

During the first 3 weeks, I was very detached from life. I was confronted with the pangs of depression and a disturbing level of anxiety that genuinely scared me for awhile. I could not think. Honestly there were times I could not complete sentences and would feel like my brain was broken. I don’t know why it was so much worse this time around, but I got to the other side once again 👍

What makes kratom so hard is the knowledge that you have to pay the piper. Everyday did get a little bit better though. The process is not linear for the first month, but you’ll continually get better days everyday until you get to the point where you’re free. 

I’m sure I will still have my moments, but I KNOW as long as I don’t go back to it, my life will be infinitely better and will continue to get better. 

I am genuinely happy again and feel like I have a healthy mind and body. I have to stress this, I am so happy now because I did it and my brain doesn’t need it! And of course, no more waking up feeling like my bones are breaking. I’m not going back this time.",14,0

Without you guys I don't think most people including myself could do it.

Before I begin I want to mention I have high functioning autism (aspergers syndrome) so any body sensations from the withdrawals always seem to linger or are way worse then I feel they should be due to generally being more sensitive to stimuli to begin with.

Long story short I got addicted to heroin at the age of 19 (26 now just had my birthday so I figured nows a good time to to myself from any dependencies) from an abusive roommate. Since then it had turned into years of use and non use from oxys to xanax to heroin. I got on kratom again because I relapsed on a pressed fent oxy back in January where the emt told me I should not have survived I woke up in the back of an ambulance after inhaling half of a pressed oxy 30. Since then I have been using kratom daily as I have in previous years. The withdrawals seem to get worse every time I quit. 

I was using about 6-10 grams a day since my overdose. I'm so happy I am still here to be here living this beautiful experience we call life. Anyways I have also been using xanax to ease my anxiety and symptoms from the withdrawals. Unfortunately I had a surplus of them and have been using them on and off for months. I have used them the last three days for the withdrawal. I know I shouldn't be using a crutch but I've been getting sleep. I am extremely depressed and disappointed with myself. It's hard to get out of bed. Should I just stop the xanax now and just suffer through it? I took my last dose Sunday at work in the morning. My body feels like lead I'm mentally exhausted. My routines have been so damaged. I don't clean my house like I used to. I come home sleep do it all over again. I ended up leaving work early yesterday which was my Friday (should have stayed, beating myself up over that). But mentally I just couldn't get through the day. The worst of the physical part seems to be starting now. 

I am just lost. I feel so hopeless and trying to remain positive but I have no energy. I'm depressed. Lonely. No one to talk to. But I'm hopeful that things will get better soon. Not generally asking any particular question here other than the xanax thing. But I would love some advice and support. Anything I should be doing? I have until sunday off of work then back at 6am for a 4 day 12 hr shift work week which I am dreading. Anything I could do this weekend since I have four days starting today to heal recover and try to get back on the path I belong. 

TL;DR : Unfortunately no way to sum that up if you don't want to take the time to read that it's okay I respect that I just need support and love and positivity. I'm falling apart. 

Thanks so much guys and gals.

I love you all and I hope to hear some positive feedback. 

Have a blessed day and stay strong. ❤

Been lurking around here for 6 months, and after 3 attempts to stop, I  finally found a good situation to do so. I soldiered through 5 days CT, from 30 gpd, 6 month routine. Valerian, Cali poppy, St. John’s, CBD, scullcap, magnesium, melatonin, blah blah blah—NOTHING put me out. 5 grueling nights, but the days seemed to be improving, until the sleep deficit finally made me feel like I was literally going to die. My body hit a wall in healing. Every night, that adrenaline freight train steam rolls through my head and wakes me up, and my knuckles, wrists and elbows descend straight into arthritic hellfire...
So, I took 4 grams kratom, about 1/8 of the amount I’d quit 5 days prior. No warm feelings, no “buzz”—it simply let me sleep about 4 hours. Next day, I knew I’d need something else strong to knock me out the next night—and NOT touch those damn receptors. Still dangerously sleep-deprived, I ended up in the ER and got a few Valium, of which I took 2, along with all the aforementioned supplements...
NOPE. Well, maybe 2.5 hours sleep, total. Yesterday I felt a bit dull, and could feel I was getting sick—my immune system was deteriorating. Tried to soldier through another night, but had to do 3 grams of kratom at 2:30am. 6 hours of sleep achieved! But I now have no idea wtf is going on, or what to do next! Any insight would be wonderful. The doc says I should have tapered, but after 5 days CT, I know I’d done most of the heavy lifting, and don’t want to keep giving it back like this.",2,1

My parole officer is retiring next week and my new PO is known to send urines to the lab even if you come up clean on the 16 panel. 

Needless to say I had to get off Kratom and fast. I used between 100 to 150 grams every day by taking an ounce usually every 4 waking hours. I stopped feeling anything from it months ago and havent enjoyed music or exercise much in the past few months either.

It might not be recommended here but I went to a doctor who put me on a 4 week suboxone taper so I can quickly and safely be off all opioids. I dont want maintenance I just need to taper with something my new po wont send me to jail for.

Anyway we started me off on 2mg at night and 2mg in the morning for the first 4 days. Last night i took 2mg and still felt a little off. I didnt get a lot of sleep and my legs were quite restless and sore. I took another 2mg before work which is where i am writing this from. My legs are better but i am extremely fatigued and keep yawning and sniffling constantly. Ive only had one bout of sneezes.

I know the amount of kratom i was taking was ridiculous but i am shocked that i still dont feel completely right after 4mg of subs. I had no idea that any amount of kratom could be that powerful and i feel even more stupid for getting myself into this situation now.

I cant wait to be of all substances for good. Kratom was just another drug to waste all my money and time on. I hope i can stay off of it for good now but i know first hand how hard it would be. I cant believe i still feel somewhat sick after 4mg of sub. Its driving me crazy.",7,0

That makes perfect sense to me. My issue is that for years now I have been dosing only once per day, one large dose in the morning. I am chasing the high from it, but not wanting to build up too much of a habit I have kept myself to only once per day. However, this does not lend itself at all to a steady dose throughout the day.

Over the last several years I have become dependent on phenibut at 5 grams per day, kratom at 30 gpd, Gabapentin rx from doctor at 2400 mgpd, and Zolpidem (ambien er 12.5 mg) rx from doctor. Multiple times over the course of these addictions my body seems to short circuit and one or more of the drugs suddenly stops working but because of the combination I'm not even sure exactly what is happening. When it happens I suddenly experience extreme insomnia, cold sweats, agitation, severe depression, racing thoughts, the typical symptoms as discussed on the quittingKratom and quittingphenibut subreddits. I am done with it all and just want my life back but it seems truly impossible. Cutting even just one gram of the phenibut out throws everything into overdrive. I recently switched strains of Kratom and that may also have exacerbated the situation. I just feel so helpless. The insomnia has cropped up from time to time over the years when this happens and it is the worst of all symptoms for me. I am lucky to get 3 hours of sleep at night if I can get to sleep at all. This will go on for a week or more before setting out. I am married with children and a stable job and am the primary breadwinner so that makes it impossible for me to do any kind of Inpatient Rehab. I am lucky in that my wife knows and I have her support, she will soon be taking over the Kratom dosing for me. I take it as capsules which I make up in a press so I will be making them and giving them to her and she will be dispensing them for me so that l can begin to taper off Kratom. My plan is to come off one at a time, Kratom first because I believe it will be easiest, then phenibut. Once those are gone, then Gabapentin is next, and last, someday, the Zolpidem.

I’m on a rapid extract taper, dropping from 4 shots/day and am now at 2/day (still a ton, I know). I’m trying to switch to capsules only by the end of June and then just jump from wherever I am July 1 so I am ready to travel late July. It’s hard bc I have two of my own businesses, and with my CFS and post-covid long-hauler symptoms the fatigue and the anxiety almost paralyze me from working without K.

Anywho, that’s still not a good enough reason to spend >$40 on any substance a day. I had a rough night last night and think I did my second shot too early at 4:30 pm. I went to bed starting to withdrawl and had a rough night til I remembered I had a big bottle of black seed oil. I took a small amount of capsules (which only like half take away the w/ds, and more the mental than physical symptoms) with black seed oil, and oh my, did it work wonders. I didn’t sleep great after, but I did feel mentally almost 100% normal. It tastes ratchet, but we’ve been consuming pond scum for years so I feel like I’d be hypocritical to complain about black seed oil’s taste.

I’ve been working out on a consistent basis, eat healthy, have made my mental health more of a priority, and overall life is just better. My relationships with both myself and others have dramatically improved and the kratom fog has completely cleared. Making it this far, I thought I’d be out of the woods. Boy was I wrong. 

I went through the horrible withdrawals like many others and came out on top, haven’t relapsed and have been relatively sober from everything else (a beer here and there plus some weed on occasion).

I hated being sober at first, it was absolutely horrendous for me. Then it got easier and easier and eventually I didn’t think about kratom much anymore, until recently. 

I am not sure what has triggered my desire to pick up kratom again. No big life changes, trauma or anything that would normally prompt me to use. Maybe I’m looking back at my use with rose colored lenses. This intense urge has been here for about a week and I just can’t get it to go away. The reptile brain is telling me “you’ve been sober for this long, you can control it this time”.

One week in.,"Was drinking kratom tea several times a day for a couple of years to help with anxiety management.  When I started tapering, each dose in tea form was about 4 grams several times a day.  Each day - over of some weeks - I cut my dose by .2 grams on average.  My last dose was about 1.2 grams one week ago.  

I’m sure this has been discussed ad nauseam here but this method worked pretty well for me.  On the first day I felt some tension in my legs but that was about it. 

It’s possible that the dose I was taking is much smaller than others and thus less severe withdrawal.  At times it probably approached 30 or so grams a day.  As of last week, on the final day, it was 3.6 grams for the entire day.

I have fairly balanced view of kratom in general.  It was fantastic for anxiety management at the doses I was taking.  So I myself see that one benefit for struggling people.  

I never felt euphoric.  There were times that it approached that feeling — but at the cost of nausea and other unpleasantness.  In that respect, it seems very self regulating.  Too much and shittiness sets in.

As for my rationale for quitting, it started to feel like a burden; a routine around which I had to schedule my day.  Frankly I got tired of managing that.

I still take SSRIs for Anxiety and Depression and I’ll have to manage that of course.

Besides those short stints it has been ~30-60gpd averaged over this entire time.

I am going to try and avoid video games and music, that was my heavy dose activities and I think I will definitely get triggered doing those. It pains me heavily to admit that.

From what I have read here, the key is to stay busy. Get lost in the activity so you can better curb the depression and hopelessness.

If you all have any activities that helped you please let me know. It would be nice to have extra things to do if I get bored of one or whatever it might be.

When I got bloodwork done two years ago everything checked out relatively fine as far as I know. I was not taking kratom or anything else at the time of the draw. I also wasn't sexually active for few months before that test. 

Fast forward to today. I've been taking kratom daily for a little over a year. it started as 3gs 3-4 times a day until January 2021. Then I upped it to 4/5gs 3-4 times a day. This helped with pain relief and mood but I virtually had no sex drive at all. There were a few chicks who I knew had mutual interest but I wasn't really turned on at all. eventually I said screw it and started seeing this one girl in late March and we'd be making out and I wasn't really getting that hard at all, so I didn't want to take it to the bedroom and have ED. (This fear stems from a failed ONS in early 2020 that I attributed it to whiskey although in hindsight, I didn't drink that much and it was probably partially attributable to Kratom)  I pretty much had to tell her that I had to make her wait a bit before we hooked up.

In that meantime of a week I researched natural things to boost libido and knew kratom was probably the cause. Bought a few herbs and was able to push through the low drive for a month (April) or so, but could still only go once a day max.  After that month , the herbs weren't as effective and I felt my drive was still low. Since the beginning of May its been up and down, mostly down.  I quit alcohol around that same time, that didn't do much. I had also lowered my kratom dosage to 3gs 3 times a day and that helped for a few days, but low drive and ed would still happen about half the time. Considering I was now in a relationship with this girl, I figured Kratom had to be cut out completely but I wanted to get bloodwork and compare it to the reference I had from two years prior, when I wasn't on Kratom. The results are below. 

In July 2019, at 21yo \~ 8am draw : in parenthesis are the reference ranges at each time

Test was 907ng/dl (249-836)   
Free T was 127 pg/ml (47-244)  
SHBG was 56 nmol/L (11-80)  
LH was 7.32mlu/ml (1.24-8.62)  
Prolactin was 6.30ng/ml (2.63-13.13)

In June 3 2021 at 23 \~11am draw :

Test was 1,038 ng/dl (264-916)  
Free T serum was 21.1 pg/ml (9.3-26.5) (Don't understand the discrepancy here)  
SHBG was 42.8nmol/L (16.5-55.9)  
LH was 16.5 mlu/ml (1.7-8.6)  
Prolactin was 58.9 ng/ml !!! (4-15.2)

So pretty much my LH was very high and my prolactin was through the roof. Note I didn't orgasm for about 72 hours before the test. My Testosterone and everything else was very high and I'm in really good shape so I figure prolactin is the cause of low libido and the kratom is what's causing that to be so high. 

I decided to quit CT on the 7th and my libido has came back a little but still seems low. Its been 8 days and I've heard it comes back almost immediately. Does anyone have any experience with how long it will take for it to come back for good? Or any other advice? I'm a young dude and haven't had this issue while not on Kratom.  Thanks for any suggestions and hope this can help anyone with a similar issue.",2,0

I experienced both today. 

This morning I woke up in withdrawal with no energy. I almost let it talk me out of yoga but I reasoned that if I force myself to do it,  I'll feel a positive boost 

And I did,  but I had no joy during the yoga. Just had to force myself slowly through it,  line forcing yourself to eat when your appetite is screwed up. 

But I felt a boost after. 

Later in the morning at work,  I felt the other form of energy creep up and I had to get up from my chair and work,  moving my body a little. Then I thought ""why don't I take this nervous restless disordered energy and put it to work in a positive way?""

So I decided to take a 30 minute walk. And I walked vigorously and aggressively. I didn't have to force the walk like with yoga. 

And you know what? Walking vigorously stated to transform that uncomfortable scattered energy into something more positive and comfortable. 

Work with the energy you have. Don't let the 'no energy"" feeling convince you you can't get up and get your blood flowing. You might have to force it,  but if you do that realize there was at least some energy despite the no energy feeling. 

Third week of tapering continues to go well. Had a rough day yesterday but stuck with the schedule and did not need the second evening dose.

Trying to have a baby and it's impossible on kratom.,"I was here a while ago and successfully was able to get off of kratom for a few months. It was honestly awful. I think I *maybe* got one good nights sleep every month or so the entire time.

Welp, things started to get better and I had a vacation and thought to myself, why not take a little bit? Had half a teaspoon and felt great.

But then of course, half a teaspoon let to a teaspoon, led to whatever it is I'm at now. I have an addictive personality and I'm an idiot for starting back up again.

My wife and I are trying to have another kid and I have to tell you, it's impossible for me. It's so incredibly difficult for me to get hard, and when I do I feel it going away almost immediately. 

What sucks is I'm the sole proprietor of my family. I can't go through PAWS while working, especially now that I've got a new boss. I've got access to a lot of gaba for my anxiety so I'm going to give that a shot but it doesn't seem to work quite as quickly as kratom does.

I don't want to go through the akathisia again, the sleepless nights. I tried what someone had recommended and started taking gaba every 30-minutes or so for 4-hours before my bedtime but it didn't really seem to work. I haven't been able to find another solution though to it, because if I could it'd be so much easier than going to the spare bedroom as moaning is the only way to relieve it and I don't want to disturb my wife or kid.

The other absolutely awful part of PAWS is the mouth watering. It's disgusting and I can't even begin to describe what it feels like.

I also have Naltrexone from when I was quitting drinking and the first time I took *maybe* an 1/8th of the pill and it was an absolutely awful experience, but it only lasted a few hours and made quitting a lot easier. And honestly, I'll take the cold/hot flashes, the weak legs and arms over the akathisia any day of the week.

If anyone has any recommendations for getting through the akathisia I'm all ears, but more wanted to rant as I'm really angry that I allowed myself to get back to this spot.",6,0

So about 6ish weeks ago, I posted about starting a taper. It was up and down to begin with, but just measuring initially already seemed to make my body upset with what I assume were some w/d. 

I adjusted and adjusted (or maintained as best I could) until I didn’t feel that off feeling anymore. I kept trying to spread my doses out but I struggled. So I finically decided, alright... I’m limiting myself to 6 doses a day, at a minimum of 2 hours apart, however the ideal is 3-4 hours. With that decision, I got a little more successful. Spent a week at 5g doses, so 30gpd.

I added Agmatine, 750mg with my first and last doses of the day. The Agmatine helped when I did phenibut (or I think it did, so I thought I’d try it with Kratom. It’s been a few months since the last time I utilized Agmatine. So far I’m unsure if it’s actually helping or not but I’ll keep with it).

Today, I made the first dose drop after stabilizing... taking 0.25g off each dose. I know that’s going to make this a lot slower than my original plan of maybe 0.5g per dose but... I did a very slow taper with Phenibut and was successful (been off that stuff for months now!).

I’m going to try to do 5 days at this dose before dropping, but will allow for a week if I need to. Depends on my own body. I know it’s slow... but that’s what I’m capable of right now.

Days 1-3 were pretty awful, I felt nothing but dysphoria and spent a lot of time crying and just generally feeling bad. The RLS was awful and kept me up for most of the 2 night. Luckily I had a week off work and with the knowledge that it wasn’t how I was truly feeling but just a withdrawal I was able to get through it ok. I spent both days walking ALOT, this took my mind off how I was feeling. If I stayed inside I would start to feel claustrophobic and would just dwell on negative thoughts and emotions.

Days 4&5 I saw a marked improvement in my overall mood. I had a couple of waves of natural energy/motivation which I haven’t felt in a long time. I still can’t sleep for shit but atleast the RLS has greatly diminished so I can atleast just relax. 

 Still a long way to go but it’s reassuring to know that I am seeing improvements already. Tonight I will make my first trip back in the gym as I stopped going when I was on K and it used to help me a lot with my mood & energy. 

Walking and being outside had helped me enormously. Days 1&2 I spent around 8 hours just walking around & sitting in parks which helped me be in the present moment rather than sitting inside staring at a screen or a wall inside 4 walls.l

So lets get this out...

I have been using kratom now for well over 3 years, every single day, never missing a dose. I don't run out. I order several kilos at a time. I know the best plugs in the game and get the best quality leaf that's out there. But this doesn't seem to matter anymore and my life over the last 3 years has went to complete shit. 

Originally I was addicted to opiates/opioids and just to throw out a ballpark estimate i was using something like 100mg oxycodone per day, sometimes more and less on bad days. So some shit went down and I got caught up in a marijuana cultivation raid and went to jail for a couple of weeks. It was absolutely horrifying! Not really the fact that I went to jail (was not my first rodeo), but going in having full-blown withdrawal. God damn was I miserable... So a couple of weeks passed by and I finally bonded out. Upon my release, I was experiencing all the works, you know (anhedonia, RLS, aches and pains, cravings, depression, anxiety, you name it..) The physical symptoms don't alleviate all too much for me because I have chronic Lyme disease and it causes me a ton of pain. I also tested with an extremely high rheumatoid factor and possible positive for lupus on top of it. The only thing that manages my pain as well as kratom is cannabis (which I'm going to incorporate into my recovery).

So... I get out of jail and had some leaf stored back that I used when I ran out of pills or was broke and could not afford them. Took a couple tsp and oh boy, I felt amazing! Especially for the length of time that the opioids had been absent from my system. I didn't ever remember kratom feeling quiet that well before and I know the reason. Let's fast forward to today and I'm using around 10 to 12 grams every 3 hours and sometimes dosing a couple of tsp in between doses! So yes, I am a heavy user and I'm so fed up with where it has taken me. I started making a list of things to do and to catch up on and when I got two pages in, I realized that my life has went down the shitter. I'm so in debt and not because of the kratom but because I'm so lazy now... I'm probably the laziest sob in my entire county. Thats says a lot. I can't walk through my bathroom to sit down on my shitter even for all the trash piled up everywhere, dishes overflowing, mixing cups (i mix my leaf in OJ in cheap disposable cups) laying all over the counter and floors. Its insane! Its like walking down skid row and syringes laying everywhere only cups instead.

  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I have neglected my kids and my wife. I have a great self employment business and I've let it go to hell. I'm depressed, suicidal most days and literally full of anhedonia at this point. Constantly sweating... its getting to the point i want to dose every 2 hours instead of every 3, where it used to be every 4. Kratom is in control of my life, literally. I have no control whatsoever at this point.  I'm scared to quit CT... I'm scared to taper yet at the same time I am dying inside to do one or the other. I feel like I'm losing self control (detached and depersonalization). My hair is falling out, my hygiene is terrible, etc etc...

I need support. I know this is long as hell and I apologize for that, but I feel like I just can't say enough... I also feel like I am constantly in WD. 

The ONLY thing that keeps me sane is going to the gym. I am a dedicated body builder so I lift most days of the week and it helps me feel so much better. But its getting to the point that I sit in the gym parking lot and dose my leaf and wait for the effects to kick in, once I feel a little something I just sit and get all fucking lazy and by time I start i feel like dosing again. Also, we all know how much bodybuilders have to eat to get big, well kratom is the only thing keeping me from meeting my size goals... I keep myself from eating because it literally KILLS the effects of kratom. Makes it simply not work for me and its just this cancerous circle repeating itself. I am consuming my own tail going in circles. 

Again, so sorry for the long ass post. Whatever I choose to do, I do plan on using cannabis in the recovery process... I have deep ties with cannabis and I believe immensely in its healing abilities and all around beneficial effects. 

Okay, I have to stop here or no one is going to read all of this... lol.",65,0

I’m glad I did as I probably would have taken more. Tomorrow  starts day 1 again after 48 days clean. I am not going to beat myself up about this but rather just move on.

I used kratom to get off of fentanyl, but I’ve got about 3 years of experience with kratom (using, quitting, relapsing). I realized after the absolute hell I’ve been through from getting off of fent, I’m going to be easy on myself and taper off of kratom. As of now I’m taking 3grams 3x per day, I’ll slowly lower that over the next 30 days then just jump off. 

Kratom doesn’t hold a candle to withdrawals from harder opioids, but it always has a crappy mental depression/anxiety thing that hangs around for a while. I will stay committed to this taper and hope to be completely off the stuff in a month or less. I ordered some black seed oil, DLPA, L-tryptophan, valerian root, and magnesium glycinate to help aid in my recovery. Thanks guys!",7,0

470,2021-06-14 17:01:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nzwx7e/acceptance_during_sobriety/,Acceptance during sobriety,"This post is long (sorry!), but thought it would be a good idea to quantify my thoughts and emotions to save for future reading (myself and anyone else who reads this). Sometimes just writing everything out is cathartic in its own right. 

**TLDR: ** Have been using substances to numb myself and prevent emotional growth and acceptance for 5 years. Quitting Kratom after moderate/heavy use (20-30 GPD for a year at least) was physically uncomfortable, but more so emotionally defeating. Keep this in mind during your own quitting process; the mental battle is almost always the reason for a relapse. It sure does suck, but I’m pushing on and so are you.

My mother passed away on July 7th, 2019 after a long and arduous bout of cancer. As it spread throughout her body, the pain she experienced (even with helper medicine) was unimaginable. I was working during the day while I was back in my hometown on summer break. After a tough day at work, I’d go home to see nothing but pain and sadness. A constant reminder that all the chemo and radiation in the world can only prolong inevitability. In the end, I had to carry her frail body into an ambulance to take her into a hospice facility. I remember wondering when the last time she carried me, maybe 7 or 8 years old? It all ended with me carrying her instead. During her multi year long illness (she was diagnosed with cancer in 2015), I was leaning on THC initially and eventually transitioned to Kratom so I could still pass common drug tests. 

Similar to most of you all, my Kratom use skyrocketed after some time. For me the catalyst was my mother passing and me beginning a new job in a fast paced environment. I have no idea how many GPD I was doing for the first 1.5 years of use. I’d estimate the peak using to be about 25 GPD, but I can’t be sure (I’d literally take a normal spoon and just scoop away until I could cope with existence) 

As of today I’m about 5 days sober from all substances except caffeine. I have not been sober or in tune with my own mind for nearly 6 years at this point. I’ve cycled through THC, alcohol, Kratom, and nicotine for years. It’s kind of fucking crazy waking up this morning and just existing as a person.

I’m not hear to preach happiness and sunshine though. Withdrawing from Kratom was pretty tough, and I’m at the point where I’m physically normal, but the mental battles are painful. For 6 years I’ve cushioned the mental impact of cancer on my family. I used substances (especially kratom) as a barrier to my feelings and emotions. For 6 long years I have not interpreted my own thoughts and mental struggles without chemical aid in some shape or form. 

I’ve cried (I’m talking sobbing here) 3 times just today. Every image, memory, and emotion that I have of my mom came back to me today. But for every bad memory there are 100 good ones. Even the good memories bring on the tears; it’s nostalgic and deeply saddening in its own right. I took a 45 minute break (I WFH) and just ran until I could barely stand up. It’s important to find appropriate channels to put time and effort into. 

It’s okay to cry. I’ve never felt more defeated and depressed than I have today. But it’s not okay to perpetually delay acceptance and emotional interpretation through the use of Kratom or any other substance. I’m positive that my mom wouldn’t approve of my past substance use, and now I’m taking steps to craft a better, more in tune image of myself. 

For those reading this far; I challenge you to make your own post. I learned a great deal about my own struggles and thought process in the 20 minutes it took to write this. Stay strong, and embrace the suck.",6,0

They tested my testosterone levels and it came back as extremely low. Prolactin and all other levels came back in the normal range which was kinda weird. Based on the symptoms of having low testosterone, a lot of it sounded like how I felt prior to kratom, anxiety and depression being the major reasons why I got hooked. 

I told my doctor about my kratom use and that it was known to lower testosterone levels after years of use, however she felt that based on my test results that it didn't have anything to do with kratom and that I should start on TRT and monitor my levels. I thought if I had naturally low testosterone that it might explain why I have struggled so hard to quit on prior attempts (months of paws). 

Is there anyone out there that has been in a similar situation, and has getting on TRT actually helped in your attempt to quit? Are their other tests that the doctor can run to confirm whether or not my suppressed testosterone levels are kratom related? Once I get on TRT is there any way to get off of it in the event it appears my test levels are naturally going to recover? 

So many questions but I fear the worst is that I will just have to quit again, wait a couple months and get my levels tested. Looking for some insight or if anyone has any words of wisdom.

I had a pocket of pre-made oblate packets in my pocket and a plan. I’d take one every 4 hours and begin a taper. Before we headed out I tossed and washed a teaspoon and made the drive. About an hour into it, I wanted more. When we got there, even though it was less than 3 hours later, I took one of the pouches. 

All through the rest of that day I’d take a dose, feel “ok” and about an hour or an hour and a half I’d feel terrible. I wrote my first post on this sub titled, I don’t think I can do this. I got home that night took some more and said I’d taper later. 

I woke up the next morning, took half a teaspoon and said, enough. In a move of either sheer bravery or stupidity, I dumped every bit of K I had in the house, poured it in the trash so I couldn’t just get the bags out later. I felt instant relief, and instant fear. 

The first few days were pretty bad. I visited this sub, tried to post and comment when I could, enjoying the anonymity of it. I didn’t sleep for a few days, I ached and, at times, didn’t know if I’d make it.

I haven’t been able to get to fewer than 3 shots per day, but today I decided to suck it up. The nausea, the money, the secrecy…not worth 15 minutes of euphoria. I decided  I’ll do one shot in the morning for a week, then try to suck it up with gabapentin and potentially psych meds the rest of the day. Next week, it’s only capsules (not extract ones) and the week after that I’m making the jump and going cold turkey (not legit cold turkey, obvs).

I’m nervous as hell, but excited too. I mostly just cannot WAIT to be down to single digits. For some reason that’s the official “you’re doing something right” metric, in my weird and kratom-addled mind.

Even though I’ve been on 16 G for 4 days, I was still feeling it pretty significantly yesterday. It was 81 degrees here and I went for a long walk. In the sun, I was fine. Albeit a tad extra sweaty. But the SECOND I walked under a shadow, it was suddenly like I was in the epicenter of the Arctic, being blasted by katabatic winds. I’d instantly start shivering and have to do this awkward little speed walk to get back into the sun again. I had goosebumps the entire time. And I was legit getting ANGRY at the foliage. Like, “why would someone plant SO MANY trees here?!” But hey, at least I finished!

I’ve also been having major GI upset. I’ve taken nothing for it because, oddly, I sort of revel in the feeling that I’m expelling all the nasty kratom toxins I’ve taken in over the last year. 

Last of all, sleep is touchy. I wake up at 300 AM every morning and there’s no chance of going back to bed. So I browse this sub and read all your stories and they empower me to stick with this. I especially love the taper stories because this is my first ever taper. 

I’ve always been the girl who just runs out of K (or money) and is forced into CT. This time is different. I literally just started HATING Kratom until it got so bad that devising a plan to quit was my only option. I derive no pleasure from my doses anymore. It’s simply a means to an end.

Over the last 6.5 years, other than the first 6-9 months, the lowest daily dose I've been at was just north of 20 GPD and the highest around 40-45 GPD. By the summer of 2016 I had already been using for a year and a half. I had a long international trip planned that summer and did not take any Kratom with me. Just before departing for my trip I was at roughly 15 GPD. I experienced no withdrawals (unless I did have withdrawals and attributed it to jet lag). If I did in fact have withdrawals, it was nothing significant nor more than a day or two. Two years later, I took another international trip and went CT once again. This time I was at roughly 30 GPD. Unlike the last CT experience, the withdrawals were unbearable for a week. I didn't sleep more than 30 minutes for the first 4 nights while tossing and turning all night. During the day, I had RLS nonstop. I didn't have energy to shave, shower, brush my teeth, or do other basic daily tasks. The mental fog, anxiety, and depression were even worse than the physical symptoms. These acute withdrawal symptoms subsided after a week, but I had PAWS for a month. Regrettably, I started using again before the PAWS symptoms disappeared. It was at this time that I recognized the hole I had dug myself.

Now it's 3 years later, and I'm 6 weeks into a slow taper from 30-35 GPD to 17.5 GPD. The 30-35 GPD prior to the start of my taper were split into 3 doses with the smallest dose in the morning, bigger dose around lunch, and the largest dose in the evening. At the beginning of my taper, I dropped my mid-day dose completely. This took about 5 days to adjust to, but the withdrawal symptoms weren't too bad. Going from there, I've been dropping 0.5 g every 4-5 days, and I already feel more like my old self.

&#x200B;

I'm hoping to make the jump sometime in September when I'm at less than 7 GPD. Does anyone have any suggestions on what I can do to make this process easier? Would it be better to wait until I'm down to less than 3-4 GPD to make the jump? I'd like to avoid PAWS, but I'm more scared of jumping too early and relapsing.

&#x200B;

Also, am I less likely to experience PAWS after I make the jump than if I had gone CT without a taper?

&#x200B;

Coming from someone that has gone CT with devastatingly bad withdrawal symptoms, I'd recommend trying a taper. Obviously I haven't successfully completed it yet, but I've cut my consumption by more than half relatively painlessly, so I feel it's worth sharing what I have learned.

&#x200B;

Tips for a taper:

1. Use pills rather than powder for dosing consistency.
2. Do not alternate between vendors. Use the same vendor throughout the taper. If you jump from vendor to vendor, you ruin the benefits of the taper. Potency will vary depending on your source, so just stick to one.
3. Take your doses around the same time every day.
4. Don't make any dosing drops that you aren't confident you can handle. The 0.5 gram drops I've made every 4-5 days have been painless.
5. Make a plan with dates, dosages, and tapering milestones. An Excel spreadsheet works best for me.
6. Believe in the better and happier you that will come out on the other side. I find that I have to constantly remind myself that this is all worth it. I won't need Kratom to be happy or productive.",5,0

It's taken a while, but after lurking on this sub and scouring through posts for the past couple of days, I've finally decided I've had enough. I've been using kratom consistently for the past 3 years or so while also still going on an oxy binge occasionally. Like many others, I used it as a withdrawal tool to get off harder stuff at the time and fell into the trap of thinking that kratom itself is perfectly fine as a substitute. 

It's really pathetic what this addiction has done to me. It's completely crushed my motivation and made me apathetic and lazy to the point of detriment. My house stinks, I lost my license for an incredibly stupid reason (didn't notify the DMV of an insurance change) and have been too lazy to attempt to get it back, and I constantly look down at my phone to time when I can take my next dose and get the best effects. The only great thing I have going is my job that pays very well and I have a wonderful reputation and report with everyone, but I know if I keep this up I'll lose that too. This is such as a garbage way to live my life and I've come to the realization that I need to really correct this now at my age (31) so I can live what's supposed to be the prime of my life free of this nonsense.

So, after doing some soul searching, I plan on taking my last dose Thursday, 6/17, at 5:00pm. I've already lowered my dose down to 9 gpd despite having finished an oxy bender last Wednesday around the same time. I feel surprisingly ok lowering the dose down so much (3x 3g) so quickly and plan to stabilize on it until Thursday comes. I went back and forth on tapering vs. CT, and decided I just really want to get this over with. A big factor in this decision also has to do with coming off of a major Opana habit (20-40 mg insufflated a day) CT. Not only did I pull it off, but also had to work through it one day in a stressful situation (meeting with SVP), traveled hundreds of miles lugging around 50 pounds of luggage at the airport, and spent days hiking/driving through a freezing area with snow literally stacked 12+ feet high for hours. If I can pull that off, I can do this. I'm just ready to get this over with and keep thinking about how great my life was before I ever got involved in any of this mess.

Will it be hard? I'm sure it will be. I've dealt with some brutal withdrawals before and I expect this one to be no different and possibly harder in some ways. I know it's going to be especially hard mentally given how much I've used it as a crutch to justify it's continued use for such a long time. But I'm just ready to close the chapter on this part of my life and move on. It's going to be a long, drawn out war and I'll have to learn to accept the battles I win everyday (even now by slipping down to 9 gpd).

Finally, for you folks who have actually managed to kick this, major congrats to you. Your posts were a contributing factor in me going through with this and pushing forward. Thank you for sharing your commitment, struggles, and victories. It helps more than you can imagine especially with lurkers like myself.",11,0

I used kratom for 10 days to aid me in getting off of an addiction that is way more damaging (fentanyl).

I’ve probably quit kratom 8 or 9 times but I’m ready for it to stick this time, which is why I am posting for accountability. I’m grateful to be off of harder opiates but now it’s time to tackle the kratom before I’m in it deep. Thanks guys, this forum has been awesome over the past couple years.

Taper lasted 15 days, and the withdrawal symptoms were annoying and drawn out during the taper, but haven’t been bad since. With the taper I was able to sleep every night which I wasn’t able to ever do with previous CT experiences. 

Most of the discomfort has been psychological, just feeling very flat and disengaged with what’s going on around me. RLS only at night. My partner has been so supportive during this entire process, which I’m so grateful for. I bought some Kratom drug tests for added accountability to take weekly, and was negative for the first time yesterday which is kinda cool.

Anyway, I’m not exactly sure why I’m posting this. I guess just to give hope to those who are going through it and say that it probably won’t be as miserable as expected. This shit isn’t easy, but a life free from addiction is all I can hope to have.

This is my 2nd time giving up kratom. The first time I went CT from about 40gpd. That was absolute hell, but I got through it. Was off it for a few months but ended up taking it again.

Last day on 16 GPD down from 26 GPD.,"The mornings are my worst time. Even before Kratom, I always woke directly into a state of primal fear. I’m sure it has something to do with AM Cortisol levels being elevated as a result of some ancient Darwinian mechanism. 

This anxiety subsides once I take my morning dose, and that scares me. What’ll I replace that with when I get down to zero? I suppose the point of a taper is to slowly figure that out. But if anyone has any ideas, I’m all ears.

So far I’ve been mildly uncomfortable at 16 GPD. But I’ve been walking 3 miles every day, getting out in the sunshine, and running at least 1.5 miles. I pray I can continue this routine tomorrow, when I drop to 12 GPD. 

Some may say I’m dropping too fast. But I need this to be over soon. I’m ingesting literal poison every day and it’s killing me to recognize that. 

How do I know it’s poison? I’ve never shared this before, but I went to the ER a few months back for altered mental status. I’m bipolar and my lithium levels got too high. But before they figured that out, they ran a tox screen on me. I TESTED POSITIVE FOR FENTANYL. 

I’ve never touched fentanyl in my life, and the only thing I was taking at the time was Kratom. I was SO embarrassed, and that stain is forever on my medical record, even though I tried to explain that I thought it was the kratom throwing a false positive.

Anyways, Fentanyl analogs are floating around all of our bloodstreams right now. And that scares the shit out of me. Just one more reason to get off this garbage.

I am excited to say that I have successfully passed the 2-month mark kratom-free! I can't even express how awesome it is to finally not have this nagging addiction anymore. I truly feel amazing! 

It honestly was easier than I expected; however, it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows. Determination and purpose really makes a difference though. Have there been times I missed kratom? Absolutely. However, they are brief and pass quickly, and those ""cravings"" (which really is a bit strong of a word to describe it) happen less and less often. 

One of the things I am really enjoying (that I didn't even expect) is that I don't base the entire day of activities around when I'm taking my next dose. I used to think, ""I'll wait another 2 hours until my dose to go for a run or bike ride."" That sucked. I am actually MORE productive now than I was over the last several years!

I am exploring new hobbies and activities and enjoying so much more of the simple-life things that I didn't before. I find so much more fulfillment in life now that my priorities have totally shifted. I didn't expect any of this. Life is better on this side. I spend more time with my family now. Life has slowed down, and I enjoy colors and sounds and textures more. I even feel like I have more emotion (which is something that also happened when I came off my previous opiate addition and coming off antidepressants).

I also want to mention that my kratom habit was a ""dirty"" secret. I was a liar and sneaky. I absolutely hated that. I always carried the worry of being ""found out."" It feels good to be a better person now.

Everyone who is on the quitting journey, please, I beg you, don't give up. One of the BEST things you can do is STAY BUSY and quit with PURPOSE. It does get better, and you can do it. And always remember, if you stick it out today, tomorrow, and the next day, one day at a time, in only a month or two, you will be in a totally different world. It will only get better from there. In 6 months to a year, you will rarely think about kratom. I know this from quitting opiates in the past. It will be okay. Better yet, it will be awesome!

I need to quit but I can't handle my life sober. I have absolutely nothing going on in my life and havent for years and without kratom the boredom and depression is unmanageable. Its unmanageable on kratom too and so idk what to do. If I wasn't using I'd probably go back to getting blackout drunk everyday and I'm pretty sure that's even worse.

I was addicted to kratom for 5-6 years. As of last week, I was up to 9.8g doses 3x a day. 30 fucking grams a day. Insane. I was also using phenibut for 2 years at 9.4g a day and xanax nightly at 1mg-2ng for the past two months. 

Needless to say, I was at my limit. I constantly felt like shit and didn't know how to stop. Tapering didn't work and there was no way I was going to cold turkey everything. I looked into IOP detox programs but was turned away because my situation was ""too complex"". Eventually, an IOP program referred me to inpatient detox and I pulled the trigger. 

I've never been in treatment before so I was incredibly scared of what would happen. In preparation, I printed out a few case studies, packed my bags, and checked myself into detox last Saturday. I just got out a few hours ago and I feel amazing. 

Bringing case studies/literature to your evaluation is essential. Most detoxes are probably familiar with kratom by now and know how to treat it but phenibut is a little more complicated. NO ONE I talked to knew what it was. That's where the case studies came into play. I briefly explained phenibut and how it works. Thankfully, the doctor was incredibly open-minded and wrote me a prescription for baclofen based on the literature I brought. Most importantly, he started me on a Subutex/Ativan taper. 

Overall, my withdrawal symptoms were incredibly mild and manageable. I had some issues with muscle tension and RLS but other than that it was a breeze. I would 100% recommend inpatient detox to anyone who feels trapped. Not everyone has the willpower to taper or quit cold turkey. 

I'm 7 days clean from kratom, phenibut, and xanax. Wishing everyone the best.",31,0

I quit Kratom CT 3 weeks ago and I'm feeling unmotivated about everything. My past usage:

3-5 GPD long-term  
10GPD for the past 2 months

I'm wondering if the anhedonia is from PAWS or whether this is just my normal self.

It seems like most people in this community quit at around 30GPD and felt better after 30 days.

At a peak of 10GPD, how long should I expect to feel anhedonia for? Are 3 weeks too short to find out if I'm feeling depressed in general or if it's just the kratom? (maybe this is what people mean when they say that fighting PAWS is a mental battle)

I'd appreciate if anyone with a similar habit as mine could let me know how long their process of quitting took.

Thank you",2,0

Taking the bunk kratom and not realizing it wasn't really working seemed to have helped the withdrawl process, not only was it an excuse to ""might as well quit"" from the opportunity it provided, but those 2-3 days of ignorance helped me not pay as much attention to the anxiety surrounded by diving into the hell that is withdrawl. It was sort of like ""well im this far in I guess might as well stick to it"".

This is my 2nd legitimate quit off of Kratom (my first time was 07/10/2020 and it lasted for 4 months). 

If you read some of my posts, I was suffering really bad for the first 15 days I’d say. Physical symptoms were nasty even at a dose of 1g a day for 2 months. It’s really hard to believe that, but it’s most likely due to rekindling. Kratom is bizarre in that it’s physically a nightmare when I stop no matter how low the dose. Definitely not as bad as when I was up to 30-40gpd, but it doesn’t matter. It still sucks. 

Psychologically, it was worse this time around. My anxiety/depression was horrible. I attribute that to not having a suboxone taper so I felt everything. I think it was also because I failed myself by going back to it and it bothered me a lot more. The depersonalization, derealization coupled with mini panic attacks, lack of concentration, and extreme anxiety (especially at days 8-11) was scary. I had to remind myself it was the withdrawal and not my mind that was causing this. I would walk around my neighborhood and feel like an alien around people. That’s not me. Again, at such a low dose, I was shocked this was happening to me. 

Anyway, I’m at day 27 and I’m pretty much back to normal thank god! I can again wake up without the back pain bullshit, tiredness, hair falling out bullshit. I think about it like you’re in space and checking how much oxygen is left in the tank. Kratom in this case becomes your new oxygen and you have to fixate on the schedule or suffer the withdraw the withdrawal consequences. It’s poison to the soul. 

This time around I’m repulsed by kratom. It’s a blessing in a way that I suffered like I did because it’s burnt in my head that any amount of K will result in an even worse withdraw if I touch it again. 

I had a grandiose attitude during the first quit and was too confident. You have to consistently put the addict mind in it’s place. You have to replace bad habits with good ones. I’m not perfect and I still drink in excess on the weekends at times, but one thing at a time! 

That’s a huge thing to consider!! In life, you can’t fix everything at once. That will result in immediate failure because your brain will be overwhelmed. If you are currently addicted to kratom and want to figure out how to stop, focus your complete attention on that first. I promise you (if you are like me) that this addiction probably bothers you to no end. You know it’s holding you back from getting to the next stage of your life. It’s like being in purgatory. You know it won’t kill you, but it’s also stopping you from living.

I’m beyond shamed to say I’ve posted here before, about a year ago. I quit CT then and it stuck for about 3 months.

Most of You can guess the rest. I thought, just for one day, that I could dose. I began walking to the headshop near my house. And here’s the fucked up part, you guys. I TURNED AROUND. I started walking the other way because I knew… I KNEW, if I took a dose I’d be right back where I started. 

But after a couple blocks I changed my mind again. I DID go to that headshop. And I got addicted again.

So here I am. I am a 35 yr-old female, unmarried, no kids. I am a long distance runner. A Kickboxer (Muay Thai). I am bipolar type I. I’ve beaten alcohol and pill addiction and am absolutely sober for 6 years. Except for Kratom.

And I feel like a fraud to the sober community. 

It’s now a little over a year since I’ve been using again. A couple weeks ago I started counting the amount I’ve been taking. I was averaging 26-30 GPD, in the form of capsules.

I’ve decided to try a taper this time around, and immediately dropped to 18 GPD as a starting dose. Relatively easy. Now I’m on 16 GPD… and it’s getting tougher. Not like, I’m gonna give up, tough. But my body temperature is all over the place. Hell it was 67 degrees here yesterday and I spent the WHOLE DAY under the down comforter, while lying on top of a heating pad put on “max heat”.

I should be proud that I’m down 10 grams from my starting dose in just the span of a week. But to be honest, all I feel is disgust. I’m so angry with myself. So sick of having this festering boil of a secret, which feels like it could pop at any minute. 

If it were any of you, I’d be preaching self compassion. I’d be telling you to give yourself a break. But I just can’t find it in me to be that for myself. I hate who I’ve become. The pallored skin, the thinning hair, the secret packages, and the sheer panic when one doesn’t arrive.

I hope to God this time sticks. I can’t imagine myself doing this for another year, 5 years, 10 years. I need it to be over for good.

542,2021-06-12 09:12:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ny6g1x/2_years_sober/,2 years sober,"Hello all! Yesterday was the 2 year mark for me since going Kratom free. 

Year one was challenging, in regards to the psychological effects of PAWS. Seemed to hit me hard every 2-3 months at all the wrong times, lasting 2-5 days of a weird sadness that I couldn’t shake and couldn’t explain why. But after each time I became more aware of what was going on in my mind and each occurrence took less time to get over. I was able to use my mostly clear mind to find the girl of my dreams and develop a relationship I’ve never truly had in my life before. 

This past year was a little different. Months 12-18 I had some occasional mild PAWS events, but nothing crazy. What was truly different about this year was the little nagging that my mind would do trying to convince me to use again. In my state Kratom has started to take off in head shops all around the area, city to city. Some weren’t shy about it and advertised Kratom on billboards and windows, some shops are even dedicated to Kratom…which disturbed me. There were a few times I found myself at head shops shopping for some vape gear for my nicotine and my errr…illicit plant use (some vices take longer than others to kick lol) and looking at their Kratom selection. From straight powder to capsules. I’m happy to report that I resisted the urge every time.

I have used this year to be in a place that I never thought I’d be looking back two years ago. I’m now a homeowner in a nice area, did a top to bottom makeover of the place that I’m extremely proud of only calling in experts to install the flooring. I’ve got a baby girl on the way with my lovely lady who I plan to pop the question to in a month (don’t worry it’s not a shotgun wedding, I’ve had this date picked out since our first date ☺️). And while I’m a little strapped for cash now getting the house fixed up and preparing for our little menace to come this August, I have a well paying job that I am confident will make the ends meet. 

Just wanted to pop in and share my progress with all of you and offer my support to all of you taking on this challenge. It’s funny because for the longest time I was ashamed of my addiction when I was in the thick of it while also being in denial thinking that Kratom was helping my deal with some trauma that I had bottled up, when in reality it was degrading every part of my life socially and mentally. But now I look at my addiction with a sense of pride. The key for me was to recognize that the addiction will always be apart of you, and you can never let your guard down thinking you’ve truly overcome it. It’s always a struggle. Some days are harder than others. But days turn to months, and months turn to years. And overall it does get easier. Life gets better. But my advice is to never forget you’re an addict, because that is when you let your guard down and allow yourself to slip up. 

The first time I quit, I went months without it. I kept my stash with the thought that if I can resist the temptation with it readily available, it proved I was in control. And it led to me think I could handle taking it every now and again and soon after that I was in deeper than I was the first time. 

Anyways, I wish you all well on your journeys. I hope that your road to recovery offers a path to a better life and happiness like mine has. And I hope to be sharing another year Kratom free with you all next year. Stay strong, you can do this. It gets easier, it gets better. ✌🏼❤️",33,0

I've been tapering with relative success. Going from 5 gpd to 3/4.  
Does it matter much how you spread out the doses through the day?  
If I take one dose that's similar to the doses I used to take, will I be back to the same dependency?  
Some days I take a couple of 2 gpd doses, other times one bigger one and that's it.   


I usually start withdrawing after about 16-24 hours. I've been doing 5 gpd for about two months, and I've been dabbling a total of 2 years with Kratom. While it has a great power over me mentally because of my personality and my depression (that's more under control than it's ever been yay), it is a good time to quit without feeling all that miserable, in my experience. I've done social things and simply being a bit active can manage symptoms very well. 

I think I'm going to be able to do this. but let's see first.  


I'll say it another time; get out before it's (too) late!  
You probably do not need it in your life, and its addictive potential is definitely one of the more insidious drugs. So if you are on a 5-10 gpd habit and think it's not too bad, I can totally relate.   
But I would also say.. Maybe it's better to put an end to it now. But everyone's different, of course.

In addition to the physical change that shows in lack of physical comfort, I feel like I am depressed at different times of the day. Honestly, I am in a long distance relationship. This relationship started 2 decades ago, then we were  separated 10 years ago, then we are back now (early 2021) but in different countries. While we are still love, I feel like I am depressed much more than before I started tapering. I can’t till if this is due to the nature of this relationship or it is just because I dropped my Kratom dose. I also was using perc until 2 weeks ago then I couldn’t get a refill. I used to take Kratom and perc daily; Kratom in the morning and perc 2nd half of the day. I feel like I am killing myself but don’t know why. Is it the tapering or the relationship or both. Sometimes I think I shouldn’t have tapered, but then think this is because of this new old relationship. Anyone in similar situation or at least have an advise.",1,0

Life is as it should be. Some days are good, some aren’t. Sometimes I’m tired and don’t want to do anything. Sometimes I feel good and productive. Just the regular ebbs and flows of life and I’m glad for every moment of it without Kratom.

I’ve been thinking what many of us must go through when we quit after a long time using. Finding ourselves again. Who are we off K? Are we still the same people we were before? The same person that led us to using, for whatever reason, in the first place? I don’t think so. At least I don’t think we have to be. We are stronger for overcoming our addictions and every single one of us has something to contribute. So if you’re still in the early stages of recovery (like me) and you don’t know what you’re going to do, start by looking. Get yourself out of the house and look around. Ask yourself how you can help someone. In the pursuit of helping others we may be able to find happiness within. When we achieve that we won’t have to use.

This is how I’ve been going about things anyway. Hope some of you can get some use out of this.

Keep crushing your goals guys.

I keep seeing people say music gets so much more amazing and I've been like huh, ok.

So this eve I'm working on a new hula hoop trick - two hoops, sort of like juggling but no tosses, lots of spinning and arm crosses and grip changes. It's known to be tough and often called the patting your head and rubbing your belly of hoop tricks.

Been working on it for weeks, pretty much every day. Counting beats, counting spins, left right left right over under over under, spin on hand, spin on thumb, switch, drop hoop, get tangled, try again ... 

But tonight I stumbled on this beautiful flamenco/rumba album and became totally immersed, just completely swept away, and boom - there it was!! My trick!! Doing itself right there!! I couldn't have counted what I was doing if my life depended on it - it was pure feeling. Music and motion. And it wasn't practice or work - it was bliss. Like tears in my eyes bliss.

Then I came inside and wanted ""bonus""  kratom to celebrate. But nooooooo way. Not ruining this with the guilt and disappointment of that. 

Coming back to the world is hard and such a slog sometimes but holy shit these moments of beauty.

Tried to get the shot during that period of time but they said you can’t get the vaccine while you have an active infection. Now that the tooth and the infection is gone I’m ready for the shot but am concerned about w/d causing side effects. My reason being that kratom seems to have a direct effect on my immune system. I’ve been using it since 2011 and I’ve gotten sick while on it less than 5 times total. Seems like it’s almost impossible for me to get sick while on it but then, like clockwork, I catch a cold the first month or so off of it. 

Say I get the shot tomorrow and then quit kratom ~3 days afterwards to make sure there are no side effects. Does this sound like a good plan?

Another weird thing: when I quit 4 months ago(keep in mind I’ve quit many times before) I developed SEVERE cat allergies over night. Went from having them on my lap to having my eyes and throat swell shut if I get too close. Lined up perfectly with quitting kratom. This is also adding to my anxiety. Like, what if the allergies i developed cross over and make me sick from the shot?

Anyways, if any of you all got the shot while in w/d and survived to tell the tale(lol) I’d love some encouragement!

I've read the rules, read a lot of your stories and did a little research into what I can expect for the next month.

I picked a pack at a vape shop sometime in Nov last year and it quickly became a habit. At the time I was running about 10 miles a week, excelling at a JAVA course so I make the move out of systems and into dev. I had a nice remote relationship with possible band members writing and creating some really cool music. All that stuff quickly became secondary to this shit.

This stuff has stolen a sizable portion of my exercise routine, sex life, creativity and work productivity. Omg fuck this shit it. I don't care what the shills say, it should be illegal. My failed attempts at tapering are always a joke so I'm going at it CT now. My unknowing wife is out of town for a week so what better time to get this show on the road.

I've worked up to taking A LOT every day, well past a meaningful ROI. I only measured with tablespoons so amounts are guestimations so here's the best history I could come up with:


month 1    - November 15th? everyother day went to daily pretty quick

month 2    - Dec - Daily 

month 3    - Jan - usually 5 grams or more taken more than 2 times per day

month 4    - Feb - usually 5 grams or more taken more than 2 times per day

month 5    - Mar - usually 5 grams or more taken more than 2 times per day

month 6    - Apr - usually 5 grams or more taken more than 3 times per day

month 7    - May - usually 6 grams or more taken more than 3 times per day

month 8    - June usually 7 grams or more taken more than 3 times per day

So I have used kratom daily for 9 months. Quite big amounts, didn't even count, just re-dosed every 2-3 hours. Lately I found it to ruin my life and I didn't even enjoy the high, just did it for the sake off it.

Now I am 48 hours since my last dose. I did taper down a week before going to zero. It was not that bad for me physically. The mental fight was the hardest. My girlfriend gave me the doses during the day and kept track, also hid the keatom from me.

Now to my issue. I can only sleep for 4-5 hours and then waking up, not feeling rested but still clear wake. Can't get back to sleep at all. Also my heart is pounding harder. When can I get proper sleep again?",3,0

I wasn’t a heavy sub user (about 3 halves a week) but as many of you know suboxone is an insanely potent drug so it was enough to make me experience really bad PAWS. I would scream at my wife and call her terrible names, I smashed a $1,200 acoustic guitar, I put holes in the walls of our home and was just an all around angry and shitty person. I guess I also need to say that through all of this I’ve been an alcoholic. I drink about 12 to 18 beers a day depending on if I have to go to work the next day or not. If anybody knows about the gasoline and fire reaction that alcohol and Suboxone has when mixed, you’ll understand. But anyway enough of my rambling. When I started taking kratom about 6 months ago I would use about an ounce a day (28 grams)About a week ago I dropped my dose down to 7.5 grams a day and the first five days were hell. I have a very addictive personality and I’m very surprised I was able to stick with three doses of 7.5 grams a day. I’m finally starting to feel normal again.

I have read through your posts every night for quite some time, trying to muster up the courage to post myself. I started using kratom 8 years ago when I was 22. I became a daily user off the bat after dabbling with opiates in high school and college. I’ve managed to keep my daily use relatively low, 5-8gm per day. I typically am using 1-2gm about every 4 hours. I have tried to stop but can’t follow through. I have tapered to 1gm twice per day and can maintain on this dose, but I haven’t been able to make the jump beyond this. When I try, I cave and buy more. Using kratom has become my identity. I have hidden my addiction to everyone I care about. I’ve managed to build a successful life professionally and have a boyfriend of 5 years. All of this is hollow and insignificant because it is shadowed by my secret addiction. I don’t know who I am without kratom. I wonder what my personality would be like if I wasn’t under the influence of this plant. I’ve realized that in order to successfully quit, I need to talk openly with someone about what I am going through. I carry too much shame to open up to anyone in my personal life. Because of my profession, I have convinced myself that substance abuse treatment is not an option out of fear of being exposed. If you can relate to my post in some way and are willing to talk, please let me know. I desperately want to be honest with someone about my addiction, and am hopeful that doing so will serve as a first step in my actual recovery. I have so much love and respect for you all.

Day 4 was by far the roughest. I woke up with extreme cravings trying to convince myself ""I could use again is moderation"" lol. This last few days I have just had no motivation. I've had all these things I want to do, but its so hard to stand up and actually do them. I'm building a hot dog cart and starting a business, and there is so much work there that needs to be done, and soon. I think thays why I started taking so much, I was convinced it would help me get more done, instead I think it made me slower. I'm getting more anxiety as each day goes by because I need to get up and running and make a living, but it has been very hard.  
  
These last couple days I've been experiencing dissociation along with everything else. My brain kind of hurts. I've been smoking more weed this past week, which I know isn't really helping. I'm just trading one bad habit for another. I've been trying to go for walks. I have my first meeting with a new therapist tomorrow.

I'm not currently posting on the forum a lot as I feel the need to distance myself from kratom use topics, for the time being. But I wanted to post my 60 days update and ask some questions.

Until the last week or so, I've had an unbelievable amount of anxiety. I have always been an anxious person but this was beyond anything that I could have ever imagined. I've got barely functional and some days, non functional at all. It was truly awful and i was just hanging on to dear life. 

However, the last week or so it started improving. The last couple days I feel mostly like myself. I still have a lot of breakthrough anxiety but at least it appears manageable. Im still very sensitized to everything and my tolerance to stress is very low. Today I decided to watch an Alien movie form 1986 with Sigourney Weaver and I had to shut it off half way because it made me anxious. Do you guys think this is PAWS? It should improve as time goes by, right? 

But I have to concentrate on the positives: at least my appetite is improved, I can sleep most nights without meds (although my sleep still is patchy and I wake up with revving heart), and I can function well enough to maintain my current life. I think that I just need to keep taking care of myself as best as I can and take it easy while things are improving.

So I've been using kratom off and on for about 5 years with breaks as short as a few days, or as long as 8 months, at doses ranging from 500mg to 9g. I've never experienced anything that even hinted at withdrawal. I took my last dose around 5 days ago (ish.) Anyway, late on Monday night crippling panic started to sneak in. This is without a doubt the worst anxiety I have ever had (and I've withdrawn from opiates, alcohol, etc... The panic and disassociation has been out of control for 3 days, and I'm starting to feel incredibly scared. Why would I only start experiencing withdrawal now? And how should I proceed from here?

I feel so damn guilty, because it was so helpful for my back issues and anxiety disorder over the years, that I have recommended it to a bunch of people because I never even experienced rebound anxiety with it.

If anyone has had a similar reaction, or has any feedback in general, I'd be so damn grateful.

I've quit four times now. This last run was roughly ten months at \~40-50g/day. Had been off for six or so months prior to relapse. I'd say the last two months were purely maintenance to avoid wd. I wanted to quit again, but was afraid of the misery that comes with it. After doing some research and supplementing, I honestly didn't experience any of the negatives I have in the past - and I wanted to share my experience to help any of you guys that feel like it's too hard to get through. 

I'm 6', 225lb, 20% BF - so my supplementation may vary - but my regimen seemed like it immediately undid any of the 'addiction' (meaning desire for that first morning dose) and negatives that come with quitting. 

For me, my relapses come after six-ish months. I don't have the desire to get back on once I make it over the hump, which for me is the first seven days after stopping. Personally, relapse usually happens after a stressful week at work or too late of a night or something. I get too confident and think, 'I can just have it for a few days and be done'... A few days bleeds into weeks and into months and then I'm back into maintenance to avoid WD. The WD is honestly what keeps me on for prolonged periods. But this time around, I feel like I was able to avoid nearly all WD that scares me. 

I'm on day 10 now - which I know some people may say may not be long enough - but besides the annoying runny nose and constant sneezing, I managed to avoid nearly any/every other negative I've experienced in the past. My supplements were as follows (I don't want to name vendors, but suffice it to say that these products are readily available by major online distributors in the US). 

* L-Tryptophan 1g 3x/day (morning, noon, evening)
* Black Seed Oil 1g 3x/day (morning, noon, evening)
* Neuro Clarity  1 cap 3x/day
   * St. John's Wort 200mg
   * L-Glutamine 75 mg
   * Phosphatidylserine Complex 75mg
   * Bacopa Monnier Leaf Extract 75mg
   * N-Acetyl L-Carnitine HCL 50mg
   * DMAE 50mg
   * Ginkgo Biloba Leaf 50mg
   * Kava Kava 50mg
   * Neem 35mg
* ON Men's Multi Vitamin 1 cap/day (usually evening/before bed)
   * This one I would only take sometimes. I feel like K puts some nutrients into a deficit, so I took this multi the first few days - but as soon as I would notice that bright yellow pee, I'd stop taking it.
   * This also has too many ingredients to list
* CoQ-10 as needed
   * This is actually my go-to when I feel groggy/hung-over. Seems to help me with some of the 'brain fog'
* Some form of high intensity workout around 9am each morning (and a pre workout before hand)
   * my preworkout was ON Storm, but it's pretty basic - I think you could use anything here, just make sure it has:
   * creatine (ideally in a few forms for easy absorption and no need to load)
   * beta alanine
   * carnitine
   * arginine
* Melatonin 3mg 2x before bed
* Restful Legs (4-8 tabs before bed) 
   * I get mad restless legs coming off of a dose like I was on - to the point where I can't sleep worth a damn. This honestly helped me a lot, but it wasn't perfect. Sleep is still hit or miss (but I'm not a heavy/big sleeper sans K anyhow). Still, compared to quitting in the past, this helped me *immensely* 

Every time I quit I'm extremely runny. Like runny nose, runny eyes, runny poop (maybe TMI, but it is what it is). Usually I'm afraid to stop though because of the flu feelings that I get from WD. With this supplementation though, I literally had no yucky, fluishness. Just the runny stuff. 

Day one I had some fatigue, but nothing too extreme. Definitely no flu(ish) feelings. If the fatigue was really bad, I would take a few hundred mg of phenylpiracetam which would help me feel more wakeful and allow me to focus on work while yawning tears and sneezing up a storm. 

I forced myself to do some form of intense workout even when my motivation was in the gutter. I usually lift very heavy and I noticed I was pretty sluggish, so I dialed back the weight quite a bit and did a bunch of high intensity stuff (rucking, running, biking, high volume low weight stuff) to avoid injury. 

Every time I've quit in the past, my family has noticed me being crabby/sick. I've been called out for it every time (although they don't know the cause). This time, everyone immediately mentioned how my attitude was positive and I was happy/more fun to be with.

I love quitting. I get goosebumps again. I feel a lot more emotion. Music gives me the chills again. Its the stuff that K kind of makes me numb to that I don't realize I've lost until I clean up. And damn it feels good.

Anyhow, I hope this helps at least one person out there. Stay strong. You can get through this without any of this stuff too - but this time around I've breezed through what for me, is usually the hardest parts of kicking...",6,0

I started Kratom 3 years ago and went from 135 to 160. The weight is (was) always in my gut. I was always bloated. I thought it was a female thing with aging. It didn't matter how much I would diet and exercise I just couldn't get rid of the bloat and always stayed around 155 to 160 lbs. 

Well, after tapering down real low and stop taking it 4 days ago I noticed last night my belly was gone. Not really but I wasn't bloated. A month ago I had an appointment at my GYNO and weighed in at 160 😳. Today, I went to the doctor again and weighed in at 150! 

There was a part of me that always felt that the kratom was possibly an issue. I wasn't too sure. I didn't eat bad in fact I tried dieting but I always would gain weight or just float around the 155 area.

I had brain surgery when I was 16 due to a car accident and a pre-existing condition called Arnold Chiari Malformation, had a second car accident where my front jaw was smashed and I lost all my front teeth. I've struggled with severe TMJ where my jaw dislocates, and issues with scoliosis from the car accident, muscle and nerve damage where I had surgery, and so I've spent the last 13 years in and out of pain management.

I started out addicted to hydrocodone, went to dilaudid, then morphine ER, then made my way to oxycodone, cocaine, then fentanyl laced oxy, suboxone, back to oxycodone, and finally onto just kratom. I've been 'clean' before for long stretches, but I was always on something like kratom. For the first time, I've made it 5 days without any kratom, (technically it'll be 6 days at 9pm tonight).

I can't believe I did it. I'm in pain from my chronic pain, but it's bearable. I spent all that time thinking I couldn't live without something in my body.

I'm eternally grateful for what kratom did for me, but I am SO FUCKING HAPPY TO FINALLY BE FREE OF IT.",245,0

I was suffering from panic attacks before I quit, just wondering if anyone else whose had these has experienced fatigue and exhaustion after for some time, I assume it's due to the stress of the panic attack or something?

One bit of advice someone on here gave was when you feel like crap just think about how bad you have felt in the past, like when having a panic attack or severe depression, then realise that even though you don't feel higher than life right now, you feel a whole lot better than you did on those past occasions.",8,0

I was recently hospitalized two weeks ago with a ruptured stomach ulcer and had to be rushed into emergency surgery. I started having stomach pains back in November of 2020 and I could tell it was because of the Kratom capsules I was taking. I went from taking at least 25 caps at once for at least 4 times a day. Tapered down a lot over the months and got down to only 6 capsules around 4 times a day to see if it helped with my stomach. Sure enough, it didn't. The stomach pains barely came around the lower the dose was, so I wasn't too worried about it until randomly my stomach started to turn like someone was ripping through my guts. Needless to say, I had surgery and the doctor told me that the Kratom could have caused a lot of acid in my stomach which caused the ulcer. So I've quit right then and there and it's been two weeks. Each day has gotten better but I also had to quit nicotine at the same time. So it makes me want Kratom even more. But it feels so good to be off of it, I feel free even though it's a mental battle. I've read that it could take months to start feeling normal. After seeing the scar on my stomach from having surgery....I'm definitely too scared to do Kratom again.

They gave me a folder and a brochure for a medication called ""Sublocade"". I know Suboxone isn't any better than the kratom to many people (in my opinion kratom is worse) but I am getting a sublocade shot next Wednesday. Basically they inject liquid buprenorphine into your subcutaneous tissue and it forms a gel. The gel then administers the medication into your blood stream at a constant rate covering a consistent blood level without you having to worry about taking anything, it stops the withdrawal (from what my doctor told me) for up to six months, but you can get it monthly if needed. If you stop the injection, the drug essentially automatically tapers you off and works its way out of your system without any withdrawal and then boom, home free. I will let you guys know how it goes, but I just thought I'd throw it out there for anybody that doesn't already know about it. So far the Suboxone therapy is working very well and I'm doing way better now than I was two weeks ago (was taking 80 gpd). I highly encourage anybody who is trying to quit and is unable to taper to seek professional help as I am surly glad I did at this point. You don't have to do it alone!

Just waiting til my dose is low enough that I no longer feel the rocks and dirt underneath my feet with every step but instead the fresh air of me flying down this cliff into freedom. 

Freedom from this addiction that has done more damage to my life than good. Freedom from the shackles of withdraw. Freedom from this lazy lifestyle I’ve succumb to from Kratom. 

I need to jump. I need to do it. I’ll be pushed off the cliff by the last bit of motivation I have tomorrow. As Kratom has ruined my once fearless and thriving positive mental attitude. I want it back. I need it back. It’s time.",15,0

 I've been doing about 20 gpd for 3 months and realized the other day that I can't stop! I casually tried to quit a couple times last month, and I started to feel the beginnings of withdrawal symptoms. I've read about them on here. Very scary. I had no idea I had gotten myself into the weeds already, I honestly didn't think 3 months would be enough, but here we are. Its confusing, because I took kratom consistently in 2018-2019 and was able to quit CT no problem. I guess I've just been taking more per day this time, because by the second  day off I definitely start feeling some bad stuff. 
Anyway, yesterday I found you guys, and I'm very thankful I did. I've read the taper guide, and I think this is the way to go for me. I'm decreasing down from 20 gbd to 10 gbd and I'm going to try and ride that out for a couple weeks and then drop again. I feel like I can do this.
I can't believe I've gotten myself into this position in such a short time, but withdrawals are withdrawals and now I gotta beat them. I have to say again, I'm so glad I found all of you. I was seriously having a hard time figuring out what to do, all the while still taking 20g of kratom a day and biding my time. I think the taper is the way to go for me for sure. I'm telling you all because I appreciate you for your words and your own personal battles. I'm also telling you because I don't want to feel completely alone in what I'm about to do.

I noticed my throat was feeling really dry so I chugged my 32oz water bottle and within 15 minutes BAM the fatigue is gone. I'm feeling suddenly so much more positive and energized. I'm guessing I lost a bunch of water from night sweats and the few sips here and there wasn't nearly enough to replenish the dehydration.

I have been on kratom for a few years now, quit June 2nd  between 20gpd to 40gpd to 90gpd, I quit cold turkey, one day I just woke up and had no cravings at all. So I said to myself I wanted to see how far this can go. I take kratom for severe back pain. My pain is an easy 10, seen several Dr about it and they did a xray not showing anything wrong. That's the reason I turned to kratom. Since I quit I have been going through heavy withdrawal, sneezing 3 times every 20 min. Rls, nothing seems fun anymore but that doesn't bother me. I have extreme insomnia now. I stayed awake 3 days straight the first few days. Then 28 hours. I stayed up since 4am yesterday. That's because of how bad my back hurts. So I want to let anyone that is quitting you got this. I am in constant pain and agony to the point where seems hopeless. I will eat withdrawal symptoms for breakfast. If I can quit with excruciating back pain 24/7. A little withdrawal is very doable, believe in yourself. Things that helped me so far.
Music has helped me tremendously, I just take random drives and listen to music. It's so therapeutic  it's unimaginable. Def give it a shot. 
Taking vitamin c and multi vitamins. 
Melatonin doesn't work the only sleep I've gotten is because of delta 8 which is only a few hours. 
I exercise and stretch daily to help back muscles. 
I actually traded my kratom for the delta which was a blessing. 
Taking around 6 hot baths a day.

I have never been on other opioids really other than as prescribed so I assumed it would not affect me when I stop. Well last week out of the blue I was like ""wait, why am I taking this? I don't even feel like it's doing anything for me"". So I just stopped. By the next day I was having chills, sweating, headache, leg pains, and lots of rls at night. Now on day 5 I am physically feeling a lot better, however last night the rls was still there and the pains in my legs as well. Anyways I'm experiencing extreme depression, emotionalness/crying a lot, loneliness, existential dread and all that that does not seem to be wavering at all.

Hi to all my fellow quitters, last days have been extremely difficult for me for multiple reasons but one thing left me in a great shock though it's not that surprising now when I think about that. And believe me, my brain is something like perpetuum mobile these days. 

Let's make the long story a little bit shorter: we got a little drunk with my BF on last Friday night, went to bed and everything seemed to be fine. I noticed he was somewhat stressed but attributed it to kids and too much work. Unexpectedly, my boyfriend just stated: ""We have to break up. I'm so tired of this situatuon, it's not progressing anywhere, I'm angry you just sleep or rest all the time while I need to work, I'm not comfortable with you staying at home all the time, it ruins my ability to focus on anything. I'm emotionaly void (for the reasons mentioned)."" While I cried in shock and pain, he kept talking and everything made sense; of course it did! I had to admit I did literally NOTHING to make our relationship thrive for months. I just kept hiding from myself and others thinking pain, anxiety and discomfort will just vanish into thin air if I numb them enough. Also, my boyfriend doesn't believe me I did quit K days prior to our conversation but I can't really blame him as I'm not sure what I would do in the same situation. 

I don't want to add more details now as I'm exhausted, I'm currently looking for a psychotherapist to discuss possible further steps. However, I found out that crying really helps which is weird as it usually works opposite for me. 

Despite the crisis, my overall condition has been improving. I walk a lot, started excercising and finally able to eat/ drink something without major nausea. No cravings. My chronic knee pain is almost nonexistent. Losing weight quickly but it was needed indeed.

He had many reasons to use it, I’m learning that we all do, but it did help him quit drinking. My mom was actually about to buy a “health spa” where the current owner sold Kratom. So I figured since my mom was about to be in the K world and my boyfriend is, I’ll give it a go. (Thank god, the owner of the store turned out to be sketch and my mom backed out) The first time, I was hooked. I don’t think I went to many days without Kratom since then. I am a non-traditional college student and I work full time. So I always used Kratom to stay focused and awake, until it did the exact opposite to me. At that point there were days where I was taking more than my boyfriend and I had started 2 years after him. We are talking a disgusting amount of green sludge. I finally decided I’ve had enough, and since there isn’t much out there when you google “quitting Kratom”, other than all the terrible things your going to feel, I ended up here on this... so I quit CT April 30th, 2021. I’ve been lurking through each and every post on here weekly. It’s helped me so much!! Thank you for everything community!! I have never used Reddit. I don’t even know if I’m posting this correctly lol. But I couldn’t have done it without popping on here to see what everyone else had to say, and knowing I wasn’t alone.

I didn’t have terrible pain or insomnia past 2 weeks of CT. I didn’t take anything else. I just walked outside more, did more projects around the house, really just stayed busy. I never really craved it. I just tried to remember how crappy my life had started to feel, I couldn’t do anything without Kratom, and then when I tried to use it for a boost, it just made everything seem 20x more challenging. I knew on day 3 when I felt the worst, that there was no way in hell I would ever go back to K. If something can make you feel that terrible, it is not worth it. 

So I’m 5.5 weeks into my journey. Here’s where I am at.... 

I’m struggling to get back on a normal routine since quitting. I realized that my old routine was formed around needing a scoop. So I haven’t really hit my flow yet. That’s what my goal is this week. ROUTINE. I’m definitely still dealing with the weird side effects that are less noticeable. Like trying to figure out what my routine for work, school and life have been. Lol

Cravings... my boyfriend still takes Kratom, and the smell of it when he takes it or comes near me after, is so disgusting. I cannot believe I ever used to put that shit in my body. I hate smelling it. It literally makes nausea overwhelming instantly. Because of that, I don’t really experience cravings. I wish he would quit....

Diet...I don’t know why, but this last 5 days, I have craved nothing but sugar! And that’s very unlike me. I typically eat fruits and veggies non stop and we just eat extremely healthy. But I don’t have a lot of motivation to cook and I crave shitty food. So first thing in the routine.... making time to cook every meal again! 

Other than that, I just want my motivation back! I’m so proud for quitting CT, it was a challenge and I was proud. The first two weeks were not as bad for me as they are for some. What’s been the biggest challenge for me is finding my groove again. Finding myself.",10,0

I don't know what to make of it but I hope it will pass. My Therapist in inpatient told me kratom is linked to mental illness and that it wreaks havoc on your mind and body. I'm just grateful to never have to drink that foul shit ever again. I guess what I'm trying to get at is escape this addiction anyway you can.

I started a rapid taper 3 weeks ago. Immediately dropped to 10gpd for a week. Then 5gpd for a week before jumping. 

I'm not sure why this quit has been easier than past attempts. I think I'm just burnt out of kratom. It literally does nothing for me. While some people say they don't get high anymore, they just take it to feel normal, I don't even feel normal when I take it. I'm constantly anxious, never able to sleep well, chronically constipated, withering away from not eating, bad memory, poor social life, etc. I think I'm just at a point where I'd rather feel the withdrawals. I've just accepted I'm always going to feel like crap whether I'm using or not, so why not quit.

Anyway, made it to day 7. I've worked every day except the weekend through it. The chills are finally starting to let up a little. I'm still sneezing all the time, but I'm weird. I actually enjoy the sneezes. They give me a small hit of something that gives me relief for a split second. Since I've been able to work through the heaviest of the acutes, my anxiety about being able to work while withdrawing since I've proven I can has abated so that's nice. One other positive I've noticed is my shakes are completely gone! For about the last year, I've been getting random tremors throughout the day that get really bad when I get nervous about something. It even affects my legs and my knees will shake while I'm working 30 feet in the air on a ladder (very dangerous). Well, it must have been the kratom causing that because they've disappeared. 

Still have sever anhedonia. I'll pull out my guitar every now and then but it kind of depresses me to see how much I've regressed from not playing for so long.

This jump started my want to cold turkey, and the day I stopped taking kratom almost all of my pain went away...but I noticed the constipation hasn't left. I haven't gone since I quit.

The only problems i have are sleep, sweating, sneezing and diarrhea, weed helps my sleep and im fighting the diarrhea with loperamide. Yesterday i took my loperamide sublingual and it felt like it helped with almost all of the withdrawal symptoms. 

i didn't sweat anymore i got pretty tired/relaxed and i stopped sneezing. I know that loperamide is an opioid that doesnt or only very lightly crosses the blood-brain barrier.

So now to my actual questions: is it possible that the loperamide crossed my blood brain-barrier more because i took it sublingualy (fist pass effect) and if so im asking myself how bad that is for my tolerance.

The other question is: if i keep taking loperamid for 1-2 weeks, will i have slight withdrawal/rebound from it

There’s no urge, there’s no contemplation, no desire, in fact I remember the withdrawals so much more clearly than any good feeling Kratom ever gave me. The bouts of crying, insomnia, constant anxiety and unbelievably dark depression. I remember feeling like the world was just full of pain. Truthfully, the worst experience of my life. 

For those going through something similar, don’t feel discouraged if you can’t find anything to relieve your discomfort or pain. It’s a bargaining tactic, your body makes you feel like Kratom is the only option because through the habit you’ve trained your body to see it as beneficial to our survival. I know what it feels like to read encouraging words and feel nothing. I know what it feels like to be up at night, alone and wondering if it will ever end. 

It truly was a unique experience for me, as it was the first time in my life where nothing could consolidate the distress I was under besides rest and sleep. Exercise somewhat helped but the distress returned very soon. But you will not be stuck there forever. You are not the first human to go through this, nor are you the last. Remember: this experience is not you. You are simply sick and recovering. If it wasn’t painful, you would have no reason to not relapse.

Don’t be hard on yourself. You’re going through one of the toughest things possible. Take pride in that. Good luck.

Also: you save money. Lots of money. Enjoy that bonus.

I wish that someone told me how bad quitting was going to suck before starting.

But I’m 10 hours in since my last dose and I’m pumped. I have to be honest, hours 9 and 10 got tough. I was good until then. Busy day of cleaning the garage and running errands. But once the work was done the crawling skin and sick feeling came back. I’m so glad I dumped all of my power! If I had just thrown it away in the bags I know I would have fished it out of the trash. Yes, I’m that addict. 

Ok, on to my question. In the supplement thread it mentions Kava as a way to help with anxiety, and maybe sleep. I decided to buy some kava powder and one of those shakers to make strong kava at home. (Trying to avoid brand names) let’s just say, it’s helping. No where close to a dose of K, the body aches don’t budge, but it’s a slight push in the right direction for the anxiety or desire to cave to the cravings. 

I took an epsom salt bath about an hour ago and had a preview of what the nights are going to be like. Last time I tried to quit it was the RLS that made me eventually buy some more K. I’ve told myself that’s not an option this time. It’s getting ridiculously expensive to keep my level of usage up.

I have read a lot of people having discomfort or pain on their right side around the liver. Im experiencing this as well, my pain lingers up and down my right side all around the ribs and even gets down lower sometimes. I’m most nervous about my kidneys or my liver being damaged, maybe even the GI tract. 

I got blood and urine tests done about a week into my quit because of the various symptoms I was having and how they lined up with liver damage. The tests all came back healthy with no protein in urine, normal bilirubin levels, etc. I have recently started having bubbly urine and still having these Pains/discomfort on my right side.

I’d like to hear from anyone who has had these symptoms and if there were any actual problems or if they just took time to heal themselves. I just figured after 1 month they would be better if it was solely withdrawals.

This is my first time posting on Reddit! This group finally brought me to create an account. So far I feel I've gotten a lot from it so thank you guys. I wanted to share a little bit about my story. 

I started drinking kratom every once in awhile years ago. I didn't start drinking it regularly until the start of the pandemic. Drinking alcohol got really boring to do at home and I loved the calmness that red kratom brought me. A little bit of background... I have struggled with anxiety since I was a preteen and am currently on an SSRI. The SSRI has helped keep my anxiety stable and under control, but the red kratom helped me cope with stressors from the day and helped me sleep. Over this past year, I started off with 1 cup every night and up to 4 cups, each containing 7g, I believe. So that would make it that i was up to 28gpd over the last 4-6 months. I'm also female and 5'1"" so this was a good enough amount to do the job. I was fine with this. I had accepted I'm addicted and felt it was the lesser of all evils. Especially compared to alcohol since alcohol really fucked with my emotions. Since kratom, I was more chill and didn't have as many stupid arguments with my husband either.

But here's the thing, my husband and I have been trying to conceive for the last 2 years. We went through all these fertility tests (well, mostly me since there are so many things that can happen  in the female body), and our fertility doctor could not pinpoint our issue. ""It must be something chemically"" she said. Basically, it's unexplained infertility. However, I was never honest with her about my kratom usage. After reading some of the posts on here, it seems that kratom can fuck with your hormones. I feel so guilty. I mean, could kratom have contributed to our infertility issue? I mean, we were already struggling a year before I started regularly drinking it. I like to think not, but it's likely.

So anyway, our fertility doc says she feels we can have success in pregnancy through IUI. So, this last weekend, i had the procedure done. The nurse who did the procedure said I have 3 mature follicles and it was likely I could have twins or even triplets! I'll find out in 2 weeks whether the procedure was successful (yay!). But right after she finished the procedure, she drops the bomb ""you have to start acting like your pregnant right away."" This means I gotta eat like I'm pregnant and that means I have to stop drinking kratom.

Fuck, I thought I had more time to wean myself off. I don't know what I was thinking I guess. But I didn't think I needed to stop so soon. So I found this forum and am so glad I did because it has prepared me for some of the symptoms. After going through and reading some of the posts on here, I decided I had to quit CT. Especially considering that I don't want to do anything to risk our chances of not getting pregnant or causing any birth defects if we are, even if it is so early.

My days have been mostly fine so far, but the nights have been awful. I'm feeling restless, tossing, turning, and my anxiety and the cravings are HIGH. For sleep, I started taking Unisom (since it has been found to be the safest sleep aid for pregnancy). I started taking that last night and can't tell if me feeling so drowsy today is from the Unisom or a part of the withdrawals. Maybe I need to be taking half. I know it's not symptoms of pregnancy because I wouldn't feel those until about 1-2 weeks after conception. 

Anyway, I wanted to share my story to see if anyone else relates or for any encouraging words, cause this has been pretty tough... to go from using kratom to help me relax and sleep for the last year to quitting cold turkey. It's nice having a place to share my story where I don't feel judged.",11,1

Gonna start taking my dropper and removing 2 ml (out of 15ml) and reducing 1 ml every 3 days or so as needed. I have a trip with my dad for a week on July 24. He’s getting older and has onset early dementia, so it means a lot that I’m normal by the time I leave, as it may be one of my last times with him fully available mentally. I’m also planning (and hoping - covid willing) to leave mid-November for a 6-8 month backpacking trip through Southeast Asia. That trip means more to me than anything, so I’m quitting not just for my dad and that trip, but for myself to truly be healthy to enjoy my vacation. If my plan goes well, I’ll be done by July 8-10. I’ll be keeping a personal diary daily, and trying to keep up with posting when I can remember. I know there are threads for daily updates, but I would rather have my own thread. Mostly to know it won’t get lost in the mix. 
Been on the shots (2/day - one AM, one PM) since may 2020, so about a year. Already kicked opiates twice, so I know I can do it... but withdrawals are a scary beast especially working in a restaurant where I can’t afford to take off without being let go, since I’m taking all these vacations.
Wish me luck, LEGGGOOOOO

EDIT-
Starting on day 5, taper still intact. Saved one less bottle of my shots so far wooo $14 lol. 
I’ve been keeping a journal I will gladly post when I have a bit more time, if people want it. There isn’t really a play by play taper on here I’ve found from a common brand of k(ratom) shots. Overall, jumped down to 13 ml first 2 days without any issues. Today is my last day of 12ml before jumping down to 11ml tomorrow and 10ml Monday. My off days are tue, wed, Thursday at which point I’ll be down to stabilize at 9 ml by Friday in 6 days. I expect those jumps to be not as fun, but it won’t be as bad as full withdrawal, and I can’t afford to suffer at work. There hasn’t been much discomfort at all, just find myself craving a bit when I’m about an hour away from my dose time of 10 pm. Sleep has been good, which is most important for me on my work days. The most impactful issue I’ve had is a bit sweatier, but it’s all a mental game in that aspect and much better than any type of cold turkey withdrawal. I don’t expect it to be easy, but I want to make it easier for myself when I do drop it in about 4 weeks from now. All in all, if you really want to quit, you gotta stay strong mentally. My best friend passed away at 29 years of age, (best friends for 18 years, daily texting and hanging out mostly every weekend) and I’m using his death as motivation to better myself.

I'm pretty proud of myself for it and the first 2 month were pretty tough. But I dont have withdrawals anymore and I can happily say I dont even think about kratom anymore. 

On the other hand, I am constantly tired, have absolutely no motivation and feel depressed and irritated so much. Before kratom I loved life so much, and then I guess I got bored and thats how I found kratom and it gave me this drive to love life even more than I already did. Especially to write music. I find myself only wanting to either sleep or watch some random show. And before, I was never that person. I only slept because I had to and I stayed away from TV all together. I can still go to my job to afford the bills I have, I also just graduated college. My life's going great but I lack the motivation and happiness to want to get up and do something. Maybe I'm working too much? I work all day Saturday and Sunday, and then I deliver for dominoes and grub hub during the week in the evenings. I live alone and have been working on being ok without a partner for the past year, I also still get panick attacks every now and then, though not every day like I did the first 2 months getting off kratom. I'm not sure how to get back to that mindset of loving life and finding joy in everything. Part of me thinks I let the last girl I was talking to really steer me into the wrong direction with my outlook on life, and another part of me thinks that kratom severely messed up my overall mental state. FOR THE RECORD: if you are working on getting off kratom, YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY DO IT. Life is so much better not being dependent on something four to 5 times a day.

I guess I'm just venting, but also would love if anyone has any opinions on any of this?

Hey quitters! I didn’t post yesterday but it was an okay day. One thing on my mind today is how long it took me to actually quit. After months of feeling like shit mentally and physically I started seeing a therapist hoping they would hold me accountable to a taper schedule. It worked for a couple of weeks and then I started deviating from the taper schedule every couple of days. At one point, for a couple days, I got down to about 10gpd. That was huge coming from 80 but it didn’t last long. Before I knew it I was back at 40. I ended up getting a different therapist and also a psych doc. 

The psych doc gave me everything I asked for so quitting was going to be easy right? Wrong. I found myself taking the comfort meds AND 40gpd of K and lying to both my psych and therapist about how much K I was taking while I was supposed to be on a taper.

Of course all of these things added up to just making me feel worse than before. Then I had an opportunity to take a trip by myself to see people I could trust to help me without judgment. It was a six day trip. The day after I arrived was the last day I used. It sucked to feel like shit while on vacation but even though K was sold in every shop I suffered through withdrawals.

When I got back home I decided that it wasn’t worth reliving those five days again so I have stayed clean. I’ve just tried to stay busy and exercise. That and filling my brain with music, reading and spending time on this sub have all been a huge help to keep me clean.

Looking back at it now I wish I had just made a plan to CT and stuck to it. It would have made the entire process so much easier. I just can’t taper.

The past few days have been fine. Nothing amazing except not using K.

Anyway, just wanted to make my daily post.

I have uses this method before to get thru tianep withdrawals in 4 days.

So any way after clean from tia for months starting messing with kratom (which was a waste my opiod receptors are trashed from tia) the only thing kratom did was lower my anxiety noticibly and so i used for a year.

Eventually i ended up dosing 6-12 grams every 3-4 hours and couldn’t eat because the food im my stomach would make me start withdrawals.


So realizing this is a problem deceided to take 4 days off work and do how i did with tia to be free.

Yes this method could be dangerous and be hell if your awake while the naltrexone is wiping your receptors.


Day 1: No rls/ had anxiety/ runny nose and eyes.

Day 2: Just anxiety

I took half a teaspoon just about an hour ago and it didn’t do anything. It didn’t stop the craving or make me feel like I’d get a break from the crawling skin. 

I bought some black seed oil, some vitamin C and some Kava Kava powered to help with the anxiety. I feel like as long as I know I have some K in the house I’ll always give in and take a dose faster than my schedule. Plus it feels like I’m prolonging the inevitable. This is going to suck.

If any of you are hesitating about making the drop, tapering is a God send and you should absolutely consider doing one. I'll never stop advocating for tapering, even if you don't think you have the willpower, there's a taper for everyone. There's no set time limit on how fast you have to taper, as long as you're going down. I went from 40g to 5g in about a month and a half, and it's made the world of a difference. The taper I did was painless and slow enough that I felt no withdrawals. I could have tapered even lower, but decided to drop due to severe GI problems that sent me to the hospital. 

I currently have some very mild withdrawals (sneezing, mild RLS/insomnia, increased pain, runny nose/eyes, a little bit of anxiety and lethargy), but they're so mild I keep wondering if this is really it. I'm literally able to walk around and do things, which was impossible with opiate withdrawal. THIS is what I was hyping up in my head for so long? Well damn.

Vivitrol, known generically as naltrexone, blocks the effects of opioid medications (Including kratom since it acts as an opioid!) including pain relief or feelings of well-being that can lead to opioid abuse. You will have protection from a relapse for a month, plus it curbs cravings to virtually zero for me! The naltrexone pills work as well, but you could just decide on one bad day you wanna start the sludge again and just not take it that day. I have not seen it talked about a lot here, but I have a lot of experience with it. Once a month shot in the butt that takes no time to get. No side effects for me either. Every insurance company I have seen pays it in full for a whole year (cheaper than sending your butt to rehab over and over again😂) and any doctor will gladly prescribe and find a place for you to get the injection. Some specialty pharmacies will not even require a script for it. You must be clean for 7-10 days first or you could go back into withdrawals, but I would STRONGLY recommend you guys to look into it if you serious about quitting and staying quit.

It helped me with withdrawal from other drugs and later kept using it to get work done, but now it is hindering me more than helping..  having alot of GI issues lately

My habit is 15gr per day, used to be more but my stomach can't handle it anymore.

How I will do it is:

\- first lower at once tomorrow morning to: 4 x 1gr per day

\- then after 3-7 days I will go from 4gr to zero

I will use these supplements and medicine to ease the process:

\- Vitamin C

\- Magnesium bisglycinate

\- Ashwaganda

\- L theanine

\- bacopa monieri

\- Lemon balm/valerian/passionflower for sleep

\- Low dose mirtrazapine or seroquel & melatonin for sleep

When I go to zero I will use cerebrolysin at 10ml dosages every 2nd or 3rd day. This enhances neuroplasticity and is speculated (or is it fact even?) to speed up recovery processes in the brain from drug (ab)use. I will also use lions mane and add extra cardio to aid this process even more.

IF anyone has some extra tips or questions please don't hesitate

It can be lonely withdrawing from drugs so with this post I am looking for some support and to support others on the same journey.

I went to bed last night feeling sick and a huge floater in my field of vision.  It’s still here today.  I read on here that someone else had this possibly from kratom use, and they think it’s permanent.  My husband and I are both users for about 5 years.  We use roughly 1 kilo per week.  I think I use more than he does,  2 very very heaping teaspoons every 3-4 hours.  I make capsules for use at work, 20 size 000 (the largest) caps twice during a shift.  You can imagine how much time it takes to make all of those capsules.  I am a recovering alcoholic.  I will have 5 years on June 30. I thought kratom would help, and it did help me through the restless, irritable and discontent….for a while.   I attend AA regularly, and I feel kind of like a fraud and like I’ve cheated.  It’s the dishonesty that kills me.  Now, like every other substance I have been addicted to, it has turned on me.  I am a slave to kratom.  And more often than not,  it makes me feel worse in some ways than it makes me feel better. Probably because I am overdosing myself trying to get back to feeling good again.  
But I have had enough tastes of withdrawal to know that I fear it.  I’ve been through alcohol and drug (benzo and opiate) withdrawal (CT).  But for some reason, kratom withdrawal seems worse.  I’m going to try to taper starting today.  I don’t think I will be able to function cold turkey and still work.

I understand that I have a very high tolerance at this point but this seems different. It seems like I’ve messed up my dopamine receptors for good. It makes me want to quit ASAP but at the same time I’m scared to quit now because what if I can never get back to normal.

I always have been and always will be. I am an ex heroin user, alcoholic, and would take any drug I came across. It ruined my life and the relationships with my family. By the end of my addiction I was living in a homeless shelter with only a small backpack of clothes to my name. I got sober in 2012 thanks to a 12 step program and with the help of some of the best people I’ve ever met. I then preceded to repair my relationships, and met my soon to be wife. I lived the greatest years of my life for the following 5 years. That was until I came across Kratom. 

How could I have been so stupid to think I could take a substance like Kratom and not experience any consequences? I bought into the hype of Kratom being “non addictive” and no worse than coffee. I convinced myself that I could have my cake and eat it to. So I bought some. 

It didn’t take me long to go from taking regular leaf to upgrading to the pure alkaloid extract. From there my addiction took off like a rocket and I found myself taking a gram of the pure alkaloid every day. This is expensive as a gram of this is about $35. Thanks to me getting sober in 2012 I was able to get some things in my life together and got a really good job making good money. So I could afford it I thought. I justified to myself  that I worked hard and deserved to treat myself. Eventually it was nothing to spend over $1200 a month on my addiction.  

This went on for about 3.5 years. My wife was aware of my past addiction to heroin and would raise concerns over my Kratom usage and I would always blow it off as not a big deal. I found myself hiding the money I was spending on it because money at home was getting tighter but I was going to get my Kratom no matter what. I didn’t want her to see we actually did have the money for the bills I was just pissing it away. She’s not stupid but I treated her like she was. This has no doubt has put a strain on our marriage. 

We were able to stay afloat because my wife was working and I would pick up extra hours to help supplement the money I was spending. Just writing this makes me see how big of a piece of shit I am. 

My attempt to control the situation was sidelined when my wife gave birth to our child. Now she can no longer work because she has to be home with the baby. I watched weekly as our bank account shrunk. I felt the impending doom as the true consequences of my actions approached. I knew that I had to get off this shit. I did it before with heroin and I can do it again. 

So here we are in the present day. I HATE kratom. I hate myself for ever thinking I could take it successfully. I was so stupid. 

The biggest punch in the gut to all this is when I went back and added up how much money I spent on this. It makes me sick to my stomach to see it. This money that could have went to my family that I just flushed down the toilet for my own selfish desires.

I would quit CT like I did with heroin  but I’m working 7 days a week just to stay afloat and the withdrawals are too much. I can’t do my job accurately without sleep and a clear head. So I’ve decided to taper myself down. I followed the guide posted on this sub and am currently on day 3. I am determined to do this, I feel like I don’t have a choice. I will not bankrupt my family! 

I have taken the pure kratom extract liquid tincture for the last two years of my 3.5 year addiction  I was taking about 30ml a day so I cut that down to 18ml. I work 12 hour days and am usually awake for about 16 hours before bed. So I created a schedule and spread out my doses every 3.5 hours 6 times a day (taking my last dose before bed) for a total of 18ml.

 The first day wasn’t horrible but I think that’s mostly because my body was already saturated with the previous days full dose. 

The second day was a little rougher and I would begin to feel withdrawals 1.5 hours after taking my dose. (Aches and pains, stomach cramps etc) 

Today is day 3 and I feel less achy then I did the day before which is good (maybe I’m just getting used to the aches and not thinking about them as much ). I take a dose and set my alarm for the next one. I refuse to take my dose even a few minutes early. I do not want to cut corners on this because I feel that is a slippery slope. 

I am eager to be free from this substance. I have been a slave to it for over 3 years and it has dictated so much of what I do. To me the taper is just a means to an end. When this is all over I have so much more work to do to repair my family and myself. I thought I had learned my lesson in 2012 only to find out I didn’t know shit. 

I’m not sure why I wrote out all of this personal stuff. I guess I just wanted to get some things off my chest, and maybe someone else can relate. I really didn’t intend to write a novel. I’ve enjoyed lurking here the last week and reading all of the inspiring posts. I intend to come daily and I just want to say I appreciate everyone who contributes to this sub.

I am Sooooo glad I stuck with it. Would be 30 days but after one week I dosed. But that week CT was still progress and healing and contributed to my current state. I feel like I am near 100% of my better self. The me that existed prior to taking this crap.

It gets better -- thank you all,"I have suffered from chronic pain for over two years now from a serious injury where I broke my entire lower back. I was on an abhorrent amount of oxy for several months (I probably took 500 of them), and got really addicted to it, as my pain was unbearable once I tapered off. Kratom (at first, and for about 6 months) was a life saver. It helped with oxy withdrawals and pain management and I took kratom ""responsibly"" for that first year. I realized that I was pretty addicted to it, so I tapered off and was kratom-free for about 5 months. This whole time I was in college (my accident was summer after ffreshman year) and I never took any school off, prioritizing school over my own health (physical and mental). I was going so strong, but school got to be incredibly demanding. I snapped and started taking kratom every day again, knowing very well what I was getting myself into, considering my previous history with opiate and kratom addiction. I quickly became severely addicted, and after a month of daily use my back pain was intolerable without kratom. My daily doses skyrocketed (\~70+ gpd at its worst idek -- it was a lot), and intense withdrawals came shortly after. I felt trapped and ashamed, and the addiction consumed me; I never told anyone, even those closest to me, and the addiction consumed my life. I came clean to everyone 6 days ago, and I am so grateful that everyone was so supportive, dropping everything to help me get clean. The addiction had me convinced that if I disclosed the severity, everyone would leave me -- turn on me; that was not the case, and I want you all to know that people -- your loved ones, someone -- will  support you, and this addiction is nothing to be ashamed of. I quit CT that day, and I am a week clean today. The withdrawals were hell; the first three days were agonizing, and I was really sick -- bed ridden and in severe pain. I prevailed, though, and after those first few days, things started getting easier -- well, ""easier"" relative to the previous day. After a week I am still feeling shitty. The fatigue and back pain is really difficult, but I can sleep again; I can eat again; I feel like my whole disposition and outlook on life has changed; I finally look forward to the future and healing; and I know that each day will get easier, and soon I will physically feel ""normal"" again. Your posts and vulnerability is what motivated me to finally tell my loved ones, and you all gave me the courage to face these fucked up withdrawals. I thank you immensely for that, and I hope that this post can motivate some of you. It gets better; it actually does. You need to do whatever it takes to find the courage to set things into motion.

I would sell a lot of it (until the quarantine hit), teach all my peers of the magical substance aswell as the potential of abuse, draw art about it, make jokes about it, smoked it (once), I basically based a fraction of my personality about it. I just graduated this week and think I've been doing it daily for at least the past 100 days. Before then I would get a 250g bag, run through it in a month or so, and re-up after a week or two of taking a break. Though quarantine has basically ruined that cycle, because I'm able to just be inside all day long and be an endless kratom void. After quitting weed a month ago ive found my kratom useage has dropped by a big majority, going from 10-15 grams to <4 grams on a good day and <10 grams on a bad day. A bit about my situation, my parents have always been narcissistic dysfunctional addicted, blah blah etc. parents, I'm now forced to continue to live at home because I'm awful at school, my mom lost my birth certificate, and I would never take out a student loan and accrue debt because I do not have any faith that I can make it through college, nor do I have any idea what career I'd like to enter. I've had the mindset of needing to do at least one drug a day. I basically have done at least weed, kratom, or nicotine once every day for as long as I can remember. Now that I've quit weed and tobacco, I just have to knock out Kratom. My reason for concern all of the sudden is that I've been getting palpitations in my stomach artery and did a bunch of research scaring me, some kratom users report this but I haven't seen any other information about it other than that it could be an aneurysm? I doubt it since aneurysms only happen to older people but also you never know, since I have been doing kratom on and off for 3 ish years now. I know I have the ability to quit, but I feel like I'd just like to talk to some experienced people so that I can have some re-assurance, accountability, and advice I might not be aware of as of yet. All my previous times of quitting kratom have gone smoothly because I would have weed and nicotine to distract me but since I plan to be completetely sober, for the first time in a long time, I just want to get some help. I've been seeing a zoom therapist for a couple weeks now, should I bring it up to him and talk to him about this? I quit my job in preparation for just this, because kratom really gets me through my day at work and I know I will be completely dysfunctional or at least misreble at work for at least some time, which would be a huge factor in relapsing.",3,2

I don't know how those of you who have to work can do this, I applaud you all. I'm having a real hard time with no real responsibility, but I believe kratom made me into a workaholic so having no motivation to do anything is depressing in itself after working for 2 years+ straight on kratom.

Standing firm but it's hard today. As a neat little hack,  I remembered how I've always gotten a good hit of good brain chemistry from music. So I dialed up what I consider the most dopamine activating record in history,  Appetite For Destruction by GnR... and is helping! Lol.

Apparently I went into this, my first truly committed taper, thinking that as long as I kept my cuts modest after the initial dose massacre and was always doing the same amount or less than the day before, that I'd generally feel appreciatively better than the haggard parched shell of a woman who set down this path two weeks ago.

Well, not necessarily. Not every day anyway. Friday I sat down and cried because my toilet was clogged. Saturday I never got dressed or stepped out of the house because of a headache/discouragement combo.

The upside is - at this point I still know with my whole heart that quitting is the best choice for me. And I am slowly re-learning to endure hardships like a bathroom floor covered in dirty toilet water and a day of feeling alone and a bit hopeless and sick without reaching for the bag. And even though my life looks pretty pathetic overall right now, I'm proud of myself for coming this far.

I tried CT three months ago. My dog, who was my hero, my very best friend, and the reason I do everything suddenly passed away -  right after we'd moved by ourselves 3000 miles away from home for a better life. Her last week was $5k in vet bills. The day after she died I got a call saying the job I had lined up fell through. Then my new basement backed up with sewage - plumber said start saving for a $12k repair. I asked my new neighbor if he knows a plumber for a second opinion and his girlfriend got furious thinking I was trying to steal her man. 

I thought, you know what, fucking bring it on. I'm gonna CT and just dive all the way in to this poopy misery stew shitshow. I stocked up on supplies and hunkered down and envisioned myself - rising like a Phoenix from the ashes, armed with confidence from beating kratom and ready to face and conquer a new terrifying life all alone (too much Netflix???). But when the sleeplessness and ""Kratom Back""  hit on the second night - I knew my emotional state could not endure the rigors of CT and I abandoned the plan. I dove back into kratom.

When I was feeling so crummy this wknd, I wished I had the grit to just CT cuz this taper is getting old. But I'm so far in now, I want to see how it ends. 

CT adherents, I salute you. Taper sloggers, I salute you.  Lurkers, I salute you.

There's not much point to this ramble - I don't know any other kratom users so it's a comfort to be in the company of others who choose the difficult task of quitting  under their own difficult circumstances, cuz I think if one waits til everything is going great to quit then one might end up waiting forever to quit.",11,0

This bothers me. If I'm being effected by this drug to the point where it can potentially cause infertility that's scary. I've known it can effect me like this, and have really hated my thinning hair, but I'm hoping to use this as motivation to really cut this shit out for good. My doctor is booked up all month so I'm nervous and want to get my thyroid checked asap, but I guess for now I can take care of myself until I can get to the doc. I feel so weak and tired man.

Was on 45gpd for about 4-5 years and then jumped to gold extract caps 3/dose 3x/day for over a year.

My acutes ended around day 10 or 11 followed by a constant depression and anxiety. My sleep got better around day 15. It's still not normal, I still can't fall asleep unassisted (10mg melatonin and calm magnesium) and even then I'll wake up throughout the night, although I am able to fall back asleep every time I wake up which is nice. Even though it's not normal yet it's a night and day difference from what it was when I first quite. Definitely manageable.

My energy, strength, and motivation was non existent until about day 17 but is getting better each day and feel about 85% back to normal in those departments. Again, night and day difference from what it was and completely manageable. 

The constant depression ended around day 15 as well which I heavily attribute to the lack of sleep. Although the constant depression faded, it still does come in waves with good night's and bad nights. Tonight is one of the bad which is why I'm writing this. I'm at peace with having a bad night of depression but it's still really hard. I lost my girlfriend of 5 years to k so I'm incredibly lonely now. I quit my job so I could get rid of any excuse to keep supplying myself with k which was worth it and was nice but now I have no girlfriend and am completely broke so I can't go out and do anything with my friends which just makes the depression and loneliness worse. 

With all that being said, anyone struggling with what I've described, or anyone too scared to pull the trigger on quitting next they read posts like this, don't be. I'm depressed yes, but this is the only bad night I've had in about 4. Every day gets noticably better aside from the spaced out speed bumps. If I knew how much better I'd feel only 25 days sober, I would have quit years ago. I feel human again. I feel like me again. I feel life again. The good and the bad which I love. I'm not an emotionless shell anymore. 

Overall my quality of life has increased ten fold, and I'm not even a month in. With the damage I did to my body for 6 years straight, I couldn't be happier to have healed this much in only 25 days. I still have a ways to go. I still have a lot to re-learn about my emotions, healthy coping mechanisms, and healthy relationships with people, but I'm SOOOOOO much better.

I didn’t post yesterday because I just couldn’t seem to find the time. It was a good day. Just kind of chilled out with the family and enjoyed a day off.

Today is almost in the books as well. Slept in today which never happens. It was nice but also kind of felt like I missed a good part of the day. Haven’t done much today. A little reading, hanging with the kids and reflecting on myself. 

How should I live my life amongst those who are aware of the prize and are striving for it, whatever the prize might be to that person? What should I make my immediate goal? My long term one? How can I achieve happiness by serving others in a way which is unique to my abilities? All questions I hope to answer after a little work. 

What I hate most about my life without drugs is my anhedonia. It came about around 10 years ago. Before that, I felt I had a purpose and things to strive for. The past ten years, the best I could describe it, I have been just waiting to die. Basically I had just given up on life. Even in my clean time I had no spark.

Well, now that I believe I have identified the cause I think I can come out of this. It’s funny, I never really thought I was depressed these past 10 years but now I am realizing that that is what I have been living with. Now that I know that, I think I can come out of it. At least I know it’s worth trying.

To preface my next statement, I have never thought about committing suicide. 

I read somewhere recently that a study of people who failed a suicide attempt showed that the vast majority of them were very happy that they had not succeeded for they now knew that they wouldn’t miss the day that they would get better. 

That struck a chord with me. Especially since the last time I had a year and a half clean I started using again, in part, because I never got “better”. Maybe if I had just lived my life I would have been able to see that day. Instead I went back out. I will not make that mistake again. Indeed I will work to find what I am missing from my life and hope I see that day soon.

I hope you are all well today. Sorry for the the rant.

Godspeed",8,0

Well, day one being off of the kratom and the pain is completely gone. It's insane just how much this drug can fuck your life up, and then make you feel as if you STILL need to take more to mask the pain.

We get caught in the endless loop of staving off withdrawals and putting our health at risk. I was told that my bowels/intestines could have been perforated, that's how constipated I was, lol. Fucking hell.

If you're having kidney pain while on kratom, STOP. TAKING. THE KRATOM. The pain of these withdrawals is nothing compared to the severe pain I was in from kratom and it blows my mind how I refused to stop.

Also not dosing right away and using very small amounts of gaba every couple days to support the downshift. 

Today I didn’t dose until 1pm. Mind you, I was sleeping, but I did wake up around 11 and instead of dosing, I used the bathroom, and laid back down and was able to drift off.

I do have a bit of a headache but I’ll take it. I know I’m throwing my body for a loop so that’s understandable. 

My kidneys hurt from using this shit over the past 3 years and I’m hoping my kidneys will ultimately forgive me and go back to capacity. I’ve definitely noticed a change over the past year. I can’t take a full breath and my kidneys are not operating optimally. This makes me very sad and afraid of what I’ve done. I’m doing my best to make it right. 

Small steps for me. I would like to come down to about 5gpd for a week and then jump. I’ll have some gaba, mag, host defense, and cannabis to help. I don’t have access to anything like clonidine or Xanax and honestly I’m afraid to use them. I’d use a tramadol or two if I had them. 

Anyway, any other suggestions?",11,0

One of the main reasons I decided to quit was because my testosterone levels went down and my prolactin was sky high on kratom. I was noticing it was hard to lose weight and I was getting flabby. I’m a serious gym rat and my numbers were consistently stagnant or going down in the gym.

Now that Ive quit I am sooo much stronger in the gym. I’m getting random boners again and it’s easier to wake up in the morning. As men we need to recognize how important testosterone is for our mental and physical health. Taking kratom is just not good for you if you want to be lean and strong.",20,0

I’ve (24F) been using absurdly high doses of Kratom (~80 gpd), and this exact combination for at least half of the past 4 years and this has never happened before recently. I have gone through Xanax and alcohol WDs without seizing so I don’t think I’m prone to them, and the doctors said that they’re probably caused by alcohol WDs (I’m an alcoholic) combined with Kratom and made worse by stimulants, which makes no sense because I was drinking every time, as they did multiple scans (CT, mri, 24 hour eeg) and found ~fuck all~, except that I had a prolonged QT interval. So after being in the hospital for two days without Kratom/alcohol—and getting halfway/through the worst of WDs for both simultaneously (hell) and given Ativan— I decide to do the exact same combination/ doses my very first day out and everyday since because this is what I do. I have had extreme falls with hitting my head every time, lost my teeth, broken my nose, given myself black eyes/ bruises and bleeding all over my body and face, and bit through my tongue and lip multiple times (which is going to be permanently damaged if I bite through again I’m sure), and also, it’s fucking terrifying. And I’ve had two of them while alone, which I feel like is extremely dangerous, and don’t know how long they lasted (I was technically alone for the third one too but my family heard me fall, checked on me, and then I had a seizure for five minutes and didn’t know my name/ age/ the year/ president when asked by paramedics and couldn’t walk), and I am SO in debt with hospital and ambulance bills now (two each in the past few months), and I have no money so I can’t go back to the ER this time unless I’m ~dying~

I just realized that turned into a rant BUT I was just curious about if anyone here has experienced or quit due to having seizures? The reason I’ve been using Kratom for so long is to keep me off of harder opiates (I’m a recovering opiate addict), and to try to cut back on drinking (barely happening), but neither of those make me seize and this isn’t worth seizing. I plan to start a rapid taper today because CT isn’t really an option for me, as I am a ~baby~ (who quit oxy CT once and refuses to not taper ever again)

Also, every single time it’s happened has been after an extremely busy day/ I’m very exhausted, hadn’t eaten much, and at 3 am (which is when I’m about to eat dinner, and is probably because I take my last dose at 2 am and have the most in my system)?

But the truth is, I have been tapering off of xanax since I quit kratom, and you guys were not kidding, getting off of benzos is it's own beast... I used xanax for about 4 months to help with sleep and panic attacks, now in retrospect, I'm wishing I never touched the stuff.

But all water under the bridge, I am now 7 full days xanax free (I mean I was only taking 1/8th of a .5mg pill every 24 hours towards the end, that's basically nothing) and I am a full 60 days away from the green demon!

With that being said, I still have waves of intense anxiety, I think PAWS is going to be a thing for me for quite some time. But stepping back, it's easy to admit that it is far and away wildly better than it was while trying to get off of kratom. I can definitely safely say the worst of it is over for me. Zero cravings for kratom literally ever. Lol I still have like 300 dollars worth of kratom in a bag in my cabinet that I have been meaning to give to my friend (I hate wasting money, oh the irony right?), and I keep forgetting because I keep forgetting that it's in there. No more getting stressed and rushing to my stash, no more rushing home to take a dose scheduled literally down to the minute. No more pumping ridiculous amounts of money into a nightmare. 

I've put on about 30 lbs from my lightest kratom weight, and have hovered there for the last couple of months. Everyone around me when I was on kratom said I looked unhealthily too skinny, and truth be told, I was actually lighter than I was in middle school :( But not anymore, I look and feel great, my back pain flairs up, but no worse than it was when I was on kratom and my tolerance was so high I wasn't getting the effects of it anymore. My pupils are back to normal completely. I still have tinnitus, but I kind of always have, and it seems to be better than it was a few months ago, only pops up when I am really really stressed or anxiety-ridden.

I went into quitting kratom thinking bicycle riding was lame, and now it's a must in my day. I work out every morning too. I can literally feel my body releasing the endorphins into like my spine, like when I first started taking kratom, that little tingle, only much moreso, and way healthier too :)

I am a determined soul, I set my mind to quitting kratom, and with the help of my wife and you guys, I have finally rounded the ""big"" corner. For us addicts, the hardest part is learning to live life without using drugs as a crutch. For me, I can't see myself enjoying the ""high"" of a drug anymore because I know it's a lie. I spent so long being so miserable, I am NEVER going to forget what I went through for the last 5 or 6 months or so of withdrawing... Damn near ruined my life way more than I was ruining it by taking the kratom and being all sketchy and weird.

I have still been dealing with the struggle of the tragic loss of my father, and then my last living grandparent, and now my uncle recently passed, my mother's oldest brother, and a week later she went on a hike and fell and broke her wrist. These are all things that affect me tremendously and the old me would be drowning out all of it with massive doses of kratom. But I kind of take solace in the pain... I spent 6 years of my life numbing it all out with kratom, and now I finally get it. Life isn't just beautiful, it's awful too. And thanks to being off of kratom completely, I can actually experience both without convincing myself I need to take a powder to handle either.

I came off high dose oxy a couple of weeks ago, which was hell, and got on low dose kratom after the first week (4-8g/day but normally 4-5g).

On Friday I had 1.5g in the morning, than 0.75g at lunch, and that evening I took a temazepam and some ibuprofen and managed to sleep 6 hours.

On Saturday morning I had 2mg loperamide, 1g DLPA, 1tsp black seed oil, and 1g agmatine. Throughout the day, the withdrawals were very mild in comparison to oxy. I had aches in the arms, legs, and parts of the neck and head. Ibuprofen helped a bit. I was also sweaty, felt very hot, restless (constantly shaking the legs, moving around). But it was not much worse than how I would normally feel a few hours after dosing kratom. It was maybe 2-5% as bad as the oxy withdrawals were at that time.

In the evening I took another temazepam, which calmed the restlessness down quite a lot. It is much more effective in this way for mild kratom withdrawals than severe withdrawals. I tried to sleep but was unable to after 3 or 4 hours rolling around in bed sweaty. Felt really tired, and 90% of the way to sleep, but couldn't fall asleep. So I took 25mg codeine with ibuprofen. Still couldn't sleep, so took 0.75g kratom and managed to sleep 5 hours.

I had another 0.75g this morning, and plan to wait until bed time to have another 0.75g, and continue tapering from there until it's just the night time dose.",17,0

I've been looking at the posts here, since I've decided to quit kratom yesterday and let me tell you.
I've been taking kratom roughly since the beginning of January. I wasn't taking it everyday, but since I broke up with my girlfriend in April (couple of days before our 2 years aniversary) I started taking a lot more and everyday. I just felt like it was really helping me cope with it, I really wasn't that emotional at all about it. I though, well this went quite good honestly, I though I would be really sad and out of it, but not at all. I was very composed and focused on my work and other responsibilities and was very glad that the breakup didn't affect me almost at all. From there I really started taking kratom a lot more as I said and it became every day taking like 25 to 30g. So I decided to quit yesterday. The first couple of hours were quite fine, I could take it, we had a family barbeque and I started to feel the effects of withdrawal there. As I said, it was still all fine, I was just feeling kinda down, not laughing at all, just responding to the bare minimum that was required.
Then all the way from April, I started kinda thinking about my ex girlfriend. I started being a little sad about it. Started tearing up randomly, thinking about her and I never did that before. I really started feeling the breakup emotionally, though about all the times we were together, you know the drill. It was quite bad, I was really sad about it. Even now as I'm typing this, I'm tearing up about it and this hasn't happened yet at all, I thought I'm over it completely. Imo, kratom suppressed my emotions in this matter so much, that I couldn't really take it all in. In the evening it really hit me. The restless legs and whole body was just unbearable, I could stop it for a while and fall asleep for about an hour and then I woke up again being restless. And it was just this battle between restlessness and sleep the whole night. One second I was cold, another I was super hot and went from being covered in a blanket to being fully uncovered and trying to cool myself down. Like the restlessness is the worst of it for me. Other than that, I'm feeling super low, absolutely no motivation to do anything and I'm just really anxious knowing I'll have to go to work tomorow. I have no idea how I'm gonna get through that. Just to mention, I'm not using any sleep medication or any other medication going through this, just taking vitamins. My body aches hard, my eyes are tearing up for no reason and I've noticed I go urinate all the time. I'm not sure how I'm gonna get through the breakup part specifically, that's kinda tough. Also it just feels super bad. I even thought about texting her, but nah... We're over since April and I don't want to. I'm just too emotional about it now I think.
Yeah guys, this is absolutely terrible, hopefully I'll be able to get through this and I'll never underestimate the withdrawing power kratom has. This is absolutely horrible.",11,0

I've been lurking for a while and decided to make a post and share my progress and experience, maybe it will help someone, or motivate someone else to quit. 

Let me start by giving you guys an idea of how it started, where it went, and how it ended. I moved to Jacksonville Florida for a job about a year and a half ago and went to a smoke shop with my buddies and came across Kratom. It was white maneg da, I took maybe 3 grams and felt great! Well, when that bag ran out, I bought another... And another and another and another lol. This went on until I was taking about 30 GPD with no side effects or issues at all, plus in my mind it made me work harder and made me more productive, and that was all well and good. Well, after about 6 months I decided to move back to Alabama (my home state) and in Alabama, Kratom is illegal. In fact, if you get caught with it, it's a heroin charge here. That didn't stop me from bringing about half a kilo home. I ran thru that in no time and came off of it without much of an issue, aside from having no energy and a ripped stomach for a few days. I quit for maybe 7-10 days and then found out it's legal in Mississippi so I started making trips and stocking up. Fast forward 8 months later and I'm MURDERING Kratom. I'm talking about probably 50 GPD at the height of it, I even had strains I would mix for different reasons. I would take WMD, Super White, and OPMS during the day for work, probably at least 8-12 teaspoons depending on how rough work was that day then come home and take 3-4 more teaspoons of Red Maeng Da to ""relax"" when I got home. Well, one night I took my final 3 teaspoon dose of RMD to ""unwind"" and it made my kidneys hurt. After reading some people having that problem, I decided it best to quit. This was one month ago, almost to the day. Week one was the hardest, ZERO energy, no drive, muscle spasms, restless leg and some pretty bad diarrhea. Week 2 was a little better but I still had to push myself sooo hard just to get out of bed and go to work. During week 2 the kidney pain faded away after some antibiotics, and was completely gone for one full day, but this was replaced with lower back pain that persists slightly even now. I thought it was still kidney pain so I went to the ER and had a CAT scan, a blood analysis and a urinalysis only to find out I have a bulging disk from a work injury in Jacksonville that never hurt before because I was on Kratom all the time and couldn't feel pain lol. Week 3 was a bit better but it's during week 3 that I forced myself to exercise and lift weights and start eating more fruits and veggies. If any of you are in that BLEH phase where you have no energy and don't wanna get out of bed, what fixed it for me is pounding fruit and exercising regularly, specifically lifting weights helped me the most(takes a mountain of willpower because the last thing you wanna do with zero energy is exercise lol oh the irony) Now I've just finished up week 4 and I'm feeling infinitely better. I won't say good as new, because I still have PAWS symptoms where I wanna say ""well I'm all better now, no reason not to go get some Kratom"" but some of the posts I've read here have helped me not to do that. Believe it or not, I couldn't have made it without some of yalls posts, even tho I never commented. Just reading that others were battling the same enemy I was and succeeding helped ALOT. 
If anyone else out there is going thru it, I know it seems impossible and it is insanely difficult because of how easy it is to get, your life is better without it! So many times I snapped at my wife or daughter because I was so impatient due to the Kratom buzz. I want to thank you all for sharing your experiences because it truly did help me stay off of it. I made the conscious decision to quit alone, but I would've returned to it if I hadn't found the sub for sure. I love you guys, we are all going to make it!

A quick intro on what my kratom habit has been like over the years. After a years long opioid habit, I switched to kratom in 2014. I developed a nasty habit, consuming 30-40 grams of powder a day at the peak. At the beginning of 2018, I began a 2.5 month long taper, down to about 3-4 grams daily before jumping off March 24, 2018. The taper didn’t seem to help, as I had a hellish withdrawal, acutes that lasted about 10ish days but PAWS that lasted months. I had terrible problems with insomnia, depression, and stomach issues that finally lifted about 5 months later. 

I stayed off kratom for almost exactly a year before I hopped back on it spring 2019. I’m not sure why I went back other than I got curious about how good it would feel to try again, then staying on it out of fear of withdrawal.

Side note, I was a nicotine/tobacco user for almost 10 years. I quit in November of last year, been 6 months and super proud of it! But I feel this likely plays a role in low dopamine and some issues I have now.

After creeping up to 20 grams of extract daily over the last couple years, I quit April 17 of this year. I just felt like ripping the band aid off and went cold turkey. I had typical acute withdrawals that last about 5-6 days, then I slipped up and took some day 7. I was clean for 37 days before slipping up yesterday and binging on extract.

Today was very strange, and I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Every one of the previous days of my taper, I had steady withdrawal symptoms nagging at me until my scheduled dose. I believe I went into withdrawal last Sunday. And since then it's been consistently unpleasant, staying focused at work a struggle, etc.

But today! What the hell? I actually got up feeling pretty good. I began to forget I was in withdrawal until I remembered around noon with my usual looking forward on the clock to my dose. Soon I realized I actually felt better than ""normal"", as if I had dosed already. My reward center was nicely activated without my kratom. It was so nice for a change that I had zero craving for my dose at 3pm, albeit I was starting to feel slight unsettledness. But I felt so good I thought maybe I should delay my dose till I really feel like I needed it. I opted to take it just to stay on routine, and I did yoga. After the kratom kicked in, I really didn't feel much from it, presumably because my withdrawal had abated for some reason today. I'm going to see if I can eliminate or cut in half the 3am 3g dose tonight.

Anyway, I only have 1 previous quit, so not sure if this is a phenomenon to be expected in the taper process or whatever. Maybe God decided I needed to feel what it's like to be normal again, before the battle intensifies. I'll find out tomorrow and report back, but has anyone experienced these refreshing days during withdrawal?",4,0

I still feel like I’m walking with lead shoes on most days. Like my body is lacking a hormone or chemical that is needed for motivation or a sense of urgency. Every step takes effort. Once I get to the gym and get a pump going that feeling goes away almost like my body starts to produce whatever it was lacking. Then after the gym I fall back in to the lethargy. Is this my body wanting drugs? The gym giving me some sort of high? 

I feel so spacey and disconnected from the world. 

I noticed I was ignoring my gf and didn’t want to talk before the gym but on the way home I was talking and having a good conversation with her.

I've been taking Kratom for 1 year now.  I started taking about 4 or 6 grams per day but quickly escalated to 20 to 50-ish a day.  I wanted to quit a few months in but always failed.  I never went 24 hours without a dose until about 3 weeks ago.

I finally decided enough was enough so over the last weekend I went cold turkey.  It was a holiday in the US, so I had Saturday, Sunday, and Monday off work.  I made it about 80 hours and it was getting late on Monday night.  I was still withdrawing pretty bad and it was obvious I was not going to be able to get any sleep so I could work on Tuesday.  So I took 4 grams and was able to relax and sleep.

What I've been doing all week now is taking 3 grams at 8AM each day.  I start to feel sick (not very bad though) around 5PM and it's hard to fall asleep at night.  By the time I wake up in the morning I'm feeling like trash, although I notice it's getting a little better each morning.

Tomorrow (Sunday), I'm going to drop my dose from 3 grams per day @ 8AM to 2 grams and do that all week.  Depending on how it goes I might consider next Friday to be my last dose, but if I'm still pretty sick I'll cut down the dose next weekend to 1 gram per day for a week.

Does that sound reasonable?  

I'm honestly surprised with myself that I've been able to restrict my dose like this so far.  I'm an addict at heart so this kind of thing is usually unheard of for me.  I just keep thinking about how my life was before I started taking Kratom and I wanna go back.  I remember how I used to get up in the morning typically feeling great.  I'd have some coffee and all was good in my world.  I miss that so much.

The first run around withdrawals were completely over with in a week, with days 1-4 being the worst.

2 years later I was depressed after starting a new career and something in me convinced me to give K another shot. While it did cure my anxiety and sort of numbed out my depression, I had a toxic relationship with the plant after a few months. I loathed **needing** to take 3 doses per day to stave off withdrawals. I travel a lot for work and I **hated** packing kratom into little capsules just to make it thru a business trip. This last run I used kratom for almost exactly a year and a half, at around 30 gpd at that. Quitting was *much* more complicated this time. Not only was my physiology more adjusted towards kratom use, but the mental hold kratom had on me after a year and a half was much stronger. I never had any real anxiety about quitting the first time, but this time I had intense anxiety. The thought of quitting almost felt like losing a family member or a major part of my life. Eventually, I realized my relationship with kratom was totally toxic and despite the pain, I needed to end it.

I quit on May 14th and the first day went pretty well. I always do well with the acutes and just work out like a mad man but **here’s where I fucked up**:

I had a few major life events the weekend of the 14th and the following week. I guess you could say I quit at a bad time. I resolved to stay off of kratom at all costs but I hid my withdrawal from 30 gpd from all my family members and spouse. I fucked up because I began taking phenibut every other day to press on and actually be functional and get sleep. Although it did help me off of kratom, it became a whole new problem. I used phenibut every other day for about 10 days (6 times total). When I finally dropped the phenibut I was really in the shit. Now I was in phenibut rebound and kratom PAWs at the same time. I didn’t even sleep for three nights, this caused muscle twitches and intense anxiety. 

The weight of it all made me crack and I did relapse a couple times. The first time I used for 2 days at 5 gpd and this last week I used 4 days in a row at around 5-10 gpd. Now I am more than 24 hours clean from kratom and feeling great. I threw away my stash and have no wd symptoms to speak of. I guess I’m lucky in a way, but the long game is going to be tough. If anyone else out there is relapsing or struggling with relapse **please reach out to me** so I can talk you down. It truly isn’t worth it but I think some of us are just very slow learners.",7,0

I’ve been on and off Kratom for almost 2 years. At first it was just the shots that were very small doses before work for energy maybe once a day to smaller more concentrated stronger shot 4-5x a day. I didn’t think I was addicted until one weekend my sister was in an accident and we had to take off to Jackson to be with her and I didn’t have access to any Kratom. That first night I had night sweats, a terrible migraine, and I cried so much. My fiancé and I fought all weekend. It never occurred to me it was because of the kratom. Fast forward to almost 6 months later we went to the beach for my sisters wedding and I didn’t bring any kratom with me in hopes to kick the habit. I sweat, my legs and arms jerked all night, I was nauseas and on and off the toilet all day every day. And again.. me and my fiancé fought all weekend. It was like I was so emotionally sensitive.. after that it clicked that I was in fact addicted. I made it three days with out kratom that weekend and as soon as I got back home I bought a shot.. if I could go back a million times I would’ve never picked it back up. That was last September. Present day, Im now taking 4-5 shots a day equalling out to $16 a shot so you do the math. I have not been able to save money because of this and I’m now a nurse making good money and it’s keeping me from having the things I want. I no longer take it for pleasure but just so I won’t feel like shit.

My fiancé knows I take it occasionally but doesn’t know the extent of it.. I don’t want to tell him..

I didn't plan to stop when I did but I unfortunately (or fortunately) got food poisoning and couldn't keep anything down for 24 hours. Once I started feeling a bit better from that I realized I'm already 24 hours in, so I'm riding it out. I've been wanting to quit for a while but didn't think I was strong enough to do it considering how busy I am with work and kids. But here I am.

Symptoms include pretty extreme lathergy, RLS, and sneezing. I'm sure the lathergy has something to do with a lack of restful sleep. It's honestly not been as bad as I thought, just as many other say, you can do it.

 I took Hylands restful legs last night for the first time and I HIGHLY suggest incorporating that in your quitting protocol. I also use a workout supplement (vitamin/mineral/herb pack) called Animal Stak. Its helped me tremendously. Other things that helped me were daily hot showers followed by as many seconds as I can stand of cold water. Sucks in the moment but I end up feeling great for a while afterwards.

Another mental crutch for me was keeping a hydrocodone in my pocket the first 2 days. It was nice knowing if it ever got completely agonizing I had a way to mitigate it. I know this method won't work for many people and I don't necessarily suggest it, but it was a security blanket for me.

I went to the gym for the last 2 days and despite telling myself I'm crazy for attempting it while sitting in the parking lot I actually had really productive lifting sessions. This has been the #1 helper on my detox. I'm a former gym rat and I feel a better mind muscle connection and am getting sick pumps compared to when I used kratom. Natural endorphins are so great.

For the first 3 months it was quite helpful. But after that I really noticed I began feeling really really OLD. My knees started to fail me. Getting up and down was painful especially when I had less Kratom in me for working my job.

I quit nearly cold Turkey 4 days ago.

My brain is trying to recreate the recipe for dopeamine that I had stolen from it long ago when I discovered adderall kratom and tianeptine. 

I have some hopes that after my 30 days, things will improve. But man, this is no joke. Twilight zone stuff. 

I feel heavy. Mainly heavy legs and a flatlined mood. Time drags still and I do anything I can to forget about the time while I’m at work and just tell myself I’ll get through today just like I did the day before and the day before that. 

It’s not a permanent solution. It can’t be. That would be a horrible life. That’s what I’m holding onto. This isn’t permanent. This time next year, you’ll be smiling on the beach with friends with absolutely no cravings and fully ripped again. This is just a dark part of your twenties that you and your wife will look back on when the kids are running round with their high school friends. 

Ugh. Well...

Onward to day 21

Yesterday I posted about how I felt my motivation and ambition was returning. It felt great but may have been a bit premature to say those things. Was I just manic yesterday or was it a glimpse of what’s to come? I’ve never been bipolar or anything and it did feel exactly like I used to feel before my addictions so hopefully it will come back.

Just want to be realistic here. I don’t feel bad today by any means. Just not as focused. Maybe because it’s Friday and nobody wants to work on Fridays? I did sleep great last night and got in a good workout before work so it’s not all bad. Just kind of hoped I would keep that momentum.

I’m confident that I will heal and get my old self back. It just kind of sucks to have had that experience yesterday and it be mostly gone today. I feel like I had the Limitless pill yesterday and I ran out today lol.

Anyway, we will all experience good days and bad days. That’s just a part of life. I am still very optimistic and I’m glad I’ve been clean from K for two weeks!

Whatever your goal is today go crush that shit! You can have it if you want it.

I am getting ready to quit. Yea, again. I still don’t have a plan for pain relief other than ibuprofen and physical therapy, but I don’t want to use my pain as an excuse to use anymore. 
I am prepared for freezing/sweating, shivering, yawning and leaky eyes. I am not prepared for the giant emotional rift that is going to present itself. If I’m late with a dose, it creeps in. I get sad and tearful. Quitting will bring back the beast on difficult mode. 

I am on meds for depression and have been for decades. I think Kratom kept me comfortably numb and now I am back to staring into the void.

789,2021-06-04 13:26:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nsajdv/finally_decided_to_quite/,Finally Decided to Quite,"I got into Kratom 3 years ago as a means to get through a temporary job assignment on top of my full time job. Initially just took a couple days a week, but a couple months or so in I must've rationalized ""I can do this every day.""

I have tried to keep it around 15g, but went through brief periods where I hit 20-24grams.

I quite pretty easily for a month or so around this past New Years, and decided to pick it back up for occasional use...but it's hard to avoid the daily approach with kratom lol

I realized that all the good feelings and benefits had diminished considerably, and my use was really one to avoid the withdrawals that getting off it would entail. Realizing that is the basis of my current motivation to leave it completely behind.

As I said my prior quit was fairly easy. I was using delta 8 which I had discovered around Christmas to help with sleep. On my first or second night, I used a supplement that had phenibut in it, and boy did it work for withdrawals, but I only used that one night because of all the horror stories of that substance's withdrawal. Didn't want to get close to dependence on that. But I believe that one night really gave me a restless leg up. The rest of the week was just sinus and sneezing and low energy.

Oh, that first quit was a cold turkey one.

Ive decided to approach this time with tapering. Night 7 and I'm down to a 6 gram dose mid afternoon and a 3 gram dose at 3am when I usually wake up restless.

Taking it slow. I'll reduce by .5 gram per week see how that goes. Taking mega doses of vitamin C, a magnesium supplement, and still utilizing delta 8 at night to get me to bed.

Work is difficult to a degree but nowhere debilitating. I'm doing daily yoga which helps to release GABA and stimulate my natural opioid system. Yoga works! I've not done enough study but I have a pet theory. Science definitely has proven that the body is flushed with GABA after a yoga session, similar to levels you get from drinking a couple beers. But I also think the pain of stretching results in a similar opioid release runners get with the runner's high.

I loved this herb for about 2 years, but it's now beyond time to say goodbye. Definitely has promise for hard drug users to help get off them, but not for recreational use. I was lulled in by the fact it's a mild opiate, but I also read too much ""it's a coffee cousin, wd is just a notch above quitting coffee."" That's just not true. We all probably know that here.

Bye bye Kratom. Give me a few more months, and more yoga and meditation and love, and I'll have hardly known yee! I probably won't forget how incredible you felt that first time, but I don't need the mini mr. brownstone and all the slavery you bring.",1,0

First off I'd like to say that I'm a recovered alcoholic for over 4 years now. However after two car accidents and 4 surgeries I'd been through a lot.  I'd taken scripts and while they worked my addictive personality made it hard to quit those as well. I found kratom April of 2020. Final surgery was July of 2020 but I loved kratom. I'd say that the pain was gone by this past September but my kratom use wasn't. My doctor/surgeon was fine with me taking it. Thought I'd add that in there. There were times that I took too much and experienced some pretty high anxiety. My daily kratom intake eventually became a minimum 3 to 4 times a day 3g to 5g per dosage. It was the only way to get/keep me going. Earlier this year I noticed the anxiety getting worse, then the full blown panic attacks kicked in. I don't like saying any of this because I believe kratom was truly helping me. Fast forward to May 11th (24 days ago) and I had the worse panic attack of my life. I was taken away by ambulance and was in a total 2 hour catatonic state. Scariest shit of my life. I got home somehow without being committed and tossed everything out. Next 4 days were hell. Went back to the ER 4 days later and am in the middle of an IOP/PHP learning coping skills on anxiety and panic attacks. I've never had it this bad when quitting drinking from chronic alcoholism for almost 20 years. I'm 3 weeks into therapy, I've lost about 25lbs (which is alright for a heavier guy like me I guess)... I just started taking Ensure today. It's just mind-blowing to me the level's of anxiety, lack of appetite and sleep. I'm fully aware of the meds I'm taking. My psychiatrist put me on 30mg of diazepam a day and it helps. It's just baffling to me the lack of almost anything I want to do after feeling alright days 5-15.... I feel like I'm regressing. It's crazy. I don't know if it's a fear of having some panic attack again or what. My support system is huge. But nobody knows about kratom, including most doctors. Thanks for ANY ADVICE!!!!!",2,0

I'm conflicted because while I do recognize that I was smoking way too much before and had a lot of negative symptoms from it, it's so innocent and (relatively) safe that it's hard for me to rationalize my way out of using it when the cravings come.

So I have used kratom for about 2 months, on daily basis with the exception of stopping during weekends. After about 1 and half months I started experiencing bad stomach pains from the kratom itself. So I attributed that to the plant matter which could not be effectively dissolved by my GI tract. I switched to strained tea and things turned out to be better. For a while. The issue had returned, although this time It was like burning sensation in my lower abdomen, almost near intestines, which after a while escalated to my stomach and chest too. Felt like someone dumped hot liquid lava in to my stomach. This time it was not associated with kratom intake, but rather it was happening after my meal, usually it's like 2 hour mark after eating last meal and the pain might last anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours (baking soda seemed to help). These pains sometimes were better, sometimes worse. Sometimes I could eat whole pizza and I was ok, other times I ate cottage cheese and suffered horribly. Sometimes the pain was so bad I was lying in my bed in fetal position and waiting it out. The thing is, I continue to have these pains after eating even though I stopped taking kratom about 2 weeks ago. I went to gastroscopy , they put camera through my mouth to my stomach. Doctor said I have to wait for the results of the sample they collected, however he told me that just by visual inspection using the camera my GI tract looks completely fine and healthy. Therefore I'm back to square one, not knowing what is going on with my body . What I will say though, I can tolerate vegetables, fruits and low fatty food better.

Today I woke up quite tired as I went to bed at 2:00AM. After having a coffee (it's not making me sick anymore if I eat first but will try not to drink more than 2 cups a day - we have a high quality espresso at home so I'm not worried about negative health impact) I went through new posts on this forum and proceeded with wim hof breathing. It quickly made my (mild) anxiety go away. After doing 50 sit ups just to warm up my body a little, I jumped into the shower. I started with warm water, cooled it down after few seconds until I reached maximum cold water. Maybe I should mention it is quite freezing where I live. However...once I started to pour it all over me, my breath went completely off and I started gasping for air despite my attempt to keep it calm. I changed my strategy and started with external parts of my body first, then continued with belly, chest and head so I was finally able to have a full body shower for 10 seconds. Personally I prefer slow immersing into a cold river/ lake so I can have more control over my body but quite sure I'll get used to it. Still, even that brief cold shower improved my thermoregulation, I'm still a bit cold but now it involves my palms and feet only. I went for a forest walk to keep my fragile wellbeing going. Now I'm pretty exhausted for some reason and feeling like I have a mild cold, sore throat included, but my mood is stable. Wierd, is that the day 1 CT flashback or did I catch something? But I'm definitely still ready for children to arrive for the weekend and even looking forward to it (I have just one kid who's mostly staying with me but my boyfriend has 3 and sees them every other weekend). 


P.S.: I still have quite severe diarrhea, it feels like it will become integral part of my life forever 🤦‍♀️. Also, my mental condition is far far from being happy but just having some peace of mind helps...and it IS getting better. Nausea still there but sometimes my meal even tastes good!

For some, it's a day of joy, restful sleep, an energized mind and body and newly found desire to enjoy the weekend. 

For others, it's a day in the trenches. A night if restlessness, insomnia, night sweats, anxiety, a feeling of loneliness and impending doom. (I know, I've been there)

For those further along in their process, lets not forget where we came from. Let's continue to show empathy and compassion for those just starting there journey. For me, this group was a lifeline to hope, encouragement and a daily tool to get me through another day. We have what others desperately want. A fresh start @ life with no mind or mood altering substances to get us through it. Let's continue to be a beacon of hope for them to show life without sludge is possible, attainable and oh so worth it 👌

For those of you who are in the heart of their quit, I want you to keep holding on! In moments of despair, reflect on your past and remind yourself why you decided to kick this 💩.  Dig down really deep and fight for another day clean. Each day clean is a day won! Each day won is a day closer to that feeling of freedom. Freedom from the grips of this trash that has set out to bring you down and keep you down. Today is YOUR day to fight back, not to give in and look that SOB in the face and say ""NOT TODAY!"" Today I will win!! 💪

Today I will reach out to those who have been here, those who support me and those who want to see me clean and living a happy productive life and absorb all the love and encouragement I can to combat the noise. The thoughts in our head are lies, theirs no such thing as relief through the sludge. It's a trick to get you to slip so it can drag u back in. Today I want you to take the road of uncomfortableness because this roads end is a joyous feeling. The other road of a quick fix is a road of fear, depression, anxiety and feeling of being trapped. 

If your ready to stop ✋ please stop. Do it for you! You'll be surprised to see how courageous you can be and how strong  you are when it comes to fighting for something you want. The feelings you feel in the beginning are only temporary but the feelings you feel after are priceless. You can do it, I believe in you!

If your alone in this journey and have no one in your corner, just know you have US! We are here, we've been there, we hear you, we see you, we want what you want, we have what you want, we are one! Sending everyone new and old good vibes and wishing you all a life of happiness! ❤",36,0

Quick back story. i started off 2019 with capsules 4-8 a night for a few months. started mixing powder in april 2019. pretty quickly i was off to the races taking enough to throw up basically everyday. i Went from 4g once or twice a day to 4-5gs 4-6 times a day over the summer and kept it there until november 2020 when I started throwing up blood. this was possibly from mixing with alcohol. 

ive been sick of this stuff for a while. I had a 2020 new years resolution to quit.

I cut my self back from 25g a day to 6g a day and it was rough but i avoid the muscular/skeletal withdrawals with benzos. after this the physical NEED for it was through the roof comapred to before. i really relied on those 6 grams. I slowly got back up to 8-10 a day for about 6 months.

It was finally time to quit so i started tapering down. went from 8 to 6gpd for a while and got tired of the slow taper and went for an intense taper. 6 to 3 on day 1. Then to 3 the next day. Day 3 took 2 grams. Day 4 1.5 and Day 5 stopped mixing shots and taking 1 .5g capsule twice a day for 6 days. Last dose friday may 29th.

It started with being insanely tired. I think i slept more than 12 hours a day for the first 3. The physical withdrawal symptoms through out the last 2.5 weeks have been HORRIBLE. Nerve pains, Restless legs to the point of being swolen and causing cramps all in my legs. Joint pains ive never had before. and I emphasize the leg cramping. Ive had to stop driving as of over 2 week in because the pains are seemingly getting worse. Ive been taking Gabepentin and it hardly helps expect to knock me out at night. Also ive never sneezed like this before in my life. Seems like im releasing a lot of mucus. Little to no pooping problems. Constipation if any thing which seems to be contrary to the norm.

Mental withdrawls have been getting worse as the physical slightly improves. But the damn pain in hamstring and up into the under side of my butt is preventing me from driving or getting out to exercise.

Ive had no mental desire to use kratom though thats how sick of it my body is. I just want to be back to normal.

Any advice on being overly sensative during sex after quitting? ive been quite premature lol",3,0
807,2021-06-03 20:51:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nrsonc/tired_and_sick_help/,Tired and SICK!!! Help!,"Over the span of 3 years, I’ve went from a couple tablets (which amounts to about a gram) a day, to twice a day, up to 5 times a day, and just last week I was up to 5-6grams 6/7 times per day.  Basically whenever I felt the buzzing, tightness, anxiety, restlessness, soreness, or any feeling whatsoever creeping on... which by last week was about every 3 hours. So I spend my days doing whatever it is that’s on my list and making sure that I have my every few hours dose available so as to not feel shitty. I hate it. I’m sure I don’t have to go into much depth about how it is destroying my peace of mind and my freedom. And my health. 

I wake up every morning feeling like complete shit because I haven’t had a dose in 6 hours. And yeah that’s all the sleep I’ll get because my body will wake up and demand the stuff. I’m no stranger to this feeling. I kicked a heroin turned Methadone habit in 2010. I walked off cold turkey because I was ready. And I did the damn thing. I made the decision.

Fast forward to late 2018 and I needed something “natural” to ease my hip pain. I’m what you would consider “crunchy” and I live a toxin free lifestyle, eat all organic, practice holistic living, and I figured what could be wrong with something like this herbal plant based medicine. Boy was I wrong. 

Anyway, I’ve gotten to the decision making point but it took me a couple years to get here. I’ve been reading everything here and have really found solace and strength from all you badass quitters. It just so happens that my dog has a whole script of gaba that they didn’t need. 

So yesterday instead of 6/7 doses of 6 grams every 3 hours, I was able to comfortably take 4 grams only 3 times yesterday with the help of only 150mg gaba. Instead of taking my 2nd dose of K, I took the gaba and was smooth sailing for a few hours and then took a nap. I took my 2nd dose of K around the time I would’ve normally have already consumed my 3rd or 4th dose of K. And I felt fine besides a wave of exhaustion and a little brain fuzz. Other than that, I was great! 

I did the same thing today. I do have a bit of a headache but I’ll take it. Normally by right now (8pm) I would have already consumed at least 20ish grams (with a couple doses to go before bed) but I’ve just taken my 3rd dose and I’m at about 15 grams with having taken 150g gaba around 1pm. 

It’s like I’ve cut the usage in half two days in a row and all I feel is a little restlessness and and a dull “sore” headache. I assume this is fine. I don’t want to put myself in shock but I just don’t want to take it anymore!!!! I also know that gaba withdrawal can be worse so I want to see how I do without it the next couple days. I’m worried about it because my job requires me to be on point and if I am not, I will have to take something to get me through until I’m not working. Another issue is that I work “on call” so I can’t really plan it out the way I would be able to with a 9-5 type of job if that makes sense. I’m also a parent and have a big role in an important field/profession beyond my career. 

I can’t do this anymore. Ive become a bitter shell of a person. I’ve become so paranoid and once I lay down at night (3am 😩) I think of every way I am destroying my health and how I’m just going to die from it. It’s given me a medical anxiety type of hypochondriac thing and I cry my eyes dry thinking about death. I didn’t know it could lead to such mental and spiritual torture.

Anyway, any suggestions? I’ve just been lurking and cheering you all on and admiring the overall badassery of the group in general. Please give me your best words of wisdom and encouragement. All the advice and detail you have would be be so helpful.

I’ve been posting an update on here every day since day six I think. It has been helpful for me just to put out there how I am doing since I have kept my family in the dark. Plus, nobody I am close with in my life has ever been an addict so they wouldn’t understand. 

Anyway, how am I feeling on day 13? Well, pretty good. The thing I have noticed most is that my ambition and motivation are coming back. Like my brain is starting to work again. You see, I have always been productive, motivated and ambitious when not on drugs. Lots of accolades in college, great job right after college and then I started a business in an industry I had no business being in with my business partner. You probably wouldn’t believe an addict like me could be in the type of socioeconomic situation that I am in. Evidentially, I am a damn good business man. In my moments of clarity over the past 12 years I have accomplished so much. 

Now, since yesterday, I have been exploring ways to grow my business much faster than it has been organically. This is a familiar feeling for me although I haven’t felt this way since the short time I had clean at the end of 2019. I am really glad that the cloud is lifting and I am starting to be my old self again. How could I have been so content all that time basically doing nothing while on Kratom? What was I running away from? This is something I will be working with my therapist on because obviously I don’t have that answer.

What I want to do is to help improve the lives of those around me. My clients and my employees need a better leader so I’m on my way.

No real WD symptoms today. Slept okay last night. Excited for tomorrow.

I have a long way to go but today has been a good day. I will not use today. 

Whatever your goal is today go crush it! You got this!

If I don't take it in the morning my eyes start closing and my body feels like I weigh a million pounds by 12 o'clock. I have read that coffee makes things worse but I can't imagine quitting both at once! I am dependent on caffeine as is and I was hoping it would be the only thing to help get through my day.

I mean, when I tell you I don’t think one microscopic piece of dopeamine was released in my brain for the past two days, I’m serious. It was DARK. I made journal entries to somehow try to explain how I felt. 

Don’t get me wrong,, I’m not totally out of the grey. I was just so in the dark that the littlest bit of light seems like a lot and that’s what I’m experiencing today. A tiny bit of okay. 

Some lethargy. Some “whatever just another day” thoughts. But not total despair.

Slow tapers just have not worked. They are too hard for me to stick with. Also i need to be off of this stuff soon so when we can all travel again I can take my son places.

I have pramipexole (as a substitute for gabapentin which my doctor wanted me to try first). Neither of these work with the night time wake ups.

I'm on fourth day quitting and fast tapering by stretching the time between doses. Yesterday I was taking 9 grams (at 3 am, 2 pm and three times 1 g within few hours before bed time about from 8 pm close to midnight). After the second dose got the idea to buy alcohol and drink if it would help. After two hours of drinking horrible withdrawals occurred at about 5 pm but I continued drinking. Then withdrawals stopped almost completely.

Today I woke up at 6:30 am, took one g at some point in the morning and another at 2 pm. I'm having mild hangover but no urge to dose nor kratom withdrawals.. Also, I slept til morning, didn't woke at night to RLS or need to take some.

Is hangover masking withdrawals and why I have no need to dose (actually whole thought of taking kratom is disgusting)? 
When I took those 1 g doses, then I was having some withdrawals for half to one hour, so better be without. Also, my old self came back, am laughing and having totally different mindset than what I was on k.

Anyone else having the same experience?

Edit: It's 5:23 pm now, am european.

Edit 2: Restless Body, yawning and tears flowing started moment ago when going to bed. Really weird that this day was easy. I don't recommend taking alcohol anyway. Like another post tells, it might even add usage and/or make WDs much worse. 

Restlessness is in the back, behind the chest. This sucks, hopefully 1 g keeps me sleep whole night.
PS. 3 x 1 g whole day without pain, comparing 9 g yesterday. If this stretching time between doses method really works this effectively, can't but recommend to test this instead of CT or long tapering. The amount of suffering per day have to happen but the amount is up to you! And doses should be at threshold level or lower to prevent good feeling and redosing.",3,1

Just came to a realization. About 9 months ago I developed guttate psoriasis quite suddenly and severely all over my body. I have psoriatic arthritis, diagnosed about 12 years ago, but have never had this problem. I've only had plaque psoriasis in a few places, but nothing severe. 

I had been taking kratom daily for about 3 months at that point for pain and coming off of opioid medication, but I have taken it daily in the past a few years ago and never had that issue. Since developing it all over my body, nothing I've tried medication-wise (biologic, oral steroids and steroid cream) has helped, but I just realized that the only thing that I haven't changed is the kratom.

I'm on a taper now because my hair is falling out too and I think it's also causing bad mood issues for me, but I'm wondering if the kratom could be related at all to the sudden appearance of this psoriasis that I've never had before?

A couple nights ago almost an hour battle of chest pain which was probably bad indigestion ,near he end sent me into a full blown panic attack. I literally thought I was having a heart attack. Thing is only my chest hurt and nothing else. So I had finally got up to walk around and suddenly I just felt this immense doom. I had never felt that in my life before, so you can imagine I thought I was going to keel over. But I just gave a few deep breaths and noticed the pain went away. 

Well next day I was perfectly fine but, the day after I had another mini episode. And same with this morning but nowhere near as bad. I feel like I have noticed something though. Everytime I let a lot of gas out or drop a load it seems to go away for awhile. So maybe I juat have GI issues. Every once in awhile I will just
feel these jolts of quick pain on any part of my chest. Its so annoying.

I do have a question. So when I was dosing I'd dose every morning and every night.

I’m coming off of a 2-4 shot a day, plus 20-30 gpd of powder, so I’d imagine a lot of you know how I’m feeling right about now. This will be my second attempt at quitting, and I truly feel like this will be my last. It took me hitting my own personal rock bottom to shift my perspective, my car lease is up in 5 days and instead of saving money for another car like a normal person would do, I blew all of my money on K. And the most fucked up part about it? I knew this is exactly what was going to happen if I continued my use, but I did not care. All I cared about was going to the smoke shop and getting my shots for the day, blowing money like I was a millionaire. Now here I am, day one, no car, not a dollar to my name, ready to start fresh. Sometimes you need that slap in the face from life in order to shift your perspective, we’re all human, we’re going to make bad choices and that’s okay, we learn from those mistakes and get better.

My original dose up until 15 days ago was 1.5 Tsp 4 to 6 times per day Every 3 to 4 hours. 15 days ago I went from 1.5Tsp to 1Tsp and continue to take it at my regular times througout the day. The first 3 days or so I was somewhat sensitive to temperature but nothing that wasnt unbearable. Today on day 15, 2 weeks after cutting my doses by 1/3 I cut my doses from 1Tsp to .75Tsp taking it the same times of day I am use to. So far today I haven't noticed anything uncomfortable about it. I plan to stay on the. 75Tsp every 3 to 4 hours for no more than 2 more weeks. After that I will either cut my dose down to 1/2Tsp every 3 to 4 hours or every 6 to 7 hours (3 times per day instead of 5 to 6 times). I want to try to taper down as comfortably as possible as not to affect my work. The only think I am worried about is once I cut completely off I will get restless legs while trying to sleep like I got when I went cold turkey off of opiates. For 2 week while being completely clean before Kratom I got maybe 16 to 19 hours in 2 weeks of sleep due to restless legs spasming right before I would fall asleep. If anyone has any suggestions as to what I could do about restless legs please let me know. My advice to people tapering down or cutting off is to stay active. After work I go work out then I rest for a hour or 2 eat dinner go for a walk get fresh air and then get ready for bed. That way you mind will be preoccupied and wont think about the affects you might be feeling while quitting or tapering down.",1,0

No one else needs to deal with this shit. They don’t need to go through the WD. They don’t need the false sense of happiness and security. They don’t deserve the roller coaster ride of emptiness that seemingly doesn’t end for people.

I ordered the kratom that I normally get from the same vendor I have had for years and its obvious something is different. Either its now a lot weaker (a lot) weaker or there are different chemical components to it. No idea but on my normal dose I am in massive withdrawals. I already take a big dose so I am not doubling it or more to make up for it. 

Anyway this sucks. I have a clonodine script from a failed attempt to quit and I filled it. It helps a lot but it wears off really fast. It says to take the two little tabs 3 times daily and it only helps for a couple hours. What did everyone else take?

I am at the point that I am so sick of this I know I just need to quit. If I’m going to do withdrawals now I might as well just stop. Anything good i feel from kratom at this point anyway is just relief of withdrawal symptoms. 

I am scared of PAWS. How long does it normally last? What can help with PAWS? I see lots of supplements for accute withdrawals but dont see anything for long term.

It was at first a total game changer and within a few months, I was dosing 2-3 grams at 5x a day. That of course escalated and soon enough I was hitting 45-50-65- even 100 grams per day. So after thousands of dollars, a breakup of 6.5 years (only partially related to kratom), and a steady decline in mental health I met with a drug treatment specialist. They prescribed me suboxone. Told me to wait till symptoms get bad enough and to then to start suboxone.  I waited three days! My symptoms were rough but I was honestly doing fine. On day 2 I was super agitated and had a racing heart. But I didn't even get close to meeting the ""bad withdrawals"" I was expecting based on my use history and previous withdrawal experiences. This also worked out because it was over memorial day weekend and I quit Thursday mid-day so by the end of Friday I was done with work and heavier withdrawal symptoms had set in. By Sunday I was on the up and by Tuesday I was working out and being social again.

SO... to those of you who see a lot of rough experiences shared here and feel that that's terrifying, know that some of us might be lucky like I was. The withdrawals might not be so bad.  I DID NOT end up taking the suboxone. I just realized I didn't need it. I think for me personally it gave me a sense of security knowing that I had a ""safety net"", helped me get through the acute stage. I knew that if I was starting to really lose it I could give myself something. There are options out there if you have an extreme fear of withdrawals like I did.  I also tried tapering and I just wasn't able to do it. What I've read about suboxone gave me a lot of pause because it is also very addictive but I was done not making progress on quitting and I was ready to work through the process whatever it looked like. I had a really candid conversation with the drug treatment doctor and that was helpful. He ran through all the scenarios that I might experience and not needing the suboxone was one of them.  I have been struggling with getting off kratom for two-plus years. I gave up trying to do it on my own and that's why I sought treatment. It was really helpful talking to the doctor about my journey with mental health and addiction because it's been a lifelong struggle. He was very understanding and said, ""if you stay committed we can figure this out."" I then had a helpline I could call, a variety of options for how to get through it and I realize now I just needed that type of support.

Anyway, working out does help a lot. My anxiety actually went way down.  I was constantly rebounding between doses of 13-16 a day of about 3-4 grams sometimes more so my anxiety was higher last week. Find your safety net if that's something that sounds appealing to you! Good luck yall. I'll check back in if yall want updates. You can do it. I've been lurking on this sub for like two years lmao.

Used to be hooked on prescription opiates, but I will literally fuck up my life (I have multiple times) even just smoking weed everyday. I had 6 months sober before COVID and was feeling good, but I let myself slip after a traumatic event (when I should have just called my sponsor). Anyway, of course, for more than a year after that I didn’t spend more than 3 hours sober. ~30 gpd kratom helped me hit my bottom, and for that I am grateful. But damn if it isn’t so hard for me to stop smoking weed, especially during WDs. I smoke so much that it completely fucks my appetite, I can barely eat unless I’ve had a pretty large amount of weed beforehand. I’m so ready to be free again, but the insomnia, anxiety and sometimes nausea I get from quitting weed was brutal on top of kratom WDs. I went to my family’s house for the summer, telling them (without too much detail) that I relapsed and needed to be somewhere safe. I am so damn blessed to have a family that will do that for me despite all the horrible stuff I put them through over the years with my addiction. Seeing them, and seeing my incredible sponsor here gave me the push I needed. Yesterday/last night, I sucked it up, tossed my wax pen, and began the journey.

I've been using Kratom on and off for about a year or two now.   
I've struggled with depression for years, and it seemed to take off the edge on some of those days.   
I prefer it a lot over something like beer.  
I quit once before, and I was off of it for about two months. That was a year ago.  
Then one day I had a difficult day and started again. It helped for the time being.  
This month I've been using more than usually, and it amounts to 5 grams a day, solid. Maybe 6.   
I'm starting to be dependent, and it feels like Kratom might be more potentially dangerous than what I thought. I made deals with myself to only go to the smartshop for twice a month, but I've been breaking that promise. I think that is a pretty good indication that something isn't right. Even though my use is not wildly out of control, something about it feels wrong, like I am at this point not gaining anything and just am making myself more dependent. The Kratom days itself are still really nice tho... I still love the effects. Not to sound dramatic, but I feel this shadow looming over me from behind me, like it wants to get me. I also wake up some days with light muscle aches.   


So from today on I want to quit. I \*just\* had the thought of buying some more as a ""last time"" but luckily the shops are closed right now. I want to do this. It sucks not being able to trust yourself.   
Do you guys have any tips? I want to go cold turkey. Can you give me an indication of the withdrawals, even though it varies wildly from person to person?  
Any tips on keeping my promises to myself?  
Addiction is such a sneaky thing.

PS - I fell asleep around 1am last night and stayed sleeping. Super thrilled for that. Magnesium really is helping. Although at night when laying down - my stomach feels like crap. That keeps me up more than RLS. Haven’t seen many complain about this - I am certain it is a symptom of WD though.

I started taking kratom again back in early December 2020 after getting off suboxone CT which I had been on for 6 years.  The withdrawals were horrible so I turned to kratom after less than 3 months and I wish I had given myself more time without it. I started taking kratom the second I woke up every morning and it was affecting my life so negatively. All my spending money went to kratom and my other medications weren’t working. However I am so glad I am off even though I made mistakes in the past week. Here is my take:
1. My bloating has gone down so much which is amazing 
2. Anxiety is definitely prevalent without any opioids. I recommend magnesium and robaxin for muscle relaxation and sleep/regularity, melatonin for sleep, and a lot of vitamins. Also, Delta 8 helped tremendously if you can take it ;)
3. I know it’s hard but keep busy. If not, you will become fixated on the dumbest things and anxiety will increase
4. Work out or go on a walk when you can. You won’t regret
5. Find someone you can be honest with and tell them what’s going on with you. This is a hard time
6. Every timeline is different in terms of how much withdrawal sucks so don’t get too sucked in when you here horror stories. Expect the worse and hope for the best :)

I feel so much more normal after working out especially if I do it first thing in the morning. I was taking 2-10gpd for about a year and a half, which apparently wasn’t enough to give me any horrible physical withdrawal symptoms other than some headaches, sneezing, stuffy nose, and poor sleep for a couple days. I’m sleeping normally again, and actually way better because kratom made me need to pee a million times a day and during the night! My emotions are definitely out of control and the depression is... unpleasant. But I know that this is what happens when you dull and suppress your feelings for a year. 

Just thinking about what it means to be human today. We experience things in contrast: we only know when it’s light because we’ve seen the dark, and we can only truly experience a high when we’ve been deep in a low. Out here in the real world, without the numbness of a thick drug-induced fog, we earn our moments of pleasure. We eat great food with people who love us. We look at beautiful things. We have deep talks late at night. We push ourselves in the gym. We explore out in nature. We do something kind for someone else. We’re creative for our pleasure. We don’t just get bursts of it from drinking green sludge and sitting on the couch!

I guess what I’m trying to say is that the hardest part of my withdrawal was dealing with anger and sadness at the lack of free happy chemicals. My brain played tricks on me and told me I’d never be truly happy or productive or creative again. I’m not back to my old self quite yet, but I’m getting there.

I have been an avid user for just a little over a year now.  I started once we were forced to work from home and my kid/wife were back at daycare/school (wife is a teacher).  Being isolated for about 8-10 hours a day was rough for me, so I looked for something to help.  I found Kratom and initially thought “wow this is great”.. fast forward a few months and I found myself taking way too much, almost 50-70 grams a day.  I realized this was no good, found the will to work down to about 20 grams a day, and never abuse it.  Something began to happen though around 8 month mark.  I was now weighing about 178, I wasn’t a motivated person anymore, I looked at my weight equipment and always told myself “I will get back into it”.  All the muscle I had was being depleted.  All the motivation for work was being depleted.  There were some positives, I was much more talkative/outgoing.. but it comes in waves.  

It finally hit me this past weekend when I was at a wedding (one of the groomsmen), and the pictures of myself said it all..  I was a shell of myself and who I was.  I was ashamed of who I was seeing.  I also realized one of the biggest reasons for taking Kratom was lack of human interaction.  The wedding weekend I think helped me realize I didn’t need this anymore.

These first 72 hours have their downs (bad cold sweats at night, fighting a sinus infection right now too, feelings of worthlessness, feeling tired) and their ups (starting to “feel” again, sex drive returning, desire to do something’s).  I really hope to return to the office soon, to return to my normal amounts of human interaction.  For now, I hope to stay the course and feel 100% normal again in a couple of days.",8,1

This community has helped tremendously in quitting. What helped me so much was reading that it gets better. I know, you don't want to believe it when you are at the start of your journey. But everyone was right. It DOES get better. Keep going! Do I feel completely normal? No. Do I experience PAWS? Sure. Yet, I still feel way better than during my last year dosing, when Kratom finally turned on me (and it will, eventually). 

I also wanted to share some strange observations. I feel stressed all the time as I was looking for a new job, found one and now have to clarify all the details. However, this stress feels so managable at the same time. This is so confusing. I hate the stress but can deal with it. I don't know if ""normal"" people really learn to deal with it through experience or if the feeling of nervosity remains constant. 

Anyways, you all got this. It sucks so much for a period of time, but many things do. As good old Churchill said, If you're going through hell, keep going. Much love!",16,0

I haven't made a genuine attempt at quitting since summer of 2019. I made it 3 days CT, but my doses were only about 11grams 4 times a day, so less than half what I'm at now. I'm supposed to go down a gram each dose every few days and that's exactly what I did this morning. 27 grams but it's troubling how I barely felt anything from that. I'm not in withdrawal or anything yet. 

There's no way I'd be able to CT from such a high GPD, so tapering is my only option. The easiest dose to cut out entirely would be my 6th dose right before bed. I'd have trouble sleeping but I know I can cut it out because that's something I added only a few months ago.

I just don't know if I have it in me to face what's in front of me. I can get a few days off work at the beginning of July so an inpatient detox program is something I'm kind of considering. But I know I have to take control of my situation because I can't keep going on like this. So much money wasted every month, suicidal ideation, and I'm pretty sure I had some type of seizure Sunday night. I blacked out for a minute and was unresponsive. I came to, to my mom on the phone with 9/11. I didn't convulse or anything but that's pretty frightening.

This is exactly the combination of feelings/sensations/discomfort/exhaustion that has sent me scurrying back to the bag again and again. But today I thought of the brave quitters who are pushing through the agony of CT and all the brave quitters at every stage who are enduring every sort of quitting discomfort, and I decided to wait 3 hours til my regular dose time and take only my allotted taper dose. Making coffee and chopping strawberries so close to my kratom station was mildly harrowing but I did not cave. And that was a tiny slice of amazingness.

I have a history of addiction (mostly gabaergics) so I decided it would be wise to just abandon this endeavor as I can see this turning into a real problem but even after a mere 20 days I'm feeling some fairly strong body aches and anxiety just on Day 1 reminiscent of the flu.  Is it possible that this is withdrawal related?  As my dose is still relatively low and 20 days is a short duration of use I'm hoping this will be quick and relatively painless.

Short version," My story is a really long saga of pain and suffering,and in the future I am going to share the best I can, maybe get some better feedback, on this question maybe, or maybe just in general.   and eventually I hope spread hope and inspiration

But for now I am just stuck on my phone at work bored and curious

I don't know how much of this is from kratom VS my history of other drug as well as general unhealthy lifestyle , this includes bad diet way too much nicotine abuse of triple C's and loperamide (like. A LOT of loperamide)


But for the last 2 + years I've been having a lot of issues with my circulation. Its to the point my limbs get asleep super easy and I have no real stamina and can't lift shit for a damn, tried to go to the gym the other day in preparation of a nicotine quit routine and. Could barely do anything. And even tho I trained to failure I didn't even really get sore. 


The times I've been to the doctors they couldn't find anything, I haven't been Ina while I do have a routine checkup on a week. 

But wtf. When I started to have this issue I barely used nicotine Vs now and iirc I didn't drink all thw5 much caffeine.

I'm truly downplaying the issues and my past for the sake of brevity, but have any of y'all had this sort of effect from sustained kratom abuse? I started using everyday around Oct Nov of 2016

Would like some clarity. If I knew this is theain or big contribution to this bs it'd make this a lot easier to motivate a full quit and all. .

It's funny that I'm writing right now, because the first time I read through this channel was around 2 weeks ago. Back then, I was thinking - and I apologize - ""dude, what are they talking about? It's not like it's a hard drug like alcohol.""  


I consider myself a somewhat successful person. I have an own business and I interact with many, many clients each day. And especially Kratom helped me numbing this feeling of anger or disappointment that occured when something went wrong or when a task was more complex than I originally thought it would be. And Kratom helped me with that. I did not focus on that emotion anymore but just did it. Basically, it made me function a lot better and more efficiently. 

I started taking Kratom in 12/2020, around 2-4 GPD.   
Of course, it went from a little to more and more each day, up until 20-30 GPD.  
And at one point, I noticed that I have no effects from it whatsoever. I needed it to become normal again.   


A few days later I was on a LSD trip and was meditating. I started to ask myself: ""What can I do currently to improve my life?""

Mostly when I meditate, on or off LSD, I get quick responses like:  


\- Drink more water  
\- Get up earlier  
\- Read this book  
\- Add this excercise to your workout

etc.

But this time - all I heard was:

""QUIT KRATOM"".

&#x200B;

Alright then, I thought, why not give it a try. The next day I woke up after my trip, I had no cravings at all. And at that point, I was at around 20 GPD.  


But man, shortly after around afternoon, all those negative symptoms started to hit me like a brick. Diarrhea, my legs hurt, my arms hurt, I had to focus not to feel depressed and stressed and that was it. I knew that those were all withdrawal symptoms.   


However, I am not able to go out cold turkey because I have employees that I'm responsible for. I cannot just take 1-2 weeks off, so tapering out is the only way for me.  


However, I went down from 20 GPD to 4 GPD (taken once in the evening in order to be able to sleep better) which is a lot. And of course, I now have withdrawal symptoms as well. I don't feel all too well. It's hard for me to focus, my legs hurt etc.  


That's why I wanted to ask you, community, if I'm able to taper out via not taking it only once before sleeping, but rather splitting it up into 2x 2 grams in the morning, and in the evening, and then reducing it by 0,5g every 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

Would this be a viable option or is that nonesense?  


Looking forward for your reply.

Best,

When you stop, the dam breaks and it can be overwhelming. Channel that emotion into idealism and conviction to propell you towards sobriety and self-respect.","For a long time I have battled the thing I ought to be beating beneath the thing that I am. When I awake in the morning, I want to stop but my aches, shakes, shivers, and lethargy lead me to see myself as weak and needing reprieve. When I listen to music, the dam of emotions I've been blocking gives way and the strength drawn from it has allowed me to make myself begin recovery. Pleasure with no work to get it is a dangerous thing for a man.

 Many of us operate under the assumption that suffering is bad and to be avoided, and pleasure is good and to be sought. Whilst there are unnecessary forms of suffering that are certainly bad, any student of Nietzsche will know the folly of this viewpoint (in particular, read Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche) as pleasure is born from suffering and one cannot be had without the other. If one only pursues hedonistic pleasure and feverishly attempts to avoid any suffering, one will be brought a great deal of suffering and psychological distress eventually in the long, dark hedonistic rabbit hole. If one faces suffering they will be brought to pleasure. 

We are never permanently happy. Marcus Aurelius compared man to be like a dog tied to a moving cart. The dog can either run or can sit and be painfully dragged by the cart. Either way, the cart keeps moving. We can face and choose our suffering and get a great deal out of it or we can be idle and allow our suffering to choose us and get nothing out of it but pain and sorrow. We suffer to achieve hapiness and then do it again and again. Many think of hapiness as this place they will reach if they work hard enough, but this is not so. Hapiness is a reward given for meaningful suffering. It is never permanent, but fret not. Suffering for hapiness gets less  treacherous over time as you build your habits. A thought can become an action, an action can become a habit, habits can become character, and with a character you will reap a destiny.",119,0

No problem falling asleep. At times, sleep can be a bit tossy -turny but it’s sleep. Last night though, I did have some sweats and the room temp was normal. Horrible dreams too. I drank coffee at like 3pm the day before so perhaps I’m just still really sensitive to that. 

My mood is bland. Certainly do not have a bunch of get up and go, but I go anyway. I have been a little irritable and short fused, but it isn’t awful. I have trouble doing nothing (chilling and watching something). I get bored quickly with whatever and begin to think of more productive things I should be doing. I think this is still
Lingering anxiety. I expect this to continue for months. 

Urges and cravings aren’t bad. Maybe one a day and it isn’t strong. I easily dismiss the cravings this early in recovery. It’s later when I’m feeling good again that I can be weaker. I’ll be starting therapy on Thursday to help with that. I’m also doing SMART recovery online to help me plan for moments of weakness.

Need some advice.,"Today is probably my worst day in regards to physical symptoms. Even though RLS and chills had mostly subsided, likely because of my supplements I guess, there is nothing that could help me with persistent nausea. Diarrhea can be partially managed by loperamide but I'm afraid of taking too much or using it on a regular basis. Everything tastes like sawdust and smells even worse, especially when warm. I forced down 3 tablespoons of rice and even that put me on the verge of throwing up. My OTC antiemetic (moxastine teoclate) is not really working plus it's making me very drowsy while triggering RLS at the same time. I'm worried I can't even drink enough water to keep me hydrated enough. I feel like fainting more & more often as the day goes by.

Any suggestions on what should I do/ try?

Thank you for all your support, you are amazing!",3,0

At no point was I functional in any way. In less than 2 weeks of use I wanted to quit quit with all my heart. I just couldn't do it this time. My kratom abuse left me vulnerable to a very toxic relationship, which along with the addiction and depression had completely isolated me.   


It took everything out of me just to get away from that person. And with the pandemic and being stuck on an island that has a tourism-dependent economy (during covid) I've been utterly broke. I look like Christian Bale in the machinist, my BMI is around 15 and I've lost tons of hair. You know how it is.   


I usually wait until life is so bad I finally go cold turkey, but I couldn't do it this time. I barely had enough money to eat one meal a day, no prospects for any work. I needed to hustle just to barely survive and I couldn't afford the sickness of cold turkey. Or at least I couldn't handle the thought of going through that on top of everything else.   


I finally managed to get a full time job and I had my first day yesterday. It's quite intimidating and it doesn't pay well, but it's enough to survive. It's something to build on.   


So the plan is to taper slowly. I think it will be better for me because that would force me to confront my real problem, which is lack of self control and motivation. I secretly love the intense drama of a cold turkey quit, and the delusionally manic happiness that follows.   


I can't imagine what it would be like to quit this gradually. All I've ever known is dying in the fire of withdrawal and being reborn a new. Now I want to discover who I am inbetween all of that. I have no idea. It's like I've been one of 2 people and now I want to put those pieces together.   


What I'm going to do is taper down 5% every day. I've been using 50-60gpd and I weighed out 40g for today to start. Then I'll use a calculator to step down 5% ever day. I've written it out in a document and it would take at least 3 months to get to 1g.   


The first month would be quite fast, but from what I've read here the beginning is the easiest part with tapers. Using a percentage means that the lower my dose, the smaller the increments. I'm very curious what this experience will be like. Having to work 8 hours a day is going to help me stick to it, I think. I genuinely want to do a good job, so I'm motivated.   


My addiction wouldn't really hurt my ability to perform professionally. But it's my social life, mental and physical health that's in the gutter. Anyway, I just wanted to make it official by posting here. Let me know if you've had experience with tapering down in percentage based increments.",9,2

Have anyone of you succeed to kick k by stretching the dose take as far as RLS appears and then take like 3 g or less?

And that way take less and less per day until it's done/jump is tolerable.

Withdrawals were fairly bad, but it was like the third time I had to go through it cause I just kept relapsing even after weeks or months without it, so I got what I deserved.
But now is that time again, recently I got sort of flashbacks, moments were I felt that warm, comforting feeling that I get on Kratom but only for a brief moment. Also I've been in a slump lately, and in the first few days and weeks of usage I usually am a lot more focused to study and do other important stuff (before it all turns to shit and I become lethargic), so I really want to get just a little bit. It's just so fucking tempting and I'm glad it's as gross as it is (had a few times when I almost threw up because some powder was stuck in my throat or something like that), because otherwise I probably would have bought some already.

Anyway, just posting this here to have more of an incentive to stay off.

12-15 GPD, 6 years

I tapered for a few weeks. Didn’t follow a regimen just tapered slow enough to avoid the restless nights. Tapered down to 1 gram at night before jumping.  

So far the noticeable and worst of my WD include:
- Total sleep pattern upheaval (insomnia + fatigue)
- Fatigue during day, I can nap multiple times a day and drink coffee and still feel so tired
- Occasional SPLITTING headache that lasts for about 5 minutes 

My tips (even tho it’s just day 3 but I’ve tapered for a month or so now):
- Go to the gym (daily) for that dopamine and that muscle ache. 
- Eat as much as you want, don’t eat shitty food. 
- If you’re going to be up all night, clean or do something productive. Might as well!

In sum: The insomnia is most annoying and I hope it goes soon. Cravings are non existent when you know there is no option for relapse. Get shredded and blame the aches on the gym.

Enjoy this WD experience. The pain can be a high of its own. The battle can be part of the reward. Perspective is key - don’t forget that life isn’t all peachy on the other side. After WD is over you will still face more battles but will have valuable experience from your victory in this one ❤️",6,0
