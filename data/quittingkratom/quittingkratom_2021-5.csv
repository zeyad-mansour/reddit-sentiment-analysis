1-Thinking more clearly/better focus.
2-Skin is clearing up.
3-More ambition/energy.
4-Money saved.
5-Less anxiety.
6-Weight loss (I think I was retaining water due to my kratom use)
7-No more inflammation in my joints between doses.
8-Don‚Äôt have to worry about getting more K.
9-Better sleep.
10-Overall sense of well being.
11-Enjoying life more.
12-Enjoying music again.
13-Laughing again.

7 weeks in and feeling good. This is what I've been dealing with on my second month so far.

In the earlier parts of the month it felt like I was trying to move through quick sand whenever I would try and move around. This has gotten better, my energy is no longer that killed. Still pretty low but not gone like that. Digestive system is still fucked up. Slowly getting better though. The PAWS from this shit has been pretty bad. Started to really feeling it this month. Way worse than I thought they were gonna be but I'm just glad the really uncomfortable mental stuff is gone for now. That psychosis shit and all that.

Mood/Appetite/Energy/Sleep is a rollercoaster. Constant up and down. Good one day, horrible the next. Good for a few days, horrible for a few days. What'll happen sometimes too is I'll have these brief moments, not everyday just every once in a while, where I almost freak out that I actually quit taking it. 

It happened earlier today actually, I was watching youtube right after waking up. Usually when I do this, I don't think anything of it but on days like today my brain will go ""hmm this is really weird, something isn't right."" My body got a little chill when I thought of my past self waking up every morning, immediately dosing, then doing whatever the fuck I wanted. I usually freak out a little in my head for a bit, then its just this lingering feeling in my chest and stomach like fuck fuck fuck. Just straight agony for a lil, then we back solid. It's really weird. This often really doesn't last that long though, I don't dwell on it. You really can't in the early stages.

Hope everybody is well",10

2021-05-30 18:26:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nom7ov/1_month/,1 month!,"Hey everyone - long time lurker here, but I‚Äôve never really posted. I‚Äôve been using Kratom for about 4 years now - started in college as a once in a while thing, but naturally (for me) that turned into a daily habit. I took Kratom primarily during the morning/day for energy and motivation (both for work and social situations). I have ADHD and was not taking any medication for it, but about 6 months ago I was prescribed a stimulant that basically served the purpose that the Kratom was serving. The only issue was, at that point, I was completely addicted to the kratom, so I continued to use it alongside the new medication. I never viewed Kratom as so terrible in terms of the science - I have been addicted to much stronger drugs and Kratom has always seemed like not a big deal compared. But what‚Äôs terrible about the Kratom, at least for me, is 3-fold:

1. It is addicting. For me (luckily), the dependence was/is more emotional than physical. I would be anxious if I didn‚Äôt have enough for my daily dose, I took it even when I didn‚Äôt want to or need to, etc.

2. One of the reasons I love Kratom (and substances in general) is because I like to have control over the way that I feel. Whenever I felt anxious, or down, or bored, Kratom was a way for me to take control over those negative emotions and turn them into something that felt ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. What I have figured out, however, is that turning off negative emotions (artificially) is not healthy, and it only pushes those emotions off for a later time. I have found that without Kratom, I have been able to deal with negative emotions in healthier ways. Kratom was just a non-sustainable shortcut. 

3. Stomach issues. Together with my nightly cannabis use (and subsequent binge eating), I got into the habit of waking up every morning with a stomach ache, which was only curable by taking Kratom. As soon as the Kratom and its constipating (sorry if TMI!) effects wore off, my stomach would be a mess again. Without enough knowledge on the long term effects of Kratom usage, I couldn‚Äôt ever be sure that the way I was altering my GI tract would not cause long term damage. 

For these reasons and more, I decided to quit. That was 3 months ago. I was worried about withdrawal so I went to an outpatient detox facility, where I got clean and then was given a Vivitrol shot (for those who don‚Äôt know, a vivitrol shot blocks opioid receptors in the brain so that even if you take Kratom, you won‚Äôt feel it). Unfortunately, I still had Kratom in my system and I went into precipitated withdrawal - by far the worst experience of my life. I felt terrible for two weeks. But even after all of that, as soon as the vivitrol shot wore off I went right back to using Kratom, and before I knew it I was back to my daily dosing. 

Last month, I decided that enough was enough, and I quit Kratom CT. I was more comfortable doing it this time because when I quit CT at the detox facility, I didn‚Äôt have any bad withdrawal effects (that is, not until the vivitrol shot induced them). It has now been a month without Kratom, and I feel great. I also stopped using other substances during this time (alcohol, weed, etc), which was also a great decision. Although I do intend on bringing alcohol and weed back into my life, I don‚Äôt intend on ever taking Kratom again. It is too easy to fall back into the habit of taking it everyday. 

Sorry for the long post - just wanted to share my story and thank you all for the support! This thread is great and it‚Äôs so good to know that other people are going through the same thing. If you have any questions for me or if I can help any of you trying to quit Kratom, please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.",5

Yesterday I woke up feeling 100% better. I took the day to enjoy my family we went for a walk on the beach and I soaked in every minute. It's like I missed a year chasing a feeling that I never found again. Today is even better but I'm a little emotional. I look at my family and think how could I waste all that time.

2021-05-30 14:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nohaom/last_dose/,Last dose.,"I'm throwing myself off that flight of stairs guys.  9 months of very heavy Kratom use and I'm not capable of tapering because of my nature of addiction. I haven't been able to go CT due to how physically demanding my job is. I now have 1 week off and just spread all my Kratom ceremonially in the forest and have been psyching myself up for the big fight.  It's going to be rough but I'm going in.  People have been through much, much worse and I owe it to myself and the rest of my life to be clean again.

Short history, been a hardcore addict on the entire spectrum of substances since I was a teenager.  I'm 36 YO now. Was completely sober for 3 years by a miracle.  Alcohol almost killed me twice.  8 months ago I had a painful relationship end and in a moment of weakness, I turned back to the green monster.  I have kicked every type of drug before and I know kicking heavy K usage is just as bad or worse than everything out there. Though non life threatening. 

A couple things I might have going for me. I have always been very active, daily mountain biking, long distance running, Ect.  Maybe I can kick it out of my system somewhat swiftly if I take everyone's advice about staying busy and moving.  Also I have a place to detox for an entire week with zero obligations. 

My weapons prescribed for this fight: 
Clonodine 
Gabapentin
(Dosage recommendations greatly appreciated)

Supplements (thanks to this group)
Ashwagandha, BSO, Magnesium  Citrate, D3, BComplex and a Multivitamin.   

Thanks guys, any other advice totally appreciated.  I want my life back so bad.  It's been going mostly great, new Girlfriend, best trail dog ever, new Mountain Bike.  but I am on the verge of total destruction if I dont dig myself out right now.",11

I worked my way down to 24gpd for a long while (instead of dosing every 2 hours I dosed every 3 hours), then cut it in half down to 12gpd for about 2 weeks before jumping from there. I'm so glad I made that spontaneous decision to jump from 12gpd.

The irritation, the staring at the clock waiting for the next dose, being content with doing nothing for months and months, the unwanted internal hallucinations, the pinpoint pupils, the constipation, the feeling like shit every morning, the not wanting to leave the house, the dependency... The End.

Never again. I fell for the ""it's like coffee!"" meme, I didn't believe my hair was falling out, I didn't think the random rages were attributed to my kratom use, I didn't *want* to believe it... This has been said many times before, but ""it's great, until it isn't"" is pretty accurate. Stockholm Syndrome, except to a leaf.

Three of my grandparents died while I was on this drug. It masked my emotions, it made me docile and content, it's an escape. It's like I wasn't human, just high all the time. As much as I wish I never started taking kratom, I don't regret it, but I'll never take it again either.

I quit May 19th, and the past 2 days (days 9, and 10) have been great. The first week was a roller coaster of mostly downs, some pretty rough days there. If it wasn't for other people who cared I don't think I'd have been able to keep it together. A huge weight has been lifted. I'm starting to feel normal again, and it's great.

Walking around places helps a ton, any sort of cardio really. Even if you aren't full on exercising, just moving around helps immensely. Also, dancing is a blast once you get over the acute withdrawal hump. I'd also take L-theanine, which seems to help but very well could be a placebo. I have access to a whole bottle of Lyrica, but didn't take a single one, which I'm proud of.

The anxiety for the first 7 days was occasionally horrendous, but mostly consistent. While I didn't have a panic attack, I got close. I'd have delusions of palpitations, then take my BP and it would be high which would just caused more anxiety, and the cycle would keep going. **Withdrawal fucks with your head more than anything, you can easily hype yourself up to think that there's a big problem, when there really isn't.**

Also, the insomnia is by far the worst symptom for me. I still have it and hope it goes away soon, but getting 4ish hours (give or take one) is fucking amazing compared to getting only 40 minutes like I was. It's currently tolerable. I'm just glad to be over the worst of it. I'm aware PAWS can creep in later on, but honestly, I had bouts of depression and anxiety in my past which is why I started kratom in the first place. I can get through it.

I feel like I have a new lease on life and it's only been only 11 fucking days. This post is a mess, but thanks for reading. Clich√©, but, it most definitely gets better. Power through it, don't give up. You're stronger than you think.",24

Something to add, my stomach is not right yet, my hunger is outta wack & food kinda repulses me most the time. I also have IBS which has not been fun during this WD. So anyway...
An hour into my flight and BAM My face is hot, heart rate high, sweating & stomach is in knots. I start to tell myself to relax, it‚Äôs all in your mind. Nothing works. So I get up and go to the bathroom and immediate release when I take the mask off and feel the cooler air in the bathroom. I should also add in in an aisle seat (FML!!) I sit here for 5 min before leaving. I feel better! 
Then 10min later... same thing. I go back, humiliated Bc I know ppl probably see me. But this time I have that awful feeling in my stomach I dread & I know I need to go. So I go and then feel a lot better. But then, the crippling anxiety returns!! I start to panic now. 

So here‚Äôs what worked- I do have Ativan and my adaptogens in my carryon, along with my adderrall. These help yes, but I don‚Äôt take them everyday, (the adaptogens I usually do and I highly recommend y‚Äôall do some research on this! Amazing, or dm me!) 

So I got up and just stood, focused on my breathing. REALLY focused on my breathing..... counted to 10 then from 10 back down to 1. Meanwhile Closed my eyes or looked out the window. Then with each number, with my pointer finger I would poke the other palm and alternate. Sounds strange, but guys.... I did this for about 5min and I feel incredibly calm. Amazing actually.

Im just not sure everyone on this sub is aware of the dangers of gabapentin. I was on a truly ludicrous amount. And like any other drug it provided relief and euphoria - but required more and more to sate that threshold. And i started at a minimum dose just as everyone does.


Gabapentin withdrawal is one of - if not the worst withdrawal imaginable imo.

Please folks - treat gabapentin with respect. If you have the nature about you and proclivity towards addictive tendencies do some looong and hard thinking about whether you have the will power to use gabapentin briefly and cease use abruptly - so as not to catch a habit. 


Psychiatrists are usually strangely quick to dole out gabapentin as its currently in a legal grey area as to its status as a drug and what degree of what it should be considered.

(I suspect pharma reps influenced the initial big waves of prescriptions but thats all conjecture)


Nonetheless - i was inititally prescribed gabapentin and dont feel my doc made any effort whatsoever to inform me the addiction i was committing myself to.


I also believe ive read studies that show gabapentin with prolonged use can somehow discourage the easy recollection and storage of long term memories to some degree or another. 


Alls im tryna say is gabapentin withdrawal can be just as serious as kratom withdrawal - if not significantly worse - as was my experience.

I used to take an 1-2 OPMS shots a day. Theyre about 20$ and i believe they have from 30-50 grams worth of extract. I have knocked down to a 5$ 5 hour energy looking bottle that is much less powerful. Idk all of them dont do much for me anymore. Will continuing to do less and less until i jump to CT. Will the withdrawl be less harsh physical wise?,3
2021-05-30 01:29:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/no4anm/increased_appetite/,Increased Appetite,"Day 17 CT.  I feel almost back to normal minus the fatigue in the mornings and mid day depression. The depression isn't anything debilitating, just a mild sadness and blah feeling. I also still have trouble getting to sleep at night. Once I fall asleep, I can stay asleep, it's just the falling asleep part im still struggling with. 

Aside from that I feel great and my life has already gotten significantly better since quitting. It gets better guys. I promise you. Just take it one day at a time and try not to focus or dwell too much on the bad days because for me, that just made it worse. I just powered through and embraced the suck. 

My question to you is when did your appetite return to normal? Once the acutes went away my appetite came back to apparently catch up on all the years I was destroying my bode. I've been eating what seems like my body weight in food each day for the last week and almost never feel full. I've even gained 10 pounds since the acutes went away around day 10. I'm not complaining one bit about the weight gain because K completely destroyed my appetite and had me looking like skin and bone. Again, I'm happy about the weight gain but when did the constant hunger stop? I don't want to be gaining 10 pounds every few weeks from here on out. 

As always, I love every one of you guys for helping me pull the trigger on my sobriety and starting my life back up again. I don't think I could have done it without all of you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You all saved my life.",9

Day 1 and 2 i had off work so i said fuck it im not taking kratom today i need to stop this shit its giving me brain fog and i dont like being addicted to something. It also ruined marijuana for me which sucked. It made me super anxious when i smoke. Now weed has been a lifesaver while withdrawling.

Today marks day 90 for me. It's been a long strange trip. If you are still early in your quit, it gets better. Way better. I haven't posted in a while but I check in every few days or so. I never imagined 90 days ago I'd be here, but I am so thankful and happy that I made it here. I turned 40 in these 90 days, and I feel better now than I have in years. Thankful for the long days and weeks of the struggle. Thankful for this sub and all the contributors. Stay strong and keep pushing the days out of the way. I will leave you with  quote that I came across that resonated with me early in my quit and still to this day. It really spoke to me about chasing the first high you get that you never really achieve again, so you keep upping and upping your dose to find that euphoria that made you fall in love.  It helped me to realize after I quit that the negative I was going through was actually a positive experience. Good day quitter's!!

For the first few days the RLS and emotions coming to terms with being off kratom were insane. Then before the week was over most of the acutes were gone with gabapentin and vitamin C. Vitamin C obliterated the vast majority of the flu symptoms. Biggest problem has been intense fatigue which has improved quite a bit since day 2 when it was worst. Since day 2 (when RLS started) I've been taking gabapentin every night to sleep through the night. Gonna be gradually lowering my dose over the next 2 weeks and return to sporadic use with that (scripted).

Some changes are that my abnormal caffeine sensitivity/anxiety response to it has completely reversed and I've been going through 300-600mg a day just to get up and moving. Though I've noticed that the fatigue has lessened. Today instead of caffeine I took a small dose of adderall which was underwhelming but definitely helped. Had a bit of caffeine in the form of a few cups of diet coke, and noticed I had more energy than usual on my post-work run, when usually I'd have to drink a large starbucks coffee before it and my legs would still feel like lead. Stopped the vitamin C a few days ago too, and aside from some minor bouts sneezing the past week (which apparently is a sign of withdrawal ending--can vouch for this anecdotally) I feel fine. I don't get chills anymore, no sneezing today either.

&#x200B;

Emotionally I feel far calmer and less anxious/stressed. Really it's kind of amazing. I hope it's not some ""pink cloud"" moment but it doesn't feel like some magical state of well being. I just feel better and it's a natural type of good feeling.

&#x200B;

My chronic fatigue started in the early days of my daily kratom use, and I couldn't get out of bed before 1pm even with 12 hours of sleep. I'd usually be up till 4-6am and would sleep till 3pm. Now, I'm going to bed around 12pm¬±1h and waking up at 8-9am before my alarm even goes off and I feel much more rested. I still have a ways to go with chronic fatigue and more broadly what I suspect is kratom-induced hypothyroidism but I am doing so much better than I was 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago, and especially when I was on kratom daily. It's such an innocuous looking drug but it fucks up your mental and physical health and daily routine so badly without you even realizing that it's happening.

The day before yesterday I was able to run a little over a mile and a half then had to walk for a few minutes but then went back at it. Yesterday was about the same. Today I ran my full 30 minutes and then did 30 minutes of weight training.

It‚Äôs funny, I go in my small home gym with chills not wanting to do shit. After a few minutes of moving the chills go away. Maybe a few chills but just from the music. So I think I‚Äôm feeling about as good as I can at this point.

Oh, I read a post this morning from a guy who just lost his dad and he is using that as motivation to quit. It was the first time I have cried in five years. I know this kind of emotion won‚Äôt last but it is pretty cool to get some feels again. Praying for that guy. It‚Äôs hard to lose your dad.

I suppose to an extent I didn't want my usage to sound as high as it was ... ? I wouldn't call it intentionally lying to you all or I would have never mentioned the 50+ but I think at some level I didn't want to admit it.

With epilepsy we have common triggers. One major one is lack of sleep. I get a certain benzo that I can take for clusters of seizures to prevent hospitalization or worse. In the past I've had long stretches of bad sleep that have led to induced comas. I'm sharing this portion mostly to in a way counteract the positive things I've said in the past about kratom and epilepsy. It is (and I stand by) one of the few stimulating things that are safe for us to take as opposed to amphetamines and such but the withdrawal insomnia can potentially be literally killer. For anyone interested in specifics without me writing a book, google ""status epilepticus"". My last bout went on over 2 hours before being put into a coma to end it and after trying to wake me multiple times, they had to keep me under for almost a week for it to actually stop. Told my wife I'd likely be in a vegetative state and/or unable to walk. Epileptics - beware of the withdrawal!

So yesterday morning after another 14 hours in bed of pretty much no sleep regardless of supplements or medicines taken - combined with the fact that attempting to refill my ""emergency med"" aka benzos too soon can result in me losing them for real emergencies - I began a taper.

My normal ""morning dose"" prior to beginning quitting was about 21 grams split in three 7 gram doses over about 3 hours. Any more at once and I'd puke it up. Toss and wash.

I started with 4 grams stirred up with 2 grams of matcha around 10am once the headshop was open. Luckily the local shops' quality rivals the big internet shops easily. 3 grams around noon, 3 around 6pm and 2.5 before bed for a whopping total of 12.5 grams.

My withdrawal headache remained as did my nausea however my chills and all signs of RLS disappeared. It again took me almost 2 hours to fall asleep (though this itself could have been from the kratom) but I actually managed to get a solid 8 hours. Literal emergency avoided.

I'm going to stick to the same plan for a week, dropping 1g/day total. Luckily my loving wife has been through me quitting worse including decades-long alcoholism that ended in massive withdrawal after drinking daily/all day. Luckily I wasn't the dick-type drinker. She's stashing the kratom in between doses in random spots so it's out of sight and ""out of mind"".

I can tell I need a few good night's worth of sleep so it won't be more than a 1g drop a day for at least a few days. At that, it's less than 25% of where I was and still under where I'd started at 14/day.

Some at this point may feel failure. Personally, I don't. When it comes to serious medical conditions sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I'm still as determined to quit as when I started cold-turkey and each dose I've taken has left me with the satisfying feeling of disgust I'd get after I quit drinking and have a ""slip up"".

I can refill that medication in 2 weeks. Honestly I could now but don't like to too frequently. Whatever amount I'm taking at that point will be rather low and I'll finish cold turkey again.

I guess the biggest thing I can take from this is that nearly a week of CT after 50g/day dropped my tolerance enough for less than 15/day to suffice. Prior to that, I couldn't even start my day with only 15 without feeling some withdrawals later in the day and always had to do around 10g before bed so progress has been made.

I'll post back soon.",13

I have two shiba inu. One of them fell asleep in my arms, then I woke up to pee and the other one wanted hugs, so I feel like they calmed me down too. Plus, I don't have work today, so I slept in just a bit - which feels *amazing!*

I felt a slight temptation to use last night, but that's when I started moving and didn't stop until the feeling passed, and I felt great. Enjoyed the nature, enjoyed the trails, even enjoyed just seeing people out enjoying themselves.

Im a 28 year old male who‚Äôs struggled with kratom and alcohol addiction for years now. I‚Äôve had spells of sobriety, the most recent being a little over a hundred days. I started using kratom again for almost 50 days at low doses and wasn‚Äôt kidding myself any more. Thursday was my last dose. I awoke Friday morning to find out father passed away on may 21 at 4:02 am. I was destroyed. My father was my best friend and my biggest supporter in sobriety. He was also a recovering alcoholic but had been entirely sober basically my entire life. I was as open as a book with him because I knew he wouldn‚Äôt judge me only love and support me. As many people do when actively using, you isolate and become distant. Out of fear, shame, embarrassment etc etc. and I felt tremendous guilt and regret for not appreciating the time I had with him.
anyway, when I found out, I surprisingly didn‚Äôt want to use anymore. I could hear my dad saying ‚Äúaye yo it‚Äôs me papa bear, look son you have a choice on how you handle this, let it be an excuse to ruin you, or a chance to change your life for the best! Love you dawg‚Äù and that‚Äôs my motivation. We finally buried my father yesterday and I haven‚Äôt taken any Kratom or a sip of booze. My dad would be so proud of me I know it. I can feel him guiding me towards being the man he knew I am and wanted me to be. Sometimes it takes a tragedy to bring miracles into your life. Stay strong everyone, and go love your loved ones, allow yourself to feel weak so you know when your strong. Love all of you, and R.I.P Dad",92

I had a horrible RLS & anxiety episode accompanied with shortness of breath last night when trying to fall asleep. Tbh I felt like I was going to die. After couple of hours I managed to concentrate on my breathing, somehow fell asleep and woke up after 6 hours, went to the bathroom and then slept for another 2 hours, which is a great success imho.
Yesterday I found out that I was exceptionally sensitive to DXM, I took just 20 mg in a syrup form along with 500mg Agmatine + several loperamide caps to prevent diarrhea and I felt very surreal, distant and derealized for hours! For me, the feeling of not being here has always been rather unpleasant so I won't be taking any more DXM even though I think it does ease some of wd symptoms.
Today I'm experiencing extreme fatigue, hot & cold flashes, nausea and mild RLS. I'm disgusted at how awfull all food tastes, I'm unable to eat and hardly able to drink though I know I have to. I used to enjoy my meals so much on kratom! 
The only positive feeling I have is HOPE, which I haven't felt for months. This is what keeps me alive. I'm planning to go for a walk this afternoon, let's see if I will be able to. I find it hard to convince myself & try any other physical activity but I have always loved long walks in nature. 

My supplements: Ginseng, Ashwagandha, Griffonia, liposomal vit C, ZMA, Agmatine, CBD oil, Lion's Mane, kava kava extract, Valeriana, GABA, black seed oil. 
Vit C, magnesium and Agmatine seem to help most so far but it's quite early to make any conclusions.
I also have some Modafinil 150mg tabs but reluctant to try as I'm scared it would trigger anxiety/ panic attacks and deteriorate my nausea.

 I kept trying to make excuses of the Kratom not affecting me. 

I took two heaping table spoons twice a day. One in the morning one late afternoon. I initially started taking it to stop drinking alcohol I was having a pint a day for about two years and heard about Kratom from my wife‚Äôs mom and It actually worked but instead of quitting after a while I substituted Kratom with the alcohol. It‚Äôs been 3 years of this and I would consider myself someone who functions well despite using. 

I get in a fog sometime and my memory is horrible since I‚Äôve been using. My wife started shortly after me and I‚Äôve been trying to get her to quit but she keeps buying more and when it‚Äôs in the house I just have an urge to make a cup. She knows about this group and has read some stories and doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big enough deal to quit because of her dosage and she really has no intention on quitting. So I‚Äôm putting my foot down for myself and just saying I‚Äôve officially had my last cup. Any advice on convincing wife and what do you do during the times you want that cup.

I'm in a hotel right now due to a pretty drastic change in my life, an incident happened with my significant other on Tuesday that I posted about a couple days ago. I had to get out of our living situation. I'm going to be spending the summer with my family in a pretty safe environment for an addict. Somehow, even though it was readily available through this pretty traumatic experience, I did not buy kratom. I knew that I would literally be 5x as fucked up after. Definitely in a lot of pain from it still though, and it probably hasn't fully hit me that were really separated. I had some physicals symptoms the first couple days, not as bad as my oxy WDs but definitely rough. But the mental aspect has been so bad. The worst depression and anxiety I've ever had by far, and I've been really bad at times before. Bad insomnia probably made it worse. Just the most overwhelming dark cloud ever. I'm also trying to quit weed, but have given in during this period. This has been the hardest part: in my bouts of major depression in the past, as bad as it was, I would always get some relief at night as I got closer to going to sleep (even though ive never slept great). With this kratom depression, I woke up feeling horrible, and knew that I would only feel worse throughout the entire day. It was worst at night, and that coupled with the insomnia was really breaking me. Somehow I pushed through, this sub and going to a few meetings probably saved me. Finally, as of last night and today, it seems to be getting better at night. Still really dark at times earlier in the day, but By 10 pm, I was feeling okay enough to play some games/talk with my best friends online. smoking probably had a little to do with that, but I've also been able to smoke a lot less the last couple days. I'm feeling like I actually might be able to get really sober again soon. That's hope lol. Anyway, just wanted to give a thorough update for anyone who might be in a similar position.

No, I was wrong. It boggles my mind what happens when your body and brain are trying to heal. 

I knew a day like this was coming and don‚Äôt know how long it will last but I am writing this to remind myself, it doesn‚Äôt matter how long it lasts because it doesn‚Äôt. It isn‚Äôt a feeling to stay. 

It‚Äôs my brain trying to reset itself. In times like this where it feels like any emotion is non existent, all your minds worries seem to come at once and you start to question everything for no reason. 

When it‚Äôs the first rainy day of the summer but it some how feels like it‚Äôs been raining for weeks and isn‚Äôt going to stop raining even though I was just enjoying the sunshine mowing the lawn two days ago.

About 10 days ago I made a decision to once and for all read myself of this green sludge. I‚Äôve been using this ‚Äú‚Äú supplement for almost 5 years. I‚Äôve tried often on to quit using various supplements as well as tapering message none of which have worked well. I have a wonderful psychiatric nurse practitioner who knows some of the details of what is going on but it‚Äôs not very familiar familiar with what Kratom does and how to deal with withdrawal. However she was willing to prescribe me a week of 1 mg anti anxiety medication (controlled) to help abate anxiety symptoms as I tired a taper. She figure my current use was so small, but had read that tapping from small doses can be more difficult that larger. I had also been trying to semintaper over the pass months, so my use was doesn. I also had a single opiate tablet from a previous medical procedure, but ended up flushing it as it didn‚Äôt seem to have a point. I started on Day one with 2 0.5 gram caps in the morning and 2 at night. I did this for two days, and on day three, woke up with no symptoms to speak of other than loose bowl.  I had some trouble sleeping but no RLS. I just got up and did house work. Imodium helped the intestinal discomfort. On Day three I took two caps in the morning and none at night. Days 4-9 have been ok‚Äîskill some intestinal discomfort, some anxiety (prescribed med seems to help but using sparingly). I think keeping busy with the end of school and all of the packing and things that we have to do for our job has helped me maintain an exercise routine that has helped keep my mind focused and my body busy. 

For historical reference, I started about five years again with the same brand of Kratom and never changed. As my tolerance built, I found myself taking four caps (2gm) each morning and suffering until 4 pm, where I would take four. Ober the years, that grew to 16-24 caps a day. Over time, this built up, and a 240 cap bag (144 grams) would last a week, tops. At 48.10 a pack that adds up. 

I know the this is probably it the end of it and May fall. But for the first time in five years I have hope.",2

Am posting bc I dont have anyone to talk to in real life anymore, as I have lied and hidden this (admittedly mild) relapse yet again.

Was severe opiate addict for nearly 12 years, with 3 years of sobriety from 2012-2015. Fall 2019 I ended up in the ICU, they sent me to a rehab facility for 3 months. I got off everything, and was doing pretty ok.

Exactly 13 months ago I started using Kratom and have used it daily since, I use a kilogram every 15-20 days, so around 55-75 grams a day depending on the day, I did experience side effects from this much powder, skin/stomach issues. Im sure my brain is absolutely fried from years of Oxymorphone, Fent, and H abuse and maybe thats why I needed really big doses to really notice much opiate effect. I was surprised to find that 7-10 grams of Kratom is almost identical to a low dose of Hydrocodone or Oxycodone with a coffee. It really is remarkably similar to mild narcotics, so obviously this was 100% predictable how it would turn out for me.

Anyway quit cold turkey 9 days ago, did not taper I cant do it, with anything really. I just have to hard stop its only way I can kick anything. The WD is identical to a very mild opiate WD, its mild enough where I can vaguely watch TV while feeling shit, or eat soup, or go for a very easy walk in the sun. The predictable crying spells, hopelessness, absolute self loathing. All there just turned down. But its unmistakably opiate WD, identical really just toned way down. The idea there is no WD syndrome or it being less painful than quitting coffee was always dubious to me, but now its just patently ridiculous. Basically people are getting themselves into a mild opiate dependency without really knowing it, which pisses me off people should be honest about this take off the rose colored glasses. To me its basically Codeine or Hydrocodone light. Which STILL means you are going to get you ass absolutely whooped in WD regardless, a very mild opiate WD is still absolute horrible shit, just miserable suffering, as always. There is a weird idea that if you're not kicking heroin shitting yourself to death in a bathtub unable to move or even think at all through the insane fever dream state (been there many times), that quitting is easy. bullshit really its all relative and it all is fucking terrible. and its fucking hard to give up this plant regardless. 

Anyway I am just rambling now, waiting for the symptoms to fully subside so I can enter the predictable zombie state of non-being for the next months. At the moment all thats left at day 9 is

runny nose, sneezing, yawning, mild RLS, aches, diarrhea, gooseflesh/chills, slightly dilated pupils. Most have gotten better by now. Also I am 34 and withdrawn from opiates literally dozens of times, and it does in fact get worse and worse the more times you do it, especially if youve gotten your brain extremely fucked up enough with potent opiates. Its like it supercharges future WD episodes. And I am positive why some have such an easier/harder time kicking it.

Mostly its the same old intense depression, self hatred, absolute rage, hopelessness cocktail of defeat and anger that I didn't stick it out after 7-8 months sober, but it'll pass. I am 34 years old now and have been going around this fucking carousel my entire adult life, dont be me. Always seize the opportunity to really get better and live life, if it takes losing a job, being honest with those who love you, etc etc. Just do it no matter how much it sucks. Dont be me and waste half your life slaving for these fucking opiates. Good luck, love to everyone",84

2021-05-28 13:28:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nn2y65/my_story/,My Story,"I was introduced to Kratom about a year ago. I've been sober from alcohol for 7 years. I started using it daily about 10 months ago. It helped a lot with my depression and anxiety. I wasn't really feeling the high all that much, just feeling free and normal. I've been on diazapam for years. 15 mg/day at one point. I was down to 12 mg/day when I started using Kratom. I was instantly able to drop to only 4 mg/day and have stayed at that dosage. I also didn't crave any alcohol at all.

Back to the Kratom, I quickly upped my dosage to 7-8 g, 3-4 times a day. So about 32 gpd for the last 9 months or so. I usually drink one red bull per day.

I also chew a shit load of nicotine gum. It's an old habit and it hasn't gotten any better.

The honeymoon is over. It's no longer helping me, I wake up stressed and feeling shitty. Upping my dose doesn't do what it initially did. 

I woke up this morning and it seemed I was no better than before I started....maybe worse. The last thing I need is another habit hanging over my head so I'm going to do a taper. And use this sub as support. I also texted my old therapist to see if they had any openings. I'm probably going to need it. I didn't need therapy when I started using kratom. It would be crazy to stop using kratom if it continued to help me like it did for several months, but that's just not the case. 

Thoughts and Prayers to anyone going through this. I'm scared and I haven't even started yet.",13

I've been stuck on my taper for a very long time. Currently, I'm over 6 weeks holding at this level and still having PAWS symptoms. I'm a 14yr user, and have tapered from about 40gpd down to 18gpd. This taper was done over several months, very slowly and carefully. 

So I hit a wall in my taper. At 18gpd for over 6 weeks, and still having PAWS. This last week, I tapered back a bit again regardless of the PAWS. On day #8 of my reduction, I'm still having acutes from this drop. I'm just miserable after being in PAWS for months, and the severity of the acutes on top of that when I try to reduce is just crushing my soul at this point.

I ordered some naltrexone online, but no idea when it will arrive. I plan on trying to use ULDN and then switch to LDN when I jump off completely. I'm really hoping the ULDN can help me get past ths wall in my taper and I can start to reduce more quickly. Just feel like I'm never going to get off of it at this rate, and the PAWS this whole time is killing me.

While waiting for my naltrexone, I was considering trying a normal dose of DXM. Maybe 15-30mg twice daily to see if that helps with tolerance reduction. Has anyone here used DXM in this way and feel that this would help me?

I'm not looking to use high doses of DXM, just maybe see if 15-30mg twice daily for a few weeks might help until I cann switch over to ULDN.

Thanks in advance",3

I just wanted to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation for all of you here. It is so extremely helpful to feel as if you have a tribe, especially when trying to conquer a difficult time. It‚Äôs been almost 4 weeks since I quit cold turkey. I was about to move in to a new place with my girlfriend and I really didn‚Äôt want to bring this habit with me. I had been using varying amounts for 3ish years. I got really in to extracts at the end of my run so that made it a bit more difficult to stop. The first 3 days were quite difficult but I only had difficulty sleeping the first two. Ive felt a baseline anxiety/depression every day since then. Thankfully I have a boss who I can be honest with and understood my situation. 

I realized this morning that I felt genuine excitement without the aid of any substance. I haven‚Äôt felt that in years. I still have plenty of anxiety but exercising has been super helpful and everyday the anxiety subsides a bit more. 

I just wanted to stop by to provide a bit of hope for anyone who is thinking about quitting. The first couple weeks will suck but you WILL feel the old you start to come back. I believe in each and every one of you.",17

It's strange walking past some of these little shops with signs flashing that they sell kratom. Makes me wonder how many people here have been through this/will be going through this. Walking and cycling feels good though, and this one shop I frequent that sells CBD just started selling skateboard decks and parts, so idk ... it's been a long time, and I'm not 20 anymore, but maybe a longboard? I just want to keep myself moving - it helps.

Slept alright last night - I definitely think the CBD and melatonin help and are a good combination for me, and magnesium too, although you have to be careful because that can give you the shits if you take too much, I've found. Got a little sweaty, but acceptable levels. Insomnia is the final boss of withdrawal. 

Also, last night I enjoyed playing ESO for the first time in a week. Didn't feel like just going through the motions. If I can get to the point where I feel content moving and tinkering, but also content reading or playing games, then I'm golden.

Well, I mean I'm not golden because I've still got a lot of demons to battle, but kratom never helped me with those demons- just made me forget them sometimes. Same with alcohol, same with hydrocodone. Fuck all that shit. Sometimes life hurts, but if I'm feeling it, then I'm truly alive, and there's gotta be hope to make things better somehow.",61

The reason I started taking Kratom is because after only 16 hours of sleep in 2 week at rehab I got out and need to find a way to sleep due to restless leg syndrome. Everytime I was about to fall asleep at rehab my legs would have a spasm and wake me back up. After 5 years of taking Kratom I figured it was time to try to quit. I use to take 1.5 Tsp every 3 to 4 hours 4 to 5 times per day. 9 days ago I started taking only 1 Tsp every 3 to 4 hours 4 to 5 times per day, cutting my dose my 1/3. The first 5 days or so I noticed that the hot and cold temperatures either outside or inside my home affected me similar to withdrawal but not to that scale. It was very manageable as long as I was staying active. Other than being more sensitive to temperature that was the only thing I noticed. Now I have to decide on how long to let my body adjust to the 1Tsp per dose every 3 to 4 hours. Should I do it for another week or 2 to let my body completely adapt so I can have minimal symptoms on the next faze or should I just right into the next faze. Next I need to decide what my next faze should be. Should I take 1Tsp ever 5 to 6 hours only 3 timer per day or should I take .75 or .5 Tsp every 3 to 4 hours like I am now time wise? Any thoughts or suggestions would be appreciated. Also if anyone has any advice on the restless leg syndrome that would be much appreciated as I know what I cut completely off or get close to cutting off I will have those symptoms again.

I have to tell myself that it‚Äôs possible to still get that kind of magic naturally. I just have to be patient and let my brain heal to where I enjoy the little things. Like truly get strong dopeamine hits without having to externally influence them. 

In order for that to happen tho, my brain and body need to get back to reality and realize that in order for that to happen, there must be periods of time where life is just normal. That‚Äôs kind of where I‚Äôm at.

I see by scrolling multiple of you have shared similar but they just don't come up in search results well. Chances are it will be the same here.

As I mentioned yesterday, yes I've been putting 14 to 50 GPD in my posts but when I first started making these I was really out of it and not caring. Truth is for maybe half a year or more it has been 50g a day average. Some from an online source I won't name per Reddit rules and some from a local shop that was surprisingly good. They simply bought online and weighed in front of you.

The first couple days were especially horrible. My drive to quit was primarily two reasons. One, I'm tired of always cleaning up the kratom mess. Two, I'm buddhist and my meditation is important to me. Kratom makes it impossible to actual focus on the level needed for the type I do.

Those days I couldnt eat. My legs were beyond restless. My back, neck and head hurt massively. Flu-like symptoms like crazy. Random puking of pure acid. Sleep was but a dream mostly. I was waking every hour, two max. For me withdrawal starts within 6 to 8 hours even when I constantly did lower doses.

Last night I laid down at my normal early time again. Actually got 6 hours straight of sleep. Mind you knowing how coming off kratom messes with my sleep I've been lying down around 4 to 5 pm. Woke up around midnight. Got out of bed around two and made a concentrated expensive matcha for the l-theanine and other goodies. Caffeine has no effect on me anymore.

I was able to snag almost 2 more hours of sleep after that. It was awesome!

I was hungry first thing this morning after multiple days of not eating or eating next to nothing. Grabbed some mcdonalds and ate until I was stuffed. Not typically my first choice but WTF. I needed something in me quick.

Actually able to stay awake during the day today while watching TV with the wife and kids. Prior days I was passing out repeatedly.

I'm hoping tomorrow I'm able to post back after a full night's sleep. Fingers crossed! If only this headache would go away! Back and neck as well as my legs are peachy now. Stomach still feels nauseous but not to the extent of puking meaning I was actually able to keep down food and fluids. Did take some loperamide today but not for what some people coming off of kratom do. Seems my body really wanted to get rid of that mcdonalds lol... took a normal amount.

Anyway, making these posts for other folks wondering what to expect.

5 days in and 50 times better 

Good luck!",5

I've lost 50 pounds, more than half of my hair, my health, and almost everyone reason I used to have to even wake up in the morning, with the exception of taking my next dose. I got duped majorly into believing that kratom was a relatively benign substance that I could quit at anytime with minimal discomfort.

I've never experienced something so physically and mentally hellish. I have responsibilities, a very important relationship, and a full time job that I have to maintain but at this point I'm wondering if cold turkey is the only way I'll be successful with kicking this.

I already admitted to my sponsor and accountability partners that I slipped, but came here right after.  

What got me was procrastination.  I've recognized it as a major issue for me but never really did anything about it.  I would save all my grad school assignments for the last day before theyre due and just stress over them until I finished them.  Well....this last time the stress became overbearing and I crumbled once the thought of ""one k shot will help me get through."" 

Naturally, out of habit, I bought 3 rather than just one. Once I committed to one, it was already too late to try and moderate any use.  So for three days I used 3 shots per day...and only the first day did I actually smash through homework.  The next two were in ""celebration"" of getting through major assignments. After all, I deserved it right?  Such a strange way the brain works, but it got me this time.  

I kept going back and forth in my head about continuing with my ""progress"" count of clean days through my support group, even convincing myself it was a slip not a relapse...but today (probably because I was finally thinking without kratoms influence) I decided to come clean.  

Today is now day 2, but I dont consider the last 5 months to be a waste.  They kept me from going longer than 3 days of using.  I am grateful for what sobriety has taught me, and once I handle this guilt and shame, I feel I can pick up where I left off, making adjustments to how I procrastinate as to not fall into this trap again.

I've been part of this group for over a year now, and I've been all over the place and debating if I should post. I've been waiting till I get to even 5 days to say ""Hey guys! Day 5 here, feeling better."" But, I can't seem to get there. I know I'm my own worst enemy, but idk what to do anymore..

So a little back round..

I was an addict prior to K, like most of us here, and had 5 years sober. During a bad divorce (was only married 3 months lmao that's a whole other story and it turned our for the better) I decided to go to my local Kava bar; which was literally 3 minutes away (I'm in South Florida, and there everywhere). I over time with going there everyday (bc I had no friends, still don't, and loved to socialize there as I made friends over time) started drinking a lot of Kratom. I realized about 5 months in when I started feeling shitty until I drank it that this shit causes withdrawals and is basically an opiate, but at the time I wasn't too worried about it. I met the man of my dreams at the bar (also an addict) and we ended up getting pregnant. I now have Olivia, my beautiful 18 month old, and the man I would make from scratch if I could make a partner (thank you universe).

While I was pregnant, I occasionally had a drink (please don't judge me) as it was so mentally hard for me to stay away.. see I've always struggled with feeling uncomfortable in my body, and I don't mean weight or stretchmarks or anything, I mean my OCD makes even seeing a pimple on SOMEONE ELSES face makes my cringe and feel dirty and overwhelmed and anxious (I don't know how to explain this feeling but I've always struggled with feeling gross in the human body).. so anyway, the pregnancy amplified it and I would have the occasional drink.. Then I had Olivia... so many changes at once was stressful (also got Melanoma cut out multiple times at 31 yrs old).. I started drinking it again everyday.. I was spending so much money I finally started buying the powder myself and I would make 100g at a time in a crockpot (the bars recipe) and me and my BF would split that over maybe 1-2 days.... so I was drinking anywhere from maybe 20-50gpd depending on the day. This went on for maybe 8-9 months or so.. Then I ""quit"" during quarantine last year. I quit the initial big doses.. but I didn't really quit because got to maaaybe 2 days then used, then 3 days, then used, then 2 again etc., etc.. This went on.. well until now and still going on. I don't make it anymore - I stopped that when I stopped the high dosage. I drink it again at the local bars.....

When I stopped the large amount, I can still remember the first day 3 I had  I felt the pink cloud and so appreciative to wake up and not need the shit (even though i was still sick), etc. I remember dancing around my apartment with my baby singing and feeling so proud. But I never after that fully got away from its claws.. the difference is now I don't come off of too much after a few day binger so I don't get the pink cloud or the gratitude, etc.

My issue is that there are literally Kava/Kratom bars 10 minutes away from me in any direction... and I'm like so drawn to it. I go out for lunch at work and it's right there.. I know most of you deal with the same thing in a different way - you go to get vape juice, and there are the caps and bags, etc., and you can still control yourself.. so I do feel like a whiny pussy.. but it just won't fn click for me man. I'm struggling so bad. The up and down emotions of 1-4 days on and at the most 2 days off for so long now is such a roller coaster of bullshit. I feel guilty when I drink it, then just sick enough (plus i hate my desk job) to say I'll just get a small drink to take the edge off. My BF is also in this with me - doing the same shit. We either help each other not do it or feed each others demons - we more so feed each others demons.. we both are sick of it.. the bickering when we drink it sometimes, the lack of sex drive, the poopin problems, etc... the MONEY. But my routine has been Friday night we get it, and Saturday.. then we say absolutely will not do it Sunday.. then Sunday comes and its just part of our routine. Then Monday I feel shitty at work but power through knowing that Tuesday is my 2 day off crutch day - meaning we get a ""baby"" which is like 4oz (maybe 3g idk? ) to take the edge off.. then day 3 comes and it's not too bad and sometimes we can get to Friday night.. this week hasn't been a good one... after my crutch Tuesday I broke yesterday and today felt bad so broke today again too. The highs and lows every other few days is killing me, and my chemicals in my brain.

It's getting so FN OLD! I feel so guilty and defeated and tortured by these demons. I wish I didn't feel euphoria anymore because that keeps me hooked. IDK what I'm looking to get out of this post.. I just have been wanting to post a positive one for so long to maybe get an ""Atta girl"" or some shit from some of the original people here who might remember me from last year.... But i guess if i can't post the positive one, I mine as well reach out and try to bring this struggle to the surface. I can't take my brain anymore.. it's killing me.

I thought I would reach out.  3 days ago today  I decided to take the big first step of recovery and dump all my Kratom out of its bags into the trash.  I put water on the nasty powder to ensure this is the end of my 6 to 7 year total dependency on Kratom.  I was just so tired of running out of the tested Kratom (for heavy metals and contaminants) that I bought online for a while and then I always had to turn to the crappy stuff you buy at the head shops which was even worse for my health.  Before I made the jump, I was taking a break time blend for a week that included hirsuta, javanica, and stem and vein.  I was at about 4 to 6.50 gpd before I quit that and made the jump to no mitragynas at all! For the real legit Kratom powder rather than the break time blend, I never used more than 15 GPD and I usually hovered around 9 to 12 GPD for a long time.  I was able to taper down to about 6.50 gpd of that before I switched over to the break time blend. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, It's been quite an internal battle of me believing it was helping me more than it was harming me.  Once I got sober I noticed that it was quite the contrary, I have gotten so accustomed to dosing Kratom everyday for a very long time.  But now I've been three days completely clean from Kratom and I gotta say that these withdrawals are bad.  I don't have any tremors or shakes, but I'm sneezing a lot, feel achey, fatigued, its hard to sleep without magnesium and ibuproven, and it's hard to stay motivated right now.  I know I'm a strong person and the people who know what i'm going through are rooting for me right now to stick to my plan.  I have no cravings of the powder sludge because I never wanna feel like this again and I don't want to be the person I was on Kratom either.  I know I'm in recovery right now and it's going to take a few more days to atleast get back to normalcy physically.  I just thought I would share my story that it is getting better slowly.  I'm happy to have my feelings back though, that's what i'm holding on to.  

&#x200B;

One thing I do remember from the last time I quit I started right back up again after a week or two of being off of it and overcoming all the negative withdrawal symptoms.  But this time I need to be strong and know that this, too, shall pass.  I have to keep in my mind that I refuse to go through this bs again and I know that will be enough to keep me away from it all.",8

So I finally completed my taper after trying and failing for nearly 8 months. Something completely changed in me a month ago. I‚Äôd been stuck at about 15gpd for months; down from 40+. I was getting ready to travel for my brothers wedding and found myself scrambling around town and my house ahead of time making sure that I had enough kratom to get me through the trip. And then, I found myself carrying enough capsules in my suit pocket to get me through the wedding day since I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have access to the capsule bottle for hours. I came home from that trip and was just like ‚Äúthis is fucking insane.‚Äù And then I rapidly tapered off the last 15gpd and have had 0 withdrawal symptoms, which blows my mind because I had such awful symptoms the last 2 times I briefly quit during and after the taper. With that said, I added clonidine to my arsenal this time around, whereas previously I only had clonazepam. I imagine that‚Äôs a big difference maker.

Anyway, I haven‚Äôt posted but a few times, but I appreciate everyone sharing their stories and advice, as it has helped me gain confidence over the months. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll struggle soon enough with PAWS and craving, but for now I‚Äôm celebrating a little bit. Thanks everyone!",8

Yesterday was my first day of tapering, I was able to cut down from 88gpd to 70gpd. I spaced my doses a little bit further apart to the point where I fell asleep before my pre bedtime dose after work, so was able to cut out an entire dose that way.

Fortunately I‚Äôm on a routine where I wake up at 7:30 every morning and start my day with strenuous weight training. It‚Äôs a good way to start my day off on the right foot, gets me feeling good and energized. 

Today, I decided I‚Äôm just going to focus on taking no more than 70g. Staying at this dosage while my body adjusts would be a victory in my book. I may even just drop just a tiny bit at a time each day before my next significant drop. I was just about to take my second dose of the day this morning, but decided to skip it and come to the beach for an hour and get some sun and salt water therapy. This will push my second dose of the day to about 12:30 pm, which is an hour later than my second dose yesterday, and 2 hours later than the day before.

Getting a scale has made me feel much more in control of my Kratom intake, and I‚Äôve been pre measuring each dose of the day each morning. 

So far so good. I know it‚Äôs going to get much more difficult from here on out, but we‚Äôre all in this together. Good luck to everyone on the path of quitting!",7

So I definitely stay under 10 gpd if not less than 5. I don't measure consistently, so I guess I could be off but when I have measured this is what it's always been like!

This past year I've been trying to get sober from alcohol off and on, (currently just reached 2 months sober!) Kratom and delta-8 THC gummies have honestly helped me so much in my sobriety, insomnia, anxiety, depression etc. But obviously I understand that kratom in particular carries risks for my mental and physical health and I'm genuinely tired of being dependent on anything so I'd like to stop using it. I just ran out of a huge bag of it that I bought last year, and I have a couple weeks of downtime so something inside me just decided the time to quit was now!

So I guess I'm just wondering--how do I find the motivation to quit something that I know is harmful in the long-run, but I'm not really taking that much of it nor am I experiencing any of the scary side-effects like I did with alcohol? Hangovers are a hell of a motivation. But with kratom, I think I fear that it's helping me more than it's hurting me especially with my mental health. Anyone else relating to this at all?? I just feel so torn! I just know this is something I need to do but I'm really scared. Above all I don't want to ruin my sobriety from alcohol.

Also--is it a guarantee I'll experience horrible withdrawals?? Since I'm not taking all that much? Thanks in advance for any advice to this poorly organized rant haha",5

So, needless to say, work was much tougher those days. I finally totally crashed and burned on the couch last night at around 6-7 P.M...didn't wake up until around 6 this morning lol. But for some reason, I had the most vivid and odd/random dreams last night, some involving people I have not seen or thought about much in years...

It was kinda surreal. In case your wondering, no, I have not completely stopped taking Kratom as of right now while I am sitting here typing this. I have, however, been attempting to taper down from about 40-50 GPD for the last 2 weeks or so. Not sure if it has been all that successful, really, as some days I'll feel accomplished for taking only about 25 G that day, only to foolishly for some reason go back to the original dose size the next day. Yes I know, that is completely senseless and beyond stupid, lol.

But I just wanted to share real quick how nice it was last night to actually 'feel' something again while I was dreaming...I felt joy, exhilaration, sadness, excitement, all the things that have been numbed for the better part of the last 6-7 years because of stupid opioids and Kratom. It was a subtle reminder and a small taste of what life was like and what I have been missing out on...

I have not had a dose since last night at about 5:30, and it is now 8:30 A.M. at the moment. Have yawned a couple times and have some slight sniffles, but nothing major. My wife asked me if I could clean the bathrooms as she went out the door to work about 30 minutes ago, and of course I obliged lol. There is 40 G of Kratom sitting up in the cabinet, and I want to just say screw this shit, I'm done and not even mess with it anymore. However, I know the classic WD symptoms we all know and love are gonna start creeping hard pretty soon here. Seriously conflicted right now...Was going to just take one dose and try and make it all day on that to begin a quick and hardcore taper. I am seriously so done with all this hindering madness and must stop altogether VERY soon...Sorry, long post lol but just wanted to share that this morning. There are much better things in life than this green bullcrap and we are all MUCH better off without it, no matter what the addict in us tries to convince us of...

You guys are all awesome and I love reading everyone's stories. Take care and enjoy your day(s)!",8

I'm still struggling with anxiety, low energy and overall crap feeling every so often. It feels like I have a couple of great days where I have a lot of energy and feel amazing, followed by a week of complete anxiety and depression. The kind where even going outside and crossing someone on the street gives me anxiety.   


This is crippling at times. I force myself through it, I still greet people and have talks when I meet someone I know on my regular dog walks. I can function, I can talk, I can form sentences, I don't feel ""dumb"", so people don't notice anything.   
But deep inside I feel dreadful. The whole fake it 'til you make it thing doesn't seem to work.

I've had a couple of weeks where I drank alcohol to numb the anxiety a little. It started with one drink, but ended up with multiple drinks every day for two weeks in a row. Great. Smartass.   
I successfully kicked that habit, luckily. But it wasn't without its own little withdrawal phase afterwards.

It feels like kratom made me bipolar in a way.  


I'm glad my girlfriend knows and supports me in every way. She says I'm doing great cause I've not taken Kratom since I quit, she says I'm on my way to completely being free of this crap.   


She's right. I can do this. We can do this. 

Here's to hoping this will pass soon. Thank everyone for this board, and the supportive messages and posts. This is a truly great community.

Have had the worst depression, anxiety and insomnia of my life so far and although I think I'm past the worst, the darkness is still so intense. So last night I had a traumatic experience. I'm not going to go into details but my significant other who I live with had a mental break that led them to be extremely verbally abusive to me, with moments of physical abuse too. It lasted for a while, until I was luckily able to get out and stay at a friends house, at which point I started receiving abusive calls and text messages for another few hours. The person I probably love most in this world was telling me whatever they could think of to hurt me as much as possible and I was just asking them to stop. It hurt really, really bad. This morning, I am very, very lucky that I got the support of my parents to get out of that living situation immediately. Im staying at a motel now. They did call and apologize and I was level and not mean, but I cannot stay in a situation now that could jeopardize what I need to do to be healthy. I had the money to buy kratom this morning and was within walking distance of three shops that sell it, but somehow, I didn't. I remembered that it would be so much worse after the kratom wore off. so much fucking worse. I have been smoking a ton of weed which im also really trying to quit, but I'm gonna try not to beat myself up about it. Probably the most emotionally intense and scary night of my life, during kratom withdrawals. but I didn't buy any. Thank god and thank you everyone on this sub.",49

I quit hard opiates about five years ago after putting myself in rehab. I‚Äôve dabbled a couple times but I knew it wasn‚Äôt worth it. About three years ago I found Kratom. I guess I used it on and off for about a year or so and then went on a family vacation and realized I really fucked up. All of the withdrawal symptoms hit me like a truck but it was long enough of a vacation that when I got home I was ready to get my life back. I started going back to NA, reconnected with an old rehab buddy and got to work. When 90 days rolled around I decided to ‚Äúcelebrate.‚Äù I believe that was January 3rd of 2020. I have used every day since until five days ago. 

I am a successful business owner, have a perfect family and a loving wife who I have kept in the dark. During the pandemic my usage went up to about 80 grams a day. I woke up one day with a dark cloud, totally depressed and it was all because of the fact that I had hit a year of every day use and I couldn‚Äôt stop. I started seeing a therapist who helped me taper down to about 10 grams. I didn‚Äôt like the therapist so stopped seeing her and went back up to about 40 GPD. I reconnected with the therapist I had for a year out of rehab and she suggested I see a psych so I took her advice.

This doc gave me all the helper meds I could ask for. Gabapentin, clonidine and Trazodone. Also I started an AD for the first time ever. That was about six weeks ago. I literally had the holy grail of detox meds and I was lying to my therapist and my psych doc and stayed at the 40 GPD. My guilt has been eating away at me. Why am I like this when I have everything anyone could ever ask for? I mean, what the fuck?!?

Anyway, I just went on a trip by myself to see my family and decided that this was going to be it. I told my sister what was going on and she helped me get to this point. My last dose was on the 21st and I can‚Äôt wait for the days to start moving fast. I‚Äôm never touching that shit again.

Anyways, thanks for all of your stories. They‚Äôve really helped.

TLDR? 80GPD for over a year. Tapered to 40. Day five. Never going back. Thank you all.",14

So I quit Kratom back in late August and I'm super proud of myself for doing so. I didn't encounter any physical withdrawals, but I went through psychological torment for the months following my departure from the sludge. I've kept in mind my reasons for quitting and remembered how reliant I felt to the drug and how much of my fucking MONEY it was eating up. This has helped me to stay off of it.

Around this time I was diagnosed with ADHD so a few months later I was given a prescription. I was pretty worried about becoming addicted to the ADHD meds, however I needed to graduate college and, with everything being online and me being stuck in my room, I was finding it almost impossible to get work done. That being said, in my approx. 7 months being prescribed, I haven't even entertained the idea of surpassing my prescribed dose. Honestly don't even really enjoy the ""high"" that it gives me but it has helped me to get things done that were previously impossible. 

As my experience quitting Kratom gets further and further away, I find myself forgetting the reasons that I quit to begin with. I've been thinking that I should stop using my prescribed meds and use Kratom instead (mainly because Kratom was a social booster for me, and my meds tend to make my lack of social ability worse at times). As I've graduated and am now going into the field, I've been thinking about how important networking is and how much I suck at it. I've been heavily considering getting back onto the sludge in order to make me more like-able to my new co-workers. 

It honestly sucks because part of me still believes that Kratom made me a more enjoyable person to be around and that the positives outweigh the negatives. But then I remember how like 9/10 of my daily thoughts were about the stuff, and how imprisoned I felt by it. But then I notice that once my obsession with Kratom passed, my attention moved to other things (TV Shows, meditation, landmarks, blah blah blah) and I've been getting to wonder if maybe my feeling of imprisonment by the shit has more to do with me than IT. I was working at a restaurant job at the time that I HATED and I felt I needed to take Kratom every day that I worked (which was often) in order to get through it. After I dumped the shit, I noticed that I was not even close to as socially successful as I was on it.... but then maybe that's just a problem with self esteem that Kratom erased for me. 

So pretty much, I've been trying to convince myself that I should get off of my prescribed meds and go back on Kratom in the wake of my career. Deep down I think it's just because I want that social euphoria again but idk. I feel that I might be using getting off of my meds as an excuse to get back on the substance that I truthfully love more.

Probably not gonna go through with it but low key considering going and getting one bag to access every now and again. Need some words of wisdom right about now.",7

I'm on Day 5, after about two and a half years of pretty consistent use; about 10gpd when i used powder, then when i moved back in September, I started picking up OPMS gold caps and used them for the past 6 or 7 months daily. Bad move! Idk what they put in those things but they're so much stronger. Also, just word to the wise, OPMS purports that they're 200mg per cap, but they are in fact 500+ when weighed on a mg scale.

I've taken week breaks before, but this is the worst my WD's have ever been. Restless body, chills and insomnia. Havent gotten more than probably 3 or 4 hours a day this week (i work nights and sleep during the day). The combination of sleep deprivation, symptoms and 5 back to back 12 hr shifts is really wearing on me. Last shift of the week tonight, fortunately.

Some positives: bowel habits are returning to normal, the kratom fog is fading, and i'm feeling more optimistic than i have in a while, despite the WD's.

Night before last was pretty bad sleep-wise. BTW my recent posts mention 14 to 50 grams per day. Truth is for months near the end it was around a steady 50.

I've been allotting 14 hours for sleep each night knowing how it would go. I'm on various anti-epileptics known for knocking people out, hydroxyzine, melatonin, valerian, some other crap. Woke every hour or two except for the final 4 hours or so I actually slept the whole time.

Pain levels were not as intense yesterday in the body but RLS, headaches and nausea were. I made myself eat a few eggs and pieces of bacon.

Last night was worse regarding sleep. I don't believe I got a solid hour at any point. Stayed in bed 14 hours again just to try to max out what I could. I'm at least not passing out on the couch as of yet like prior mornings. Luckily I work from home when I want. If not, no doubt I'd be fired.

Still super nauseous. Crazy chills. Headshop up the road calling my name but determined to stop. Too far in to turn back.

I feel beat but at this point I'm not super sure how much is directly withdrawal as opposed to the lack of sleep and tossing and turning.

2021-05-26 08:58:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nlgefc/kratom_is_an_addictive_drug/,Kratom Is An Addictive Drug,"Good morning. I stumbled across this subreddit months ago. I was still able to justify my kratom use even after reading the horror stories but finally had enough. It's been 23 hours since my last dose. I just wanted to give my story hoping that it would help others see that they've been lied to, deceived and manipulated into thinking this plant is ""harmless and safe"". As a matter of fact, reading the horror stories on this subreddit was the first step in my recovery...

I started taking it almost 3 years ago after hearing about it on... well, Reddit. They touted it is a miracle plant that had all the benefits of an opioid with none of the side effects. Mind you, I, like almost everyone else here, had already been through addiction and recovery before kratom. I spent 17 years as an active addict and had 7 years of sobriety. I just started a physically demanding job and caffeine wasn't cutting it anymore. Kratom turned me into superman. I was working circles around everyone, all day, everyday. I knew after my first dose that I had felt this feeling before; and, it was when I was popping percs and sets all day everyday for years and years. I knew the first time I took it that I had lost my sobriety, but my addictive personality was able to rationalize because of the misleading info about it on Reddit. 

After lurking in this subreddit for awhile, I realized I got off lucky. Because I knew what I was dealing with, I told myself that I would keep it in check and never, ever go over 20 grams in a single day. It was difficult to stay under this dose. Most days, especially after losing both of my grandparents, I wouldn't even measure my doses. 20, 30, 35 grams whatever. It didn't even seem to matter anyway. It didn't do what I wanted it to do. What I needed it to do. It would just make me feel sick. With it I felt like shit, without it I felt like shit. I knew what this meant. I knew what point I had gotten to and it was time to quit. 

The urinary issues are real. The stomach and GI discomfort is real. The withdrawal is real. Kratom is the only drug I've taken since I got sober over 9 years ago and I know what addiction and withdrawal looks like. If you're reading this and still questioning whether or not it's from the kratom, I can tell you that it is. I remember filtering it one day and seeing the bright green powder turn into a hard, rocky like clump. I realized right then and there that shit is going to fuck up my guts and GI tract. It's like eating dirt. Who TF wants to eat dirt? 

Oh, and I lost my hair too. 

The point of all of this is to hopefully inform someone else who has the sneaking suspicion that they were lied to about kratom being harmless with none of the drawbacks of your standard opioids. I'm reading about kratom users taking methodone and Suboxone to get off of it ffs. At one point I had actually contemplated getting a script of Vicodin to help ween me off of kratom. Can you believe that? 

Anyhoo... Yeah it's the kratom, homie. Don't be fooled. The shit is nasty. Just like everyone else has said: addiction creeps in unnoticed until it is all consuming one day seemingly out of the blue. 

I'm ready for the withdrawal. I want the withdrawal so I can put this bullshit behind me. Thanks to you guys, withdrawal will be a lot more tolerable this time around than my first time 9 years ago.",133

I'm here to say that I made it! 

I used my prescribed clonazepam and gabapentin for the first week for the physical WDs but now I am back to using those medications as needed for the reasons they're prescribed. I'm also still using marijuana to treat my pre existing depression, anxiety and bp but I'm not looking to quit that.

Now I'm just kind of trying to navigate through my emotions and the mental side of no longer having the kratom to numb my feelings over losing my dad. It's been extremely hard in comparison to the physical WD. But I do have days that I feel great all around.

On the good days I find myself playing with my kids more, crocheting, and doing art which I had stopped doing a lot of. I mentioned to my fiance that it's nice to have songs stuck in my head again also. Before the kratom I was a really sing songy type person and that is coming back as well, and my son thinks it's hilarious.

I came here often when I was beginning my journey so I could soak up support in the form of knowing that I wasn't alone and that quitting is possible...and I want to be that post for others that are starting off and scared. 

We all can and will break free from the clutches this horrid drug has lured us into. I'm always a message or comment away if anybody just needs to talk or vent because I think it's important for us all to love and support one another.

I woke up at 6am today and I feel like that natural motivation is coming back again, plus I am more organised with my work now and I am not forgetting things.

Kratom made me feel like a dope, it really screws up your intelligence.

Music feels better now, emotions are coming back.

The hardest part is when memories come up of things you are ashamed of in the past and having to process those, but I just remind myself that a lot of that wasn't my fault, we are born into bad situations and when we are young we don't know any better.

I feel like I've had a pretty mild withdrawl so far, however the past 4 weeks while taking kratom I have been very depressed, I think this was a blessing.

When you have taken drugs since being 15-16 it feels weird now at 35 nearly 36 to be sober, but I can tell that it is the best place to be if you want to get things done in life, can't run from your self for ever.

The insomnia has been awful (like 2-3 hours a night with one night of absolutely 0 sleep), and after trying ambien pretty unsuccessfully my doctor gave me seroquel 50mg. Took half of it last night and was out for 4.5 hours, woke up and took the other half and went back to sleep for another 3, which was honestly a godsend. I also hear that it really works for some people with major depression/bipolar disorder's depressive episodes, so maybe it will aid in my hopelessness. I did have a moment today where I appreciated the beauty of some trees around my house in a way I definitely couldn't have a few days ago. But its still really bad.

Had enough of that disgusting drink that I‚Äôd force down twice a day, often resulting in some crazy burps and occasionally throwing up. Honestly I felt next to nothing when I took K, nothing like at first when an 8 gram bag had me feeling good. Used to take Percocet 30‚Äôs, but never got into it daily, never done H or the other hard opiates. Kratom definitely helped me kick that, but at one point a year and a half ago I started back up again with the percs and went down the rabbit hole quick. After a few months of percs 3x per week I said fuck this, but continued with kratom. Symptoms from quitting Kratom CT/no taper were not nearly as bad as I thought they‚Äôd be. Maybe I‚Äôm not out of the woods yet... still dealing with some sleep issues, but the RLS seems to have subsided. Other than that, virtually no other WD symptoms thus far. Whenever I think about kratom I just remind myself how disgusting it is. I‚Äôve tried kava for the second time now, but honestly don‚Äôt feel anything. 2 or 3 nights I‚Äôve used an indica vape in the late evening. I‚Äôve had 2 beers on 2 occasions as well, which I know I shouldn‚Äôt do. I‚Äôve stayed extremely active, walking between 6 & 12 miles per day. This has been a huge factor I believe in easing WD.

But man, coming out of the lazy River, I‚Äôm bored. I lost my job a couple months ago, and it‚Äôs insane just how much time I‚Äôve spent just laying in bed. I‚Äôve fucked up a lot but I am being aggressive every single day with not dosing except once for sleep, as a crutch so I can get used to living sober. 

I‚Äôve spent so much time fucking iff doing nothing, because kratom gives you such a contentment you feel fine doing nothing, scrolling etc

Once you get through the week of agony, you need to learn how to love life again. Go hang out with people, eat some good food, stretch and exercise, make yourself some tea, go read outside, sauna, shower, clean and get out of your house, go walk your dog. You have bombarded your body with constant stimulation, try to transfer the stimulation into healthier forms and then you can start restricting and fasting even for that

It was almost a necessity for me to not have a job during the acutes. Like I said I‚Äôve fucked up enough that I have signed up for another round of acutes but they are much more manageable now. Now that I‚Äôm passed that though, the boredom is very real, and I definitely need a job not just for money but to beat boredom now that I‚Äôve finished all my home projects.

I hope this helps you out. Remember you‚Äôve been on a hedonic treadmill, you need to learn how to enjoy things without opioid highs. You lose all of your joy for music, and the taste of tobacco and food, and the aggression, and just become comfortably numb.

Hi,

I was wondering whether I should try taking Wellbutrin to help with PAWS? 

The longest I quit for was about 18 days and the PAWS was still pretty rough at that point. I know it takes a lot longer to feel better but maybe the Wellbutrin( Bupropion) could help me start feeling better and I could use it for 3-6 months to help me get through PAWS.  I feel like it might help me function more normally and allow me to build better habits like socializing, exercising, etc. Every time I quit I kind of want to isolate myself because the PAWS makes me awkward and antisocial. 

The only thing I‚Äôm afraid of is that my brain won‚Äôt recover properly if I take the Wellbutrin and I end up becoming dependent on it. Is it better to allow my dopamine receptors to heal naturally?

Does anybody have any experience with Wellbutrin for withdrawals? Also were you able to quit the Wellbutrin after a few months and feel normal again? 

Thank you!",4

No cravings, yet, but I‚Äôve been here before with other substances so I signed up for SMART recovery and informed my therapist who I was seeing for other issues and have formed a plan of attack. I was so disgusted with myself while I was using, constantly lying and hiding, and I wanted to quit for such a long time but never had the will power until I got caught by my partner. I knew I had to quit for myself, but I don‚Äôt think I had the strength to start. Blessing in disguise that they found it perhaps. 

I have some underlying health conditions that, while not affecting me yet, present a very real possibility to handicap me in my late 50s/early 60s. As a result, we changed a good amount of our lives to give me a better chance. Completely changed our diet and eating habits, increased exercise, made a real effort to make the lifestyle changes now that will give me a better shot in the future. My partner was more than willing to make those changes with me, and understandably felt betrayed when they learned I was doing something that could negatively impact my health behind their back. 

Fortunately, we have remained together for the time being (not out of the woods yet). I did everything I could to immediately show them I wanted help and needed help but was terrified to ask for help. I closed all my other accounts and made sure to tell them I am an open book. Trust issues remain, and I don‚Äôt blame them for that, but we‚Äôve started to build back our relationship. I was taking pretty small doses comparatively, and really enjoyed it for the energy and anxiety reduction. I think showing them that the ‚Äúme‚Äù they enjoyed being with was the real ‚Äúme‚Äù and the unpleasant version was not has been huge. I hope I can continue to grow into the person I want to be, and am willing to put in the effort. 

I have miles and miles to go, but life is a marathon as it is. I hope anybody that is struggling with addiction and is worried about support finds the strength to ask for help. You don‚Äôt need to do this alone, no matter what your circumstances are. Outpatient is an option for those who can‚Äôt take time off from work or life.

I‚Äôm HORRIFIED of what would happen if I ever ran out of this stuff. I once worked a 6 hour shift while dealing with withdrawals, haven‚Äôt gone a day without Kratom since then. That was 4 years ago, and my addiction has gotten much worse since then.

I am going on a trip to Yosemite with my family in September, and just knowing I‚Äôd have to deal with the stress of finding ways to dose during the trip over there has made me want to quit, or at least drastically cut back by then.

I bought a scale yesterday and have just been trying to get a feel for how much I take per dose and how many times per day, and it looks like I average about 15-17 grams per dose about 6 times per day. I did a little test run Yesterday, lowering my doses to 13 grams each. I stuck to a normal dosing schedule throughout the day, but at night I ended up taking a second dose after only an hour and a half from my first nighttime dose. I think I may have dropped a little too aggressively due to underestimating my daily intake. I think for the rest of this week, I will limit myself to 15grams per dose, and then lower it to 14 next week.

If anyone has an experience with successfully tapering off such a serious Kratom habit, I‚Äôd love to hear what worked for you. My goal is to taper off while functioning as normally as possible. Any help would be greatly appreciated!",3

He apologized saying that he would be out for a couple weeks. Of course I told him that this is no different from any other illness that would prevent him from working and that he has my full support. 

I heard of Kratom a little bit in the past, but today I‚Äôve been researching like crazy to try and understand ways to help him through this time. I want to get him a care package from myself and the rest of the staff but I‚Äôm not sure what to get him. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking:

- Notes of encouragement
- Pepto to help with diarrhea/nausea 
- Melatonin to help with sleep
- Gatorade/Powerade (something to help with hydration)
- Teas (Green and Chamomile)
- A silly book and toy that he will like 
- Food delivery gift card (Grubhub or whatever)

Is there anything I‚Äôm missing? Should I avoid any of these items for some reason? Any advice and suggestions are welcome!

I got introduced to K about 5 years ago and Surprisingly didn‚Äôt go full blown addict at first only taking it once or twice a week for several months. Everything changed once I learned how to obtain K for myself via online. I was like the frog in boiling water; one day a week turned into 3 and then 5 and then it was everyday after work. 

Then one day I took it before work and that became and everyday habit (for the boundless energy. I was in a very good place in my life at the time, I used the energy from K to teach myself
Python programming and my career elevated rapidly so I didn‚Äôt think I had any sort of problem. Eventually I moved from the west coast to the east coast with my GF so she could go to grad school. That‚Äôs when I really started to realize how deep I was into the muck and mire. I was secretly dosing the whole cross country journey and I just couldn‚Äôt stop once we got out to the state we had moved to. I worked remotely for the first 6 months and was home all day by myself just slamming K like there was no tomorrow . My habit got up to 15g 3 times a day and on the weekends when my GF was around I of course did what addicts do and I snuck it in the bathroom tossing and washing. So much shame and of course I got caught. 

More than once in fact. It took the 4th time getting caught to promise that I would finally quit. I could see the pain in my GFs eyes.

And I did, for a couple of months. Things were going great I had started a new job and we were happy again and I was the best man in 2 friends weddings. Then something happened so insanely impulsive I don‚Äôt even know what caused it . I decided ya know what good things happened to me on K. I can control it this time but I have to keep it a secret . So what did I do? I got a PO Box right near my place of work and had it sent there and then. I started dosing at work; morning , afternoon and end of day. She would never find out this way. And she never did. 

It went on like this for a couple of years and then when the pandemic hit I had to change up my addict routine so I got the capsules and stashed them around the house and lived that way the whole pandemic. This last year has been miserable I wanted to quit so bad. 

I knew it had wrecked my sexual drive , turned me into zombie where all I did was play video games and await the next dose.

I finally had my breaking point one night . I had just moved back to the west coast and I broke down late at night all alone as my GF was still back on the east coast. I welled up thinking about all the terrible things I‚Äôd done over the past 3 years all in secret. Excuses for everything just to get that high. I was intoxicated on kratom and still the emotion poured out like a faucet. I wrote myself a letter to my future self detailing everything I‚Äôd done and why it was finally time. I read it the next day and I haven‚Äôt looked back. quit 9 days ago and I‚Äôve never felt better. 

I know this is super long but it‚Äôs been a long time coming. I stilll have some bumps and bruises but I‚Äôm excited for the new future without K. Today I even went to a gas station where they selll K and I didn‚Äôt even think twice about buying.

I've recently became aware of my rapid Kratom use that needs to stop. I've used up to 50gpd, but then got Kratom from another supplier and it's now closer to 30-35gpd.

I can't really take the time off to do CT, so I was thinking of this ""taper"" schedule:
I stop taking it, and only take a spoon after it becomes too miserable (or before sleep for example). Would that work?
I read a lot of posts, but didn't see much about doing it this way. 

So it'd be a combination of CT and tapering I guess?

I feel like I am beginning to get that child-like curiosity for life back. I can't remember the last time I felt like this. Yesterday I took my wife and my son to hangout at a popular spot by the river. There were a bunch of teenagers jumping off a small cliff into the deep part of the water, and I said screw it, I'm jumping. I had a bunch of high school kids cheering me on to jump. I jumped in and the water was incredibly cold, but I have been taking cold showers and practicing Wim Hof breathing, and stayed in the water fully submersed up to my neck and meditated while my body adjusted, then began to feel warm and I started to feel a rush of euphoria. 

This seems like a silly little story, but I think I conquered something within myself. I've been to this river several times on kratom and could never be bothered to swim in some cold ass water, forget jumping off the cliff. This got me thinking about how many great opportunities to feel joy that didn't even register to me while living I was in a haze. Now I know it's possible to experience these feeling without putting mind-altering chemicals in my body. 

As for today, I haven't thought much about Kratom at all. I haven't taken any helper meds either. Sleep is beginning to improve as well. I'm not at a full 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep or anything, but I feel that I will get there eventually.

Anyways, for all you quitters, keep at it. When you use your vision is clouded and you miss out on so many great opportunities to feel joy. Step out of your comfort zone. Remember that child-like curiosity that you had as a kid and act on it. This garbage is so insidious the way wrecks havoc on your mental and emotional well being, and you don't even realize it until you wasted way too much of life's most precious resource: time",7

I need input please,"I was originally on a 60+GPD habit for a little over a year. About two months ago I decided that my wallet had enough of this and I needed to quit. I would become irritable if not on enough kratom, and it was honestly an embarrassment. I decided to start by tapering, as I know that I am not a very strong willed person. I was taking a dose every 2 hours, while every two weeks tapering down 1 gram. I felt like everything was going fine until it was time to go under 3 grams per dose. I made the mistake of measuring out my doses from my big bag (honestly I forgot this is no-no. And I now obviously see why) It was hard. I just couldn't get myself to to do it, so then I decided maybe it was time to just Cold Turkey. Saturday was when I started and I have already fallen off the wagon. I have done every opiate under the sun, and nothing has ever been this hard. The PAWS felt insanely intense and I almost felt like I was in the scene from train spotting. I am seriously surprised kratom can have such intense withdrawals. 

The thing is, I'm trying to decide on how to taper again. I just don't have the strength to CT this stuff. I was thinking of starting at 5 grams 4 times a day. I will have these already measured out, but how do I move forwards from there? Is it better to taper the amount down by half a gram as opposed to a full gram? How much time is too much time in-between dose drops? How much time is too little? 

Does anyone have any good schedules for dietary supplements? I am very interested in trying  Ashwagandha, I would love to hear any suggestions or experiences.

I am so upset with how hard this has been, and I really would like to set myself up for success. After my failed CT I feel more lost than ever, any advice and help would be a world of help and very welcomed. Thank you so much for reading this if you made it this far, I appreciate all of you.",8

This post isn't as much as a piece of advice, but something that has helped me and may help some of you. I took a trip down to Idaho to go camping. Not once did I think about kratom which was incredibly rare for me to do. As soon as I got back, the urges started again. It was the context I was in that I think contributed to my Kratom urges.

90% of my kratom usage happened here at my home on the computer, watching tv, or studying. The boredom is what does it too. Home is a trigger for me to use and that makes it a hard trigger to overcome. There is a lake/large pond I live close to with lots of wildlife. In my strongest urges, I will go down to that lake/pond and sit there for as long as it takes for my mind to go at ease. Then I will go do something else instead of being at home even if its just shopping for a while. It works, it takes my mind off of using. 

So, if I were to offer advice from my personal experiences, it would be to recognize your triggers, and separate yourself from those triggers when it gets bad.",18

Day 7 is odd, I really don't feel too bad, I might even say that I feel good. Not really 100% yet, but I feel more like myself than I have in years. This has been a rough ass week, but feeling the Kfog lifting is incredible. I'm a musician, and the entire time I was on K I slowly lost interest in music. So to hear music like I haven't heard it 3.5 years is almost intoxicating itself. Sex is better. I don't last as long as I used to, but it seems like a common problem, and luckily my wife has been super supportive through this whole process. If there's anyone out there considering quitting, and you're reading this right now, just quit. It is undoubtedly going to suck. Maybe more than you're even prepared to deal with. But to see the world with new hopeful eyes is a great feeling, one that the K could never compare to. The advice I've received on here that has been a lifesaver revolves around 3 supplements, Black Seed Oil, Vitamin C-Sodium Ascorbate, and Magnesium. These will help ease the physical affects, along with some clean eating and exercise. Mentally, it's important to keep yourself focused on your goal, and distract yourself in whatever way you prefer. Work, hobbies, video games, tv/movies, arts of any kind, etc. Just distract, distract, distract. If you have kids, this part is probably going to be taken care of for you lol.

It‚Äôs unlike anything I‚Äôve ever taken. From previous posts, I‚Äôve explained that I only took 1g a day for 2 months, but I also have a history of kratom abuse (5 years at 30-40gpd). I guess it‚Äôs the rekindling that makes it harder this time. 

The rekindling is no joke guys. This should have been a lot easier than it is. I thought taking that much less would have made this easier, but it has not lol 

The psychological toll this time is harder for some bizarre reason. I find myself extremely anxious one moment, to depressed, to really happy. I‚Äôm all over the map. As far as acutes go, I still feel achy in my back and the classic symptoms on a very mild level. I think what makes kratom so hard is the mental aspect. There‚Äôs this weird depersonalization that happens, a melancholy darkness you feel and it‚Äôs like emptiness inside. Like nothing will ever be okay and that the world is cold. Morale is low lol

I know I sound dramatic and also that it passes, but please understand that once you get off kratom, touching it again will not solve your problems (it will indefinitely create bigger problems). Most people probably wouldn‚Äôt go through this if they started on such a small dose, but I believe the abuse I inflicted on myself is responsible for this. I also believe that since I got off of kratom for 4-5 months prior to this, it‚Äôs more painful knowing it could have been avoided. I‚Äôm angry with myself and tired of putting myself through self-sabotage.

There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind now that I can‚Äôt take this substance anymore. I‚Äôm afraid of it now and the toll it‚Äôs taken on me so far. This is probably the worst of it though (such a small dose can‚Äôt possibly take much longer). Sorry for the rant, but last time I wasn‚Äôt as upfront about the bad times and I think that‚Äôs what has led me back to this point.

I‚Äôm usually athletic and strong but had symptoms of low T during the stretch. 

It was like I had no personality at all. It went beyond general anhedonia to where I was almost moved by nothing at all. There was no will. It is hard to explain. I could also not think for an extended period of time, and would wake up in the middle of the night with horrible panic attacks. Y‚Äôall know what I‚Äôm talking about. 

I have never had those symptoms persist for that long at that severity. I thought I had maybe caused some permanent damage. Thank God all that seems to be behind me.

For a quick snapshot background - 

32/F. I started tapering my kratom use (up to 50GPD, 5-6 years) & made changes in my day-to-day in October 2020 after realizing seemingly overnight what a number I‚Äôd done to my hair. I officially quit using kratom on Feb 6, 2021.

This post is for anyone using kratom & dealing with hairloss. I am happy to report that things are looking up! 

I had been hopeful for awhile (seeing baby hairs sprout up & shedding get lighter over the months) but looking at your hair every day is like watching grass grow- compared to yesterday can you really tell a difference? It wasn‚Äôt until I found pictures from Oct/Nov 2020 when things were at their worst that I noticed things are surely improving.

To give you a visual - my hairloss is primarily on the top & front of my head. I am fortunate to have swoopy side bangs to cover most of the damage, but back in Oct if I would lift that hair up you could pretty easily see the outline of the top of my head & maybe 1-2 inches into my hair bc it was so thin (a jarring sight). Things are not 100% where they were by any means but the outline of my head is definitely fading and baby hairs are sprouting while others are advancing toddler hairs & dare I say it maybe some pre-teen hairs as well. My part is looking better too.

I still have a ways to go but I am finally at a point where I feel more free letting my hair be natural (rather than pinned/covered) when leaving the house. I still rock headbands/pin it if I am going to be out for a long period of time.

I did everything I could think of to address this. I can‚Äôt say 100% which routine worked, but I can tell you that doing all of them - and telling myself I was doing all that I can to address the situation - and then throwing my hands in the air & laying down at the mercy of time & recovery and putting my fate in that was the best decision I made. I know that is easier said than done but once you accept that all you can do is all you can do and commit to doing it...I felt 20lbs lighter. I have no doubt freeing myself of the stress of worrying every day if things will get better - and just accepting I‚Äôm doing all I can think of and only time will tell - has been aiding my recovery.

I am about 3.5 months into my quit but the real noticeable change is from looking at myself 7-8 months ago. I think recovery for me started before I officially made the jump but quitting is one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made for myself. If I compared myself now to pics from 3 months ago the improvement wouldn‚Äôt have been so noticeable; I probably wouldn‚Äôt be making this post. But the girl from 8 months ago? Well I am kicking her ass in the looks department. So don‚Äôt get too hung up on timelines. The fact that I have been able to undo even a fraction of the damage I caused in over 5 years time in just 8 months is remarkable to me. And hopefully in the coming months I‚Äôll have even better news.

Stay well!",31

I'll keep this one nice and short compared to that. I've some ""sleep meds"" which are rather weak. Just hydroxyzine and supplements. Hydroxyzine is like a stronger version of benadryl that doesn't leave you feeling as crappy.

Ate nothing yesterday aside from my meds including a massive amount of nausea medication (zofran). Had to keep taking Hydroxyzine last night to get any sleep whatsoever.

Half a decade of at least 2 7g doses minus about 3.5 months I'd quit before and should have remained as such.

I primarily use kratom for headaches and stomach pain/problems.

Long-story-short, with a very specific sleep schedule my headaches and epilepsy are bearable.I've done keto for my epilepsy. My meds hardly work. On that, it helped the epilepsy and my stomach pains & the runs went to next to nothing. Seems grains and such really bother me. Keto for epilepsy you can google if you care or keto in general (there's a lot of BS be warned).

I like to meditate. An old-school buddhist meditation. If it weren't for this I'd stay on kratom. Kratom makes my thoughts bounce around too much to succeed in this meditation. I may as well hop off my cushions, lie in bed with my eyes shut and simply just think about random crap.

I've tried googling this including with the ""site:reddit.com"" ""google dork"" and only found posts about insomnia. I've the opposite problem - I cannot stay awake unless I am actively typing, showering, washing dishes, etc ... If I sit to watch cartoons with the children, shows with the wife before she leaves for work or simply take a break in between work stuff (I work at home - software engineer, pen-tester, so on) I just keep falling asleep until my wife or one of my kids finally snaps me out of it after a half-dozen tries.

I'm sure most of you aren't too familiar with epilepsy so to keep it simple, this is very detrimental for my health. I've a long lasting (24-72 hours) ""emergency medication"" of which I took some this morning knowing how today would be. I only get so many a month. I don't want to keep using them in anticipation when not needed so trying to get a general idea here.

I don't know why I started again. It DID help me get off of worse substances that cost me multitudes more a day than this does a month but I should have stayed off while I was off..

Falling asleep aside, I've a massive headache. My neck and back are killing me. I love the winter and cooler temperatures like 60F or so max but have the furnace going at 80F+ to fight the chills. Hard time staying out of the bathroom. I know if I eat I'll puke.

For comparison, I've quit ""worse"" things I did daily for years and never had this reaction. I'm not sure why kratom does this to me every time I aim to stop. I could get more but won't. This is day 2 after an average of 14g/day split amongst 2 7g doses but admittedly some days would spike to between 30-50g. Yes, I'm well aware that's a lot. I don't wish to go into detail about the other substances but my usage was extremely high and switching required a lot of kratom. I have to go over other posts here to see exactly how extreme that is but I know from other subs it definitely isn't unheard of.

I know from the past however it's not just the amount but rather frequency that plays into the crappiness that comes with stopping. I've been taking this half a decade starting with 7g a day then quickly switching to 14g.

Figured I'd ask my question but also share a bit of my background with this substance.

Good luck to you all!",3

Today I've reached that 14 day mark. Up until yesterday, I have been absolutely stoked about the daily progress that I have been making. Pushing and fighting through all the physical, mental and dull moments to reach the next day. It has been challenging but doable, I've been taking all suggestions given to me. Vitamins, walks, runs, gym, keeping busy, etc. All have been helpful and have definitly gotten me to this point. The most important piece of that puzzle has been checking into here. Talking to all those on here on this similar journey and relying on each other's strengths, words of encouragement and social pushes to get through life without K.

I say up until yesterday because I've had this overwhelming feeling of ""missing something."" Yesterday I entertained the thought of drinking more then I cared to. I attempted to convince myself that I could have a few or that I could figure out a way to manage it better then last. I even Googled it to see if it is possible for someone with a using problem to control there drinking. I know this is sub about kicking and staying clean from K but I wanted to share the temptation of me drinking because this is how the disease works. It tries to creep in and get you to move on to the next ""thing."" Then when it has you, it dogs its claws into you and the patterns of the past come back full force and all the same consequences emerge. I know this because I have been down this road, many times, woth many different substances. (Including alcohol)

I did not use, I kept pushing it off, I shared my feelings with my wife and friends on here. I prayed and I reflected on my past, where I've come from and where I'm at. I thought of life, my goals, my wants, my desires. I know their is a life out there without substances. 

So today I continue to tell on my thoughts, my feelings of emptiness and thoughts of using. Even thought things are getting better, and I mean better compared to days 1-5. I'm still human, I still suffer from a disease and I still have to be accountable to my vulnerability. I surely look forward to that feeling of ""freedom."" The days where using don't cross my mind as much or as hard. I'm looking forward to a life without anything. I've been there before, I can be there again.

I'm going several days between thinking about K at this point. Sometimes I forget why it was so good or so bad. I thought it was so good because each dose gave me about 60 minutes of feeling powerful and energized and ready to go. But then I felt shitty, anxious, rage-y, and I had to dose throughout the day to have a chance at chasing that first high of the day. 

I didn't realize how fucking awful it made me feel until after I quit. I didn't realize it was K robbing me of sleep every night, making everything in my body hurt, giving me awful migraines several days a week. 

I've not had any cravings recently. Those first few weeks were an absolute bitch but I'm so glad I pushed through to make it to now. The only time I think about K is when I think about my brothers and sisters and gender non specific siblings on this sub who are in the process of quitting!!

When this whole thing started a little over a year ago, I was just coming to about 3 months clean (maybe 4)... And all of a sudden, no more travel, no more leaving the house, and no socializing. For someone who suffers with anxiety it seemed like a blessing. Finally I can stay home and won't have to travel and won't need any excuses to avoid social situations. Perfect. Well with that came back the old feelings of anhedonia and depression. I wasn't anxious, but bored to death. I tried drinking alcohol (bad idea)... I looked to buy some kratom online, but didn't feel like trying to sneak some via mail. Then I learned that the smoke shop isn't closed down and the rest of the year I spent with as much kratom as my heart desired. I felt perfect. No anxiety and no boredom just laying down watching TV or typing or sorta working from home. I became extremely lazy, but I felt ok. You know that comfortable misery.

10 days post taper and I feel like this has been a bad dream. I have lost all my friends, barely talk to my wife, barely functional. Terrified of getting the vaccine, terrified of leaving the house. I honestly don't remember the last time I was so depressed and anxious at the same time. In my mind I'm ready to travel and have fun and enjoy life, and then I realize that I'm still in withdrawal, still have to get vaccinated and still have to strength to do much other than go for a walk. It takes time and lots of patience. The ups and downs early in recovery are very real and very painful. Hard to believe I've wasted another year.",16

I will try and summarize my story as best as I can. It's a long one, and I recently lost my dad so words are still hard. It's important for me to try and spread some hope though, especially if there is anyone like me that feels like they will be stuck on this shit forever. 

My kratom story goes back to 2016. I have struggled with opiate addiction and found myself on Suboxone and needing to wean off myself. You know how that story went. Enter Kratom, the new thing back then that everyone was talking about as this cure for addiction, pain relief, and it was safe. It would help with intense opiate withdrawals and I could eventually stop because it was as safe as coffee. Right? Many of us have heard that BS. That's what sold me. 

I also had to taper benzos. The kratom helped with those symptoms too. One huge problem was that I was being prescribed a super high dose of benzos and i would find myself tapering off for the next few years. I stayed on the kratom because every time I tried to stop it or taper off, I would get suicidal. Like I have never been before in my life. The kratom was keeping me more stable and I felt just totally fucked and stuck. 

Fast forward to 2020 and I got cancer. I needed surgery. Opiates were needed. It messed me up a little more and I kept taking small amounts of kratom. I weaned down to taking only 5 grams a day. This year I ordered capsules and got down to 1 capsule daily. A month ago I bought a new scale to get off the final 2 mg of Valium (from 60 mg starting benzo dose). I was weighing stuff for fun and I decided to weigh a kratom capsule to see how much I was even taking. It was .87 grams. That's it. I jumped a few days later. I had zero symptoms the first week. Day 8 I felt like shit for a few days. I'm now at day 20 and have no symptoms. 

I don't know if I will have more symptoms. I'm hoping not obviously. I just hope that my story helps someone that feels stuck. I honestly believed my brain was going to be hooked on this green sludge for at least another few years. The freedom feels amazing. If I can do it through addiction, a cancer diagnosis, and the death of my dad, YOU CAN TOO! ‚ù§Ô∏è",26

I'm in that period now where the physical symptoms have abated but the mental stuff is still going strong.

When I was using it, I was doing 2-3 extract shots a day, which I bought from the bodega near my apartment. When I decided to quit, I also decided to just stop going to that bodega and go to one a couple blocks away instead. No big deal, right?

Except this morning, we're out of ice (due to some bad planning on our part) and I have to go get a bag. It's early Sunday morning, so the place I would usually go hasn't opened yet. My old bodega, though, is 24 hours. 

Maybe I shouldn't have, but I decided I needed to test my will. As I walked up to the counter, the guy there had already pulled a shot off the shelf and rung it up for me. It took less will than I expected to say ""no, just this today.""

I had nightmares last night about driving a Ford pickup in snowy weather and getting into impossible and deadly situations. Still had some sweats, but the worst part last night was the RLS.

Life is a cruel joke when you think about it. The brain can release a chemical specifically to make us happy, but it's designed to be very stingy with it. Then if you trick it into releasing too much, it can really mess with you or even kill you. So you keep trying different things, but always end up having to quit. Then in the periods in between, you hope that if you walk far enough, or work hard enough, or meet enough people, that you'll be happy, but you're not, and the chemical that makes you unhappy is deadly too, but you can live a lot longer with it out of wack, and meanwhile your life is so shit that all you can think is how can you fix it, but you know it's a fool's errand.

But theres no point in giving up either because then you know you'll never be happy. That pretty much seals the deal.",13

After finishing my studies and being ready to start a new lifes chapter, my mother commited suicide and this whole Corona situation started.

Instant ""I can't deal with this, I have to numb myself"" reflex.

Fast forward one year: What made me quit is that my mental health really started to decline rapidly these last few months, and even Kratom couldn't hide this fact. Sleeping problems, depression, feeling of emptiness, extreme brainfog, stress, guilt, not being able to connect with people, underperforming at work... You name it. Tapered down to 6 g.p.d and jumped after a few weeks.

I really hope things will get better in the near future. I'm also on the waiting list for counceling right now, so yeah... Time to deal with some stuff I pushed away for far too long. Quite depressed right now (but I also was this most of the time even with using Kratom lol), had a little mental breakdown yesterday, anxious about the future, ...

It's been a while since I posted on here. I felt like I owed it to this sub and myself to check in. I was on this stuff for more than 4 years (about 50-75 gpd). I never thought I would quit. I honestly thought I would be on this s**t for the rest of my life and I accepted it. I quit when  the quarantine happened and was out of work, knowing this was THE opportunity I was waiting for and I had to take advantage of it.

Anyway, I did it. I stuck to it. I haven't waivered in over a year and I am so proud of myself. I'm not going to sugar coat anything though, it's been the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. The initial withdrawals sucked, but they were NOTHING compared to the excuriating PAWS I felt for months after months after. If it weren't for this sub I would have lost my damn mind. Healing and feeling better wasn't  linear for me. I had good and bad days. I was exhausted, depressed, suicidal at times, but there were gilmpses of pure Bliss and how wonderful the world is and how grateful I was to be sober.

I can't say that today everything is perfect,  because that is not the case for me. Yes, I feel more clear headed, smarter, sharper, but I still struggle with being an addict every day. I am trying struggling with being a sober person and not using a crutch, but damn it's hard. My best advice to anyone here would be please, please, please try to taper. I quit CT and it was a traumatizing experience. Do whatever you can to taper and do this gradually. CTing off this stuff and dealing with PAWS for so long almost broke me.

My other piece of advice would be to seek help from an addiction counselor or psychiatrist after you've quit.If you are prone to addiction, it's not as simple as quitting one substance. You have to get to the core of why you are an addict or you won't be successful. I am still working on this, but just know that there is always hope. You can do this if you have the will. If it weren't for this sub, I never would have made it. Thank you so much for being here. I have so much respect and love for you all ‚ù§Ô∏è Sorry for the long post, but I had to get it out.

So, I quit a 4 year, 20-30g/day kratom habit CT back in January. I also quit nicotine a few weeks prior to quitting kratom. I had been doing alright, up until I moved at the beginning of April. Since then, I have been experiencing some intense depression. I have struggled with depression in the past, but this is way worse. I spend most of my free time crying for no reason. 

It actually just dawned on me that this could be PAWS. My question is: can you still experience PAWS 4 months after quitting? Has anyone else experienced something similar? I'd love to hear your stories.",8

We stop half way. I figure I go ahead and take some l tyrosine, vitamin c, agmatine and a five hour energy and prep myself up for the drive by stopping at dq and getting myself a sugary treat to feed the brain. 

We stop at dq. 

While pulling out, I hold a creamsicle in my left hand in a flurry in my right. (Don‚Äôt icecream and drive)

Next thing I know, I feel a curb and see a gust of white air shoot up from the passenger side front tire. 

I have no jack. No spare. 

So what did I do? Handled it like a boss. Called roadside. Their 90 minute response time turned into 5 minutes.

We got picked up and dropped off at a Walmart 2 miles down. 

Just so happens my tires were bought from Walmart and are fully covered.

I was going to make a post that day, but this month has honestly been crazy busy, and I'm at a point now where I don't even think of kratom. It's honestly insane to think how I was letting a stupid green powder dictate so much of my life. I missed out on going to university because of that shit (amongst other things), I was psychologically abusive to my partner at the time because of my constant mood swings and utter state of apathy and by giving that next dose priority above all else. I was broke all the time, because of course kratom wasn't enough and I turned to other drugs on the weekends because those were the only things capable of waking me up inside. I was not me, and at the time, I was in full fledged denial of that statement. 

Now, I am more of myself than I have been since I was a teenager. Quitting that garbage is one of the best things I have ever done and it has provided a newfound appreciation towards life and sobriety. I feel alive again. I'm actively working towards improving other aspects of life, at my own pace of course. I'm saving enough now to where I can go back to school and have zero debt. For anyone wondering if it really is all worth it, it absolutely fucking is. You will come out of it stronger than you ever thought possible. The withdrawal will eventually seem like a tiny little blip of misery you hardly remember that ultimately leads to one of the biggest growth stages of your entire life. And PAWS? Think of it as growing pains that force you back into the ebb and flow of life's natural cycle. Mine lasted close to 6 months, but they did nothing but good for me and I'll never forget the day it came to a close and I woke up feeling so in tune with everything around me again. I'm not kidding, the entire process of it all really is worth it.

I haven't been as active in this community lately as I was during the earlier stages of this process, but I want to let you all know that I'm truly appreciative of everything you all have done for me, and how wholesome you all are. I'm going to try to help out more often now. To you newbies, feel free to message me if you need to talk or need advice or anything really. Much love, peace and respect to all of you!!",38

Starting yesterday, I am now weaning down very little on caffeine (I was doing a drastic reduction in caffeine before yesterday) and have decided today to hold off on trying to wean down on nicotine gum so that I can mostly focus on a bigger kratom taper. Feeling much better today since restarting the nicotine gum. Before today, I was having trouble staying awake past 11 AM.

Anyways, so far I've cut down my kratom consumption from 10 teaspoons to 5 teaspoons. It's still rough but not as bad as trying to wean off multiple substances. I think I'm doing pretty well though because I had been trying to wean down on kratom for over a year and this is the furthest that I've ever gotten with it and I plan on sticking with the taper very strictly. Doesn't help that my new bag of kratom is weaker than my last bag but oh well.

I'm still feeling pretty fatigued once the caffeine wears off at around 11 AM but the nicotine gum seems to help me keep going lol. For now anyways.

Does anyone have a rough idea as to how long I will be fatigued on this lower dose?

I plan on staying at my current dose for awhile before reducing it further. Just want to make sure I'm ready for the next dose reduction before reducing it further.

Also, I've scheduled an appointment with an addiction specialist through my mental health provider. I'm not sure that it was a good idea to let them know I'm dependent on kratom because now they will probably be less likely to prescribe ADHD meds if I ever decide I want to give those a try again. I'll probably be labeled as an addict there. I think I've shot myself in the foot but I guess oh well. Could be worse I suppose.",8

I tried quitting CT on Tuesday and could not make it past 11pm, the misery and restlessness are horrible and unbearable. I took about 4 grams the first night, slept an hour or two. Went all of next daytime without using, then took some (of my old batch) before and during bed, and slept for at least 4 hours. I tried the exact same thing and last night slept none. I have been exercising a ton all day since Tuesday as well, but the night restlessness is impossible to overcome without kratom, and without it I dont sleep. 

I want SO BAD to get off this crap!! I think the difference between last night and the night before is the kratom I took last night was from a different source, so it isn't even helping the WD that much. So vile are the little variations in suppliers/quality that it causes you to go into WD just from getting a new batch! Thats what got me up to 30GPD, taking more of a new batch to stave off WD. That's just one of the many reasons I want to quit!

Please tell me there is hope. I have social anxiety from moving a lot and going to 6 different grade schools, so I have so little friends/support and am so depressed its hellish.

2021-05-22 05:26:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nietod/day_29_life_is_beautiful/,Day 29. Life is beautiful.,"I have made a couple posts since I quit, both to help others out, and keep a record for myself. I feel like the battle is won, I'm so far ahead, I beat the substance. I want to give my full story. I want people to know that kratom may be addictive, it may make you feel good, it may steal your soul, but it is not what it seems.

I was so so so so so dependent on kratom. From the first time I ever tried it, that was immediately the focus of my life. I remember the exact moment it happened. I was 20, playing a video game one night. Earlier that day, a friend of mine gave me some capsules for doing him a huge favor. I knew he liked this stuff, I'd just never tried it, so I was curious, and he gave me some. I took some of them later that night, and I remember the exact moment it hit me. I remember the game I was playing, I remember exactly where I was in the game, and I remember thinking ""wow, I'm having a LOT more fun than normal"", and I knew it was because of the kratom. In that moment, my life's focus was directed towards kratom. I became an all day every day user from my first dose. I have fallen victim to addiction before in my life, so my brain works in the way of ""if something makes me feel good, why would I not wanna feel good 24/7?""

So I immediately fell under the spell. I've done a lot of recreational drugs in my life, but there's truly nothing quite like kratom. Even something as tame as marijuana is on a different level than kratom. For example, when you're stoned, you KNOW you're stoned. You feel that haze. That different level of thought that only comes around when you're stoned. Kratom doesn't appear that way. Kratom takes the exact headspace you're in, and lifts it. Sad? Some kratom will bring you up a bit. Distract you. Angry? Kratom will settle you down real fast, if you're even capable of being angry. Happy? Kratom will make it even better. It gives you energy, motivation, makes you more social, make you warm, make life better. Or so it seems.

I remember the very first time I ever had withdrawals. I'd been taking it for maybe 2 months at that point. All day every day. Not massive doses, but still. I was at work, and I hadn't had my morning dose that day since I was out of K, and I just felt irritable and lethargic all day, all I could think about was getting off work so I could go to the head shop and buy a bag. That eventually happened, and everything was alright from then on out.

Eventually, the friend that had originally given me kratom told me that he found out you can buy kilos online for way cheaper than bags from head shops. This was a complete game changer. We ordered a few, and as soon as I got mine, that's when kratom really took ahold of me. I started taking doses much more frequently, and often times taking high doses (10 gram doses, normally I'd take 5 grams). This continued for a while. I'd wake up, and get junked out of my mind all day on kratom. No matter what was going on that day, i was on kratom the entire time, and most likely had some on me in case I needed some. I eventually quit my job, and, when I eventually ran out of money (I was living at my parents house so I didn't have too many real expenses), I experienced REAL withdrawals for the first time.

I pulled an all nighter one night playing video games. I was out of money, and at the very end of my current kilo. I wasn't all too worried, as I'd never completely ran out of kratom before. I just knew I needed to come up with some money that day and get a new kilo. I took the last dose of the kilo in the middle of the night, and at some point in the late morning, the withdrawals started to show their real power. I was miserable, all i could think about was how the fuck I was going to get another dose. I don't remember exactly what I did, but I ended up getting a kilo, and being fine from there.

For the next several years, I always made sure to have kratom. Always. No matter what it took, I always had my green dust. I did things I regret for kratom. Nothing major, but I did some things that I definitely shouldn't have. And I think about them frequently. But I kept the addiction going at all costs. The primary fear that made me never be without the substance, was fear of withdrawals.

At the end of 2019, I had some personal things go down, and I went on a HORRIBLE drinking binge. I legitimately was hammered 24 hours a day for over 2 months straight. I'd wake up, start drinking, continue to do so until I passed out, wake up, repeat. Eventually, I checked myself in to detox to get off the booze. The only reason I decided to go to a detox facility was because I know that alcohol withdrawals can potentially kill you, and I didn't want to take the chances with that. I was in detox for about 3 days, and it was pure misery. Honestly, the detox facility in my area was pretty shitty all around, so I decided to more or less lie my way out of there. At that point, I knew that the withdrawals weren't going to kill me, and I'd be better off detoxing in my own room and in my own bed than in some shitty facility where I cant even step outside to smoke a cigarette unless someone comes to let us out for a designated smoke time.

When I got home from detox, the first thing I did was take a dose of kratom. I was wanting to quit alcohol, but not kratom. As soon as the kratom kicked in, I felt 75% better. I couldn't believe it. Alcohol withdrawal sucks, but kratom made everything a million times easier. Eventually I felt better, and everything returned to normal, me taking my kratom and all that.

The end of 2020. I'm still dosing up constantly. I'm no longer getting the effect from kratom I desire. Theres no more buzz. There's no fun. I take it so I can sleep, and so I don't withdraw. But I don't realize this. I keep taking more to hopefully eventually get that feeling I'm looking for. And yeah, maybe once in a blue I get that buzz I'm searching for. And it gives me hope that itll happen again. But it doesn't and doesn't and doesn't. And eventually, I got tired of it. I got tired of my life being covered in this stupid green dust. I got tired of worrying if I'd have enough money to get more when I started to get low. I got sick of waking up and depending on a substance to not feel fucking miserable. I got tired of carrying a dose everywhere ""just in case"". I got tired of my stomach being fucked up all the time. I got tired not being able to eat what I want because I'm scared that eating will take my kratom buzz away. I got sick of it all. And I knew there was only one way for it all to end. To get off this shit once and for all. I was just so afraid of the withdrawals. But I quit, and I got through it. And believe me when I say I had HORRIBLE withdrawals. I had pretty much every symptom one could have, and to a bad bad level. And it lasted over 2 weeks. But I fucking got over it. I fucking beat it. I feel like a human being again. I want better for myself now. I look at life differently. I look at people differently. I look at myself differently. Quitting kratom was the hardest thing I've ever done. Truly. But I promise it's so worth it. I know everyone is gonna have a different experience, but I know that anyone who has made it to the end will tell you it's worth it. You will look back and be proud of yourself that you beat this shit. You took your life back. I still can't believe I can truly say I'm 29 days clean. I never in a million years would've dreamed I could say that. But I can, and I know that anyone who is in a tough spot right now is 100% capable of being able to say that statement too one day.

This sub has helped me so much. I love all of you and hope your journey goes smooth, no matter the difficulty. If I can do it, you can too. It's hard, it hurts, but it will bring you back to life, it will bring you to places you forgot you had in your mind. Believe in yourself.

Edit: I've never ever received any sort of reddit award before, so I send my sincerest thanks for such. I truly hope my words were able to give even just one person hope who is in the worst of it. You will get through it. Time will feel like an eternity. You will be miserable. You will not sleep. You will think you're dying. But you're healing. You're making the right choice for yourself, and you're putting yourself through that agony for a reason. You will succeed if you try. It will get easier. I promise. I cannot express enough about how horrible my withdrawals were. I've never been more miserable in my life for that long. But I made it out, and you will too.",72

Hi friends - I won't get into my whole story but I've been a part of this great community for a while now, currently on approx 50-60 gpd (sometimes more), built up to that over about the past 4 years. I've tried to quit numerous times CT (tapering does not work for me), never made it past Day 16. I can easily get through the physical acutes, especially with some helper meds from my doctor, but it's always the anhedonia and empty feeling from PAWS that does me in. I've also tried Naltrexone, that helped with cravings but I still couldn't handle the anhedonia that came along with it, especially since I am in a very demanding, creative field where I have to be on my A-game all the time.

Anywho - I have been discussing with my Dr. trying to use suboxone to help quit this time. I understand how it works, that it is also an opioid that binds to the Mu receptors but she claims it cannot make me high, and will help me feel normal. When I ask her how long I will have to stay on subs, she never really gives a straight answer. My understanding is it's a very long term thing. BC of all this, I am a bit hesitant and afraid of trading one thing for another....it may be the lesser of two evils but it sounds like it will be just one more thing I have to quit in the future, and will not be allowing my brain to heal itself fully. I've also seen many on this sub say to stay away from it. What are your experiences with it? Does it help? How long were you on it, and what did you have to go through to quit suboxone? Do you get withdrawal from that? I'd love to hear your stories. My Dr. is pushing it pretty hard and saying it's harmless but anecdotal stories I've seen about it seem to suggest otherwise. Much love fellow quitters!",2

However recently, and im almost ashamed to admit this, ive thought about throwing it all away. About 2 weeks ago I took phenibut for 3 days and two weeks before that I did the same. I believe this little stint with another dumb mind altering drug has negatively effected me and made me crave what my real drug of choice is - Kratom. I don think all was lost with that little slip but I can definitely see how it tainted my mood and thought making process. Recently I keep think about how one shot of K would take the edge off, take the stress off and make me feel good albeit for a for an extremely short amount of time. What has prevented me from doing this gratefully is my built in system of friends that I can tell and that hold me accountable. Thank god so much for this. I keep playing the tape of what would happen and its quite ugly. I'm prepping for a move to Los Angeles and it would be  a complete disaster to not be on solid footing during this transition. One moment at a time and one day at a time. I dont have to USE today! Just for today. Everyday I stay on this path, even if it doesnt feel like it in the moment I am that much closer to happiness, freedom, confidence, success and stability long term. The trade off for some temporary fake relief is simply NOT WORTH IT! If anyone reads this and wants some advice on how to stay on the path please reach out to me. I go to an amazing Kratom Support group that has really helped in addition to some other stuff I do. Please reach out, don't relapse without telling anyone.

It doesn't even help depression or motivation anymore, it was great at first.

Now I'm just depressed and with low motivation even if I do take it.

I overused mdma and other stimulants when I was younger, I'm hoping I still have the ability to feel naturally happy.

I will try my best to go through the depression but I've not had a good past record when trying to stay sober, eventually I usually cave in and need something to escape.

The acute symptoms are basically gone, but wow are my emotions still all screwed up and flat. Finally after 3 weeks, I can start to feel the tiniest bit of genuine feelings creeping back in. I am starting to remember how I used to feel before taking Kratom and its amazing how much of an emotion killer it was for me. Dont get me wrong, when I was in terrible chronic pain/fatigue from the cancer it was more helpful than not that it blunted everything. But now that is past, I am optimistic about the future for the first time in many years. For me I may have relapsed several times if I had any in the house.

I quit those and found Kratom which took away my cravings.  I would take 5-10  grams per day which eventually turned into 20-30 gpd for the last 4-5 years.  I don't even remember.  A month ago I quit nicotine and thought that I'd try to quit Kratom too.. i thought I'd use the momentum towards quitting Kratom  so over the last few weeks I've tapered down the 12 gpd. This eventually started creeping up towards 15-20 and so I redoubled my efforts.  This last week I've been more accountable and managed to stay around 4-6gpd. I was planning on taking zero today but I ended up taking 1 gram in the morning.  Over this last week I've been having sneezing fits. I need to get some vitamin C and other supplements too. I just try to keep telling myself life itself is loaded and high already and I was born into this world without smoking or eating Kratom so I should be able to return to that innocence.

1. Sleep is still a battle. Irritableness and insomnia are very much still a part of my nightly game. I think I got a couple hours of sleep somewhere in there, not sure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Despite that, woke up feeling pretty good.

2. 7am workout complete so energy is definitly coming take. Takes a few min to get the engine started in the morning but I'm making new habits so things are slowly becoming automatic. Wake up, brush teeth, start coffee, make a smoothie, shower, start my day. My mornings are starting to be on auto pilot.

3. Lathargy throughout the day has gotten a ton better. Still comes in slight waves, yesterday was bad for a couple hours but I pushed through. Today has started off better.

4. That depressive black cloud and feeling of being out of sync with reality and my surroundings, that hazey feeling or bubble I felt like I was in has almost evaporated. Days are looking brighter and things don't seem so foreign anymore. 

5. Things are not 100% back to normal, I know I still have a long journey ahead of me to repair a lot of the damage I have done but I'm fully prepared to embark on this journey cause every day on this side is 100x better then and fully dosed day on that side. True Story!

Thank you all for being here and sharing your suggestions, experience, strength, and hope. This group has honestly played a vital role in my process.

Now this info i have read many times on reddit and i was sceptical but i finally got to try it (30gpd now), i still think Kratom has its place along with weed and shrooms but if you want to come off it you have to do these things

First thing is TAPER TAPER TAPER just stick with it, once you hit a low that you start to feel your anxiety stay on that dose for as long as it take for you body to adjust once it goes away and it will (lower doses maybe a week ) when you finall get down to around 5-7 gpd start mega dosing of VITAMIN C  ( you get 1000mg tabs on amazon make sure its ascorbic!)  take 3 of these every 3-4 hours, while continuing to taper down to about 3-5 gpd 

and lastly same with MAGNESIUM take morning and night to help with the old RLS and what ever other method is in your routine hot bath again bit of yoga or meditation.

But yes 3 main things is TAPER,MEGADOSE VIT C AND Magnesium

My doctor wants to put me on citalopram and gave me some klonopin to catch up on a few nights( she only gave me a few, definitely don't want to take it unless I'm absolutely desperate) I'm a little weary about starting an ssri though because I've never really dealt with depression or anxiety before all this.

However, I remembered some crushed leaf I had gotten for free with my last bulk order of powder that is brewed to make a tea. From previous experience, I believed it to be far less potent and thought it might take the edge off and allow me to sleep without setting back my progress too much. I took it once Saturday night, and twice Sunday before I realized that it was in fact having quite a potent effect on me. Upon realizing this, I had my parents lock it up where I could  no longer access it. My last dose of the crushed leaf tea was 6:57 PM on Sunday. That puts me at nearly 100 hours CT. I have to say that I'm honestly amazed at how painless this has been. I had at times wished that I had quit back in February when my kratom shipment was late due to the winter storms at that time. However, it did give me 3 months to plan this out very well and purchase numerous substances to aid in quitting. This included mega dosing Vitamin C, agamtine, memantine, several herbal supplements, NSI-189, 9-me-bc, Semax, l-citrulline, NAC, androstenetriol, 7-keto DHEA, and naltrexone. The naltrexone only arrived yesterday and I have done a couple of tests with ULDN at 20 micrograms to speed up the process of receptor resensitization. I have been eating healthy, exercising daily, and binge watching Game of Thrones. I have also been using valerian root and magnesium. Since Friday, the least sleep I have gotten was 5 hours, though I usually sleep around 6.5 hours. The coldness and chills that tortured me during tianeptine WDs have been nearly nonexistent. My anxiety has been less than it was while taking kratom, I've only had a few brief glimpses of the depression that was nearly constant before quitting, cravings seem to come and go rather quickly, and I have  only experienced very mild anhedonia at times. I will say that I've had unbelievably sore muscles after exercising but that's likely the result of me doing exercises that I'd not done in years, along with no longer experiencing hyperanalgesia from kratom. I honestly do not know how it was possible for me to quit after using for 3.5 years at well over 20gpd and have virtually nonexistent WD symptoms.  I assume it was the wide array of compounds I decided to use that made this so much easier than I thought it would be. Also, I'm well aware of the risks of taking as many different things as I am but I was extremely desperate to quit kratom while treating the damage it may have done and the underlying issues that led me to abusing it in the way that I did. I'm going to attempt LDN tonight before I go to bed. My parents have planned to go to a steakhouse tomorrow so I will attempt to post an update on my experience with the LDN.",7

So I ordered some, and began taking it.  Took for a week or so before I got the courage to go cold turkey on the Kratom and wow!!!  Day 4 and I can't believe how much easier this has been.  I was still tired day 1 and 2 but not the all day bone sucking exhaustion i was expecting.  I was able to go to my scheduled exercise classes, and be productive for a little bit each day.

I typically drunk clean on the weekends and was convinced I lacked the motivation to do anything different.

I decided on a whim one day that I was tired of spending so much money and truthfully I wasn't getting the same effect from it. Initially I was just going to take a break so I could go back to it, but I decided to see how long I could go, and eventually decided it wasn't worth going back. 

I came to that conclusion after a week of withdrawals. I felt absolutely horrible and was acting out like crazy. After that. I decided I was done for good. Since the first two weeks passed I haven't had many cravings at all. Mornings are the worst because I used to take it to get a boost to my morning.

2021-05-20 11:17:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nh2x4w/day_2_ct/,Day 2 CT,"Hi, everyone. 

This forum has been a source of support for me. Here's hoping my experience can help someone else. I haven't been on K very long. Started late last year. Quit after a month without any withdrawal symptoms. Started again in January and have been taking it since. I was taking two to three heaping tablespoons a day before I jumped on Tuesday evening. Not sure what it amounted to in GPD. Also sometimes got shots and extract pills. Last dose was Tuesday at 6 p.m.(ish). 

A little about my history: I was an opioid addict who became a heroin addict who got clean with the help of subs, which I was prescribed for about four years before successfully tapering in 2019. 

No excuses here: I relapsed with pills in 2020. 

I came clean to my wife, who knows my history, and stopped before I got in too deep. I was chipping. A few oxys one day. Several days off. Another few pills. I'd have minor withdrawal symptoms during each pause. My body is such that even after more than a year of clean time, a single pill will lead to withdrawal when it leaves my system. Telling my wife is what broke the cycle. 

As I was getting back on the wagon, I found kratom, and the rest is history. I thought it was a miracle. It kept my opioid cravings at bay but allowed me to function at a high level at work. 

But I soon saw the downsides. While high, I was impatient with the people I loved. My sex drive, never roaring to begin with, evaporated. Often, I'd take too much and have bouncy vision that lasted for hours. And the addict anxiety kicked in: Did I have enough to get through the day? Where could I get more? What happened if I had to get on a plane? It was exactly the same mindset I had when I was on opiates. 

I woke up on Wednesday and, having skipped my night dose, was already feeling the telltale withdrawal symptoms. Rheumy eyes and drippy nose. I walked to my local smoke shop, about a mile away, to buy more K. But it was closed. 

I live in a very big city. There are many smoke shops around. But I decided then and there that I would walk home and lean into the suck. I'm moving soon to another state, and I want a fresh start. So here I am. 

Withdrawal is different for everyone, as you've all read here. I don't want to minimize what anyone is going through or will go through. My experience so far is that the physical symptoms are a bee sting compared to the body-quaking hell of heroin withdrawal and the endless fatigue of sub withdrawal. It took me months, even after a very disciplined taper, to feel better after jumping from subs.

Kratom isn't that for me. At all. I have enough energy to work. Minor aches and pains are responding pretty well to Tylenol. The itchy burn in my limbs had me tossing and turning last night, but I did get some sleep intermittently. 

The mental strain is harder. I don't have cravings. But I am crying about everything. A sweet cuddle from my dogs. My wife saying she's proud of me. My brain is trying to trick me into believing that this state is permanent -- that I'll always feel this empty, worthless and hopeless. But I've been through this stuff before, and let me tell you: It gets better, day by day, hour by hour. The despair you feel is temporary. Please, please believe me. 

I'm a runner. About 25-30 miles a week. I ran yesterday. I'm going to run today, hell or high water. And tomorrow. And the next day. And I'm going to savor every minute of this experience, the feeling of my brain and body returning to baseline. I can already feel it 40 hours in.

I'm so fucking thankful that smoke shop was closed. Good luck to all.",17

Has anyone has experience with that? Did your testosterone go back to normal after a while? If so, how long?

I'm going to be taking my doctor it was because of the k. Are they going to avoid giving me Testosterone treatment to see if it goes back up? Or can they treat it for a month or 2 and then stop of that fixed it? (I only ask that because I've seen some people say once you go on t treatment, you aren't allowed to stop?)

Are there any OTC test boosters that you have tried that worked and aren't just snake oil?

Yesterday was my first day that I could honestly say I felt like I hit that ""Teenager"" stage. So not quite 100% adult but was able to do any and all things and it felt like an overall OK day. Some parts of the day actually felt exciting and good to be doing.

‚Ä¢ I got in my morning workout (PS. I noticed a little hyper sensitivity to my pre-workout powder I took for the first time since quitting) so I'm gonna back off that.
‚Ä¢ I went shopping at my vendor for the business and was genuinely excited to see the others and conversation wasn't so hard. I noticed my socialness slightly coming back more.
‚Ä¢ I picked up the kiddos from school and took them to their modeling coaching classes they got to bi-weekly, which is like an hour away. I mention this because I noticed I got a little irritable both on the drove there and way home about 1/2-3/4 of the way. So long car drives for me are not a strong suit lol.  Anyone else notice this about long car drives during this stage?
‚Ä¢ prior to modeling we walked the downtown area and I got the girls some dinner and ice cream, we took some pictures around the area and did some store hopping. Day was nice.
‚Ä¢ I dropped off the one to her classes and then had to kill 2 hours until she was done, I was a little cautious in advance about this because of so much downtime so the baby and I walked a near by mall that we always do and for the first time I did it K-free. It felt good not having to dose before the car ride and then before going into the mall and then again before going home. In the past during this 4 hour time frame I would normally dose upwards of 24-30g just to get through it all. God, what a terrible habit to do routinely just to spend time with your kids during this day. But not yesterday, nope!
‚Ä¢ Came home to the wife who had been a little out of it so she was sleeping. She woke shortly after I arrived and we finished watching this Netflix show we had been into. I enjoyed it. Up until 12:30am binging it to finish lol.
‚Ä¢ sleep is still a battle. I tried to lay down on my own but couldn't fall asleep for an hour. This night was mostly an insomnia type feeling, minor RLS but not unbearable, but the combo was enough to keep me from falling. I took a couple hits of delta-8 and it ultimately helped me relax my mind and body and helped me get 4 hours. Not the most but hopefully enough gas was put in the tank to get through today.

Sorry for the long detailed post but I treat this thread like a journal, tracking my progress for both myself and those who read. I know everyones journey is different but maybe my story may be similar to someone else's and can bring hope in days of despair. It's getting better folks, not perfect but better and it will for you too. Im still early in this fight but I'm becoming stronger as the battle goes on. Here's to a life after K!",4

The past couple days I tried a new supplement to help with my depressed mood, it contained rhodiola rosea and l-theanine. I feel comfortable during the day albeit bored. Music helps. Work is a struggle, mostly because time goes by so slowly. Bored is ok though, better than feeling awful. Working out is a chore but I‚Äôm doing it lightly every other day. 

Sleep has been very off the past two nights. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if the rhodiola is playing a role there because it was a bit better before I started taking it. I just feel uncomfortable in bed, sometimes temperature-wise, sometimes positionally. 

Chills/sweats are still present although much better than week 1. I have trouble finding the perfect place between hot and cold where I‚Äôm not sweating. 

My wife‚Äôs anger with me appears to be starting to abate. She is so used to this routine of catching me lying about addiction, me cleaning up, and then things normalizing. I feel so awful for what I‚Äôve done to her but it does me no good to focus on that. I just have to keep telling myself to stay clean and the pain will go away forever. 

Overall, I thought I would feel better by now given my many experiences with relapse and getting clean before. It‚Äôs ok though. I‚Äôll be patient.

Days 1-7/8:

Every time I smoked it would relieve something, no clue what, I guess my mental addiction to smoking, but would also exacerbate the out of touch with reality feeling, and would fall into all of my negative emotions pretty quickly.

Which didn‚Äôt necessarily happen beforehand while just smoking normally.

Back when I was drinking daily smoking would fuck me up to the point offff just being spun/twisted/fucked up whatever you wanna call it.

I enjoy the sleep benefits of weed, or cbd/cbn, and I throughly enjoy thc when I‚Äôm mentally stable lmao.

So I just want to hear all of your stories of use while using, use while detoxing and paws, and use afterwards!

My daily doses were every 3 to 4 hours 1.5Tsp. Over the past 48 hours I have cut down to 1Tsp every 3 to 4 hours(5 times a day) a 33% reduction in each dose. The day before I started i woke up with a sore throat and today woke up with another sore throat so I'm think that's not related. What I have noticed is today at work ( day 2) I have noticed some mild to medium cold/hot flashes. My plan is to stay on the 1Tsp every 3 to 4 hours ( 5times a day) for the next 9 to 10 day until my body adjusts and the expanding the time between doses to every 5 to 6 hours (3 to 4 times per day). My plan Is to try to get off or almost off my the first week of july for my birthday and for vacation (even though I probably wont go anywhere). I have been working out 3 to 4 times per week for the last 5 months and will try to increase my workout durations to make my body worn out so hopefully I wont notice withdrawls as much while tapering down. Worsr case scenario is the first week of july I have off work so I can have bad withdrawls and not affect work but I'm hoping that tapering down for the next 5 weeks or so that the withdrawls will be more mild.,2

(I used it for 2.5 years, gradually increasing and capped at 30 for the past year plus because that‚Äôs all my body could handle). Now for some reflections.

Before my quit, for MONTHS I pummeled my body with kratom as soon as I woke up and by the time I went to sleep, I‚Äôd be nodding out and even face planted into my food I was eating at one time. My personality was gone, I felt nothing and was touched by nothing, including music and thought provoking things I once loved (I am a sensitive soul by nature). My eating habits were essentially don‚Äôt eat until the nighttime so I could get as high as possible, and then binge right before bed. I gained weight, I lost my fitness. I was suffering the second I woke up and all throughout the day, my mind would nag me about what I became. Once I got to that point, a thought popped into my head. I was living in absolute addiction misery. NOTHING, including withdrawal and rebuilding all of my habits and daily life, could amount to this suffering, knowing how pathetic I had become. 

So I said fuck this and quit. I was tired of being in limbo between dead and alive, day in and day out. And I‚Äôve felt shitty and restless and uncomfortable, but I‚Äôm feeling human and more alive than I‚Äôve been in years. I haven‚Äôt really had any cravings and I know I‚Äôm just done. I was so bad off that I‚Äôd throw my k in the trash and swear it off, just to dog through the garbage in the morning, repeat. I will never go back to the weak person I was. Trust me if I can do this, so can you.

Stayed on it for a month, about 20-30gpd. And went C/T. The sexual side effects and exhaustion were too much. Withdrawal was shitty for about 5 days then it was business as usual. Stayed off for a couple weeks, picked up some more. I try to tell myself I‚Äôll just use it occasionally but the euphoria, motivation, and sense of peace are too irresistible for me to maintain casual use.

The hardest part of not using drugs of any kind is the emptiness and despair that comes with abstinence. I‚Äôve been through it enough times with enough substances to know how much better life is on the other side, but that knowledge doesn‚Äôt mitigate the suffering of a chemically unbalanced brain. My body aches, my depression and fear is RAGING. I can‚Äôt think about the past, good or bad, it makes me inconsolably sad. I can‚Äôt think about the future because I have no wants, hopes, dreams, and no drive to accomplish anything. I am an aching husk, a pathetic worthless sack of meat and bones.

I will prevail, however. In about a week I will be a machine again. Color will come back to the world and my life. And the only struggle will be fighting back the longing for intense euphoria or sedation. Not to take for granted static happiness, and trading it to alleviate boredom. Good luck friends.",10

So to combat the fatigue, I have been consuming a lot of caffeine, usually a 300mg energy drink or comparable cup of coffee. For most of my time using caffeine I've had an extreme sensitivity to it and consuming around 100mg would give me bad anxiety. However, I can down a bang energy drink like it's nothing and just barely feel awake enough to get out of bed. No anxiety, slight increase in energy but definitely not stimulated or anything. I've had no heart related withdrawal symptoms and no heart related anxieties from the caffeine.

2021-05-19 17:51:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ngi9li/want_to_quit_but_need_pain_management/,"Want to quit, but need pain management","Looking for some insight. I've been on Kratom for pain management for years. Before that, I was on methadone. At this point, my kratom use has become so inconvenient and stressful that I'm tempted to go back to methadone. I know that's a huge no-no in this community but allow me to provide my reasons for doing so and hopefully I can find someone who has been in a similar position that can offer some insight.

I take about 7-8 (00 sized) capsules roughly every 3-4 hours. I hate that I wake up in WD and have to take more to sleep. I rarely get more than 6 hours of uninterrupted sleep. 

This is a minor complaint, but making the capsules every day is such an inconvenience and because I work so much, feels like time I can spend doing other things. (cheaper to buy powder in bulk and just make the capsules myself. I absolutely refuse to take it in any other form. It's less conspicuous when out in public and at work as well.)

Travel concerns. It hasn't happened but what if I need to go somewhere that Kratom is illegal in? Making sure I have enough to take with me on overnight/multiple day stays or having to bring my equipment with me to make capsules is frustrating and kind of embarrassing. 

I work a lot and have recently taken on new financial responsibilities. Kratom is a bit costly and when I was on methadone, the script was fairly cheap.

It's not as effective at pain management and I'm currently dealing with a back problem that is just getting worse. 

6-12 months ago, I was ready to taper because I was solely taking Kratom to stave off wd's. I don't take it for pleasure or anything, I'm just physically dependent on it. The pain relief was secondary and was something I could manage without K. Then my back problems got worse and it's gotten to the point where I need something because it's greatly affecting my quality of life. 

I recently took some methadone I got from someone and it was such a great difference. My pain level was at a point to where I could do my physical therapy without having to quit because of the pain. I was able to actually sleep through the night and my work day was more productive because I wasn't in so much pain. I just had to take 5mg in the morning and then another 5 at night, no having to take a handful of capsules multiple times a day to stave off the WDs

I'm thinking about trying to get on methadone again. I've thought about subs but I hear they're not as good for pain.

Anyway, I can feel the judgment coming, as I know these probably aren't good reasons to turn to such an addicting drug but at this point, I'm not worried about being on something for the long haul if it will help. But I welcome any and all advice, thank you!",1
2021-05-19 17:34:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nghvg2/day_4_again_we_are_all_fallible/,Day 4 (Again). We are all Fallible.,"Hey everyone, 

I used to post here quite a bit during my last stint with Kratom almost a year ago at this point. It was an amazing journey (read my past posts to see where I was at if you choose). Getting off Kratom was almost fun back then because I truly thought I‚Äôd never touch it after 5 years on 30-40gpd. I was able to stay off of it for 4-5 months and was really happy for the most part. My life got so much better because of that. But, when hard times came, the voice came back too.

I had a few relapses here and there and stopped again in late 2020. Then I had the brilliant idea to start again this February. Of course I had my reasons (excuses) and they are easy to find if you look for them. I didn‚Äôt want to, it was almost like a devil inside me that willed me to it. That may sound dramatic, but i have no other explanation for why I did it again.

This time it‚Äôs just embarrassing and I‚Äôm choosing to suffer in silence with the exception of this group and my mother. 

Luckily I really didn‚Äôt push it too far this time and was taking .5-1gram a day, but I guess because of rekindling and taking it for 2 months, the withdrawals are still very very annoying. I find myself very emotional since I suppressed my feelings again. I feel like I have the flu (granted not like the first WD experience). I can‚Äôt think at 100%, anxiety, depression, and all the other fun you get from using Kratom. 

I think it‚Äôs important to mention that the reason I kept taking it was because the withdrawals started immediately. I took it one night and woke up with withdrawals. Rekindling is real and it‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so easy to fall back into the habit. It‚Äôs either:

a.) Stop taking it and feel like shit for a few days/week 
b.) Get immediate satisfaction and put it off with the knowledge that you are directly going to make your withdrawals worse in the future

I learned this time that not only can I not take it, but that I‚Äôm fallible and susceptible to those thoughts a lot more than I wanted to believe. I had a mentality that I‚Äôd never touch it again and really believed that. But I took it on an impulse. And anyone can. It‚Äôs honestly amazing how easy it is to fall right back into it. 

It‚Äôs easier this time because of the amount, but also because I know how amazing it is on the other side. You may laugh at the amount I‚Äôm complaining about, but if I hadn‚Äôt stopped now, that amount would have spiraled to where I was at last year. 

I also felt the shame, guilt, and loss of confidence all over again. The same fears of what I would do if I didn‚Äôt have it on me, if I had to travel, etc... 

Kratom strips you of self-respect by its nature, especially once you realize your addicted and don‚Äôt know how to stop. 

But Im fixing it again. And if you need the motivation, just know it‚Äôs not only doable, but the other side is magnitudes better than being a slave to any substance that makes you feel like this. If anyone is feeling like they will relapse, please don‚Äôt. You have no idea how much better you‚Äôll feel the next day if you ignore that voice. 

Good luck everyone üëçüëç",11

I used for a relatively short time to some people I have read about on here (7 months). I took the extract shots about 3-4 a day and near the end it made me extremely sick. I didn't think it was the kratom so I took more the next day. That night at work I had a huge anxiety attack I had to leave work and literally felt like I was going crazy. I've never had issues with anxiety or anything so this was a first time for me. The next morning I woke up and found this page and threw away all my stash. The first 3 days were absolutely hell for me. Anxiety through the roof which was the thing that almost broke me. RLS but all my body. Not getting any sleep at all. Couldn't really eat anything.

I had no idea the hell this plant could bring. But I'm here and getting better every single day. The worst part is I look back at all the money I've spent these months and I have a wife and 3 kids. That was my biggest motivation for getting through this.

Because it doesn‚Äôt really ‚Äúwork‚Äù I just keep dosing and dosing thinking eventually I‚Äôll break through my tolerance. 

 Nope. 40g of powder in my system for no reason for what so ever. I‚Äôm constantly exhausted, my sleep is terrible, and I struggle to walk from point a to point b. It‚Äôs pathetic.

I want to be done for good. I objectively know that when I stop, things clear up fast. I know I am a better person without it. Why do I keep going back to something that doesn‚Äôt work?",7

Just recently found this sub.  Was hoping for some advice or any words of encouragement.  I really want to quit this stuff but I have not been able to muster up the courage yet.  My kratom use and addiction is making me hate myself and is slowly but surely ruining my life.  I have a mild history of opiate abuse but never went for treatment.  I have been a heavy every day user for a little over a year now.  Started with extracts, was able to slowly transition to only leaf twice a day around 8 months ago, and now I‚Äôm back to both extracts and leaf all day every day.  I tried to switch back to just leaf a few days ago but my first day without the extract was full of so many panic attacks, vomiting, insomnia, and other symptoms that I then upped my extract use even further.  I was drinking 2 double dose extract shots and around 40g of leaf every day.  Over the past few days I have been trying to taper down on the extract (down to just one shot a day split into 2 doses) but my leaf intake has uncontrollably increased as a result.  I am wondering now if a taper is actually my best bet or if going ice cold turkey would be better.  I want to rid myself of this ongoing turmoil but I‚Äôm just terrified of how bad the withdrawals will get.  How did you guys find the courage to do it?",1

I started using kratom daily back in September. I hated my job but kratom made it bearable. At my worst point in March I have no way of knowing for sure, but I estimate I was taking about 20-25 gpd.

I'm a rock climber, and the first week in April I went on a week long trip to the red river gorge. I knew that week was going to be good for me mentally so I chose it to try and get the worst of the withdrawal out of the way.

One of the friends on the trip was G. We'd only climbed with each other 3 or 4 times but we always click super well. The first night I the trip we were having a heart to heart because both of us had really been going through it and I told her about my addiction and how I was planning to use the trip to quit. She ended up helping me stay off kratom that week, and we got quite a bit closer.

The week after the trip, I failed at staying off. A bit later G and I started a romantic relationship but I've still been struggling to stay off kratom. She encouraged me to go to therapy, and I've just started. I'm really trying to be proactive about solving the problems that led to my addiction in the first place.

I told G that because we're dating, she can't be the person that holds me accountable for staying clean. To me that felt like how a codependent relationship forms. And she set a boundary that I can't be on kratom while belaying her when we're on climbing trips. Fair enough.

Last weekend, G and I took a trip to the new river gorge. I took a couple grams of kratom with me planning to take it only in the evenings after we were done climbing. I'm down to something like 8 gpd but I still haven't kicked the habit.

Saturday morning before we left for the crag, I took a dose. We got to the crag and I started climbing but got freaked out leading the first route because climbing is mostly mental for me, and I was feeling so guilty. I came down and we started getting ready for her to climb. But before she started climbing, I told her that I had taken a dose that morning and I couldn't belay her.

For a bit she said she wasn't mad because I was honest with her and I hadn't crossed her boundary. But about a minute later she started crying. There's nothing more important to G than climbing and I had taken that away from her. She had a bad week and was looking forward to the mental break that climbing gives her and I just stole it. 

Watching her cry is one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I couldn't control myself for a single morning.

That day I promised her that I'll never take kratom again the morning before we climb and it's a promise I'm going to keep. I would take a month straight of the worst withdrawal I've ever felt over watching her cry like that again.

I'm trying to taper rather than go cold turkey but I'm trying to take concrete steps towards quitting. I just feel so scared that this addiction will always define me. I'm so scared that I'll never be able to quit. Being completely sober is not a mental state that I enjoy right now and I'm scared that it never will be. I want to be a positive influence in people's lives and I can't with this addiction. I feel so alone.",6

About a year and a half ago I was told to quit by someone I love and I didn‚Äôt have the heart to tell them I was hopelessly addicted. I tried to quit that day and the first night I was shaking, sweating, all the shitty symptoms. Ever since then I‚Äôve been terrified of the symptoms. Over the first year I tapered down to about 20-25g a day and got stuck. We planned a trip where we would have to get on a plane and that was basically my deadline where I HAD TO quit. I was afraid to bring any on the plane in fear of getting found out, and I had googled shops at our destination and there would be no way I could make it to them. Over the 6 months leading up to the trip I tapered down to about 8g per day which I was super proud of but goin any lower seemed impossible. 

Time kept flying and I wasn‚Äôt able to go any lower. We had 1.5 weeks until the trip and I forced myself to drop to 2g in the morning and 2g at night. We then came up to 2 days before the trip and I tried to go the full day with none at all but I felt miserable so I caved in and took 4gthat night. The day before the trip I did the same thing, powered through it. I tried tosleep the night before our flight, barely got any shut eye. Right before we left for our flight I took a last Hail Mary dose of 5G. I had so much anxiety about not having a dose for the first day but we got to o our destination and I told myself to put it in the past there‚Äôs nothing I could do. We went and had tons of drinks and stayed up late. Luckily I think the withdrawal symptoms blended in with my hangover and lack of sleep each day of that trip. When we got back home and I finally got a good night of sleep I woke up and felt normal again for the first time in a long time. I think I got lucky with the timing but I have no desire to pick it up again. I‚Äôm finally free!

I just had to share this with somebody since I can‚Äôt share it with anyone close to me. Thanks for reading, you guys can do this.",65

Cleaning the area where I used to dose and reorganizing it sort of... broke up the ritual of it a bit in my mind... if that makes sense. 

My worst days were actually during my taper when I dropped from 8-10ish down to 4. I think I‚Äôve gotten really lucky because I wasn‚Äôt on very much for very long - and I have all of you to thank for that. The dangers of this substance are not widely known - and I learned about them here - which gave me the push I needed to quit. And especially to not convince myself it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and take more the last couple days. So thank you thank you thank you to everyone here sharing their experience. 

I‚Äôm still a bit brain foggy, but I‚Äôve been taking Vitamin C, multivitamins, ashwaghandha some evenings, and have made myself exercise everyday which seems to make such a huge difference in my mental state. This may not be for everyone, but I‚Äôve also quit drinking and become pretty active in SMART recovery. The workbook has given me a lot of perspective on my use of substances.

My husband and I are elated, but this was pretty unexpected for a variety of different reasons. I've done a lot of digging in regards to taking kratom during pregnancy, and because there's so little that folks know out there, I'm deciding to stop using it. 

The problem is that I'm unsure of the withdraw I would experience if just quit CT.

I currently use about 6 grams with lemon and boiling water to make a tea extract in the mornings. I think this would be considered 6g/day. I've been using for only about 2 months, and I don't feel any withdraw effects in the morning before I drink the tea again (mainly take it for energy effects). Would I be good to go CT?",3

So I was on kratom for a good two months or so. I started back in late February, mainly as just a weekend kind of vice. Then late March I started using every day.. about 7g, twice per day. Eventually I started to feel rough while on it and was beginning to feel that urge to wanting to take more to help alleviate any of the discomforting side effect, so I decided to make the plunge and quite before it was too late. This past Sunday was my last dose and haven‚Äôt touched it since.

I am feeling some kind of withdrawals, definitely not as bad as others for sure, grant it I only used for 2 months, but I have the RLS and the anxiety.. nausea and diarrhea.. you name it. Hoping that these go away soon and that PAWS isn‚Äôt problem. I know everyone is different but can withdrawals really manifest even though I‚Äôve only used every day for 2 months?

This shit is just not good. I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm quitting and I‚Äôm so glad I found this wonderful and supportive community. Thank you all so much in advance!",3

I felt 90% by day 7. Today I had to pull up a calendar to figure out exactly how many days it had been; I feel 99% today. This quit has been much easier than the last with only mild anxiety for the first 5 days or so. Worst has been rls and general insomnia. I am on day 3 of full 8 hour nights.

STOP NOW! You will make it through and remember how good it feels to be a normal person again. 

I pushed through while working normally and maintaining relationship with my wife and 2 year old. I found it is almost easier when you are busy; it keeps your mind off the various pain.

Eat well, drink tons of water especially when you aren't thirsty, excersise as much as you can stand it and look into supplementation. Practice breathing; see Wim Hof.

Don't take benadryl sleep aids, don't use alcohol as a sleep aid. They will interrupt your sleep and worsen your rls dramatically.

We started watching it and all of a sudden I had an enjoyment for the show (I haven't enjoyed much of anything up until that point). I was into it, I wasn't thinking about sleep anymore, we were laughing. For just them 2 hours I felt free and myself again (to a certain extent). It was a great ending to the day! 

Then the time to lay down came and it all changed, lol. Maybe it was the Benadryl + Melatonin combo I took but getting to sleep was difficult. Irratible and couldn't get comfortable. Tossing and turning to find the right position. Went to the couch, nothing. Back to bed, nothing. Insomnia set in. I took a few hits of some Delta 8 and I think that helped tremendously. Shortly after I must have finally fell asleep. It wasn't long cause I was up again at 430am and then 530 and then 630 but I don't feel completely drained or exhausted just frustrated that last night was difficult.

I overworked my body during recovery with weights and sprinting and now can only do yoga.  This reduced capacity for distraction and lack of mind-altering substance has brought me face to face (or at least faced-toward) with my trauma.  I decided to stop running from problems literally and figuratively (for decades) and get psychotherapy.  I write all this to share the joy (at least conceptually) of what can be done when sober (at least for me).  Sobriety has lightened my vision and given me the confidence to admit my weaknesses.

I said maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?
Maybe I will never be
All the things that I wanna be
Now is not the time to cry
Now's the time to find out why
I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
Maybe I don't really wanna know
How your garden grows
'Cause I just wanna fly
Lately, did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain
As it soaks you to the bone?
Maybe I just wanna fly
Wanna live, I don't wanna die
Maybe I just wanna breathe
Maybe I just don't believe
Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
Gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever",5

2. Things that will make your RLS much worse: Alcohol, Benadryl, and for some people Melatonin, and caffiene, and nicotine.
3. Candy! It always helps me get a short rush of dopamine
4. Go for a long long walk or exercise until you are exhausted
5. Baths and regular use of magnesium of whatever intake
6. Ibuprofen or Advil can help ease the achiness
7. Cold and flu medicine with DXM 25-50mg will help alleviate the side effects. (I personally cant because i get a weird reaction from DXM abuse but it did work for me)
8. Eat a meal when cravings get rough
9. Dont freak out if you cant sleep, just keep yourself busy. Dont just lay there in agony, youll sleep soon enough
10. This is kind of complex but it works for me, remove all ways of getting kratom whether its giving your car keys to someone or giving someone you trust your wallet. I will sometimes pretend that im going to use and psych myself up just keep saying ‚Äúok just 2 more hours and ill use‚Äù but you just gotta keep extending that time. It pulls a weird trick on my brain that gets my blood rushing and dopamine flowing without actually using.

I used to be articulate with a vast vocabulary, and could spell literally any word, now I just feel dumb. The brain fog/anxiety/or any mental issue this plant is giving me has scared me into believing this is permeant...and let's not forget the ridiculous hair loss. I am tapering because I figure with the length and amount I've been doing it it's the safest route. Right now I dose 9x a day, with 2g per dose, so around 18g/day. I am just petrified of thought of going through withdrawals based on the terrifying experiences I've read on here. Physical withdrawals I can handle, even the anxiety, but I'm mostly scared of the depression(I read about it causing suicidality)...please anyone with tapering advice/experiences; how long should I taper, what method do you recommend, when should I jump, and how much different will the withdrawals be from jumping at the end of a taper to quitting CT(which I just don't think I could mentally handle",9

My thyroid was barely ""working"" and barely producing hormones, which btw is neccesary for almost every cell in your body and has a direct link to your adrenal gland as well.  They put me on a daily regimen of levothyroxine which is a medicine which helps your thyroid to produce.  I was told this was a life long medication and my thyroid would never ""heal"".  Turns out after quitting Kratom for a while.  My blood test and t3 and t4 results were perfectly normal and fine and this was after I ran out of medication for over a month and a half.  My cortisol levels were back to normal, when on K, they were 3 times the normal lvl.  Mostly from an overworked adrenal gland.  Testosterone is seriously affected as well, but that's for another convo or a previous post.  Extreme, multi joint pain, adrenal fatigue, low sex hormones, tendon and ligament deterioration can all be attributed to long term kratom use.  I'm talking, like me, 4 to 5 years plus is when I really started to feel off physically.  A lot of my current MRI and xrays I have turn out as similar to a person almost twice my age.  Before K, and during most of my time on it, I worked out 6 times a week, looked great and had no problems physically that I was aware of.  Be careful guys with long term use.  K messes up your hormone balance in so many places and truth be told,balanced hormones are one of the most important parts of your biology as a healthy human being.  Just some food for thought.....God Bless u all and stay clean off the sludgy green!",46

This one is for the folks that chose the slow taper route. I started at 35 gpd and have been tapering for 3 1/2 months. Did you experience PAWS during certain drops or towards to end of your taper? Do you feel like that benefited you when you made the final drop?

My acutes are minimal. I‚Äôm now at 4.5 gpd and have been hanging there for the past 2 days. The only acute withdrawal symptom I get is sneezing and some irritability before it‚Äôs time to dose. I sleep fine and no RLS so far. But the lethargy.... FUCK. It‚Äôs an everyday occurrence. When I push myself to get things done, it‚Äôs tolerable. I‚Äôm also experiencing some depression (no anxiety, thank God) and not feeling motivated during my shifts at work. If this is a sign of PAWS, I would honestly feel grateful. Anything to soften the blow and duration of real PAWS when I do decide to make the jump would be a really good thing for me.",3

I was inhaling 4-6 extract shots a day, for basically 4 years.

My life was greyed out - dull. A joyless, miserable insanity for far too long.

Quitting was the furthest thing from easy, sprinkled with multiple relapses. I would quit, panic, repeat.

Life has never, ever, been more beautiful or meaningful. 

200 days ago, I honestly thought I had nothing left to live for anymore. I didn't care if I lived. Things had gotten very, very bad.

I feel a duty to share this, especially for those of you who may be drowning, just like I was.

What has made this quit successful is me putting HARD work in. Shit I definitely didn't want to do at first, and for awhile. 

Some examples: Working out (this gets easier, with time, and, is immeasurably helpful) Wim Hof, eating better. 

Being extremely mindful of what I was/am watching, listening to, reading, etc. Changing up the unhealthy people and places in my life. BOUNDARIES. Filling those spaces in with healthy people, and healthy places.

Music - a ton of it. It has healed my soul so much. 

Therapy. Learning to have empathy and forgiveness for others, and especially for myself. 

Running weekly online group meetings, directly for quitting kratom awareness, and support. Meditating. 

Basically, making big life changes -because nothing changes, if nothing changes. 

None of this is just handed to you if you quit. You have to fight, hard. You have to get sick of your own shit. 

I promise it is incredibly worth it, and possible. 

All of my love to each and every single one of you. Please feel free to directly message me. 

Vulnerability, and community, continue to only save and improve my life. ü§ç",111

I used it for over two years and had read many stories here about quitting and how hard it could be.
At some point I started loosing all emotion for anything that was happening in my life and decided I would taper my dose and quit over a period of time.

Soon enough I found myself having horrible self doubts and negative feelings toward life and my position in the world having just started tapering down dosage.
The negative thoughts would run through my head when I was awake an un occupied, like driving or sitting around on my phone.
Even worse were my thoughts when I was sleeping though, and the weird pain that overtook my back for a few weeks span until I eventually caved and went back to my regular dose.

A few weeks later I tried again, and quit ct before I went to sleep. It was horrible thoughts again and I directly took some as soon as I woke up.

Two days later I attempted quitting at the beginning of the day and worked hard though-out the day. This worked so much better, by the time the night rolled around i fell asleep wore out from work and had about 1/8th the amount of negative thoughts I was experiencing the first two tries at quitting!
Night two, zero negative thoughts, a bit of tossing and turning and that was it!
Now here I am at day 7 and just figured I‚Äôde share my story before I put this all behind me before I let it become the past and quit counting days!

Almost instantly I was able to regain my emotion and happinesses!

I only say all this to let you know it can be hard, it can hurt, and it can be the exact opposite; all for the same person!
Try try try until you find your way, but if you want it enough it will be over for you too!

Best of luck, and lots of coffee is helpful!",2

I can‚Äôt believe that one gram really has that much of an effect on withdrawal... my friends are telling me it‚Äôs placebo but I def feel better after taking a .5 gram dose at the end of the day.

Even though I pushed myself to go to the gym this morning (45 min. On the Eliptical) only planned on 30 min but pushed myself longer once I got to that point. Very happy about that but here's the rest of the day...

Feeling of Lathargy still lingering. Body feels heavy and I can feel every step I take still. 

A little anxious, don't want to sit in one place to long. 

Not super social. I mean, I can carry a conversation but I just stare at the other person as if I want it to end already, lol. 

Motivation and excitement for things still not all the way there. I still do things out of habit since I know ""Motivation"" only takes you so far but whatever I'm doing feels like a daunting task.

Still in a slight haze. Foggy feeling of depression or out of sync with reality. The pink cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è or adhonia as I heard it called still lingering above me.

*Positive side of things*

I was actually able to accomplish things, nothing physically holding me back. So even if I didn't want to do something, still did it. 

Is today better then day 1? Yes! 
Is it better then day 5? Absolutely!! 
Is it better then yesterday? Maybe, but pretty similar so hard to really say. 

Does all this still mean progress? I certainly would like to think so even though my mind tells me otherwise. I just hope I'm not trapped in some type of post kratom hell with no escape üòÑ",3

It wasn‚Äôt until that point that I realized what this shit was doing to me or how dependent I‚Äôd become on it. 

I decided to taper because I couldn‚Äôt take the time off from my life needed to get through the worst if the WDs. I started back up at 3 gpd and cut ~0.1 gpd until I got to 0.5 yesterday. 

I‚Äôm not feeling any negative effects anymore so I may as well just stop. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll feel something that‚Äôs not great, but I think I got through the worst of the WDs. Only one way to find out!

Update #1 - Day 3 
I‚Äôm very surprised that I‚Äôm feeling pretty good. My RLS hasn‚Äôt been bad. Idk why I‚Äôm not having bad withdrawals. Every time I‚Äôve tried to quit the past 10 years I would have withdrawals so bad that i would just go nuts. Idk If this is what is helping me but this what I‚Äôm doing.
Taking vitamin c every couple hours and I take 3 800mg gabapentin a day (prescribed). And plenty of water. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm doing. I feel bad because a lot of you are suffering and I‚Äôm not even though I‚Äôve been taking 30grams a day for 10 years. Also AVOID CAFFIENE! Even ginger ale has caffeine in it.

I have ongoing mental health issues since quitting. Well, to be perfectly honest, since before quitting. I think that something else triggered my anxiety while I was on krarom and then I blamed it on krarom and went off of it, and of course that did not help. 

Anyway, yesterday was a low day for me. I did not sleep the night before and I was miserable the whole day with anxiety and other strange physical sensations (like crawly skin). I drove myself into a very deep hole. And when you are vulnerable like that, thats when the demon creeps in. I convinced myself that if I take a little bit of kratom, I may instantly feel better. At that very moment, if only I had access to krarom, I would have relapsed. I'm convinced of that. The only thing that kept me klean is that I used to order krarom from an online vendor (I never used the head shop stuff, and I don't trust them). It was already evening so I decided to wait till the morning to order it. In the next few hours, my bf and my friends talked me out of it. Then I refocused on other stuff and forgot about it. Now I see how stupid this idea was in the first place. And I would have caved in if only I had anyway to get the stuff. So frigging stupid.

Then yesterday I had my car into the shop. I was standing outside waiting for my lift in 46F weather with sweat pouring down my face. I went to work, but I wasn't able to get my midday dose of kratom because I didn't have my car to drive home.

By the end of the day, I was cold - so cold that I felt frozen to the bone. I went home and stood in the hot shower for like 20 minutes, trying to warm up. Then I thought I'd do an experiment, so I ate 4 grams of kratom - and within an hour I was burning up again! So looks like this stuff has betrayed me.

I also realized it's not giving me the feeling of well-being and contentment like it did at first. This is not my first experience with addiction, so this is starting to look familiar *sigh*

It was fleeting and quickly evaporated as I came home to my still angry wife, but it was there and I could FEEL it. 

It‚Äôs amazing how the kratom high is so fake, so produced. It feels nothing like that small moment of joy I felt today as I rocked with the windows down. Maybe it was just a PAWS mood swing, but I‚Äôll take a swing to the upside after all I‚Äôve been through the past week.

The fact that this isn't happening with Kratom WD is really wearing me down, as I wake up feeling like shit and I know that I will only feel worse as the day progresses. Hearing this, my psychiatrist decided to give me a 10mg ambien prescription for 5 nights (which is good, I do not plan on building another dependence). Does anyone here have experience with ambien for Kratom withdrawals? I used it a few times recreationally in the past and remember it being like a disassociate xanax with some pleasant euphoria.

I just wanted to vent a little bit. I am 18 and I still live with my parents and my brothers. My brothers know I'm a drug addict (30gpd is being a drug addict in my opinion) and it hurts them. I have a job at home depot full time in the parking lot which require a LOT of physical efforts, and which is hard when I'm in withdrawals (jello legs) especially in the morning. And mentally if I wait a bit longer to take my 5g, suicidal thoughts slowly crawl to my head and in the worst cases, I was genuinely crazy ! Laughing about horrible things that pops in my head like killing myself, eating razors blades, etc. Idk if it ever happened to you guys... I am on lexapro to try to cure my depression, and my mom always want to know when I will begin to feel better. The problem is that I can't tell if the medication is working because I am always high on kratom. And I don't want to tell her that I am trying to taper off a drug that act as an opioid, because it would be so hard on her and I hate seeing her and my dad disapointed of me... Especially because I already dropped of C√©gep, (which is like a school just before university we have in Qu√©bec) the first year in because I had no motivation and was coming from a extremely intense toxic relationship (which probably caused my depression), and since it was online school, at home, in my bedroom, alone... my mental health dropped to a point where I was trying every drugs to found the older happy version of myself. (Which was a mistake since hydromorphone was a feeling I have a hard time forgetting. But don't worry I only took it 5 times in the past) And for my self estime, it's hard to just be a loser living with his parents, riding a scooter, taking drugs and watching youtube all days because I'm too afraid to face the reality that is I have to get my shits together and find a job that will relate to the things I like.

I have really struggled with Kratom since I graduated highschool basically. Never thought I would still be having such a hard time but I am at this point where I am afraid to quit as I dont want to lose progress with where I am at with my career. For the first time since I started Kratom, I am having some scary side effects that I believe are pointing at my liver. In 2018, when I first quit after 2 years of use, my liver was swollen and I had high liver enzymes. After about 2 months of being clean, I lost 25 lbs and my liver enzymes went back to normal. Due to severe depression and apathy, I went back to Kratom. I have tried quitting several times since, never longer than a month, but now I get dizzy when I take Kratom and sometimes quite nauseous. Everytime that I have quit before, I quit CT and I believe if I try tapering, I may be able to avoid severe PAWS that leads me back to Kratom. 

I am scared, frustrated, and would do anything to live a happy, Kratom-free life where I could live in the moment. 

Any tips for tapering? I have a capsuling tool and all the supplements suggested. Wish I never started this shit..",2

I've been posting a lot lately but I'm getting beyond desperate. 5 nights now of near-zero sleep, no matter what supplement or helper med I try (trazadone, amitriptyline, benzos, clonidine, gabapentin). Nothing works. Other symptoms (anxiety, depression) have improved already, but the insomnia is a torture test. This is my second quit, and I was only on around 12 gpd over 5 months, tapered down to 4 gpd before jumping, but still this. All I'm looking for is hope - I feel like I've ruined my entire life. I have a really great job starting in 2 weeks, and I will simply not be able to function if I'm like this. Would I be optimistic to say the 2nd week will get more sleep? I don't even need a full night's sleep - I'd do some insane shit just to get 4-5 hours steady sleep at this point.

Edit: It happened! 7 hours of near continuous deep dream-filled beautiful sleep (didn't even get up to pee, which hasn't happened in years). Night 6 was the night. I'm under no illusion that things will be perfect now, but just the relief of a single good sleep is indescribable after 5 days of suffering.

There is finally light at the end of the tunnel. Putting everything I've got into getting out of this kratom trap. If this addictive personality can do it, you can do it. I started using this to avoid feeling negative mental and physical things, but now I can't even feel ok without it.

As many have, I started using kratom, as a harmless and helpful supplement. Years later, I'm a slave to a substance that causes nothing but pain and trouble without it. So, here goes my shot at freedom. I cleared a week of time to detox because I relapsed after 3 days the last time I tried. And I can't taper (not my personality). Due to the horrible detox symptoms, I couldn't function to even get my basic needs taken care of. 

Clearing this ""vacation time"" took a lot of preparation, friends. And it's going to be worth it. I finally got outside today, and finally didn't have to sit down to even take a pee (that was very unnatural, humiliating, and demotivating for this guy).

These last 4 days have been horrible, both mentally and physically. It took almost everything I had to get this far, but it gets better. I feel like my brain and soul have nothing to work with, without kratom. But today, I'm walking around again. And had a few laughs with my girlfriend about this not-funny experience. 

Keeping what God wants for me and my kids close to heart, I will keep up this struggle. Today I feel comforted that life and feeling isn't lost forever. I wish and pray the best for all of you on this road with me. There is a good life waiting after suffering through the kratom lie and catastrophe.",8

It's day 18 of no K for me and it feels good. I'm not going to say it's all sunshine and rainbows yet, but it's 100 percent better than being addicted to such a shit substance. 

My sleep is still sporadic. I can go to sleep just fine at night, but usually wake up sometime around 2 am with a bit of anxiety and have trouble getting back to sleep. I keep some Valerian root extract by my bed and will do a quick Wim Hoff breathing session which usually helps me get a few more hours of sleep. I credit it mostly to anxiety...not sure if it's just my body still isn't used to sleeping without Kratom or if it's legit reasons to be anxious keeping me up, or a combination. There are a lot of changes coming up in my life, many will be for the better, but regardless, change always strikes some fear in me, and being that I am naturally prone to anxiety, it all makes logical sense to me.

I'm still a little groggy and ""cold"" in the mornings. It's not unbearable, but I notice it still. I also still have some random sneezing fits throughout the day. Again, everything has been manageable. My mood has been way better. I feel more at peace throughout the day. I'm engaging in more spontaneous conversations with neighbors, coworkers, reaching out to friends, family....I even have a wedding coming up that I am actually excited to go to, which I know absolutely would not be the case if I were still shoveling K down my throat. I'm ready to live life again and I'm excited about the upcoming possibilities. I'm currently working remote while listening to the sounds of some good old 80 rock for the nostalgia factor, and can truly feel the music. 

My motivation to get started on a new task is still kind of meh, so I kind of have to force myself to get started. This might not be all K, I think the motivation aspect was one of the reasons I went on K in the first place, along with the sleep and anti-anxiety ""benefits"". I put ""benefits"" in quotes because most of all these were very short lived until the K made me a shell of a person. I attribute most of these lingering issues to being issues I've kind of always dealt with, possible exasperated by the fact that I'm maybe about 90 percent recovered right now after the Kratom abuse. 

Anyways, besides the long journal post, I wanted to thank the members of this forum who were there to assist me during my worst moments. There were several time I wanted to say F it and shove down some green sludge down my throat for some temporary relief, but I have fought those urges and feel like I am on my way to being me again. I know it's clich√©, but for those of you debating quitting, it can be done, and while withdrawal really sucks ass, you can get through it. I wasn't on the highest dose on here, but I wasn't on the lowest either...somewhere in the middle. From my anecdotal experience, the parts of withdrawal that seem absolutely unbearable are relatively short compared to the nagging/lingering aspects that are more manageable, but you only can get make it to the finish line if you commit to not using ever again. Past quits I get back on the K at day 7 and day 10 because I was ""Out of the acute stage"" and could ""manage my use this time"", but that is absolute bullshit. The devil loses power over you the more times you deny his advances. Every offering by the devil is designed to steal your soul and the only way to get your soul back is to tell him to fuck off for good.",7

I hope that everybody is doing well on their journeys. I love this wonderful community and I would appreciate if you guys let me know what you think. I would REALLY appreciate any input. 

Brief background: 5 weeks ct today from 11 months at up to 20gpd. I tapered off low, and some classic wd symptoms early on but they went away by the 2 weeks ct. 

At 2 weeks ct, I decided I needed help with anxiety and lack of motivation, and my psych put me on Prozac. Shortly after starting prozac, things started going downhill. My anxiety gradually rose, I gradually got more and more restless, jittery, hot (I was always cold before prozac), anxiety got into panic and I stopped sleeping at night. I got unsettling inner restlessness that gradually become unbearable. I also got these creepy crawly sensations on my skin, mostly upper arms, shoulders and back, it feels like pins and needles. It especially tends to come when I am still. My appetite become non existent. 

By 2 weeks on prozac, and by 4 weeks ct, all this stuff turned unbearable. I was nonfunctional. So I phoned my psych and he said to quit prozac. I've been off of it for 1 week and it seems that the situation has improved a little. I'm functioning most of the time, im not disabled by all this, but I'm still bad. Now it seems to come in waves too, usually in the first half of the day im suffering and in the PM it lets up. Until yesterday was able to get some decent sleep on meds (trazodone and propanolol), but last night only got 2 hours. I have klonopin which I only took twice in the past 2 weeks. I do NOT want to take klonopin, but I only take it when everything else fails. 

I would like to know if it is prozac doing this or paws? Since all this seem to have started with prozac and already seem to have gotten a little better in 1 week off prozac, I kinda think it is prozac. But I can't discount paws either. I know technically both prozac and paws can cause these symptoms. Please let me know if anyone maybe been through something similar or has any input. Thanks so much and all the best to everyone!!! You guys and gals are AMAZING!",3

I think the first time I took like a 1/4 or 1/3 cup scoop, mixed with water and sipped. Ended up puking and concerned. Didn‚Äôt stop me. Eventually, nightly use became a thing with around 6 grams usually a night, even sometimes up to like probably 12+.

I honestly don‚Äôt know.

Somewhere around a month ago I was listening to music, smoked some weed, and BOOM withdraw. I was so blind sighted I thought I was genuinely having a panic attack, reality seemed fake, hot cold sweating shakes you name it I had it.

At this time I think I was taking like 3 grams in the morning, 3 grams before work, and then maybe at least 3-6 grams when I got home.

Continued that for about another month until I felt like I was just feeling delusional all the time, cognitive function slowed, forgetting shit, can‚Äôt focus, in and out of reality & almost feeling like I was gonna have a seizure panic attack every day. Tachycardia was bad along with hypertension.

Finally bit the bullet and decided to taper off.

I did I think a pretty bizarre taper, I just said fuck it and compared it to alcohol taper I did about 7 months ago.

Gave myself 3 days, 1.5G doses every 4 hours to keep the extreme anxiety and shakes and all the mental that comes with it away.

That ended up being sporadic due to just trying to go as long as I could without taking a dose before giving in, and things like being at work not being able to dose and waking up dying in the night and took one 1 gram dose on like day 2 in the middle of the night.

So my taper was only two days, and after reading so many experiences, i think I understand why my symptoms have been so severe vs a truly scheduled out gradual taper.

But in my past vices of heroin and alcohol, I seem to push it as far as I can, taper just a bit to where I can manage, and let it ride out.

The past 7 days have been hell. I have found god in my own understanding. Starting to accept me for me and take the right path finally.

I feel mostly normal? Lol. Definitely still battling body anxiety and anhedonia. Feeli g pleasure is tough right now. But thank god I have the opportunity to sit my ass home with my loving family that mostly understands the situation, not their first time unfortunately üòì

What‚Äôs helped me:
‚Ä¢yoga
‚Ä¢meditation
‚Ä¢music if you can stand the stimulation
‚Ä¢at least doing one thing you feel is slightly productive, even if you just hang on in agony the rest of the day lmao
‚Ä¢being near people that love you unconditionally and aren‚Äôt pressuring you, if you can.
‚Ä¢posting and reading on here
‚Ä¢TELL PEOPLE - this was hard for me during heroin, I told no one until it was too late. This time I realized my situation, scared for my life, and told my friends and family along with my job. I tried to just play the I‚Äôm sick card with them but said fuck it and gave them my history and they told me to recover however I need to and I‚Äôll be welcomed back with opened arms when I‚Äôm ready. It has tremendously helped with not feeling alone, AND you get SUPPORT FROM OTHERS. Feels quite nice instead of stuck in your head.

Supplements / herb medicine
‚Ä¢weed - tricky one. During my acutes it was definitely making everything worse, but gave my body slight comfort. Increased delusions and depression, but helped me sleep and relax if that makes sense. The mind is wildly resilient. I did however not smoke nearly as much as I‚Äôm used to, I‚Äôm talking baby hits. To find that fine line of help or too much. Let‚Äôs just say I took a dab and was glad I was with family, negative symptoms got bad.

‚Ä¢ magnesium helped truly allow me to just lay still in bed and somewhat relax, but insomnia was still strong. Weed somewhat helps.

‚Ä¢coffee - also tricky, it would help me feel a bit happy and energetic, confident, and do some things I needed to do.

‚Ä¢nicotine - let‚Äôs be real with this one, I feel like it‚Äôs hard for a lot of people to quote nicotine unless forced to or truly ready to. I‚Äôm just not ready to plain and honest, maybe once I get back to somewhat baseline. As in terms of helping, sometimes it grounded me and sometimes it seemed like it did nothing much at all, but I‚Äôve felt that way mostly for a while now vaping.

All in all, idk man find what actually helps you and works for you, I‚Äôm just sharing my journey so far.

Be mindful of your actions and why you‚Äôre doing it before just doing it, especially if you want to use a supplement to help with some relief until you bounce back.

Time to build some helpful natural coping skills to deal with life on life‚Äôs terms, hopefully üôè I have faith ‚ù§Ô∏è

Oh and never say never, I said that years ago when I quote heroin, then got addicted to alcohol, quit that and then came back home after a break up (where my heroin addiction started) and almost immediately just used Kratom as an organic safe route thing, you know how it goes at this point.

I‚Äôm always just one action away from making the wrong choice, but also one action away from the right direction to better my life. Build up those right choices until it becomes your lifestyle.

I‚Äôll probably always be addicted to something in one form or fashion, it‚Äôs a part of who I am, but I truly need to learn moderation in all aspects of my life.

Even if I go to gardening, working out, etc, I can still be just as addicted to the actions and  money spending aspect. I‚Äôm sure you all know what I mean.


Alas, have a great day everyone, love yourself and you can love the world ‚ù§Ô∏è that‚Äôs all we really need, and food and water lmao.",25

The withdrawals have sucked but oddly enough I'm not craving kratom at all. I'm still incredibly restless, but unmotivated to do anything. My sleep is garbage and I feel depressed. I'm really banking on these symptoms going away soon. Through a bunch of reflecting, I've realized that I've been using kratom as an escape. For almost 2 years I've been taking 15-20 grams a day, when I was being ""responsible"" with it, and up to 30 grams when I was really wanting an escape.   


My ex and I broke up almost 2 years ago. We were together for 9 years but it was an amicable break up. Right after we broke up I've been numbing myself with kratom without realizing it. I then got on a SSRI and Adderall about a year ago. Taking those 3 made me feel super indifferent towards everything so my drinking got worse this last year. I quit the SSRIs and Adderall at the end of February this year and felt much better. Something still felt off though so I decided to stop taking kratom as well. It's been an incredibly rough week. I've noticed since I started taking kratom, I consume something whenever I feel any sort of discomfort, whether it be physical or mental. Learning to just accept how I'm feeling and that I need to ride it out has been super difficult. The last thing I need to cut out is booze. I've been drunk twice and buzzed once since I stopped taking kratom, and while it helps with anxiety in the moment, it makes me feel so much worse the next day.

I'm just curious what the WDs are like at this point. I know I'll have some, but hoping it's minimal. I've experienced WDs over the past month as I lowered each dose, but nothing couldn't handle. Much more manageable than CT for me.",4

Kratom kept me in a fugue, where I never had to deal with my traumas, emotions, etc. It kept me numb or occasionally euphoric, without ever having to work for it. It allowed me to become complacent with anything and everything that happened, without having to process it. The physical WDs aren't the biggest part for me. It's waking up after 6+ months of daily use of this drug, seeing all of the things I avoided just waiting for me. They're all here now, and for me, this is the hardest part of stopping my addiction. I became an addict because I run from my problems. This has historically been my MO. For most of my life I spent all of my time gaming or other things that otherwise allowed me to stay asleep to my emotional problems. Kratom allowed me to do it much easier than I'd ever been able to before, with a ""feel good"" bonus on top. It was the perfect escape. I didn't know at the time that I ran from my problems when I started kratom, I only see that now. So the importance in me quitting isn't just stopping my dependence on a substance to feel good, it's going through everything I avoided, processing it. It's changing the habits that I've clung to my entire life of avoidance, whether subconsciously or knowingly. It's like growing up again. I feel very weak, sad, and I've cried for most of my withdrawals. I have wanted to go back into my numbness, other times I am adamant about change. In the past, I have tried to change. I've gone to therapy, but I've never really committed myself. I never let the barrier down long enough to feel anything, and thus begin healing from all of the things I've been through. I have failed a lot. I don't want to continue to fail myself. Quitting kratom isn't just about stopping a drug, it's about a lifestyle and a mindset change. It's about healing myself and teaching myself healthier ways to cope, so I can finally live.

I hope anyone going through this keeps going. It sucks. It sucks really bad. This is the worst thing I've ever felt, and it would be so easy to ""fall asleep"" again. But please give yourself a chance to break the cycle, and try your best. There's a lot more in life than what we have given (or not given) to ourselves.",19

Man, this is tough. I don't know quite how to describe it. I've been through real opiate withdrawal from Oxy and while this is milder (I barely have any flu-ish symptoms) the restlessness, depression and anxiety almost seem worse. It feels like my body is just about to explode and I really have a dark cloud hanging over me. Of course, I keep reminding myself that this is temporary, and the only way to not feel like this again is to keep going. I also have a weed smoking habit that I want to kick now too, but I settled for getting a high-cbd pen with some THC to help make WD more bearable. Don't think I could handle CT'ing weed at the same time, as I get some WD symptoms from that too. I was also just wondering if anyone could help me figure out how long I can expect to feel this way? I used kratom only a couple times a week for most of the last year, then about four months ago I started on 10-15 gpd. I was on that for about two months then I was able to quit for a week with much less WD symptoms. Unfortunately, after that week, I gave into thinking I could just use once or twice and soon I was up to 20-25 gpd, which I would say I was doing for about two more months until I tapered to 12 gpd over a few days before going CT yesterday. So to summarize, probably about 4-4.5 total months of use, 10-15 gpd at first for two months, then the week off before going up to 20-25 gpd for another two months. Do you think I can expect my symptoms to clear up a little quicker than some people who've been on for longer? Sorry for the rambling post, trying to organize my thoughts is difficult rn!",3
2021-05-16 22:17:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ne47mf/digestive_destruction_im_done/,"Digestive Destruction, I'm DONE!","Hello everyone, I have not been active in this reddit for over 4 years.. That was the last time I tried to quit. 

February of 2017, as soon as I quit I turned to alcohol to cope. To keep a very, very, very long story short.. I drank so much one night in a club that I blacked out, stole a car, drove around all night looking for my girlfriend at the time (she went home with another man), somehow obtained methamphetamines, which was followed by a very bad police chase consequently ending in 4 totalled police cars and my (stolen) car totaled as well. I survived despite being shot at (obviously they had to use lethal force against me). 

I spent almost years in prison, a miracle in and of itself I received such a small sentence. The judge said he saw potential in me, and genuine regret. After getting out what did I do? I went right back to Kratom. Even re-reading that last sentence makes me feel so stupid and sick to my stomach. That I would have even considered making that choice.. This truly is my disease. 

I've taken kratom every day for almost three years now. Approximately 6g each dose 4-5 times a day. Miraculously I turned my entire life around, learned a trade, worked my way up, started living on my own, paying all my bills. Things that as a distracted drug addict I was never able to do.

All is good right? Well not really, aside from consuming about 1lb of kratom a month, spending LOTS of time preparing it ahead of time each week using oblate discs, barely having any kind of short term memory capabilities, and constantly feeling like my head is in the f*cking clouds, I began to have really bad constipation issues. It got so bad that I woke up in so much pain one night that I ended up in the ER severely backed up. At this point my intestines were at risk of a rupture. Did I stop? You guys know the answer to that. I tried everything in the book to relieve the constipation, some things helped a little, just about everything else did nothing for me. I ended up finding a medication called Motegrity. It did not fix all my problems but it helped enough for me to... maintain. 

The discomfort continues, week after week, month after month, until I finally decided enough is enough. I finally decided to listen to my body, it's telling me if I don't stop now something really bad will develop/happen as a result. The constantly bulging/uncomfortable stomach feeling has gotten to me. I don't want to depend on kratom or some stupid prescription for constipation, or anything else in regards to this matter. I took the week off work this week to give myself the best shot possible here. You all help motivate me, and knowing there are people within this group that have faced this and come out on top pushes me to do it even more.

For anyone that is on this journey with me, thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this. I've never written anything like this in my entire life, but it feels good to open up to a group that I know won't just dismiss me as a criminal, scumbag, drug addict, loser. I am so much more than that. And I'm pretty sure you all are too. Thank you all. üôè",8

At my worst I was taking 3 extract shots a day, that was last year. More recently after my relapse, I‚Äôve been taking one a day with some days off in between depending on money. It‚Äôs sort of an accidental taper.

Here‚Äôs the thing, I landed an amazing job creating videos and writing scripts for popular online YouTube videos. This is why I‚Äôm screwed - I have officially run out of money, and there is no way I can produce videos up to the caliber I know I‚Äôm capable of while I‚Äôm withdrawing. I‚Äôm absolutely terrified I‚Äôm going to lose this opportunity.

Nothing anyone does will help me. I wanted to work with them for so long, and now I think I ruined it. I‚Äôm going to be destroyed if I lose it. I have nothing going for me in life right now (no job no cash still living at home) and although I know that will change, this was the only thing that made me happy And proud. I‚Äôd give anything just to be able to finish this freaking video while on kratom just to secure this job and say goodbye forever as soon as I finish. I know I‚Äôm done with it and I have it in me for this to be my final quit. I just am so anxious and depressed at the prospect of destroying my opportunity. There‚Äôs a difference between just getting the videos done, and actually making them good. Sweating my balls off while extremely depressed isn‚Äôt really the recipe for good content.

I woke up and am still having all the physical symptoms but my depression/anxiety is gone now. I am pretty confident that in a couple days I will be back to normal. Here‚Äôs what I did:

Was using 20-30 gpd for about a year and a half. In a week‚Äôs time I tapered from 25 gpd down to 3 grams yesterday morning. This sent me into full acute withdrawal on Friday (7 grams) and it was nice to get the acute quits out of the way over the weekend. I packed my weekend full of plans with friends/my girlfriend and lots of time at the gym. I worked out like an absolute fiend and just went into David Goggins style savage mode. 

This is my second time in kratom wd and this time I had been using for much longer and at a much higher dosage per day. This time I have done a *much* better job at this withdrawal thing and it all comes to down to mindset/psychology. I‚Äôve realized the key to kicking kratom is just to view wd the same way a Navy Seal would. Just become absolutely relentless and fearless, and remember to treat withdrawal as a beautiful spiritual experience. Whether or not you know this yet, this experience will benefit you mentally in the future. **Remember, most of withdrawal is mental**. There are plenty of stories of people being hooked on heroin and having little to no withdrawal symptoms when they change their environment/mindset. I truly believe the key to withdrawal is making sure you don‚Äôt underestimate/baby yourself and just lay on the couch and wallow in your misery.

Remember, being negative is **NOT** helping you in this. Go out and go for a run, do some push-ups if you‚Äôre deep in the shit. IDC if it‚Äôs the middle of the night. **Remember, this is YOUR body. YOU make the rules and YOU get to make kratom your bitch**.

Crazy side note: I had a wet dream last night for the first time in my life. This is definitely evidence of my testosterone shooting back up after being suppressed by kratom for so long. I‚Äôm definitely excited to get my physique and sex drive back that kratom seemed to have stifled for the last 18 months!",5

Each time I‚Äôve eventually hit a certain point and said ‚Äúyeah, no more of that.‚Äù Sometimes this was because I didn‚Äôt like the compulsiveness it brought out in me, other times it was because the kratom itself was making me feel sick/headachy. In any case, I never really had much of an issue quitting ct. 

Recently I‚Äôve been using the stuff again, and I think I may have been taking taking more than I realized. I wouldn‚Äôt really measure it out, or keep track of how many doses per day. There were days where I didn‚Äôt take any, and it never lead to any issues, but those days have become less and less frequent. All in all, it‚Äôs been about a month since I started taking the stuff again.

The last dose I took was on Thursday evening. I was at my office, and when I left I didn‚Äôt bring the kratom home with me. On Friday I felt out of it, and it occurred to me that this was kratom related, but it still didn‚Äôt seem like much. Saturday I wake up and I‚Äôm feeling achey, before too long I‚Äôm congested and my airways are irritated. Now granted, this was also one of my first days spending a large amount of time outside un-masked so perhaps allergies were playing a role as well. But that night I started getting hot flashes and sweats. Nothing extreme, mind you. My second Pfizer dose was much worse. But it was enough to worry me! 

It‚Äôs Sunday night as I‚Äôm writing this, and I feel quite a bit better than I did yesterday, although I‚Äôm still getting some weird hot/sweaty sensations and my airways seem more easily irritated than usual. 

This sub has been really useful. If I didn‚Äôt have access to all this info I would have probably dismissed the past few days as a mild cold or allergies.

2021-05-16 15:26:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ndvt5w/question_about_tinnitus/,Question about tinnitus.,"So, I made it almost 4 weeks before I caved 5 days ago. I bought a small shot bottle of kratom from the gas station. That night, my tinnitus got worse and I was back to the grind of quitting. Tinnitus was a huge reason why I quit, and continues to be a blessing and a curse.

Upon some research I came across it appears that tinnitus does occur from kratom use. Many users have a variety of results when they quit. Some say their tinnitus went away within a week, others like me say they still have it after being sober for so long. Some of the research I've done, users reported going into the doctors office and getting scans done on their inner ear. They all reported no structural damage to the inner ear from the scans. This is interesting, because it may be related to what is going on in the brain. One theory from a medical student on this page stated that withdrawing from ssri's can cause tinnitus and may relate to the reason why kratom gives tinnitus as it also affects serotonin receptors to some extent. 

So my question is, will this ever go away? How long did it take for other users on this forum suffering from the same symptom for it to go away? What exactly is causing the tinnitus? Actual research is hard to come by for kratom and I can only rely on anecdotal reports and its frustrating because I don't know why I'm still having issues with tinnitus and I don't want to deal with this for the rest of my life.",7

Do you think that would make the withdrawal any less painful?  Would I be better off trying to taper with kratom instead?  Or should I just stop being a bitch and CT?

The problem that I always end up running into is that I'm so miserable after quitting that I end up relapsing.

Back months ago if I skipped a day I was fine, but more recently I skipped a day and woke up in WD for the first time, had a bad racing heart and RLS. Even if i skipped a nighttime dose I would get the withdrawals which started to feel like a flu.

&#x200B;

I cut my dose in half with no issue, 2 doses at night rather than 4 across the day, and quickly tapered down to 1 dose (1/4 original dose) at night. Due to some unforeseen circumstances I've had to jump from that dose 3 days ago. First day off I had a wave of sadness and emotions which I wasnt able to keep at bay like I would like the kratom, the start of some physical nervousness, and had poor quality sleep. Woke up on day 2 absolutely lethargic. One of my side effects of kratom was constant lethargy but this lethargy was at least 3x as bad, like I could barely get out of bed. Normally I'm sensitive to caffeine but Ive been going through like 200+mg in the morning and barely feeling it. Work was hard, completely exhausted and also was freezing/shivering even though it wasnt cold. Night 2 started getting bad RLS, thank god Im prescribed a ton of gabapentin, though I dont take it daily. Woke up 2 hours after sleeping woke up all restless and stacked gabapentin till i slept through the night (1500 or 2100mg or smth). Woke up day 3 similarly fatigued, but I started megadosing vitamin C on night 2 and the flu symptoms were a little better. Less tired at work and have had some periods of good spirits. oddly enough still constipated through day 2, stool got softer on day 3 but still no diarrhea. I was shitting rocks on kratom and was worried I'd have an intestinal blockage sooner or later.

&#x200B;

Overall this WD hasnt been as bad as the WD I'd get skipping a dose when I was eating 40 grams a day; Been running every night before bed which has helped but not enough to stave off the RLS. Thank god for my gabas. I'm really trying to be sober this time but by now the urges to get high on anything have returned. Been thinking about how good a dose of kratom would feel with the time off my tolerance but I cant take it. If I end up with PAWS and am able to I may finish my taper later on, but rn I'm determined to stay off it and heal. After xanax/klonopin withdrawal I vowed to never WD off anything ever again but here we are. at least it's not as bad as that wd. 

&#x200B;

Supplements Ive used: magnesium glycinate, b complex, vitamin c megadoses, NAC, zinc, agmatine, l-tyrosine, ashwagandha, d3+k2. Hard to tell what's really working cuz in wd I like to throw whatever I can at the symptoms.

I have attempted stopping before and was dealing with severe arm spasms at night as well as insomnia, anxiety, and diahria. 
To avoid these I want to weane myself off of it and not CT as I cherish my sleep. 
I've been doing a lot of reading on here and people advise to go on walks, go to the gym, or meditate but as I already do all of that does anyone have any other suggestions?
I basically got into kratom as a replacement for alcohol and weed but now I regret it as the withdrawals are soooo very difficult. 
I have previously gotten through 72 hours when I ran out but I could not get any sleep for two nights so Idk how I'll be able to manage with CT. 
I am making a plan to reduce my consumption as my body will react better to that.
My problem with kratom is that it is only bad for me when I don't take it. When I am on it I tend to be much more productive but I need to stop. (I hate how I try to justify it)
I notice for me that it doesn't take away from my daily life but I know I need to stop as I hate being dependant on anything. 
What are tips people have for getting through the nights as that is my biggest problem...
I cannot smoke weed currently but after a few weeks I will be able to and I'm sure that will greatly help me to stop as it can put me to sleep.

I'm 22, and in high school had a serious problem with opiates and benzos. I was an addict in denial for a long time, until finally, after living alone during a gap year before college, I realized that substances are a dead end for me. I could force myself to stay off pills, but then daily weed smoking fucked me up almost as much. since then, I have got 6 months of sobriety twice, followed by long relapses. My last relapse was about a year ago, and Ive been going strong on weed and kratom ever since. I had myself up to like 20-25 gpd the last month, and have been tapering for a few days. today is day one of cold turkey, and I feel very emotionally and physically unstable. I plan on smoking some weed tonight to allow for some eating and sleep, but that needs to stop as well. Will probably use cbd to help get off that, but I'm not gonna worry about that today (or at least try not to.) Going to text my sponsor too.

I was shocked to be feeling this way on day 5, cause anytime I‚Äôve gotten off other opiates by day 5 I was feeling a lot better. But not this time, maybe it‚Äôs because I came off such a high dose to virtually nothing? I‚Äôm not sure, but I have to stable this out because I‚Äôm losing my mind. 

I could easily deal with another 3-4 days of severe discomfort if I can use a significantly lower dose between now and jumping back in. I also think if I can gradually reduce my dose over the next week and half by the time I get to that phase jumping off 4gpd will be, I hope, a lot less painful and perhaps not as long lasting. From what I‚Äôve read the most tolerable WD side effects have been by doing some sort of a taper. 

The question always is about discipline, of course.  But I do believe that I can be disciplined about going down gradually from here. I can manage the lesser side effects, it‚Äôs just when that it gets to be day 5 of pure hell that I start to really fall apart. 

For example I‚Äôve managed to sit through 5 days of torture with 120 grams sitting right next to me, and refrained from using anything but a micro dose of my normal daily intake. Idk. I hope I‚Äôm not kidding myslef, but I do find I can cope much better with the minor symptoms much better than the hard core feeling off jumping off 55gpd to nothing. 

This feed has been my life blood, and I am fully committed to this process. I also do feel like I need to get my supplements in slightly better order before making the full jump. 

So yes this sucks I made it this far and now am switching to little more drawn out taper. Please let me know what you guys think? Is it easier to jump off 5g a day (I.e. less intense / lessened amount of time for severe WD effects) or is it all just going to be the exact same and essentially I‚Äôve just screwed myself by taking jumping up to 14g , which feels relatively stable considering I was on 55gpd 5 days ago. 

Anyway, sorry for rambling... just want to be able to actually make it through this! You guys are the best!",4

I‚Äôve been off 96 days now. I was on some form of opioid including Kratom for 9 years. My case is not super simple and I know that PAWS is not the only thing that is causing my anhedonia. Prior to quitting I had a major depressive episode, quitting Kratom was essential to getting me out of my depression. Getting off Kratom was extremely difficult as I discovered I had many underlying health issues that were not being treated and am recovering from getting off medications, Kratom, as well as physical health issues. I am not sure what is causing what but I am determined to get better even though I have no idea how or when that will happen. Sleep is so essential to my recovery, I take supplements, eat well, keep a regulated schedule, have consulted with different types of medical and alternative doctors and made behavioral changes. I have seen some improvements but I still feel flat and empty. I have absolutely no desire to ever go back to kratom. Ever. But life without pleasure is exhausting. Truly, it is so exhausting. Can anyone relate? What helped you power through to re ignite with that spark?",9

I was hitting the gym 5 days a week, socializing more, the color in my face was going back to normal, no longer looked like a walking zombie, it was great. Unfortunately I let my mind get the best of me, and I‚Äôm sure this has happened to countless others.

My usual kratom daily dose was 100gpd+ up to 200gpd. At around 7:30 I still felt kinda crazy so I ate two spoons of kratom. I calmed down and went to sleep.

I woke up at 5am, took 4mg sub. At 7am I took another 2mg and around 11am I ate a spoon of kratom. It's 1:10pm now and I plan on taking 6mg sub before bedtime with either one spoon or no kratom depending on my mental state.

Tomorrow morning I plan on taking 6mg or 8mg in the morning and no kratom from there on out. I suffer from depression with psychotic features, mainly delusions of persecution, and depersonalization/derealization with generalized anxiety disorder and my mental state is poor but I'm making it.

Edit: I'm out of work until Tuesday for a messed up shoulder. Currently taking prednisone for it. Not sure what's wrong with it, can't lift it and my shoulder and left chest skin is completely numb. So I have some time to figure this out

Edit 2: this dose of kratom physically feels similar to my usual kratom doses without the mental relief, I'm not buzzed or high by any means

I found nothing truly negative about it through countless articles. I took about 10 - 20 grams per day for almost 2 years. I got sick about a year ago and didn‚Äôt take kratom for a week. When I was ready to go back to work I had a panic attack which I contributed to the sickness and taking cold medicine. I never had an anxiety disorder or panic attack in my life before this. After that I continued my Kratom use. Towards the end I started noticing that the world just doesn‚Äôt seem the same, it seems less real but I still didn‚Äôt contribute it to Kratom because I did my research in the beginning. About a month ago I didn‚Äôt take Kratom for a couple of days and had a full blow panic attack, heart pounding hard, shortness of breath, dizzy and I went to the ER. Once that happened I was convinced something was wrong with my heart and I stopped all of my vices at once. No caffeine, no nicotine and no Kratom. I still didn‚Äôt attribute it to Kratom. I had severe anxiety for the first week and then it all subsided. I had intense derealization episodes happen out of nowhere. I still didn‚Äôt contribute it to Kratom. I started having constant imbalance and dizziness/vertigo out of nowhere. This lasted for a week or so and I still have them to this day, just not as intense. I still didn‚Äôt even consider Kratom as the cause. I honestly thought something was wrong with me mentally, like something just broke out of nowhere. I have bright light sensitivity now and ‚Äúfloaters‚Äù in my eyes from time to time. I‚Äôve been checked fully by doctors but not a single thing was wrong except high blood pressure so I‚Äôm on meds for that now. The problem still persists. I was fully healthy both physically and mentally my whole life. I just found this Reddit page and read of people going through withdrawal symptoms that sound eerily close to mine. I‚Äôm hoping you guys can confirm that these are symptoms of Kratom withdrawal because I now feel confident that is what is happening to me. It‚Äôs the only thing that I can contribute to what happened to me. I‚Äôm amazed it‚Äôs lasted a month. I had no idea Kratom could do all of this if you stop taking it. I went through all of this without even considering it was Kratom because I honestly thought there were no serious side effects. 

I would attribute the imbalance and dizziness to high blood pressure but it was constant and all day long. Not getting up fast or sitting down, it was all the time.",7

After reading for years how safe and non-addictive kratom was I was fed up and tapered for 3 months til nothing and withdrawal was still very difficult. Horrible insomnia, valerian herbal hot baths to keep my legs from shaking before attempting to sleep. Maybe 3 difficult nights but then the worst was over. The first night I was shaking in bed like i was possessed. It was scary. But you can do it too. I did kratom for about 4 years. Sharing it with a friend once in awhile. Then i noticed how I slept like a baby on those nights and thought I'd discovered a panacea. I heard ""don't do it every night"" so I did it 2 times a week. Then 3 times a week. Then every night. I slept good. i felt good. I felt warm and calm. A year or so with only my dose at night to sleep. A few years in I noticed I couldn't take a late afternoon nap because my arms were restless. So a small teaspoon of kratom fixed that and i had restful naps. In the last year i noticed i was sitting in a theatre and my legs started quivering and I could barely sit still. After that i did a teaspoon before I'd go to see a play or movie. Then I realized the complete terror of packing kratom, hiding it in my luggage to travel. I wasn't sure of what the laws were. Would i be arrested? Flying to Europe carrying kratom made me realize this sucks. Of course I couldn't bear the long flight without a big dose (powder in water) in the mens room before the flight. The last straw was waking up at 3 a.m. and needing a 2nd sleep dose and then another little dose at 7 a.m. to be able to sleep in the morning. I felt enslaved by kratom. Addicted. It's been 2 years with nothing. I still, have some insomnia but I feel proud that i did it. I even went to a rehab clinic hoping for a drug to ease the withdrawals in my taper but they turned me away since they realized I just wanted drugs. I felt like a crazed animal that day. Life can be painful, boring or peaceful and beautiful. We just have to learn how to live through all of those moments without kratom or drugs or alcohol. It is possible and advisable. Maybe to relieve terrible pain it is worth it. But just to do kratom to feel good and warm or help you sleep is a very dangerous habit. You can quit if you really want to. Good luck. Keep busy.

I've tried all the supplements, melatonin, magnesium, valerian, 5htp, lemon balm, Passion flower, chamomile, even some unisom, nothinggg. I maybe have had like 2 nights of okay sleep in the last month. And by that  I mean like 6 or 7 hours broken up. Even on those days though I still wake up feeling pretty out of it in the head. Am I permanently fucked or is this just paws? Mind you I suffered from mild insomnia already before kratom but this is nothing compared to that.",6

Yesterday & today Ive hit an extreme fatigue/ mood swings wall. 0 cravings for green sludge, hate that crap & will never go back. Yesterday & today, Ive also had anxiety. Crippling fatigue. Supplements are not helping, caffeine doesn‚Äôt do anything. 
Green sludge wd‚Äôs def aint linear! My goodness! Its ground & pound time, Im in for the long haul. 
I just booked an appointment with my endocrinologist, bloodwork is getting pulled Monday afternoon. Im a female in my 30s, I am a huge supporter of all TRT/HRT protocols from endocrinologists.  
My plan this entire time was taper/CT @ home. Which I completed successfully. Plan B was medical detox I had on standby. Which I didnt need. & Lastly & final, if I had Paws or the like, 3 month TRT/HRT if applicable. 
I took 3 weeks off from work, taper to CT. I succeeded. However, this extreme fatigue phase if it lingers will really set me back. I have no more vacation time to be this tired. The past two days has been the most shocking for me. Not to sound naive, but its true. I though nutrition & gym, sauna, supplements would carry me. I dont know yall. Ill pull bloodwork Monday & Im very curious to see what it reads. My endocrinologist said I have to fast & be 19-21 days out from my last menstrual cycle. Which I am. My last bloodwork in Jan was perfect, def curious to see what it says now. 
What have yall done for PAWS? Anyone have suggestions? Its so widely varied individually! I even searched previous ‚Äúday 21 & PAWS‚Äù posts via group top toolbar. Seems to be a waiting game for time to pass.
I am on the struggle bus past two days lol.

Like many of you I get horrible RLS from withdrawals. I get it in my whole body. If i don‚Äôt have a big enough dose before bed it will kick in while I sleep. Im so sick of having this dependence. I take between 70-90 gpd so its bad. 

I read that a lot of you have used gabapentin to help with rls. Im going to talk to my Doctor about it. I don‚Äôt think I would be able to do it without

My question is how did you use it and for how long without developing another dependence? Also does it help if tapering or generally only for cold turkey/jumping off?

Thank you!!",2
2021-05-14 15:42:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nch5aq/one_year_kratom_free_story_tips/,"One Year Kratom Free , story + tips","Hello, I have been one year Kratom free as of April 1st, 2021. I used Kratom for about 6.5 years. The thing that finally tipped me over the edge was hitting rock bottom at the beginning of the whole Covid 19 thing. 
I was fired from my job, and stuck at home.. Before being fired I was already feeling burnt out and struggling with mental issues. Hitting rock bottom made me snap, I knew that Kratom was the cause of many of my problems and decided it was time. I cold turkey'd it. It sucked. But I made it through constantly reminding myself that its short term pain for a life time of freedom.

Some of the side effects that I experienced during withdrawl and months after were irregular heart beat, trouble sleeping, diarrhea, fatigue, etc.. 

* One very important thing I have realized is that Kratom significantly worsened my pre existing mental health issues . At first I thought it was helping me, but in reality I was just high. Once I developed a tolerance and Kratom stopped working, my anxiety, depression, and other mental issues started to gradually become worst. By the end of my Kratom use I was a mess and in a very dark place*

For me, recovery took quite a while. I remember days 7-10 were the hardest and most uncomfortable due to the physical withdrawls such as fluctuating body temperature. 

After the physical withdrawl subsided I had heavy fatigue til about day 25 or so.

By day 30 I felt like I had made it through, but was nowhere near feeling 100%.

It took several months for me to start feeling normal again, anxiety lingered for many months and socializing post quit was challenging. I developed a stutter. Fortunately that subsided and I can communicate normally again. The irregulat heart beat also lingered for several months, but eventually subsided.

Each passing month I noted that I was feeling better than the previous one. Eventually I stopped thinking about Kratom all together. This stuff really messes with your hormones and neurottansmitters, it takes a while for those to return back to normal. As a guy I have absolutely no doubt that Kratom caused me to have low testosterone. You will regain your sense of wellbeing once your testosterone levels rebalance.


Here are some tips that I discovered ; 

Insomnia. Losing sleep was probably the most difficult side effect of quitting. For me I could usually fall asleep, but had trouble staying asleep and falling back asleep. Even when I was tired.

One supplement that works for me and I still take til this day is Magnesium Glycinate . Make sure to get the ""Pure Encapsulations"" brand though. The purity of their products is very good. I take 2-4 capsules an hour or so before bed and it helps me get a quality sleep and if I wake up prematurely it allows me to fall back asleep.

As far as trouble falling asleep, this usually only occurs when something happens in my life that upsets me. I told my psychiatrist about it and he reccomended I try Dyphenhydramine aka Benadryl.  He said that the people that created this drug did so with the intent of aiding sleep. So I gave it a try and it works. I usually buy Zzzquil and take 25mg. I noticed that if I take more than 25mg I can feel groggy the next day. But my psychiatrist said 25mg - 50mg is okay.  Also, try to use this sparingly. If you use this too often I believe it will mess with your natural ability to fall asleep. Try to limit this to no more than 2-4 times a month. The less the better.

Try to fall asleep and wake up at the same time everyday if possible, it will help. 

Nutrition wise. I encourage people to eat plenty of whole food vitamin C (200mg or more) per day. 
Oranges, strawberries, kiwi, kale, broccoli, bell peppers are all good sources.

Vitamin D is another important one, I take 5,000 iu of Vitamin D3 every morning with breakfast.

I also encourage everyone to not drink alcohol or use other drugs during the first year off Kratom.

During the first couple months I felt very fatigued and I found that drinking black tea was very helpful as a pick me up. It contains caffeine but also has theanine which prevents anxiety. 

Make sure to drink plenty of water and stay hydrated.

Try to maintain good hygeine and shave, it will help you feel better.


The most important thing is don't give up. Patience is the key to success. 

I have noticed that probably 90% of people that succesfully quit eventually start to use it again, all of them regret it. Do not make it more difficult for yourselves. Once you quit. You need to leave it in the past. There is no using it once a month, or once a week..or only during special occasions. Once you have been addicted you need to quit and move on. Life is better without this plant. I assure you. I also suggest everyone try to better themselves in some way once they quit. I enrolled in college so I could get a better career, i'm back on the right track. Kratom had me complacent in my janitorial job for years.. But now I am pursuing my dream of working in healthcare.  If you do not have a goal your energy will be wasted . You have to have a goal for your energy to be focussed. Whether it be going back to school or a new work out routine. Do something to better yourself. 

I hope you all succeed in this battle. I promise it is worth it.

For about 2 years, I would ingest about three tablespoons of K three times a day. Then last year, I went down to about three teaspoons 3 times a day. 
Sometime between October of last year and right now, I gradually lost all sexual abilities and this is absolutely my reason to quit. I went to a men's health clinic and they told me that my T levels are greatly depleted which scared the fuck out of me. 
Kratom is without a doubt the culprit and I'm so ready to get off this shit. This week, I've been able to go down to three teaspoons twice a day, one dose in am and one before bed. I feel like I'm making progress but I can feel my body craving my old doses. 
If K wasn't making me totally impotent, I wouldn't even stress getting off it but it is. 
I know that it doesn't do that to everyone but I talked to quite a few people who are having this issue.

This thread is the only thing keeping me going on this point. Well that, and music. But ya so I'm on day 4 right now, my symptoms have been absolutely terrible thus far, and don't seem to be letting up. I was probably up to like 25-30 gpd before I jumped. Which I know I probably should have tapered, I should mention that I have taken maybe half a gram at the worst parts of this experience just to make it slightly less worse. But that (taking half a g) is only once in a 24 hr period. Either way it's not enough at all to null the withdrawal side effects, just a slight amount to lessen the thrashing blows I was receiving prior to taking.

&#x200B;

Anyway, my question is... How much longer should I expect the worst of the physical to last? Also, how long if taking half a gram (from a 30 gpd habit) going to prolong these intense side effects? If you guys feel taking half a gram is significant enough to just push this on and on and on, then obviously I will stop. But my idea in taking it has been, it's only when the symptoms are completely unbearable (once a day max), it's also not enough in any way to stop the brutal beating I'm receiving from these physical with drawls, so at the very least my body will land on a half a gram a day habit which I imagine I should be able to get off with little discomfort. Thoughts? Please any advice would be very helpful right now, I just want to get the worst of it over as fast as possible at this point.",3

Day 1 and Day 2 were pretty bad but honestly manageable, the entire time being on kratom, i hyped up in my head of having this terrible,crippling withdrawal but when it came down to it ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt shit.
So anyone out there who is trying to quit, hear me out when i say; it eventually ends. because i was scared to death to quit and when i did, it wasn‚Äôt shit.


Anyways this week has been amazing, I‚Äôve been playing Legend of Zelda for four days straight and I just beat Wind Waker.
In my opinion they are wonderful games in general but during withdrawal they hit even harder.
They have you covered in all departments of emotion with wonderful characters, the music (best part of legend of zelda games) and art style/world building.
I‚Äôve been getting chills non stop playing wind waker and I‚Äôm now playing twilight princess but if you are into gaming, i really recommend you give these games a try.
If it weren‚Äôt for these games keeping my mind occupied, the withdrawal would‚Äôve been way worse.


I have a wii u but the screen is messed up so i‚Äôm emulating these games through ‚ÄòCEMU‚Äô. it‚Äôs a near flawless wii u emulator, so if you have a decent gaming PC, you can easily run these games at 30 fps 1080p in less than an hour

Never had withdrawals like this. My heart is going a mile a minute and I'm dizzy and just overall miserable. I've never had wd's to where I'm actually scared of something happening. I just recently found out the extracts I have been taking are Kratom extract mixed with another chemical that starts with the letter T. I'm not going to print say it because I don't want anyone looking it up. I wish nobody told me. Ever. If you know what I'm talking about, I am so so sorry. Worst thing to ever happen to me.

 I started taking Kratom to get off Withdrawals from this stuff and Kratom couldn't even compete until about a week and a half would go by of me wd'ing and feeling every second of time go buy. Finally the lesson started working and that started my Kratom addiction that has me in shambles today.

I'm so miserable right now and I've slept 1 hour in 2 days. I look like the walking dead and feel like it too. 

Well the addict in me couldn't take it because these wd's are so terrible so I looked around my house for Kratom I forgot about. I searched high and low. Found half of a kilo of powder in my car and I brought it inside. I stared at it knowing it could ease even just a little bit of Pain. I left the room and got on here to let you guys I'm struggling. Bad. I know it's only been 32 hours and while they were dreadfull, I'm not even at the worst part and don't even know if I can handle it. 

Talking about this is calming me down which is why it's so long, because I'm emotional and feel like crying. I used to never cry about anything. I cried 6 years ago and haven't cried since. I don't say that because I'm tough (I'm obviously not sitting here shaking) but I think I finally realized it was the k and drugs that were making me that way. 

Anyway, these wd's are worse than I've ever had and I'm debating on just taking the k till the wd's from the other stuff wear off, and then getting help in the form of gabapentin and something for my Tachycardia so I can do this manageably.",9

This community has helped make me stop rationalizing the reasons for taking kratom and downplay the risks. I'm tired of revolving my days, my life around dosing. I've told myself it's helping for so long, but really it's just helped me stay numb. I'm tired of guessing if my health issues are related to kratom or if it's something else. I don't want to live like this anymore. I'm ready to live a life where kratom isn't at the center. 

What helped you quit kratom? Were there any methods or supplements that helped make it easier or helped you stay away from kratom? Feel free to share you experiences and insight. 

Thank you to everyone who shares here. I don't think I'd be ready to do this if I had not joined this community and see all of your experiences appear in my thread everyday.",18

Second time coming off, but this time much lower dose. Symptoms are awful - insomnia, panic/anxiety, depression, anhedonia, total exhaustion. I'm relatively sure it's kratom withdrawal, but I also have this lingering suspicion that it could be benzo withdrawal (either in combination or on its own). I've been prescribed benzos for years (I'm prescribed 15 mg Valium per day, but I usually only take between 10 and 12, as I'm slowly tapering). Dose of kratom (this time) was only like max 12 gpd, every day for 5 months, tapered down to 4 gpd before jumping. My shitty feeling does more or less correspond with the kratom reduction and cessation, but the benzo taper hasn't been perfectly linear either. Now I'm starting to freak myself out - what if the kratom was simply masking what is actually benzo withdrawal? The reason this freaks me out is because if it's benzo, I'm in for a wayyyy longer haul than kratom. Any ideas?",2

I normally don‚Äôt post but I want to check in and maybe motivate myself to really get off the stuff now. I‚Äôm an accountant and I need all my brain cells. Kratom affects my memory really bad. To the point where I can‚Äôt even look away from a spreadsheet for two seconds and look back and remember what I was freaking doing. It‚Äôs pissing me off at this point.   Kratom also killed my libido completely. Constipation. Anxiety. And I‚Äôm convinced that it causes muscle wasting and bone degeneration, but I have no evidence to back those claims, except a broken hip and a broken knee and subsequent knee replacement from falling down a flight of 2 steps. Also much weaker than I was five years ago before I picked this dirty little habit up.  

Anyway, I‚Äôll get to the point. I‚Äôm just shocked that I feel this terrible and I still had about 17 g today, maybe even more. I had about 7 g in the morning and then like two doses of 5 I believe.  Maybe 6, so could be even 19 total.   Does anybody have any advice? How long does this crappy feeling last? I know that the acute withdrawal lasts about three or four days because I went through it before. Terrible anxiety.  I was over most of it, but the PAWS kicked in and I still felt crappy after over a month, so I went back.",5

7+ years of opiate addiction that created a huge set of problems in my life. Originally my husband and I were taking pills together but at the beginning of 2017, we decided to stop. That was the worst year of my life. I filed bankruptcy (bc a massive pill habit will do that to you), stopped speaking to my toxic biological father, and lost my relationship with my 3 siblings as a result. Then my first fur baby passed away...I don't have kids so my pets are my everything. I was beyond devastated. At this point, I had my first relapse and went back to pills. I kept this a secret from my husband who never had a single relapse. 
Now was a period of about 3 years where I would hide it, get caught, get clean for a few months and repeat. A bunch of times...an embarrassing amount of times really.  And eventually, about this time last year, I got caught again and stopped. This was bc I found a new, safe and legal plant called Kratom. My usage was 4 0.5 teaspoons every 3 hours. Every single day. And I hated it. Tasted disgusting, got stuck in my throat so many times that I'd have to throw it back up, etc. 
I liked pills bc they were pretty easy to hide. This awful nonsense was not as easy to hide. I was so ashamed that I had gotten myself hooked on something else, even if it wasn't pills. It robbed me of that victory. I hit my bottom when I abused a headache medicine I was prescribed that had codeine in it. I took way too much, along with all my regular kratom. What I didn't know was that the pharmacy had filled the script with a slightly different med, one that had a barbiturate instead of acetaminophen. I don't remember most of that night, but I do remember falling off a step ladder in the kitchen and cracking my head a few times on the way down. I remember slurring and falling a lot. It was one of worst nights ever. I was so embarrassed and my husband had no idea what was wrong with me bc I hid that med from him too. He went thru my stuff, found the bottle, and we had a long talk the next day. I came clean about my excessive kratom usage, and made the decision to stop. An experience like that on a drug that you don't even like (the barbiturate, just not my thing) along with hating yourself for getting hooked on another opiate like substance made me realize how bad my addictive nature really was.
So here I am now, ready to be sober for the first time in a decade. During all of this, I was on and off anti depressants and weight loss medication (the one that is basically speed). I realized that this problem was leaking into all aspects of my life and that I couldn't separate drugs prescribed by a Dr vs all others. I am horrified at the liar and POS my addiction turned me into. But I'm also grateful to be at this place now. I think I am finally ready to do the hard work and figure out all the underlying pieces of the why. 
I've left out a ton of info but I'm happy to answer any questions! I thank you all in advance for any support given; I've never tried a program or really pushed myself in recovery before. I like the energy of this sub, so I'm very happy to be an official part of it now. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",31

There was a day that I felt like I was high and disconnected from reality but I was completely sober. Definitely not a good experience though. 

This morning I woke up with chills and feeling completely drained. I think it‚Äôs because I ran a lot and didn‚Äôt hydrate well. Oh well lesson learned. 

I started using K recreationally and it was amazing at first but towards the end I was getting really bad anxiety and had no energy. 

I went to see my doctor because I thought my blood pressure was acting up but I think it was just my anxiety getting the best of me. My blood pressure is in the high normal range and I‚Äôve never had issues. He prescribed Metoprolol for my racing heart but I don‚Äôt like it.

It went fine except for waking up freezing cold and my body spasming. So no it didn‚Äôt go that well. At least I didn‚Äôt remember it, though. The next day I was supposed to go under light sedation to see if I needed a ureter stent put in. I thought it was weird that I was pretty aware for it. Then the burning of hellfire went through my body as they poured dye to check flow. I screamed and I heard the surgeon say ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not supposed to feel that!‚Äù And the nurse put more fentanyl and versed in me and it still hurt so bad. I KNOW the Kratom use buildup in my system interacted with the meds. Even after 2 weeks of abstinence I had interactions with anesthesia that I‚Äôve never had before, and I‚Äôve had plenty more than one surgery. 

TLDR: Kratom can interfere with anesthesia and you don‚Äôt want to feel or be awake for it. It is more traumatizing than you can imagine.",10

Always after I dose and I was only dosing 1/3 tbsp every 3 hrs down from over 1 tbsp in previous months.

My dose was way lower than it ever has been. Ben using for 5 years. Still, my body is starting to attack itself. I think because it‚Äôs an immunostimulant. Either way this hearing issue and my alopecia areata (random bald batches) both seem like autoimmune diseases. This is the first year I‚Äôve had either of these problems.

I have a time lock jar and I put my kratom in there and set it for 2 days when my hearing went out last since I had the next 2 days off. It was only 1 hr until it unlocked today and I almost convinced myself to take a scoop when it unlocked. I forced myself to add 13hrs to the timer. At this point I might as well throw it out and stop torturing myself. This shit is sneaky.

I‚Äôm ranting at this point but I can‚Äôt wait to be done with wd‚Äôs. I have no energy to do anything. I feel like I‚Äôm Wasting my days because I can get up without feeling exhausted. I‚Äôm sweating and freezing. I have work tomorrow and I‚Äôm worried. I can‚Äôt even think of things to do beside looking at my phone. I feel so useless.

Let me start. am a 27 years old guy who unfortunately like to try drugs and how it interact with your moods/feelings/perspective am always been curious about different medical drugs and am no stranger to withdrawals. So beginning of last year i started to take Kratom when we started working from home. it was god sent. i really liked the mood uplifting. until 1 week ago. Just to share i take 15\~24g a day everyday. so a week ago i wake up to take my usual dose with coffee but behold am out of kratom...Oh well. lets say it was unexpected. so first 2 days was the worse and by worse i would say mild withdrawals but then again everyone is different.  i had pain in every muscle. shitting all the time. my eyes keep watering. coughing. shortness of breath. flu like symptoms and can't eat. always throw-up list goes on.. by 3rd day i remember i had Modafinil so i just took it for the energy since i was at this point a plastic bag lol. oh well. so it helped for a while because it made me get distracted from all the withdrawals for a while. of course sleepless nights and was lucky to go into resident evil village. which helped taking my mind off and by 5th day am good until now by good i mean its not as bad and its almost normal but you can feel you still have slight withdrawals. like depressed. sweating. So few advices that worked.

1. always keep your AC on
2. Take NAC and Magnesium
3. Take shower and Panadol for pain
4. Drink alooot and i mean aloooooot of water
5. keep yourself distracted. just do what you like even though that time it's not really enjoyable. As long as time pass you are winning.

Also a bit of advice. Taper before quitting. but yeah it wasn't too terrible. YOU CAN DO IT.  i hope this post motivate you to keep going every hour.  


EDIT: Forgot to add. sometime when it get really hard. i take 3 deep breathes and close my eye and say its all normal am just experiencing the transition back to normal its just temporary. i use this all the time not just for kratom. but believe me. it always worked!",12

1) Feeling mostly decent now, finally can sleep alright and have been sleeping extra late lately, my body I'm sure is in a major amount of sleep debt.

2) Mood is MOSTLY decent but I'm in the middle of petitioning for a divorce. We've already been separated for 9 months but I'd lie if I said this doesn't sting a bit. But she did some awful stuff to me so remembering that helps me keep a relatively cool head about things.

3) Premature Ejaculation is mostly resolved now. Man it was BAD for a while, like could hardly make any contact without almost finishing lol. Now I can go much longer and perform well so I'm happy on that end.

4) Unlike other quits, I absolutely CANNOT do alcohol in any quantity. The mood disturbances from alcohol are over now but good God ANY quantity causes the most intense RLS. Last night I had 4 beers (def too many) and still to this moment my body feels like it's being electrocuted.

5) DLPA is absolutely legit and I can't believe I forgot it for most of my quit. Started a couple days ago and feel a massive difference already.

6) LDN on a microgram scale absolutely REKT me. Holy fuk never again. That was so so unpleasant (Tried this on day 21 IIRC)

7) I leave the country on the 2nd so I need to get my mind and body as close to 100% as I can. Got a lot of good things planned in the next few months so I want to enjoy it to the fullest and now still be suffering.

Goals: Get the anxiety back down to baseline (not that far off tbh), get the RLS squared away and my mood a little more stabilized. Once I get back, get my debt completely eliminated and get this stress off my back. Also boost my programming skills so I can start working full time as a full stack developer. Once I get this stuff back in order I'll be in a much much happier place in life üòé

Worst mistake of my life. Started smoking cigarettes heavily. Had a 15-20g a day habit for over 6 months.

Don‚Äôt ask me why I went back, I don‚Äôt know how I survived that hellish withdrawal period and decided to relapse, but I did in mid January. I fooled myself into thinking I could just take some every now and then and not get addicted again. But I just kept going back for more. This time I was taking 2g twice a day and kept it very consistent so that I wasn‚Äôt spending ridiculous amounts of money, but the problem is that I was hiding the fact that I relapsed from my partner. I didn‚Äôt lie to her about it, I just didn‚Äôt tell her I was taking it again, which is just as bad. For 4 months she never noticed but 1 week ago she found an empty package of capsules in the recycling bin. When she asked me if it was an old package that I just found and threw out, I came clean and told her I have been taking small amounts since January, and she lost it. Tbh I deserved all of the foul words she threw my way, and even now she continues to be patient with me. I‚Äôm in disbelief that someone has put up with my shit the way she has. We are financially stable, we have a beautiful, healthy 1 year old boy, we both work our asses off, but I am an addict and I have let my vices consume me for far too long. In one week I did a rapid taper, finished my last capsule last night, and I‚Äôm done with this shit. I‚Äôm ready for the sleepless nights, the restless legs, whatever I have to do to get through this. I deserve all of it, but I swear this will be the last time I touch this shit. It has ruined my sense of integrity, my emotional balance, and is now degrading my relationship. I won‚Äôt let it happen. Let day 1 commence. To anyone struggling with addiction, I understand you, I am here for you. Don‚Äôt ever let anyone make you feel  less than just for being an addict. You are human and you are important.

Then, I won't have my built in excuse ""well I would have been great, but Kratom..."" I'm afraid to grapple with the idea that I failed because I wasn't good enough","Hello,

Opioid doc here. Sorry I've been away and I didn't respond to literally any of your comments... 

I'm doing pretty well off Kratom, but thinking back to why was so hard to get off in the first place? And it's still an issue I'm dealing with, because while I might not be drinking green sludge, I'm downing multiple monster energy drinks and cups of coffee per day, can't sleep at night, and basically only feel good when I have a hit of chemically induced energy. 

So If I really delve down and become super honest withmyself one of the reasons I'm doing this and in the past did other substances is because it provides a built in excuse if I fail at something. Basically every negative thing in my life gets excused due to addiction.  For example.

If it wasn't for alcohol I would be making twice as much money right now and could afford to have children, but instead I'm stuck in this job where I'm grossly underpaid, but I can't get out of it until I publish more, but I can't write well because I'm high all the time.....so it's ok that I'm here

If it wasn't for Kratom I wouldn't be this overweight,  I stopped going to the gym because Kratom took the pleasure away from that, becuase I was always tapering and going into withdrawal if I worked out too hard and so If it wasn't for Kratom I would be super fit right now and I just know that I will get in shape one day.

Well because of the caffeine, I don't sleep as well, so I have to take the sleep when I can get it so If I roll out of bed at 8:30am to get to work at 9 then thats ok, because I must have needed the sleep, once I quit caffeine I'm sure I will be waking up at 5:30am and getting my day started right, but as of right now I just dont' have the time.

I'm starting to think maybe I'm just a shit person, and these excuses have nothing to do with my stagnation and failure in many areas of my life.",17

However, I must get back to life now and lying-in bed feeling bad won't keep me paying rent. I have the worst brain fog I have felt in my entire life. I mean, sure i can scroll on my phone, but as soon as I sit down at my computer to try playing a video game or do work, i just sit there, minutes going by before realizing.  


Do you have any tips for the brain fog? I try going on walks to keep active, drinking a lot of fluids, some power aid etc to get hydrated. I try to get at least two meals a day, but I cannot tell you food is very appealing to me. I take magnesium bisglycinate at night, and i take valerian root as needed for anxiety/ sleep.   


Are there any good supps for the brain fog part? I can handle a lil bit of anxiety, but the brain frog leaves me feeling like shit for not being able to enjoy anything.",9

Or were you feeling sort of back to normal? My other question is, I plan on taking some other supplements to help as well. I have black seed oil, vitamin C, magnesium glycinate, passionflower extract and valerian for sleep, agmatine sulfate, Sam-E, 5HTP, L-theanine and holy Basil. Do any of those things not mix well with Gabapentin? I‚Äôve been down this road before but didn‚Äôt have the Gaba so I‚Äôm just wanting to get this stuff out of my system for the last time.

I was at 20+ gpd for months before realizing I needed to stop. Getting off of it was a bitch, to say the least.

I have an addictive personality. I've completely abstained from alcohol, marijuana, etc because of my tendency to use too much for my own good. 

Now that I'm off kratom I can see my tendency to want to go back to it. Even after all the grief it caused me. 

If you're wondering if this stuff is serious, my opinion is, yes it is. It may not make you nod off or stop your heart, but it will change your life if abused (at least from what I've experienced and seen others talk about), and it will most likely be hard to get off if.",35
2021-05-12 20:36:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nb40jx/no_choice_but_to_quit_ct/,No Choice but to quit CT,"Ok guys. I've been lurking this sub for about a year now because I've wanted to quit for so long but finally have the courage to quit (because I need to).

Well, where do I begin. I apologize in advance for the novel I'm about to write. I've just literally told not a soul about my addiction that's been going on for around 6 years and this addiction has taken everything from me. This is me coming clean. My diary entry if you will.

Started in highschool taking opioids. I loved the feeling more than anything. I was functioning in day to day life better than ever before. I knew the risk but didn't go overboard. I'd take them for a week at a time, the stop. Mildly wd for a couple days in the form of no temp control, body aches, and loss of sleep. Those would subside in a day or 2 and want a big deal. Well the person I got them from ran out so I was googling legal things that feel like opioids. Found Kratom. I tried a couple of cheap leaf brands from a headshop but never felt anything off of it so I stopped. Then did more googling and found Tianeptine. I tried that and completely feel off the deep end. It felt just like opioids and I started spending ALL my money on it. One time a shipment was late and I didn't have any for 3 days. Worst 3 days of my life. I would be shivering while profusely sweating, I was HIGHLY irritable and anything and everything would make me snap, I didn't sleep for more than 3 hours total in those 3 days yet was incredibly exhausted all the time. Finally I got my shipment and the addict in me would do anything to make it stop, so I kept re dosing. Luckily this scared me too death and I swore I'd never touch the stuff again so I did some research and found people talking about Kratom for Tia WD. Decided I'd do anything to make the wd stop so I bought a good brand of Kratom and it took off the edge soooo much. It was still miserable but manageable. After that I swore up and down Kratom was a miracle. As most of us have told ourselves before, it's just a plant and it's legal so there's nothing to worry about. Well it has destroyed my life. I started taking more and more Kratom just to feel it each time. 

I started on powder and at my peak for powder I was at 45 gpd. That got obnoxious and disgusting taking that many caps or that much powder per day. I then found OPMS gold caps. At my peak for that I was at 9 gold caps a day. 

Aside from me spending all my money from every single paycheck, it destroyed my relationship. I dated this girl for 4 years and the first 2 years were as perfect as a relationship can be. I was obsessed with her. We moved in together which is when my addiction started ruining her life as well. I made pretty good money yet was always broke and could never tell her why. I say on my butt all day everyday because I was always low on money and because in hindsight, the Kratom made me lazy and completely content with doing nothing all day every day. Once the pandemic hit I had to work from home. This is when the addiction truly ruined everything. I now had to come up with an excuse to leave the house 2 times a day every single day for 30 min at a time just to go pick some up. She would ask where I'm going and I'd always tell her ""on a drive."" She never accused me of it but if have to imagine she thought I was cheating but I could never have the courage to tell her that her boyfriend is a full blown addict. Besides, most people know nothing about Kratom so they have no idea what we are going through. I then became severely depressed all the time because I knew I needed to quit but couldn't for the life of me quit and was far too embarrassed to ask for help. I'd visit my parents on holidays and they would always be concerned because I looked sickly. I lost 35 pounds in a year (I'm already super skinny as it is) and they were very concerned. I blamed it on depression. I would always refuse to go on vacations with my family or my girlfriend because I knew I couldn't travel with and conceal this Kratom and I knew I'd go through wd on these trips. Eventually I became so depressed and lazy that I stopped reciprocating any kind of love to my girlfriend and finally she called it quits. I moved out, moved to my parents, and self reflected. At first I was made because she fell out of love with me. The more I reflected, I realized it was always me. It was the Kratom and my addiction and my inability to talk to anyone about any of my problems. 

(Again I'm so sorry I'll start wrapping this up, this is just 6 years of heartbreak and addiction and not telling a single soul all coming to the surface at once)

Again, I was taking 45 gpd of leaf, then 9 caps of OPMS gold per day, then found a headshop selling a new brand I'd never heard of. They said it was even stronger than OPMS and even cheaper. Decided to try it. Oh my god was it stronger. I'd never felt anything like it. It finally was hitting me like Kratom used to when I first started taking it. I started taking 2 caps 3 times a day, until inevitably I got to 5 caps 3 times a day which I'm at right now. I quit my job because I was depressed over the breakup, depressed about what my life had become, and how it has been like this for 6 years. It's been such a prison sentence to me, and everyone close to me. I quit my job and kept buying these capsules till I ran out of money. My parents are visiting me till tomorrow and then I'm home alone again.

I took my last dose an hour ago and have no more and no more money to buy any more with no income so this is it. I literally HAVE to be done. I intentionally stayed unemployed so that way I have no more options to slither out of this. I feel so cowardly and spineless and that I've let everyone I love down. 

If you made it this far, thank you so so so much for listening. If you didn't, I understand. If you did though, please feel free to ask me any questions or offer any solutions to help me through this. I know I work myself up so much over worrying about the wd's that I end up making it so much worse so any tips or even just saying hi would help me tremendously. 

Thank you to all who have shared their stories on here, it's already helped me more than you know. I will be updating you all on my progress even if its just so I can talk to myself.

Thanks again everyone.",25

Just wanted to share a bit of my struggle in the hopes of helping others and perhaps some encouragement. I've got myself back into quite the jam. I first had a 6 month 30-40 gpd habit in 2019-2020, completely na√Øve of any withdrawal potential. I believed all the ""oh it's just a harmless plant"" rhetoric. One day I just decided to stop, and hell descended. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and am a recovering alcoholic, so mental health issues are nothing new, but this was on a whole different level. The sheer persistence of the anxiety and panic and depression and total lack of motivation was like nothing I'd ever experienced. After about 4-5 days my wife called an ambulance because I was completely debilitated. Unfortunately for me, the ER didn't know that much about kratom, so what did they do? Put me on suboxone. Had I known then what I know now, I would have refused it and said fuck it I'll just ride this out and up my Valium for a week or two (I have been prescribed benzos for years - yes that's another huge battle to fight, but would rather focus on kratom for now). Won't go into details, but anyone that's withdrawn from suboxone will know that it is, for some at least, an even worse hell than kratom w/d. Well I eventually made it through the whole experience.   
You'd have thought I learned my lesson, but alas, an addict's mind is not logical. Late 2020 I took a bit of leftover kratom ""just to see what it would feel like"". No need to tell you how that turned out. So now I'm here 5 months later. Thankfully I was at least scared enough to never let my dose get very high, I maxed out about 10 gpd, realized what was happening, and I tapered down to about 4 gpd, then jumped a few days ago. It's been really shitty, not on the same level as a year ago, but enough to make every waking moment of my life unpleasant and anxiety-filled. I just feel a pit of nervous anxiety in my stomach constantly, to the point of tears, and am unable to find interest in anything at all. I start a new job on May 31, and it's a very good and very demanding job, and I have to be functional by then. I had also been doing this in secret, so today I told my wife everything. She was not at all happy; she doesn't have an addictive personality and sees my drug and alcohol use, both past and present, as completely self-destructive and self-loathing behavior rather than a mental illness. She basically said that if it wasn't for our daughter she would run as far away from me as possible (she's originally from the other side of the world, so if she returned there she's being quite literal). Thankfully she has calmed down now and is focused on getting me better, and so am I.I'm not a fan of supplements, but I've been trying to eat well and increase my exercise, and I meditate daily. Of course, none of this seems to help at all. I guess what I want to hear are similar stories, preferably ones that end with something like ""if I white knuckle this, I can at least be functional in a couple weeks"".  
And my advice for anyone else: if you feel yourself getting pulled in too deep, do anything you can to stop using kratom. It's certainly not likely going to kill you, but it absolutely can make your life miserable, perhaps far more miserable than you've ever experienced. Thanks all - I'm really happy this group exists.

2021-05-12 11:43:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/nars80/so_conflicted/,So Conflicted,"I'm going to be honest upfront: I am a happier person on kratom. I take 6gpd once a day in the evenings for the last 16 months. I have no desire to do any more either in frequency or amount. I have no negative effects at all, frankly. But as I started reading all of these stories I got really scared as I've never been addicted to anything, much less physically dependent. So I decided to stop for a week CT to prove to myself that it isn't going to affect me like so many others. I think you can guess where I'm going with this...  

My last dose was Saturday night and the last few days have been an eye-opener. While not as bad as most, I'm guessing, I have all the symptoms so many have described here: sweating, screwed up GI tract, insomnia, RLS, anxiety (which I've always had), heavy irritability, fatigue, the works. I really can't believe it and it is so sobering and shameful to me.  Worse, I turned a friend on to this who does have an addictive personality as a way to help him stop drinking so much (as I had read on the kratom pumping pages) and now I have to have a very difficult conversation with him.

I think that saddest of all, I thought I had zero issue with this stuff considering I don't crave more nor do I crave it more often than once a day. I did look forward to it as a way to wind down the day and it works great for that (for me).  So much so that I wrote several iterations of this in my head before realizing that what I was really doing was trying to get people to tell me it was ok to keep using it as I had been since it doesn't negatively affect my life in any way. THAT'S WHEN I KNEW. I have a dependence on this garbage. I never in a million years would have thought this possible. But here I am. So this is where I am conflicted: I know it's bad. I know I am physically and psychologically dependent on this junk but at the same time, it has only been a positive thing for me. This last year has sucked so much less for me than it otherwise would have, but I also cannot reconcile having an addiction. Not me. The idea of being dependent on anything, whether a person or a substance, disgusts me to my core. So I have to quit it. Not because it is ruining my life, but because I can't be dependent on something. 

So, actually, I'm not really conflicted at all. I need to stop. I think I just needed to write this (mostly to myself) as I know quitting holds no real positives for me outside of not being dependent on something  but that alone is more than enough reason for me. I'll be throwing out the remainder of what I have and not using it again. Someone posted how they used it as fertilizer so that is what I am going to do.  Actually, I just did it. All gone.

This is probably the tenth time i've done this shit. the last 3 or 4 times being around the same dose I was at this last time. 

I'm familiar enough with this process that I kind of know what to expect at each step of the way. I typically look forward to 100 hours as when the worst of the physical acutes will be on their way out. I hit 4 24 hour periods last night at 5pm so 9pm was 100 hours. 

I tried to quit back in january and made it a week before I ended up buying some and rationalizing that I was just going to use a little to lessen the lingering physical wds and then went pretty much right back to where I was. 

This quit has felt very different, i've felt a bit more determined than last time (partially probably because I leave for my summer job on a commercial fishing boat in a month so i HAVE to be clean and reasonably back to normal by then)

The plan I had set for myself was to make it through 48-96 hours of CT and then start taking really low dose stem and vein and taper that for a week or two. I typically use benzos for the RLS during the worst of the acutes (I know that's playing with fire but i get the RLS super bad and I really dont like benzos, also I can barely get them so I only have enough for a few days)

Now that i'm on day 5, which is when i typically expect physicals to be letting up, I'm on the fence if I should try my stem and vein plan still or just keep rolling CT. I feel like If i do the stem and vein taper right it could make the next couple of weeks much less shitty, but I could also blow it and backtrack and I would have no more benzos for RLS.

Anyone have any experience with this way of doing things?

P.S. I also have some agmatine sulfate that I used to take with my kratom sometimes. anyone have any experience with that doing anything to alleviate wd's?",2

I do feel like I suffered a lot of PAWS during these last four months that was different than my baseline depression. For context, I also had a heavy addiction to opiates ten years ago and have had unhealthy drinking patterns since (gave up alcohol 5 months ago) so am an addict.

DLPA supplements have been so life changing for me that I'm actually getting a little worried that it's addictive or preventing full recovery as I guess it prevents breakdown of endorphins which increases the levels in your body as well as provides the building blocks for dopamine. I am worried that I feel too good....?

I'm also doing a great deal of therapy, meditation, wim hof breath work, etc. so it's hard to say it's just the DLPA, but what a huge difference it seemed to make instantly.

I feel great and like myself again all of a sudden and I'm glad I found this supplement but do you guys think it is safe and not preventing my full recovery? All info I can find is that it totally is and is recommended on a lot of addiction recovery sites as it's just amino acids....",5

I didn‚Äôt fully understand their suffering, and now that I do, I‚Äôm overflowed with heartbreak knowing what that suffering feels like and how many people go through this every day. I started taking kratom for social anxiety, thinking it was a benign plant medicine. I don‚Äôt know what happened, but now I‚Äôve woken up to a nightmare of a life.

Some a little after I wake up and some more at night. I also stagger my doses about 2 or 3 times for each session. I can already tell this shit has began to turn on me. About two months ago I had a very impacted left ear tht was messed up close to 5 weeks. During that time I started to get random dizzy spells. I know that messed up ear canals can cause this but, problem is my left ear has been fine for the last few weeks but I still have these times that I feel my body just suddenly wants to collapse. Its a really weird feeling.

Funny thing is, I think it really only happens when I start to withdraw from this shit. And lately I have developed random chest pains, and within the last few days when I have tried to fall asleep I will notice my left arm starts to feel like its aching and burning. The chest pains are not that severe when they happen, but still worry me. I feel a lot of it may be likely anxiety, probably brought on by this sludge ,because when I take it everything goes away for a bit. Ive taken my blood pressure a few times with a machine we have at home and everytime I get normal readings.

Just wondering if kratom has caused any of these symptoms for anyone else. I know this post is long and probably dumb but quite honestly, I am starting to get worried. But I am now so damn addicted to this shit now. Biggest mistake I ever made was letting my friend talk me into to trying nthis stuff a year ago. Last couple of days, I have started to lower my doses. Eventually, I want to make the jump and just be ready to quit. The thing tht sucks, is obviously withdraw but for me, I hate the fucking heat my body produces while withdrawing and especially the dull boring depression. And especially trying to sleep while withdrawing. Hell, I can get drunk and not 2 hours later, the withdraw wakes me up with crawling legs

What kind of surprises me is, compared to a lot of posts I have read here, I am actually at a much lower gpd amount than a lot of people. But, I guess tht is because everyone nis different. Thanks to anyone who reads this wall of text",5

I‚Äôm feeling pretty good physically and attempting to stay busy and productive, but the magnitude of the decision I‚Äôm making has been hitting me in waves.

I do feel some pride and excitement at this thought, but at the same time, I can‚Äôt help but be reminded of the complete panic that would overtake me when I became aware of my tianeptine stash running out. I‚Äôve made plans to take a walk at the park tomorrow, spend some time with my family, and clean my room, which I‚Äôm hoping will help keep my mind off of what I‚Äôm about to go through. I am hopeful that these WDs won‚Äôt be as severe as the ones from tianeptine. In February, I made a half-hearted attempt to quit, spurred on by the delay of my kratom delivery as a result of the severe winter weather that much of the country was experiencing at that time. I made it about 18 hours with almost no apparent WD symptoms. With tianeptine, my pupils would be fully dilated and I would be covered with goosebumps if I went just 8 hours without it. I think that my ability to stay active and spend as much time outside as possible will make or break me in this. I need to keep reminding myself that absolutely NOTHING is as important in my life right now than quitting kratom. If any of you have any suggestions for creative ways to stay busy during this it would be greatly appreciated. Almost forgot to mention that I have naltrexone on the way which I am planning to start once the acutes have subsided.

The worst for me is the insomnia, which is getting better; worst was night 3. I kicked it about 10 months ago and let the evil voice of addiction trick me into thinking I could handle it again; don't listen to that voice. This quit hasn't been as bad. Some anxiety and weird temperature/ sweating but by far the worst has been the rls/insomnia. 

Stop now. Take care of your self. Drink water. Excersise as much as you can manage. Use the pain and discomfort as a reflection tool. 

I decided to try staying at work through it and I think keeping your mind busy helps. The worst times are when I have nothing to do.

A few of tools to make the rls/insomnia less irritating, I have found, thc delta8, melatonin, WATER, magnesium, vitamin C, excersize, and deep breathing when it strikes. 

Dealing with the discomfort this time has been easier because I let it become a new normal. Almost like lowering my expectations. You will hit a low, and soon remember what the REAL normal was. It is wonderful, reality start to become more vibrant. Music is an excellent tool for dopamine release, if you are so inclined, use it.

Last but not least, your wallet is a little fatter.

Safe travels, my friends. Hope this helps someone, maybe even me!

I‚Äôve been on kratom for about 2 years, at its worst about 30 gpd. Over the past couple weeks I had successfully tapered down to about 14 grams, sometimes slipping up and taking a little bit more. Was feeling super excited, and confident in my ability to take it all the way down to zero by the end of June.. and then yesterday after work I fractured my leg in 3 places and dislocated my foot... absolutely excruciating pain, even after being shot up with fentanyl every 2 hours at the hospital. I‚Äôm finally back home with a prescription of oxy, and haven‚Äôt taken any kratom in over 24 hours.. I‚Äôm under the impression that I‚Äôm not experiencing any withdraws because of all the real opiates that I‚Äôve been given, but am wondering what the hell is going to happen once I don‚Äôt need those... am I suppressing the kratom withdraw until later on & setting myself up for a rougher withdraw by adding in the oxy? Is it safe to be replacing kratom with another opiate after extensive heavy use? Anybody have a similar experience? I apologize if I didn‚Äôt state my concerns very clearly, I am most definitely under the influence of all the medicine that was pumped into me at the hospital, I am just wondering what the hell is going to happen in my body with all of this going on??? As of right now I have no intention of continuing kratom use as I have no idea if that is even safe with these medications. They also have me on gabapentin for nerve pain, which I know absolutely nothing about. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! 

I love you all, and do not think I‚Äôd have managed to get that far in my taper without seeing everything that you all share here on this sub daily.",2

2021-05-11 18:14:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/na9aa2/day_35_no_kratomthis_is_a_mental_aspect_post/,Day 35 no kratom/this is a mental aspect post,"Leaps and bounds. That's what I describe the difference between last week and this week as. I know I haven't posted in a while, but work has been crazy busy nonstop lately, and I am wiped out by the end of the day (still bike riding like crazy every day, I can NOT stress how much exercise helps anxiety, it's insane)

First off, I feel pretty fantastic most of the time now. Let's get that out of the way. Like better than I have at all on kratom in the last year or so. I still have panic attacks at night, but they are way less intense, and only when I am trying to fall asleep. 20 minutes later, boom I'm asleep. I'm convinced at this point I am only panicking at night because I have for the last 4 months and my brain goes right to that place when I get up to bed.

I started thinking about the mental battle with anxiety and panic attacks regarding kratom withdrawals, after all everyone on here says quitting kratom is 90% mental. I thought it can't be as simple as just not taking kratom and waiting it out, I must have a huge mental battle ahead of me, after all, I don't get anxiety and panic attacks and whatnot when I'm distracted like at work. So I must be going into a panic attack of my own volition (unwillingly), and I need to figure out why the hell I'm doing this to myself.

 At first, I was panicking during the taper because I didn't know if I was dropping the doses too fast, or too slow, or taking the wrong strain. Input the ease for an individual to believe any of those and use that as a reason to not stick to the taper. Then it's a slippery slope right back to your highest dose amounts. STICK TO THE DAMN TAPER. It's gonna suck, believe me I know, but stick to it.  Then I was panicking close to my quit date because I thought it would get way worse by quitting 6 doses a day even though they were small. Then I quit and was totally fine. After a week, I started feeling a lot worse anxiety-wise.

 I got it in my head that maybe I'm freaking myself out, and I'm not going through anxiety from withdrawals, just giving myself anxiety from thinking I'm going to have anxiety. Then I got really discouraged because that's way harder to beat than just waiting out kratom withdrawal time periods. So I started devising mental triggers, whenever I feel anxiety coming on, I would immediately think about one image in my head or topic, and build my thoughts around that instead of how terrible anxiety feels. (If that doesn't work, we can always resort to Wim-Hoff, that shit never fails)

But the problem is, when you have anxiety, every single twitch and weird feeling you get in your body and even thoughts triggers more anxiety. It's like you're paying too much attention to every little detail, and assuming the worst about every single one of them, and that makes the mental battle worse, and way way harder. That's why I think ""PAWS"" (that's what I'm blaming it on) takes so long. It's almost as if we have to go through every twitch and tremor without the drug and realize we're fine. That way whenever we have these little mental triggers, we have the memory of going through it before, completely off of kratom, and made it through okay and it really had not much to do with the drug. In this way, eventually over time we pay less and less attention to them and can start focusing on the life we are trying to cultivate without kratom. I call that ""healing the brain"" and ""the brain learning how to live without being numbed"" and my doctor agrees, this is what takes time. 

Fast forward to a few days ago, a VAST improvement in anxiety. Turns out I was wrong, there is a statute of limitations on anxiety for kratom withdrawals, and I feel I am finally past it (THANKFULLY). But I am happy still to have developed the habits of steering my thoughts away from how terrible I feel, I really think that's a useful tool I can use for the rest of my life.

For those of you struggling with the mental aspect of all these insane kratom withdrawals, just remember your mental battle is going to be hard (shit, I mean your physical battle is crazy hard, what do you expect), but I am here to say although every day gets better and better gradually, there is one day for everyone where the ""better"" jumps up a huge amount without you expecting it. I am probably 90% back to my old self most of the time, and I don't miss kratom one fucking bit.

Stay strong everyone! And thank you all for the support!",11

I currently been on kratom since 2016, and have been a daily user since 2018, and am currently at the absurd dose of 3 oz a day just to feel normal and level headed. I've tried multiple times to do the taper and the cold turkey, neither been successful. I work full time and am a full time engineering student and simply don't have time to detox with such a busy schedule. I decided to give this outpatient program a try, and they are recommending putting me on suboxone. I understand suboxone is also addictive and can cause withdrawals as a well, but I feel like I can more effectively taper off of it if my doses are administered by a professional. This outpatient program also offers support groups and counseling. What are your thoughts on this? Should I go through with the suboxone on this out patient program? If not why?",3

I was taking Kratom on and off for years just for fun, and never had any issue stopping or choosing not to take it. However, since the beginning of 2020 I was taking it regularly. I always thought there were no negative side effects or withdrawal symptoms. 3 days ago I ran out of Kratom and thought I would take a little tolerance break. Well little did I know I would suffer so badly I thought I had covid! I have body chills, RLS, insomnia, feeling anxious and detached. 

The physical symptoms I can power through, however I‚Äôve been reading a lot on this thread (which I‚Äôve JUST been introduced to) and I‚Äôm worried for the psychological symptoms. I‚Äôve already ordered more Kratom and it‚Äôll be here tomorrow. 

Please let me know your thoughts if I begin to taper once I get my Kratom in.... or since I‚Äôll already be at day 4 to just continue cold Turkey? I‚Äôd estimate I was taking 6-14gd. I‚Äôm very confident that I will successfully be able to taper, but is it pointless at this point? I was thinking I‚Äôd take 4gpd and taper from there.

Any advice and insight will be so appreciated. I‚Äôm pretty scared and ashamed and don‚Äôt del like I can share this with anyone in my life.

Withdrawals were insane. Insomnia for two weeks, wildly fluctuating body temps (chills and sweating) coupled with the worst anxiety I‚Äôve ever experienced in my life.

Anywho, I trudged through the withdrawals  only to develop massive cravings for alcohol that I struggled to fight off.

The only time my brain felt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù or relief was when I was rapidly pounding shots of straight whiskey and causing my BAC to surge rapidly. Once I took that first sip of whiskey it was like turning on a faucet that even the best plumber in the world couldn‚Äôt shut off. I would drink in rapid succession for about 2 hours and then be done. I would do this 3 times a week roughly. 

It didn‚Äôt affect my work life strangely enough but it did cause strain in my relationships. Mainly with my girlfriend of 5 years.

Because of these uncontrollable urges for alcohol, I started to use kratom whenever I felt the urge to drink. And boy did it work. 
Not only did the desire to drink go away it‚Äôs as if kratom developed an aversion to alcohol. It sounded gross and was the last thing I wanted to do. 

I now want to quit again. And know, that although the withdrawals really, really, really suck, I know I can grit through it. 

I‚Äôm just terrified that my cravings for alcohol will return with a similar vengeance as last time I quit.

I made it to almost 1 month clean, after using up to 20gpd for 11 months. I won't get into details of what wd I had, we all know it wasn't pretty or enjoyable. However, the most prominent component for me always was, and still is, anxiety and panic. And unlike other wd symptoms, it got significantly worse in the past 2 weeks. In the past week it got so bad, I was panicking constantly during the day and could not get any sleep at night due to nocturnal panic attacks. I tried everything I cod get my hands on, including hydroxidine, melatonin, and bensoz. Benzos were the only thing that helped, but obviously I don't want to use them often. So far only used twice in 2 weeks and hoping to either not use anymore or keep the usage at about that level. Benzos are an emergency medication for crisis situations, not the go-to pill for anxiety.

Anyway, back to the point. After getting virtually no sleep for 2 nights, yesterday I was a complete mess. I didn't know what to do, so I went to the ER to see if they can help me. SO GLAD I DID!!! They hooked me up with a psychiatrist via a telehealth appointment. That 1-something hour conversation with her was life changing. We discussed many many issues, including my past krarom use (she didn't think it was a big deal especially already almost a month out). Long story short, she recommended that I try propanolol for physical manifestations of anxiety: pounding heart, palps, knot in the stomach, sweating etc. Today, just about 2 hours ago, I took the first dose. I was skeptical at first but OMG. Let me tell you, the effect is dramatic. It is similar to Xanax but without the sedation. I no longer feel my pounding heart, my head is clear, the knot in my stomach has almost disappeared. My hr was exceeding 90 just sitting around before I took it, and now is at a comfortable 65. I feel alive again, like 1000 pounds have been lifted off my shoulders. I only took 10mg but I was ok to go up to 20 if I wanted to, and I feel that the benefit at 20 will be even more. I totally see using it before bed together with a sleeping pill (the psych also gave me mirtazapine) and for the first time in forever, im optimistic about the results. Im very very anxious about sleep now but we will see. 

So just wanted to let you guys know. This medicine is harmless, cheap, and is totally worth a try!!! Cheers!",14

Today I'm nearing end of day 1,"It seems every time I quit, even if it's only for a few days, I drastically increase my usage. This came to a head on Saturday and it was the wake up call I needed. There have been plenty of times I thought I was at bottom, but oh boy. Saturday was bottom. 

I went to redose in the afternoon and felt a bit nauseous. I quickly ate half a bagel as to not throw up the $40 I just choked down. About 30 minutes later, nausea is back. I start making a sandwich and make peace with the fact it'll kill my buzz but I'm feeling like shit. Before I can finish making it I feel so dizzy. I lay down and everything is spinning, my lips are numb. I'm trying to take deep breaths and I'm freezing. When I sit up and try to stand I almost fall. I'm uncontrollably shaking to the point I can't walk. Tell husband to take me to the ER because I'm fighting to stay awake.

On the way I tell him everything, because if I pass out at least he can tell the doctors what I'm on. He knew I was back on k but definitely not the extent. 

15 minutes from hospital I tell him to call 911 for an ambulance because I'm uncontrollably shaking and keep blacking out. I've heard people have seizures on k. I felt like I had to force myself to breathe and was afraid if I lost consciousness I'd stop breathing. I truly thought I was going to die. 

Turns out my blood sugar was dangerously low and I could've slipped into a seizure or coma at any second. I don't know if this is the reason for all k seizures. I regularly starve myself for this shit so it was bound to happen eventually. After IV meds to fix my blood sugar I was almost totally fine. I sobbed to the doctors, my husband, lied to my mom about why I was there. 

Sunday for whatever reason I took a very small dose and it didn't do shit, but I was too afraid to take my regular amount after what happened. 

Today, I literally drove out to my usual store to buy some k at almost 7pm because I'm feeling like such garbage. But I didn't! And I'm really fucking proud of myself. 

Day 1 has had me feeling so irritable. I feel like a shit parent. The monster is trying to tell me I'm a better mom on this shit, because Ive been so snappy today which is definitely not like me. But I'm trying to remind myself this is temporary. The next time I feel angry I seriously need to do something besides snap at whoever's around me because I feel like this isn't their problem so it's fucked up they're being affected by it. 

I definitely didn't intend for this to be so long. I'm at the store buying my son a new bath toy because my dumb ass accidentally broke it in a withdrawal induced fit of rage. But too cold to leave my car just yet. So thanks to anyone who read this far.",32

It's like I'm meeting a whole new person every day that I don't even have to socially distance with.,"Every Day It's like I am rediscovering parts of myself. It's just fabulous, especially in these sad social distancing quarantine times - it's like I'm meeting a whole new person every day that I don't even have to socially distance with.

I'm finally feeling again. This is the crazy part - I was crying yesterday when my girlfriend decided she wanted to move out for a few weeks, and I was so relieved to feel again. Yes almost happy about myself crying amidst the sad news.. I've just been so emotionally numb over the course of the past year (25-40 ish gpd). I never felt anything real apart from the urge to wash down some more of the green stuff. Ah, it did do nothing anymore of why I fell in love with it a year ago. Just nights of bad sleep, social apathy, bad moods, crazy mood swings, and a foggy mind.

Well, let me tell you! I'm 15 days into this CT, and I'm already feeling sooo much better - sometimes I catch myself laughing at my own jokes haha, totally forgot I used to be a funny guy. I'm all in for parties again, and even the occasional beer. What's best is that I memorize things much better now, and my mind doesn't feel so fogged up like it did while I was tossing and washing every few hours. It's just great and relieving to not be physically & emotionally dependent on this thing that is apparently being compared to coffee. IT'S NOT LIKE COFFEE, NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST let me tell you that.

The only really sad thing is that Kratom really messed up my 5 year long relationship (I'm 23 now), and I think I might have missed the inflection point of where it dipped into irreparable damage. That's also the reason I was crying yesterday because now I only really started feeling again, realizing how much I care about my partner, about the love we have had, and how much I want to see her happy again. And I think of all the things that I have missed out on doing over the past year, about all the stuff that I have missed out on in her life... All those things that I used to truly care about. And I cried because I do still care about these things, or better said: I care about them again and I just regret it so much of having poisoned my mind and soul for the past year.

Honestly, stop as soon as possible, that green monster will only get hungrier and hungrier, and you'll have to feed it and feed it and feed it.

For every minute, hour and day you're off it, I'm sending you a virtual pat on the back and an honest and warm hug. I know it's tough, but it's so worth it!",26

My journey from 3000mg tramadol/day to 30g kratom/day to 0,"Okay so this is my... 4th or 5th time qutting? Can't remember. This time kratom was not even the starting drug. 

I started using tramadol 6-8 month back not sure how long. Clean from kratom and other opiates for a few months. Buying 200mg tramadol pills for 1,8USD a pill seemed like such a wonderful idea back then when a couple of pills worked wonders. Like kratom on steroids. It's just when those couple of pills a day starts getting to 15 pills a day (minimum) and you have to pay a 700-900 USD a month it starts to get a real fucking problem.

3 months back I started feeling like shit after I took tramadol. Like seriously the days I worked afternoons/nigths as soon as I took some tramadol in the morning I felt like crap and felt like it the whole day. Those days I spend feeling like it was my first day at work, no momory of the shit I knew, feeling like I was 12 and full of anxiety. So I took more. It got WORSE. WHAT? This shit that has gotten me stability for a time makes me feel like shit.

Forward to easter this year. For years I have feel like I have betrayed my family. Not telling them anything. Hiding from them always putting up this front of me of ""happines"". So I could not hold it in. I told them everything. First my mom and then the rest of my family. They support me 100%. My family feels ""thing"" so they knew for a long time ""something"" was not right with me and I could feel it for years not telling them anything that they knew something was not right. 

March 25th I cut 3000mg of tramadol down to 800/day and started my taper. On April 16 I took my last dose of tramadol while switching to kratom. Yesterday at 11PM I took my last dose of kratom. 24h later am I drunk? Yes. Will I be able to sleep anyways? No. Will I call in sick tomorrow? Maybe. Will I ever take kratom or any other opiate again? Jesus christ I fucking hope not. Do I want to always speak the truth? Yes. Will I? No. Fuck me I do want to... I do try to but I can't promise that.

Fucking wish me luck motherfuckers.

Curious if yall could  help me decide whether to quit my kratom habit CT or to do a taper? If taper, it would be great to hear what worked for you!

&#x200B;

About my habit:

\- Daily usage for about 3 months. First month was 2-4g a day, now I'm up at 9g / day.

\- Have used kratom on/off a couple years ago, but never experienced any wd (but also never took it daily back then)

\- Practically zero experience with opiods/opiates prior to kratom, never abused any before

&#x200B;

Should I even be worried about WDs at my low-ish usage?

&#x200B;

Bonus question:

\- Does anyone know how long after quitting kratom it is safe to start naltrexone? My primary motivation for quitting kratom is so that I can start the Sinclair method for my much worse alcohol addiction.

I put that down to kratom and constipation, I even had to visit A and E a few times because of this, they could never find out the problem, I decided to quit because of this and the GI issues didn't and haven't resolved.

Fast forward until a month ago, Another visit to A and E and they decide that it was a kidney infection or stones, which in the end it was stones as I had a CT which showed nothing, so they prescribe me Ciprofloxacin, long story short that stuff has ruined my life, I have been ""floxxed"", if anyone doesn't know what that means id advise you to google it and never take a Fluoroquinolone antibiotic unless it is life or death, I can no longer walk unaided or even lift anything above say 5kgs, My life's been ruined because of it, lost my job, cannot go out and exercise with my daughter or even go out for a pint with my girlfriend, nothing.

So to present day, There isn't a day goes past without stomach pain, I can barely eat anything without having a massive reaction which includes pain in my stomach and my intestines, this has only gotten worse since I quit, the docs haven't been pursuing anything so I asked to be referred and I've been urgently referred to a better hospital to find out what's wrong.

I'm hoping to god that it is because of the kratom and there isn't anything more sinister at play, does anyone else share my experience? I've lost a ton of weight, quality of life is in the shitter, I was a big foodie and I've lost the only pleasure I have left basically.

Kratom doesn't work for me anymore. After taking the 4 tsp I waited an hour and took 2 more. Still no euphoric feeling just hopeless disappointment that I'm chasing something I can't catch. Normally I would dose now after 3 hours and then plan to taper but not this time. I'm just gonna stay off. I'm not gonna dose.

   Just wanted to vent and possibly get some opinions. Very long story short I‚Äôve got Crohn‚Äôs disease and I‚Äôm nearing the end of a very long opiate taper. Very proud of myself. 
   I‚Äôve been using Red Bali Kratom for around a year...at my peak I was taking roughly 12-14 caps in the morning and then again at night. I‚Äôve now got it down to 6 caps in the morning and 6 caps at night. From what I‚Äôm reading, relatively speaking that is not a high dose?

Due to the opiate taper I‚Äôve got Baclofen, Clonidine, Bispurone( Haven‚Äôt taken too scared) and I still have the opiates for another couple months if I want them. Prob gonna jump off early. 

  My fight/flight reflex is still on overdrive but I can‚Äôt shake this feeling that I could just stop. I‚Äôm becoming clearer and I‚Äôm realizing the Kratom I get is from a sketchy smoke shop and it has a picture of a fucking hula girl on it :(...idiot. I was desperate, the guy recommended it and it‚Äôs called Island Kratom. I‚Äôve been taking it for a while and I‚Äôve had no side effects really it‚Äôs been working great. I made the mistake of reading some of those bogus hit articles about how it‚Äôs not FDA regulated and I kept reading and it scared the shit out of me. 

6 caps in the morning 6 caps at night. I got meds, a yoga practice, Essentia water for days, a PTSD therapist, an amazing support system, a really smart and supportive wife. She just got me an Xbox Series X and we got a new 77inch LG CX tv and I‚Äôm motivated. 

Only I can answer this I know....but I‚Äôve freaked myself out. I know the dose I just took isn‚Äôt laced with ‚Äúother compounds or pesticides.‚Äù I‚Äôve got about 50 left. 

   I inspired one of my close friends to quit the drugs he was on. He‚Äôs not one to gather support and weapons more of a lone wolf stubborn cat. I don‚Äôt know exactly what he was on but it wasn‚Äôt good. He also took the worst steroids possible for almost 10 years.    He‚Äôs 35 now. 

   Unfortunately, he is having a psychotic break. He‚Äôs in a trance 90% of the day. He‚Äôs leaving his Mom‚Äôs house at night and going to my parents house to find me. I haven‚Äôt lived there in years. A few nights ago he slept in my parents backyard while they were in Florida. It was 30 something degrees and he was in a t-shirt. He was trying to get into my parents house and the police were called. 
   I just stopped in to check on the house and investigate and found his debit card in my parents fire pit. He also thinks he won the lottery and has a mansion by the ocean in Maine. He‚Äôs made a lot of mistakes but I‚Äôm the only one that hasn‚Äôt quit him. And I never will. 
    For that reason his brother thinks he‚Äôs trapped in his own mind and is trying to go to a place where he felt the safest and respected. That appears to be his ‚Äúfixation‚Äù
Unfortunately, fight or flight snaps him out of it and makes him lucid and coherent. The cops have been involved but adults have a lot of rights and the police can‚Äôt touch him. 

‚ÄúAre you a danger to yourself or anyone else sir?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
‚ÄúAny weapons?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
‚ÄúHave a nice day.‚Äù
And off they go.

They have a social worker coming to the house today to interview his Mom and Brother. The social worker is going to try and ‚ÄúTrigger‚Äù him to prove he‚Äôs out of control and is in fact a danger. We are all praying for that outcome.

I am heartbroken 

   Can someone tell me to chill :(
Do I go for this tonight? Or taper the 50. 

I just tapered Ketamine, Dilaudid and Oxycodone over the last year , I‚Äôm tough.

I finally told myself I've had enough and I wanted to experience what it felt like to be actually sober for longer than a week. I haven't been completely sober since I was 16. I'm 27 now. After I got off the hard stuff and alcohol, I knew I'd eventually have to lose the Kratom. I quickly realized that K was just as addicting and just as controlling of my life as the other substances. I tried and tried to taper but I just couldn't help but to add more scoops and justify buying more. So last week I said that after I'm out, I'm out. So here I am on day one, only 12 hours in but feeling the body aches and anxiety. Not to be religious or anything but I know that God will see me through this and give me the power to overcome yet another addiction. I have CBD to help me sleep and magnesium. Any other tips would be great... And I appreciate the fact that so many of you are understanding and have gone through this and have motivated and influenced me.

Now I am sober a month and a few days before the wedding and am so proud of myself.

I have heard stories of people on here who felt like they truely werent there for there kids growing up and I had to heed their advice and get outa that.

Amazingly I didn't go through severe withdrawals.

In the meantime, I was looking for safe/natural alternatives to give me the high, and pain relief that opiate gave me. Then I hear about kratom- I've been taking it daily for 7yrs now...in that meantime, I've gotten married, had 2kids, and multiple jobs, and have been financially stable, and have had to give plasma to make ends meat. In that whole time....I never, not ever went a day without dosing myself with kratom (with the exception of a few attempts to quit)

I will say this, even through all of my pharmaceuticals- Kratom has been the most difficult thing to get off of. It's affected me financially, it's affected my physical appearance/health, it's affected my job performance, my drive, and it's affected my relationships with my kids, and my wife.

For some reason kratom kept making me feel dizzy (no matter the dose). I felt that I had no other option than to quit. I think being forced to quit is a good thing though. I'm curious to see how my attitude changes. I'm a very high-anxiety and somewhat depressed person with a complete lack of self-confidence. I've seen kratom as something to medicate myself to alleviate my conditions. However, I sometimes wonder if kratom is potentiating those conditions instead.

To those who are planning on quitting cold turkey: day 1 was absolutely brutal. I'm sorry, but this shit is likely going to suck massive balls for you. I experienced extreme leg pain, restlessness, shit-quality sleep and some flu-like symptoms, BUT unlike many others in this sub, I feel that my symptoms have subsided by maybe 70% by day 2. 

Of course, withdrawal will be different for everyone, and I do understand that symptoms have a tendency to swing up and down for many people. However, I simply wanted to mention to those planning on quitting cold turkey that I am a testament to having withdrawal symptoms subside quickly. The main reason I'm telling you this is because after reading the horror stories of quitting from the others on this sub, I was reluctant to quit myself. Nonetheless, you are probably in for a ride if you are planning on quitting suddenly, but it is *possible* that your severe withdrawal symptoms will weaken quickly as mine have.

I ended up going to rehab at the beginning of last year simply because I was 100% unable to get off of kratom by myself. I've had issues with other substances- I get addicted to anything that makes me feel good and escape from reality. Has anyone been able to maintain long-term sobriety with/without this program? They talk about it being impossible to find an ""easier, softer, way"" and I'm just curious to see how this program works for different people.

Thanks for any input, have a great day y'all",15

Then I was diagnosed with Lyme Disease and found that kratom was really the only thing that helped lessen the symptoms of terrible body aches and brain fog. Because of this, my habit has become daily,  and I'm just not happy with that. Dosage has varied. I started with a low dose, then increased as my Lymes symptoms got worse, but have been tapering over the past few weeks.  Not as low as I would have liked, but lower than I have been before.

Now, I've been sick the last few days, felt awful,  and nothing has helped,  even kratom.  So yesterday I made the decision to go without.  Figure if I'm going to feel crappy anyway,  why bother taking anything.  Last night was my first night off. It wasn't a good night sleep. Restless arms, flip flopping from side to side. 

I started this post with the intent of asking if you all thought if I should keep tapering or go cold turkey from here.. But while writing,, I've made the decision to not take any kratom,  and see how I do. I've got work to get done today, so I'm hoping the distraction will be enough.

I finally had to tell her I‚Äôd seen enough for one day and needed to head home.

Does it get better?","Started taking kratom a month maybe 2..maybe 3? Idk. Seen where it was headed. It stopped being fun. Was taking to much extract. Was having intrusive thoughts and didn't want to do anything unless it was on kratom. On top of that, I was drinking and smoking pot daily. Kratom helped me stop drinking. However,  it has been 4 or 5 days since I last took some. Idk my daily dose because I started mixing extract with the normal stuff at random amounts. Probably way to much. 

I feel out of it. I feel negative and hopeless.  Like bad things are gonna happen. My life is gonna be ruined for some reason. It's so hard to even get up and move around. My thoughts are all over the place. Ive been addicted to alot of different things and have kicked them all. But this feels different. 

I don't wanna do anything.  I'm so depressed with random bouts of happiness.  Maybe even small suicidal thoughts. I'm barely able to clean my house without having to use all my will power. 

Is this all kratom W/Ds? Will it get better? How long? I feel like I'm going crazy and just wanna scream but at the same time I feel like things are getting better but then not. I dont even really feel like I'm here. May be other mental issues. 

I know this is nothing compared to people taking high doses for years. But I already could see me doing this for along time and I'm just trying to stop it in its tracks. I've done enough drugs in my past to know where it can lead. 

Everyone said kratom was different and natural.  I think people just talk it up to make themselves feel better about themselves being addicted. I really wish people didn't talk it up. It was my choice to do it, but I've even had the person who told me about it say that I shouldn't come on here and talk about it because it'll make kratom look bad. I was told it was this perfect substances. I knew better,  but I did it anyway and now here I am. 

Should I stay going cold turkey?  Or is tapering a viable option assuming that I actually take lower doses until I dont take it at all. I'm just fed up. Ive lived my whole life just trying to have a good time. And these days, I can't even sit down without feeling like a lazy piece of shit. 

My options are 1. Get better and have better habits or 2. Just give up and die ten years from now on street probably.   

Fuck man. I hope this is the kratom and that it gets better. Life like this isn't worthwhile.  Worse part is. What if it is not the kratom.  Maybe I'm just fucked up. 

I just want to have myself back. Personality and love and positive thoughts. 

None of this matters if I can't stop my last habit(which is smoking pot daily)  

I've come along way and when I started taking kratom.  It just added more work for me to do. I hate myself.  I just wanna feel happy AND sober again. I just want this non sense to stop.

Because I preached and fully supported tapering, but after months of failed attempts, I said FUCK IT. And threw away 400 dollars worth of kratom. 

I simply cannot taper. My brain is wired for either massive indulgence, or complete abstinence. In my brain, there's no grey area. There's no ladder to make small steps. The radio is either on maximum volume, or muted. 

Unfortunately I do that with everything. Food, collecting things, authors, musicians, etc..... When I latch onto something, I'm going all the fucking way. Fast. 

So look, I love you all. And I truly did (and still do?) think that tapering is more gentle on the brain than CT, but god damn it I can't do it. I'm disappointed. And now add to that, scared, unprepared, overthinking. I'm sorry for not practicing what I preached. I hope it's not hypocritical, I'm simply unable. My love and best wishes to all of you.",15
2021-05-10 00:13:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/n8vnct/im_3_weeks_sober_and_feeling_amazing_here_is_my/,I‚Äôm 3 weeks sober and feeling amazing! Here is my story of how I got off Kratom and now feeling physically and emotionally fantastic!,"Hi everyone! So I‚Äôve been following this thread for quite a while now and even posted a few times for advice. I was a heavy Kratom user for about 3 years. I was a high level gymnast and injured my shoulder badly in 2018. I ended up needing surgery and my coach recommended that I try Kratom instead of taking painkillers because they are addicting (big mistake because both are if abused). I realized that Kratom helped my pain and anxiety so I continued taking it. My coach told me it was a natural herb so i thought that there was no harm in taking it to help my pain and anxiety. Clearly this was a big mistake and I should‚Äôve done my research. I began doing it about once a day and in the beginning of 2020, I was doing it multiple times a day. This is when I started to question Kratom because I had cravings all the time. I did more research and realized that if you abuse it, it can be very addictive. But, I was in denial and continued to do it to help me deal with stress from nursing school and chronic pain. By July of 2020 I realized that I had a problem and needed help. I came onto this thread for advice and a lot of people were extremely supportive. I took their advice and tried tapering. This didn‚Äôt work for me. I didn‚Äôt have the willpower to do it so I said screw it, I‚Äôll just keep doing it. I came on here a few more times in 2020 and in the beginning of this year but I never followed through with my plans. I couldn‚Äôt stop taking the Kratom! I was so addicted and dependent on it that I could not physically or mentally stop. It was so bad that most of the money I made from working was spent on Kratom. Then about a month ago, I decided that ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. Kratom was taking over my life and I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. I tried to stop cold turkey and by the end of the first day, I thought I was gonna die (I know I‚Äôm dramatic but I felt awful). I never had such bad anxiety in my life (and I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks that have landed me in the ER), and I had many withdrawal symptoms that I‚Äôm assuming most of you are aware of. Kratom is pretty much an opioid so you will have the same withdrawals as you would if you were coming off opioids (if you highly abused Kratom). I finally admitted to my parents about my problem because I was desperate and needed help. They said they could help me through it and joked that they can always send me to a rehab. After they did research and saw how harmful Kratom is on the body, they begged me to go to rehab, and so I did. I can honestly say that it was the best decision I have ever made in my entire life. Two days later I got on a flight and began my journey to sobriety. I was nervous because I‚Äôve heard some scary stories about rehabs, but this rehab was amazing. I swear it was like a little vacation. For the first 3 days (detox stage), they gave me medicine for withdrawals and I felt perfectly fine. After that, I felt pretty good! I had some restless legs for about 3 days after stopping the withdrawal medication and minor anxiety but that was it (3 days of PAWS and then I was fine). They always have comfort meds if you need it but I didn‚Äôt need them. It was that easy for me!! I‚Äôve seen a lot of stories about how it took people a month to feel great so i thought this would be a long and difficult process, but it wasn‚Äôt. Everyone reacts different so this might not be the case for every person quitting but it was for me. I have been a heavy Kratom user for 3 years and was spending about $60-$80 a day on Kratom shots, but it only took a week to feel great and back to how I was before starting Kratom. The rehab was supposed to be a month long, but I was medically cleared to go home after 2 weeks. I can honestly tell you that I feel amazing and have no cravings at all! There are about 5 gas stations within a mile of me that sell Kratom so I expected it to be difficult. I‚Äôve been home for a week and have even went to the gas stations for gas and I was not tempted. I suffer from severe anxiety and I used Kratom to numb it so I know there might be times I will want it, but being sober and off Kratom is so much better. I feel like I lost years of my life being on Kratom so heavily. I started to appreciate life more and enjoy feeling my emotions. I feel happy, sad, anxious, excited, tired, along with many other emotions, and I appreciate every single one of them. I‚Äôve learned healthy ways to cope with anxiety now and it‚Äôs working so well. Overall, I am so happy I went to rehab because I‚Äôm sober and feeling amazing. Good luck with everyone who is quitting Kratom! I know you can do it and if you need any advice, feel free to message me. Rehab might not be for everyone, but if you were taking the same amount of Kratom that I was and you weren‚Äôt successful when trying to taper or do it CT, rehab is always an option. It might only be 1-2 weeks and you can go back to your life and feel great. It took me less than a week to feel great and have no withdrawals or cravings. I had no struggles emotionally or physically after only a week into rehab. I‚Äôm not saying that it was impossible for me to quit cold turkey at home, but I am not mentally strong and know that there was a high chance I would start Kratom again if the withdrawals continued to be as bad as they were on day one. Good luck everyone!!!! Feel free to contact me if you need some support :)",11

2021-05-09 20:43:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/n8rs5x/quit_9_months_ago/,Quit 9 months ago,"Hello, I am/was a long time lurker in this sub. I only bought powdered Kratom from a local headshop. I have never posted before but woke up feeling like I should share this. I probably won't be back visiting the sub much. It feels kind of like ""graduating"" from school or something. You turn the page, so to speak. If you were to take away only one general idea from this post, I would want it to be that since I quit taking Kratom I feel like I got my life back. I find myself doing really clich√© things like watching the birds and butterflies, crying during romantic comedy movies, and laughing hysterically when the moment arises. I am in college (my senior year begins this coming Fall) and for the first time in my entire academic career I just finished a semester with a 3.92 GPA average. For context, I had never achieved above a 2.3 in a semester. 

I was part of the ""kratom is like coffee"" club. Instead I now realize it is a drug with hazardous abuse potential. Yet it helped me stop drinking when I first found it and I still am (sort of) thankful for how it made it possible to quit drinking within a super short period, like a week. I drank up to six beers for 4+ years, daily (sometimes even way more).

It took me a surprisingly long time to realize how Kratom was negatively impacting my life. I had smoked weed for years and that didn't stop when I quit drinking/found kratom, so that really euphoric feeling that kratom gave me was masked by other things I was doing. After a year of daily morning kratom smoothies, I started to bring it everywhere I went. I'd put it in applesauce for lunch or swish it down in water (yuck) whenever I ""wanted"" to. It slowly started to dawn on me after two years that I was taking it more frequently. Towards the end, I would take it right before bed because otherwise I wouldn't be able to sleep well--which was strange to me since the lower doses I was taking should have been mostly like coffee. That is when it became apparent, I was withdrawing at night when I wasn't able to take any due to sleeping. Finally, in August last year I decided to quit because I looked and felt like a drug addict. I am so grateful I was able to before it got worse.

I visited this sub every day for months reading and rereading posts regarding questions of every kind. Does X help, does Y effect me differently now, will Z make a difference? I had so much anxiety about everything. If I had anything wrong--a new lump on my lymph nodes, my heart rate was sporadic, a shaking feeling throughout my body--I would research it all day/night to see what it could be. I think this was excessive, but it made me want to stay sober so I could find out if something was actually wrong. In hindsight, I think it was very helpful because what I needed was a distraction. It also made me go to the doctor for the first time in over 4 years. I didn't even have a general physician in my new town of 6 years. That was really helpful because he told me I was fine physically, lol. I kept smoking weed for 8 months after my quit. Eventually I realized that I had incredible anxiety from quitting kratom and perhaps also from quitting alcohol before that as well. Having smoked weed since high school, I always thought I would smoke it forever. But about a month ago I realized that the weed was definitely amplifying all of the worse parts of quitting kratom. Anxiety, sleep, tinnitus, eating habits, daily routine--all things weed made worse so I quit. I think since I quit kratom I just felt like I could quit anything if I put my mind to it. That goes to show just how freaking powerful and negative kratom is.  I imagine coffee isn't helping either, but I still drink a lot of coffee. Sometimes we keep a vice, I guess.

If I were asked to offer advice to someone on day 1 or anywhere along the journey, I'd tell them this. Exercise or spend time outside every day that you can. Don't drink alcohol or smoke weed if you can help it.  It is so damn tempting I know, but the pay off is huge. I had to stop drinking coffee for about 4 months and then reintroduced it slowly. Instead I drank very light teas (steep the bag for half the time, or something like that). Try to get excited about healthy food--I started to think of it as my new drug. Plan out all your meals, it gives you something to do. Drink a ton of water, you need it. For me, vitamins helped out a lot. I took a B complex for awhile and it helped immensely. Anytime you catch yourself googling ""will 1 beer make it better"", ""does weed help"", or ""can I take Kava instead"", just take some deep breaths. Breathing is huge. At key moments throughout my day, I stop for 2 minutes (literally) and I take deep breaths. That Wim Hof thing is probably super legit, though I never I tried it myself. For sleeping well I focused on exercising daily, eating dinner early, and drinking chamomile tea. I run 2 miles daily now. I am pretty sure that for me, melatonin/valerian/passionflower teas were giving me restless leg syndrome for a long time, at least three months before I stopped taking/drinking them. I avoid it and just stick to chamomile tea. Every day you are able to stay as sober as possible is a day closer to not needing some substance to help you wake up, stay awake, fall asleep.

Sorry if this was hard to read or sporadic, I think I just wanted some closure. Good luck everyone, **I am so glad I quit.**",32

It's been a miracle for my mood and anxiety, but I can't afford to keep taking it, and I know it's not healthy in the long run. It's also making me constipated and lately my tolerance is keeping me from getting a nice buzz.

How fucked will I be if I quit c/t off 15-20 grams per day? I have been taking at least 5-10 grams per day for around 4 months, and the last month there were a few days where I took close to 30gs.

Last year I was taking Kratom daily for maybe a week or two, and when I stopped I was DEPRESSED as fuck for 2 days straight, then just meh, and then back to normal.

What am I in for? I have a benzo script if that might help. I have about 4 grams left I was going to take tomorrow morning, but them I'm out. Should I re-up just so I can taper off? Pretty worried as someone who has bad anxiety and takes an antidepressant for moderate depression.",3

My plan was to divide those in 5 servings. 7-8 am, 11 am, 3 pm, 6-7 pm, 9-10 pm. I have found that this is the best possible way you can arange it since its almost always the same interval. I dropped down half a gram each 3-4 days depending how i felt (you have to really want tho). I always kept the last daily dosage (9-10 pm) half a gram more than the rest since i found that it help alot with the sleep. When i hit 15-16 gpd I found out its getting a bit harder to drop half a gram from each dosage so i started to split it up between more dosages so for example I dropped 0,25g from two dosages or sometimes just 0,1g from three dosages. Now im at 13 gpd and I really feel like this is working for me. Another thing that HELPED ALOT was giving ALL my kratom to someone else to measure my dosages each day since my will at the last tapper was too weak. Hope this is going to help someone. You can do it too, and if your will is weak for tapper, give it so someone else and dont order anything. That mental separation helped alot.",4

At first I thought it was the best thing ever but after my first minor break with it I had horrible opioid withdrawal symptoms. 
I had diahria, was unable to sleep, and my arm would spasm uncontrollable. 
Now I know better than to just cold turkey it. 
When I take it I take around 10-20gpd.
Does anyone have any ideas of the best ways to get off of it?
I have read that weaning off of it would be the most pleasant way. 
For instance, maybe take 4gs in the morning and then some at night till I can completely drop it.
Sleep is essential for me and I cannot function without so I do not want me becoming sober to be affected by it but at this point I need to be completely sober as I do not want to be dependent on any substances.

I was buying them from her to help get off kratom. What was intended as a quick taper turned into 4 months on subs. 

By the last month I was down to less than .25mg a day (down from 4mg). Still, coming off that small amount was NOT easy. I had to get back on kratom (more than I was using before subs) and daily Imodium just to help. 

For those who have quit successfully: what meds/supplements helped the most? I‚Äôm prescribed 2400mg of gabapentin a day. But that alone is not enough to help me stop. It‚Äôs not as therapeutic for me bc my tolerance is so high. 

But I do have a LOT of Lyrica (pregabalin) and baclofen otw (likely arriving this month). Does this sound good enough for a CT quit from around 20gpd? 

Before you warn me of Lyrica withdrawals, I used to be prescribed it, so I‚Äôm aware. But also will not have to worry about withdrawals since I have gabapentin for after.

"" I was wrong!","Well, hello to you fellow quitters and those looking to quit. I decided it was time to stop hiding my addiction in private and share it with people who can relate and understand. 

My story started in November 2019. I had my appendix taken out and was given a limited amount of pain meds afterwards to help. (2 days worth). Well, this led me to kratom. I was still in pain and had to work my 50+ an hour labor job and the pain was way uncomfortable. I had to extend my pain relief and I chose kratom. I had heard about it from being a fellow opiate addict and thought to myself ""hey, this is nothing like opiates and I'm going to just use it for a few days while I recover from my surgery. "" 

This led me to a head shop of a place that I knew had it and I freaky had zero knowledge behind how it worked.  Sadly, I didn't turn to powder, capsules, or tea.  I turned to a kratom extract shot. (Big mistake) I remember the first experience was getting some after work and then preparing to take it at work first thing in the morning. So, I did this. I had no idea how the euphoria and pain relief was gong to be so intense. It felt wonderful at that time.  I considered myself lucky to find this herbal supplement that I thought would not be addicting like pain killers. Boy was I absolutely freaking wrong!

This one week habit I told myself I would do turned into weeks, months, and now over a year and a half later in still tied to this green monster on my back. My use had revolved around mostly extracts.  Throughout this year and half I have used shots, capsules of all different shapes sizes and colors. I'm currently on these extract pills that are made in my home state and I really don't know the amount I'm taking and the information of ingredients are very vague.  Anyways, I have gotten to the point I take 16 of these pills a day. It's eating my money and has slowly stolen my soul. This substance is not ""like coffee"" it is a drug. I cannot agree with anyone out there otherwise now. This has been a substance I have quit every night and used again the next morning for the past few months this has been my feelings towards it. I hate it, I'm numb, I feel no joy in anything I used to love (music, video games, art, hiking etc.) 

I have become this empty shell of a person because of this substance. I am not happy, I live every day in regret and shame over using it and to top it off, no one in my life knows that I'm addicted to kratom. I truly want to quit. I really do. My desire is so strong, but I break every day so easily. It's a toxic ""ground hog day"" life. I love every day doing the exact same thing. Getting up, using, telling myself in going to quit that night and then wake up and do it all over again. 

I apologize for the long rant, but most of this is for me talking about it to somebody or anybody about this dark secret life of mine. I have realized that I'm unable to taper (I've tried so many times I couldn't count). I've only stopped this substance for a few days here and there. Anywhere from 2-7 days.  I have never made it more than 7 days. 

I am at a point now that I can't afford this anymore, but also don't have an option to go into rehab right now due to personal issues regarding my life that it can't be found that I'm using something. This post is to tell everyone that in taking my last dose today. I am left with no choices and I know that I have to pay the price for my poor choices now. If you have experienced withdrawal, this withdrawal is a lot like pain killerdoess. (Insomnia, sweating, chills, the whole body aches, running nose, RLS, no appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and more to just the physical symptoms). The hardest part for me is the intense mental withdrawals. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression normally without using a substance to cope. That being said, the mental comes with (hardcore cravings, severe anxiety/panic attacks, heavy waves of depression, insane ruminating thoughts, feeling like your going crazy, and more etc.). 

Because I have stopped few times for a few days I know what I'm getting ready to deal with when I drop this horrible substance that has taken my life from me. I'm ready to take my life back and I wanted to reach out and tell my story and share this secret with someone or anyone. I'm tired of being quiet about it. I do have my hands on some helper medications that may ease some of the pain that if about to come, but just from my experience, it will not completely let you escape the price you have to pay. So, to my people who have quit, you are the strongest people I know to make it out of this trap and get your life back. To those thinking about quitting, please do everything you can to get you there. This substance is stealing everything precious to our life and soul. We are being robbed by fake happiness and escape and it is no longer time to run from whatever got you here in the first place. I hope that I can just reach out here to this support group to get help and strength from others for this quitting experience. I've been lurking this forum for months and I think that if someone can quit this, I can quit this. 

Once again, I'm sorry for long rant, but my plan from here is to post my day by day experience on my quit. Tomorrow will be day one and it is scary as hell. Thanks for listening to me and I hope to talk with others about this as walk through hell to get my life back. I need it back, I want it back, I want to feel something if just anything again. Thank you to all of you on this forum. Your stories have slowly been giving me the strength and mindset to just do this! I hope all of you are finding a way out and I am proud as hell to all of you that have gotten out. We can do this, but we should not do it alone. We need each other. 

(I will be posting my day by day quit as I do this and I'm looking for words of encouragement and any feedback that can help me finally succeed in letting go of this green monster on my back)

Peace and love to all of you. Thanks for listening.

********************************************************************************
UPDATE:
DAY 1: Alright, well I woke up with my usual anxiety and dread. I think the anxiety was more the fear of not taking my dose today. I got to about 24 hours without dosing and I started to feel super lethargic and I feel like all my muscles are starting to lightly ache. There is slight runny nose starting now and of course I am having a large amount of anxiety. For me personally, I don't feel like my withdrawal really takes full effect until about 36 hours out. I'll be coming up on that tonight when I am supposed to be sleeping. I am 100% sure I will not sleep well tonight. So far, no, I do not feel good. I'm out of it, lethargic, sore, and strung out with anxiety. This is where I am at so far. I will update tomorrow. Fingers crossed it won't be complete hell tonight. Thanks everyone for the support.

UPDATE:
DAY 2: Well, slept like shit. Maybe got 2 hours of solid sleep. Tossing and turning, cold/hot flashes, sweating from every pore, runny nose, whole body aches, feel completely out of it, extreme anxiety, lethargy, and yeah you get the point. I'm on withdrawals 100%. It has not been a good day. I'm mega dosing vitamin c and it takes some of the edge off. I have some clonodine and it seems to stop the sweating, hot/cold flashes and a reduction in anxiety. No, it's not perfect and does not eliminate all withdrawals. It is like putting a bandaid on an open hole in your body, but any help is okay. I doubt I'll sleep tonight besides how tired I am, but I'm in college full time and have to push through either way to get my work done. I highly suggest moving around a lot and going for a walk. The longer I sit down or lay down, the more I feel like shit. Things are what they are and I expected all of this. That's my update for day 2.

UPDATE:
DAY 3: Well, pretty much the exact same as day two. Not much sleep. All the of the symptoms still feel the same. I just think I'm getting way more tired today. The lack of sleep is kinda kicking my butt and brain. I have maintained taking vitamin c, clonodine, and added chamomile tea 3 times today for the anxiety. Like I said before, this just has helped take the edge off enough to make it slightly bearable. I'm hoping for a curve in better symptoms by day 5 or 6. We'll see. For now if you just refer to day two and day three, and you'll get the idea. Thanks for the support everyone. üôè

UPDATE:
DAY 4: Alright a little more sleep. Maybe 4 hours broken up, but more than day 2 and 3. I'll take what I can get. Today I woke up sneezing. Like 5 times in a row and repeated this process most of today. Super runny nose and drainage. I still have full body aches. It's like every muscle and joint is just mildly aching. It's pretty uncomfortable. Ihave no appetite, but have been forcing myself to eat small amounts of oatmeal throughout the day. I've eaten more today than I did that last 3. Food actually seems to make you feel slightly better. I probably should have forced it sooner. Still taking vitamin c, clonodine, and chamomile. It really does take the edge off. I highly recommend it. I'm still sweating and getting hot and cold flashes as well. My body really seems to over heat at night. Like I get so hot my ears start burning. I have to get up and walk a lot. My legs seem to ache a lot more than the rest of my body. I fortunately have not exactly had terrible RLS. I do toss and turn at night a lot though, so that's probably my version of it a long with the achy legs. Anyways, hoping for more sleep and to feel a bit clearer in my head than I have. Will update tomorrow. Thanks for the support.

UPDATE:
DAY 5:
Alright, a little more sleep. Maybe 5 hours broken up, but I slept for longer amounts this time. That's good news. I still am achy, runny nose, sneezing, anxiety, mood swings, no appetite, sweating. It feels like things might be lightening a bit, but I'm not going to fully say that until another day passes. Still taking vitamin c, clonodine, and chamomile tea 3x a day. It takes the edge off. I am going for walks for the aching feeling. I seem to hurt less with movement, but it's still hard to feel like doing anything. Obviously, tired and lethargic still. I'll update tomorrow. Thanks for the support.

UPDATE:
DAY 6,7,8: I totally spaced updating this the last few days. I started to get more sleep on day 6, 7, and 8. I am feeling more alive in the morning. I am still having mood swings and anxiety, but the sweating, hot and cold chills, aching muscles, runny nose etc. Have all started to subside significantly. I feel like I'm still lethargic. Most of my withdrawal symptoms seem more mental at this point. I get cravings and fight it with immediate distractions and the anxiety and depression are kind of all over the place.i feel better physically though. I have increased to walking twice a day for 30 minutes and listen to music. I kind of forgot how much I loved music. Kratom took the joy out of everything for me. I am starting to feel better though and I have ditched the clonodine. I still take chamomile tea and vitamin c though. I figure my body needs the vitamins.  I don't really know if anyone is following this post anymore. But, day 6-8 are where I really felt a big shift in symptoms physically. I know the mental stuff is going to linger for a while. I guess I am just glad to be feeling like I'm feeling again if you know what I mean. I'm not sure if anyone wants me to comments to update here since I haven't heard from anybody much since my day one and two days. I guess I might make my updates more time in between. Hopefully, someone is reading this for hope. Thanks for the support from this place and the people who initially replied. Hope is out there for everyone if you want to quit. I'll update later. Peace!",39

First three months were minor doses a day( under 10g). The reason why im going to give CT a shot is because a couple of months ago i actually forgot to take kratom for like 40 hours and didn‚Äôt really feel anything. Once i realized i hadn‚Äôt taken any i started getting anxious in the car, I basically gave myself withdrawal symptoms. This week ive been really anxious because now the idea about quitting is in my head but Im trying to go into this with a positive mindset. I dont have any previous drug withdrawal experiences. I have a ton of baclofen and was wondering if that could work for a couple of days to mitigate withdrawal symptoms? Of course im not planning on using for more than a week max. Any advice on how much and when? 

Other supplements i have:
Human growth hormone
black seed oil 
5htp
L theanine
L phenylalanine
Vitamin c

2021-05-09 12:35:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/n8hvlr/day_2/,Day 2,"Happy mother's day to all the moms. Today is day 2 ct for me. It's my 2nd attempt in the past few months to quit. The last time I tapered. I didn't want to go through that again so I'm trying ct this time. I have had some digestive and sinus stuff, restless body (not just legs) and craving but I'm doing ok. I've been taking kratom pretty consistently for 1 1/2-2 years but never at very high doses. I took red and only took it once per day because I loved the checked out feeling it gave me at the end of the workday. But having struggled myself years ago with substance abuse issues, and actually working in the field, I realized pretty early on, even at relatively low doses, I was at least really mentally addicted. I've stopped for short periods over the time I've been taking it,  but always went back obviously.  To be honest,  even though I stopped 2 days ago, I still hadn't even decided for myself why it's so bad for me to take outside of not wanting to be addicted to anything. I've been oscillating between feeling proud of myself for stopping and rationalizing why it's not such a big deal to take (the addict part of my personality). I never had a real focused goal of why I was stopping, and I can already feel how that is going to lure me back into using if I don't get clear and focused right now.
So today I'm working on stating the reasons why I want to be kratom free aside from not wanting to be addicted to anything. So far I've come up with: because I want to feel empowered with the self discipline of practicing stuff I already know helps when I actually do it consistently (meditation,  exercise,  yoga...). AND even more-I want to feel motivation and inspiration in my life again. One of the biggest things I feel kratom took from me was the passionate/feeling/creative/expressive part of myself that fueled and motivated my actions. I also hate how it has made me look older-it's really aged my face, so I'm really looking forward to a more youthful glow again. 

I really appreciate this group. Thank you for creating a place to share and process something a lot of people just don't understand. I've found that most or at least many people have no idea what kratom is, let alone how addictive it is and how it can affect one's life. 

Would anyone else be willing to share their reasons for quitting? I think it might really help me get through the next few days of this.",8
2021-05-09 11:36:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/n8go1o/i_began_my_taper_by_just_finally_getting_that/,I began my taper... by just finally getting that scale and keeping my dose steady for the past week...,"So I‚Äôve been wanting to taper for a while now. On Kratom for over 6 years at this point... and I dose too often. I know that. 

I used to just scoop up some and take it toss n wash, never measured. When I did measure, just to see what I was doing, my typical dose was 5-7 grams. And I would dose... sometimes again within the hour, when my anxiety was too much. Once a week or so, I‚Äôd get terrible nausea in the afternoon cause I know I over did it... then I‚Äôd just continue on as normal. I hate it.

Got a travel scale. Decided I‚Äôm only going to do 5 gram doses and I will dose every 2 hours to start. Doing that, I dose about 40 gpd. But after a couple days of that, I can feel myself on edge all the time. That uneasiness that I can only attribute to my body wanting more Kratom.

But I just keep going on. I will only do the 40 gpd and no more. I won‚Äôt dose bigger than 5 grams. There is usually one dose, my second for the day, that comes an hour after the first, but all the others are spread 2 hours at least, sometimes more when I‚Äôm busy and distracted enough. 

I feel a little hope. That unease I‚Äôm feeling must mean I‚Äôm taking less than normal. So it‚Äôs a damn start. I want to dose less often but I‚Äôm just... I haven‚Äôt been able to get there yet.

Once I‚Äôve normalized a few more days, I‚Äôll begin the smaller drops, maybe .25-.5 per dose reductions for a week at a time. 

I hope I can do this. I write here just... to write it out, to put it out there that I started. Finally...

Well I wish I had a better reason besides mild anxiety and depression problems. Im 21 and feel like I've wasted a year of money and my life to taking it to feel normal. I was under the impression that since it was legal to take it would be safe and have no meaningful downsides to the drug. Boy was I wrong . I dont have a set amount I take tbh in a day, I just take it whenever I please in a tsp cup, dry and chase it with a drink. All I know is I take ALOT over the day in small amounts at a time. 


    The biggest problem I've had with using the stuff is it greatly suppresses my appetite. I've already been a skinny male before taking weighing about 120-125lbs. It suppresses my appetite to the point that over the (around) 11 months I've tooken it I've only been eating 1 meal a day. My scale in my bathroom has died but when I'm noticeably looking like a skeleton its getting too scary for me to handle. I could be on the edge of anorexic tbh. I've never been addicted to anything else besides nicotine which could also be a appetite suppressant but I've always eaten fine with it and that's too much to quit 2 things at once. It's also already stressful on me bc I'm unemployed and have to deal with the stress of finding a job again, being late on some Bill's, and having to sell personal things to pay for some stuff. But I'm tired of not being free. 


    I lay in bed all day, take kratom, watch videos on my phone and do nothing. My gf is the only person who knows about my kratom addiction and im too embarrassed to tell anyone else. Quitting cold turkey is the best method I believe because it will result in a quicker but harsher recovery and that's usually the way I do things in life, pain is only temporary. 


Wish me luck guys, love all yall. Any questions, comments, and support would be greatly appreciated.",30

I feel like I have more energy now to deal with that and to come up with better ideas for coping. The cravings still hit, and to be honest, there were some intense ones last weekend and this weekend. Kratom really gave me courage to do bold shit or a mental break from stressful shit. So I just had to get through it relying only on myself. Life didn‚Äôt magically improve at all. Not in the slightest. But I‚Äôm handling things so much better.

Back at the end of my use, I was sleeping horribly. I was constantly waking up, uncomfortable, itchy, have to go to the bathroom or feeling totally dehydrated. My back felt terrible every morning. Id get horrible migraines each week. My ability to focus was awful. 

I noticed within a few days of my quit that my terrible back pain was gone. My sleep is amazing - I don't even need magnesium or supplements to sleep. I feel physically well all day long. I've lost 10lbs but my arms and stomach are much more toned. I look very healthy and I've really not worked out or anything. 

These 6 weeks have been a challenge, but I'm so grateful I stayed on the path. If you're wondering if you'll ever make it through the shitty WDS, yes you absolutely will. If the PAWS feels unbearable, know that it won't always last. Life feels so much better without Kratom, really truly.",38

I've only been using since January to get off codeine and probably maxed out at 8 gpd, but most frequently 6 gpd. I've been using them every day since January and quit ct about two weeks ago, then noticed I had terribly restless upper arms, shoulders and back, so took an amitriptyline to try and find some sleep relief, which horrifically worsened symptoms. After that, I started taking kratom again, around 4g at night only, because it was the only thing that helped. I didn't realise it was linked until very recently, when I was searching for restless arms and back and couldn't find anything on Dr Google at all until I landed on a post from this sub. As a result, I quit ct again two days ago, determined to just grit my teeth and get through. 

I thought with the short term usage and negligible daily dosage next to the long term users who quit on here, I'd be safe from withdrawal symptoms. Is this normal? Is it almost definitely related to kratom? I'm taking magnesium citrate, cbd and I've ordered some magnesium lotion and spray but nothing I've tried so far really staves it off. It's fucking unbearable and my law exams are around the corner so I'm a bit nervous about the sleepless nights and inability to stay still. I don't want to go back to taking it, but holy fuck this is an unpleasant symptom.",4

Well this quit I got my hands on some clonidine to try something new and had used it at night until day 16 and thought I'd run out, and coincidentally my RLS died down a ton. Well last night I noticed I actually had one more .1mg tab and wanted some deep sleep, so decided to take that and went to bed. Well an hour and a half later I am RIPPED OUT OF SLEEP with the most gnarly RLS and immediately thought ""Okay, it's gotta be the clonidine"" and did some research as to how this could be possible.

(Can't include links but Google search ""Clonidine Lowering Dopamine and check out the top result from PubMed)

Found this study that shows clonidine can tank dopamine levels. In this case it was done on rats and was IV but it's a possible explanation as to why it seems to be effing with me.

Anyways just throwing this personal anecdote out there. It could be that my RLS is heavily dependent on my low dopamine as opposed to my adrenals firing off heavily. For 99% of you clonidine will probably be a Godsend for you. But if you're taking it and continually feeling absolutely rekt with RLS, try dropping it (taper down if you've been using a while)  and see if that resolves it.

Just wanted to throw this anecdote out there, cheers!",19

(and why switching to larger, less frequent doses might work for you)","I've been tracking my kratom use since I started using it daily in 2017, but I basically did nothing with that information. 2020 saw a huge spike in my grams per day, so my New Year's resolution was to start graphing all the data I collect, so I could visualize my trends. I started a ""taper"" in mid February that reduced my GPD pretty well, but I fell off that as soon as it got hard, but I continued to reduce my individual doses at a comfortable rate.

By April, I had reduced individual doses to just 1.5g, and my GPD hovered around 12 except for days where I would stay awake just taking kratom, but I was still taking them every 3 hours religiously, feeling lots of anxiety and pressure in the last hour, not really being able to concentrate or enjoy anything until I redosed.

I thought I had reached my limit, because dosing lower than 1.5g was basically imperceptible (except for the first one of the morning, which would get rid of any forthcoming withdrawal symptoms and/or abstinence anxiety), so on May 4th I decided to just try something radical because I was tired of not making progress. I've read on this sub that kratom lasts way longer than 3 hours, and thats just when the ""rush""/peak of the high ends, and I've known for a long time that my issue comes from trying to maintain that high, and my Pavlovian need to drink tea every 3 hours. So I upped my morning dose to 3.5g, was able to maintain on that all day, and only had one other similar sized dose in late afternoon. For the first time in years, I was able to only have two doses in a day that I was awake for the majority of it (thats what those valleys are in the graph), and have been only dosing twice a day since.

I know it's still really soon to say I've made a breakthrough or something, but I feel very confident that I will be able to reduce my GPD to at least 5g using this method, then maybe even further with just one dose and then maybe I can finally jump off.",12

I'm considering suboxone to taper off a kratom habit. Why? Because I'm a 25 year opiate addict alcoholic that's been using kratom pretty much every day for over 10 years and I want to stop. But the tapering never works for me because of inconsistent product. I'm finding that tapering off my typical 28g a day kratom habit difficult because the alkaloid content can vary so much from one batch to the other. I typically have a few batches from a few suppliers on hand and it seems next to impossible to get a reliable tapering schedule. Withdraw can occur seemingly at random with a very precisely measured dose. I use digital scales. I know what I'm doing. 

With a prescription drug and a Doctor, I can reasonably expect the dose to work every time with a medically guided tapering protocol. So tell me...Is this crazy? Is it overkill? I find kratom withdrawal to be pretty uncomfortable. And the insomnia is dangerous in my line of work. I wanna hear from people that have used similar drugs especially because I'm an old school junkie... I've only ever taken methadone. A habit is a habit.

Perhaps its a touch subjective but i was taking up to 80gpd and if i thought CT was the definitively best method i may not be free from kratom today.


Was using such a large amount that CT brought me to such pain i took more kratom and resigned myself to the fact its impossible.

For me, a steady taper worked best

Just because you try - and fail to quit DOESNT mean its impossible - but it might behoove you to try to shake things up and try to cease use in a different fashion to see if its more conducive towards your personal psychology


You can't avoid the pain from withdrawal - anticipate that - but one method might be more tolerable for you than another 

Just remember - theres more than one way to skin a cat (a disturbing saying lol)

And perhaps one method of skinning might be easier for you than another.


Some folks do best with CT. 
Some, a  quick or slow taper. 

How they deal with their 'night dose'. 

Whether they take comfort meds/nootropics/ vitamins (im talking l-theanine/vit c level stuff - not xanax or subs) 

...whereas other folks would do best to embrace the pain to sear the misery in their heads to discourage future use

Maybe im wrong but i feel like addiction is such a uniquely nuanced enemy - tailoring its corruption to your personal weaknesses - that everyone's unique context should be taken into account how exactly they should quit

I may be missing something fundamental but it makes me worried when i see folks giving people struggling definitive sounding advice as to how to cease use.

I know the title may seem funny, it's actually true.  This has been a very hard journey and in order to make it through the days, especially in the beginning, I had to do everything I could to make things manageable.  I started a very strict regimen of vitamins, made myself workout 5 days a week, started drinking a gallon of water a day, even started meditation and breathing exercises.  At first alot of this was hell and executed very sloppy, but over time it became easier and easier.  I started to really hang on to these things as motivation to get though the day and actually started looking forward to them.  I also noticed if I skipped any of these daily deeds, then I would feel SOOO much worse.  So it became my job (along with my reg job and life..lol)

Now I am so grateful to say that I am Kratom free and I have really healthy established habits that I never want to let go of.  I feel so much better, look so much better, I'm gained a lot of strength.  This is only the beginning and I am so excited to become the best version of myself I can be!  

Please don't get me wrong.  It's not all butterflies and rainbows.  I still have hard days, but things are way better and I feel I have a healthy reward system starting to reestablish.

If you are on the fence about quitting make the leap.  It will be hard, and will test you, but it will be so worth it and you will come out the other side so much stronger.  You get one life.  You deserve to be the best version of yourself!  You can do it!  Much love!

I'm happy I made it this far, but still a little annoyed that I'm still feeling some acute symptoms. I still have a bit of anxiety. It's not day 3 acute anxiety, but it is still noticeable and persistent. The anxiety tends to be the worst at night when I am trying to sleep and in the mornings. The insomnia still persists. I can sleep in 2-3 hour chunks at most before waking up and being unable to fall back asleep. Wim Hoff breathing has helped a bit in this regards and does help me fall back asleep some times. I must of done 4 full Wim Hoff breathing sessions throughout the night last night. 

I still feel cold, have teary eyed yawns, sneezing like crazy, lack of energy/motivation, little appetite...the usual. It tends to get better as the day goes on. 

While I am annoyed that I'm still feeling some acute symptoms, I am happy I made it this far. This is also a crucial point for me. My last few quits I ended up going back somewhere between 7 and 10 days, so it really just ended up being a tolerance break for me. I know if I took one of those disgusting shots right now it would feel like it did in the beginning again, but now I also know where it leads....every single time. I'm getting more of those thoughts, but now when they come, I think about the horrible taste, all the times I vomited that shit back up...I look in the mirror into my eyes and see how clear they are right now, and that if I take any K they will immediately be consumed by a hazy fog. I'm done romanticizing the shit. I need to fully heal. 

I'm at a crucial point right now and know I cannot go back. Future me will either be proud my actions over the next several days/weeks, or will weep with despair. I want to make future me happy. I wish all other quitters the best of luck. We can beat this.",16

I still don't quite understand how I managed to get through some of those days, but it only goes to show that we're much stronger than we think we are. After another year of usage at 20+ gpd, this time was definitely one of the most difficult to quit, and I can imagine that with each additional relapse and the fact that I'm not getting any younger I don't have any desire to go through another withdrawal from anything. 
Now I have to get back to work, my wife, my passions, my life. I don't have the luxury to sit around on my ass and watch the life pass me by. I'm tired of ""waking up"" a year or two older, thinking wtf happened?

If I can cut down to 1-2 level tablespoons a day, will that help my cognition and would it help the withdrawal not be so horrible?

I just want to know if I'm waiting my time if I successfully dedicate to this dose reduction and should just go to rehab asap or if it will actually help me when I do quit CT.

I live in Germany and kratom is legal here but Illegal in Switzerland. So if I want to go there I have to quit. I have about 9days Till I have to leave. Next week I have thursday -Sunday off work so I guess I could try to go CT.

However, it didn't stop the Hellish w/d. We spent a week sitting at the dining table, playing video games, and barely speaking to each other. His come down was far more rough than mine, as his gpd was a min of 50ish... and that's low-balling it.

The first week, we were useless people. Bare minimum got done, and I'd argue that it was less than the bare minimum for some of those days. Heading into the second week, we were both feeling our minds in our heads in a way that was disturbing. Like, shit, hearing yourself think? Actually *think*? It was turbulent, and we pulled through. I'm slightly surprised, and beyond proud of him.I'm so fucking proud of him.

It's surreal to feel as though I've been on autopilot for years; no rational thoughts, no genuine feeling in almost all actions.. just absent. I feel like I've just been absent. It's easier to laugh now. It's easier to joke and be childish and goof around. I'm less anxious- which, I never saw coming. Not for a moment.

I had no idea what kratom was when I walked into a smoke shop last August to buy cbd vape juice. I asked the shop owner what  kratom is and he gave me a little sample pack. That first time euphoria was amazing and was never really duplicated. For the last 6-7 months I was killing about a kilo monthly.   


I've been sober from alcohol for 3 1/2 yrs and moved on to cbd which had me feeling fine. I'm currently on a resort in the Mariana Islands in a quarantine so I knew there was no way I could run to the smoke shop when the withdrawal begins. It's day 2 and the hot flashes in my lower back and stomach area have wained down. Yesterday I could not focus and was emotionally sensitive to any thought and memory. I was rolling in bed countless times unable to be still from the heat in belly and lower back.

I thought I‚Äôd share a trick that worked wonders for me tapering. We all know we lack self control which is what got us in to this mess I‚Äôve tried making a plan and using capsules trying to taper and it never worked for me. I always would take extra or take more than I was supposed this defeating the purpose of the taper. 

I bought a ‚Äúkitchen safe‚Äù a time locking container that I have been putting my Kratom in and increasing the hours that I would lock it up for. Started worth 2 hrs eventually got to 6, 12 etc. I noticed some of my problems go away like my allergic reaction to alcohol and the constant need to worry about if I‚Äôm going to take my kratom before I go out or take it with me. I completely forgot about it! Obviously I would start to really feel my energy hit a wall but I knew that meant progress was happening. I knew that meant I would be able to go more hours the next day. 

If it sounds drastic it kind of is. It‚Äôs not a perfect taper where you slowly reduce the amount for 6 months or you won‚Äôt notice any uncomfortable feelings. 

I don‚Äôt have that much time to spend on tapering I think I‚Äôm having auto immune issues being caused by kratom. Alopecia areata and hearing loss.  I have a silver dollar patch of hair missing on my head. It‚Äôs very noticeable so I wear a hat now. I have a constant ringing in my ears and they were frequently just turning off like a bomb when off. I watched the sound of metal last night and it freaked me out enough to go ct and just suffer through it. I don‚Äôt want to go deaf because of this garbage.

I only took 1, only one, dose on Monday night (3 days ago) and it was 0.75mg. Then I woke up and read about how bad it can be with benzo wd, and decided to not use it anymore. 

I phoned my psych and instead he prescribed hydroxydine. It is an antihistamine that has anti-anxiety and drowsy properties. They give it to people before and after surgery apparently to relax them. It is not habit forming and safe. He said I can use 1 or 2 pills at bedtime every night if I feel like I need it. 

Has anyone used hydroxydine before? If so, did it work for you? 

Also, I am not going to have any wd from that 1 dose of klonopin, do I? Please reassured me, because I'm constantly worried about ws from klonopin now.

The majority of my days are great. I have a new job, I‚Äôm being productive, I‚Äôm seeing friends and being social again. I do have random bouts of what I‚Äôm attributing to PAWS. This is my first experience with addiction and those first several weeks I felt negative emotions I‚Äôd never felt before. Those same feelings come back sparingly for a few hours at a time, so I feel confident they are WD related and over the coming months they‚Äôll continue to lighten up. I would say fatigue still hits me more than anything else I‚Äôve noticed. I‚Äôll fucking take it; things are so much better now than they were even just a month ago.

I‚Äôve been watching the handmaids tale, new episodes and old to refresh. And in season one there‚Äôs a scene where the girls are cleaning off the wall that previously had bodies hanging from it. And Janine says something like ‚Äúit looks weird without the dead bodies doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù And someone agrees and then she says ‚ÄúI guess you get used to things being one way.‚Äù And my mind took this and ran with it. 

It‚Äôs true. The brain is nuts. A lot of the time people don‚Äôt like or want to change to start, but in time we develop and newness becomes the norm. In this example these girls got used to walking by frickin hanging bodies. We adapt and adjust and oftentimes surprise ourselves. I could not have pictured my day-to-day not including regular dumps of kratom into my mouth every few hours. I was resistant and stubborn and full of dread. And while I still think of it from time to time (reflection on use, not tempted to use) I can feel my life without it becoming my new norm. And it kind of makes you wonder how high you can raise whatever ‚Äúnorm‚Äù you are living in these days. Getting started is the hardest part but the sky‚Äôs the limit. 

My hair shedding has lightened significantly. I‚Äôve noticed this in the last week more than anything. I used to dread showering because of the collection of hair I‚Äôd acquire in my hands but now I am starting to look forward to it to see how much things are improving. I do have baby hairs coming in but it‚Äôs not been nearly enough time to see any sort of real improvement. With many quoting the hair cycle at three months, I am starting the clock on my hair repair journey today. Hopefully within the next year I‚Äôll be able to post good things to provide hope for so many of us dealing with this issue.

This quit is going AWESOME and im so happy. I used kratom occasionally as a pre workout through 2018 and 2019. But during 2020 I spiraled into full blown addiction. Due to the pandemic i had all sorts of shortfalls that kratom helped me cover. At my worst I was consuming 100-150 GPD. This is my 5th quit. For me the easy part was always the acute withdrawals. It was the longer term PAWS that would cause me to relapse. Id make it two or three months and then go right back to constant consumption because I just never felt right without it. I got this sorta puritanical belief for whatever reason that I should be able to just raw dog reality with zero exogenous substances. No caffeine no kratom no cbd no alcohol, nothing. Just my endogenous neurotransmitters. Thats somthing I've tried to achieve numerous times in my life, and it never works. So after my last relapse I came to a realization. I need a chemical bandaid. Im stuck on kratom because it works to treat my issues. But it comes with serious downsides. So as long as I definitely need some sort of medication, I might as well explore all my options and see if I can find somthing with a better pro/con ratio. I started working with a psychiatrist and discovered I've had undiagnosed ADHD my entire life. And that I was using kratom (specifically white kratom, ive never cared for the other strains) to self medicate that. During the shutdown I was just trying to numb my pain but through that I discovered it helps treat my disorder, and thats when I really spiraled with it. Doc put me on wellbutrin, a selective dopamine / norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Bassically an anti depressant with stimulant properties that can help ADHD but has way less abuse potential than focus pills. And lomotragine, a mood stabilizer. And holy shit you guys, this is the first quit I've ever had where I actually feel fine without kratom. Im hopefully this is going to be the time it finally sticks. Medication is just one component of my recovery obviously. Its still substantially about lifestyle changes and reconnection. But figuring out what my underlying issues are and how to more effectively treat them has made a world of difference. 

Im sharing my story because im hoping it might help some of you guys out. I think its very much worth examining why you are using kratom. Pursuing psychological testing and or diagnosis. And figuring out an alternative way to mend that wound. That could be therapy, or lifestyle changes, or medication. But if you are using kratom to put out a fire, and you remove the kratom, the fire is only going to get bigger. You can't really succeed until you snuff out the fire first. It took a brutal year of on again off again addiction to this disgusting green sludge to finally realize and accept this. Im hoping you can learn from me and save yourselves some trouble.",33

I have been doing it the stupid way, though, and not measuring and I feel I've been making too little 'Progress'. Ordered a ton of supplements and have been waiting on them to get here to really start attacking this thing.

I know (and have heard many others say this, too) that working out/regular exercise helps tremendously. I used to hit the gym on the regular, but once opioids and other bullshit (Kratom included) started creeping into my life about 6 years ago, I hardly ever went. REALLY wanting to start getting into that hardcore again, too. The hardest part is just getting started and back into that mindset again after being a flake for so long. I know once I start, I'll be off to the races, it's just that mental aspect that seems to get me more than anything. 

You know what I mean...the voice in the back of your head that says ""why bother at this point, there's no hope, it won't work, etc..."". All I know is, I simply cannot be on the K train any longer and am SO worn out of being a substance hound. Have been through a hellride for years with all kinds of drugs, and just want to wake up feeling 'normal', mentally and physically. Tired of feeling dependent on something to get through the day. It's simply ridiculous. 

Anyway, planning on jumping VERY soon once I receive the rest of my supplements. So, wish me luck and please lend any advice if desired. Cheers you wonderful folks :)",4

If each extract shot is 14g, as I have heard, then I estimate my daily intake to be around 70g. The cold turkey from this will be unbearabe, however I might have to suffer through it due to me being an addict at heart and I am not sure a taper would work. Any advice or experiences from someone quitting extracts and/or dosages as high as mine? Also, has anyone experienced adverse heart issues or severe anxiety as a consequence of kratom intake being this high? I have seen a few scientific studies that suggest Kratom can cause heart problems, however they don't seem to be common or severe. I haven't seen any reports of people dying solely from Kratom without some other underlying health problem. Anyway, can anyone here provide me with any experiences or advice on coming off of a kratom dosage this high, besides what is already in the sticky?

First post here, but I have been lurking quite a bit for the past few days.  I am going on a trip in July to a place where Kratom is illegal, so it is time to make the jump!  When I realized it is illegal where I am going, I actually had a rush of excitement because that meant I no longer had an excuse to put off the quit.

No idea how much I was taking, but probably an average of 20 gpd, and definitely trending upward the past few weeks.  Originally used it as a great preworkout/stimulant, and then of course that turned into using it nonstop throughout the day just to not feel like crap. Luckily I never developed a habit of using it to go to sleep, but I used it like crazy during the day!

Sunday I used 9 grams, Monday I used 6, yesterday 2, and today 2 (so far).  My plan was to stick with 6-8 gpd all week, and drop down next week, but so far I am functioning, so no reason to take more if I do not need to.   Last night I had these crazy cramps in my stomach throughout the night, and it definitely made it tough to sleep.  Besides that, no crazy symptoms so far besides the massive fatigue, but I was pretty tired all the time with K anyways, so at least now I am tired with a more clear head, ha.

Anyways, I just want to say it has been good reading everyone's posts the last few days, and seeing how everyone is managing.  I have never used any mainstream addictive drugs before, so have not had to deal with something like this.

Also, if I have any recommendation for people going through WD, it would be to force yourself to do something, even if it is just going for a light walk.  When I am laying on the couch it feels impossible to do anything with the physical WD, but as soon as I actually start to exercise or do something else productive, it really is not bad, and it helps take my mind off everything!

I started my taper back in February of this year. I finally got down to 9.25 gpd.

I would only have to go to work and take care of myself. This really was an unexpected gift that I‚Äôve been given.

The only problem is, I won‚Äôt be finished with my slow taper in two weeks. My mind is telling me, practically begging me to jump off this shit as soon as she gets on that plane. I want this done, I want to be a happier mom when she comes home.

As of about 30 minutes ago, my mind shifted to a positive mood and attitude. I don't understand this. Is this the first glimmer of the sober life?

Extremely helpful and supportive.  I'm not sure if I'm an addict but I was certainly physically dependent on this stuff.  40gpd, sometimes more for over a year, strong stuff too.  Stopped 5 days ago CT after a month taper down to 10gpd.

Physical symptoms are mostly gone, except I still can't sleep past 4am, I'm not sure if this is related, I work a very stressful ""elite"" cybersecurity job and it's been wild the last month, beyond the norm even.  Brain fog because of the lack of sleep (I think) is still there, but definitely improving.  The taper was brutal, but it made it easier in the end.

I stopped because of lack of sleep and hypertension.  This stuff spiked my BP like you wouldn't believe.  Massive adrenaline and norephedrine symptoms.  BP down significantly on day 4.  Didn't matter the strains/types/extracts, I've done them all.  It also became useless for anxiety and started to remove my emotional capability, even sex drive.    

I started because of cracked floating ribs (I play a lot of sports and hike/climb a lot), and I didn't want to keep renewing the Percocet or Vicodin scripts.  I noticed the Kratom worked just as well without the loopy feeling.  I stopped when ribs were healed, I then tore my calf muscle off my leg, and used it for this too, followed by tearing my MCL a few months later.  I then noticed it basically eliminated anxiety (see stressful job).  That was all she wrote, all day every day.

You guys really helped me with your positive posts and comments and your experiences of things that help during withdrawal. I want to share the top things that really helped me.   
I don¬¥t know if I have to write that I¬¥m not a doctor and that this is not medical advice so I just do it to be sure.

1. Prayer helped me with everything especially with the cravings.
2. Water with a freshly squeezed ripe lemon and about a gram of Vitamin C helped with all the flu-like-symptoms especially with the cold chills.
3. Hot Showers helped me with the chills, the RLS and the general feeling of not beeing clean.
4. Iboga root bark helped tremendously with the cravings, the depression and the hopelessness. 
5. Excercise like going for a long walk helped with the RLS, the anxiety and the depression.

Right now I feel like I can do this. I hope that this is the last time that I have to go through this hell and I wish you guys all the best!

I tried tapering and I know I cant do CT by myself. I live alone and live a pretty sedatary lifestyle. Mostly due to covid and school. I been taking Kratom for 2 1/2 years and I just kept ramping up my dosage. Im at 42 to 50 gpd. I was at 36 but shit happened 2 weeks ago and I jumped back up. Anyway... I cant let anyone know about my addiction and I am checking into a detox facility next week. Doing my prescreening this friday. I am not physically healthy and Kratom is killing me and I know it.

I am fearful, soo much soo, last 2 days my emotions have been all over. Like random different feelings and thoughts. Mostly fear and worry. I am horrified about what I will experience, I am scared I will want to killmyself from the entire ordeal. Worried I wont make it through the acutes at the detox center. Worried about how I will feel. Depression, anger, anhedonia. I did quit opiates in the past. Like 2013. Its seems so long ago. I am just afraid this will be much worse and last longer. I am sticking with the ct and quit because I dont see any other way out. I have too much on the line.

I keep reading stories on here and they just fill me with fear. Wish I read them before I even started the shit, would have kept me wayy the hell away...  (last night while trying to sleep I kept falling asleep I kept having these weird dream like things I was opened a reddit post on how someones quit made was just so bad and all the fucked up shit. I know it everyones different and different quits can be different. Im just so fearful.)

I know I will be given comfort meds and stuff at the detox and be made to do stuff which is 100x better than at home. I just dont know whats in store and I am afraid how bad ill come out of this. 

I also dont know what else I should do or ask for the detox for when it comes.

Cravings. Cravings. Kravings. 
Cravings, (booze), kravings,
KrayKray Kratom Cravings.


Did you notice one of those things not being like the other? Sigh. To be honest they are not even REAL cravings like ""omg might break, sweating over here"" half the time. They are just the intrusive thoughts of ""this would make today a little better"". Or would help ""get through the boring day"". Bad girl. As a 10 year recovering alcoholic, the booze cues are all to familiar for me. I still get an alcohol craving from time to time, and I DID expect it during this quit, as I got a craving for it last quit, so last night it happened and I wanted either Kratom or booze, just something to take the edge of off a long day. 

I am trying to get myself to ""sit with the feeling of boredem"" for a bit before I try to do something about it. (Ex: before changing to a new task when I should be finishing one thing, before grabbing my phone, etc.) 

As someone who has been in the recovery game for a while, but is literally learning something new all the time, I'm curious what your method of dealing with cravings are?",6

So I've mastered the acute withdrawals numerous times now only to fold somewhere between 14-40 days, when the initial pain fades and my mind starts telling me it's okay we can moderate this time, I push back and shut it down asap but when the internal argument rages on and I get overwhelmed by some normal human emotions that I've somehow unlearned how to deal with or I just get a really shitty day when I'm tired, work and kids are stressing me out I hit the 'fuck it' button and usually binge for days which lands me right back in the shit.

I badly need the strength to push through this any advice would be welcomed (books, meditations etc)? I was also thinking maybe some therapy and upping my dailly does of SSRI (paxil) has anyone got through it like that? I do exercise as much as the fatigue will allow and try to eat healthy but sometimes I binge on crappy foods and it tends to temporarily relieve my urges.

Basically any help or advice would be so helpful, I don't post alot but you guys on this forum have helped me so much, I feel like this is the final hurdle if I could just see it to 90 days my brain and body would level off.

I just wanted to throw this out there because the support I have received from this thread has really helped me in the past.  I am totally addicted to Kratom and it is slowly bringing me down and tearing my life apart (AGAIN).  I quit CT around 8 months ago from a two year 50-60 GPD.  The quit was really hard and didn't feel anything good until like my 5th day.  My endorphins slowly started to shoot naturally.  It was hard tho.  It took about 3 months to actually feel somewhat normal.  But being an addict that I am, I relapsed 3 months ago and have been using anywhere from 5 to 40 GPD.  Ive tried to taper down but it doesn't work for me.  I am an all or none type of person.  I am afraid to quit fearing the mental anguish associated with withdrawing from Kratom.  But I know that I have to stop this now before I lose everything.

If anybody has any advice for me to help the quit this time, I would really appreciate it.  Im talking about any supplements OTC, or anything for that matter.  I know that exercise and sleep are key.  I have sleep aids so Im not too worried about that.  Its just the grind of getting through the day and performing at my job.

And others still that say they turn a pretty big corner AFTER 30 days. And I am here to say I GET it. This is by far the most anxiety I have had since I quit. Actually, I feel like the first few days after I quit were better than today and yesterday.

But I am wondering if that's the natural progression of healing off of this stuff, ya know? We quit, and we feel terrible with acutes (\*not so bad for me since I tapered for so long) and then after the acutes we are so glad to have stuck it out, and feel so happy to have beat the green sludge. And then now at 30 days, acutes are gone, the newness of being off of kratom is gone, and reality sets in, like this is IT. Each day is not a new day for me, this is as good as it gets. But I made decisions to set myself up for the life I have, just the same as I made decisions to involve kratom in it for so many years. I stand by my decision to take kratom in the first place (\*wondering why I kept doing it when it stopped working), I mean that's just a part of who I am. And I very much stand by my decision to quit. These are hard times for me PAWS-wise, at least that's the only thing that I can think of that's happening. But whatever lack of identity I stuck with pre-kratom and during kratom use, it's not that bad off the powder...it's really just the same.

I say I get the urge to use again, but that's not to say I'm going to go back to kratom. I still have like $300 worth in my cabinet I'm going to give to my friend that I haven't touched (with words of caution). I know if I took say 5 grams right now I would feel fantastic. But it wouldn't be the same. Because it's a lie, and I can't sit there and feel great knowing it's not because I did it to myself organically without drugs and it won't stay unless I take more. Having it in the cabinet should make me feel like a champion for having it so close and not taking it. But honestly kratom is so far from my mind, I forget it's even in there most days. THAT'S the biggest win for me so far. I want to get to a point where when I feel shitty my instinct isn't to immediately think it's because of kratom. I just want to forget about the plant altogether, and I think I am getting there :)

So here's to infinity more months without the sludge and hoping it gets better from here!",40

I've since switched to 0.07g capsules and take about 7-10g/day now, never exceeding 3.5g at any given time.  All green bali.  I am also a heavy energy drink consumer. I drink the blue sugar free low carb monsters.. When I first started they complemented each other nicely. 

All of that leads me here. Anytime I take kratom now, I'm extremely tired. I've begun to get dizzy. Worst of all, I have this weird pressure on the top of my head that feels like something is gonna burst. It is so bad at times that I involuntarily shake my head from side to side. I am curious if this is related to kratom? I am starting to get freaked out, thinking I have an brain anyersm or something.  Right now I am in a horrible state, being addicted to kratom and caffeine.

My plan is to go full CT because I just can't seem to taper properly. I also just think, might as well rip the bandaid off fast rather than slow. I have a bunch of stuff I'm in the middle of right now, making a life transition into a new career, moving to a new city, have to be the best man at a wedding, and have to learn a new career skill... all over the course of the next couple months. I know this sounds like a terrible time to give this a go... but I actually think staying busy might be the best thing for me.

So my plan is to start today... but I wanted to know your recommendations in terms of what to take for the worst part of the detox. I was thinking about getting some Kava to help with the anxiety and sleep... is this a bad idea? I already take melatonin, and cbd at night for sleep as is... so perhaps I just increase my dose on those? Any other recommendations on what to take would be extremely helpful!

I'm on about 25 - 35 grams a day... and that has actually been cut back quite a bit due to a stomach bug i had.

Wish me luck guys, I can only afford to really give myself a week before things get extremely busy. I'm very nervous about this... but I have to power through and just do what needs to be done. Thanks for your support, wouldn't be able to do this without you guys!",5

Everything is looking good over here today but I am struggling with just wanting to go CT at this point (just an addict way of thinking) 

I have been super successful with my taper thus far. I went from 35-40 gpd to now sitting pretty at a solid 9.5 gpd and still dropping. I have not had urges to use more or cheat my doses even when I experience withdrawal symptoms from my weekly cut. I actually smile to myself when I experience these symptoms because I know I‚Äôm kicking ass and doing what needs to be done. I don‚Äôt intend on coming out of my taper completely unscathed.

So my question is, does slow and steady really win the race? I feel like I am better off sticking to my schedule now and riding this taper out until I hit 3.5-5 gpd and then jumping.

anyway, I had an issue with my last shipment as I was running low and absolutely lost my mind last night when I found out. after calming down I realized that was some crazy addict behavior and figure maybe it's a sign, I've known I should probably quit anyway since I'm going to be starting a new job soon and kratom-addicted me is probably a bad employee.

I've thought about tapering but that's failed pretty badly for me in the past due to lack of self control, so I feel like the only way is to just quit cold turkey.

Thanks to this group Ive made it to day 11ct, 7hrs will be my day 12. Thank you all for yr help. You guys gave me strength in my darkest hours. 

Wanted to brainstorm my plans for next few weeks. 
If yall have anything to add please do. 

Im a 30ish yr old woman, Ive deducted 1 year of my age due to covid. The lockdown bday dont count. (Joking ) Im a regular weight lifter, dry sauna, ice bath/shower goer, 100% organic grass fed meats / diet regular. So my plan to heal post acutes starts with those above staples for me. Ive recently healed an acute neck injury @ top stem cell docs here in USA. Thats what allowed me to CT off green sludge. Two huge monkeys off my back are gone! Greatful. 
My job is federally licensed, we are not allowed narcotics & are checked every 2 years for medical clearance & they check pharmacy databases. So no narcotics allowed for me as usual. Not that I would anyway, been there done that. Got the tee shirt & the postcard. Lol. 
I slept two nights in a row, rls last night was only a 1 thankfully last night. I did my first weight lifting session yesterday. Huge progress! Going to do dry sauna today + 2 cold showers. & Maybe another 30 min legs to tire out my body. Got another deep tissue massage today. (I shoudlve started them earlier in acute phase) but massage helps w/ endorphins so. Todays massage wasnt nearly as pain relieving as the last. Thats prob a good thing though at least Im outta acutes. Im trying to release natural endorphins. Music. Mediation. Both are reg staples of mine too. I also have organic 100% cacao sugar free, been having a few pieces daily. 
What else are yall doing to heal? I have 0 cravings. I hate the green sludge & will never do this again. 
Trying to make sure Ive got good plans going forward to heal. Im going back to work soon & I have to start prepping for my state exams. Forgot to mention, Im a vit D regular every other day @ beach or pool (20 min for vit d exposure) My last bloodwork was amazing this past January. My testosterone was very high for a female (thanks to my diet), my vit D was a high 74! I guess Im lucky the green sludge didnt hit my hormones like others. Wonder what they are now though. Brain fog is def gone, not up to studying just yet though. 
Anyone running something thats really helping? 
How are yall planning to fight post acute phase (paws or not). What physical or therapies do yall recommend? Thanks in advance.

On weekends I dose in the morning then several hours later, after that tiny buzz has long worn off, I go to the gym and get a better workout than I would have gotten faded on kratom. I go out to dinner without a pocketful of capsules and don‚Äôt freak out because I‚Äôve been away from my stash for too long. 

This past weekend, after noticing I was able to sleep in late and not feel wd upon waking, I decided to see if I could get by with only 2 doses instead of 3. Sunday was easy and Monday was doable as I was working from home, but I wasn‚Äôt sure I could pull off on a day that I‚Äôm in the field. Today, I woke up at 6, had coffee and whatnot, drove to the site, took some notes, made 2 phone calls, and then, at 10 fricken o‚Äôclock, had my first dose. Amazing.

You might remember me from 2020, as the guy who would rack up 6, 10, even 25 (once) days clean from kratom before relapsing and restarting the clock. I quit 1-3 times a month after deciding to quit. I didn't give up, and if finally paid off. 

I'm so proud to say I've finally hit 4 months without kratom or any opioids! It was hard, but past that 40 day mark for me, cravings just dropped off significantly. Once the night sweats stopped and I could sleep on my own, once my mood was stable throughout the day again, it's been easier.

I'm no expert, but my advice to anyone struggling making it through the first couple months is to go to some supportive meetings, or even an IOP or rehab. And don't do other drugs or drink for a while (as I learned the hard way). For me, it took rehab and vivitrol to get me through the first month of intense drug (including others) cravings, and then going to AA/SMART/dharma recovery meetings many/most days to keep me motivated, supported, and to ensure passing thoughts and cravings didn't take hold and cause relapse. I think community was the key for me after that first month, and it's something I'm going to make sure my life always has. 

But holy shit y'all life is so much better! ""In recovery you can do ANYTHING you want, except drugs!"" It's very freeing. I feel like an island of stability in the world now, content as I move through it. Whereever I go, I feel safe and calm. Weird af, but it's how I'd describe my experience.

Final thought: when I was going off and on kratom, I thought I had anxiety and that's why I was using it. After a couple months clean, the anxiety went away almost completely. My psych said opioids can cause mental illness in otherwise healthy people. Even if you struggle with mental illness, you'll feel so much better in a couple months.

Not to say I don't have hella work on myself left to do! Full disclosure, I relapsed on phenibut for 4 days about a month it. so I have 77 days fully clean! Good luck all",14

I swear it feels like this stuff gave me arthritis, which is sort of alarming seeing as how I'm in my late 20s...

 I have good days and bad days with my mood. Some days I wake up with actual panic symptoms ie shortness of breath, chest tight, increased heart rate. Other days I wake up in an excellent mood. Then some days I legit get annoyed by everyone around me. 

My alcohol intake has increased, which I know is stupid, but some days I just need a reprieve from the anxiety and bad mood. Cannabis helps some days, then other days it makes me more anxious.

My heart rate is still high intermittently. Sometimes I'll panic about something, and my heart rate will stay above 120 for a long time. Longer than I'm comfortable with. Which then makes my anxiety worse. But I know this is common with withdrawals. Exercise definitely helps with this.

I think this is my first post on this sub after lurking for a while, seeing if other people have the weird symptoms that I have lol you guys have been a tremendous help in making me realize that I don't have cancer or something and it's just the green goblin fuckin with my body. Can't wait to see what this next 30 days has in store! Yall keep grinding!!",39

My case is a bit unusual I think in that I didn't get very sick at first when I quit. I would have bad periods and then they will pass and I will have good ones. I could sleep most days. The last 3 days or so things changed. I cannot sleep, my heart rate is super high, im sweating and flushed, I feel like my skin is crawling and every muscle and joint in my body ache. I was able to get 6 hours of sleep this night on klonopin from my psych, but klonopin doesn't really address other issues besides sleep. Im dysfunctional and it seems to be getting worse. I can't have that. 

So I decided to seek professional help. I haven't been addicted to anything before so I don't know how things work and I don't have time or patience to look around for days. I decided to go to my local ER and seek help from someone who knows addiction. Is this a good move? I just need to talk to someone and get a professional opinion on where I am and what to come. I really wish I would have asked my psych for clonidine, maybe I will ask them that. What do you think will happen next? Will they send me home or commit me to the hospital? I'm not suicidal or anything like that. I just need relief from this constant stuff I mentioned before. Thank you guys for listening and any input will be appreciated!",13

Really wanted to get high today. Got in huge fight with wife. We‚Äôve been through this so many times. Debilitating withdrawal and relapse at least 10 times. I always go behind her back and get high again. She said this is the last time and she is done if I relapse. I don‚Äôt blame her I guess. 

Withdrawal has been incapacitating as usual. I am incapable of working or any effort more than a few seconds. I get tired just sitting down. I feel permanently damaged. 

Just to clarify, I am NOT using ‚Äúcomfort meds‚Äù. I don‚Äôt believe that works for an addict. We must suffer unbearably so that we never forget. If it was easy to stop taking opiates, I wouldn‚Äôt be typing this. 

I‚Äôm not drinking alcohol. No nicotine. I just stopped everything. Overwhelming restlessness.

Someone please remind me this will improve. My logical mind knows it will. But I am such a manipulative fucker and can easily convince myself the sky is purple even when it‚Äôs blue. I hope you understand. 

We are still short rent money but Amazon hired me and so should start soon. We will get health benefits and I can start seeing a therapist for my mental health issues. 

I don‚Äôt need help right now, I just need a hug. I have been so isolated for so long and I feel half a human in this mess.

Something to consider: When you go to the gym and lift weights.. it hurts. Your muscles burn and then you become sore the next day.

Edit: I should add that I smoke Delta 8, as well as take the gummies, for anxiety. I recently ordered something for my horrible memory which turns out to be very calming as well. Took a look at the ingredients and it's 1,000mcg of lithium orotate, which turns out can be used to treat several mood disorders.

After tapering down from 15 teaspoons a day, to just under 2 (35 day process), I opted to let it go completely. After reading several sites and individuals‚Äô experiences with withdrawals, I figured the WD timeline to be anywhere from 7-10 days; boy was I in for a surprise. Currently sitting on day 22, I still feel symptoms, and cannot sleep without CBD due to RLS. The constant discomfort seems to only get very, very mildly better each day. Sometimes not even  noticeable, I have to remind myself how I felt 7 days prior to give any sense of actual progression. I never would have thought this process could take upwards of a month of actual  physical withdrawal, but hoping to be 100% soon. 

Being an athlete, eating well, and never having an addiction prior to this, I 100% wish I had never started taking kratom. The addiction is absolutely not the equivalent of coffee, tea, etc., as so many sites have tried to explain. I know everyone responds differently, but again, as someone who has never taken any drugs, this process has been hell.

Just figured I‚Äôd give my experience, for anyone that may be in the early or middle stages of withdrawal, thinking there is no end in sight. I certainly feel millions of times better than I did days 1-4, but just be prepared for a somewhat long road; at least for those of you who have taken it for years. 

Looking forward to being my old self soon.",27

Maybe I'm wrong. But I dropped a 30-50 gpd habit of 4 years 10 days ago. It's been absolutely miserable. After maybe day 6, I started to feel better. It's been very minuscule improvements, but they're happening. Since I quit, I slept one time prior to last night. That was on day 4, I couldnt take the insomnia so I said fuck it and got a fifth of vodka, slammed the whole thing, because I knew that would at least knock me out for a few hours. It did, but then I got to enjoy the misery of a hangover along with the misery of strong withdrawals. Well, last night, I took some chamomile tea, and took a unisom at about 9pm. Laid in the dark for 2 hours, wasn't even the slightest bit able to sleep (although I was tired as FUCK. Was awake for just shy of 60 hours, zero exaggerations. That's the longest I've ever been awake in my 24 years of existence. My gf called me at around 11, we talked til about 2. I took a 3mg melatonin, laid down, next thing I knew, I was DREAMING. Actually dreaming. Woke up around 9am, tried to keep sleeping, got another 1 hour of sleep. It wasnt the best sleep I've had, but I know I was finally fully unconscious.

It gets easier. It really does. You just have to stick it out, embrace the misery, get used to it. I'm on day 10 now and I'm completely used to the fact that I'm going to be cold all day, my nerves are uber sensitive still, and I may not sleep tonight, but the fact that I finally got some really does show me how I truly am healing. We all are healing, as long as we stick to the path we've chosen. We all want off the horrible green swamp water for a reason, even if our brains want it back, our minds don't. The mind is the most powerful thing in the world, we just have to have the self discipline and willpower to stay clean.

Thanks for listening to my rambling. I hope I can give even just ONE person whose struggling see a glimpse of hope. It gets easier, I promise. I never in a million years thought I'd be on day 10. Kratom has consumed my life for the last 4 years, and I never even noticed it until I gave it up.",58

I cannot be in this nonstop anxiety and panic anymore and esp since I cannot sleep. Called my psych, in  tears, told him about going off kratom 3 weeks ago. I was so terrified but he wasn't concerned about kratom at all. He said I need to take clonopin before bed and during the day as needed for panic, and increase the dose of Prozac to 20mg. He didn't know if it was wd or not, and he did not care much. He knew what kratom was but he said that after 3 weeks wd should already have subsided. I was worried he would make wd a big deal but he didn't really care about it. 

So how does this plan sound? Clonopin to help with anxiety and to sleep, and an ssri to help in the long run? Will this work?

I have requested a week of annual leave which will give me 9 days to detox from both kratom and caffeine. I have decided to knock them both off at the same time. Writing this to develop accountability. It's lovely to meet you all too :) 

Has anyone else by chance tried quitting both kratom and caffeine CT at the same time? A lot of the withdrawals seem similar and I have read that kratom is in the same family as caffeine. 

I'm looking forward to stripping out these 2 substances and eventually moving on to tapering off beta-blockers and antidepressants. Eventually returning to the 'real me' and reacquainting myself with that person after all this time.",1

This has been my first time quitting kratom (and my last). i was taking 50+ gpd. or a bunch of extract capsules ,shots, and a shit ton of scoops for the past 10 months. Id take more and more each day searching for that special feeling. little did i know (or care to realize) but i started breaking out horribly, got incredibly skinny, had urinary problems and was an anxious mess due to kratom.

 This is not my first rodeo by any means, I'm 35 and started using at 18. I was in a car accident then was prescribed 4 30s a day which would only last a few days so turned to H, took suboxone for two years and man let me tell you that was a rough ride.

 It is now the end of day 6 and i felt like i needed to come here to tell others not to give up hope. Don't get me wrong i still feel subhuman due to lack of sleep and energy but every hour that passes I'm feeling better and better. Days 1,2,3,4,5 succcked. I felt like i wanted to jump out of my skin but couldn't muster the energy to do anything about it . cried a LOT, was peeing out my ass (still am but that's the most doable wd symptom in my opinion), stomach in knots, my spine felt like it was ripping apart from my muscles , and feels like there's air bubble in your joints, hot/freezing cold, heart pounding out of my chest yada yada... 

I've never taken supplements to quit anything before but this time i loaded up. magnesium, ashwaghanda, liposomal vitamin c , black seed oil, a b complex and a D. I found the vitamin c and the black seed oil the most helpful even if it was in my mind. I saw someone on here mention hot showers followed by the coldest water you can take , it helps wake you up instead of add to the already sluggish state. coconut water and Pedialyte were also huge. but the most helpful thing of all. don't lay around!! the first few days yeah i get it, it feels like there is no hope. day 3 i was forcing myself to get out of bed and do 5 dishes then have a break, but after that force yourself up as much as you can, sit in the sun, go for a walk , listen to music. 

Every day until now all i could think about was a few scoops just to get feeling okay again, not today buddy. my skin has already started clearing up, I can see colors more vividly, my urinary issue is subsiding, and my body is feeling ...pretty good compared to the last few days, im beginning to feel like me again. I,m hoping to get more than a couple hours of sleep tonight but if not, oh well, it will come in time. 

If your thinking about hoping off the k train do it, I have faith in you. Upwards and onwards my friends",19

I was planning on taper down from my dose (15-20gpd/min. 8 months), but I have only a month to do so (then I am travelling to another country), so I decided to quit CT right away. I think my LSD trip the day I decided to quit helped me to stay mentally stable even during first days of wd - although I dont recommend anyone taking psychedelics, if you are not sure you can use them for your wellbeing.

Withdrawals were so far managable, even though most of the time I could not get myself to do any work to school or job (I am computer science student and sitting doesnt help me, so I am cleaning my house instead :D). Hot baths are helping and I am taking some supplements too (Vit C, Magnesium Glycinate, L-theanine, etc.). What concerns me the most is the unability to sleep well (I wake during the night like 5-10 times and I have troubles falling asleep again). I hope my sleep and energy will improve soon, as I need to be productive (finishing at university + freelance job for client). I do not eat much (almost anything) as I didnt feel hungry yet. I am taking a walk/run every evening.

Apart from fatigue, I am feeling good right now. I have this moments of pure euphoria ""I am doing this!"" and my self-confidence is improving too. I am starting to feeling myself and my emotions, even negative ones, that I am transforming to energy. 

It's 100% worth to quit, if you find yourself stuck in grey numbness of kratom. Thank you for all your support, if you have any personal tips what helped you combat problems with sleep and fatigue/tiredness, I would be glad to hear them. I was doing my own research, but nothing works so far for me (or at least I do not see it). Have a nice day! :)",30

Sometimes I can feel my heart beating out of my chest. The morning are the absolute worse, but I tend to feel better as towards the end of the day. 

I had baby duty with my son. It is incredibly difficult to try and entertain a 17 month old when you have almost zero energy, but I pushed through. I think I got close to 2 hours of sleep twice last night for an estimate of four hours of sleep. The rest of the time I was tossing an turning. Again, to be expected. 

During the day my wife and I took my kid and the dog for a walk. I was forcing myself to do sprints with the dog to try and work up a sweat. I have the lead suit thing going on right now, so it took a lot just to get going, but I'm pushing through. I definitely think it helped just getting active and trying to something. I would say I feel better right now than I did at the same time last night, so that's progress. I'm sure I will feel like shit again tomorrow morning. Got to keep grinding I guess.

Decided to dose 3-6 grams of kratom (more or less close to the daily dose I was on last time) until it seemed like I was having extreme anxiety attacks , trouble breathing and back pain (though this was while tapering) I was in withdrawl long as fuck which blew my mind as I barely ever went over 9-10 grams ever while I did kratom. 

Skip past that and I had one of the most dissociated withdrawls I ever had in my life and swore off kratom until my trigger experience. I‚Äôve had so much time and had decent experiences moderating benzos so I figured I‚Äôd do some kratom. This worked out terrible because I ended up trying to ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù both for give or take 4-5 days continued use in what seems to be a black out. I used Kratom Valium and alp supposedly, most likely Flualp. 

Thru the black out I was manic as shit doing the most arguing with loved ones and being sneaky shady and I can remember specific moments of just terrible decisions like deciding to take another whole press the last night because I had done too much kratom and made myself feel too stimulated. So in my head Yea it‚Äôs time to stop doing drugs and go back to life. 

Withdrawal set in by day 2, and I was out of work all week. Honestly I posted about this on another sub thinking it was all benzo withdrawal but I‚Äôm jus starting to wonder, would a relapse on kratom typically give this quick kindling effect? I know I wasn‚Äôt doing a lot exactly but I never really did ‚Äúa lot‚Äù and still had withdrawals I would compare to a daily oxy 30 user at the very least. Starters with nausea and stomach ache turned into hot and cold flashes and insomnia and the WORST neck and back pain I‚Äôve ever felt.

The tricky part about quitting is the first few days are the hardest. In no particular order, here are some pointers to bear in mind during your journey:

&#x200B;

The important stuff:

1) Stay busy! Endlessly scrolling on your phone is dangerous territory; plan to make headway on something during your quit. (Read books, learn to code, practice yoga, etc - the possibilities are endless)

2) Engage in a community to help you stay strong. Here are some examples:

\----Go to NA meetings, online or in person.

\----Engage in an alternative program if NA isn't right for you. One example is Recovery Dharma.

\----Stay active on this subreddit and get in touch with fellow kratom quitters. Post regularly and comment on other's posts.

Feel free to mix and match to find what works best for you. I mostly go to Recovery Dharma meetings but also go to online NA meetings sometimes. If you've tried to quit several times unsuccessfully, consider getting a sponsor. Everybody is different, and every successful quit looks different.

3) Take it one day at a time. Have compassion for yourself. Tell yourself ""good job! "" every time you hit a milestone.

4) IMPORTANT: if you find yourself fantasizing about buying/taking kratom, take immediate action to end the craving as soon as possible. Here are some examples:

\---Strap on some tennis shoes and run around the block (or power walk, if you have bad knees like me)

\---Start organizing a messy room

\---Mow the lawn

\---Call a family member you haven't talked to in a while

\---Go to a meme website and make some hilarious memes.

The important part is to spring into action without delay. Do not sit there and entertain unhelpful thoughts.

5) This saved my ass many times: when a craving hits, verbally argue back with it. Get passionate! Tell your craving ""**No! Never!**"" or ""**I've come way too far for this. I do NOT have time for this horseshit**"". Treat the craving like a toddler having a tantrum. You are not your addiction, and you will finish what you started.

&#x200B;

During my active addiction there were many times when I thought I would never be able to quit. YOU CAN DO THIS. An addict is never as weak as they seem. ""There is no way to freedom except through the fire"".",26

So I've given myself quite the expensive Kratom habit and I'm ready to get my life back. I used Kratom to ward off side effects from chemo, as I am currently battling stage III cancer. Well chemo is over (for now) and I'd like to stop spending $80 a day on this crap. I was taking a boatload of capsules. At the highest point in February, I was taking around 450 capsules...a day..... How I can even swallow that many is absurd. I don't have access to gabapentin and other comfort meds at the moment. Otherwise, I'd just rip off the band-aid and go through it. 

Over the past two weeks, I've managed to taper down from 150 capsules 3 x a day to 120 capsules 3 x a day. I try to drop it down by 5 capsules every couple of days, and it's getting a little uncomfortable. My question is, should I  try  cutting these megadoses of capsules in half and add another dose or two to my day? So for example, instead of taking 120 damn capsules at once, maybe take 60 capsules 4 or 5 times a day and then cut from there? 

Also wondering, how many grams of Kratom are in a capsule usually?  I don't know how I got to this point other than chemo really sucked and I can self-medicate like no other. Yikes.",3

(If this is not allowed, please feel free to take it down)

In January 2021, I went to my hairdresser to see what she could do to save what was left of my hair. I‚Äôve always had very thick, long hair so I was really upset about what I‚Äôve done to myself. I asked her what I could do to help with the massive fallout and breakage I‚Äôve been experiencing and she gave me a CBD shampoo and conditioner that she and all of the other hairdressers use and swear by.

When I was using it for the first 3 weeks (was not tapering at all) it did absolutely nothing for me. At all. Then when I started my rapid to slow taper in February, I saw the results get better and better. It is now May and I managed to cut out 60% of my dose and my hair is thanking me and this stuff that I‚Äôm using. I‚Äôve had this stuff for 5 months now and I haven‚Äôt had to buy more yet.

It‚Äôs called Leaf & Flower Instant Damage Correction Shampoo & Conditioner (34 oz)

(OLAPLEX No 6 has also been an absolute godsend for breakage)

Disclaimer: I am not promoting this, this is just from my experience. I feel proud to be the lab rat for this lol This shampoo and conditioner is NOT a cure all. If you are not consistent with your taper or in withdrawals, this stuff will not work (I know from experience). I owe a lot of my hair loss improving to my taper but this stuff WILL help your hair stop falling out in chunks during these trying times. The CBD ingredient definitely is what makes it work. I brushed out about 5 hairs yesterday and I was over the fucking moon. I was so happy that I dropped my dose another .7 grams this morning.

I was using around 10-15gpd for about 3-4 years, sometimes up to 20 grams if I had a lot going on. I used it for pre-work out and the afternoon energy kick when I started dragging my ass. And then that turned into a daily set schedule around everything I was was doing, and then I found myself unable to function without it due to being completely miserable without it. So about 3 months ago I decided to just start taking less. I was taking about 5G, so I decided to just take 4 or 4.5G but never go back to 5. I did that for about a month and then  started reducing it by a half of a gram every week, and I wrote it down. I would start my taper on Saturday and take that reduced amount all week. After a couple months I was down to .5G two times a day, and then last week, nothing, zero Kratom! Aside from a little fatigue, mild runny nose off and and on, and a sweaty right foot, I made it through my first 7 days Kratom free, in a long long time and I feel pretty good.

Tried Lamictal IR, got near-instant results.","I'm a prolific kratom abuser (30+ grams/day) that has quit and relapsed several times over many, many years. Usually when I quit, the absolute worst symptom is uncontrollable restless legs and what can only be described as a never-ending dystonic reaction. It gets to the point where the torsion and twisting and jerking around makes me worry that I'm gonna break my neck or cause serious damage to my spine---muscular explosions just like hypnic jerks all over the body every 30 seconds, sometimes the opposite wherein I'm locked into the fetal position for hours at a time, unable to move or breathe like I'm in some kind of frozen cataleptic meat prison.

&#x200B;

(Look up opisthotonus, a painting depicting a tetanus patient. It's extremely similar to what happens to me.)

&#x200B;

Thing is, this time around I tried taking some of the Lamictal I had lying around (that I tried for 3 days while on kratom, but ultimately gave up on because I didn't give a fuck). Within 45 minutes I had virtually none of the above symptoms. I've been dosing 25mg every 3 hours with more or less the same results---doing this concurrent with about 60mg of Adderall a day, I basically have no withdrawal symptoms.

&#x200B;

What I'm wondering is how is this possible. Lamictal typically takes weeks to build up and present full relief from whatever is being treated. I'm positive that this isn't placebo: I've been relapsing over and over again for the past couple years because of these violent contractures not explainable by descriptors like ""restless legs."" Only thing I can think of is withdrawal seizures or a secret underlying epilepsy. Would highly prefer answers from people who like neurochemistry---I can't be assed to learn all that terminology on my own.",5

2021-05-01 20:38:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/n2veuk/last_time_was_easter/,Last time was Easter,"Last time I took Kratom was Easter. Warning this is not well written.

I looked at my hair in the mirror before going out to a movie with my kid's mom. Boy I was big shook. I could see my skull through my hair line. I know there are tons of reports of kratom affecting your hair. That was enough for me.

So after over two years on Kratom I quit cold turkey. I wasn't taking a lot. I had it cut down to 5 - 8 grams a day at the very most. Switching to the pills really helped with that especially considering I had no idea the pills were half the dose of a one gram scoop for a couple of months. :P

Day one of no Kratom sucked. I felt like I had 100 extra pounds on me. Everything hurt. Every muscle in my body. We went out to lunch. It was nice out. A rarity around this time a year in MN. We sat outside and I could barely sit up in my chair. The exhaustion was unbelievable. I went from being social (even pre kratom) to barely speaking a word. 

Day two their was a major family crisis in my kids mom's side of the family. So it was go go go again. I am a stander. I always stand, I pace, and I fidget. All I could do was look for a seat any chance I could. I could barely stand up. I remember this is when the chest racing started. That night I couldn't even sleep.

At that point after day two the physical muscle, movement, etc symptoms got better every day. I did myself a big service unintentionally tapering off. U wasn't 100% for probably two or three weeks. Maybe I'm not even 100% now. But I feel good. The big problem was the anxiety.

The anxiety was crushing. I had the paramedics out, a doctor visit, I went to the ER. I thought I was legitimately having a heart attack. That finally resolved itself maybe two weeks ago. That shit was crazy. All the doctors said it was just anxiety. After reading through people's experiences quitting here. I know it was the quitting kratom that caused that.

I don't even think I could put my quitting experience into words properly. It felt like I was between worlds. The world that everyone else is in and the world that I was in. Sure I never really took Kratom to get high. Some folks take 40 grams a day or more, thankfully that wasn't me. But I took it for that artificial energy boost. Something need doing? Sure fuck it pop a few pills or drink a nasty green energy drink kratom mixture and boom I'm at 100% energy.

I stopped taking it because of my hair. I realized all the other effects once I stopped taking it. God knows what it does to you long term. 

Oh and for those wondering. Your boys hair is back. I realized this a few days ago while in the shower. Shampooing my hair felt different, when I went to style it it felt and looked much better. It rebounded more quickly than I anticipated.",12

I know I'm out of the worst of it, but it's still going to be a long journey until I truly feel normal again. To the folks who are new, it does get better. It might take a long time, but it will get better. We have to remember why we chose to quit, to think about why that force was so strong it made us wish to drop something we believed only brought us good. This week truly has been one of the most life changing experiences for me. I'm currently unemployed, so I have spent pretty much the whole time locked in my room, occasionally leaving to try to exercise, or to see my gf. This is hard. This is really hard. I just want to sleep. I just want to not be cold. I want my body to feel normal again. I know it's coming, it's just so hard to look forward to, when you're this level of uncomfortable 24 hours a day, and you just know theres an INSTANT cure that will make me feel even better than I would before.

2021-05-01 12:41:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/n2m1zb/made_the_jump_last_dose_36_hours_ago/,Made the Jump - Last Dose 36 Hours ago,"I took my last dose at exactly 12am this Friday. The Friday prior to jumping, I slammed down some shots and got sick to my stomach. I was doing about 2 shots a day when taking my dog for a walk. I would skip a day or two with no shots sometimes, but I was also hitting the powder pretty hard as well. The shots had eventually become pretty ineffective at getting me that ""high"" that I craved so much, and wasting money on something that is no longer effective is pretty freaking stupid.

This week I've been on a pretty rapid taper. I first cut out the shots and stuck to powder, in which I was dosing about a plastic dixie spoon full 7-8 times a day. It took me just a couple of days to get it down to 4 doses a day...then a couple days later 3, then 2, then 1, then zero. I've pretty much been in withdrawal most of the week from the rapid taper with just brief periods of not feeling like shit when I took a dose. Due to the rapid taper, those doses rarely lasted more than a couple hours, then I was back in withdrawal as I tried to go as long as possible before I caved and took another dose. Actually, for the most part, I could still feel withdrawal symptoms while simultaneously feeling the effects of the kratom.

Now that I am 36 hours with out any Kratom, the withdrawal does indeed suck, but it's been manageable. I have a ton of helper meds I have been taking when the anxiety starts to flare up...pretty standard otc meds you hear about on here...magnesium, mega dosing vitamin C, BSO, L-Tryptophan, Passion Flower Extract, valerian root, DLPA,  Rhodiola rosea, L-Theanine, Vitamin D, Vitamin B Complex, Gaba (not gabapentin, OTC Gaba), and drinking lots of water. From my experience, when I have done a rapid taper like this, I feel like I get a lot of the mental acute symptoms out of the way while I am still dosing. Last night I was able to get a few hours of sleep after taking my stack of helper meds, but ended up waking up in a complete panic. I had one of those dreams where I was screaming to be woken up, then when I did, my heart was racing like crazy. I ended up taking more helper meds and fell asleep a few more hours, which absolutely would not have happened if I didn't do any type of taper.

I feel ok right now. Still a little anxiety, nose running, feel like I'm freezing cold, skin feels like I'm being pricked with pins and needles, lower back pain, dope tears, some diarhea, but I feel like I'm seeing some glimpses of my old self come out. I actually started getting those brief periods of lucidity while on my rapid taper. That's really what pushed me to make the jump once and for all. From my experience with past rapid tapers, I likely have a few more days in this state before the physical symptoms and the anxiety start to subside, then will come the crippling depression. I'm planning on going back to the gym real soon which should help a bit with the depression. I just have to force myself to go. I'm also guessing I will have broken sleep for about a month of more.

As you can probably tell, I have been through this rodeo before, which is why I need to stop once and for all. I convinced myself the last few quits that I could get a way with a kratom shot once in a while and manage it. Fucking stupid, I know. I need to be done with mind altering substances once and for all. I'm an addict. Always have been from a young age. Now I'm in my late 30's with a 1 year on son and a daughter on the way. I need to be the best father I can be. I can tell emotions are coming back because I'm crying typing this - well, probably more hyper emotional because I cried when my favorite NFL team drafted a player I really like, lol. Also, money has gotten really tight, partially because my addiction. Quitting all this BS should help matters. Hopefully, once all my helper meds run out, I wont need to pick up most of them anymore. 

I just wanted to post my experience and what I am currently going through right now. It helps to get it all out. I know many of you are going through hell right now, and some are scared to make that jump - I know I was for a while, but man, we can beat this thing. I plan to stick around this time. I know the cravings will eventually come full force, especially once I am free and clear of all withdrawal symptoms. That is when I will get thoughts that I can manage this thing again. When that happens, I will be right back on this subreddit.",14

I just recently tried tapering down but its hard. Ive ran out and don't want to get more. I don't want to, I don't want this anymore. But the thought of this withdrawal puts me in such a dark place, but I don't want my fiance to have to deal with it. I'm the only one that deserves this.

Im not gonna lie in scared. It's a nightmare but i NEED to do it. Im sick of it. Fuck kratom and Fuck my stupid addictive personality. I just wanna know if anyone has info on how long it may last for a daily user. I would say average 10-15 grams a day over an 18 hour period. Symptoms tend to start after 10-12 hours.

Should I taper?,"TLDR:  Just figured out kratom was messing up my sleep, and I've decided I want to quit. Should I taper or go CT? Should I dose before bed to keep withdrawals from messing w my sleep as much as possible? I've read vitamin c can help?

Heres my story, feel free to skip it if you're not interested: 

My guess is I use 20g a day, and have been for 6 years. For the past several months or more I was feeling tired all the time and I thought it was because my girlfriend was waking me up at night. I was looking forward to her going on a month long trip because I was feeling so tired and desperate to feel rested. Well, when she left my sleep didnt improve. I tried everything to get better sleep. Nothing worked. Yesterday, I thought ""hey maybe its the kratom being a stimulant."" 

 I stopped dosing way earlier than I normally do, hoping that I would sleep better. I did not lol. Before I went to bed I discovered you guys and read all about restless leg and insomnia from withdrawals at night, and how some ppl would dose in the middle of the night just so they could sleep. I read about how people felt tired all the time. I had no idea that people with a regular habit could get withdrawals at night. I thought withdrawals only happened if you stopped using for days. 

Its like I get a jolt of energy early in the morning way before I want to wake up, have the urge to move my toes, feel tingles, too hot then too cold, and  broken sleep until I eventually do wake up (if you can call it that) and then I dose and feel normal then take a nap and only really wake up fully in the afternoon and even then only sometimes. 

And on the days that I sleep with my girlfriend I wake up feeling so tired I cant do anything at all. I think one reason for that is that when I sleep at her house I usually dont dose until much later in the day so I don't get my morning nap and I feel like death all day. Super unproductive. 

Its amazing how much my subconscious was protecting the habbit. I simply never considered that it could be the kratom. It really sucks too cuz if it didnt make me tired I would have no issue with it. But here we are. Its gota go.",6

I was feeling stressed, and crampy from my period, so I took a full dose and it kicked hard, I threw up but felt great. I thought I was ready to just go back to my normal 10-15 gram a day habit. But I can‚Äôt... I can‚Äôt keep living like this, relying on this shit. I know it‚Äôs made me angry and bitter, it‚Äôs made me lazy and give excuses, it made me pick up cigarettes again.

Here's where the TMI bit comes in - I feel like I have diarrhea, but I am still constipated! How is this possible? I am not dehydrated either, I have been very faithful to drinking water and pee is nearly clear. It's frustrating because I feel like I have to poo but very little comes out. I have even been supplementing with fiber and Metamucil, but I think all the Kratom symptoms overpower that. This is just some late on-set withdrawal symptoms. But I'm powering through it. 

My goal is just to get at least 30min of weight lifting in. If I feel good enough to do 45min, great. An hour, even better. After that, I'm gonna give myself permission to be lazy and recover.

I can honestly say only the first two days were a little rough. I was on 15gpd for a year and a half. I will tell you though, my mind and body has been occupied with this gargantuan kidney stone stuck in my ureteur tube. It is 7x10 mm. This past Monday I had a ct scan done because I was seeing blood in my Urine. This past Wednesday it finally hit me hard, so hard, it led me to the hospital. This is when I found out my ct results. I have three stones, but the big one stuck in the tube was the one of concern. So they put me under anesthesia and were going to blast it out but saw an infection in the bladder and just decided to put a stent in from the kidney to the bladder. They want to get rid of the infection before they go up in and retrieve the stone. 

So as I sit here with this stent in me and this monster stone still in me, I can‚Äôt help but think that the Kratom and the major dehydration that I was having, while on the mean green, has caused this. I have a history of kidney stones, but very small ones and never three at a time. I know Kratom is a diuretic and can seriously dry you out and cause a host of other issues. 

So the couple of days before my stone adventure began were not to bad. A little RLS on the first night, lack of sleep, and frequent urination were my main concerns. What ever you do, STAY HYDRATED!!! Thanks for reading and have a fabulous day!!",31

2021-05-01 02:45:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/n2cz9f/first_time_weaning/,First time weaning,"I‚Äôm new to this forum. Quick backstory, I am 25 years old and an ex H and opiate addict. Before I picked up Kratom in March 2019, I accumulated 4 1/2 years of clean time under my belt from ALL mind altering substance (minus caffeine and nicotine). I landed a great job, stayed connected with fellowship, gave birth to my beautiful daughter 2 years into my recovery... my life was pretty solid. 

Then the pandemic happened. I lost my job because of it and a bad breakup ensued all in the same fucking week. I was on the verge of relapse until I realized I didn‚Äôt have anymore connects (thank God) and frankly I was heartbroken but I knew I couldn‚Äôt risk losing my daughter. I didn‚Äôt want to run the streets to get high so I decided to pick up Kratom for the first time instead to self medicate. I have heard so much about it when I was in rehab but I have never tried this stuff before, even to detox myself at home countless times. I had no idea the power something like this could carry especially if you haven‚Äôt had an opiate in your system for almost 5 years. In the first three months, it really did it‚Äôs job and I didn‚Äôt abuse it at first. It was almost unreal how amazing it was. I didn‚Äôt feel high, I just felt good. It made me feel relaxed, motivated and emotionally stable and even helped me move on from my last relationship... while also stripping me of my lust for life, my money, my personality and my HAIR. Then it just became a fucking job that I wasn‚Äôt getting paid for. I isolated from my family and friends and only focused on being a stay at home mom (which I wasn‚Äôt even good at when I started abusing it). But my only reason to keep doing it was ‚Äúwell.. at least I‚Äôm not doing H again‚Äù so I thought it was okay. I didn‚Äôt think I would take it as far as I did. But that‚Äôs the mind of an addict.

I started taking Kratom in March 2020. It quickly turned into a 35-40 gpd habit. I started the weaning process back in February when I realized what it was doing to my skin, my hair and most importantly my parenting and self esteem. I realized I was addicted and on it for far too long. It was time to let it go. I attempted to go CT but I only lasted a little over 24 hours. Being a single parent really prevents you from being able to lay in bed to detox all day and tend to your own needs so I attempted to slow wean instead. It has never worked out for me in the past with opiates but I am proud to say I am now at a solid 12 gpd and in the midst of removing my midday dose. I‚Äôve been using the 10% weaning method that I‚Äôve seen online. I‚Äôm anxious, but mostly excited because I miss who I  used to be. 

I spaced my 3 doses 6 1/2 hours apart and I‚Äôve been trying to push my last dose to 7 hours after my midday. I‚Äôm currently experiencing general anxiety, waking up in the middle of the night sweating and normal fatigue. I sleep at least 6 consecutive hours at night. No RLS or muscle pain as of now. I also get the ‚Äúdope sneezes‚Äù and yawning right before it‚Äôs time to dose. Does any of that sound normal and to be expected at this point? Any advice and reassurance on how to continue on with the weaning would be greatly appreciated. This page has already brought me so much solace and comfort.",6
