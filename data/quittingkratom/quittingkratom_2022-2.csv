Appreciate you so much - found you when I quit and had no idea what was happening.

I've found that so many withdrawal experiences are variable dependent on dosage, length of use, etc - but all scary. I found myself wanting to find someone that was somewhat like me, so I hope that I can provide that.

I'm 25 and have struggled with alcoholism for a couple of years. I'd say I'm functional, but have certainly had a lot of embarrassing experiences and wasted days. Last April, it started to impact my relationship with my SO who I valued deeply, so I quit. I had used K before, but the daily use began shortly as I headed into AA. It quickly filled the void and made alcohol easy to give up.

I won't talk too much about the alcohol, but my kratom use was daily for about 10 months. The first 1/3 was using about 10gdp-30gpd of crappy headshop stuff. During this period, it turned to all-day dosing. The other 2/3 was with higher quality online stuff. My use in this period ranged anywhere from 10gpd to 20gdp. I'd say if I averaged my overall use, it would land somewhere around 12gdp for this 10 month period.

My SO and my brother frequently told me that this was not the ""CBD-type drug"" I had believed it to be. They had similar experiences/seen others struggle with this drug. I thought myself smarter, to my SO's frustration.

I picked up drinking in moderation again with success due to the fact that I lived with my SO. However, I was broken up with out of nowhere and forced to move back to my mom's a few states away where I knew I'd have a support network.

Predictably, both of my addictions spiraled. I made a decision to get on naltrexone to limit my alcohol use. However, I learned, I'd have to be kratom-free for 7 days. I had no qualms about this as I had no idea that kratom even had severe withdrawals.

I did a quick taper from 10gpd over about 2 weeks to 0gpd. I was drinking heavily the first 3 days K-Free, and did not notice a thing.

The day my drinking bender ended, I was hit with some terrible nausea, anxiety, and depression. I attributed to the drinking - I had done this too many times before.

I had an internalized timeline as an alcoholic - when the anxiety should subside and when I should be feeling normal again. However, this proved to be different. I realized that it wasn't the alcohol when my brother, a former opioid addict, offered up the idea.

Here's what I experienced:

Days 1-3: Too drunk to notice anything lmao.

Day 4: Extreme nausea, depression, and anxiety. Likely compounded by alcohol hangover.

Day 5: No physical symptoms. Crippling depression and anxiety. I called family members just to cry. I felt absolutely desperate. I got a benzo which helped me sleep through the night. Still woke up many times with anxiety, very sweaty.

Day 6: Same as Day 5. I got a telehealth appointment with my primary care doctor. She wasn't very familiar with kratom and hesitant to prescribe anything, but I got a gabapentin 300mg prescription to take once before bed to help with insomnia. Helped a little. Woke up at least once every hour very sweaty.

Day 7: Woke up thinking I had COVID. This subreddit made me think that it was too late for flu symptoms. However, I was negative and confirmed on this subreddit that it was normal to be sick this late in the process. Sore throat, achiness, that weird feeling in my lungs. There was some prescription grade 600mg ibuprofen in the house which made it pretty much all go away.

The anxiety and depression were MUCH better this day. I had a cup of coffee and felt like I had taken an adderall. I listened to music as I ran some errands and felt so sensitive, like I had been sedated for the past 10 months and missing out on so much stimulation and emotion.

I took this sub's advice and got some L-Theanine. This helped tremendously when I was anxious. I have been megadosing vitamin C. I can't tell if it's helped too much because I've been taking ibuprofen. Also got some magneisum just in case the gabapentin didn't help the RLS enough. Doesn't seem to do too much on it's own for me, but maybe I'm not dosing correctly.

I had a great night out with friends, had about 4 drinks. Laughed a lot and forgot about everything for a while.

Sleep this night was pretty much the same as yesterday without a gabapentin. I took 10mg of melatonin and woke up just as frequently.

Day 8: Same as yesterday. Feeling relatively good, keeping busy. Had about 4 drinks again.

Day 9: Same as yesterday, but with some fear about the week where I can't be with friends 24/7 and will have to work. I made goals for each day of the week, plans for exercise, and plans with friends for every night.

&#x200B;

Overall, I feel like a lot of the emotions about my breakup and leaving my home are finally surfacing. I was suppressing them with K and alcohol. I thought I was dealing well, but realized I have only just begun to deal with my sadness over my particular situation. I feel so much dissatisfaction in my life right now. So many things I just let slide while I was using K - I made no effort to be creative, to improve, to find the things that brought me happiness on their own.

I'm sure I'm not done, but my experience seems mild compared to a lot of others on here. I know that through this process, I've read through so many of these posts looking for comfort. It really does get better.

I can already feel the ability to re-engage in hobbies, to reconnect with people, to get outside of my comfort zone. K made me happy to watch TV every night.

I'm getting too tired writing this so I'll stop, but I hope that this was of some value to someone.

Take care!

EDIT: I've also been on 15mg of Lexapro for a couple of years. I'm sure that has helped the experience. It helped me with anxiety unrelated to drugs when I was younger.

Well I guess I'm the great pretender, pretending that I'm going clean - as far as kratom goes, yes I'm off it still and don't feel many cravings at all, but my drug history has always been an ensemble arrangement. I've had my daily dependencies - weed, alcohol, codeine, kratom (three at the same time during the worst of it) but those have at various times been accompanied by psychedelics, MDMA, and periodic stimulant binges.

I'm at a bit of an impasse here because I know we can't talk about active drug use, so I'll just have to allude to indulging in a recently discovered stimulant and reprising a four month period of time in my early twenties I came to know as The Lost Saturdays.

It's not sustainable and one way or another will be tossed aside, but for now I'll take a big asterisk next to my clean points. Fortunately, I feel like a sad puppy when I think back to those first two days off last week when I broke out the old journal and fountain pen and wrote for about two hours.

Terrible withdrawals with all the stuff y’all are familiar with. 

Then after a few weeks I got back on it and built right back up to about 4 months straight of daily 10-20gpd. However this time I got a gym membership on day 1 and made sure I got one with a sauna and/or steam room. Did a light-mid workout each day and sat in sauna for 30 mins after every workout and drank a ton of water. 

All the sweating and endorphins from this super reduced the withdrawals and I’ve actually slept every night. I feel like I’m already through the withdrawals except for very minor stuff. Hope I’m not speaking too soon but woke up on day 5 today feeling better for sure. 

So if you wanna go cold turkey I would try to find your closest local center with weights and sauna and try it! It will help you cleanse faster immensely.

On this journey to health, everyone is different. What worked for me may not be what’s best for you.

How I quit:                                                      
I did a long taper (from 40-60gpd at my highest) over the course of a year. 

First, I cut my dosage in half to 28gpd, (into 4 7g doses that I took 4hrs apart). The WD were pretty intense, but my body regulated in about 2 weeks. I stayed at this amount for 4months.

I had become extremely underweight and malnourished during my addiction, and my goal was to work on eating regularly and to gain at least 10lb before getting to my final quit. I took each of my 4 doses mixed into protein shakes, and began eating 3 meals a day. I also began taking supplements listed below. I started feeling much better after doing this for a few months.

I then began tapering more slowly, by taking 1g less in each dose when I would cut, and would then stay at that amount for about a month. 
By the end I was down to 4 1g doses per day. It was here that I made the final jump. I had used for a total of 3yrs, the last of which was a long taper. My final WD acutes lasted about 2weeks, I dealt with PAWS off and on for a little over a year, and Ive been feeling back to normal this past year. 

What helped:                                                   
-Stopping taking doses on a empty stomach and adding them into a protein drink during taper.                                           
-Having consistent meal times.                          
-Establishing a strict abstinence policy after final jump (no kratom ever again, under any circumstances) -Supplementing with Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Iodine, Magnesium, and Digestive Enzymes.                     
-Taking Ashwaghanda and Rhodiola                                
- exercising every day even if I didn’t feel like it (walking, running, lifting weights)                                   
-hot showers and baths with lots of epsom salt               
-after final quit, having a hot chocolate w/ good quality raw cocoa, raw honey, vanilla, cream, and butter blended until frothy when I would normally dose                        
- quitting caffeine (it sucked but really made me feel better)

At least this time I know what's going on. Back in November I was going through some relationship turmoil, stopped taking my daily Kratom so I would have a clear head. I believed I was suffering from anxiety, panic attacks because of the breakup. Feelings I have never experienced before. This was followed by intense RLS at night. That's when I found this sub and realized what was actually going on. 

As was all too easy, I went back to drinking this insidious sludge after about 7 days and the habit continued. 

This ""plant"" snuck into my life. An afternoon treat. It made the last few hours of work more enjoyable. Then I started to notice I was getting increasingly irritable after lunch. I would snap at people, my son included for no reason. That irritability left as soon as I dosed. It took weeks/months to actively notice the connection. 

I have been very successful in repressing the thought that this is poison. Even while I sit clenched over the toilet struggling to get a movement. Even while I can actively feel the difference in my hair. It was easy to hide. It looks like a health drink. Gulp Gulp Gulp. Done.

And so here I am. I tapered very quickly this week dropping my dose in half for a few days - had flu like symptoms and then went CT yesterday.  I have no idea how much I was taking. Enough to get high. And of course that meant more and more. 2+ yrs of use. 

So today, I take charge. I welcome the sweats, the swings in emotions. Real emotions, pure joy and depression. Bring it on.

For those who have not quit & are scared of the PAWS. I will tell you that as your dosage increases & tolerance goes up, the negative side effects of kratom can be brutal as well. I continued to have to increase my dose due to my tolerance going up. I remember getting sick when I had too much kratom, I would pass out, get hot flashes, problems sleeping, headaches, my hair was thinning (as a woman that was scary). I don't even know the full extent of the damage to my body & my already compromised kidneys. 

Quitting is more than worth it. Don't be afraid of the PAWS, as this sludge can bring on very bad side affects from long term use.

I saw a few posts on this issue, but from what I've seen, the posts are just asking if anyone else felt the same way, without any coping mechanisms brought up.

I have a past of anxiety and depression. I was also an opiate addict for years, after being treated with leukemia. I started using kratom to get off the opiates, and it really worked. 2 years later, I started getting the feeling of depersonalization/dissociating, so I started tapering off the kratom because I figured it was the culprit of the feeling. In doing so, the feeling got worse, and worse. To the point that I felt like a shell, and within that shell, I felt PURE TERROR. The same feeling you would get if you jumped off of a building, but doesn't go away. I stopped working for a few months because I was incapable of working at all...the feeling was so bad. It put a huge burden on my relationship, my daily life (I felt paralyzed....I couldn't do simple tasks). The feeling lasted a couple months before I started feeling better. But I was in pure hell. There was literally nothing worse I could imagine. I was all alone, dealing with that hell, literally just trying to wait it out. I started feeling normal again, until I was 100% back to my old self. Then, I STARTED TAKING KRATOM AGAIN.

I know it was an idiotic choice. And I fully regret that choice, because a year later, I'm feeling the exact same as I did before. If not, even worse. The dissociating/depersonalization....the falling feeling...which is just pure terror. It all started a few days ago, the feeling went away, felt fine for a day or two. Then started feeling like it again last night, burned some kratom, and went to bed perfectly fine. But I woke up at 6 am this morning, and was thrown full force into all the symptoms I previously talked about, and it hasn't let up at all. I only see it getting worse. Yes, I have cut back a tiny bit, but the feeling I'm getting now is how I felt after stopping cold turkey the first time. I don't know if I can handle this if it gets any worse.

At first I thought it really helped my depression and anxiety, but kratom quickly became the only thing I looked forward to and has only helped me avoid feelings that I need to feel to get better. In these 6 months I’ve probably taken about 20 consecutive days off (1 week at a time). I started Prozac in early January and told myself I’d keep using kratom only until those started working. But it has now been 6 weeks and a dosage increase later and I haven’t noticed any major antidepressant effects. I’m thinking my kratom usage may be affecting it. I’m at the point where I take several tablespoons per dose and don’t feel much of the good feeling that drew me to kratom in the first place. Part of the reason it’s been so hard to quit is because I know I can head to the shop around the corner, grab a bag, and instantly feel better for a little bit. I’m clearly addicted and its not adding anything to my life. I’ve bounced from one addiction to another (people, drugs, weed, nicotine, alcohol, kratom) since I was in middle school and I don’t know how to permanently break the cycle. I am in therapy but haven’t brought this up yet because I’m embarrassed to admit that I’m actively addicted to something. 
Any advice on quitting cold turkey would be greatly appreciated. (Also, if you started SSRIs while using kratom and they were more effective after you quit I’d love to know)

I have been a binge user for a good part of my adult life.  I got off the hard stuff for good about 6 years ago and used kratom to do so, which then spurred on a whole new addiction of its own.  Seems like a typical story in these parts.

I was finally able to kick my binge use of kratom about 2 years ago, had a relapse about 10 months in then got clean again for another 14 months!  It felt so good to be clean for that long, and honestly kratom didn’t even creep into my consciousness very much.  I really don’t like the person I am when I’m on that stuff.  It numbs the emotion pain but dulls every aspect of life.  No way to live. 

Then, my accident happened.  I had a bad fall rock climbing 2 months ago.  Shattered my tibia on one leg, compound fracture in the ankle on the other leg, broken bones in the ankle and foot, broken shoulder and torn rotator cuff.  I had to have multiple surgeries and experienced the worst pain of my life.  I was on all sorts of IV painkillers when I was in the trauma unit and recovering from multiple surgeries, then got put on Oxy for my recovery.  There is no doubt that I needed them, and I did a very good job taking them as prescribed.  Three weeks ago I transferred to kratom to get off the pain killers and was taking around 50GPD.  

So overall 2 months of pretty high pain killer and kratom use from the accident.  I just started walking again this week and decided it was time to get off everything.  I am still in a lot of pain and could absolutely legitimately justify kratom and pain killer use, but I know I needed to get off this poison ASAP.  The longer I wait the worse it will be. 

Day 3 CT and oh boy do I hate being here again. Cold sweats, restless legs, very little sleep, nausea, and a flood of emotions coming back from being numb for 2 months.  This is my first CT where I have megadosed with Liposomal Vitamin C, and it seems to have taken the edge off.  Lots of hot showers and baths.  I know I am getting close to the end of the worst of the acute symptoms.  

I am also very proud of myself for being able to have something incredibly traumatic happen to me, get prescribed pain killers and get off them when I have. I’ve lurked on these forums for support when quitting kratom before and gained a lot of value and support from reading others story’s.

We've noticed a growing trend (and have been for a while now) of mothers with small children who want to / need to quit Kratom. I'll admit, for quite some time, I personally, was ignorant of the potential struggles this could add to an already difficult habit / addiction to quit. In addition, many who are addicted are single parents who don't have friends or family close by, and / or don't know about the sufferer's addiction, and more often than not for good reasons. Being a stay-at-home mom, whether with a partner who works all day or is a single parent, can make it very difficult to go through withdrawals and kick this ugly addiction. 

**The request**: If you're a mother with young children who's successfully quit Kratom, whether it be by either [Cold Turkey (CT)](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/6gvk7f/guide_to_quitting_kratom_cold_turkey_by/) or [Tapering](https://old.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/) or even medically assisted, can you please share in the comments of this post how you managed to do it. What were your struggles with being a parent and making the decision to quit? How'd you overcome those potential roadblocks to quitting? Etc. Etc.

If this post gets enough support, we can use it as sort of a special wiki for those who need it.

There are at least a couple of days that having this space to share definitely made the difference for me.  I was using around 60+ gpd near the end, using powder throughout the day, and a combo of extract and otc sleep aid at night.  When I decided I was ready to start quitting, the first thing I stopped was the extract/sleep aid combo, then started tapering with powder over the course of two weeks. And when I say taper, well, it was kind of all over the place.  More than anything, I was trying just to get through my last 250 bag as responsibly as I could at the time. I’ve used on and off since about 2017, and this was definitely the hardest quit from K I’ve ever experienced.  Joint/body pain was the main physical thing, and I dealt with that from the second I started cutting back until about a week and a half into being fully quit.  The most encouraging thing during withdrawal though was a few days in when I realized I wasn’t feeling like I was coming down with the flu every 5 hours like I did when I was trying to taper.  Mentally, though, I feel like things have just started to feel a little brighter.  It’s literally just been the past couple of days I actually feel like I’m doing better without kratom.

My two best friends know I use, but not the amount, how much I've spent, how I plan my day around my next dose, and how much it affects me when I don't take it. I tell them it's been a godsend for my anxiety, and it used to be. But I can't tell you the last time I've felt anything from it and I've just been throwing money out the window to not feel withdrawals from it. I feel so much shame from my dependence on it and idk I just want to write down my story and get it out there so I don't feel so alone in this.

When I first started taking it I was in a high stress and physical job. I was eating like crap, my sleep consisted of naps, and had a lot of past and ongoing trauma I was actively ignoring by working so much. I was already close to a breaking point when I first tried it. Got some from a smoke shop and researched it a little. I was told it would feel like taking a vicodin. I was never a fan of how opioids made me feel lazy and sleepy so I figured trying it on a night to wind down and chill out wouldn't get me addicted. I have adhd and bad social anxiety so I've always loved uppers and have had bad problems benzos that I got clean from about 8 years ago.

The first time I used it I was also smoking some weed and tbh didn't really feel much of anything. I was worried about it upsetting my stomach so I only took a gram every hour so see what it would do. Nothing noticeable happened so I thought these are dumb and were a waste of money, and threw my remaining capsules back in my purse. Months went by without using anything. Then I had a very rough week at work. Was working 16 hour shifts back to back, short staffed, and had to let go of our kitchen manager for doing some dumb shit. At home I was in a soul sucking, abusive relationship and at work I was not holding it together. I couldn't leave or take a break and was desperate so I thought ""maybe I'll just take a bunch of these pills at once and it will do SOMETHING."" That euphoria and energy was like nothing I had felt. I did not feel any brain fog, my life long anxiety was wiped away, the chronic pain in my legs was no longer noticeable, and overall just felt a wave or relief.

Then I continued using. Started out as once a day, then amped up to grabbing a few pills every few hours. I was never paying attention to when or how much I was grabbing and started feeling sick if I was taking too much. My stomachs weak tolerance for any vitamin or supplement definitely helped me in the long run. I started timing out my doses so achieve what I needed, but not get sick. At my highest I was between 25-30 gpd. I was losing weight and felt on top of the world. But still, the absence of my anxiety was THE THING that I loved most about it and never wanted to give up.

I got a new job two years ago that is an easy 9 to 5 and the people I work with are so laid back. Also got out of the terrible relationship causing me stress at home. I was able to cut my dose to around 16-18 grams a day. I wasn't really feeling anything, but it made me feel safe knowing I could take more if something bad happened.

Fast forward to the past year. I went through an emotional breakup while also doing trauma therapy and was at a very low point in my life. It was either sink father back into my old habits of abusing whatever substance I could and trying to cling onto romantic partners as my only source of happiness. I decided to go the route where I slowly work on my mental and physical health. It has been a long up and down process but I've made a lot of accomplishments over this time. I quit cigarettes after 12 years, I've cut my binge drinking from a few times a week to once a month, I've started a supplement/vitamin program to nourish my body and mind, and I've stopped relying on the approval of others to bring me happiness. 

I still have a lot more to work on, but I've established a foundation where I feel mentally ready to quit. It's just a money pit and it causes the anxiety and muscle pain I try to claim it ""fixes"". It used to, but that isn't the case anymore and hasn't been for a long time. In the past two months I've dropped down to 14 gpd, then 12 gpd, then 9 gpd, and yesterday I had my lowest of 5 gpd with a 14 hour break in between doses. While I'm proud of it, I'm not going to take that long of a break again because the withdrawals convinced me to take more than I planned on this morning. Now I can feel very mild effects and that's a road I don't need to go down. I had 2.5 this morning and will take another 2 in the late afternoon. I'm so close to being done with this, but I also feel like my jump to 5 gpd was too quick and I might bump it up to 6 gpd and take 2 every 8 hours. Then a week from now cut that back to 1.5 every 8 hours.

I can't wait until the day comes that I don't reach for my nightstand drawer to choke back pills first thing in the morning. I can't wait until I don't have to fill up a pill bottle with my capsules of kratom before leaving for work. I can't wait until I don't have to plan out when and where I can take my pills without someone seeing me. I can't wait until I'm no longer one of the smoke shop's regulars.

I used to treat kratom like a daily supplement or antidepressant and made myself belief I could safetly take this long term and it would always be beneficial. I should have been treating it more like a benzo. It's been something that has masked my mental and physical issues and I easily developed a tolerance to where it was only curing the withdrawals it caused. Some people might be able to use it sparingly, but I'm not one of them. Addiction is in my genes once I finally quit, I have to be done for good. I'm going to continue giving myself more tools to cope with the anxiety and depression so I don't need to reach for a substance when shit hits the fan. I'm going to finally be healthy. But I'm not going to do anything I don't feel ready to do. Slow and small beneficial changes in habits have always been how I succeed and that's something I always need remember. Some days I might slip up a little, but that doesn't mean I failed and should throw in the towel.",15,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993041753768921}"

The people are so supportive, watching the daily counts grow has been encouraging. It seems unlikely that I could have done it alone.

I'm a former psychonaut and addict, and I have done most everything.  But most pertinently, I was an IV H and CM user in the 90s.  Celebrated 22 years free of those before I discovered K, 4 years ago.  I was instantly hooked.  It was a milder high than IV H for sure, but a very close cousin, and within 4 days I struggled to stop using it.  The ensuing 4 years saw me binge and quit, moving from powder, to caps, to extracts. I quit once for 7 months.  But each relapse came because I changed my mind. I could feel it happen. It was like a pebble on a balance scale, shifting one pan just a millimeter lower, and even if I fought it for several days, I knew it was coming.  

Then, a few months ago, through the help of discussions with my bestie, I realized that this addiction had a root outside the feelings I got with K. I was afraid to take control of my life because of past experiences with self-determination and self-control.  I had ""learned helplessness.""  And so I avoided pursuing my dreams and kept them as a hobby.  So I accepted work I was not suited for just to please the people around me.  I avoided facing my feelings entirely and repressed them for the sake of pleasing others. After decades of living like that, I realized that I am poised to take any drug that helps me avoid feeling.  So my whole house of cards was based on addiction to H, booze, MJ, and finally K. 

When I decided to quit and face my feelings, the whole edifice collapsed really quickly. Of my 4 pillars of quitting - one is to feel the present fully.  Thanks to many years of meditation practice, that has become something I have a skill to manifest. By no means perfectly or continually, but more and more often.

I know in my heart (and this is language that doesn't come naturally to me with a life-long persona as a pragmatic, atheistic rationalist-wannabe), that I have a soul, at that my heart and soul are sure that the only way out is complete sobriety and complete honesty (with myself). 

There is this old saw that I heard or read somewhere, that the only way to win is not to fight.  It made no sense to me when I first heard it, but thanks to age, time, experience, and meditation, I think I get it.  When we fight something, we set ourselves up in opposition.  We prime ourselves and our ""opponent"" for the continued perception of ""otherness.""  I build an attack and stimulate my opponent to learn a new defense.  Like the germs that become antibiotic resistant, or insects that evolve to be resistant to pesticides, etc. And in this scheme, we become our own opponents!

Don't get me wrong, ""fighting"" has its place in the short term. I needed to steel myself to endure the initial burden of acute withdrawals.  But I think I also benefited from cultivating a non-oppositional stance to switch to for the long haul.  An observing stance that lets every thought, feeling and sensation be, without adding judgement or action to it.  

I am by no means out of the woods.  But my confidence has never been higher.  I can honestly say that I haven't doubted my commitment to remaining sober even once since a few weeks before I finally stopped after my last dose on New Years Day. Even the few times when my old brain circuits fired bringing me an impulse to head to the headshop, my confidence has not faltered. The thought rose, I looked gently at it, and it went away.

I wrote all this just to share, and I hope it can be encouraging in some way to any one of you beautiful souls. We each have a unique path to tread, and different strategies will wend us different ways, but I hope we all continue to head in the same direction.  Away from addition and avoidance.

I've used kratom on and off for 2-3 years, never had much problem taking it consistently for a few months and dropping it without any side effects. I honestly thought of kratom as ""the one drug I use that I've never been addicted to."" I used to take capsules, never more than 2.5 grams at a time, but that all changed recently. I started taking kratom primarily a few months ago, as I was trying to quit weed and needed a crutch (I have CHS, so kratom seemed like a much safer alternative to weed at the time). But now I'm starting to suspect my kratom use is the cause behind a lot of my physical ailments lately. I think I have some kind of colitis, my bowel movements are terribly inconsistent and I can feel and move around my colon in my stomach like a hernia- even had hernia surgery on it a few months ago because the doctor didn't care about doing a proper inspection and just assumed that a hernia was the answer. Recently I've had a lot of issues with my throat, like a large lump is caught in it, and I've had way too many occasions where pills will get lodged in it and I'll have to wait as they incredibly uncomfortably dissolve inside of my throat. (Don't worry, I have doctor's appointments for both of these things sheduled) I'm beginning to suspect that this is my thyroid, and Kratom is to blame for that as well. Before about 2-3 months ago, my use was under control, but when I started dealing with this throat issue I got turned off of capsules and decided to start making my own alcohol extractions. As I should have seen before, this only led me to vastly increase my daily use and exacerbate all of these symptoms. So, it's finally time to quit. Took my last dose yesterday around noon, so far so good. No noticable withdrawal symptoms, hoping that I can make it through without many issues since that's how all my other kratom disuse periods have been, but I've never used so much for this long of a time period so I'm not incredibly confident that I can get away with zero withdrawals.

in this post I'll tell you a story about my almost-relapse (someone calls it ""dry relapse"" - it sounds really weird :D), and I'll also try to sum up some learning point's I have got from the experience. I hope it will be helpful to some of you guys. I will try to write in first person because I understand that everyone is different. Anything I write below might not apply (and probably wont) to everyone. So please take it as such. I am also not native english speaker so I apologize for any grammar mistakes in advance...

# Story about how I have almost relapsed

For me, it is very easy to not take Kratom when I am in acute withdrawals (from now on I'll refer to withdrawals as WDs) (once I make it over 1-2 days acute WDs hit hard and I really commit to quitting), the anxiety, digestion problems, trouble sleeping, etc. It all reminds me why I have quit and I know if I start taking again, I'll just postpone this and eventually have to go through that all over again. 

The problem with staying of Kratom in the long term starts (for me) when I get over acute WDs and when the anxiety lifts. This time, that was after around 4 weeks. After 4 weeks I was able to be by myself without feeling anxious. And I got covid. I was really glad I did not get it earlier. I was fine and being in isolation was manageable as it would be without any WDs and stuff. I was bored and bummed out I had to stay at home (my covid was ok, I had cough, sore throat and was tired. That was all, no raised temperature, no shortness of breath...).

But I was bored and thought to myself, ""Why not just Google 'Kratom', it's not like relapsing right?"". Well that was the start of the chain of events that lead to my ""dry relapse"". Actually the start was the thought of googling it but it's hard to keep thoughts from not appearing. So I consider the first event that lead to relaps to actually acting and googling.

Guess what? I have discovered they sell Kratom near me. Something I did not know about. Next thought? ""Well if I go there what happens? I mean, I wonder how it looks. How they sell it? Do they have it displayed or do I have to ask for it? And if I buy Kratom and take it (just once), my time in isolation would be much more enjoyable"". All those questions are irrelevant, I never want to take Kratom again, but I thought that. And I have entertained that thought by going on a walk near the shop.

While I was near the shop I thought ""Why not go in?"" and I went. I took honey and some juice, and went to pay. I was scanning the shop for Kratom bags. I did not see them anywhere. And I was thinking ""Ok, I have went through all the WDs, bought the therapist sessions, wrote every day on this sub, told friends, just to buy Kratom and take it again? Do I really want to do it?"". Honestly, I was pretty scared. I knew I would have to tell my therapist about it, and I knew I would have to reset my counter and write a post about it. I knew I would be met with acceptance, but I just did not want to go through it... So I just payed for the honey and juice, and left the shop without asking for Kratom. 

I did not think about it much since then. Until I went to my therapist. We talked about this. And to her, it was much bigger deal than to me. She told me, that we should talk about it and we should find out why have I done it and learn from it. It was a lot of luck, not sure what would have I done if they had Kratom bags displayed.

# Learning points - how to overcome cravings and temptations in long term

So, here is my take on this. Let me give you few resources and ideas on how to prevent relapse. This is especially useful to someone who has 30 days +. Until then (at least in my experience, this might not apply to everyone...) it's about WDs management. But the real work starts after WDs are gone or greatly reduced. 

**Invest into your quit.**

This is very important in my opinion. Tell people around you. Buy a therapist sessions. Write long posts on this sub.

Also, **read books, listen podcasts, watch Youtube videos about addiction**. Addictions to different things are not that different. Some people are addicted to gambling, sex, alcohol... What interests me particularly is addiction to Heroin and other opiates. I find it to be very similar to Kratom addiction. Go figure right, Heroin is opioid and Kratom is also that. Of course, Kratom is several magnitudes weaker, and quitting Heroin must be so hard that I feel a bit bad comparing it to Kratom. But still, it helps to listen to other people stories, read books about how they overcome their addictions. What am I trying to say is **Don't be discouraged reading about addictions to other things than Kratom.** It is more similar than it is different.

Here are **some resources that you can look into** (can't post links, so I post keywords and site, just search them there you'll find it):

* *Youtube*: Rich Roll - great channel about overcoming addictions. I especially recommend podcast with Anna Lembke - she wrote Dopamine Nation - see below.
* *Youtube*: CGKid - another great channel about overcoming addiction and what addiction is like. 
* *Youtube*: PsychedSubstance - Youtuber that struggles with Kratom addiction. To be honest, there is something I don't like about his approach to it, not sure why. I feel like there is maybe some humility missing in it. But check out his latest videos about his family leaving him (because of Kratom and other drugs) and about him coming back and overcoming it.
* *Book*: Dopamine Nation from Anna Lembke - I red 50% of this book in one evening. It's so good! Just get the free sample on you Kindle or iPad (or wherever). I promise you you'll be interesed in the book right away. Anna Lembke is therapist specializing on addiction. She explains the chemistry of addiction (from the point of view of dopamine - so this even applies to non-drug addictions). And how to overcome it. And there are many stories of her clients in the book.

Invest into your quit. Write joirnal about how you feel or post into daily thread and be as expressive as possible. Tell us about how you feel, what's going on, what are you doing and other stuff. It really helps us (seing we are not alone here), and I believe it will help you too. 

**Recognize the chain of events that leads to relapse**

Every relaps has a long runway. The chain of events that leads to relaps might go on for weeks before actual relaps happens. Usually there are little things that seems like coincidences that lead to relaps. Let me give you an example.

1. Today you feel tired, maybe you had bad day, or bad sleep, or you just feel off  
2. Today you are by coincidence driving/walking around shop where you know they sell Kratom  
3. And by coincidence you need some other thing they sell there. You enter into shop  
4. Now you buy Kratom, because you are there, starts are aligned and relaps is very easy. Preventing it is very hard when you are in the shop, you just buy it and take it at home.  


It is very easy to see those things as coincidence. In the events above you can see, you never really decide to take it. But it just happens. Little innocent steps....  


What to do with it? Be mindful, recognize when you are rationalizing the bad thing. Is there a gas station near you that sells Kratom? Promise yourself to never go there. Even if you had to run out of gas. Going there is as important as not taking Kratom. Do you feel like googling ""Kratom""?  Recognize where that can lead and stop it. You have decided to quit. It is not innocent coincidence, you know that and you can stop it.  


Don't try to stop the thoughts taking Kratom. We can't prevent ourselves from thinking something. But we CAN prevent ourselves to not acting on it. This is where the mindfulness meditation is very useful (but not mandatory). Here is my approach when I encounter thought that I think should lead to relapse:   


1. Accept it, appreciate the opportunity to practice soberness. It's like a muscle and this is one rep. It will make me stronger if I deal with it.
2. Recognize the action the thought is trying to make me do. Is it about going near the Kratom shop? Is it about googling something about Kratom? Is it wish to research how to take Kratom responsibly? 
3. Understand where acting on it would lead me - to relapse. Read posts I have made when I was WDing hard. Read what have I wrote before I quit. How I was unhappy and sad about my life. Think about how would I feel if in 10, 20, 50 years I would still use Kratom. Also think about how happy I am right now. How proud I am about being sober so far? 
4. If possible. Write post on this sub (or into my journal, into notepad on my phone or just call to a fried). Just a few sentences.
   1. Describe the thought
   2. Describe the action thought is trying to make me do
   3. Write about what have I went through (or what are you still going through) to stop.
   4. Write about how have I life improved since I have stopped taking
   5. Ask for support and encouragement. We get it I promise!

**Dont lie**

This one is odd and surprising, but I think it really makes a difference. I heard it from multiple therapist. Don't lie. It's hard to tell the truth and sometimes the truth is hard to find, but it very easy to spot our lies. If you come late for an appointment or meeting with a friend don't say that there was traffic or that the bus had delay (if that is not true ofc). Just be honest, tell the truth, say you have departed later. That you forgot, or the other thing that happened.

This is not about telling everyone everything (there is nothing wrong with saying ""I don't want to talk about it""). But it's about not saying something that is not true. It might seem, like it is not important. But it is very important. The worst thing is lying to ourselves and this helps us to not do it. Even in overcoming addiction. Look into ""Extreme ownership"" by Jocko Willing. Not lying will force us to own our mistakes, and own ourselves. Not living in a lie. I believe that most addiction happens as a result of disconnection and can be solved by connecting again (to our friends, to ourselves, to world around us). **Living in a lie is living in a world that is not real. How are we supposed to be connected to anything if we live in a world that is not real?**

# Final words / tldr

I was close to relapsing. It was because I keep acting little ""insignificant"" actions and they added up. I found myself in a shop where they sell Kratom and I have almost bought it. It was luck I did not.

To prevent it in the future I should: 

1. Keep investing my time, money and energy into quitting
2. Recognize the chain of events that leads to relapse
3. Share my pre relapse thoughts with others. Understand that action on those thoughts will lead to relapse.
4. Don't lie",18,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9961511492729187}"

I don't have strong will power vit b and d I think have helped but its slow I've doubled my dose of antidepressant.and am coping remarkably well all considering with break up .it's taken my mind off the pains.so guess everything for a reason.not that I'm recommending a break up after 35 years to help withdrawel symptoms.you can all do this I promise.and the success is a natural dopamine upper.yesterday I did my first walk with music and it helped a lot.good luck everyone keep sharing stories but remember we are all unique,some may take 3 days to withdraw.some are still having paws 6 months on.please god it's short for most.xxxxxxxxx",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9853596091270447}"

I’ve been in and out of here not sure if anyone on here remembers me. I’ve made it a little ways but never made it more than 3 or 4 days passed the end of acutes. I hit 14 days yesterday and was super excited to make a post here but I got busy ACTUALLY DOING STUFF WITH PEOPLE (kratom isolated me from the people who care about me). Anyways day 15 and I am trying for the second time to start naltrexone. First time I had 7 days clean and took it it made me feel really weird woozy kept me from sleeping headache and stomach ache. Figured I hadn’t waited long enough. I started with 6mg and was ok so I took the rest of the half and that stuff happened. Got no sleep had work so I caved and bought. I had given all my money to my parents but asked for it back since I couldn’t get high with the naltrxone. Anyways 5 day relapse and I got back on my feet. Now I’m at 15 days talked with doc he suggested I try just the 6mg and titrate up. I did that but figured it’s been 15 days I’m ok. Which I was no headache no stomach ache but I did have insomnia and this weird drunk calm feeling. Think that’s just side effects and will go away adjusting over time. But I asked again for my money back and slipped up a few hours ago. This adjustment is hard I’m actually doing better taking nothing and not being able to buy. I’m feeling good but I need to be able to have my money and use the naltrexone to keep me from using rather than just cuz I have no money. My question is can I just take the naltrexone tomorrow morning?,3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9961696267127991}"

I can’t believe it.,"Even though I’ve quit in the past, this time as all times before felt, well… different. I felt as if I needed it to work, to socialize, play music, in less words, to just live my life. But that’s far from the truth. That’s just the lies the addiction and dependent part of the brain tells you. It’s not true. It’s the complete opposite. 

I prayed and talked to God for the first time in a long time today. Like for real prayed. And I just surrendered and asked for strength again to get off this crap. I know all may not believe in Jesus, but He is my rock. I became a believer 6 or 7 years ago. He turned my life around. And I started holding my actions accountable. I realized what I did just didn’t affect myself, but everyone around me. Did I struggle? Obviously. Do I still struggle? Oh yes. 


It’s not a walk in the park. I don’t want to hide in my faith and pray it all away. But learn from this pain, from these experiences and use it for the great or good for others one day. Maybe even today. And I knew I couldn’t and can’t become that person if I’m messed up. 

I went to work tonight, which I didn’t think was possible going cold turkey. And I made it. I made it without the shot. And I’m so grateful and filled with joy and hope. It’s like God gives me the choice to do what I want, and I know once I make the right one, it’s not easy but it’s possible with the strength given. 

I’m not in anyway pushing religion here. I’m just clearly stating my own personal feelings here right now and wanted to praise Jesus. My fiancé has been so supportive. And I’m so thankful for her. And thankful for my friends, you guys, for showing so much support. I love you. Even though I don’t know you. Even though we don’t share the same pain in exact ways, I’m right there with you. Fighting the good fight. We are not alone. Please, keep trying. And don’t ever stop. 


Physically, I’m aching. My chest hurts. It’s almost like a sore throat, post nasal drip. Sneezing a lot. But I’m making it.

I honestly feel like a zombie and it's becoming harder and harder for me to justify quitting to myself. I miss feeling euphoric and enthusiastic about getting my daily activities done. I miss enjoying relaxation. I don't miss who I had become. I was aiming down. I have been pushing myself to put my life together, but it's such a fucking slog. None of it gives me any reward or pleasure. Just work. It's so tedious. I want to be the best version of myself, but if I am going to hate every waking moment of it what is the point? My addict brain keeps trying to convince me I could both have pleasure and get my life in order, but I know I would justify progressively more self-destructive behavior. I just don't know if I can truly enjoy a life without that feeling. I miss it honestly. I miss feeling at peace for once in my life. I just wish I could have that without tearing myself to pieces and hurting everyone around me. I see so many people here who are 5 days in and talking about how awesome their life is. I envy that. I am on antidepressants and I talk to a therapist. Nothing gives me that relief. I workout and I do the wim hof shit and it helps momentarily, but today has been a moment of weakness for me. I really hate that my life revolves around fighting the urge to give in. Is this how the rest of life is going to be? A constant battle of justifications and false promises that ""tomorrow will be better""? It doesn't seem like it will be. I'm trying so hard to maintain some level of optimism, but I find it hard to cope with the fact that I might never be able to feel that level of relaxation or peace again. Am I doing something wrong? I just fucking hate this man. It feels like I am constantly dragging around an anchor. I feel like my brain is incapable of producing that level of euphoria or comfort naturally. Nothing else I do really seems to compare. I try not to compare it, but its very difficult for me. I know it was fake, but I felt GREAT, even if only for fleeting moments. Now I'm just dragging myself through life, forcing myself to work on my hobbies and workout. Everything seems so arbitrary. I'm sorry if this was overly negative.

2022-02-25 14:36:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/t1cfy3/coping_strategies_for_withdrawal_induced_rls/,Coping Strategies for Withdrawal induced RLS (Restless Legs Syndrome),"We all know how difficult dealing with Restless Legs (and sometimes Arms) Syndrome (RLS) can be during the acute phase of withdrawal from Kratom (and opiates in general). RLS can be a leading contributor to Insomnia during this stage of withdrawal. And god knows how bad we just want a good night sleep during this difficult time. Just a few hours of continuous deep sleep can make a world of difference in how we feel the next day. 

The good news is, there is relief ahead as withdrawal symptoms begin to subside. But what the hell can we do in the meantime?!

* **Most importantly**, once you've committed to quitting Kratom (whether your approach is going [Cold Turkey (CT)](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/6gvk7f/guide_to_quitting_kratom_cold_turkey_by/) or [Tapering](https://old.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/)), **don't fall into the trap of ""I'm just going to take 'a little bit' of Kratom to take the edge off of these damn restless legs.""** (""Just this one last time"" is a common rationalization for us addicts, isn't it?) While this might seem like a good idea in the moment, this can be dangerous, because it can prolong withdrawal symptoms and you've just given yourself permission to use Kratom again... So what's stopping you from doing it again tomorrow night... And the next day... And the next. And the next. Many of us set ourselves up for ""failure"" without even realizing it, prolonging the endless cycle of addiction. The cycle must be broken at some point. The only way to begin to break the cycle is through non-use.

* **Ask your doctor about short-term prescription medication.** Suggestions may include Clonidine and Gabapentin. But again, SHORT-TERM use is recommended... with doctors supervision only. These drugs have the risk of dependency. The last thing we want to do is trade one addiction for another.

* **OTC (over the counter) solutions and supplements**. Some members here have found relief from RLS during acute WDs with products such as Hylands Restful Legs and black seed oil (BSO for withdrawals in general). In addition, studies have shown that supplements such as magnesium citrate, iron, and vitamin C can help to ease RLS symptoms. These are just a few. (Be sure to check out [Mega-Dosing Liposomal Vitamin C protocol for Withdrawal](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/sx0as3/megadosing_liposomal_vitamin_c_protocol_for/) which is listed on the sidebar of this subreddit.)

* **CBD and THC** (for those who can tolerate it). For those who experience increased anxiety from Delta 9 THC, Delta 8 *may* be an alternative. Again, beware of dependency and ""trading one addiction for another"".

* These **Home Remedies** may offer some relief: **Temperature treatment** - Soak in a hot bath or alternatively, try a cold shower. Use hot pads or ice packs on your legs - experiment to see what helps. **Massage** - Get a leg massage just before bedtime. (Some people find this beneficial, though others find it worsens symptoms.) You might also want to try a handheld massager or leg massager machine that you can use on yourself in the middle of the night.
**Regular moderate exercise** - Moderate exercise during the day can decrease restlessness at night, but avoid vigorous exercise within a couple of hours of sleep, since this can exacerbate sleep problems. Ideally, choose exercises that engage the leg muscles.
**Wrapping** - Try a tension bandage wrapped around your legs (be careful not to wrap too tight.)
**Pantyhose or compression stockings** - Some people prefer compression stockings by day and pantyhose or long socks for a more comfortable night’s sleep.
**Creams and lotions** – Icy-Hot, Tiger-Balm, etc.
**Stretching and / or yoga** - Stretching may help alleviate symptoms temporarily, but some people find that deep stretches provide hours of relief.
**Weight** - Some members here have found a weighted blanket to be very beneficial.
**Meditation and breathing exercises** can relax the entire body. Many members here have found [Wim Hof Method breathing](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/7si4ui/the_wim_hof_methodan_awesome_little_set_of/) very effective for relaxation.
**Orgasm** can provide temporary relief.
**Soap under the blankets** - sounds ridiculous, right? This is an odd remedy but some people swear by it. Place a bar of regular soap under your blankets by your feet. Advocates say that something in the soap (magnesium, lavender, etc.) seeps into the skin and alters your body chemistry. Magnesium and lavender are popular additions to sleep aids, but there is no scientific evidence that a bar of soap in the bed will help relax your legs.

**Avoid or minimize the following**: Caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, refined sugar intake and antihistamines, such as Actifed, Sudafed, Benadryl (diphenhydramine) and Nytol. (Though these  antihistamines are commonly recommended as OTC sleep aids, they can worsen RLS symptoms.) Also, Melatonin, although a helpful sleep-aid for some for short periods, it can intensify RLS symptoms because it lowers the amount of dopamine in the brain.

**For withdrawals and overall physical and mental well-being in general, be sure to get as much exercise as you can endure during the day, but again, don’t exercise too close to bedtime, as this can exacerbate RLS at night.**

You *WILL* get through this. It takes time for the body to heal and the brain to ""rewire"" itself. Think of it as a computer. We're rebooting ourselves. For those who are old enough to remember, acute withdrawals are like the ""blue screen of death"". And RLS is the main ""bug in the system"" for many of us. Stay strong, friends.

I find the community here to  be helpful and good. I just want to talk about it with others who get what we're going through. I'm a recovering alcoholic/addict. Been clean and sober for 3 years but I have also been on kratom for almost all of those 3 years. I'm so so tired of the negative effects it has on me. Especially the lowered libido. I often take too much in too short of a time and get really nauseous and feel awful until I close my eyes and sleep it off a little.

My life is by far in the best place it has been in years, maybe ever, and I'm not enjoying it or showing as much gratitude as I could because I'm always under the influence of kratom. Rarely does it even give me the buzz I want anymore and yet I still try to chase it.

In a huge moment of motivation I tried quitting CT about 6 months ago. Made it like 40 hours and the WD was so bad I decided to try tapering. I did a log book that I still use to record my doses everyday. My lack of self control with drugs kicked in and eventually my attempts to taper just morphed back into regular using again and it's been like that for the last few months. This time I'm going to CT it.  I am strongly considering subs if it gets to bad but I'd really rather not. I've taken subs before, years ago, to get high. It seems to extreme to me to use subs to get off kratom know what I mean? But I'm getting to the end of my options here... I could get subs and am considering just cutting them into small pieces (something I used to do because a full strip was too much and makes me sick) and take only a sliver of a strip each time the WD gets to a point of too bad. I can be sick easily its just the lack of sleep that really kills me. These are all just thoughts at this point. Haven't decided on a course of action yet and I would welcome the thoughts or advice of others. I used to take spoonfuls of powder and I realize now that I was taking WAY more than what I thought I was. Since my last attempt to quit I use only capsules now so it's much easier to track and ""control"" my dosing. I'm using between 60-100gpd currently. Before, with the power, I can only imagine what I was really taking I thought it was wayyyy less than waht it was. I never weighed it out. Probably over 150+ gpd frequently tbh. I know it sounds ridiculous but I really think so. I am hoping that the adjustment to capsules and taking less now with help my WD to not be as bad this time but I'm not banking on it. :/

I lied to myself about the hold k had on me. I lied to myself about how addictive K really was. I lied to myself that I had truly relapsed after almost six years totally clean. I lied to myself even AFTER I went to a detox to get off KRATOM and the second I got out I walked to the head shop and took a shot.

Six years ago my vice of choice was heroin, and boy did I love using needles. To kick that addiction I had to do basically a full year of intensive inpatient therapy, medical assisted treatment and a lot of humbling myself to become willing to change.

It wasn’t until a therapy session about a month ago did I realize, that for me… *Kratom IS heroin.* There are NO differences. That is how I have to treat it. All or nothing. Im either using or im not. (I know K can’t kill you like fentanyl but I’m talking purely in terms of mental dependence).

And it wasn’t until I applied this mindset that I was able to try again. And here I am at 27 days AGAIN. But this time is different.
I’m meeting with my therapist. I’m doing an IOP 4 nights a week. I’m getting medication monitored through a doctor.
I’m attacking this goddamn green demon FROM ALL FUCKING ANGLES.

I wanted my life back for so long, and I just couldn’t grasp it. I lost friends, I lost a wonderful partner. But things are coming back. I’m doing amazing at my job. I’m getting A’s and I’m on the Dean’s list again in college. This shit CAN be dealt with, we just have to make it serious.

If I can impart one piece of advice: treat your addiction to K as the biggest demon in your world, and your brain will focus on defeating it. Do EVERYTHING u need to do to get off K. Go to inpatient, go on subs (with a doctor), go back and stay with your folks WHATEVER! 

Just please, do what I did, and face the severity of your situation. Cuz even tho it won’t kill you in one shot like dope, living life as a Kratom addict is a miserable, sexless, loveless, emotionless existence.

Thank goodness I never got into hard drugs because this sucks enough. I've quit a 30 year pack-a-day nicotine addiction, 20 years of hard drinking and now an 8-9 year kk (that's what I call kratom) gig.

I take about 80-100 pills a day. So what is the gpd on that? I never measured it in grams, only pills.

Funny thing; I took about 8-10 per day forever!, and then I just started going for it in the past 6 months or so.

I have insomnia, the back of my knees and hips kill and I feel punchy, like my stomach wants to punch 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊 itself free. Or... You know how in old cartoons when a character would run so fast that he would leave an impression of himself in place for awhile? That's what my body WANTS to do.

Towards the end I would take KK just to stop those feelings--I'd even wake up from weird dreams and restlessness in the middle of the night and have to dose to fall back asleep.

I feel bummed. Sad. Bitchy. And none of those are my m.o. 

I don't like these withdrawals (big surprise). I've taken no precautions like many of you wise folks have, but I've ordered (like, 30 minutes ago) many of the recommendations I've read here--it'll probably arrive 10 minutes after I feel better.

My technique has been: chop wood, carry water, but it's tough because I'm bummed and lethargic.

I've decided that all of my addictions are because of one thing;
I am powerless over Sloth and my life has become unmanageable.
Everything I've ever taken that is addictive is something that gives me a ""reason"" to chill:
Sit down and smoke.
Sit down and drink.
Take KK and chill.
I also suffer from lower doses of gluttony.

I'm lucky though. For all the abuse I've given my body, I look oddly young, am tall, for a girl (5'10-ish) and am not in any way over weight, in fact I'm super fit looking. It seems that my 2 prominent deadly sins haven't physically evidenced themselves...yet.

I'm hyper by nature so these ☝️choices are rather odd. Why wouldn't I have chosen uppers?

Anyway. Thanks for listening. Best of luck. I'm rooting for you. Also, what was my gpd?

The biggest thing that is giving me anxiety through this process is just not knowing how long it will take to PHYSICALLY feel better. I know not everyone has answers and it’s always different, but I keep reading here people saying that they “still feel like shit” 30+ days out. I’m making this post because I’m hoping y’all can tell me that “feeling like shit” doesn’t necessarily mean physically. 

I’m scared to death also because I am getting married in July and I don’t want to feel like garbage for my wedding - part of the reason I want to get off this garbage is so I can enjoy my day for real!

I feel MUCH better than the first five days, but I still just don’t feel great. I have no desire to use, other than wishing I could “just get back to normal” even though I know logically kratom did not equal normal.

I can deal with mental stuff. I am ready for the mental stuff. 

How long did it take for your PHYSICAL symptoms to really go away? 

I know this question gets asked about a million times per day but I just need to hear it again right now.

Thank all of you beautiful people. I couldn’t have gotten this far without this community.

EDIT: I am sorry, I forgot my dose info:

Tramadol for 10 years (prescribed when it was “non-addictive” and I could fill it whenever I wanted) and used kratom to “quit” thinking it was a safe/miracle remedy. I hate how all of these issues are due to false promises. 

Used three-letter forty five shots for an unsure amount of time, 1 ish per day or every other day for a while but definitely got up to 2-3 shots per day for 3-5 months or so.

2022-02-24 18:29:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/t0onpn/my_easiest_ct_experience_so_far/,My Easiest CT Experience So Far," Like many people here, I have attempted to quit more then a few times in the past, so I knew what to expect. I am currently on day three after a 40 gpd habit (3.5 years), which has always been the absolute worst day for me but today I feel relatively normal. I am going to share how that was possible *for me*.

First step was vitamin C. I had read all of the accounts of vitamin C taking away a great deal of the withdrawal symptoms so this is what I got: Dr. Mercola Liposomal Vitamin C from Amazon. I started taking it a few days before I quit, and now I take 5000g every three hours (10 pills). This has absolutely been a game changer. It took away about 75% of the withdrawal symptoms that I have experienced in the past. It doesn't help with the anxiety or depression, but I will address those next.

Second was to get some Clonidine from my doctor. I told him that my company had laid off 1/3 of our work force and my workload has tripled in the last few months. I explained to him that I was having mild panic attacks, and couldn't sleep. I also mentioned that I didn't want to mess with benzos, and a colleague told me he takes clonidine for the same reason and it helped immensely. Since it's not habit forming and very safe, his attitude was ""sure, why not"". This completely took care of the anxiety and another 10% of my overall withdrawal symptoms. It also helped me sleep.

Finally, I got some Nature Made Sam-e Complete 400 mg. This is basically an over-the-counter anti-depressant. I started taking one every day about two weeks before I quit, and then two a day through my quit. The depression has been very manageable thanks to these. Every once in a while I'll get sad that I don't have a high to ""look forward to"" but I just remind myself that I wasn't actually getting high from it anymore anyway.

There are a few symptoms that I haven't resolved yet. The first one is my digestion. I can't really eat anything without getting horrible gas and bloating. The diarrhea hasn't been terrible so far but the gas has been awful. I also have zero appetite (which may be why I'm not having diarrhea).

All of these things put together have taken care of 90% of the withdrawal symptoms I've experienced during past quits. I took this week off because I was expecting the hell that we are all familiar with but honestly, I probably could have worked through it.

I wanted to share my experiences to give back to a community that has helped me so much through this garbage. Hopefully my research and my trial and error will help someone out there. Embrace the suck quitters, and ask me anything.",13,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.583074688911438}"

I was the same way for many of my quit attempts over the last 2 years. Attempting to jump off at 20GPD because I would randomly get the impulse to quit or become disgusted in myself. This can work for some but often times being too hard on yourself can have the opposite effect of what you intended. Creating a schedule and holding yourself to something that makes progress but doesnt cause debilitating withdrawal symptoms can make quitting a much more bite sized and manageable decision. Attempting to handle work, relationships, productivity, and general life while going through full blown withdrawal can be incredibly discouraging. In my experience withdrawal coupled with a stressful life event would lead right back to relapse. It’s ok to go easy on yourself. My experience is not everyones and some can handle CT. If you’re in the type of situation where multiple CT quit attempts resulted in relapse I’d recommend looking into a taper schedule. The tapering advice in this subs sidebar is exceptional and anyone who’s curious should check it out. I’m about 3 months sober now and hardly experienced any withdrawal symptoms other than stomach sensitivity.

I came here in hopes of being part of a community of people who are currently struggling with addiction to kratom and want to change. This will be long, fair warning. My relationship with opiates/opioids started when I was about 18 when my brother got his wisdom teeth taken out. I was roaming around the house late at night, bored and say two prescription bottles next to the sink. I pick them up and one said hydrocodone and the other oxycodone. A bit much for a 15 year old after a minor surgery but nonetheless I proceeded to pop a few and take some for later. The next few days were pure bliss. All of my anxiety and feelings of inadequacy immediately disappeared and I realized I liked painkillers, a lot. I would take them recreationally at parties and when friends had some but I wasnt an everyday user by any means. Fast forward to a few years ago i was working two jobs and a good friend of mine uses subutex and usually had some on him. I had tried it before and just got really sick. But I was so burnt out from work I wouldve done anything for a little pick me up. So i tried a little and killed it at work and could get so much done when i was on it. So I kept taking it until I had to use everyday to not get sick. I tapered myself off of the sub but I used kratom to help planning on just tapering from kratom also. 3 years later here I am. Thousands of dollars down the drain and I feel like shit about myself. Of course I started with the kratom powder but took so much I needed something stronger and went with the extracts. I told myself I would just stop taking powder and taper off the extracts (I realize this was a really dumb idea and was just a way for me to rationalize not giving up the extracts) so now I'm spending hundreds a week on extracts.

I have a unique situation and it's frustrating because most doctors aren't familiar with kratom.

In January I went through a really rough breakup and had to move home. First couple days were very hard, but I was spending a lot of time with friends and family, and also drinking a lot. I am certainly an alcoholic and have tried to quit many times.

I received a prescription for naltrexone so that I could moderate my drinking. However, I was told I'd have to end my daily kratom use that had been 10-15g (sometimes 20+) for about 10 months. 

I did a pretty rapid taper over the past 2 weeks. I didn't notice anything different.

 On Saturday, proceeded to go on a pretty heavy drinking bender, as it was my first day kratom free. That lasted until about Monday. On Tuesday (4th day kratom free), I had the terrible hangover and anxiety that I've come to expect from alcohol benders.

However, my brother suggested I might be withdrawaling from the kratom, but I'm not sure.

First day after the bender (Day for Kratom Free) I was nauseous, but no runny nose/eyes, sneezing, or yawning.

Now it's just anxiety and depression. Also nightsweats. I fall asleep decently easily, but wake up often. I think I've felt the same with alcohol withdrawals before.

It's probably some combination of both, but the fact that I don't have any of the flu symptoms and that I didn't feel any different during a quick 2 week taper make me think I might not be withdrawaling?

I started taking Kratom after a relationship break up having read about it online. I suffer from severe anxiety and it sounded the answer to all my problems. Fast forward 2 years and this plant has sucked the life out of me. App my own fault as I have kicked the arse out of it. 
Now I take it just to avoid being sick and it's stopped even working. I am spending £300-£400 pounds a month on it. Right now I am on 50gpd. Made the first move and contacted a drug councillor and got the ball rolling to get my life back. I can't do it on my own as the anxiety I am experiencing from withdrawals is off the scale. Storage thing is the drug councillors haven't even heard of Kratom so I am unsure how they are gonna help. I have mentioned Gabapentin and something to sleep so hopefully they agree. Gonna take 3 weeks to get to this point so I am gonna try my best to get down to 15gpd.

Ive been a 5 year every day kratom user and ive managed to very slowly taper down to 0. I started taking kratom when I was on the way to my friends wedding and another friend asked me if I wanted to try this green powder stuff. When I asked him what the powder did he told me it basically made you feel like you had taken a Vicodin. I remember when I was younger my mom would give a Vicodin every once in a while when I had gotten hurt in sports. Needless to say I was in.

I got back from the wedding and made an order. It started as me taking it at night to relax after work and the gym. That moved to mornings and nights then eventually everyday. I would be hooked for about 2 years not realizing I had become dependent on it. Then I went on a trip to Japan and after a quick google search I found it was illegal in the country I left the kratom behind. For 2 weeks I could not sleep. Restless leg, restless body, feeling like I wanted to jump out of my own skin. I was a walking zombie for 2 weeks. 2 hours of sleep at night if I was lucky every night. only until about the second week in I realized it was the kratom and id been going through withdrawal. My thoughts were cloudy, had anxiety, depression, running nose, constant yawns, sneezing, cold sweats. It was terrible.

I got back home and what I think was PAWS started to set in. I caved and bought some more kratom. I continued to stay on the power for another 2 years. Until about October when I was so tired of being dependent on this garbage. I bought a scale and told myself ill go as slow as possible as not to go through any withdrawals. And thats what I did. I would drop about 2 grams every 2 weeks. Sometimes more sometimes less. I now have dropped to zero grams and am completely off as of this past monday. I do not have any withdrawals. It is possible. 

My advice for anyone that wants to/ can do it in this way is to be diligent. Get a scale, do not cheat yourself, and go as slow as you have to, whether its 3 months, 6 months or 8.",34,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989207983016968}"

I see going CT as the only option. I already decreased my intake during the last two days and today will be my last dose. Already had very strong withdrawels tonight and honestly I am afraid of the next days (or weeks).

Funny part is that my life is actually great, all I worked towards the last 5 years came to fruition. There is really no reason for me to be an addict ... I am so much looking forward to being free from K. 

I have magnesium to help with withdrawels, a gym membership with sauna and some weed. My plan is to do cardio until exhaustion every day, go to the sauna and then go home, smoke some weed and try to sleep. If I wake up at night I have a yoga mat for exercises and my clothes ready to take walks outside. I will download some podcasts and audio books for entertainment.

I am lucky to be able to take some days of work as well. My girlfriend knows everything and is supportive. It is really on me at this point. Taking again is NOT an option, no matter how hard it will be. I will embrace the suck and I will be strong. I have so much to look forward to.

Two years prior I quit from a year of 30+ GPD.  Those withdrawals were brutal, so when I stupidly relapses months later I only allowed myself to have 2-3 GPD.  Thankfully it made cutting the ties for good a bit more manageable.  

 I got my husband on Kratom 4 years ago for back pain.  Like magic it took his 20+ year back pain away.  I've noticed he started taking heavy doses as more of a stress relief after a tough work call than for pain management.  I knew he was addicted, and he didn't want to admit he was/is addicted.

The white lie:  We are going on a trip next week for 7 days.  I lied and said it was illegal to have Kratom in the Bahamas, so he would need to get off Kratom before we go.  It's not illegal, I just wanted him to get off the garbage.

The regret:  He started to cut down his dosage at the beginning of the month, and I'd say he got down to probably 8GPD from 20+.  He hasn't had any since last Friday and he is having terrible withdrawals, and his back pain is unbearable.  I feel awful because I know I introduced this poison into his life.  I regret not being honest and telling him I wanted him to quit because kratom has started to take over his life.  This has been the only thing that has ever worked for his back pain.  I'm tired of masking a problem instead of finding a way to solve it.  

I've got to come clean to him about why I think it's important he quits.  He is quitting for the trip and not for himself.  I know the moment we get back he will want to jump right back on.

What did you do to stay on track or are you still struggling? I find it very hard to stay on track, especially when the cravings come. How do you cope with the anxiety and depression? How do you deal with the RLS.

Maybe this is what it feels like to be bipolar. Before taking kratom I didn't really have issues with anxiety, lethargy, or depression outside of when events happened in my life.

But now I seem to be ping-ponging back and forth between these 3.

One day I feel fine and motivated to work, happy, etc, then the next 2 days I will have crazy anxiety. It even got so bad I went and downed 6 beers one of the nights as it just wouldn't go away.

And today I don't feel anxiety any more but I feel extreme lethargy. It's noon now and I've drank 3 coffees already but am still constantly yawning and can barely focus on anything with brain fog. I got a great sleep last night but that isn't counting for anything.

Then the depressive feelings seem to be on and off on certain days, but are definitely a factor.

Anyway, I understand this is all PAWS and not to get discouraged by the bad days, but it's definitely a rollercoaster. Especially when I'm still doing all the good stuff like going to the gym, meditating, eating healthy but it doesn't seem to stop the next day from being filled with anxiety or lethargy, it's all random.

I know not everyone has PAWS this bad by day 49, but if you are one of those people then don't be discouraged, it's still much better than dosing every day and watching your health decline slowly.

I was doing just 15gpd for 3 years, and I can tell how severely kratom messed with my body and mind.

First 4 days were the worst but I was still able to like.. enjoy things. Consume media whether it was gaming or comics or TV/movies.

Used to game like 8+ hours a day, and I recognize this is part of the process but elden ring is coming out and I don't wanna feel this way for it lol I want to be able to enjoy it

Found out that kratom has ssri/snri qualities, which makes a lot of sense as I was self medicating for those very reasons. Do not want to get prescribed those bcs I want to be able to cum when having sex w my wife. Have looked into dopamine reuptake inhibitors and I guess that's a possibility but idk if will go thru w it. 

Whether I do or not go on a DRI,  in the meantime I want to be able to like.. care about what I'm doing/be able to enjoy it. I've quit other substances in the past so I recognize this is just part of it, rewiring your brain to get dopamine from a non-artificial source but whenever I quit other substances I had other substances to rely on. Kratom is the last substance left so I've got nothing left. Not gonna go back to smoking weed cause I've seen a lot of positive results in quitting.

I’ve been on SSRI’s for about 6 months and the same goes for kratom. When I started taking the ADs(escitalopram) I didn’t take kratom too much, probably just once or twice a day with 3gs of one dose. But it grew as I started learning more because I’m a senior in High school and I’m preparing for University. I also suffer from ADD but I don’t take any stimulant meds.

Lately(last 2months) I’d been using 15-20 grams per day divided in 3-4 doses. I solved everything with kratom. When I was sad, I took a drink. When I wanted to clean my room I took a drink. When I wanted to concentrate I took a drink. And the worst was I told myself it’s just like coffee. But it slowly became a habit and I couldn’t imagine waking up and not having a drink. I even took it in school while telling all my classmates I have it under control.

But it wasn’t just kratom, it was nicotine too. I used to buy these nicotine pouches you put behind your lips and in ~3 to 5 mins you feel very relaxed and even “sleepy”. I used about 15-20 of these per day these past few days. 

But I realized it had to stop. So I stopped. I chose cold turkey because I believe it’s the fastest way. 
I feel again. I feel everything. Even my d*ck is back. On day 1 and 2 I masturbated in less than 15 minutes, a quest I thought to be impossible. On kratom it took even 2+ hours with no result. I’m so glad I quit.

The reason I used so long comes down to fear of withdrawal. I saw basically zero benefits/high/effect from K for the past 3-4 years, but fear of withdrawal kept me dosing three times daily. I’m here to tell you that having been through withdrawal following a lengthy habit, I wish I had quit earlier. Withdrawal sucks but it wasn’t as bad as I built it up to be in my head. You CAN quit. If a junkie like me can do it, so can you.

I found kratom a couple months after I quit drinking in early 2013 (I was a physically dependent alcoholic). It seemed like a “natural” solution to my anxiety and depression caused by alcohol PAWS. I got hooked quick. Anyone who says this substance isn’t physically addictive is out of their mind. 

I dosed with wanton abandon my first couple years. Just whatever I felt like. No measuring, a free for all. It made me sick often, and I even had a grand mal seizure I’m pretty sure was caused by K. Somehow, being hospitalized and having my license suspended (due to the seizure) wasn’t enough for me to quit.

About three years ago, I became worried about what the heavy doses were doing to my brain chemistry and I tapered way back. I ended my taper at 6 grams a day spread over 3 doses, and stayed there for years, always desperately wanting to be free of this awful muck but ultimately not being able to let go. I told myself it wasn’t a big deal because my doses were small. But I was lying to my husband by omission, which made me feel like garbage, and I still didn’t know what kind of damage I was potentially doing to myself.

For the first time in years, I had a real reason to take care of myself. A reason to get up in the morning and face the day. I quit nicotine, kratom and bud the day I found out. 

Those first three days were awful. I had chills, extremely restless legs, cramps/body aches, headaches, and the deepest blackest coldest depression of my life. Couldn’t sleep either. But I powered through because while I never managed to quit for myself or my own health, I was committed to not fucking up this baby.

After those three days, things improved but acute withdrawal lasted about 10 days for me. I’m now nearly 4 weeks clean and have some lingering depression, but that’s it. If I had known I could get through withdrawal while still working and functioning, I would have quit years ago. It sucks but believe me, 10 hard days is so much better than putting garbage in your body for 10 hard years.

I ended up miscarrying two weeks ago. I thought about finding a head shop that sells K, but I knew no drug in the world would numb the pain of losing that baby I never got to meet. That baby freed me from a decade of addiction, and I’m going to honor their memory by staying clean.

All in all, kratom withdrawal wasn’t as bad as I expected it to be. It wasn’t nearly as bad as alcohol withdrawal. I let my fear of withdrawal control me for so long, and I want people to know you can overcome this. You can quit, you are strong enough, and your life after kratom will be fulfilling. No more puking when you did too much. No more planning your life around doses. No more eyedrops. No more lying and sneaking around. You’ll still get bursts of energy on a random Sunday morning. Your favorite song will still give you a dopamine hit. You’ll still be able to handle social situations without that junk. You don’t need it. If a long term junkie like me can escape, so can you. You can rescue yourself.

TL;DR 10 year habit, quit when I got pregnant, lost the baby but stayed clean. You can do this shit too.",92,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9943769574165344}"

It felt like I was walking through mud. After I quit totally this past Sunday I also had so really gnarly GI issues. I won’t get too specific.

When using kratom our sensation is totally lessened, we can still feel but our senses are dulled so hard. For that very reason Kratom takes away the *desire* to do anything because it’s not as exciting or enjoyable as it used to be. My example is video games and being in nature— at least at the 30 GPD mark >!30GPD+ is like moderate heroin level withdrawals!<

The flu-like symptoms I have with CT withdrawals always come with the chills first— they really are not that bad on their own right away it’s just like this feeling of you’re both a little too hot and a little too cold at the same time. A realization I had about this is our sensations are dulled so much that when we develop our full sense of touch by not having kratom in our system our chills are literally each skin cell individually screaming at how intense feeling is. It’s an adverse reaction of our body freaking out at how overstimulating sense of touch is.

2022-02-23 07:59:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/szgvph/hey_you_just_calm_down_helpful_tools_to_help_with/,Hey you! JUST CALM DOWN!!! (Helpful Tools to help with Anxiety and Insomnia during Withdrawal),"Good Morning r/QuittingKratom ! As most of us know, the majority of people quitting Kratom will experience a period of sleeplessness (or very little sleep that's often broken-up). Insomnia can be very frustrating, to say the least. Functioning during this period of our recovery often feels hopeless. Rest assured, **you're going to be ok**. You may feel like you're not going to survive on little to no sleep - you can. But when you're ""in it"", that knowledge doesn't feel very comforting. 

The anxiety caused by withdrawal symptoms (of which Insomnia and RLS, Restless Legs Syndrome, are probably on the top of the list for us) can feel overwhelming. Think of this vicious cycle: We have anxiety from acute withdrawals and we're exhausted. We just want our body to be able to RELAX. We can't fall asleep, which aggravates the anxiety even more. The heightened anxiety makes falling asleep that much more difficult. And around and around in a circle it goes. **The more we try to fall asleep and can't, the more anxiety we feel. The worse the anxiety, the less chance of sleep.** It can be maddening! 

As a side note, many Kratom quitters find that supplements and prescribed meds *can* help. Some don't (or don't want to go that route). Others find they only help moderately. But that's not what this post is about. (You can find more information about recommended supplements and helper meds in our subreddit's [Beginners Guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/7p0qx2/read_this_first_if_youre_new/).)

Even if we can't sleep, we just want to be able to RELAX, at the very least. Ever have someone tell you, ""Hey man, JUST CALM DOWN!""? (And they're screaming at you from the top of their lungs.) You respond with something like, ""If I could calm down, I would! And you f'n yelling in my face isn't helping! YOU CALM DOWN!"" The other guy says ""No! YOU CALM DOWN!"" And around and around it goes. That's what it feels like during WD. Our minds and bodies are screaming at us, and we just can't relax. We just can't ""calm down"".

My suggestion is to **JUST GIVE UP ON *TRYING* TO SLEEP.** Sounds crazy, right? Quite often, once we ""give up"" and **accept** a situation or circumstance, it no longer feels like as much of a problem to us. Am I saying to accept that you're never going to sleep again? No, of course not, silly rabbit! **YOU WILL SLEEP AGAIN.** What I'm suggesting is to stop fighting a situation that you don't have any control over. The body (and mind) is in withdrawal. Can't change that (unless we use, and we're determined not to use, so that's not an option). Can't fight it. Well, you can try, but it's a losing battle. So why not just attempt to accept the situation the best you can. Anxiety and Insomnia can continue for as long as the body and mind is in withdrawal... whether we approve of it or not. 

So, let's get back to *trying* to relax. Not fighting the anxiety, but just being able to ""calm down"" just enough so that the guy who's yelling in our face (Withdrawals) calms down just a bit. When he calms down some, so do you. The calmer you get, the calmer he gets. As stated before, **acceptance** helps... A LOT. Me personally, I usually don't start accepting a situation until I'm just too tired of fighting it. So stop fighting. A war (Withdrawals) will always continue until the fighting stops. So call a ""cease-fire"" with the war happening in your body and mind.

I've also found that breathing exercises and meditation helps. [Wim Hof Method breathing exercises](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/7si4ui/the_wim_hof_methodan_awesome_little_set_of/) (and cold showers) is talked about a lot on this subreddit, and for good reason. It really helps a lot of us. His [10-minute guided meditation / breathing exercise] (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2WKxL9enbZRWkyRNWqu9-G65-aIG4Dr1) is available on YouTube in 28 different languages for free. There's also a Wim Hof Method subreddit at r/BecomingTheIceman if you're interested. I find that just 10 minutes of doing this type of breathing helps me immensely to relax. Others find it actually stimulating, so your mileage may vary. But I think regardless, it does tend to help the practitioner to ""calm down"" just enough to relax enough to ease some of the anxiety. There's science to back it. Will everyone who practices these exercises finally fall asleep? Probably not. Some may. I have at times. But remember, our mindset has changed and we're no longer *trying* to fall asleep. We've **accepted** that we're just not going to sleep for awhile. Calming down a bit is the new goal. Try 3 rounds of WHM breathing. If it makes you uncomfortable or heightens anxiety, stop. Make sure you're doing it properly. But also know, although it can help most people, for a few it may not.
 
Another useful tool a lot of us have found is guided meditation and / or sleep videos. Put on [something like this](https://youtu.be/nkkJgdiR8IA) in the background (don't stare at your phone, put the phone down). Use comfortable ear buds, lay down, get as comfortable as you can possibly get (regardless of how bad the RLS may be), close your eyes, and just listen. This particular video uses [Binaural Beats](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/8jhh76/binaural_beats_for_improved_mood/). I used these types of videos a lot during the acute phase of withdrawal. I didn't fall asleep every time, but it did help just enough to calm down the anxiety so that I could relax a bit.

Think i gave myself myself heavy metal poisoning. Im good now after a month. 


Hello everyone first off let me say im so grateful for this sub for helping me through this. Im your typical goof who finds something I like and mess with it for a while till i have a reason to stop. Enter my curiosity for a legal “safe” high and I discover kratom extract shots. The ones that have the name of a baseball glove. 

Cue the typical shot abuser story: take them every 2 weeks, then every weekend, then take them every other day, then 2 shots everyday. The thing is though, this was during a span of 3-5 months. With the last month being when i took them the most. Thats was the only time I considered i really “abused” them. 

Oh yea, when i first took the shots i was able to gulp down 3 at a time with a tallboy and be chilling, faded asf. Until a few more times then i would get nauseous and the spins like crazy, generally not feeling good. This was during the first months on them when id take 3. After those bad seshes i just took 2 per day anytime after. 

Still though i never had withdrawals until i was taking 2 a day for the better part of the week on the last month, I noticed after finishing half a case of 12 shots i was getting tension in my temples when the kratom wore off, ignored and finished the case and when that was done i was having symptoms of kratom withdrawal

-fatigue 
-dizzy spells
-muscle spasms
-headaches 

After a week and a half the symptoms lessened , i say lessened now cause ik how long it took me to feel normal (a month) but back then i thought they where gone. So when i felt the symptoms less i bought another case and was taking my usual 2 shots until it was done. This is where my nightmare symptoms began

-extreme fatigue (was in bed by 6pm)
-feelings of vertigo all day
-pins and needles on limbs
-large muscles would spasm randomly though out day 
-flaky skin
-looking at my phone hurt my eyes
-horrible stiff neck
-8/10 headache all day

The first 1.5 weeks where absolute hell and it wasnt until week 3 where i noticed improvement. After a month a now i only get slight tension ache/stiff neck. But im one week in to quitting thc after being on it for two years so thats expected, it’s nothing like those kratom wd’s, i can tell

Now i say i had metal poisoning mixed with kratom wd because after many research on here i dont see ppl who used for the short amount of time and 2 shots per day like i did, yet I experienced these debilitating symptoms that ppl who down half case every other day for a year do. Anyways, havnt had any cravings bc i really don’t ever want to feel like that again. Ever.

I read a lot of stories and advice on this sub while going through some bad nights, so I wanted to share how I kicked the habit in case I can help someone out.

30 g per day user for four years. I tried to quit several times cold turkey but had horrible RLS and would be up all night just to cave at 3 AM with a massive dose out of desperation. 

I finally decided on a strict taper with capsules once I got down to 20g per day, by keeping a tally on my phone of exactly how many capsules I took per day. 100% honesty.

Starting at 20g I took one capsule less per day, until my RLS would start acting up at night… then held there until it started feeling somewhat normal. This usually took about 4 or 5 days, but sometimes longer. Once I leveled off I started dropping one cap per day again. At first I tried sticking to a rigid calendar-type plan but found I needed to pay attention to the withdrawal symptoms to gauge my dosage instead. I did 4 doses per day, saving slightly bigger dose for bedtime.

Once I was used to 20g, the whole process took 8 weeks. I had 1-2 week plateaus at 10g, 7g and 4g.  The RLS was just as bad or maybe worse towards the end because I didn’t have a 3g+ dose for bedtime anymore. 

After about a week at 3g my city shut down for a week due to a snowstorm so I had no options other than to stick it out. Even jumping off at 3 grams per day my RLS was pretty bad. I didn’t sleep the first 2 nights, then got about 2-3 hours the next 3 days.  Finally had a night with no RLS as stores were opening back up on day 7. I still think about that snow storm as a sign that it was finally time to put an end to it.

The freedom of not needing to take kratom just to function during the day and to sleep at night is 100% worth the pain of quitting. Your future self will thank you!

Looking for the best way to help / support my fiancé while he kicks this addiction.,"My partner has been trying to taper for about two months now, got down to a much lower dose that what he was using regularly and ended up being clean for two days. (Which makes me extremely proud, I know it’s not a linear battle). He was using copious amounts of extracts and had tapered to very small amounts of powder (that he asked me to actually hide from him a few days ago) 

I was under the impression it had been four days clean. Either way. Two days is good tho and a show of effort. But regardless, I found out he’s searching for something stronger. Looking to purchase pills off total strangers through Reddit. (He started using Kratom to get off Percocet) 

And I found extracts in our car today when he was in a NA meeting. (First meeting he’s been to through the kratom journey).
I brought it to his attention (that I had found the extracts) starting by saying I wasnt upset, and he was immediately defensive and mad. Left, bought more and went to a bar to get a drink (very unlike him to drink). 

I’m just very confused and sad as to why he wouldn’t just attempt finding the powder (or even just asking / explaining to me) if the CT route at this stage was too much. 

Once we were able to talk he was very self loathing, saying he’s a “junkie” and “all addicts are always junkies”. I know this isn’t true, he’s been three years sober before and I know he has the strength and tools to get well, to be himself again. He stated he “just doesn’t know if it’s possible.”I understand that mindset, I really do. I know it’s not as simple as “I need to quit, so I'm done"". That it’s a struggle and depression comes with this battle. One hour he’s ready, the next he doesn’t know if it’s possible.

We are expecting our first, a boy, April 17th, Easter. 
When we first addressed his addiction with kratom we were aiming for sobriety by that date. Though I’m worried it wont be the case. At this point, I just want to see him trying his best at that time. I want to know the best way to encourage him that he CAN get sober and that he will find light in life again. He's the most beautiful, talented and caring soul I've ever encountered. I miss the sparkle kratom has taken from his eye. The intimacy it has ripped from us. 

I just need to know the best way to support him. Any tips on how to approach talking with him, encouragingly with love, are much appreciated.

This post is essentially and update to that post... and a plea. 

In order for new and potential quitters to have a safe and supportive place to come to to quit Kratom, it's imperative that we only share OUR OWN EXPERIENCES with them and WHAT WORKED FOR US, as an individual. We, as a ""community"", have to realize that **everyone is different**. No two people are going to quit Kratom the exact same way. What worked for you, may not work for someone else. What didn't work for you, may work for someone else. **Unless it is dangerous**, we should allow people to do it their own way, based on their individual needs and circumstances. No two lives are exactly the same. 

For example, if someone posts about having a taper plan in place, is comfortable with that plan, isn't having any major problems with the plan, seems dedicated to that plan, has their own reasons for quitting the way they've planned to quit, why would I tell them ""No, you should quit CT now!"" WHY? You are not that person. You don't know exactly every detail of that persons life. The important thing is THEY ARE DEDICATED TO QUITTING and they are continuing to take positive steps in that direction. Just because YOU quit CT, doesn't mean someone else shouldn't quit by tapering first IF THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY DECIDED IS THE BEST APPROACH FOR THEM.

Now, if someone is having problems with their taper and are asking for suggestions and / or advice because they need to do something different because it's not working for them, then that's a different story. If you've had that same experience, then by all means, share what you did instead. Sharing the negatives and positives of your own experience is helpful. But to try to convince them to do it ""your way"" just because you *think* it's THE right way for everyone is, in my opinion (and experience), downright selfish, irresponsible, and needs to change in order for potential quitters to continue to want to come here for their quitting journey.

If they don't know how they should quit and are asking for suggestions, then by all means share what your circumstances were, how you quit and why you did it that way. Information is power.

As I stated in [the other post](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/swd0lq/a_couple_things_ive_noticed_recently/), try to speak from the ""first person"" perspective. ""This worked for ME."" ""**I** did it this way, and here's the reason why. You may want to / have to do it differently. YMMV."" We're dealing with people's lives here, not science experiments.

First full day off work, not craving kratom at all but feeling the expanse of time around me. You know, drugs and excuses go great together - I knew my murky swampy haze wasn't condusive to doing the productive things I could be doing at home, so I conceded that I'd do all those things when I was clean. I'd imagined I'd have more drive to do them now, like the 13 year old kid who *wanted* to indulge his creativity. 

I said yesterday that I'd do some reading (actual books for a change, not just Reddit), but I remembered about my journal that I'd put on hold for two years. Actually, I put it on hold for twelve years between 2008 and 2020, having written in some form or another since I was maybe seven years old. The longer it went, the less likely it seemed I'd ever fill in the gaps (especially as I'm not exactly a man of few words), but I bought myself a personalised journal and fancy fountain pen two years ago and got as far as summer 2009 before drifting away again. I have it all in front of my right now, and will get to writing in there as soon as I'm finished here. I would really love to have a full life story from age 14 (when I began documenting everything), so I've got plenty of catching up and all the time in the world.

Struggled to sleep again for four hours yesterday but I wasn't working so it didn't frustrate me so much. I also made the very easy decision to flush away the last of the weaker, fouler tasting strain of kratom I had sitting in my cupboard. Initially, I'd kept it there in case of emergency with the idea that I'd know I could microdose if the acute withdrawals were really bad. Fortunately, I read enough on here to know that this wouldn't work out - delaying the inevitable or just facilitating a relapse. It was nothing dramatic, I'd meant to do it days ago but kept forgetting.

I've been taking kratom everyday for about 2 ish years several more years on and off now. during these 2 years of straight use I've been everywhere from 10gpd to 55 gpd (y'all know how it is you keep increasing it as it has less and less effect) anyways I started taking it because I struggle with bad insomnia and the way I took it was one very large dose (I know that sounds insane, it's not as crazy as it sounds my family and I have some weird liver metabolism stuff where some medicine has reduced duration and effect) anyways at my worst I was taking over 50grams per night (honestly I lost track) along with other sleep meds like trazodone and anything else that would turn off my brain and anxiety so I could sleep. I'm in my late 20s and I've been experimenting and self medicating since highschool. 

Anyways a while back I decided I wanted to quit for good, mostly because of personal and religious reasons and for my mental health which has tanked. So here I am down to 15gpd and so happy to be so close to getting off kratom for good!

Dosage ticked up in the last couple of months of 2021 to where I was doing 16-20 gpd and felt really floaty and out of it, experiencing a marked drop in libido. 

After a painful, aborted attempt at going cold turkey the first few days of this year, I began tapering steadily. At first, it was extremely rough and I got very little sleep but I made steady progress (with this sub and its posters being very helpful, throughout). However, the past three weeks I feel like I'm in a holding pattern, averaging between 4-6 gpd. Every time I decide to drop lower or quit completely, social/school obligations or an inability to sleep prompt me to lose my resolve and I can't seem to continue on a downward trajectory. Additionally, I don't want to be a bedridden, short-tempered burden on my partner for several days (I'd already been sort of a drag to be around for 5 weeks). The good news is that 4-6 gpd feels a whole lot better than it did 3-4 weeks ago with far fewer withdrawal symptoms and sexual desire has returned. If anything, I feel slightly less exuberant/talkative/energetic at this dose than at my peak dosage level. I wonder if any perceived withdrawal symptoms of dropping from 4-6 gpd would be more mental than physical. 

On one hand, staying at this dosage level seems manageable; I don't really ""feel"" effects other than a small dose keeping me at baseline for 5 hours or so. Yet, the whole point was to stop using it entirely. I love to travel, doing so frequently before the pandemic, and traveling around with a Tupperware full of green powder, a scale, and a few little ramekins seems silly and burdensome. Any advice on how to take the last leap from a low daily dose to none at all? I probably have around 150 g left and it's hard to imagine buying more at this point, so running out might force my hand, I suppose.",4,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984527826309204}"

Benzos: Xanax and klonopin (prescribed). Helps time pass but doesn’t help physical symptoms.

Vitamin C( absorbic acid): Used it for a week in the beginning of the taper to get a sense of what a good dose would be for me. Found like 3 grams each dose was solid for me. Haven’t taken since as I am saving for when physical symptoms get worse. Really helpful and glad I did research on here.

Magnesium: been taking a single tablet once in the morning and once at night. 

Also have clonodine from years ago that I have not used and most likely will not.

I just went through covid and since I recovered, I feel that something has changed. My life values have changed. Suddenly I do care about things that I didn't before. And conversely, I don't care about the things that I considered important. I think that it is result of my therapy and other influences and covid was only something like a trigger of it all.

I have an addicted character. I had problems with drinking alcohol 14 years ago. Although I don't drink anymore, I'm addicted to kratom for the last 2.5 years (40 gpd for the last year and 25 gpd now). I had a chance to quit during covid but I wasted it and now regret it.

I'm looking for a job now. It's a very urgent problem that I need to solve. But I can't imagine going to job interviews during withdrawals.

I'd prefer CT, because tapering is difficult to me. I don't have enough discipline and I always return to the previous amount after a few weeks. My doctor recommended me a rehab for a minimum 4 weeks, but I can't afford it because of my urgent need to make money. And even if I started a new job, I still won't be able to go to the rehab for at least a couple of the first months.

The next problem is an easy kratom availability in the city where I live. I have a shop with kratom about 6 minutes walk from my flat. So even if I got rid of kratom from my flat in the past, I very easy failed, because it was enough to wait to the morning and buy it.

So I suppose I'll have to wait for some time and quit later in the future? I don't ask this question to justify my further using kratom, I'm sincerely interested in your opinion. My motivation is now very high and I don't want to wait too long, because it can get lower in the future.

So is there somebody with similar experience or any idea how to solve this?

Maybe, now, when I'm writing this post, I realize that maybe the only solution is tapering, no matter how many times I failed. So maybe I should ask how to successfully taper if I don't have good experience with it. I don't think technically, but in terms of discipline and perseverance.

So maybe there is somebody who found tapering not suitable but didn't have other choice and succeeded? If so, how did you do it? And what helped?

And I'm a half-century old today,"Good morning Quitting Kratom fam (as the ""kids"" say nowadays :) Speaking of feeling old... Today is my 50th bellybutton birthday. There was a long stretch, dating back to my 20s, that I never thought I'd see the ""Big 5-0"". Even as recently as less than 2-years ago, before I quit kratom, (with all of your help) when I'd wake up suicidal every morning and at the time I had no idea it was the kratom... until near the end. It's been over 600 days. But who's counting (I still am, I guess. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" is why I still count, as well as maybe giving others some hope that it is possible to quit and stay quit from this stuff.)

Anyway, for some reason I woke up this morning remembering how much journaling helped me, especially during the first year. I even journaled during my 3+ year kratom addiction (20-30gpd), but it was basically just to make sure that my daily amount didn't creep up too high (trying to ""control"" it, as many of us *think* we can do). At least I was in the habit of journaling already when it came time to quit.

Journaling has been so helpful to me, especially while [Tapering](https://old.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/) (for 7 weeks, jumped at 3gpd), during acute WDs and then during PAWS.

Nothing else special to report. Grateful to have the ""monkey off of my back"". Grateful I don't get cravings any more (although, the occasional thought does arise for a split second, but I'm able to quickly differentiate the truth from the lie). I can never ""successfully"" use kratom again (never could), nor would I want to even if it was possible. ""Once an addict, always an addict."" I'm just thankful that today I'm not an active addict. I consider myself ""in remission"". I know the beast can always come back if I don't remain vigilant and ""let my guard down"". It's no longer a daily fight to stay off of kratom - but I also know that my addiction is still doing pushups (staying strong) waiting for me to slip on a banana peel and ready to swoop in for the knock-out blow.

Have to make this quick. Im currently ~4 years on kratom with maybe 25-30g/day and am in the process of quitting.

The only problem is that i took on a new job as an accountant….and it is tax season…which means my company is requiring me to bill out 60 hrs/week at the moment + i am working towards my own dreams costing about 20hrs/week.

I am so busy and tapering has been brutal to my energy levels and focus and am fearful that my performance will be looked into at work (we have to bill out clients individually at the end of each day and they can see how long and how much we did/do)

Im so stressed and just wanted to vent and look for help. 

Any suggestions on overcoming the withdrawals/energy level drops? 

Ive depended on kratom for so long to maintain my overachieving nature and now all i want is to never see the plant again.

to repeat: I am tapering, but it is slow and I am having trouble maintaining the willpower. Tax season ends April 30th, and ill go back to 40 hrs/week but i dont want to wait that long to get my life back on track.

1. Anyone has experienced a rash from taking kratom?
2. If maybe since my detox started out gently and has become progressively more intense if maybe that's why it's worse and could clear up soon.

The acupuncturist told me that he doesn't do a hard-core detox but more of a gentle ease in detox so that it doesn't shock the system. 
I dont know, I'm just at a loss for why I have this rash. I have gone to the dr and they too said they felt it was a yeast infection under my armpits and again gave me cream for it. I have never had a regular yeast infection so I have no idea what one looks or feels like. 
The rash does itch and is red, raised and in a patch under my armpit. I have been keeping it dry as I was told to do and not been wearing Deodorant. I haven't changed any product use, soap, detergents ect.

He went through full withdrawals very similar to opiates if not identical. In the thick of it (days 2 and 3) 2 strong alcoholic drinks a day for 2 days helped relieve some of the withdrawals and helped him sleep, but he’s been drinking beer every day since. It’s just been 1-2 beers a day *as far as I know.* I’ve warned him about how easy it is to switch one addiction for another in such a vulnerable mental state, but he says, “he’s had alcohol around him his whole life, and it’s never been a problem.” I responded reminding him that he’s also had pills or other drugs almost his whole life to fill that void, so alcohol didn’t have the chance. I’m not saying he should never drink again, but he’s even admitted he’s using alcohol to feel better and relieve the pain that’s come back in his leg (and said that like it doesn’t just prove my point further).

I will be sharing more informational posts in the future. But this one is long, colorful, and cathartic…


I can’t believe it’s been 2 years. Seems like forever since I was hiding away, choking down putrid green swamp water every 2-4 hours. Shaking, sweating, in pure terror most of the time. Lying to everyone, lying to myself… and worst of all, believing the lies. It took me a while to catch on, I fell for the whole ‘non addictive harmless herbal supplement in the coffee family’ thing at first. But about 6 months in I knew it wasn’t true, and just couldn’t admit it to myself yet. 

When kratom first crossed my path it had been 8 years since I quit drinking and a year since I lost two close family members. I wasn’t ready to grieve yet, and I don’t even think I even knew how to at that point. Since quitting booze I had kept a very strict personal policy that if it wasn’t natural, I wasn’t putting it in my body. I hadn’t even taken as much as a tylenol in almost a decade. So the first time I saw kratom’s bright green powder and never ending claims of how it helped every ailment under the sun, I became very intrigued. Something about it reminded me of the strange orchid drug from the movie Adaptation, it felt like some secret botanical discovery that not everyone knew about. But from the beginning, a part of me questioned it. As I considered trying it I had a distinct thought of not wanting to take something that I would end up needing to feel normal. Little did I know what it would turn into..

The first time I tried it, I was swept away in euphoric bliss that wrapped itself around me like a warm hug. It was late in the morning on a spring day and when I went outside to work in the garden, everything sparkled with vibrancy and newness. Colors seemed richer, almost iridescent. Especially in contrast to the greyness of the recent funerals and uncharted expanse of the dark grief all around and ahead. I was happy, curious, & chatty. Oh sweet dopamine, how I have missed you! I couldn’t believe it, had I found some miracle cure to everything? To pain, sadness, to doing mundane work, to dreaded small talk or annoying tasks? At the time it felt so.

As the months went on, the sparkle quickly faded. But I continued chasing it. And the more I chased it the harder it was to catch. For two years my dosages became higher and closer together. And the more I took the worse it got. I became increasingly more anxious and battled constant panic attacks. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep longer than 4hrs at a time without waking up in withdrawals and needing to dose. I became hyper sensitive to everything and everyone. And progressively more sick and weak as time went on. I was skin & bones, my hair was falling out in clumps, and my eyes had become hollow and empty. & The grief I was running from nipped at my heels and would completely devour me once the dose wore off.

There I was, at the bottom of it all. In the mornings I would sit in the fetal position on my bathroom floor with the lights dimmed, knees pulled up tightly to my chest, shaking and smoking weed until my first dose kicked in. I could barely leave the house most days. I was a shadow of myself. It got to the point where I didn’t want to live anymore. 

It was here that I cried out for help. And I knew it could not come from a person, place, or thing.

Years before I had turned my back on God. But in the depths of my soul I knew that there was no one else who could help me. So I cried out to Him. In my darkest moment, from the fiber of my being. And for the first time in years, I felt hope and a flicker of peace. I began praying and seeking who and what this was. I learned so much and began cultivating a personal relationship and faith. I soon began tapering from the 40-60gpd I had been using. & The less i used, the more my faith grew. Over the course of the following year I worked my way down and did the final jump on Feb 18, 2020. I knew nothing about this subreddit until well after I quit. God truly carried me through the storm of withdrawals, paws, and repressed grief to the safe dry land of the distant shore.

Since then, I’ve become a new person. Along with the kratom, I was able to give up my other addictions to weed, coffee, and sugar. The depression and anxiety have lifted, I have joy and purpose in life again. I was able to grieve and honor who I had lost. My relationships have improved and my body has been restored. I have so much to be thankful for, and I remind myself of that everyday. And it is all by the grace of God. I’m not here to push my beliefs or tell anyone how to think or live. I’m here to tell my story of how I got free from the chains that kratom kept me bound with. And it’s impossible to tell it without giving all glory to God.",32,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9906138181686401}"

*SORRY for writing so much idk how to be concise.*  
random side question: I was reading some posts where people say they quit opiates CT but couldnt quit kratom CT which shocked me and really put things into perspective for me, if anyone has any experience with this lmk ive never taken any other drug but just curious.  
**Main Query:**  
I'm sure weve all be in the position where we say we are going to ""start a taper"" or ""quit"" but we put it off for so long that months go by well thats what happened to me I knew about this trip I have on the 28th of February 2022, for months and I could have easily tapered for 3 months even 1 month hell I ran out of k earlier last week for 1 day and I could have even stopped then but I ended up doing what I always stupidly do and put things off and I'd tell myself ""one last day"" and now theres only 8 days left till my trip and Im in a bit of a pickle. Im wondering if I should do a ""rapid"" taper from 16 to 0g in like 4-5 days which still leaves 3 days before the trip to detox or if I should just take it with me and go ahead doing a slow taper because I truly dont think I can handle another ct I remember I had one last yr that I stopped ct for 10 days and I wish I had left it there.  
**Backstory**:  
Recently I was taking 20gpd for months which was wild to me because prior to that when I originally first ever began I took 4g sometimes then didnt take any for days back in 2020 I wish I stopped then because I had no wd's back then and wasnt dependant sometimes I didnt even take it for weeks. Then summer 2020 I was up to 8g per day and when I stopped CT then I had flu like symptoms and diarrhea for a day but felt perfectly fine next day and I wish I could have told my old self back then to quit while Im ahead because it would get so much worse, then around autumn 2020 to autumn 2021 was when it got too much and a real dependancy I was at anything ranging from 12-20 gpd, sometimes 12gpd for a few months sometimes 18+ for a few months it varied and thats when I realised fk I cant quit ct anymore because this is too painful unlike when I first began and just had a flu this time it was everything you hear, hot cold flashes, anxiety, irratability and for me personally the two WORST symptoms out of them all (aside from the depression) was 1) The Sweating I just cant stand the sticky annoying feeling and 2) the skin crawling omg the skin crawling is so annoying it feels like youre in hell and theres no way to stop it aside from sleeping but its so difficult to actually fall asleep for me the skin crawling is the worst. I suffered from Restless Leg Syndrome for years prior to kratom so that isnt the biggest issue for me but it is annoying too. I dont want my 3 week holiday to be ruined nor do I want to be withdrawing and feel like Im in hell on a 8 hr plane ride altho if I quit 3 days prior to the trip maybe ill be ok by then.

2022-02-20 13:02:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/sx761i/long_story_if_youre_bored/,Long story if you’re bored,"Planned on taking a one month break and hopping back on, but hanging out in this sub made me decide to be done for good. You never know which comments or posts are going to really resonate with someone, so keep sharing because I keep taking screenshots of what clicks for me. It’s ridiculous how much kratom I had on hand, stored in my truck, at work, bedroom, kitchen, it was never out of reach. Even strains or brands I hated I kept on hand in case there was an emergency where I had to resort to it. I collected it all yesterday and it was easily $500 worth in a giant mixing bowl. Dumped it all in the trash and the trash man comes tomorrow. 

I’ve always been prone to addiction, it was nicotine and video games when I was younger, alcohol in college, then weed took over my life, finally found kratom and it was a secret addiction that no one really understood. My family was impressed with how little I ever drank, but it was only because I didn’t want to mess with my kratom buzz. I told myself that kratom was a harmless way to fill this hole of addiction that I have filled my whole life. I saw it as a godsend, especially since I joined the Army and it took away the temptation to mess with drugs that could get me kicked out. I’ve always thought of myself as very self aware, but somehow completely overlooked how much I was bullshitting myself. I’ve tried to quit kratom before and decided that I would just start drinking to dull the withdrawals. Turned into funneling 8-10 beers a night, on weekdays. Made it about a week then decided that kratom was actually a better alternative to that amount of drinking and hopped right back on it. The idea that I am obligated to be addicted to something just because I am prone to it is ludicrous. I felt almost normal last night and it was legitimately shocking because I had no extra substances helping me. I’ve been doing the mental gymnastics for my entire adult life of trying to decide what substance my body needs right now, could be caffeine, nicotine, kratom, weed, alcohol. I have been constantly calculating how long since the last time I did what and what I needed. The last three years it has been primarily kratom. Wake up at 0520 in the morning and immediately down 8 caps from my bedside table just to try to calm the overwhelming anxiety and grogginess. Feel like a zombie stuck in mud for 30 mins until the caps kick in. Go to PT and get half the workout I could have gotten if I wasn’t on drugs. Immediately take more caps after PT then 8-10 every couple hours until lunch. Immediately after lunch I’d take a couple huge spoonfuls of powder because the food would absorb the effects and I’d be desperate to feel normal again. Repeat powder doses until bedtime. Sadly I can’t even accurately say how man g/d I was on cause I just took it whenever I stopped feeing it and never measured my doses accurately unless it was caps. Spent about $450 a month and I’m guessing I was doing about 40-50 g/d. Writing this all out it’s shocking that I thought I had a manageable replacement for my addictions. The anxiety of traveling was intense. Stashing caps in Advil containers and checking my main stash, always worried about what exactly would happen if I had to answer for it in an illegal state. Not to mention going to field training exercises in the Army, constantly worried about keeping shit dry and trying to deal with raging headaches when I took too much or too little? Could never even figure out the shit because the same batch would effect me differently day to day. Finally got sick enough of it and hopped on this sub and decided to taper, started measuring with an accurate scaled and got down to 6 g/d in about 10 days. It was an aggressive taper but making it to 6 g/d was a lot easier than going any lower than 6. Painfully worked down to 2 g/d then finally hopped off. The pain comes and goes but the happiness I feel of not being imprisoned by that shit easily makes up for it. If I’m being honest, people on here complaining of PAWS at day 30 or 150 is a little concerning. But I’m willing to do whatever it takes, for however long it takes. The freedom of being off of it for even five days has been exhilarating. It’s been hard as shit, but I’m done for good. And I don’t need to replace it with anything.",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979725480079651}"

I didn’t see anything wrong with taking this plant for the rest of my life even. 

But I couldn’t of been more wrong.

I battle with all sorts of addiction. I started using kratom keep those at bay. While I feel it really helped give me enough time off heroin to be completely over it, it hasn’t succeeded in keeping me completely clean off other pills or drugs. 

I had a major life changing experience recently with my partner and some things have come to light. 
1) I would often get disappointed with kratom, leaving me feeling empty

2) It would keep me in a cycle of addiction. Use kratom, want more, use more kratom or eventually move on to something harder.

3) wouldn’t want to engage in anything with kratom before hand, again just keeping me in cycle of addiction. 

I can’t say that it has all been bad, but the time has come. Time to quit. I’ve been at 24-32 gpd for years now. Im quitting other things right now as well and I feel 100% cold turkey is a little too aggressive. So this is day two of wanting to only use 4 grams before bed as im already having a lot of difficulty sleeping.

The thing that slows me down the most is RLS waking me up at 2:30 - 3:30am.  I get it the worst in my arms and there is no chance I can sleep once it kicks in.  I just have to go find some other place to lay down (or stay up) so I don't wake my wife.  Other than that, all other physical WDs haven't been bad at all.  So I knew if I could get rid of RLS, I could taper much faster without much discomfort.

I've seen many folks post many solutions for RLS on this sub (I've been on for about 2 yrs) and I've tried some.  None have worked.  I saw a couple people post about magnesium glycinate recently.  It was also mentioned on a podcast that I listened to recently.  So I figured I'd give it a try.  I'm almost certain that its working like crazy!

I was on day 6 of my formal taper and stuck at 53.5 gpd because of waking up with RLS.  I started at 75 gpd and have used every single day for the last 3 yrs.  I mean, I don't think I've missed a dose.  So I started the Mg glycinate at 360mg (3 pills) before bed.  I still woke up because of RLS on the first night, but it seemed much less severe.  Same the next 2 nights.  It seemed like it certainly took the edge off, but not enough to prevent me from waking up.  On the fourth night I decided to try 1 more pill (4x120mg).  I slept through the night!!!  I've slept through the night since then.  In the next 3 days I dropped from 53.5g to 41.5g and plan to be down to 38g today...and with really 0 discomfort since using Mg glycinate.

To be fair, I also made 2 other changes at the same time that I added Mg glycinate.  BTW...I've been taking Mg citrate every day for a long time.  The type of Mg matters A LOT.  Anyway, one of the other changes is that I started taking Agmatine twice per day.  I dissolve a heaping scoop in water and chug that about 15 minutes before a sludge dose...one in the morning and one in the afternoon.  I did that on my last taper and it really helped me.  It seemed to make the dose last much longer which allows me to take less devil dust.  

The second thing I did was start Welbutrin that I was prescribed by my doctor.  I'm bipolar and one reason I use(d) kratom was to take the edge off of lows.  I'm hoping that Welbutrin will help take the edge off of the natural low that I believe I'm in now...not to mention the depression from kratom wd.  This kind of drug is supposed to take 1-3 weeks before it has any impact.  That makes me feel like it isn't contributing to why I am able to be tapering so fast right now with no real discomfort...but who knows for sure?

Its crazy how I'm able to be dropping 5 gpd over the past few days with no real discomfort.  I actually feel great!!  I certainly feel better than when I was at higher doses of kratom.  I mean, the first 8 days really sucked, but since then I've been crushing it and I believe the Mg glycinate is helping prevent RLS.  I know I will reach a plateau soon and have to slow my roll, but for now I'm taking what I can get.

BTW...I've always been a CT guy.  All or nothing is my nature and how I've quit everything else.  I just can't have a significant negative impact on my performance at work so tapering is really all I can do unless I take extended leave (at least thats what I believe).

**Quitting Kratom: What to Expect** (originally written and posted by betterdaysahead51, reposted by u/tip871)

edited (1/15/18, and original post replaced with archived post).

The most common question we get is what to expect when you finally take the plunge and quit kratom. While everyone is different, there are some common symptoms to expect. 

 
Day 1. Often a fairly good day. You're all revved up to quit and though some start to feel withdrawal symptoms immediately, for many it takes 24 to 48 hours.  

Days 2 - 5. These are most likely going to be the roughest days physically. The flu-like symptoms usually begin at some point after 24 hours and can last for 3 or 4 days. You may experience some or all of the following symptoms: Runny nose Yawning Sneezing Body aches Temperature fluctuations--hot flashes and chills Fatigue Insomnia Restless Leg Syndrome (it can also affect the arms) Sweating Nausea Diarrhea A feeling of heaviness in the body  
Important: The withdrawal symptoms are usually still comparable mild and short-lived for people who used kratom for -+ 1 year.  

Day 6 - 14 Though the heavy duty physical symptoms usually start to abate around day 5, during the next week there can be lingering fatigue, heaviness, insomnia, body aches, RLS, and other physical symptoms, while the mental symptoms of anxiety, irritability, lack of motivation, and depression begin to grow. Sometimes this feels like the toughest week because you've been battling the physical ailments and are worn down, and you were hoping the symptoms would be all gone by now. It's important to remember that you ARE doing better than you were a week ago, and that every single thing you're feeling is temporary. Getting through the first couple of weeks is a MAJOR accomplishment.  

Somewhere between Day 6 - 30 Generally speaking, this period is when the physical symptoms improve but emotional/mental symptoms can kick in. This is called PAWS--Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome, or basically the time after the harsh physical symptoms subside. Not everyone gets PAWS and the amount of time it lasts varies widely. Though we often think the physical symptoms are the hardest part, when the emotional/mental side kicks in is often when the real job of quitting kratom begins. It can be hard to differentiate what is PAWS and what is depression/anxiety, leading many to turn to anti-depressants and other medications. Symptoms of PAWS include: Attacks of anxiety Irritability Sudden mood swings Fatigue Lack of motivation Insomnia Inability to concentrate Obsessive thoughts Fluctuating energy levels Memory loss Difficulty in solving problems and thinking clearly Depression  

Day 30 - Day 180 Some people feel 100% better by Day 30, some by Day 60, and for some who used for a long time, we cannot give you a reliable information (!). ( We heard up to 6 months and more, but we don't know the upper limit ). The important thing to remember is that during this time, most of the days are good ones. Bouts of depression, anxiety, or insomnia come in waves, with less and less frequent and harsh waves as time goes on. As with every stage in the healing process, the most important thing you can tell yourself is that this, too, shall pass. No matter how long or heavily you've used kratom, you WILL heal and feel completely yourself again.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7823102474212646}"

Guide to Quitting Kratom Cold Turkey (originally written by betterdaysahead51, reposted u/tip871)

**Guide to Quitting Kratom Cold Turkey**  
&nbsp;

There are many reasons to quit kratom cold turkey. Perhaps you can’t stand using kratom for one more minute. Or you want the addiction and suffering from withdrawals over as quickly as possible. Or you feel you don’t have the willpower to taper. Or you’ve been tapering and now it’s finally time to jump. Whatever the case, you CAN be successful quitting CT.  

&nbsp;

PLAN OR DON’T

&nbsp;

A plan for how you’re going to quit kratom cold turkey is extremely helpful. First, make a list of everything you hate about kratom and the reasons why you want to quit. Then make a list of everything you want your life to be once you’re free of kratom. Refer back to these lists often as you go through withdrawals. Keep your goal in mind as much as you can.  

Next, research ways to help deal with acute withdrawals and PAWS (Post-acute withdrawal symptoms), such as natural supplements, exercise, meditation, yoga, and keeping busy both mentally and physically. Using your quit as a starting point for becoming healthier overall is a great idea. Clean up your diet. Exercise. Take up meditation. Focus on who you want to be rather than who you’ve been. No one wants to exchange one addiction for another, so know the facts and dangers about using any other drug to help with withdrawals. There are safe and natural supplements that may help with particular symptoms. Magnesium for RLS, valerian and melatonin for sleep, passionflower for anxiety, etc. Knowing these things in advance and being prepared with a plan of attack gives you a measure of confidence you won’t have otherwise.  

Sometimes, though, our lives don’t go according to plan. Personally, I planned to quit after I’d gotten through a particularly challenging week, but in the middle of that week the kratom I was using produced an unexpected and horrible dizziness that literally knocked me to the floor. As I lay there, unable to get up, I knew I had to be done. The moment I could get up, I grabbed all my kratom bags and poured each one out in the garden, then hosed it all into mush (and good compost!). Having a moment like that, a kind of “Goodbye Kratom!” ceremony is EXTREMELY helpful psychologically. It is your line in the sand, your before and after moment. Even if you only save a little bit of kratom for that last flush down the toilet or dump in the trash or garden, take the time to have that moment when you truly commit to leaving kratom behind for good.  

&nbsp;

ACUTE WITHDRAWALS

&nbsp;

When you quit CT, you can expect acute withdrawals to begin anytime within the first three days. In rare cases, even later, beginning on days 4 or 5. The most common onset of symptoms comes at about 48 hours. Symptoms can include: extreme fatigue, achiness, RLS (restless leg and arm syndrome), uncontrollable body temperature with heat waves, sweating, and cold chills, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, sneezing, yawning, depression, anxiety, and cravings. Fun, right? Not exactly. But the great thing about quitting cold turkey is that, although the acute symptoms can be rough, they are also generally over fairly quickly. Most people feel vastly better, at least physically, by days 4 or 5.  

The best way to deal with the intense symptoms of acute withdrawals is to accept them. Embrace the suck! To get to the life you want, you have to walk through the fire. So walk!! When your legs feel like lead weights, think, “OK! There’s that lead weight thing everyone talks about. Check.” When you’re lying awake at night, sweating and unable to sleep, think, “Insomnia. Uncontrollable body temperature. Check. Check.” Know that every single symptom you are feeling is TEMPORARY! I promise you’ll stop sweating. You are not going to be awake forever. Kratom loves to make you feel really, really bad just before it releases you from its grip. When things are at their worst, that’s usually when you’re about to feel much, much better.  

When cravings hit, have a response ready. For me, it was a physical shake of my head, saying out loud, “No!”, and then immediately doing something else. Think of the addiction like a child in the midst of a tantrum. Your best option is to distract him/her with something else. Get outdoors, run an errand, wash the windows, call a friend. Remind yourself that the cravings will come less and less as time goes on, and with less intensity. Cravings are the addiction talking, not you. Talk back to it. Go into your quit with the mindset that, from now on, using kratom is not even a possibility. YOU WILL NOT USE. YOU are in charge; not the addiction. Another way to deal with cravings is to have a support system you can turn to. Whether it’s a friend, a partner, a parent, a counselor, or even this subreddit, turn to the ones you trust when you’re dealing with cravings. Let the people who care about you help you through it.  

Your acute symptoms may last a few days or a week or more, but even if they linger, that is not such a terrible price to pay for a kratom-free life, for freedom and happiness and the ability to live without this addiction sucking you down. Remember this phrase: This, too, shall pass.  

&nbsp;

PAWS - Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms

&nbsp;

Some people don’t have any PAWS symptoms and others suffer for months. While tapering may help reduce the intensity of PAWS for some, this isn’t the case for everyone and in general going cold turkey seems to be the more preferable method of quitting kratom as well as the most successful. (For information about tapering vs. cold turkey, please check out   https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/wiki/index#wiki_taper_vs._cold_turkey)  

PAWS is an extremely individual experience, with some people feeling no symptoms, some feeling only a little “off” for a few days, while others battle anxiety and depression on and off for 6 months or longer. In very general terms, the longer you’ve used kratom and the higher your dosage, the more likely you are to suffer from PAWS. Those who have used for less than a year may skate through with no symptoms, while those who have used heavily for years are much more likely to suffer the consequences of some post acute withdrawal issues.  

In general terms, PAWS is more psychological than physical, and the symptoms tend to kick in after the physical, acute symptoms are over, or after tapering down to a very low dose. Symptoms include lethargy, cravings, depression, anxiety, and general anhedonia (an inability to feel pleasure). PAWS can be extremely frustrating because after you’ve toughed out the acute phase, you expect the hard part to be over. A month in, you certainly don’t want to be feeling listless, sad and anxious and still wondering what’s wrong with you. It’s vital to remember that NOTHING IS WRONG WITH YOU. This is just the lingering effects of kratom withdrawal, and while it’s tough to think you might still be dealing with issues months after you quit, it’s important to know that this is temporary. Every single person who has quit kratom successfully has eventually felt 100% “normal” again, whether that was within a week, a month, or six months. PAWS symptoms come and go AND they lessen over time. The depression you may feel at 3 months is usually nowhere near as intense as what you felt at one month. Keeping a journal of your symptoms is helpful for documenting exactly what you’re feeling, so that you stay aware of your progress. It’s easy to forget how far we’ve come when we feel like we’re not all the way home yet.  

&nbsp;

SOME TRICKS

&nbsp;

Remember quitting CT is 90% a mental game. There are no short cuts. Prepare for the battle and, when the symptoms come, embrace the suck. There is no way to freedom except through the fire.  

Research natural supplements, and use appropriately. Some work; some don’t. In the beginning, it may help to have something to reach for when you’re feeling bad, though over time you’ll want to work on living life without needing anything to help you feel better or escape. Make sure you don’t replace one addiction with another.  

Exercise, exercise, exercise! Ironically, the best time to exercise is when your legs feel like lead and you have absolutely no energy. The first steps will be hard, but moving loosens up that tightness in your body and increases your energy, and mentally gives you something to do. Move!  

Stay busy!! I can’t say this enough. Even if you don’t feel like it, go out, see friends, wash windows, run errands, FORCE yourself to get stuff done. Once you quit CT, IMMEDIATELY stop acting like the person you used to be. It takes six weeks to create a new habit, so start making it. Build new patterns. Fake it until you make it.  

Avoid your usual kratom haunts as much as possible. This includes the gas stations and head shops where you bought kratom and even your own house, if that’s where you dosed most of the time. Personally, I’m a homebody, but for that first week I spent most of time out walking, shopping, meeting with friends, whatever. I needed to break my usual pattern of dosing and getting back into bed.  

Have your answer ready for whenever kratom cravings strike. Go into your quit knowing that you are never, EVER, taking kratom again, so when the thought of using kratom comes into your mind, you can laugh at it and say, “NEVER!” Shout those cravings down. Don’t dignify them with your attention. Then get up and do something totally different. Keep yourself busy until the cravings pass. Turn to your support system—family, friends, counselors, this subreddit—for help.  
&nbsp;
Learn this phrase and say it often: This, too, shall pass.  
&nbsp;
Know that kratom always makes you feel your worst right before you’ll feel your best. Hang on. You are closer to the finish line than you think. Good luck!!!",11,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9781937599182129}"

One of the hardest things for me is explaining what I'm going through to other people. In the past when I've sought help from friends or meetings, I am usually met with confusion—it's hard to go to others for help and have them take you seriously. People either (1) have never heard of kratom or (2) know kratom but believe that it is a perfectly safe, non-addictive herbal supplement.

It has been immensely difficult for me to discuss how serious of a problem this is with other people. I've dabbled in just about everything in terms of drugs, and out of everything I've done—cocaine, prescription opiates, alcohol, MDMA, psychedelics, etc.—NOTHING has brought me to my knees quite the way that kratom has. For years I was stuck in a pattern of doing multiple liquid shots/day. That shit got pretty scary. Nothing has ever quite hijacked my decision making and personality like that like that. Kratom is the one thing that I truly feel powerless over and it's crazy to me that kratom dependency isn't more of a mainstream topic.

Now, I'm doing mostly okay. I relapsed a short while ago and have been struggling to get a sober streak going. It's partly hard just because of how widely available the liquid shots have gotten. I'm not quite in the pits the way that I was a few years ago but I am IMMENSELY happy that I just stumbled across this community today. It's really nice to know that I'm not the only person that's gone through this. Hopefully I can channel some of everyone's positive energy and get back on the sobriety train.

**1: No more freaking out your loved ones.**

You look sallow, pale, and gaunt. Your skin is grey, your eyes have huge bags underneath them. Little by little, your hair is falling out. Simply put, you look like crap. 

**2: No more hiding.**

Come on, you do it. We all do. Whether it's a nagging partner, kids, parents, whatever, you don't have to worry about how often you're ""looking for something under the sink"".

**3: Keep your money.**

This habit gets expensive. And, as drug habits tend to go, you forsake all others. No more being late for bills or overdraft fees because you spent it all on the green goblin.

**4: Pooping is fun(damental).**

Maybe some people are just too anal-retentive to admit it, but you can just resume living your life without epsom salt smoothies or ripping yourself a new one to pass a Chipotle burrito.

**5: You will (eventually) feel better.**

The way we've been supporting each other is amazing - I've noticed this especially in the Daily Check-In Thread, where the support and positivity is through the roof! Whether you're in acute withdrawals and just starting to count days, or have stayed quit for quite some time (maybe you're experiencing PAWS... or just want to spread some positivity), or even if you're still [Tapering](https://old.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/), if you haven't availed yourself of the Daily Check-In Thread, go check it out. Go to the [Quitting Kratom subreddit main page](https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/) and sort the feed by ""Hot"" and the daily thread will be the second stickied post in the feed. Automod generates a new post every morning, so you can check-in every day on the new daily post if you want. Thanks to everyone who participates there! 

Just a reminder, especially in the comments of regular posts, try your best to speak in the first person. Lately we've noticed that there's been some ""You have to do it this way"" or ""Withdrawals last this amount of time"" or ""Don't take such-n-such meds if prescribed by a doctor"", etc. etc. type comments. Please remember to speak of YOUR own EXPERIENCES. (i.e. ""This worked for me."" or ""This didn't work for me and here's why, but your mileage may vary..."", etc.) Everyone is different. Withdrawals can be different for everyone. Not EVERYONE has peak withdrawals at Day 3 and not everyone feels better by Day 7, for example. Sure, maybe a vast majority of us did to a certain extent, but that's not the case for everyone. So please share how it was for YOU. For those of us who've been here for a while, it's probably implied that you're *trying* to speak from the first-person point of view, but someone who is new to this subreddit or recovery in general may not know that and therefore might think these things are set in stone. Withdrawals from Kratom are not linear and neither is a ""recovery timeline"". Everyone is different. Every withdrawal can be different. And every person's personal path to recovery and staying quit can be different. 

Also, please be careful about giving medical advice or criticizing what someone's doctor or therapist is advising them to do. Just because your physician advised or prescribed something that didn't work for you, doesn't mean that it won't work for someone else. Example: Instead of ""Doctors who prescribe suboxone for Kratom withdrawal are idiots and just trying to get you hooked into the system....."", try commenting something like ""I was prescribed subs for Kratom withdrawal and then got addicted to that and the withdrawals from subs were worse than Kratom (or prolonged or set-back acutes), so I wouldn't advise it from my experience but your mileage may vary."" Something like that. We all have opinions, obviously. But let's try our best to stick to our own **experiences** here. (By the way, this is just one example. And also, the overwhelming majority of people here wouldn't recommend a ""stronger opiate"" to get off of Kratom, BUT it has been known to work for some if used in the very short term, in a very controlled environment and under a doctor's supervision. Even still, we wouldn't recommend it certainly as a first choice, if at all. So that's probably not the best example, but hopefully you get the gist.) When in doubt, please refer to our subreddit [Rules]( https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/about/rules/) on the sidebar.

Next, I'm happy to report that in the past year or so, **trolls** and / or active Kratom users who have no desire to quit that post / comment things like ""C'mom guys, there's no withdrawals or side effects from Kratom... You're exaggerating withdrawal symptoms... blah-blah-blah"" have drastically decreased. That's partly due to the Automod spam filters we have in place; but Automod or the moderation team don't always catch them all 100% right away. That's where you can come in and help us moderate this sub. If you see any posts or comments like this, or comments that break subreddit [Rules]( https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/about/rules/), or Reddit rules in general, please use the ""Report"" button found on every post and every comment. Do not engage in a debate or argue with them. (Not only is it a waste of time, it also diverts us from this sub's only purpose: supporting people who WANT TO quit Kratom.) In other words, ""**Don't feed the trolls.**"" Just report them and move onto helping the next suffering Kratom addict who wants to recover. This will further help us to help you and keep this sub a safe place for all those wishing to quit Kratom for good and all. Thank you.

Finally, I've been noticing a growing trend on this subreddit that concerns me... regarding CT (Cold Turkey) and Tapering. First of all, this sub does not promote or favor one over the other. We never have. Whatever works for you and whatever works for the suffering addict who wants to quit is the way to go. (If one way hasn't worked, try the other way.) Obviously, those with larger habits (100+gpd for example) would *probably* have better success by tapering. BUT, that's not necessarily the case for all. There's been people here who've jumped from very large daily amounts and have managed to successfully quit CT. Is it the norm? No. But it does happen. And those people should be commended and supported just like anyone else. It's what worked for them, and that's what counts. Not everyone has the discipline to taper (and that's ok) and not everyone can endure the withdrawals that may occur from quitting CT (and that's ok too). It's an individual choice and experience (again, speak from the ""I"" first-person point of view). Now, aside from that, what has really been concerning me is when an individual has quit CT and is already 3 or 5 days along, for example, in their quit and is perhaps struggling a bit but hasn't given up hope or relapsed, sometimes a commenter will suggest something like ""Just take 2 grams to fend off withdrawals (or to get some sleep because Insomnia is usually a major withdrawal symptom and sticking point for most of us) and you'll be ok..."" Or ""You should be tapering."", implying that the sufferer start using Kratom again and start tapering down, risking starting the entire withdrawal process over again, if not taking the risk of entering active addiction all over again. No!!! Chances are they are already close to entering the ""home stretch"". Suggesting that they consult their doctor perhaps for short-term comfort meds, or work with their therapist if they have one, or telling them about supplements that worked for you that perhaps they haven't tried is perfectly fine... or EXERCISING the best they can and trying to stay as busy as their body will allow them at this time... or practicing meditation or breathing techniques like Wim Hof Method... etc., is all good sound advice. Also, remember when ""Embrace the suck. We've got this!"" used to be a common phrase on this subreddit? I do. And I did when I quit. But remember, I'm talking from the situation of when a person is already in the throws of acute withdrawals for a couple or few days. Think about this: (And this is probably a terrible example, but it's the first that came to mind...) A person who accidentally sets themselves on fire, but did the ""stop, drop and roll"" technique that we all learned in grade school and the fire is 95% out... Would you offer them a lit match? OF COURSE NOT! You'd try to help them put the rest of the fire out and immediately call 9-1-1 for medical assistance. (Again, probably a terrible example. I'm sorry.) Yeah, perhaps this is a gray area for some. But we are trying to get out of the cycle of Kratom addiction and put this beast behind us for good. Remember to choose your words carefully. Relapse is unfortunately common, but it doesn't have to be the norm. Let's remember to encourage people that **RECOVERY IS ACHIEVABLE** and we don't have to live in the endless cycle of addiction any more.

this is my first time posting, but I've been reading on this sub during my whole journey of quitting kratom. I'm now on day 158 without kratom and I'm struggling. 

I was doing great from about 30 days to 130 days. I had some episodes of PAWS, but overall I felt happier than I've felt in the past 10 years. I think a huge contributor to doing so well was exercising. I was doing all kinds of sports and found out a sport I really love doing, which is bouldering. About a month ago I fell awkwardly while bouldering, which caused me to dislocate my knee and elbow. Since then, they're both in cast, and while my elbow is doing ok and will be out of the cast next week, my knee will need surgery and it will take months before I can walk again (and over a year before I can boulder). I have been feeling so depressed lately. The cravings for kratom have been increasing and I'm justifying the use of kratom because I feel sorry for myself. I haven't given in yet, because I really really really don't want to fall back into this horrible addiction; this is the longest I've gone without it in the past 4 years.

2022-02-19 05:51:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/sw7fgh/day_7_between_hell_and_heaven/,Day 7 - Between hell and heaven,"Cold turkey from 2+ years of constant daily use (average of four/five 1 teaspoon shakes, I never measured more scientifically), 4 years of nightly use, and a total of 12 years of regular kratom or codeine use.

The cleanse started out so much easier than I'd dreaded, feeling more like a semi-desirable/semi-undesirable experiment than a starvation - starvation being how it had come to feel if I ever had to wait a few days between batches. There was a strong, wholesome feeling, like the wellbeing you get after completing much needed chores. On the flipside, I was a bit scared of the present moment, frightened the most of the 'time prison' mindset of depression that thankfully loomed more as an implied threat than anything felt.

My battle is on two fronts - work and home, both with their perils as well as benefits. Work is where I went from a nightly user to a constant user - twelve hour shifts, four days on/off, in a security control room where I need to be able to stay awake and be focused in efficient *some of the time* while being able to chill out to entertainment much of the time. Kratom, with a high enough tolerance, did that - staved off tiredness and boredom without clouding my ability to think efficiently as it had when I was new to it. 

Then there's the days off. It's a lot of spare time, having made it very easy to drink kratom throughout the day - especially once the tolerance was sky high. Having to stay awake wouldn't be an issue here, but days also lacked the structure of a work shift.

I think today's work shift was the first one where I'd say it felt fine not being able to boost my mood or wakefulness on command. The first few really dragged, and going back to tea and coffee left me wondering how I'd ever stay up - luckily, I don't feel as tired. I only had two days off last week, I'll have five off this week, so luckily I'm a bit further along and starting to get used to the intrinsic gratification from activities rather than their enjoyment being determined by how much kratom I'd drunk.

Unfortunately, the insomnia has now kicked in big time - perhaps this is the rebound from my brain feeling tired all the time without kratom. I was up around 7am two days ago, worked in the evening, coming home at 07:30, went to bed at 09:00, then failed to sleep until about 3pm, netting me two hours of sleep in 34. I managed to sleep easily on my break, but have found myself again not falling asleep, despite having only four hours sleep over a 54 hour stretch.

If it wasn't for that, I'd say I'm doing remarkably well. I've had some lower moods, but honestly it all just feels like I'm in such firm agreement that I'm done with kratom that the scary part isn't there as I'd expected it would be - that being the itching craving that for me comes with moderation or the times in between usage. They might still be down the road, of course, the insomnia was a surprise at day 6 so I'm not ruling anything out, but so far it's been quite painless...until the lack of sleep.

If I was only doing this because I thought I ought to, rather than knowing I have to, I'd have fallen at the insomnia hurdle. I never thought I had strong willpower, but it feels like the decision making and determination part plays the largest role - setting the difficulty. I don't know how well I'd do staving off prolonged, relentless cravings, like some tower defence game. It doesn't feel that way thus far, because there's a joy and excitement from not being dependent anymore. I suspect I should watch out for this, because joy and excitement sounds like something that will naturally plataeu and then decrease as the new normal becomes the norm.

Anyway, thanks for indulging me. I got back up to smoke some weed, write this, and hopefully get some sleep. I'll look into the other insomnia remedies while I'm here.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9941421151161194}"

I switched strains and did white vein, and stuck with about 10-15GPD with the occasional extract pill thrown in. My biggest issue is the gym… kratom made going to the gym feel AMAZING, so my cravings hit the hardest right before the gym. 

I have covid right now, and it has been the perfect time to quit since I’m off work for the week. Currently on day 2, and return to work next Monday. I didn’t really plan this quit, but I realized no matter how much kratom I took I didn’t feel it because of how run down my body is from covid, so I was like “why even take this?”. This morning I woke up in a puddle of my own sweat… withdrawals or kratom? Who knows. Just glad to be home for this lol.

I know this weekend I’ll be technically “off” quarantine to where I can leave the house. But Im afraid of going out and getting kratom. Because the cravings are really intense. Plus I really want to go the gym, and I’m afraid I’ll be like “okay just one extract pill before the gym, and then tomorrow back on track.” So maybe I’ll just sit my ass home this weekend, and plow through the cravings.

What finally made me decide to stop making excuses and just quit the damn stuff was an impacted bowel from kratom. I literally thought I was going to die 2 weeks ago. Sitting on my toilet with sh*t stuck in my ass, I thought to myself “is this f*cking worth it??” No. It’s not worth it! All I could think about was how embarrassing it was going to be when I have to call an ambulance for this. That’s how bad it was, I thought I was going to need medical treatment. Luckily, I was able to get it out on my own but I am forever traumatized by that incident. 

My sweet sweet doctor gave me some Gabapentin to ease the process but he didn’t know how many mg to give me so he gave me 300, 100mg pills.

I am absolutely blown away by how much better I feel. I had gotten so in my head throughout my addiction that I was convinced that not only did I have severe mental health issues, but that they were completely unfixable and that's just how I was going to exist. As it turns out, that was not the case, the majority of my depression, mood swings, paranoia, and anxiety, were a direct result of using kratom.

Now that I've gotten past the majority of the withdrawals (still have an off day every once in a while) I've noticed that my personality is growing back, I'm starting to remember who I was before I fell into all of this. I'm drawing and painting again, I'm listening to music that I had completely forgotten about, I'm cooking great meals, and I'm generally happy. My world no longer feels like it's ending, which sounds dramatic but that's the best way I could describe waking up before my morning dose every day. At this point, Kratom seems like a distant memory, despite that, I keep it fresh in my mind every day that *just one dose* is how I got myself into this mess with my last relapse, I have no urge to go anywhere near the sludge again.

On top of all of this, my relationship with my partner is so much more connected and strong, and it gets better day over day.

It was not easy for sure, I wanted to quit for a while but was not able to due to the mental and physical addiction. I would tell myself I will not buy and use today but at the same time of the day I will still drive to the shop and buy a shot or 2. It was really hard to break the habit for me and at some point I thought it will be impossible. So what happened was I got boosted with COVID vaccine and the next day felt sick from it, what a perfect time to quit I thought and then the next day the snow storm covered all the roads on the way to the shop, thank GOD! Acutes + Covid shot illness lasted for about 2-3 days. I then had some massive cravings to dose for some time and still do but its much more manageable now. After about 4 days I felt ok physically however mental battle was just about to start. Some days I felt absolutely empty and depressed and some I was ok. Here is what have helped me with the recovery battle:  
1) Vitamins - Vitamin C and B12, Black seed oil  
2) Meds - Gabapentin, Clonidine, CBD oil  
3) Win Hof breathing (very helpful for cravings and overall relaxation), cold/hot showers  
4) Reading this forum especially when feeling depressed and helpless   
5) Music - its hard to believe but the music sounds amazing after you quit

To those who wants to quit but cannot I suggest to use every chance you got and try again and again, don't be 2 hard on yourself if it does not work right away, keep trying and don't stop. I also want to emphasize that my anxiety is much more manageable when I'm NOT on K which is surprising since this was the reason I was taking it. It may have helped in the beginning but its not worth it for sure going through the addiction and quitting process. Don't think of the WD in the negative way, the idea is, if it was easy to quit most of us people would use all the time, so this tough period will be remembered when you will spontaneously decide to do it again. You will most likely think twice prior to buying and getting into this mess again. Its much calmer and peaceful here on the other side, trust me. DO it and you will see for yourself.

Whenever I first started taking it it was for fibromyalgia pain and the mood boost, and I only took it once every couple of days when the pain was getting the best of me. Now 2 years later I take a dose every 4 hours and sometimes an extra dose before bed because I can no longer sleep without it. I get terrible restless leg syndrome and anxiety as well as sharp zinging nerve pains in my legs. A couple of weeks ago my husband talked me into trying a 9-day cleanse from it. The withdrawals were pretty crappy and about a week in I was ready to break. My irritability had gotten really heavy and I was just ready to find my bag and take a dose just to make everything stop. I ended up making it 9 days, reluctantly and then went right back. Now here we are a few weeks later and today I threw away my bag. I decided this morning that I'm just done letting something control me. Whenever I decided that I was going to try to stop I canceled my order with my vendor and they decided to send me a free shipment and credited what I paid for it back to my account. When my shipment came it was double what I paid for so I just felt like I was being persuaded by a drug dealer to keep coming back.. right now I just went my life back and I want to feel happiness again without having dose every 4 hours to get it. So far I've had a migraine all day, tension in my muscles, pain in my joints, fatigue and stomach cramps. I know that after the 9-day mark the last time I quit I really started to feel a lot better but that might have just been because I knew that I was going to be able to dose again on that day once my cleanse was over.. but my husband noticed that I was acting more lively and like myself again so I'm hanging on to that and hoping that after a couple of weeks I'll feel more like myself again.",26,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985076785087585}"

I'm looking for some tips on tapering.,"As the title said, I'm looking for some advice for how to go about tapering. I used Kratom to kick a pretty nasty pill habit. For awhile it was amazing, I barely withdrew from the pills at all, and Kratom was so much cheaper and more viable. But this was almost two years ago, now I am taking about 30g a day and I'm tired of it. I was going CT until today, day 3, when I finally caved. I have a job and responsibilities and the level of sluggishness and discomfort that I was feeling was not sustainable while continuing to perform at life. 

I have gotten tired of being dependent on anything. I have also gotten tired of always having to require it when spending time away from home, especially since one of the states to which my job often brings me is in a state where it is scheduled. If I'm at 30g a day right now, should I do 25 for a few weeks, then 20 for a few weeks, then 15, etc, etc? Is this too fast in your opinion?

Any opinions or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated. I plan to buy caps and begin capping it up to make my doses more measured, and therefore the tapering easier, unless somebody has a better idea.

How I started using Kratom:

I'll start from the beginning, I began using Kratom when I was 16, I'm 23 now, and it started off pretty light with my usage. At 16, I was working a job with people who were in their mid to early twenties who were raving about this stuff and I wanted to try. From then on I would go off and on for months till I was about 19. My real battle with it began when I was towards the end of my first year in college. I found a place in my city that would sell it for cheap so I thought I could really start to monitor my use if I only bought from them. I started to move my use daily, It would take me about a week to go through a bag (3oz) for the first 2 months. I know that's a lot to take, but I had been taking it for years on and off from that point.  After about two months I would stay inside most of the time, not even really going outside my room to talk to my roommates. My dose began to increase as I got more and more of this social anxiety and I would only leave my room to buy Kratom or go to class if I needed to. I was convinced that I needed Kratom for school, I thought ""if I was getting good grades, this must be helping me"". It was something that I felt no one was there to point out how bad it was for me, so I could get away with taking it as much as I could. My ex was long-distance with me so I could get away with her not seeing my usage most of the time. I began to have an issue with my body as well during this time, which I had been dealing with for years but the effects of this condition were the worst they had been in my whole life.  Long story short, I couldn't go outside much cause I would break out in hives every time I got hot(I have since realized anti-histamines do a great job of helping these symptoms). My insomnia had skyrocketed during my serious addiction as well. I couldn't sleep 3 days out of the week and would only be able to finally sleep out of pure exhaustion. Kratom was my lifeline for a few hours every time I took it, I had a burst of energy that could help me through whatever I needed to work on. The start of my breaking point happened when I missed one of my midterms for only of my last classes for the year. I had been so tired staying up the night before that I slept through my test.  My teacher( knowing me as a guy who was sometimes super engaged and sometimes super sleepy) emailed me back immediately to let me retake the test. I went to class took the test, and he pulled me aside to ask me why I was asleep for his test today. At this point, I was taking close to an ounce of kratom a day to stay awake and to feel just normal. I didn't say anything about Kratom, but he must have assumed it was drugs because he brought up the school therapist that I could start to see. Nothing changed after this interaction, but a few weeks later when talking to my girlfriend early in the morning, I had lied to her for the first time in our relationship about using Kratom that day or not. It wasn't something she didn't know about but didn't really ask about my usage up to that point. I sat there after we got off the phone and cried the entire time as I began to have this moment of clarity that I had a serious problem with this stuff. I called her back about 30 minutes later and told her that I lied, had a problem, and will not use this stuff again.

Actually Quitting:

I saw that therapist my teacher recommended to me that same day and was recommended to attend a substance abuse group he facilitated a few times a week. The withdrawals the first week were hard, my insomnia got worse, my body was sore all the time, and I felt sick every time I tried to eat everything. My temper and emotions were all over the place and my ex was here at this time when everything was hitting the fan. One day I woke up in an emotional place and just broke up with my girlfriend at this time. There are many things I'm skimming over here but I'm just kind of keeping it broad, cause our relationship is not what I'm here to talk about.  Quitting was an emotional time for me cause I felt like such a failure to my family. I come from a family where I've lost many members to drugs, and I've always known how much I have a predisposition to it. The group meeting was the only thing I looked forward to for a few months, I forced myself to get back into working out and force myself to do something every day. After a couple of months, I began to feel like myself again but continued to go to the group for about a year after I quit. I honestly would probably still be going if I found a  new group where I moved up to but I never did. I still talk to a therapist, but going to a group surrounded by addicts all trying to change was inspiring to me. It's been about 2 and a half years since I last used and I'd be lying to you if I still didn't think about it. My eyes are still glued to a sign I see for Kratom on the street, but it got easier the longer I stayed away from the stuff. I still have things I need to quit in my life like nicotine, and I hope one day to kick all addictions from my life. I just want you people to know that you can get better and you can eventually quit. The path for recovery looks different for every person you meet and sometimes cold turkey like me is not something that works for everyone. That's not an excuse for doing it again, but Kratom is a natural opioid and has a similar withdrawal to other lab-made pain killers like oxycontin, so withdrawals are intense and can be a lot for people. Make sure you stay hydrated if you plan to quit, let people who care about you know what you are planning to do, and hold yourself accountable to those who you tell. It's been two and a half years for me and I still consider myself an addict, but I'm better and I'm gonna keep trying to stay healthy for the rest of my life.  I hope this post helps at least one person out there but was also meant as a form of catharsis for myself. I write my emotions out a lot nowadays and it helps me find what I'm truly feeling at that moment.

I am lost, as a human, as a soul. My personality has been eroded into a husk of the man I once was. I chose kratom over my girlfriend, my social life, my creativity, and my hopes and dreams. The feeling that kratom gave me was so much better than everything else. It stood in the face of depression and anxiety, beasts I've been carrying since I was 10 years old, and turned them away. Those deep and thorough panic attacks? Vanquished. Those flash-bulb images of nooses and blades and guns to my head? Thrown aside.

I'm so scared. I'll have to feel those things, in a new place with people I don't know, without kratom. I'll have to feel those things all the time. My brain tells me that this is going to end with me dying, alone, unable to cope with these oppressive feelings. The pit in my chest tells me to stay here, at home, with kratom, where I can be in comfort, those feelings unable to pass the moat of green sludge. But what kind of life is that?

I’m doing well this time and have minimal symptoms (mainly leg aches and RLS) due to vit c and I’m terrified of making things worse but this cough is miserable and stopping me from sleeping.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9957714676856995}"

Became very addicted in 2015. Started out taking a 1/2 oz of powder in a dose and quickly moved to the full ounce in one drink. From there it escalated to 60 GPD and over the years to God knows how much... guessing 120-140 GPD. Then came the kratom extracts in 2018. I stayed on those shots until Dec 2021. It ruled my life. I would take anywhere from 3-5 shots in a day, often with capsules to boost it. I lost who I was. Motivation was gone. Only motivation was to work and make money so I could get high... I stopped being able to write good songs most of the time... though if I was nice and high sometimes we would get something cool on tape... Most of my money went to those fucking shots. I could have bought a new house with the cash I spent. Or bought a tour van and a big music studio with top of the line gear which has been my dream for years. Instead most of my money went to kratom. 

In Dec 2021 I was on the way to my mom and dad's house in North Carolina. Driving from the Florida panhandle. I took 2 opms shots by the time I reached Atlanta. Once I got thru ATL I told my girlfriend I was feeling weird and needed to pull over. I felt like I was dropping out of consciousness In levels and my vision was blurring. I got off the interstate and made it to a gas station. I then got out of the car and fell out in the parking lot. I woke up out of that about 15 to 30 seconds later, stood up and told my gf to call an ambulance.
On the ride in the ambulance I started feeling awful again. My heart rate was all whacked out. I thought I was dying and actually started accepting my death. I was having slight hallucinations (ambulance window waving and moving towards me which was weird, kinda like mushrooms or something) and I was pale as a ghost and sweating profusely. The EMT stabilized me with fluids. I told him I had taken kratom and that's the only drug I take, which is true. We got to the ER, they rushed me in and did tests. Then my gf showed up in the room. I then felt weird again and lost consciousness except for being able to feel my girlfriends hand in mine. I couldn't see anything. I held onto her hand and that's all I remember. I came out of it and they said my heart rate had gone from 150 to fucking 50. It was so strange. After the nurses had rushed back in during the episode and ran more tests they admitted me for a night. All my results came back without any problems. 
I can't explain what happened to me. I had been having chest pains for a few days before it happened. 

I still have slight chest pains and it's almost been 2 months since this happened. 

Has anyone experienced anything similar??

I dumped all my kratom at my parents house and haven't touched it since. Thankfully I was with good people and so quitting cold turkey was not bad at all. I didn't have many WD symptoms at all. I remember what it was like coming off IV painkillers when I was in my early twenties and this was a walk in the fucking park compared to that. 

Kratom sucks. It's almost been 2 months since I quit CT and I have gotten alot done. Finally have a new song coming out, my motivation is back, and I feel happy alot of the time. I'm really just happy to still be alive bc I thought I wasn't gonna leave that ambulance to be quite honest. 

The lingering chest pains are not so severe but kind of annoying. Sometimes they last a little while before subsiding. I havent had any the last couple days but then had some tonight after smoking a cigarette. Really would like any info on others experiencing this. I have another EKG Monday and blood work just to be sure I'm still OK.

What kratom took from me, I will get back. I can't get back those seven years though. I had alot of good experiences in those years. Played in some bands, found a wonderful woman who loves me,, etc. But also alot of sadness stemming from the inability to believe I could stop using it. The lying to my parents about being off drugs when in reality I was in deep with a plant I had no control over. The hard days where I beat myself up for not doing what I should be doing, which was being off drugs. I could be so much further ahead financially and health wise if I hadn't gotten hooked on kratom.

Good luck to all of you.

It was short but incredible sleep.   Right now, I’m awake, he’s asleep and don’t have the heart to wake him up.

At the worst I was consuming 5-6 super strong extract shots with phenibut per day. I tried CT back in October 2020 and it was absolutely fucking miserable. After 2 weeks of white knuckling through the withdrawals, using was literally all I could think about. So I relapsed, hard. But it got to a point where the nasty-tasting shit just had no fun in it whatsoever. It gave me anxiety. I was becoming agoraphobic at one point. My bank account was always pitifully low and my credit card debt was mounting. I had no motivation to do anything. I gained a bunch of weight. 

I decided I couldn't possibly justify the money I was spending on shots anymore, so I switched over to extract gummies and started being strict with my doses. I figured out that two of the gummies was the equivalent of about 1 shot. So to start with I took 3 gummies per day, one with each meal - the equivalent of about 1.5 shots. Not bad. I started cutting the gummies in half, and slowly tapering my daily doses that way. I would stick with the same dose for a long time before cutting it down - often 10 days or more. This process took months. I was terrified of going through WDs again; I knew I couldn't handle feeling that way without relapsing.  I eventually got to where I had cut the gummies into 1/8ths, and I was taking 3/8ths of a gummy per day. My goal was to quit before starting my new job, which began on January 31. I found myself forgetting to take doses. This was an excellent sign. 

I don't even remember exactly which day I took my last dose, but it was about a week before starting my job. I hardly noticed any withdrawal at all. I got covid that week, which sucked, but I didn't use and I didn't want to use. It's been 3.5 weeks now with zero kratom, and I don't want it at all. The only WD symptom I have is annoyingly unsatisfying and soft poops, and I understand it could take a while for those to be normal again. But overall I am so incredibly grateful to have this green monster off my back. I never thought tapering would work for me, but it has, and it was so much easier than CT. Maybe it was just my state of mind and readiness to quit the shit, but I wanted to share this story to give others hope that tapering successfully is possible.",23,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975442290306091}"

I have been trying to quit for about a year.  
Had 1/2 months periods, and some 5/6 day periods the last year.   
Now I'm quitting again. Day 1, feeling pretty good. Withdrawals won't be too bad, but the true challenge is PAWS for me. There will come a day soon, around 6/7 days where I will be super anxious and lack all motivation... 

I have sought professional help for addiction, and have been going there once a week from last december. I also have shared my desire to want to quit to people around me.  
Disapproval of use has never really been the best motivator for me, but encouragement when I succeed does.

There's a smartshop in my area, it's around the corner.   
For me, easily accessible Kratom is a huge trigger.  
Not being able to get it can make the difference.   
I went to the smartshop, and asked them to not sell me anymore...  
It's the second one in the area I asked, but this one's a bigger chain where (temporary) blacklisting is less common.   
The person behind the counter actually proposed to take a picture and send it to her colleagues.   
I thought it was very nice and I want to take every opportunity I can to get some hel, even if it's a bit awkward.  
There's a part of me that says I need to take sole responsibility, but there's also a part of me that says I need to take every bit of help I can get. I wish I could do this on my own, but I'm not ashamed.  


So, just wanted to say; you don't have to do this on your own... Taking responsibility for your addiction is important, but everyone needs and deserves help.   
I'm not sure how it works for others, but in my opinion initial freedom from addiction doesn't have to come from purely within. My brain will fuck me over, so for me practical, external measures make a huge difference.

The first night I don't sleep at all, then I exceed the first 24 hours of ""sobriety"", then additional cca 12 hours. It isn't too hard to me.

But then, when the next night is coming, it started get worse, because body and mind are pretty tired and I can't sleep again!

And if I still accidentally fall asleep, the sleep lasts maybe 3 hours and is not quality. Usually I wake up and feel like I haven't slept at all or even worse. The sleep is very light, full of bad dreams, nightmares and I feel like after 16 hours shift somewhere in the mines.

So the third day I feel horrible, exhausted, depressed and without energy and motivation. Generally like in a some king of true horror. Unable to work and func or do even the simplest activities. Surrouded by darkness.

I have some problems with sleep the whole life, but kratom CT it lifts into a whole new level.

Kratom made discipline irrelevant. If I didn't feel like doing something, BOOM take kratom, no discipline required.

I am 42 days kratom free after a rapid taper, 15GPD habit for 3 years.

I felt terrible PAWS for the first 32 days, then something shifted and my brain fog lifted just enough to feel mostly normal again. 

I still have lower than normal energy, and some days I feel PAWS still, but the past 10 days I've been able to get back to a fairly normal work schedule, gym, etc.

Throughout the first 32 days of PAWS, I was unable to accomplish much work due to anxiety and brain fog (some days literally nothing). I own my business so could get away with it.

But now that the fog has lifted I'm finding myself coming face to face with... regular old fatigue and struggling to push through.

I used to feel this same fatigue but kept working anyway. After 3 years of kratom, my discipline muscles are terribly out of practice.

Combined with 32 days of anxiety driven PAWS & retreating to YouTube at the first sign of resistance, I have some conditioning to overcome.

I am sooo grateful to be feeling good enough that I can even consider focusing on discipline, but I wanted to share this because it took me a good bit of journaling to understand that a good part of why I was struggling to work wasn't PAWS, but was actually that I just got soft!

I also hope we're okay to detail our history to tell the story of how we finally hit our breaking point, because a big part of recovery for me is sharing how I got here, as catharsis and a cautionary tale.

More accurately, you could say that I've been drug dependent for 22 years, since the age of fourteen, but that's not strictly on topic. ***Skip ahead to the kratom part if you don't want the full background profile of how/why I got addicted***. >!This is not to say that all drugs are inherently bad, more to detail their role in my life, but I started smoking weed at fourteen as an only child spending a lot of time alone in his room. I've always been into altered states of mind, fascinated by dreaming and 'lost in fantasy' since as far back as I can remember, and cannabis was like having company while alone - this is the key.!<

>!The first time I smoked, I did it alone, and fell immediately in love with that expanded, populated thought space, going from a weekend smoker to daily smoker by age 15. From there, I discovered how balancing alcohol with weed supercharged both at age 16 and compensated for my cannabis tolerance. This was still a novelty, and I didn't end up drinking daily with my daily smoking until age 19. I became a low/medium level alcoholic, needing both weed and booze nightly, eventually experimenting with codeine after heavy drinking on Sundays in 2010 and that's what led me to kratom.!<

>!Like weed before it, codeine felt like the drug I'd always wanted. I was extremely depressed at this time (age 25), taking antidepressants for the first time in my life, and it seemed like the perfect escape. I still drank, still smoked weed, now I was taking codeine almost every night. In 2012, a life changing LSD experience stripped me of my alcoholism over night (I was ready to quit and it just flipped that switch) and I reduced my cannabis use drastically, still in love with codeine.!<

So in 2014, I first tried this natural opiate alternative and ditched the codeine immediately for it. I actually reverted to being a weekend user for the first couple of years, hoping it might be sustainable. I soon found that I didn't even care about weed anymore, consolidating all my addictions into one that I felt I could live with. Obviously it doesn't work that way, because no chemical indulgence is sustainable without moderation I could never achieve.

Things hit critical mass with the night job I started in 2020, working 12 hour shifts in a security control room, four days on/off. I'd already started drinking it in the last few hours of my previous job to get a head start, now I was drinking throughout the long shifts, finding it conducive to staving off drowsiness and boredom, but paying my sleep debt in unhealthy marathons on my first day off. The days off were no better, living alone and drinking from the moment I got up until the point at which I finally ate. I'd feel enthused at first, only to slump into an unmotivated rut after the second dose. By this point, I was rarely actually feeling the high I initially adored, it just kept that fear of loneliness and boredom at the door (when it didn't fail at that too).

I began to loathe myself for being so dependent, especially as it barely had any effect anymore, and decided seriously to quit last year. I was getting off antidepressants (Effexor/venlafaxine) via slow taper, so I allowed myself to achieve that first, which I did in November. My last batch was in December and it lasted until three days ago, this is my first full day off work without kratom since I started.

I'm drinking a lot of loose leaf green tea, and so far I haven't felt the craving I'd feel so acutely when going a few days between batches. Tiredness is a real issue at work, and the shifts definitely feel longer, but once I have my tea rotation down, I should be able to make that work. Ultimately, it's not something I wanted to have to do, but the word I always come back to is 'unsustainable' - I've traded one vice for another since I was a teenage child. I miss that innocence of drawing excitement and enjoyment from what I did instead of what I consumed while I did it, I don't know if that will come back but I guess I'll finally find out.

At this point the worst of the PAWS are gone, but the past few weeks I've struggled alot with severe depression, lethargy, emptiness & total lack of motivation. I know my journey is not over & I won't say I'm over the worst of it. I know quitting kratom is a long road with many ups & downs. I know there are more bad days to be had. However I do feel so much better than I have in a long time.

I found myself completely isolating myself from my family, friends & the outside world. Didn't leave the house for I don't know how long. I work from home & just told everyone I was worried about covid & used that as my excuse anytime people asked me to go out & do anything. 

This weekend I took a turn for the better, went out to eat at restaurant & the next day spent time with family & friends watching the game & going for walks. I have decided I have to get out & get back to my life & stop blaming my quitting kratom for being a hermit. 

I also found myself drinking too much after quitting kratom, so I have decided to refrain from alchohol so that I can truly focus on my sobriety as a whole.

Here is what helped me: patience.  It will end.  You will not feel like this forever.  Also, I developed a chest cold during my final quit and taking some cough medicine helped me sleep.

Here is what didn't help me:  vitamin C, restful legs, bacopa, magnesium, etc.  Supplements didn't do anything as far as I could tell.

2022-02-14 14:53:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ssjme2/overestimated_my_intake/,Overestimated my intake,"TL,DR: get a scale.

I just started measuring my doses with a scale. I was way, way off on the amount I was taking. I was using a scoop from a kratom supplier, and for some reason I had it in my head that each scoop was 5 grams. I just weighed my dose this morning twice for accuracy, and two flat scoops of dry powder (my typical dose) comes out to just 5 grams! Here I thought my single dose was 10 grams!

Of course I take multiple doses per day. So I'm lowering it to 4 grams per dose. So far I'm not feeling any withdrawal symptoms from this.

I'm tapering down over the next few days to see how it goes. My problem is, being shut in with cold winter weather and on a work hiatus, I get bored and wander to the kitchen and take kratom. I'm starting a timer for four hours between doses now. I'll try 4.5 hours tomorrow.

Anyway, this is an attempt at a taper to quit. I have become a slave to this stuff, bringing it with me whenever I go anywhere (capsules) and doing dry powder when at home. I'm tired of waking up with a runny nose and weird anxiety. Plus, my libido is at its lowest ever. I'm 51 years old, but over the last two years of taking kratom, I have zero interest in sex or even masturbation. That's really frightening to me because it's a chemical adjustment of my body's natural physical state, not just mental state.

I also have almost zero appetite. I've been forcing food down the last couple months, though that also coincided with a mild case of Covid. (I'm vaxxed and boosted, BTW). I really believe Covid killed my appetite because my kratom intake hadn't changed and I was eating fine until I got sick

My blood work is tip-top. No problems there. No hair loss.

Anyway, wish me luck. And good luck to everyone out there.",3,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988510608673096}"

My doctor refused to give me anything, just told me to take Tylenol and Advil, they were helpful but not enough, and I work on my feet and was so desperate for pain relief I took everything I could that wasn't illicit. 

Kratom helped with pain and my mood. After my hip replacement surgery I kept taking it because I liked the energy it gave me, and figured it was harmless, that is until it was delayed in the mail for a couple days and I went into full withdrawal: sweating, shaking, puking, skin crawling etc. I had to call in sick for work until it arrived in the mail.

I was doing about 50g a day, I'd dose every 3 hours. I eventually cut down to 25-20g a day, every 4-6 hours. Last Friday I ran out and just went off it cold turkey. 

I'm on day 4 right now and still not able to go back to work, my skin hurts, my body is craving so bad, and I've never been this lethargic. I need to get back to work though. I've saved a small dose here at home just in case I needed to straighten myself out for a few hours. If I take that little bit to make the symptoms go away, will I just make the withdrawals last even longer?  Right now I feel like I'll never have any energy or be normal again.

So today is day 4 of my efforts to quit for good. I was taking 6 grams daily and on the weekends I’d say 10 grams daily. This went of for I’d say a year and 9 months. So 4 days ago I stopped taking my normal dosage and started only doing .5 of a gram a day. I have felt some withdrawals but not severe as other peoples and I’m assuming that’s because of my low usage compared to other people. 

Questions
Should I continue this .5 gram thing for a few more days, even weeks, or just cut it out for good?? 

Would I start to feel strong withdrawals once I cut it out completely? 

My withdrawals that I have been feeling are urges to use more than the .5, restless legs, minor back pain, sneezing and running nose, low energy. 

I find that working out really helps with the withdrawals so whenever I am not working I try to spend my time working out and after the workout I don’t feel much of the withdrawals the rest of the day.

I've been taking taking 6 to 8 gpd of kratom caps over the past 10 months or so. I started lower and worked my way up which I'm sure is a familiar story to nearly everyone on here. Last week on Tuesday, I decided I need to quit Kratom. I have thought about quitting a few times then fell into trap of finding the ""right time"" to quit. I've decided the right time is now.

My plan of attack has been the rapid taper method. I started by cutting down to 4.5 grams on Wednesday and with a capsule or so out a day I'm down to 3 gpd the last two days. The thing is though that I've had almost no symptoms. I certainly feel lethargic, depressed, and have been sneezing a bit more, but I've slept just fine and only had some mild quivers of the leg around bed time. I have been using Kava once or twice per day if I get a headache, and just got Vitamin C powder, Magnesium, and Black Seed Oil in the mail today. I've also cut my caffeine intake in half, which as of right now I couldn't recommend enough.

Here is--more or less--my question. I don't really have time off of work. I'm a full time grad student with an intensive work study program. I could spend a day in bed if need be but stuff will keep piling up. Based on how on feeling now I think I could cut down a half gram a day and be done by the weekend, but also I've been tapering so quickly I'm not sure if I'll be hit by a ton of bricks in the next day or so. If anyone has any similar experiences, please share. I'd like to know what I'm in for basically. 

This is obviously varied person to person and no answer will truly predict the future, but I'd like to get some opinions and just general support cause quitting is never easy. Also, I think there is a lack of info on medium length addictions at smaller gpd amounts that would help some people to quit while the quittins easy. What a great subreddit though. I genuinely appreciate everything y'all do.

I went from 15-20 gpd down to 1-2 over the summer and then back up to 6-10 for a while in the fall because some shit in my life got stirred up real bad. I'm back down to 1.6 gpd and have been holding strong on this current taper. 

I fucked my knee up last night at work because we got unexpectedly busy and were not staffed for it. Ran something like 14 miles, much of it up and down stairs and I'm really hurting. It's nothing new and I know from the past it will sort itself out in a week or so as long as I avoid abusing it as much as I can. This knee is a huge part of why I ended up hooked on kratom in the first place. Normally I'm fine to just tough this out but I've got a 16 hour day on Wednesday and were expected to be running quite a lot. I'd like to up my dose just to help me push through the day. 

I'm in no way worried this is going to be an event that throws me back into a spiral with this shit. I'm working too hard and have been fighting through these withdrawals on top of the worst chapter of my life to let that happen. But I'm pretty close to stabilizing at this new 1.6 gpd and I'm looking forward to taking a few days to feel somewhat normal once that happens. what I don't want is for taking a bigger dose Wednesday to significantly draw out getting stabilized at that dose. It doesn't seem all that likely that this will happen.

This post is rather long. It has two parts. First, there is my story. The second part is advice I would give to my past self. Feel free to skip one or the other :).

I am a recovering Kratom addict. Today it is 30 days since I've taken last dose. This sub was super helpful to me and I want to give back. So I thought I'll write something about my journey since similar posts helped me a lot.

# PART 1: My story

**Abuse start**

I am 24yo male living in Europe. I've discovered Kratom six years back. For the first 4 years. I was using it very sparingly. Max 3 times a week with breaks that lasted for months. I never imagined it can become an issue for me.

That changed when the quarantine happened. In my country, that was at the beginning of 2020. I started using Kratom daily (around 3-4g). At the start only one dose and then two. In a few months of such daily use, I realized what I was doing and tried to stop. On my second try, I was successful for a few weeks (after going through 5 days of mild wd). But as many of you might have done before me, I thought I will be able to go back to using 1-3 times a week. So I started using Kratom again. It took a few days and I was dosing daily again. I stopped for a few days here and there but in the end, I was using as I was before, even more. At the start of 2021, I was using 3-5g twice a day. I tried to stop, but the longest I was able to do was 20 days in summer. I started using with ""Just this once"" excuse. But I have used Kratom every day since then and slowly increased the dose. Before I stopped 30 days ago, I was doing 4-5g 2-3 times a day. I had everything pre weighted and portioned into little one-time zip bags - so I can take my doses with me to work, or elsewhere...

Since I started taking Kratom daily (since 2020) I knew it was bad. It did not destroy my life. But it diminished my potential. I was numb to some extent. I believe that to be happy and fulfilled in life, one needs to be connected with the world. One needs to feel and listen to himself and others. Kratom makes that harder. When I was high on Kratom I was able to function, I was able to get by, smile, maybe even enjoy some moments. But I was also numb, it was much easier to ignore some issues in my life that I want to address. It was easier to become content with living in a lie and not trying to achieve things I care for. I told myself ""Everything is good, I can live like this"". But deep down I knew I could not, deep down I knew I was hurting myself with Kratom. 

There is a difference between acceptance and ignorance. I am not saying one should always be solving every problem and for some of us, it is hard to be perfect. And especially for me. Sometimes I am hard on myself, afraid that I am not good enough at work, that I am getting fat (although I have 10% of body fat). I have a problem just relaxing and permitting myself to play some PC game from time to time, or watching a movie... But in the end, I end up procrastinating and being harsh on myself because of it. Kratom gave me a way out. It made me ignorant in a way. But it helped. I could play games, watch movies and not give a fuck about me being productive. Don't get me wrong. I was still able to be productive and I have made the biggest carrier advance in the last few months. But I was ignorant. It is not good to be that. One should accept how he/she feels and that maybe it is impossible to sustain 100% productivity all the time...

I was not living the life I wanted. I was still going around being numbed by Kratom. And I was scared, where I'll be in 5 years, how many bad decisions would I make while deciding in this numb state induced by Kratom. I would like to create my musical album. I was not able to do that, kratom makes music flat, and makes composing a good song almost impossible.

**The quit**

This brings me to this January. My girlfriend almost broke up with me. She told me that I am not listening enough (she was right) and that she loves me, but can not be with someone who does not seem to care about her. It was a communication issue but I believe that my numbness was the real cause. Although I was still taking Kratom at that time, it hurt, I love that girl. And in that time I have decided to quit. 

It was awful. I had diarrhoea, could not sleep more than 4h (I know, I am lucky for at least that, some people can not sleep at all), had to force the food down my throat, but the worse was the anxiety. I was anxious all the time. We were able to save the relationship with my girlfriend. But the anxiety did not go away. The First 1-2 weeks were the worst. I had trouble concentrating at meetings, could not focus while coding and was crying all the time...

What helped was friends. I tried to be around someone as much as I could. That helped, I was still able to laugh with friends chat, help people out with their stuff... 

I have started seeing a therapist that specializes in addiction. That was very useful and I recommend it if you can save some money it is a deal-breaker. 

**After accutes**

I was able to get through the first two weeks and the worst is behind me. I still feel anxious and empty sometimes, but I try to accept it. It is manageable and I can see it fading and getting better and better. I have also decided to give myself permission to procrastinate. I am learning to accept that sometimes it is not bad to play games or watch a movie and that it is not possible to be 100% productive all the time. 

I have decided to take everything one by one. I am also addicted to chewing nicotine and in a past, I tried to quit nicotine and Kratom at the same time. This time I will do it after I get over the most Kratom withdrawals. I want to do small steps to hike up the mountain, not try to sprint to the top and injure myself in the middle (hope you understand my analogy here :D)

# PART 2: Advice 

I would like to write down some advice for my past self. Everyone is different, but maybe it will be useful to you too.

**Accept how you feel**

You should learn to accept how you feel. It might sound like the perfect excuse to keep taking kratom. But it is not. If you had accepted how you feel, you would have seen that kratom is really hurting you and you would be able to accept the fact that you need to quit. 

Also, when WDing, accept the suck. That does not mean don't try to make it better. Acceptance is not ignorance. Do what you can. Try supplements, exercise, go out with people... But after you do what you can, accept the suck. It is hard, but most of the discomfort comes from fighting the bad feelings. Accepting them won't make them disappear, but it will make them manageable and that is so relieving!

**Find support in other people**

Tell your friends. You don't have to tell every person that is in your life. But tell someone. A good friend or partner. You will be surprised by how supportive people are. This was a game-changer for me. Every person I told beleived that I can quit. They told me that I will do it and they were really supportive.

Also, if you have money buy a session with a therapist. Ideally every week, but at least once. Later you can space out the sessions, but in the beginning, it is super helpful to talk to someone who is trained in helping people with addiction.

**Don't change everything at once**

Sometimes, we want to do a big change in our lives when quitting Kratom. If you want to start going to the gym or pursue a new carrier, or maybe quit smoking too, by all means, try, but don't beat yourself up if you don't succeed. The only thing that really matters is quitting Kratom. You can keep trying the other things, but for the next 3-6 months success is not taking Kratom. That's all. You didn't go to a gym today? Have you taken kratom? No? Ok, today is a success no matter if you haven't gone to a gym or bought another pack of cigarettes. **You can try tomorrow everything else except not taking Kratom.**

**Do daily checkups and/or write a diary**

Every day on this sub, there is a daily checkup thread created. Write how many days are you free and share how are you feeling, don't be afraid to go into details. Also, comment on someone's status. It really goes a long way. 

If you can, write a diary, every evening note down how the day went. Don't spend more than 2mins on this (or do, if you feel like it). It will help you to keep track. If you ever feel bad, read the first seven days. I can guarantee you you will see improvement when you'll be feeling down on day 14 and you read how you felt on day 3!

**Be careful with supplements**

I would be careful with supplements. Research what is ok to take long term. And make sure to cycle out what isn't. Here is an overview of something that helped me (**I am not in any way expert on this, do your own research, I really don't know what am I talking about here**): 

* L-tryptophan - helps with sleep and mood. Is effective after a week of use, for the first week I have taken 3x 150mg, next week I took 2x 150mg and last few days I have taken 1x 150mg. It might not be a good idea to take it long term.
* Valerian root - Helps sleep, I took 1g before bed. This might also not be safe to take long term since it might downregulate GABA receptors or something... 
* Magnesium - Before bed, we all know what magnesium does. Find the most bioavailable form. If you are taking a safe dosage, this is ok to take long term.
* Vitamin C - some people swear by it. Try it and you'll see. Make sure to find the most bioavailable form.
* Probiotics - find a good brand and take them as recommended. Helps with digestive issues.
* Microdosing psilocybin - ok, this is really controversial, and you need to do your own research on this. Look into r/microdosing for guidance if you are interested in this. I have tried the protocol when you take a dose every 4th day. Not sure if it helped though... 

**Exercise if you can**

Cardio, weight lifting, sauna, Wim Hof breathing, Yoga. If you feel bad, try to force yourself to go to a sauna or for a jog. I will give you some relief for the time you exercise and maybe even a little after.

**Commit to never taking Kratom again**

Don't think that you can start taking Kratom responsibly. Everyone says this thinking has brought them back to abusing Kratom. Don't do the same mistake. But if you start again, don't beat yourself up. Just accept it and quit over again. 

I wish I could express how important this is! But I also know that I would not understand if I haven't done it numerous times in the past. It does not work like that. Once you start abusing a drug, you can't go back to using it without abusing it. Trust me!

This was my experience of quitting Kratom so far. I hope it was helpful. If your red so far, thank you! Also, thank you to everyone on this sub. It is so helpful when someone replies with a positive comment or reading a story of someone who quit a year ago and is happy now. 

Stay strong guys! It is possible to quit and eventually, we will heal and learn to be happy again!

See you again in daily checks and around this sub! Love you guys ♥️",33,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997403085231781}"

I have no urge to use kratom. Never have never well. Even when I was taking it, I didn’t enjoy how it made me feel and only took it as a last resort to manage my severe chronic pain. I’m not worried about relapsing as long as I have sufficient pain control from my pain doctor once I’m off kratom I won’t need it. 

I know the obvious stay active but I can’t really do that as a disabled person. I try to keep my mind occupied as much as possible obviously. 

I’m following a very precise tapering schedule. I take kratom twice a day and every 5-7 days I reduce each of my two daily doses by .25gpd for a total drop of .5gpd. Based on my recent worsening and severe withdrawals I wanna do a drop of just one of my daily doses by .25 grams so just a total drop of .25gpd about every 5-7 days literally halving my taper speed. 

I’m curious what y’all did and how it went? I imagine I’m going much slower than most people it’s been like 2 months now. Started at 6.75 grams and about 2 days ago dropped to 3.5 grams (both twice a day).",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975917339324951}"

Felt like I was dying for a week a month ago, then I realized I was fine (just a panic attack, no real physical/heart condition). A week later I went ""is my hair thinning?"". Now I have a great widows peak. I can still make it look good, but I think all of this is Kratom related.

So for 25-35 year-old men: if your hairloss was from Kratom (as far as you can see), did it return after quitting? I see a lot of women reversing their hair-loss in this sub, but not a lot of men. (btw to women thinking of quitting, it's pretty much universal that you'll get your hair back if you think you lost any to kratom. For men, I think it makes you start balding 10-20 years sooner than you would have and there's not much you can do about that)

Either way, I can style it now to make it look good. So I should just stop so it doesn't get any worse. For men, how was your hair after 3-6 months of abstinence?

EDIT: I'm a 29-year-old Male, so some baldness is expected at some point, but I did not expect it this early from the pattern of my other relatives (I think only my uncle had got some kind of balding, my dad is completely fine despite being >50) (I only notced it was happening a few weeks ago after 6 months of heavy [17gpd] kratom use)

What gives me ease now is to remind myself that I can't know if it's permanent or kratom-related until I abstain from kratom for at least 3 months.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9113479852676392}"

I made it 12 days and couldn't take it no more cause I was having bad stomach problems and bad pain in my legs and back. I have numerous health issues in both and have had back surgery that causes the pain. I was on subs for years and it masked how much worse the pain had actually gotten till I jumped from 16mgs of subs. That's when I found kratom and right from the start my tolerance was so high from the subs I had to take a lot of kratom to stop wd and ease my pain. I don't want to take kratom no more. I don't like what it's doing to my body and life and I'm disabled so I really can't afford it. My Dr won't give me anything but gabapentin and lyrica. So a few weeks ago I decided to stop taking it. Like I said I made it 12 days and had to start taking it again. I take the capsules. I don't know if we're allowed to say what strain we are taking but the one I take starts with train. I only have to take it twice a day. When I started taking it again I was back up to 40-45 capsules twice a day. I have got myself tapered down to 26 twice a day but last night and tonight I have to take 30 and 33 to get my back and legs eased off. Other than that the only problem I've had is insomnia. But for some reason I can't get lower than 26 capsules and when I do the pain gets so bad I have to take it back up some. I don't have much kratom left and no money to get any more. But I don't want to go through the 12 days of hell that I just went through so I need to get to a lower dose before I run out so hopefully the wd won't be as bad as last time. I also have depression and anxiety that I have to deal with during wd cause it makes it worse. I was going to try to taper by 2 capsules every day. I don't think I have enough to drop every 2 days. Would this help minimize the wd once I'm out or am I just going to be in constant wd the whole time. Someone said it might be best if I just try to ct from here and when it gets so bad take just a few to ease the wd. But wouldn't that just extend the wd? I've got to find a way to keep the pain in my back and legs at a manageable level while I'm doing this. I tried gabapentin the last time for a few days and the only thing it helped me with was sleep the first couple nights. After that it didn't even help with that. I tried the lyrica when I jumped off subs and it didn't help me then so I don't think it would help now. I'm going to try to get the vitamin c and try it but don't know if I can get it for when I need it. So I really don't know what I'm going to do about that but which way would be better to try? To taper 2 capsules a day or do it like someone told me to, to ct now and just take a little bit of kratom when I just can't handle it no more? I'm sorry this is so long and I hope it makes sense.

Just like you all I am here to do the same thing you are all doing. And that's kick this gas station garbage and get back to my true self. Back story: I was a heavy user for about 1 1/2 years. At first it was the honeymoon phase with it. I thought ""Wow, this is helping my anxiety and I feel so great while taking it!"" fast forward not too much longer after to spiraling and eating this stuff from the moment I woke up, until I went to sleep. I hated myself. I hated that I was making my wife upset because I wasn't me. I was easily irritated, I'd stay up all night playing video games on K benders and hindering myself of sleep. I'd fall asleep randomly throughout the day from being so exhausted. However, this story isn't completely negative! (I guess) haha. July 2020 I kicked the habit and I couldn't have done it without the aid of my wife and the grace of having a MMJ card and truly using it as medicine.

I didn't dream of ever touching this stuff again. If I went into a store and I made eye contact with a bottle or bag of it, I'd move my eyes immediately somewhere else. Unfortunately, around September 2021 I started to hang out with an old friend again (the one who told me about this). He was still an avid user but after I explained to him before hanging out again that this stuff ruined me and I don't ever plan to make the choice to take it again. So he didn't bring it over, but once he started to get comfortable, he'd push for me to just take it ONE time. And I take full responsibility of my actions and eventually broke and figured ""why the hell not, it's just one time"". That flooding euphoria come back, took away all the bad feelings and made me feel the way it makes us all feel at first.

That ""one time"" I'm talking about has been my everyday since then. And I don't want to associate, see or hear about this stuff ever again. I have tried to stop since then, and I haven't taken nearly as much daily as I used to, but I had such a hard time with cold turkey, I'm asking if someone could recommend a plan for a rapid taper (huge thanks to u/Lightsong_theBold for giving me some info on how he did it).

I'm not sure how much are in capsules. I was taking 30-40 capsules every night. Currently stuck on 30 a night.

If anyone could point me in the right direction, I would be forever grateful. I'm lucky to have my wonderful wife who will be helping me end this horror by holding onto the capsules and dishing them out to me once we have a set in stone plan. I know I'm going to feel like shit no matter what at some point, but cold turkey had me barely sleeping through the night, terrible restless leg syndrome, my mood was out of whack (anger, emotional, etc.) But I am hoping that a rapid taper will set me right.

Edit to my post: I have quit kratom, im sorry if I worded it wrong, I was very upset when I wrote it and I can see how I was unclear about me quitting 

Has anyone noticed when stopping  Kratom that they were polissibly taking it to mask a situation? What I mean by that is when you quit you realized you were masking being in an unhealthy relationship and took it because it gave you that little euphoria that made you look pass the shity relationship you were in or made it so the relationship was easier to deal with. I'm not sure if I'm wording it right but I hope it makes sense. 
I see so many people write about how they quit and their relationship is so much better with their partner. 
Granit I feel like the rest of my relationships are better now that I quit however I feel like im realizing my relationship with my spouse SUCKS. I feel like im doing so much work on myself, self care, self improvement, working out and just bettering myself. He has told me so many times he wants to be supportive and help anyway possible. The one thing i have asked him to do is not drink. He is a mean, horrible, completely different person when he drinks. He told me tonight I need mental help bc I was upset that he was drunk by 230. He told me to go get help and once I did the rest of it would all fall in place. When I was having some hard PAW days I cried a lot and let me guard down and now all he does is use it against me. 
I tell him all the time :you can go 30 days without drinking for work but can't do it for your family""
A couple weeks ago in counseling we had to trade off request to one another and try to meet eachothera for a month. Mine was for him to not drink. Well apparently he thought that meant just dont drink in front of me so he either drives around and drinks or he hides it around the house. He is the primary bread winner and I'm a stay home mom, if I worked and brought home a steady pay check I'd be out if here. We live very comfortably financially however I feel like everything else sucks. I get such bad anxiety when he leaves the house bc I know he will be stopping by the store and getting beer and who knows what kind of mood he will come home in. If I get sick, great example when I was having horrible withdrawals from kratom my anxiety was 100 times worse bc he can't handle the kids so he just goes and get beer and then fights with them. Our older one (7 years old) especially.  He adores and is so goo goo over our 1.5 yr old. We are doing therapy with our older one bc their relationship is Rocky to say the least. Ee make 3 steps forward with her and he gets drunk and we go 100 steps back.
Sorry for the rant and if you made it this far thank you.

I’ve been addicted to Kratom for the past 1 year or so and am currently addicted to 5+ OPMS Black Capsules per day and 10-50g per day. I’ve decided I want to go into rehab and detox this month at my parents request. I more or less have two options. I can 1) tell them I’ve been drinking for 1-2 months and taking Kratom heavily for 1 year, and that I need to be detox from both Kratom and Alcohol. If I choose this route, they will give me a benzo taper at detox and I will tell them that I do not want to touch the sub taper at all. 
Alternatively, I can tell them that I just need to be detoxed from Kratom and I’ll tell them that I’m open to a suboxone taper. I have basically NEVER done real opiates. In one (and only one) scenario I did take 50mg of oxy to see what it would feel like. This was 6h~ after taking Kratom and running out. However, I guess Kratom has some type of antagonist effect because I felt little to nothing off of the 50mg, it felt just like a weak dose of Kratom. In other words, I have never experienced real opiates, so I don’t think a sub taper would be best? I know subs can be strong and induce euphoria.

Reading thru the post on this sub had helped me to finally take the plunge and say enough and once and for all stop. 
So my kratom intake was getting pretty out of hand. Started off doing around 15 gpd and adding to whenever tolerance developed. For the last few months I was taking at minimum 90 gpd and sometimes more. I stopped cold turkey...not sure if it's considered CT or not because I had gabapentin to help me out. I used high dose gabapentin for 6 days to help with withdrawal and nothing or the 7th and 8th day and no withdrawal yet. Maybe the wd stage is over? The craving for kratom is still very very strong but I figure if I was able to quit that much and lucky enough to not be having wd at this stage it would be incredibly stupid to start the whole process over again. So how long do the cravings last and when do they start to fade some? Is it possible that I could get some type of wd later on at some point or if I haven't had and for the last 2 days after having ran out of gabapentin, are they probably not going to happen?

I sometimes went up to 5 gpd but the last 2-3 years it's been a steady 3 gpd. I used kratom for energy and focus (but I since realized it was likely just numbing me to feel comfortable and not providing much focus). 

Went to stem and vein for 3rd dose bit a while, tapered to 2 doses, then said screw this just 1 gpd and now decided to rid myself of the green devil fully for 3 days now. Felt a bit tired but still drink coffee (2-3 cups per day which always have). Took sulbutamine and NAC last few days and feel mostly fine, energy coming back actually better than what I was on kratom! 

Slight headache and some minor fatigue but then again, I can't imagine my WD will be that bad seeing as I'm cold turkeying from 1-2 gpd now...

It seems like many people here love that feeling of just being ""okay"" or have convinced themselves that they do. I'm speaking with my therapist and trying to stay strong through all this. Logically I know how terrible this shit was for my life. It ruined me. It brought out a horrible, mean, apathetic asshole who only cared about pleasure. Technically my life is infinitely better than where I was two weeks ago, but emotionally, physically.... it's so fucking boring. I have been working out, making art, hiking, etc. Its just not scratching that itch. I worry I'll never feel actual pleasure again. Or nothing close to that. I'm so frustrated that I have to choose between having a life and feeling good. I have a deeper, more sustainable and subtle appreciation for life and those around me, but it's a different animal. It's not a replacement. I know this is for the best. I know relapse is not an option for me. I've just been having a lot of doubts. Is a life without euphoria even worth it?

With the help of this subreddit, I have successfully tapered down from about 40 grams a day to 22+. 

During this entire period, I have used Red Borneo from just one company. We’ll call this company Company X. The consistency of strain gave me a stable base for tapering. 

Several months ago, Company X ran out of the strain I was using. I had enough stashed to last another month and also tried the Red Borneos and similar strains from three different companies. None of these strains worked that well. I had much worse withdrawal symptoms on all of these strains, even at exactly the same dose. I came to the conclusion that because I had used the same strain for literally several years that I was deeply addicted to that one particular strain (Is this even possible?)

Finally, several weeks ago, Company X got Red Borneo back in stock. I immediately ordered more and thought my problems were over and that I would be able to get stabilized and start my taper again.

But that didn’t happen. I am on my third day of using the new Red Borneo at exactly the same dose as before. But I am having fairly bad withdrawals on a dose that previously enabled me to function. I am having cold flashes, sleep problems, RLS about half the time, a ton of muscular tension, body aches, dizziness, and large amounts of anxiety. About half of each day I am very uncomfortable with massive anxiety and having difficulty working and interacting with people. Note: I am not having full-blown withdrawals. I can sleep 5-6 hours a night and am functional, if not comfortable, about half of the time. 

I really don’t understand what is going on, since I am taking the same strain at the same dose from the same company. Do any of you have an explanation for what is happening? What can I do to get stable again? I have thought of increasing my dose to see if that helps, but I hate going backwards when I have worked so hard to get where I am.

Being that I am a somewhat recovered alcoholic, I began to apply my alcohol abuse patterns to the kratom. Drink for two/three days straight, then on day 3/4 drink significantly less to ease the withdraws, then on day 5/6 go cold turkey, day seven (be somewhat functioning sober) then start the week over. For kratom I built up a tolerance extremely quickly and thought “ok I’ll just go cold turkey” first of all this did NOT work for even a couple of hours, I was breaking into my purse for some by noon. A Couple of days I had to go home from work to just lay in bed, it was deep pain in my back that was almost debilitating. I am very familiar with alcohol withdraws but this was not only a terrible mental feeling but physical pain that I have never felt before(not aches but piercing sharp pains in all major joints that I would assume how extreme arthritis or broken bones feel(I could not move my arm)). I developed pain in my shoulders and wrists after hardly using them at work or even on my off days. 

My body seriously feels like it has aged 50 years. I eventually tapered down by only taking enough to rid the extreme pains and have now been completely off of it for two weeks. I also have the help of gabapentin for the pain, but I don’t take it everyday to preserve it. But even with the gabapentin I have never felt physical pain like this before, I’m convinced that kratom stopped my body from creating whatever it is that stops us from feeling pain in normal movements. 

So 2 and a half weeks clean, I’m sitting in bed with a wrist and kneee brace and a heating pad on my back. I’m only TWENTY TWO YEARS OLD. And simply using my back or wrists or shoulders mildly ends with me needing pain medication or complete rest.

I started very slowly at a very low gpd and didn’t really think I would get bad side effects considering the amount and length of time I’ve used k, which has just now been a year.

The reason I’m quitting is because of my hair. I noticed it started to look thinner about 3-4 months ago. Since then it’s gotten worse. I’m a relatively healthy 30 year old woman. I’ve lost at least half of my hair’s volume. I don’t have any bald spots but my hair is so thin and brittle. 

My confidence has absolutely plummeted because I can’t do anything with my hair. Can’t curl it, can’t straighten it, can’t put it up. I usually just braid it into a very sad braid and leave it at that. 

I can’t believe I didn’t immediately quit when I noticed my hair starting to thin at first and I’m worried it’s all going to end up falling out.

I’m so sad, guilty, and ashamed I did this to myself, over something that was marketed to me as a safe pain relief and energy booster at my local CBD shop. 

I started taking vitamins regularly a month ago and added collagen powder around the same time, I started using black seed oil and castor oil on my scalp today and have been generally being very gentle with my hair.  If anyone has any other suggestions I’m ready to hear them. I bought some minoxidil but I’m afraid to use it.

4 days, (96 hours) without any dose.

I used Kratom to pair with SSRI’s, to combat depression and anxiety. That pairing felt great in the moment and seem to be a godsend, but never made me feel very comfortable that I was combining these. Then, I went on to get weird hand tremors and developed a high NIBP, which i’ve never had. Unsure if that’s the K or the weird combination I was cocktailing for 36 months.

Regardless it was time to shelve this stuff. 

Anyways, right now I’m lacking motivation and energy. Pretty fucky headaches, and my stomach is JACKED up. I mean laxatives are barely getting it done. The good part - the hand tremors have disappeared within just a few days, which is wild. Also, no psych symptoms yet.


Is 4 days just the tip? Based on my usage, what should I expect? Speculation welcome.

The type of anxiety that can be triggered by any thought or anything really, thats why i started kratom and used pills and dope in the past. It makes be feel like how i am by myself inside my head while being around others and out in public, ofc that honeymoon quickly fades after that first month then you are just chasing and holding on to the release. But i digress, sorry guys, my habit was 15- 25 gpd for the past 3 months been using daily for 8 months besides a week in jail.  im male 23yo and i was having all sorts of problems as of the past month, hair thinning and loss, aggravation of hip and back prbs, depression,  isolation all that standard mental. Well i quickly tapered to one dose daily ( as long as i could last that day ) went from 4gpd to 3.5 to 2.5. And today is day one, 24hrs at 9am this morning, was absolutely reckted bro felt like i was coming off of phenibut fr, never woulda expected i suppressed all that anxiety from kratom and this is what it would be like to pay the piper. I ended up taking phenibut 1.2g at work today it was so bad and nothing bro , i was like holy fuck fr. Well fast forward to 45 minutes ago i took some ksm66 extract gummies from a health foods store and BAM ! All that heart racing isolation needed feeling gone, i swear dude, idk it could be the phenibut in combination but i am 3 hrs past the should be peak levels for that. Never had something work this good for withdrawls. ALSO, kava kava works very well, i used it during my taper at night and it did wonders for anxiety, it is a pretty lethargic/super relaxant buzz so i wouldnt recommend it at work myself but ymmv. I used NOW brand kava kava capsules tosh n washed ( seems less harsh on the stomach this way ) and Goli brand ashwagandha gummies. NOW brand kava kava may be hard to find at stores rn cause there is a suppy chain shortage for them but Amazon still had some last i checked, i trust NOW cause they do third party testing for heavy metals pesticides and the capsules are standardized for a minimum 30% kavalactone content. Again this is really only good for the anxiety and social irritability of WD in my experience. I try and use only the recommended servings of these products but have taken double and triple servings of kava (4-6 cap) within a few hours and have no ill effects to report.

I started using kratom at the end of 2020. I would take it twice a week to play video games and relax. (I have OCD and I cannot seem to relax and have fun without a substance. I constantly feel unproductive and shitty unless I'm high.) This worked for about 7 months, it worked great actually. I could balance my 2 fun nights a week with work, art and my other hobbies. As time elapsed I began to use higher doses, eventually adding a third day of use into my weeks too. I got to the point where I couldn't wait for those 3 days of my week. I'd fantasize about it at work. I eventually started using 4 days a week... you can see where this is going. I started to slip into a depressive episode due to some unfortunate circumstances in my relationship and personal life. I started to not limit my use to nights. I'd take it with my coffee in the morning. Eventually I was nullifying myself 24/7, going through about 15 g/pd, taking grapefruit juice, cayenne pepper and insane amounts of turmeric to feel any amount of euphoria at all. I'd feel at peace for about an hour or so during that first daily dose, but it would turn into this boiling rage. I became hyper-irritable after a while, I'd look for arguments on reddit, I'd get super annoyed with my girlfriend and family for little insignificant things. It was like I actually ENJOYED being pissed off. In my mind being angry and numb was still better than being suicidally depressed and sober. I am not an angry or violent person at all, but the kratom aroused some dark side of my being that I wasn't even fully aware of.

All of this came to a head about a week ago. My girlfriend confronted me about my use and the state of our relationship (rightfully) and I basically snapped and punched a wall out of frustration (with myself for not feeling like I was able to quit. not angry at her). I proceeded to barricade myself in the bathroom and start slashing at my wrists and arms with a box cutter. I wanted to die. I felt so ashamed of what I had become. I did not love myself before the kratom, but the kratom use really made me become someone I hated. I was physically weak, creatively bankrupt, emotionally vacant and I couldn't raise anymore denials. 

I ended up being admitted to a mental hospital. I was surprised at the lack of cravings I had. I didn't really feel sick. I just didn't feel good. I was there for a week and it's been 5 days since I was discharged. I haven't used at all and I don't plan on it, but I've noticed something. I cannot enjoy video games with my friends anymore. I don't enjoy relaxing. It's like everything is so dull and boring now. I feel so much better mentally and my relationships have been infinitely better, but I still have this aching in me. I really miss having fun playing games and feeling at peace with everything. I miss the euphoria. I have experienced anhedonia before when I was younger when I stopped my constant marijuana use, but this feels different. I know logically that I am incapable of using responsibility and I will end up hurting myself and those around me, but I also feel so unbearably average. It sounds so fucked up. Feeling average kinda sucks compared to that euphoria, but hating yourself for the other 23 hours of the day after that initial hit sucks compared to feeling average. 

Will this feeling go away? 

Will I ever actually enjoy video games or relaxation as much as I did on kratom? 


(I know life isn't all about fun.
I am very productive and responsible. 
I just can never seem to shut it off. 
I just can't seem to enjoy entertainment or relaxation without feeling bored or guilty.

I know Kratom can be a godsend for people that have an opiate dependency. Surely there’s a real function to this stuff but 
I’m in a crash course of the negatives atm.

I have anxiety and depression. Not serious, diagnoses, but the symptoms are there. I take a small Zoloft dose and a small Abilify dose to pair with that. Works wonders - however it never got me over lack of drive or apathy that stemmed from the nonsituational depression. That’s where I found Kratom. Seemed like a miracle at first. Within a hour of a modest dose, i felt interest, passion, drive, overall feeling of ambition. Which was VERY attractive.

Fast forwars 3 years now, and I take 12-15 grams per day. Typically three doses, breakfast/lunch/dinner. The effects are still there, but have surely migrated from the warm euphoria that we all experienced at first.


30 + hours ago I took my last dose. I’ve wanted to quit for a number of reasons. I feel my hand temors may be related to kratom. I feel like kratom slowed me down (paired with ssri) to orgasm during intercouse. Suddenly I have a high NIBP which is a bit random for me. I’m highly active. The main kicker was I got a bag of kratom from a headshop vendor that just didn’t smell right. The effects were essentially non existent. For whatever reason I instantly become constipated. I’ve NEVER had issues with digestion. Could this be a symtom of withdrawal if the kratom I bought was insanely weak? No clue what the stomach issue is about. 

Anyways, because of the stomach concerns, i quit 30 hours ago. It’s just that time tbh. I gotta figure out something more sustainable - mentally. I’ve also have never been completely comfortable with the SSRI and atypical paired with essentially an opiate.
30 hours in and I literally have chills and zero desire to work or workout. It’s scary this stuff could be so strong. I’ve never dealt with dependency, any insights?

I woke up feeling like a have a mild cold, I was even worried if it could be Covid (I'm under 30, so I don't reeeeally fear it, but I still don't like the thought of it), took me half a day to remember that it could be Kratom withdrawals, googled around ... and yep, bingo!

I was taking around 20 capsules 3-4 days a week for around 4 to 6 weeks, actually just because of boredom and because I thought that it would have no downside... I took 5 capsules on Sunday afternoon, surely around 30+ hours ago, because my back was hurting a bit and I loved Kratom as painkiller ... little did I know that this was my first sign of withdrawal.

Now it's 7 AM here and I didn't sleep one second, my legs are all over the place, I read that quitting ct causes this and that you can limit those effects when taking a little, but nope! I'm really shocked how this messed me up, I never thought about physical withdrawal symptoms.

I'm very glad that I can work from home, at my own schedule, live alone, and can basically suffer without having to function or bothering someone, but anyways the thought of not sleeping for the next couple of days is really frightening to me, this is just super annoying. But not annoying enough to take 2 capsules to get rid of those symptoms.

I started using Kratom to alleviate some mental health problems.  
I've dealt with depression and psychosis through the years, and often experience a constant anxious discomfort in my body through the day. Kratom helped me alleviate the discomfort, depression and just be active. 

I've quit and the intense discomfort is just back. I hate(d) being addicted to this stuff. I plowed through cravings yesterday.. But it's morning now and already craving for just some comfort and rest.  
I hate to be this cynical and know that I appreciate ANYONE being able to quit this substance.  
But sometimes reading messages from people quitting Kratom, and they start feeling actually better and more like themselves because they, for instance, don't have the underlying health conditions I have makes me a bit jealous. Again, I'm sorry to compare. Everyone has their own set of difficulties in life. It's never easy quitting this stuff. 

I know Kratom will be eventually detrimental, but the amount of support I got from it sometimes feels like it outweighs these pains I am going through now. 

I already am on a mood stabilizer and an anti-psychotic, and they do an alright job. But I still feel this way. Now is probably the time to start getting to the core of this issue, but I haven't been able to work out what it is and how to beat it for many years.

Well my job starts in a week and I’m off everything now except kratom (and caffeine, but I’ll give that one a pass for now) but kratom has definitely been my biggest demon of the last five years.

I was talking to an old friend today who used to have the same problem with kratom and with quitting and he recommended I do something he called the flood dose today, so I did exactly that.

I’m sure this isn’t the advised method of anyone but I’ve quit multiple times in my life, even up to 3-months, but have always come back, so I wanted to make my last dose a particularly painful one. 

Last night I never went to bed, I stayed up and fasted for 15 hours, and within 90 minutes I finished two bags of kratom, bought a new ounce bag, and finished most of that.

For many that does probably isn’t that much, but over the last five years even though I took kratom multiple times a day, I was usually only taking a few grams every few hours.

Welll after this dose everything was incredibly uncomfortable. I don’t throw up very easily but I ended up scream vomiting for a long time and then became unable to move. The next ten hours have been filled with a lot of pain and discomfort. I feel very sick, don’t have the physical or mental energy to do even the smallest things and generally just feel like death.

I hope this works and I have the willpower to stay off this substance moving forward. I know this isn’t a conventional CT method but desperate times call for desperate measures I guess.

Big thanks to you all, you have all been very inspiring to me and reading similiar storys gave me hope in my darkest hours more than once. I guess with sharing my story I want to give you something back. This will be quite a huge text, so bring some time (at least 30 Minutes I guess?) if you're interested in reading the whole thing. I might be better of writing a book about all this than writing a massive reddit post. To be honest: It's actually kind of a project I started many years ago. But maybe I first have to push through all this pain, to finally be able to actually finish this book. I really hope it will have a happy ending. Maybe you all can help me somehow to write this final chapter. And be a part of it. 

First I would like to tell you a little bit (or more precise, actually a lot^^) about my history of Kratom use which in the end hopefully leads to a deep understanding of my current life situation. 

I basically used Kratom 10 years on and off. As you all know addiction can be a pretty sneaky bitch. So I was able to use it without any problematic addiction tendencies till my mid 20s (I'm 31 now). After my father lost his long battle against cancer in 2014, my overall drug use began to get more... I don't know how to say. Reckless? I basically started to give less and less fucks about rules, I followed for my whole life. I started using Kratom for longer periods of time (~few weeks), but I always knew that I was playing a dangerous game there. So I always quitted and stayed mostly sober for a few weeks after a prolonged episode of daily use. Withdrawals were minimal and easy to battle. When withdrawals finally got worse years later, I was already in deep trouble.

What made Kratom most compelling to me was it's forgiving nature: Most of the time I took roughly the same dosages and daily amounts (20 gpd in two doses, maybe once a week I took a third dose midday to make it a total of max. 30 gpd), and even after two years of daily use it still worked. Of course effects were not as strong anymore as when I started to use and a big part of the effect was just getting rid of withdrawals and to feel normal again. To function. 

With other opiats i could feel dimished effects after just a few days of use - why I never took them on a daily basis for a longer time. Also the toll on the body and the mind is way harder for me with strong opioids like Heroin, Oxycodon, Morphine, Tilidin, Tramadol, Codein and all the RC-Opioids that have popped up over the years - you name the opioid, I probably have taken it at some point in my life. I just wasn't functional anymore when I used stuff like this for more than 3-4 days. So it somehow always was quite managable for me to control the use of strong opioids (till November 2021, where I was finally giving zero fucks about my life and my future). But not Kratom. Kratom always has been different. 

My first opioid experiences where with tramadol and fentanyl and somehow they burned their way deep into my mind. I knew back than, when i was nodding off fentanyl - feeling like a always imagined heroin to feel like - that i have to be fucking carefull with this substance class, cause it gave me so much. Opiats where my first love - quite literally actually, I had my first real relationship with a girl few years after I first used Tramadol and Fentanyl - and I didn't want them to become my downfall at the end. 

Kratom was able to give me a similiar effect and at first it seemed like the ""price to pay"" is not so high with Kratom compared to traditional opioid painkillers. Now I know, that it's seemingly soft effect and the forgiving nature of the plant is nothing positive, but instead actually a huge negative, a huge danger for me, because it made daily use over prolonged periods of time possible without beeing broke or dead after a short time. So as the years passed by Kratom slowly creeped it's way into my everyday life and became my Nr. 1 drug of choice. 

The first quits i didn't notice any strong withdrawal symptoms, so i was comfirmed, that it's ok to use it once in a while for multiple days or weeks. I mean I proved to myself, that I can easily kick this habit and carry on with my sober life. I might feel a little bit shitty for a few days, but after one week I was always back on baseline, feeling good. I was in total control of my use. At least I thought so. I didn't notice that most addiction storys start this way. ""If you can stop, you don't want to. If you want to stop - you can't anymore."" It' a very thin and fine line and the effect of Kratom made me blind to it. I didn't see the line anymore. Or maybe i didn't want to see it. Back there I didn't realize that the question is not if i step over this invisible line but rather when. So in the end it was only a matter of time to lose control over my Kratom use. 

When I finally finished my studys in summer 2019 I instantly found what you could call my dream job, helping addicts as a social worker. I was sober for multiple weeks before, but somehow it all went too fast for me. I still had a part time job to finance my studies and basically only had like 5 days off work between the end of this job, my bachelor thesis and the beginning the new job. I was getting kind off pissed about that fact so i thought, well at least you could book some Kratom vacations for the first few days, to make the transition into working life more smooth. Well you all can imagine how this ended. A planned few days holiday escalated into a two years world trip. I underestimated the pressure of everyday working life and the power of Kratom. 

Shortly after starting to work I met my soon to be girlfriend. Things got serious between us very quickly and she basically instantly started her own daily Kratom habit (So drugvise I was probably what you could call classic bad influence :/). Time flew by fast without me really comprehending that I was already using for 3 months straight - I never used any drug this long daily before in my life - and I slowly started to notice I might have a bigger problem than I would like to admit. But being able to take your DOC together with your partner in crime somehow felt... good. Like a real badass. Like I found a cheat code through life and shared it with my girlfriend. In the beginning we were on top of the world. Everything Was fucking awesome. In the end we were in hell's kitchen. Slowly burning up from inside. 

Nevertheless I knew I had to stop using Kratom eventually. I knew this feeling wouldn't last forever. But the thing is, with work you suddenly cannot withdraw so easy like I did many times before during my studies. There is just not enough spare time and in the end you have to function. So I spent my first one week holiday trying to quit. Long story short, I basically ended up using all my holidays in two years of work trying to quit. Quite fucked up considering holiday should be to rest, to go on vacation, to experience nice things. Not to go through the pain and agony of withdrawal, which all of a sudden were much more severe than I used to experience them in the past. Especially the mental part of it. And with every try they seemed to just get worse and worse as my addiction grew stronger and stronger. 

I actually had a pretty good quitting attempt after about one year of daily use. l even managed to go to work completely sober for about a week - something my addicted mind always tried to tell me was not possible (anymore). I proved it to myself, that I could also do it without Kratom, I even felt better than on Kratom, because I was more there. I was more present. I wasn't a slave anymore. This at first felt great but eventually lead me to the (dumb and naive) conclusion, that i could take just one dose in the evening, like other people drink one or two beers after work. You know the drill... As an recovering addict, with just one use, you risk it all, regardless of how good or ""in control"" you feel at that moment. Soon after the first evening dose i started to take it in the morning as well. In the second week only on seemingly more stressfull days, in the third week I was back right where I started before my ""vacation"". I felt beaten. Another battle lost. 

This constant cognitive dissonance, which was always bothering me in the back of my head - back behind the warm curtain Kratom gave me everyday -  probably contributed to the developement of a slowly but steadily growing depression. On top of all, the relationship with my girlfriend got more and more toxic after we left the hooneymoon phase. I wasn' happy anymore. I wanted to get out of this, but just like with my Kratom use I simply couldn't. And then there was this never ending covid-19 shitshow all around us on top of that all. 

With getting back on Kratom I was able to stay in this unhealthy relationship. It numbed the urgency to get out, before it totally escaletes. And the fear of a massive escalarion became imanent as we had some really rough fights. I pushed it away with Kratom during the week and with stronger opioids on the weekends. The result? Nothing to worry. Everything is good, everything is ok. Of course, nothing was ok anymore. And when things start to fall apart and your Illusion of reality becomes cracked - that is like putting oil into the fire of addiction. More problems? More, stronger opioids. Easy call. 

Fast forward to August 2021. Our relationship finally collapsed in a huge disaster with her trying to hold us together with suicidal behaviour. She told me, that I should tell her 5 year old son, that I am the reason why she is dead. She tried to climb out of the windows of my fifth floor apartment and I was holding her back clinged around one foot eventually being able to wrestle her back into my room. There was a lot of fighting and screaming. I had to call the police to get her out of my new appartement - it was just a very traumatic and fucked up break up, something I never ever lived through in the past and I don't ever want to experience in my life again. I was in total shock for more than just this worst day of my life. In a way I am still in shock, at least when I speak or write about what happened. The whole breakup damaged me deeply inside. How could this happen? Why did we have to push our bond this far? How could we hurt each other so, so much? You know the answer. 

I used stronger opioids during the last two years on the weekends mostly. Kratom still worked, but often it wasn't enough any more. So we used stronger stuff nearly every weekend at the most excessive times. As I already told, the thing with stronger opioids is, I can't really take them more than 3-4 days in a row. They really triggered huge cravings and my tolerance would always skyrocket so fast, that it just didn't make any sense to me to use them for longer periods. And of course I was not very keen on becoming full blown addicted to them. After the police took her away from me (I was at day 8 CT at that time, yey) I instantly took a huge dose of Dipyanone (Methadon-analogue with very similiar effects), close to a dangerous OD I guess. I was in my bathtub, close to passing out and nodding of hard. I needed this. I really needed this to stay sane. I never saw here again since that fucked up day straight out of hell. 

Nevertheless after the whole breakup she somehow managed to stay in contact with me and manipulated me in different ways that I just couldn't cut her completly out of my life. So the whole breakup somehow dragged till the beginning of december 2021, where i finally managed to block here (again) on all channels. After the breakup in the summer I developed massive sleeping problems and took Dipyanone more and more, numbing the pain, while still trying to function at work. Of course my collegues started to notice something was not quite right with me. More than once a week I was massively tired and high as a kite at work. I could barely walk straight but shook it all off when I was asked about what was wrong. ""I'm ok. I had a shitty breakup. I am not sleeping well. I can handle this. Everything will be ok..."" Obviously nothing was ok and my collegues got more and more worried about me. 

I had another attempt to quit in Oktober 2021, therefor I took of two weeks of work to finally get my shit together. At the end of my vacation I had a huge and awesome birthday party on Friday, celebrating my new year and my new soberness. During the night my now ex-girlfirend delivered me a very special birthday present in form of some quite mean text messages, which really hit hard. Right there where it hurts the most. Ouch. These messages were the perfect excuse for me to use again. A good friend of mine watched over me crying my heart out the day after the party. Thanks to her I made it another day without using. The day after I instantly relapsed and used Kratom again. This is when I realized, that I can't keep on doing what I do, or I would soon collapse at work at some point. Or worse. It was like all of a sudden the drugs didn't work any more the way I used to know. Probably some kind off burnout mixed with the complete breakout and manifestation of a severe depression, which was growing in me for months before. 

So I went to the doctor and told her that I can't do it anymore. I didn't tell her about my use, because I didn't see myself in a classic long term drug therapy, where most of the people are just there because they are forced to be there by law. Rather therapy than jail. Also I am still not very keen on the Stigma that comes along with being an addict. Either way, all the symptoms I told her matched a classic Depression. I have not been at work since that day. 

Of course I relapsed bad after noticing that my whole life is basically fucked. I didn't give a shit anymore about anything including myself - especially myself - and took, against all principles i had left, Dipyanone for 3 weeks straight, desperatly trying to escape reality in november 2021. I always upped the dose, always felt less and less (relief & effect). After three weeks went by like a blink of the eye where I just watched trash TV, while being heavely sedated all day long, I somehow managed to reach out to a friend, who came to me and took the bad stuff away from me. He might have saved my life this way. I was really loosing myself. Remeber how I told you I always had control over the harder stuff? Well, not anymore I guess. When you got nothing to loose you are more and more willing to risk it all. 

I was so depressed, even while using, I knew that there is no way I'm quitting CT now. After a short revival of Kratom - which of course didn't have any effect at all anymore because of the massive opiate tolerance I developed I decided to get some meds to help me get through the withdrawal. I still don't know, if this was a huge mistake. I mean Lyrica really is a beast against accute withdrawals, Benzos really helped me get some sleep, but in the end they somehow triggered something new inside me: The constant need for any substance, just to make it through the day without taking Kratom or any other opioid.

Even with the meds the withdrawal was pretty cruel and just dragged on and on. Also I was getting afraid of becoming physically dependant on Benzos, which i had used for about 3 weeks straight, which is as I know quite a critical duration, espacially when taking those high dose you need in withdrawal. After getting close to the 20 day mark I relapsed again with Kratom. Just one time. One good day won't hurt, it won't set you back so far. You all probably know how it feels giving in to the devils speech. 

So i used, maybe one day, maybe two and than got back on other drugs. Staying completly sober was just not an option anymore. Not with all this pain and misery surrounding me all the time. Of course after a short relapse the withdrawals always got stronger again. That was basically my story till now. 1-2 weeks opioid and kratom free (with cycling use of other drugs), 1-2 days relapse on Kratom or other opioids. A never ending circle. Even though I just used about 6-8 times in close to two months (or because I used inbetween?) it felt like I have been in constant withdrawal since December 2021. Like withdrawal is my new state of normal. That's fucked up. 

Last Week i had no other drugs left and felt absoluetly rock bottom. Well. Basically for the last weeks I felt like every new day marks a new rock bottom for me... Everytime you think you couldn't feel more shitty life always dragged me down further into the endless void. I just couldn't take it any longer. So I decided that it might be better to get back on Kratom than taking all those other drugs, I don't even like the effects of. That Kratom is more foregiving and I'm doing less harm to myself this way. Kind of a funny story, that I took all those other Drugs in the first place, to help me stay off, to help me quit Kratom for good. A classic paradox i guess. I thought i might just use it as a tool to make it to some kind of therapy and not as a drug to numb me. Somehow I still justify this relapse this way even though deep inside I know it's probably bullshit. 

So im back on Kratom again for a good week now. The first days where like taking a vacation from my depression. I experienced a huge mood lift. The huge weight on my shoulders just vanished. I kind off started to function again, smiling, laughing, enjoying life. But deep inside i know, using Kratom is not the way to get my life back. It's just very tempting to take the easy way out. But Kratom certainly contributed a great part to this whole mess I call my life now. Because it just works so good. Because i like its effect so much. But this doesn't work. I still crave other drugs, especially harder opioids. More than before my relapse. 

Kratom doesn't work anymore. It keeps me locked in one place. There is no progress, there is no growth. You stay exactly where you are and are content with it. And a few days ago I noticed: I don't fucking want to stay in this miserable depressed state. Not beeing able to work. Not being able to really love and to really live. Not being able to actually feel things. Embracing all the Emotions. Not numbing than. Again. And again. And again. I'm so sick and tired of this. Of waking up in withdrawal. Of having to think about the next dose all the time. Of giving in to my addiction. Again. And again. I finally have to push through and the only way is by learning how to live completly sober again. So I know I have to quit. Once and for all. For good. Writing this I'm shaking my head, smiling, because I know how often i felt this way in the last two years. How often I tried. Yet everytime I failed. Why would this time be any different? 

Well there actually might be more than one reason. I have time now and no obligations with work. I started ambulant psychotherapy at the end of 2021, a setting where I feel safe to also talk about my drug use. I plan to go in a semi-stationary therapy concept (therapy 8-16 o clock while staying at my place in the evening and on weekends) in a few weeks to learn how to live with my depression and my addiction and how to get better without the use of psychoactive substances. To establish a new daily routine, that's not centered around taking Kratom or any other drug. 

I really want my life back. I want to gain a new perspective that goes further than when it's time to take the next dose. I want to grow. That's what still keeps me going after all those failed attempts to quit. At least I haven't lost all hope yet. Even though it's really hard to get back up when you have fallen a hundred times over the same rock. Why even bother getting up again? Because there is still fire in me burning. Because I believe there is more to life, more to explore. Because I am deeply convinced I can live a better life than this. Because i still have faith in me. Somewhere. 

I went down the rabbit hole. Now it's time to get back up again. I can do this. I know I can. But I realized I can't make it on my own anymore. I need a guiding hand. Support. Advice. Real human connections. 

And right there, when i was completly hopeless, once again hitting a new rock bottom, suddenly this amazing woman came into my life. She loves me for what I really am - a person even I myself can' t see anymore, the person I have burried under all those drugs - a lovely person. One of the good ones out there. Don't get me wrong, I want this for myself and am not doing this for her. But she certainly can hold my hand and help me find a way out of here. But she won't wait forever. She can't. Watching me suffering, destroying myself. I want to be able to give her something back for all that she has done for me this far. I want to be able to actually love her the same way she loves me. Therefore I first have to find a way to love myself again. And I tell you, it's really fucking hard to love this mess of a man. How the hell is she doing this?! There must be something I don't see, that I can't see anymore. The good in me. Time to find it again I guess. 

Of course there are many doubts. I relapsed and withdrew so many times in the last two years. I don't want to drag her into this misery and I don't want her to get hurt by me and my mental problems. I don't want to fail. Again. But at the moment I guess I am on the right track. I just have to stop, before another two years move by, not really living, just being there, an empty shell of my former self. Before my whole life is wasted in the constant search for the next high. The next relief from our often so cruelsome existance. I somehow have to learn, how to deal with this fucked up world around me and this fucked up world inside of me. And I have to burry my most favourite coping strategy: Daily Kratom use. And then I have to replace it with something, that is truely good for my body and my mind. Because there will be a huge hole, that's for sure. 

I really hope that I'm finally ready for not taking the easy way out anymore. I feel like the time for change has come. I'm afraid. But it's okay to be afraid. It's ok. 

I want to live and I want to be free. 

Free of this pain and misery.

Finally free.

The last couple of months I have been really demotivated to draw and work on my online shop. I have adhd so I thought it could be that, but it also might be kratom. What I don’t like is that I need to watch shows, read books, and play games normally to inspire me, but I can’t enjoy any of that anymore. That began like 3 months ago. 

I have a chronic illness and Kratom really helps me with the pain and energy to do things, the problem is, I am so focused on drawing that I forget other stuff, and I actually don’t enjoy drawing as I did, I think all my ideas are bad, and that I don’t do it go.

I have been some days without kratom before, and the pain, the restless legs (I already have chronic restless leg syndrome due to my illness), shivers, and emotional imbalances are so heavy that I am scared to quit, because when I quit Kratom, I know I will go back to that pain and tiring live going to sleep at 20pm, pain when I wake up and tired even when I sleep 12 hours. I am actually even excersising again. 

But I feel like Kratom has made me sort of lifeless, and I don’t enjoy doing things I might have enjoyed before and my productivity is even less than before because of the fog in my head. 

There is no other medication that helps me with pain as Kratom does, and I want to quit Kratom so bad! But I also want to live a painless life, so I don’t know what to do 😭 

I am sorry for this post.

Maybe someone in this reddit with the same problem as me has quit kratom and can give me his/her experience?

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life, as well as lack of motivation and distractibility, impulsivity, etc. Kratom made all my symptoms better. At least somewhat. Now however I am going to therapy and getting proper medication from a psychiatrist. I'm on Adderall and Prozac. Things are getting much better. I quit using cannabis 6 weeks ago at the recommendation of my psychiatrist. He said it was probably contributing to depression and brain fog. It was actually fairly easy. I know this is not the case for many people. So I consider myself lucky. 
I've cut way back on the alcohol too. Now I feel like I don't really need kratom, but for some reason I feel very attached to it. 
Yesterday though I forgot to drink any Kratom in the afternoon. I was just feeling good and didn't feel the drop in energy or mood that usually prompts me to have more. I usually drink 3 cups of kratom tea a day. I started to feel really achy all over and just felt bad and depressed. I drank some tea and it all went away very quickly. This tells me that I am physically dependent on Kratom. Not a very happy thought. 
Anyway, I want to quit using kratom, but I know I'm going to have to wean myself off it. Any advice would be appreciated. I use about 10 grams per day currently. Thanks.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976205229759216}"

Never again.,"I can't believe I waited this long to get off of the sludge. I feel so alive, so great. I look back at myself and feel like I wasted 5 years of my life being someone I'm not. Even though I accomplished a lot of amazing things during that time (got married, had children, in grad school) I think it would have been so much different without kratom being in the back of my mind all that time. 

For the record, yes I have used it for five years daily, averaging 10gpd at the lowest and closer to 25-30 gpd at the highest. In early January I tapered immensely down from about 10 to 1 gpd and then 0.5 gpd and then 0.25 gpd. This was the worst part, and I just wanted to lay in bed all day and not do anything. When I was off of it completely I actually did not feel terrible withdrawal symptoms and nothing near as bad as the taper, so I feel pretty lucky about that...part of the reason I was afraid of quitting for the last year or so is because of the horror stories I have read. 

But the biggest takeaway is this: even if I have the sheer willpower of being able to stop taking kratom, it's not real until I realize the harm it has done to me. If I thought it was still beneficial, I would never able to stay sober-- just as with alcohol and nicotine and substances. Every day I wake up I realize I feel much better physically, mentally, and emotionally, and I feel in control, and then I think that this would not be true if I still using (these feelings started after being off completely for about a week). This type of thought process is what allowed me to fully quit without feeling the need to take ""just a small dose"" again. I simply want nothing to do with it anymore.

Day one was awful. I had it all going on…RLS in my whole body, stomach cramps, nausea, hot/cold flashes and depression.

Today I’d say I am 60% better. Still having waves but also seeing some windows too. For the first time in 5 years I am starting to see little pin holes of light. I have no desire at all to take any kratom, but like another poster said, now I just don’t want to be sober bc the feels are hard to cope with. But the only thing I’ve used that is considered a crutch is delta 8 at night. Truly helps the rls which is one of the main lingering withdrawal symptoms along with stomach issues. 

All in all I am doing alright. Day one was definitely the worst for me but each day has gotten easier.

Other helper meds and supps I am using are:

Liposomal Vit C, Mag glycinate, gabapentin, L-tyrosine, Sam-E, and L-theanine. Seems to be helping but it’s hard to tell some moments. Can’t completely escape withdrawals and I accept that. Need a little suffering to be reminded of why I don’t ever want to do this again.

I  started taking kratom about 3 years ago. Beginning with capsules but  finding myself buying powdered in bulk so I can instead just mix in  water and slam down. At the peak I was taking \~25-30gpd, however I've  been cutting back for some time now and I am recently at 10-12gpd.

I stay up to date on my doctors appointments and although *technically*  nothing is standing out as a health issue I have seen several negative  side effects that are a big bummer. Losing the rest of my already  thinning hair, muscle mass decrease, brain fog and more recently a  pretty severe stutter right after taking a dose. I am tired of sneaking  away from my wife to throw down a quick teaspoon of mud. I am tired of  throwing away money at something that only hurts me and my  relationships. But more importantly I am a new father to a beautiful 3.5  month old baby girl, and I just don't want her to grow up seeing dada  addicted to anything like this.

I  am starting my taper down from this \~12gpd habit and planning to  hopefully just jump ship once I reach that 2.5gpd/one dose a day mark.  I've got my magnesium, valerian root and THC ready to help with these  withdrawal symptoms and my family at my side to help get through this  hump.

Day 12ish I was pretty much just about back to normal besides lingering fatigue. I actually haven’t really had any depression like I see a lot when people quit. I feel like I was more depressed when I was taking it. I did have return of the back pain I was using the Kratom to treat but oh well. Felt confident enough to leave one job to go to another painting cars again but of course my Multiple Sclerosis landed me in the hospital from over doing it. Not sure if I have pancreatitis again either, worst abdominal pain like the first time I had it as well as hurts to eat and the worst diarrhea. Unless the diarrhea is just catching up to me now because up until yesterday since being on Kratom and quitting Kratom I haven’t went to the bathroom much. Hospital didn’t check my liapse levels so I’ll have to follow up for blood work to see what’s going on. Other then that, I feel like that cloud has been lifted and I don’t have to worry about weighing out a dose before bed to take first thing in the morning just to get out of bed. 

I also cold ct’ed right after I felt ok from Covid where I was probably taking more around 40-50gpds. I’ve kicked other opiates from oxys to heroin years ago but this seemed a bit worst for some reason. The first couple days were pretty rough, the worst headaches ever, a lot of nausea and a lot of restlessness. I take gabapentin and klonopin for my MS but my body is immune to my dosage and I’ve tried coming off gabapentin before and I wasn’t upping it and dancing with that devil again. I did take some extra benzos here and there as well as baclofen and clonidine a few times (all prescribed meds). But nothing really truly got me out of bed the first couple days without feeling like fainting. I stayed away from caffeine and I stopped my adderal to possibly decrease the anxiety. Slept a decent amount during the day for the first few days and a little bit at night with the help of 100mgs of trazodone. 

If you see yourself struggling, you got this. I have a fucked up central nervous system as it is and I was able to break free. I’ll post again maybe at 30 days.

I know of every supplement and of all of the effects in the brain. I’m aware that this is like coming off an SSRI, SNRI, and an opiate. I’ve lurked around here so much that I know of or have everything in my possession supplements-wise, weighted blanket, etc. Only thing I don’t have is clonidine, but I could probably find a way to get it. 

I have taken lamictal (anticonvulsant) and Klonopin daily for years. I don’t need a refresher course on how addictive benzos are and their withdrawal. I’m beyond aware of the situation I am in with that regard. Because of the benzo situation, I cannot tell a medical prescriber about my Kratom use. If you don’t know, the second you are flagged as a drug seeker, they rip you off benzos despite them needing a multi year taper at my dose/duration. This is to be avoided at all costs. I hate to sound like a professor about this but I’ve put a hundred hours into research on this.

What I fear is the SSRI/SNRI like withdrawals. Before Kratom, I was a housebound wreck. After Kratom, I likely will be too. I’m not having a problem with tapering besides panic about the future and crying throughout the day.

What I need is friends. Because of isolation, I don’t have many. I need people to reign me in and encourage me. I can help others too, but I’m all alone and no one but other Kratom users can understand this. My OCD, anxiety, and depression are bad enough as it is and I can’t do this alone.

Please, will someone help me? I know this sounds so selfish, but I have nowhere else to turn to.

I'll be honest,  I feel very lucky that so far I have felt very mild physical symptoms.   The first 3 days I had mild temperature fluctuations,  mild sour stomach,  and mild cold/flu like symptoms.   The only time I would really notice them was when I would lie down to sleep.  The night of day 3 was the worst.   It has been the only time so far that I really felt like I was in trouble of using again.   Luckily the first day I forced myself to flush all the powder I had left.   Of course I had that voice in my head that told me I should save it so I can use ""controllably"" in a few weeks,  but was able to ignore it and flush everything.   Had I not done that, I most likely would have used again that night.   I am glad I didn't.   I tossed and turned for hours until finally I was able to get a bit if sleep and once I woke up the cravings were gone.  

All in all the physical symptoms for me have been almost non existent.  I am definitely feeling the effects of the insomnia, so In think with the proper preparation this whole thing could have been relatively painless.  Getting something for sleep would have been a good idea.

In the beginning I could cut more but as withdrawals hit I decided to follow this plan. I take it twice a day so each dose is decreased by .25 grams. I decided on the long and slow method of getting to 0 kratom. 

A few weeks ago I noticed after every taper drop usually the day or two after I sleep like crazy. I’ve started taking my first reduced dose at night hoping to sleep through some of any initial withdrawals. The issue is it’s gotten worse this last drop that started on my second dose of kratom on February 4th. 

Supplements I take: magnesium, potassium, ashgwanda, vitamin d and a men’s multivitamin. 

It’s really gotten in the way of my functioning. I’m disabled with severe chronic pain so doing anything is already so hard and this sleepiness is so bad. It’s a shame too my withdrawals had generally decreased significantly since my psychiatrist prescribed me more clonidine for the withdrawals. I told my psychiatrist that I was tapering off kratom and for help with it. 

I’m taking every other comfort medication out there legally prescribed for my chronic pain so there’s not much more I can do there. 

I just find it messes up my sleep schedule and makes me depressed and not productive and just causes me so many issues oversleeping to this extent. Like I don’t mind falling asleep at 10pm as long as I’m up by 11am but sleeping till 2 pm and then feeling so brain fogged and groggy I can’t do anything isn’t a good time. 

Any tips for what to do? Other people recommended drop by .1gpd and while that would probably help it seems like a huge pain I’m already having trouble measuring exactly 3.75 grams.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995924830436707}"

I dose 2grams every 3 hrs with plenty of water. So I've never had any major constipation. I also make it into tea. 

Anyways I'm tired of taking this shit. I know I don't need any drugs to feel happy. I started taking because of depression and having a hard time getting out bed in the morning. My job is also 10hrs/day and is very physical so Kratom has helped me a lot. But Kratom is a bandaid not a cure. I think it's a great plant but shouldn't be used everyday for years. 

Tldr:
I quit (almost) CT 48 hrs ago. I did take 0.5 grams that I had left in my car but I don't count it because I barely felt it.

The physical withdrawl symptoms are gone but the depression is coming in hot. For the past 4 days it is just getting more and more severe. I understand that my brain is making changes and figuring out how to naturally make dopamine and serotonin again, but I'm feeling really hopeless. Luckily I'm not even thinking about relapse because I'm not willing to ever go through this again. But I'm so nervous. I never really experienced true depression until now. I feel it in every cell of my body. My happiness is gone. Every moment of every day is debilitating. Standing up to walk to the kitchen is exhausting. I can't make myself eat. Constant sadness. No positive outlook. I'm even to the point of thinking....how do I know life is better without kratom? Like, if this feeling is the alternative...how is this better? Who can live like this? 
I can't feel like this forever. I know it may take a while to get better, and I know nothing will happen over night. But how do I know this isn't the feeling I was avoiding by taking kratom? What if this is what I will feel like forever? What if it doesn't get better? How do I cope with this hopelessness while being a stay at home mom of a 3 year old and 6 month old? What if I'm not as good if a parent without kratom because depression and exhaustion is the alternative? What if over the years I've effed up my brain so much that I can never feel real again. 

Can you see where my head is? 
Please. Please...someone tell me that this is not a permanent state of mind. Please tell me this isn't what life is supposed to feel like. I'm so scared that my life of addiction over the years (not just with kratom) has me convinced that euphoria is what I'm supposed to feel, so nothing else feels good anymore. I'm so mad at myself. I fucking hate addiction. 

As of now I don't do any drugs, but I am prescribed an antidepressant that I've been taking because of post partum depression (the meds took it away, but now depression coming back 10 fold) and ritalin for adhd (which I take responsibility)....but nothing else. 
I don't think I can say I'm sober since I'm on ritalin...but fuck. Fuck fuck fuck. 

I'm not suicidal, but I finally understand why people with severe depression think about suicide. If this is the only other reality, death could feel like an escape. 

Please I am begging for anything. Any tips and recommendations to help me get through this depression. Any little thing I can do every day to help. Anything. I don't want to become dependant on anything though, like supplements. Willing to try vitamins but I don't want to screw myself in the long run and have to get off something else that I've been coping with.

I've realized kratom has one major difference over everything else I've used daily... it's ability to mask other health issues.

I knew my health was bad and getting worse, but I could just take another dose and feel great again.

Everything else I've taken daily didn't have this effect (weed, smokes, Adderall, aniracetam, modafinil), once the health issues started coming up I had to feel them and live with them. 

**Kratom was really good at masking health issues caused by kratom.**

This, in my opinion, is a huge reason it's so addictive. After long-term use, our bodies are basically sick, and the only thing that relieves those symptoms is more kratom.

Of course by the final 6 months of my addiction, dosing again wasn't helping. By that point kratom had drained so much of my health I knew I was in a lose-lose scenario and it was useless to keep using.

With this realization, the long term PAWS makes more sense to me, because without the kratom masking my poor health, I probably wouldn't have let it slip this far.

Now I have to deal with recovering from a sick body and mind, not just my receptors in my brain repairing themselves, but abuse to many parts of my body from the kratom.

There's a strong reason why this is important.

Our addict brain tells us kratom will make us feel good again, but more accurately the kratom was the thing making us sick in the first place, and taking more kratom would temporarily relieve us from the symptoms of being sick.

Very important nuance.

Maybe some of you were different, but when I started kratom I could easily take or leave it once or twice here and there with zero desire to take again, it was only once it became a daily habit long enough to start making me sick that addiction gripped its teeth into me.

Yes physical dependence and withdrawal is a thing (and a hell of one), but I wonder how much of that is really us just finally feeling the full extent of our masked health issues?",10,{'mask': 4},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9877980351448059}"

I was just in to much pain in my back and legs to where I couldn't get out of bed. I was 12 days ct from 50-60 gpd. The pain and depression just wasn't letting up at all. So even though I really didn't want to I had to take some. I'm planning on getting myself stable over the weekend and then I'm going to try to taper down. I think I just shocked my body to much with ct cause I'm not in good health anyway. I'm just hoping I can taper. And I hope my pain just hasn't gotten so bad that I'll always have to take something cause I don't want to take kratom no more. Every time I dose now I can barely get it down and I use capsules. Just the thought of it makes me sick and I hate the time when it comes I have to take it. It's just so hard for me to taper cause I am an addict. I have a very addictive personality and I know that but it's still hard to control. I'm going to see Monday if my aunt will help me with the taper but she's usually gone on the weekend so I don't know what I'd do on the weekend. But I figured maybe she could hold it for me and give my doses each day so I don't take extra. If it comes to where my pain won't let me be off everything I don't know what I'll do cause I do have side effects from kratom and is one reason why I want to quit but the drs only wants to give me subs which I don't want cause that's what I came off last year. I'm hoping with tapering my body will have more time to adjust and hopefully the pain will be manageable. I just couldn't believe I was 12 days in and still having withdrawal the way I was. But I feel like I failed myself and everyone else just because I couldn't take it no more. I honestly could've handled everything else but the pain I couldn't take no more. And even though I've dosed for 2 days I'm still having cold sweats and chills at night and insomnia but I think it might be cause I'm not taking as much as before. It's close cause my tolerance didn't drop that much which surprised me but I would think it would have stopped all wd but I'm still having those. I'll keep everyone updated on my taper. I'm going to try to take it slow but I want off this asap. I'm thinking about trying vitamin c next time I just don't want it to tear my stomach up cause this wd my insides felt like they were being ripped out but I've seen a lot of people talk about vitamin c helping. I tried gabapentin this time and the only thing it helped was to help me sleep the first couple nights.

Anxiety Waves.,"Although when I think of how I felt on week 1 I can honestly say I have made so much progress. It’s frustrating because I thought I would be done by now. I feel great at this very moment, but am still very prone to get attacks of anxiety. It’s the type of anxiety where I feel disassociated with myself and get blurred vision and feel all the bad thoughts racing. It’s a essentially a panic attack and a lingering anxiety. It’s important to note I quit smoking cigarettes almost 4 weeks ago. I quit THC the same day as kratom. I think quitting these three habits close together almost shocked my system. I have never had bad anxiety ever in my life until I came across kratom. However I feel good most of the time. I just have to take the right vitamins and eat food in small healthy portions. If I get drunk, eat any large amounts of junk food, or don’t get the right amount of sleep, I will be much more prone to anxiety the next 24 hours. I will tell you the days I workout, eat right, and drink a lot of green tea and water I feel great. I think quitting Kratom and nicotine together made my digestive system just stop. I have a big appetite with the cravings so I just have to be careful with what I eat. I have been taking fish oil, magnesium, ashwaganda, vitamin c, vitamin d, and herbal immune system teas daily. I’m thinking about adding NAC to the mix. I think PAWS is very real so doing what I can to combat it. It’s been a valiant effort and ardent struggle this far, and I believe I am winning although some days I feel like I am losing. I made it through the holidays in December, won the battle of January. Now it’s time for the battle of February. I feel once I make it to the warm sunny weather life will be much easier. I have heard many success stories of how it took people 3 months plus to feel better. If you are struggling in this battle and losing hope, keep up the fight.

I was lying to myself, my family and sneaking doses behind their back. I am on day 8 of no kratom. I went from 16gpd and started going as long as I could between doses before I had too much stress from withdrawals(seems I could go approx 24 hrs)This process took about 3-4 days and I had to take about a gram to get some sleep for first 3 days. First 5 days CT were painful and restless, but so worth it now. I took magnesium and advil to help with the back pain. I finally woke up today with no pain and very little jitters. I added in 30 mins of exercise inthe AM and started Wim Hof method when I was really hurting(seriously insane how this works, fairly easy to learn with his free app.) I am starting to feel like a real person again and I have had more feelings of connection with my wife and kids than I have in a while.

I lost sexual energy and wasn’t even really interested in sex. I was dosing 3-4g every damn 4 hours, no wonder I couldn’t feel anything.

I have been abusing kratom for 4 years. It was really bad about 2 years ago when I was shoveling tablespoons of powder in my mouth 8 times a day. I was able to quit for a short time. Withdrawals were hell but I got better day by day.

Fast forward 2 months and I have horrible stomach pains. Not nausea, not diarrhea, just uncomfortable. Thought maybe kratom can help? And guess what? It did.

Soon I was taking it every few days. Being responsible!

Until Covid hit. I have a great job where I got to travel the world and always work on exciting projects. Being stuck in the house with 3 little kids was a huge change and super stressful. I started taking kratom again to cope.

This time I was a little smarter and stuck to capsules. Probably averaging 10–15g a day. It helped my get a burst of energy in the morning but by afternoon I felt like shit. Total zombie for my wife and kids.

Add I’m also prescribed Ambien so after the kratom started to wear off all I could look forward to is the quick ambien trip before bed. 9am lights out. Would be up groggy at 3 or 4am to start the process all over again.

I’m so sick of being dependent. Sick of needing a drug to spend time with my kids. Hate hiding it. Especially we go on trips. We travel a lot and I always need to make an excuse to my wife why I need to run out (I’m really just going to buy some K or if we are in a country that’s it’s not prevalent some painkillers)

I had a business meeting out of state yesterday so decided to extend my trip to try to clean myself out. My wife’s family is visiting so I don’t feel to guilt about leaving her with the kids. I packed no ambien and no kratom. First night I had no sleep but was ok yesterday. Just super tired. 

I told a friend I couldn’t sleep and they gave me a klonnopin last night. That helped tons. Slept a good few hours. Woke up and went for a run.

Right now I feel like I have a mild flu. Not as bad as my last quit but not fun. My biggest issue seems to be the boredom. So bored in this hotel room.

I’m on the Mexican border so could pop down but am afraid I’ll buy some tramadol there since it’s legal.

Not sure if it's because I would switch strains all the time, expected this to be the same as opiate withdrawal, or if I just got lucky, but I honestly feel pretty good.  Hopefully I can get some sleep and won't be telling yall that I'm feeling terrible tomorrow. 

Edit:  I made my original post yesterday asking if anyone had delayed withdrawals after taking high doses for long periods.  Several people basically were saying brace yourself,  the terrible withdrawals are coming.  So I was joking about the sorry to disappoint and just realized it made no sense without context.

I’ve been commenting a bunch on here but this is my first post.  I’ve been tapering from 25-30gpd - found a starting point at 15 and am now down to 7 (will be dropping to 6 come Sunday, as I’m now dropping a gram a week).  I’ve been only using capsules since I never liked them when I was frequently using due to reduced potency, and had a really good rhythm going.  This week, in an anxious moment, I took my nightly dose in powder instead of capsules.  I definitely felt the effects, and now in the three days following, have been feeling significantly worse - and last night, I took my nightly dose in powder again because of the anxiety.

My question is - although downing the powder is a more potent method of taking it, is it affecting my withdrawal process this much?  Or is this just my body having a rough week due to the nature of withdrawal, and the powder vs capsules doesn’t really matter since it’s the same dose?  I’m going to stick to capsules but just curious as of course my brain is now saying “well just take your dose in powder if you’re super anxious.”  I should also mention that the powder was a different strain than the capsules, which may be why it had increased effects as well.

Appreciate anyone’s advice and this group has been super helpful - I haven’t broken my taper schedule but just want to know if I’m making it harder on myself!

(And its also probly improved)
I felt like I owed it to this subreddit to make an update after my last post and how bad it sounded. I was getting some suicidal thoughts but they're gone now. I make sure that I'm not drinking too much coffee so that my anxiety doesn't spike. Also, staying hydrated is important. I've been adding Himalayan sea salt and lemon juice to the water I drink and I like to think that that's doing something. I'm also taking some Chinese liver cleanse pills that I found in my cabinet. I know a lot of people swear by their supplements and what not and I wanted to feel included so I grabbed these pills from my cabinet and decided to take them at this time. It can't hurt to fill your body with chinese herbs though, can it? Anyway, my sense of humor is coming back so that's good. I think today is probably a good day and tomorrow will be a bad day, if I remember the last time I detox on this crap, the days like to play good cop bad cop.

I posted on this sub a couple months back just detailing how I was trying to quit.

Well, I didn't. But at the same time I made the commitment in my mind. I knew that I \*wanted\* to quit. I knew that if I didn't quit, I would lose my sense of self and what I wanted to achieve for years. I mean IM 20!!! Not even 21! I just got out of fucking high school not even like 3-4 years ago, and even then I didn't complete it. After leaving HS at 16, I become an insane weightlifter and felt ready to tackle the world just trying to find a job so I can actually devote myself to something greater than me.

I got all of that. I got the job, I got the nice ride, I got the nice apartment, and yet kratom took two years away from me. It started out harmless, I would take before a workout and WAM I got so much energy!!! Then I took at my job, I got so much social confidence somehow!!  


Well, it's funny. Because it wasn't actually real. It's all fake. Everything K gives you is fake I've come to realize. In the two years since I started kratom, I've been un-commited to working out fully and have not made a PR for like 3 years. I am OK at my job, but nothing special like I intended when I was sober. Kratom made me this different person that I really can't even recognize anymore... and it's honestly really scary how addictive this stuff can be. It's fucking terrifying that I still feel it in my stomach, even though I'm currently on day three cold turkey. I started taking extracts a couple of months back and that was a HUGE mistake on my part, I would take power in the morning, after lunch, and then when I came back home I'd buy an extract bottle. Totaling probably around 20-40 grams per day. That is on the high-ish scale, not like insane like some people though. I am very sorrowful if you take more than 100grams of kratom a day, at that point I wouldn't even want to imagine WD.

  
Anyways, day 3. Going on day four tomorrow. I think I might have really just jumped off of it and won the war in my head telling me I should buy some kratom. I'm tired, and I just have no motivation right now. I cannot believe that I've wasted all this time and stopped working out. I wish I never even found this plant existed, my entire family line is addicted to drugs (specifically opiates, I have like at least 10 cousins closely related) who are addicted to heroin. Some people just cannot handle this stuff, and some people shouldn't take it because it's not even nessacary. I was never in pain before I started taking K. I had other ways I could have consciously chose that wouldve been healthier to achieve the same goal that taking kratom was to me. I'm so fucking mad at this plant dude and I cannot wait to leave this behind me. I went to the smoke shop today, and bought a delta 8 preroll cause i love weed. and man, it felt good knowing i wasnt gonna buy kratom there too. i felt powerful. i realized we all have control, no matter what.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8525691032409668}"

I didn't realize such ""infrequent"" use could cause such suffering. When I took Kratom at the 2 week point, I immediately recovered within an hour. 


The mistake I made was continuing the Kratom and dosing higher and higher. I just didn't care. And I didn't equate it as bad as the percs.

My question is- does the fact that I was on percs before mean that my receptors are more bonded and the withdrawals from the Kratom will be just as bad as from the percs?

I have been at 20 grams recently. Some days the last few months I have definitely gone up to 30.  If over the next few weeks I slowly reduce my dosage, will the ""jump off"" be easier than cold turkey now?

Those first couple of weeks were a nightmarish hellscape of physical acutes and extreme mental battles. I don't say this to discourage anyone from taking the leap. If I could make it through at least that, so can you.

The title says 1.5 years of use, but for context, I had used for almost 3 years, and had a 3 month break in between before my relapse. That was my first quit, and I had yet to learn just how serious this addiction can be, just how much it can take from you, and that I can't just ""take one dose since it's been so long"".

Coming up on a month and I can say without a shadow of a doubt, I am much better off now than I was at the beginning, and certainly better than when I was using. My confidence is coming back, my personality is healing, my emotions are leveling out, and my creativity, which is so incredibly important to me, has made a huge comeback.

I know that recovery is not linear, and I know it's a path that must be walked consciously and wearily. With that being said, things do get better, PAWS can suck sometimes but it's still majorly better than using. The shame and guilt fall away, your body starts to heal, and all that's left is to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

My relationship with my partner is in a better place than it's ever been, and that makes me so happy to see her happy. There are things that make sober life worth living.

I spend the next week or so doing 4-6 grams of kratom. First few days are bliss. Next few it stops working so well. Last few I realize my default state has been severely depleted. I re-realize I can’t keep doing this and decide ‘no more.’ I quit. Then I feel like complete shit for 3-4 days and takes about a full week to feel normal again. 

Then I go anywhere between 3-12 weeks clean. At some point I forget everything I learned for whatever reason, and I end up at the kratom store. Rinse and repeat.

I've been attempting to taper for many months and sometimes make a little progress but slip back into rationalizing use soon enough. ""kratom plan"" would remain the one thing on my to do list I'd always push back to next week. I struggle with ADD and depression and the whole WD process seemed to make my life unmanageable. I was on 25 gpd with random binge days maybe up to 35 g. 

I started taking 5mg of memantine a day and in less than a week I've pretty painlessly gotten down to 14 gpd and will continue to cut 2g a day till I'm off. When I first tried tapering my mood was so unstable I was so emotionally disoriented. Memantine has pretty much totally blocked the mood swings, I've had very little anxiety and depression just fatigue. No physical pain either. It is very similar to agmatine but much stronger and more consistent throughout the day. Memantine can have a little bit of it's own anxiety that feels like amphetamine or something on the come up but it's not too bad. It feels a little like a ketamine afterglow in the background all the time. A few times it's given me this expansive empathetic connection with people feeling, it feels like it's helping my brain reset to how it's supposed to work instead of just blocking the deficit like something like gabapentin or benzos. I am now optimistic and determined! I will get my brain back from kratom, and soon!

I will warn that it's a pretty odd and heavy drug though. It has an extremely long half life, 60-100hrs. It can be abused but only if you're a dissociative freak willing to endure a k hole like experience for over 24hrs. Abuse wise I think it's safer than gabapentin.

Please please please check for any deficiencies, as nutrition plays an extreme role in mental health, more than you think. Exercise if you can - even just a walk. My first month in withdrawal was agony, I walked 24/7 and went to the track daily to run. It immensely helped. In fact I would call nutrition and exercise crucial - if not mandatory.

I dont know what to do im really thinking about getting back on it but I feel so bad letting my friends and family down after telling them i quit.

and I am already sick as crap. I tried tapering for all of 2021 but I was in denial that it was going to be that bad and the benefits (pain relief) were better than quitting.

Well I am pretty sure I’ve been dealing with tolerance withdrawals for the last two months as I tried a little harder to stick to the taper. Then I got sick for a couple of days and chalked it up to covid or flu. Now I am pretty certain it was w/d’s but instead of maintaining the taper I went back up to around 15 gpd and stayed there a few days. I was still not feeling great. 

Some might remember me asking about quitting during receiving Spravato (esketemine). I tried a couple of sessions while trying to taper but it was too much. I was afraid to stop my treatments bc I had been on the waitlist since August. 

By happenstance the clinical called me and said my meds were delayed and that I couldn’t come in this week and probably not next. 

So all excuses gone, I made the decision last night. And boy oh boy it’s a good thing I gave my kratom to my wife this morning. I feel it, I’m feeling it hard. My stomach is very upset, muscle aches all over and of course bad rls. 

I’ve been on this stuff since 2017- anywhere between 20-40 gpd. I didn’t measure the first couple of years. But the last few it’s been between 15-25gpd. The last couple of months it been between 5-20gpd, varying a lot bc of really trying to taper. 

So bottomline is I can’t count on myself to taper. But I am definitely tired of being sick one way or another.

I am going to do this. I am doing this. Thanks if you got this far. I’ve been lurking since I started kratom trying NOT to get in this predicament. Haha- jokes on me! 

PS I do have most of the medication and supplements always suggested here 👍🏼

I'm about 7 months 10 days out from my quit day. I used kratom for about 14.5 years. I used prescription opiates and poppy pods for about 10 years prior to switching to kratom. So I have a long history here and I'm sure my opiate receptors are fried.

I jumped off 7 months, 10 days ago from 15GPD after a long taper where I was in constant WD for several months prior to jumping. Finally ripped off the band-aid and got it over with. Just sick of the constant WD that drug on for months. 

Anyways, about 10 days after jumping, I started LDN (low dose naltrexone) in hopes that it would help with PAWS and help 'heal' my receptors some. It certainly helped with PAWS, the first day I took 0.35mg of naltrexone, and in just hours, I started to feel better.

Over a period of 6 weeks, I ended up at 0.75mg. After a month there, I tried increasing to 1.5mg, but got no better relief, still in rough shape at this point. However, I was much worse without the naltrexone. I went back down to 0.75mg. After about another month at that dose, I had mostly stabilized. Most days were good, brain fog mostly gone, etc. Still had occasional runny nose, diarrhea,  RLS and anxiety, but those days were the exception.

Fast forward to 1.5 weeks ago. Decided I felt good enough, it was time to start cutting back the naltrexone. Trying not to take anything I don't need. So that Sunday, I cut my dose from 0.75mg to 0.7mg. Yes, I only decreased the dose by 0.05mg. First day no difference, but by the second day, I felt like crap. By the third day at 0.7mg, I was in really rough shape. Bad anxiety, yawns, no energy, just felt like I got hit by a truck. I shit my pants several times and that stopped after month 2 of CT. The cold intolerance is back at 100% and I'm freezing my ass off.

By the next Sun (1 week since last drop), I went ahead and dropped an additional 0.1mg. So I've been at 0.6mg now for 3-4 days. WD symptoms were getting worse this week, but took everything I had in me to drag my butt out of bed to feed the cats this am. I feel worse now than I did last week.

I'd heard the LDN helped 'heal' the opiate receptors by blocking them for a few hours after dosing. This blockade also results in an increase of endorphin release 4-6 hours after dosing. Easy enough to believe. However, I don't feel like it's helped me heal at all. In my situation, I think my body finally stabilized on that dose of LDN and the endorphin release from it. Basically, my body is now dependent on the endorphin release. In other words, once I stabilized at that dose, the endorphin release from the LDN just replaced the kratom and had stopped my WD/PAWS from progressing. Now trying to come off the naltrexone is throwing me into WDs as bad as I had when I started taking it.

I'm not sure how long this is going to last. Trying to decide whether to jump off the naltrexone completely, or continue to drop 0.1mg/week until I'm off it. I'm in WD even with the LDN tapering, but I can't tolerate it being much worse and still work. 

While LDN seemed like a miracle to me while I was dealing with PAWS, for me, all it did was put my WD on hold once I stabilized. Now I am basically finishing my WD from where I left off if that makes sense. If I had to do this all over again, personally, I wouldn't use LDN. Sooner or later, there's a price to pay, and naltrexone didn't fix that for me. It just delayed it. There's no free ride. 

I'm not saying naltrexone is bad and folks shouldn't use it. It was great for the cravings, and I have arthritis and other inflammatory crap coming back now too. I just think for me in my circumstance, using it post-CT like that and thinking I could just stop it after 6-7 months hasn't gone as I had planned. I could keep taking the LDN, but my whole point in stopping was to get out of the constant WD and not have to take something else. 

Sorry for the long ramble, I just wanted to put this out there because there's not a whole lot of LDN info out here in this sub. And I very rarely see someone who used it post back months later when they tried to stop using the LDN.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991225600242615}"

It’s been a minute since I’ve posted. I quit back in November and was doing pretty good, I didn’t have any serious WDs. I wasn’t super happy during that time period- which I expected, but I don’t think I realized how much I mentally relied on K. 

Somehow, over the past month it’s like my brain shut off all logic against this plant and I started taking small amounts casually. It started 1-3x a week, and now it’s more like 5-6x a week. I take a small amount (2G) and thankfully have avoided physical dependency, but that’s not my problem. I don’t know how to view this substance as “unacceptable”. I stopped all other substances years ago and I wouldn’t touch them with a 10 ft pole. But for some reason with K, my brain thinks I can have a casual relationship with it. Even though when I tried to keep it to once or twice a week, I failed. I don’t want to live my life thinking about K, when I could take it, etc. my biggest struggle has been thinking back over the time I took it daily, I just remember being happy. I sometimes wonder if life is just better on K.

Throughout the day, dose after dose, I start to feel bloated. I'm also very agitated, but I'm not sure if I can fully blame that on the kratom. I've gained some weight and I've stopped caring about pretty much everything. I feel bad for my husband because I used to take pretty good care of myself, but I just can't be bothered anymore. 

At the root of all this, I have terrible anxiety and depression. Jumping from one addiction to the next has just been my way of getting through life. I'm self medicating because I don't understand how people can actually get through each day being completely sober. I feel like I need SOMETHING to take the edge off. At the same time, I need to get off of this stuff. I can't imagine what it's doing to my insides if I wake up with as much pain as I do every morning. 

I'm on a very mild dose of Lexapro and I was curious if I should increase the dose while I decrease the kratom. I want to give myself the best chance at success with the least amount of discomfort. 

I own and operate a successful business and I have to manage people. I haven't bothered trying to get off this stuff because I have to be productive during the day.  

I just want to put a plan in place to set myself up for success.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979149699211121}"

Last time I was here, I was tired of the disgusting drink (about 5 years straight and it was time to stop. I used to take Percocet 30’s- a habit I enjoyed, but kept somewhat in control) Anyways, I made it 12 days CT off kratom and honestly WD wasn’t terrible at all for such a large dose, except for the RLS/sleep issues. However it didn’t last long; I happened to walk by a smoke shop in my new town and saw Kratom capsules through the window. I felt super bad about starting up again, but decided I could take capsules since I despised drinking the sludge. Now, I have another opportunity to quit because I’m having a minor surgical procedure this Friday. The anesthesiologist I spoke with yesterday asked if I smoked or drank and I told here occasionally both, which is accurate. She said after Monday, don’t smoke or drink. It then dawned on me that I probably shouldn’t be taking Kratom leading up to the surgery either; so I called her right back and explained what it was and why I took it. She had never heard of it, but quickly did some research, and said ya don’t take that either. So here I sit on the floor watching tv knowing I’ll be lucky to sleep at all tonight, as I’m like 30 hours in. My plan is to power through til the Friday surgery and hope it goes well. My concern is that I’m really going to want to be able to sleep Friday night post surgery… on the phone she was like, you can go back to taking it after surgery….

But, I see this as a great opportunity to not take it again. On Friday I’ll be 4 days in and I know I’ll be upset with myself if I go right back to it.

I’ve read about and bought some vitamin C mega dose, and I already exercise a lot. I’m not super concerned with the other WD symptoms outside of RLS/Sleep problems. Last quit I was still dealing with that shit on day 12, and I essentially gave up.

This is so hard.,"Basics: I'm 31f. I have 2 small children (3 years and 6 months old). I've been taking kratom since May 2019. 

I've always had a really addictive personality since I was young...but as I got older I was able to let go of mostly everything. The hardest, until now, was alcohol. I went to outpatient rehab for alcohol and have been sober since February 2018. I've experimented with almost all drugs at least once, besides H, extacy, and acid. Nothing was ever hard to stop until alcohol. I couldn't do it on my own. I got help and never had to withdrawl. Luckily I only relapsed once and immediately got myself back into outpatient rehab. Looking back, I am realizing now I never really had to withdrawl from anything. Until now. 

A few months after my first child was born, I was exhausted, and in so much pain from pregnancy induced EDS. I saw so many doctors abs was in physical therapy 3 days a week. Nothing was helping. I had a friend tell me that she had been using this ""supplement"" for a few years that really improved her energy, stamina, confidence, etc. When I asked her about it and after doing very little research, I decided to give it a try. It was legal, I thought....so it couldn't be that bad. I wish I could go back and see that this was really a case of ""misery loves company"". My friend, knowing me my entire life and knowing what I had gone grub with alcohol just a year before, was offering me a new escape. Yes, I know it wasn't her fault. I still made the decision to try. And I will tell you I regret it WITH EVERYTHING INSIDE OF ME. 

At first it started out innocent enough. 2-3 grams a couple times a week when I really needed to get stuff done. The only thing I could compare the feeling to was when I was having to take vicodin for kidney issues. Energy, pain relief, confidence. I should have known then. I should have recognized the demon. Maybe I did and I wasn't able to accept it. Maybe subconsciously I made excuses why this was different. I didn't do anything reckless, it was legal, it was just a plant, I was just going to use it on the hard days. Whatever it was, I convinced myself damn well that it was going to be okay. 
Well it's not. 
I started taking it daily and dosing 3x a day about 4-5 months into it. Eventually I was on 30 capsules (around 15 grams) a day. Never more, never less. It had become a normality for me. Avoiding every thought or feeling that told me this was getting out of hand. 
I never thought about quitting until I got pregnant with my second. I knew I needed to but I was making excuses. Tired from pregnancy, etc. Then in Jan 2020 I found myself in the hospital with appendicitis and had to get emergency surgery while I was 15 weeks pregnant. I thought, okay...I'm in the hospital for a few days without kratom. When I get out I'm just going to stay off. This will be the end. No excuses. When I got home, I lasted 4 whole days kratom free. At that point I gave up. That is when I realized that this was going to be a lot different than anything else I've ever had to quit. The thought terrified me.

Unfortunately I was not able to quit for my entire pregnancy. I can't even think about that without feeling like the biggest pos ever. I will live with that forever. My baby had no issues (at least that we know of yet) and she is 6 months. I even brought it to the hospital when I had her and dosed like normal when I was there. How stupid! 

Anyways, this brings me to now. My last dose was one week ago today. That day i was feeling really off, so some how I was able to get by on only one dose of 5g. That night I ended up in the ER, again, this time with gallstones. Another emergency surgery. 2 days in the hospital, 4 days total with pain meds, and now 7 days no kratom. I don't know why I thought now was a good time, but I knew I was ready. My only regret right now is not taking into account that sleep equals healing, and I currently have 0 sleep insomnia, so healing from surgery has been harder than expected. That and the withdrawals. THE FUCKING WITHDRAWALS. I have never experienced something like this. The emotions, the pain, the insomnia, RLS but all over my body, the irritability, the fatigue, the guilt. I'm doing this alone, recovering from surgery, home alone with my 2 children. How I am even awake, alive and *barley* functioning right now is a miracle from God.

I haven't had a lot of time to read through this sub reddit, but I'm so thankful to have found it. I'm quitting for real because I can never imagine having to go through this again. I never would have imagined this is where I'd be right now. 

If anyone has a timeline or knows how long until the really bad withdrawal symptoms stop… I would appreciate any advice. I’m literally doing this cold turkey and I have no idea what I’m doing. There  are moments in the day where I feel like I’m going to die, and then I get a little light for a minute or two where I feel normal.

My kratom addiction was for in between 6 and 7 years at anywhere from 30 to 60 gpd.  My phenibut addiction was 1 year at 2.5 gpd. My psychiatrist prescribed gabapentin and baclofen for my phenibut addiction and tried to get me on suboxone.  I never filled my suboxone prescription.  I am now on Day 8 of quitting kratom, and day 2 of completely quitting phenibut.  I would highly recommend trying to get a prescription to Gabapentin before suboxone.  Suboxone is not a tapering prescription.  They will try and get you on suboxone for life.  I have felt nearly 0 withdrawal symptoms with the help of gabapentin, when in previous attempts I was not able to take the withdrawals.  The only symptom I have felt is being tired all day, but even that has gone away.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987301230430603}"

Last  Week i took 8grams a day, i just want to give my body a few more days  to adjust on the first dose on the evening, and it works. Last frieday  was the first day i dont felt any wd‘s during the day. Saturday was the first day id stay at home without keeping me busy  the whole day, and  just chill, watch tv and have great sex 3 times a day, and it was fine  too.

On Sunday i went off to 6grams a day in two doses, the first around 18:30-20:00, the last before i go to bed around 22:00-22:30.

This week i will go around 5 if its work maybe 4 grams a day.

Some sidefacts:

1. My libido is very high
2. In  the morning i wake up and feel the wd‘s, after i stand up they will go  away and dont come back during the day, dont know why, strange….
3. Last week i start to do workouts, running, and sauna again, that feels great but hard to motivate.
4. I bought the WHM Book, currently reading, will start soon with cold showers and breathing.
5. During  the day i have some ups and downs, mostly felt normal, but this  euphoric feeling gone away after the second week of the taper.

Still 11 days to go, before kicking complete off.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.755034327507019}"

Take as much time off of work as you can, if you are able, taper, cold Turkey, medically assisted, whatever… just do it and stick to it. If that means you’ve got to attend meeting every day, do that. Do whatever. Fight for your life back. You deserve it. I love y’all. Start walking home. I believe in you.

2022-02-01 06:25:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/shsram/2_weeks_ct_feel_great/,2 weeks CT. Feel great!,"So the last post I did here was on day 3 CT. Back then I felt mild withdrawal and emotional ups and downs but was largely OK. I started feeling more present and alert, normal once again even then. Now? It’s even better.

Quick backstory: I was a 6 year, 6 dose per day, 80+ GPD kratom user. I used capsules mainly, after every meal I would dose. I took Kratom for twice as long as the drugs I used Kratom to get off of. I did a LONG taper (18 months from 80GPD on down)

I’ve hit the two week mark, which I find to be incredible. What’s even more incredible, however, is how easily divorced from Kratom I became. For the last six months (or so) of my Kratom use, I took 2 750MG capsules after every meal. That was between 7.5-9GPD. Such a minuscule daily dosage compared to what I formerly took, and I felt like during that time I made some progress as far as the slow emotional (and physical) adjustment regarding coming off of Kratom. So maybe my “reawakening” post-sobriety wasn’t as stark due to that. I’ve experienced not a great deal of ups-and-downs or low points yet, I feel very normal and natural and have largely been able to go with the flow of things without a hitch. 

For those teetering on the edge of jumping off: DO IT! Don’t let the concerns or worries scare you off of making the jump. It is so very worth not having to constantly be concerned with dosing, to worry about being able to afford the stuff, to feel like life on the other side of kratom won’t ever feel good again (my largest concern before quitting). The freedom will allow you all the fruits life has to offer that kratom keeps out of your reach. I have taken on a new job in a new state since quitting, something I’d have never considered possible before I jumped off. You can do this!",11,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9325023889541626}"

See is fantastic and my husband loves it too.

The other one is a dark comedy, but so entertaining.

For the past month I have noticed a strange burning pain on the RIGHT side of my chest. I went and had some tests done (EKG, chest x-ray, blood panel) but everything came back fine. Doctor assumed the pain is caused by costochondritis (inflammation of cartilage that connects from the rib to the breast bone). I was also having shortness of breath but assumed it was anxiety due to the chest pain. Well, three-ish weeks later and I’m still having chest pains but have noticed the shortness of breath has gotten a lot worse. I don’t even know if you would call it that but there are multiple times throughout the day where I feel like I can never get a satisfying breath in (if that makes sense?) and my chest feels tight. It’s almost as if you tried to breathe through a straw. I had a covid test done to see if that was the cause but it came back negative. Im 25F, 145lbs, diagnosed with GERD since I was a kid, and I have been taking 2 teaspoons of kratom dissolved in hot water about 4 times a day.

My girlfriend found my stash of empty extract bottles and was reasonably upset but supportive of helping me quit. I feel bad because I have had past issues with alcohol and haven't had a drink in years but have been using kratom for almost as long as a sort of replacement without telling anybody. I have also blown my savings and damaged the trust of my awesome partner and I'm done letting myself and her down and not being the best me I can be.

I will be using cannabis for the withdrawals but after the week mark plan on being completely sober for the first time in a long time and hope to use this subreddit to keep me accountable and for support. I'm sick of being numb, dumb and constipated and spending literally thousands of dollars on a fucking opioid that has only hurt me and the people who are close to me.

2022-02-01 00:27:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/shn4h8/perspective_after_1_month_clean/,Perspective after 1 month clean,"   I finally made it a month for the first time since I started using Kratom about 4 years ago. Looking back, it's amazing how many compounding problems I created for myself by trying to cheat my way though life. For example, I took Kratom to relieve stress at work > Kratom fucked with my sleep cycle and I started grinding my teeth at night > Take more Kratom to ignore the problem, as my gum line slowly recedes. Gum line is clearly damaged, but fear about not being able to afford the dentist makes me self medicate and ignore the problem as it gets worse. I take more Kratom in higher doses, which not only exacerbates the grinding but also makes me a nervous wreck, who constantly freaks out about the worsening problem but also is incapable of acting on it. Eventually I had to deal with it and have gum surgery which costed thousands of dollars, because I was afraid of confronting reality and dealing with my struggles when they arose. Ignoring a festering wound won't make it go away. 

This is just one example of a way I procrastinated dealing with a problem, while using Kratom as a blanket which shrouds the harsh truths in life. It's hard to not feel foolish when you look back on problems that are easily solvable, and quitting Kratom gave me some perspective 

As many people have already said, there's no magical safe drug you can take that'll let you be happy and high all day every day. Kratom feels like a cheat code at first, it's easy to trick yourself by saying ""it's legal so it must be ok"". First few months you feel invigorated, waking up in the morning is easy when you know you're gonna get high right away. But just with any other drug, the longer you take it the more diminishing the returns will be. Taking Kratom is not much better than popping Vicodin all day, there's only so much dopamine to go around. When the honeymoon phase ends and the dopamine stops hitting, you're left with a nasty little addiction which provides no joy in life.",33,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9934957027435303}"

And yes, 15gpd was certainly enough to destroy my libido, ability to focus at work, feel pleasure from traveling or sports, and any kind of motivation to do anything productive with my life.

I'm still not 100%, or even 80%, but every week I have been seeing small improvements that give me hope the end of this brain fog/ lethargy/ PAWS nightmare is in sight.

I had a rapid taper before jumping, down to about just 3gpd so my acutes weren't bad at all. But that's never been the issue for me. 

I had about 5 failed quits all due to PAWS. I'd make it past the acutes, then the depression, lack of drive, etc would wear me down over the next 2-3 weeks before I'd dose again.

This time is different. Firstly, I know what to expect largely in part to reading this forum every day.

Secondly, I have no illusion kratom gives me benefit anymore. The final 6 months of my habit, I dosed 3-6 times per day, but I had the energy of someone in the middle of acute WD. It simply wasn't doing anything for me.

Somewhere along the line kratom flipped on me, it went from a miracle cure for anxiety/ fatigue/ bad mood, to a brain destroyer. I could work long hours building my business and still have energy to go be social in the evening, wake up and do it again.

All I know is one day it just stopped working, and the side effects started getting worse, quickly.

I had terrible brain fog, and since I had conditioned myself to work 10 hrs+ per day, I would try and miserably fail to get anything productive done.

I'd just stay at home, then the second my woman would leave the house I'd start playing video games and wouldn't stop until maybe 7pm where I'd get too stressed about not getting anything done, then answer enough messages to feel like I accomplished something.

It left me feeling guilty, useless, and only made me more stressed the more I avoided working.

It took me another 6 months of daily use to figure out I was chasing the dragon, just avoiding WDs. My excuse was that I couldn't quit now because my business needed me, and I had to wait until it was less reliant on me.

Which is hilarious in hindsight because I was literally playing video games all day and my employees were forced to pick up the pieces from all the problems that caused.

Fast forward to now, 4 weeks in, and my brain fog is still definitely there so I am having troubles working, but each week it's getting better. 

It comes in waves throughout the day. I can work well for 2 hours, then 2 hrs I'm a vegetable, then in the evening again I'll sometimes get a second wind.

It's a very odd sensation, as it feels similar to going between undosed and dosed, but I'm not dosing, it happens randomly.

Yesterday felt like a breakthrough day for me, as I finally felt the energy to get through a full-on heavy lifting workout like I used to. I've been getting exercise, but not at the same intensity as before. Yesterday I did a full barbell workout with overhead press, power cleans, etc until my muscles were torched.

Followed my sauna and ice bath. I felt so much better after it was silly. I felt normal again for a few hours. My theory is that since my testosterone levels have been so blasted by K, the T boost I get from heavy lifting is more noticeable.

I think I still have another month before I can truly feel I am getting back to normal, but these small improvements are motivating to me. 

Especially since in my last failed quits I would relapse before feeling these small improvements come, so it's proof to me I will eventually get my brain back to normal.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979471564292908}"
