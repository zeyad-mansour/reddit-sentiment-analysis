1) For my kids and wife.  They deserve a better me.

2) For my spirituality.  I can't progress with this addiction blocking my path.

3) For my health.  Kratom has caused me a slew of health issue.  I won't list them all but I'm sure you guys know what i'm talking about.

4) For my life - I can't continue planning my life around my daily doses.  It's insane!

5) For my wallet.  It's so fuck'n expensive!

I'm starting Day 1 again tomorrow.  Wish me luck, and I wish any of you the best who will start or have started this long journey.",57,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.68704826}"

I will be doing a fast tapper after 3 years of use. Only going to use Kratom when withdrawals get bad and will only use enough to stop it a bit. I want to have some pain from this end to remember it fully.

Things that worry me.

Kratom helped with time - now time will be consumed without a drug. I do play piano, but for the last 5 months my addiction got bad and I mean bad, so I lost interest in the things I loved to do! Extracts with powders daily. For the last month I was dropping Kratom non-stop almost every 2 hours and it was ripping my mind and body apart.

Went into the gym dragging my feet due to poor diet thanks to Kratom and constipation so I had to eat less to over come this problem. Eating less and trying to grow strong and build mass is not feasible.

I would be up until 2-3am or until Kratom made me tired. Today I was in the gym pissed off with myself and when I looked into mirror I felt depressed with anger towards myself.

I have so much potential to make good music and to become stronger than I am now. I am sure ending this people will think in the coming months not only do I look better, but my size and power will rock up and up.

So here I am writing this in telling the world I am ready to end this horrible addiction that controlled my smile and life for far too long.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67546964}"

Feeling really optimistic about this quit, my will is way stronger than it was last year when I quit and relapsed. Sleep has been rough, I'll stay up for 26-28 hours (involuntarily) and then get maybe 3-4 hours of really choppy sleep. Gabapentin helps with the RLS and cravings, but absolutely nothing will get me to sleep, even ambien comes and goes in 15 minutes and im just left awake in bed. 

While I still think the lack of sleep is the worst part, the boredom is really, really starting to fuck with me. Yesterday I spent 4 hours at the courts getting shots up, and drove around a bit, before spending the entire night (10 pm - 11 am) just in my bed, watching youtube and reddit, constantly checking my phone every 15 minutes to see how much time has passed. The clockwatching is the most maddening part of all of this. 

Today I barely have the energy to go upstairs and pick up my egg drop soup, let alone get up another 4 hours at the courts. seriously the uber eats guy dropped off my egg drop soup like 4 hours ago and its still outside my door.

The things I used to enjoy and that occupied my time, like video games, reading, talking to friends, cooking, etc have all lost their joy. It all feels like work. all my interests are now my enemies. its weighing on my soul.

its just about dinner time now, I think I've gone to the toilet 8 times since I woke, and I still havent eating anything. Im trying to plan out what exactly im going to do all night tonight. Maybe go for a long ass walk. I dont know. Anyone have suggestions on new ways to burn time?

Maybe I was getting sick, but I also realized I was starting to get depressed as well- like a sort of cold grayness I guess? On Monday we celebrated my daughter's birthday in which I did my absolute best to not engage with anybody. I KNEW what was happening. The kratom lost it's usefulness in my body- it's happened the other three times I've quit. I took kratom in the morning on Tuesday, and that was it. So by Thursday I was beginning to feel the chills.

 I work as a teacher. Everyday we have to fill out a COVID certification form saying I didn't have the symptoms listed and I had a temp lower than 100.4. So, I was truthful. I marked that I had chills and fatigue, but my temp was normal. I got called into the principals office later that day. I wasn't yelled at, but was told I should have just called in sick. I told him I thought the fever was the main concern and overall I'm OK. Regardless, that didn't matter. So I had some paperwork laid out before me giving me options under the CARES Act on what I wanted to do. Well, I wanted full pay, so I asked for exact clarification- ""If I go and get tested right now, I'll be covered?"" ""Yes"". Ok then... I left the building.

Luckily there was a clinic on the town square that gave tests. OH MY GOD. That swab practically goes from the nose to the tear duct (I don't think it's the tear duct, but it felt like it was behind my eye). Man, my eyes watered for about 15 minutes after. So, I was told the sample will be sent to a state run lab and results will be made available at the earliest on this coming Monday (remember this happened Thursday). I can't come back to work until 72 hours after I receive a negative result, or September 7th, whichever is earliest. So September 2nd at the earliest.

Look, I don't know if I was getting sick actually or I was going into a natural depression cycle, or it was the kratom pooping out. I jumped off CT just to cover my bases, and THANKFULLY I have this time to go through this sickness/withdrawal/whatever was happening to me. I mean, I feel sick, not like the other times I quit, which was just slight chills. I was being honest on that certification form- I had chills, fatigue, no fever; however, If I just would have called in I wouldn't have received these days off.

Today is day 5 CT for me. I have used opiates since age 15-29. Been using Kratom for the last two years as a replacement for my pill use. I was using about 40gpd and tapered it out to 25gpd about 3 weeks back. I couldn't taper any further so I took the jump to CT. Spent the first few days in bed. Using 1600mg gabapin and THC/CBD. I will taper out the gabapin (have done that before). 

I am feeling quite odd. I am back home with my family and trying to work from home. Mentally I feel dead for some reason. Work is intellectually demanding and VERY hard right now. I had 400mg of caffein today and even that did not seem to help much. I cannot get through the day without some CBD/THC (enough to get a mild buzz). Life feels devoid of meaning right now. I just look forward to getting into bed at night and wathtching netflix till I pass out. Sleep has  been decent thankfully. Pretty sure the magnesium, gabapin and clonidine have helped there. My nose is still runny and I feel like I have light fever for some reason. I know Kratom does that. Just waiting for this shit to be over.

I plan to be completely sober by the end of this month. I want to be clean when I turn 30. I would have spent exactly half my life high on opiates.

I know it sucks right now but I am trying to keep my end goal in sight. I am letting it suck right now so that I can get to a better future sooner. I don't crave the Kratom anymore as such except for the mental fog. I hope that passes soon enough.

For the first couple years, I kept it under 10 gpd, usually 3-8 depending on what I was looking for. During those breaks, I don't remember experiencing withdrawals, or anything that made me question the K. Eventually, I started upping the dosage, usually from boredom, and got to 10-15 gpd, and still don't remember having nasty withdrawals when stopping abruptly. In fact, I remember laughing at the idea of Kratom withdrawals, because I could start and stop on a whim.

Now, when I got to 20-30 gpd, I definitely noticed withdrawals when quitting abruptly, but I still laughed at them. Compared to the image of ""withdrawal"" I had in my mind, these were a joke. They were still unpleasant, so I did end up tapering off, but not on any regimen, and I just stopped when I got bored. The most severe withdrawals I experienced at the time were RLS and insomnia, both things I have extensive experience with (and not as the result of drugs), and I had other things to help take the edge off.

So you will imagine my fucking surprise when, after roughly 5 months of only taking 3-8 gpd, I'm experiencing the worst K withdrawals of my life. I'd been taking for probably 10 months straight, and got up to 20 gpd before cutting down to 3-8 gpd roughly 5 months ago. As I was getting close to the end of my stash, I decided not to reorder any because I was bored of it and didn't feel like spending the money. Granted, I was at the point where I was dosing more than once a day, even when I was only taking 6-8 gpd. Wasn't unusual for me to wake up with 2g and then take 3-4g at night.

I think it's been 7 days and I'm ready to die. I even made myself taper *further* before I ran out, taking only 2-4 gpd. I knew it probably wouldn't be pleasant, but I thought I'd just feel funky for a few days, and I figured I could compensate with something else. Just so happens that I decided I was going to quit smoking pot at the same time (unrelated). And, as luck would have it, Kava makes the experience much worse. I actually got pissed off one night and threw away all my Kava, too, thinking I had just lost my taste for it.

First 4 days, I thought I had the flu. I felt sick all the time, I was alternating between chills and hot flashes, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I didn't eat at all for the first 3 days, and I didn't even feel hungry by day 4. I was lucky to get 1-2 hours of sleep the first few days, and obviously felt dead 100% of the time.

As the intensity of the physical symptoms began to reduce, the mental ones increased. And at this point, they're still going strong. For a few days, I was on the verge of tears constantly, and constantly felt on the brink of a panic attack. That's dialed back, but I'm still getting strong anxiety and tremors. The overwhelming sorrow turned into depression, and now has turned into a numb deadness. I don't want to be awake, but I can't sleep. Nothing interests me. I just sit and wait for the day to be over so I can start the same shit again tomorrow. I was extremely irritable in the beginning, but have kinda gotten a hold on that.

But the insomnia changed, too. I'm getting maybe 5 hours of sleep at night now, but it doesn't feel like it. Normally I have very vivid dreams, and great dream recall, but I'm having cloudy, bland dreams with absolutely no recall past the first 10 seconds I'm awake. At best, I wake up feeling like I didn't sleep at all, and I'm mentally foggy all day, to the point that I can't function in any capacity.

So I've spent the last week wondering what the hell is wrong with me, and it finally dawned on me tonight. I'm withdrawing. And somehow withdrawing harder than before.

The irony? It's actually a relief. This shit sucks, but now I know why I feel so awful. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to navigate this. There's absolutely zero chance I'm going to relapse, but all I want is sleep. I just want to feel tired, lay down, and fall asleep. I want to sleep all night, without waking up drenched in sweat, or feeling like I'm in an ice box. I want to sleep soundly, and wake up tomorrow feeling like myself again.

I'm about to start crying. Dammit. I'm more sober than I've been in a long long time, but I constantly feel messed up. Like a nastier version of a hangover. All day. All night.

Protip for people with RLS: when it starts flaring up, wiggle/shake your foot as hard as you can until the muscles are so fatigued that you can't keep going. Dunno if it works for anyone else, but it clears it right up for me. Does nothing for the insomnia, but it does make those restless 8 hours slightly better.

2020-08-29 13:18:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/iiw87s/updated_addiction_book_list_recommendation_s/,Updated Addiction Book List Recommendation s,"Hello everyone, about 6 months ago I posted on here a handful of books on addiction that have helped me greatly on understanding the why, how, and what I can do and expect from having an addiction. I have 3 more books to add  the the list so I figured I would repost the updated version. Hope this helps you as much as it helped me!

Before I get to the list I do want to mention this Subreddit (quitting kratom) is an amazing source and info. But if you are still struggling OR want to go deeper on understanding your brain and how it works with addiction. Then I would reccomend these books. One last thing this is in no particular order. I felt each book moved me forward significantly on this journey and while some stuff might seem repetitive. I would say you don't know the subject until you know you CAN teach the subject. Or in my case...I ain't sober yet so there is still work to be done!

1. The Craving Mind by Dr. Judson Brewer - this book dives into all addictions, from sugar, to smartphones, to drugs, to even thinking.
2. Recovery : Freedom from our addictions by Russell Brand. - this books is a twist on the 12 steps that might work better for you then the original 12 steps.
3. Unchain your Brain by Dr Daniel Amen - I'm currently 3/4 through this one. It's similar to the craving mind and goes deep scientifically PLUS gives really practical advice you can apply instantly. (Really enjoying this one)
4. 12 Stupid Things that mess up our Recovery by Allen Berger PhD - a shorter, easy and to the point book. Its 12 of the most likely reasons for relapse.
5. 12 Smart things to do when the Booze and Drugs are gone by Allen Berger PhD - just like the other one, by dives into emotional Sobriety which has been HUGE for me. (This book for me showed me a blind spot I wasn't aware of that I had. EMOTIONAL SOBRIETY)
6. The predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely - this one has a few chapters on addiction and touches on it through our the book. I thought it does make the list because of that AND because it helped shed light on the ""I know what I should do but I keep doing what I shouldnt""
7. Breaking the Habit of being yourself by Dr Joe Dispenza - this one has a chapter on addiction and touches on it. I wanted to put it on the list because ""Your currently reality is based on your currently personality. And your personality is based on how you think, act, and feel. So if you can change your personality you can change your reality"" ---this book goes DEEP on that with practice tips you can apply today.
8. Refuge Recovery -  This is another complete alternative to AA. If you are into or want to get into meditating, mindfulness, or buddhism. Then this one is for you. Refuge Recovery was originally created by a guy trying to get sober but struggled with the AA of doing things, so created Refuge Recovery. The book has a format a lot like the AA book, but I really enjoyed it because I'm all about meditating, and mindfullness. (even though i suck and meditating right now) Also the 25% of the book is minfullness, and meditating exercises. Which I thought was really cool, I know a handful of meditations already using the Waking Up app and listening to Ram Dass and Joe Dispenza. But I still learned a few new ones here.
9. In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts - I'm only about half way through this one right now. It is an incredibly read. Dr. Gabor Mate (the author) does an amazing job and talking about addiction and trauma and how they intertwine. One thing that stood out for me is how he talks about we all suffer from trauma, even if you consider yourself to have  a ""perfect childhood"". Check out his Ted Talks and youtube videos if your curious and if you vibe with him like I did then get this book!
10. My Kratom Hell -  I actually have not read this book. This book was recommended to  me by someone from this community last time I posted this list, and they really liked it so I figured I would add it to the list! Here is a description of this book that I took off amazon. (book is only 8$ btw. or 6$ for kindle) One last thing it looks like the reviews have been over run bye people from the pro-kratom community. so I wouldnt take them to seriously with this particular book lol. ----DESCRIPTION :The book covers how Kratom romances a user, reasons for using it and how to go about quitting this opioid plant drug. The author covers sensitive topics such as Kratom hair loss, digestive issues, thyroid impact, complete Kratom informative and useful quitting tips and advice. The most important take-away is that My Kratom Hell is written by one a user for other users, first hand.

and this is my Updated book list! Again I hope it helps, and much strength and joy to everyone struggling from addiction!",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6197849}"

**Motivation** to quit: Point blank, I woke up every morning for the last few months of my addiction, wishing I hadn't. I couldn't admit it at first, but I wanted to kill myself. I was a zombie. Just sat in front of the TV for hours upon hours. (Fun fact: My TV's screen went blank Monday morning. I haven't even tried to get a replacement yet. I'm enjoying the silence. Besides, for now, I have most of what I need on my phone. I'd ""die"" without my TV a couple months ago. No more.) I hated being around other people. They didn't exist to me... including my wife, sadly. Today, it's a total 180 in that department.

**Determination** to stay quit: I'll be honest, although I knew from the beginning that I wanted to quit, I never imagined until a few weeks into quitting, that I would want to STAY QUIT FOREVER. I don't ever want to use Kratom again. Period. No ifs, ands, buts or other excuses. I'm willing to do WHATEVER IT TAKES to STAY QUIT on any given day! Example: If I have a sleepless night (like between days 68 and 69), then so be it. I guess I needed to not sleep that night to stay Kratom FREE. **WHATEVER IT TAKES!**

**Vigilance** to stay free from Kratom forever:
I talk about it all the time on here because it works for me. And I've noticed more and more people referring to it, putting it into their own words of course. This is where the mental aspect of addiction recovery really comes into play for me: I **NO LONGER BELIEVE THE LIES THAT MY ADDICT BRAIN TELLS ME**. ""Oh, you haven't used in such-in-such amount of time? Surely you can use now if you just *control* it."" Bullsh1t! If you feel you have to control something, isn't it already out of control? (That's addiction.) ""I've quit for a week and I still can't sleep. I will use tonight... just once (famous last words) so I can get one good night sleep."" Bullsh1t! *If* it even works (IF), what's stopping you from thinking the same thing the next night? The night after? Then all of a sudden you need it for ""energy"" during the day. You'll ""need"" it for this or that. The entire cycle is already spinning out of control AGAIN. **Once an addict, ALWAYS an addict.** ""Well, sure, I'm quitting now. And I'm serious. I *really* want to quit, BUT (another famous last word), but if I ever have something major go on in my life, I think I can use it then just to get through whatever the issue is."" Bullsh1t! If I don't get rid of that kind of thinking quickly, and I store that excuse in my back pocket, then I'm already setting myself up for relapse. Reservations, of ANY kind, can and will lead to relapse. This is why I always say (mostly to remind myself) to **STAY VIGILANT**. DON'T BELIEVE THE LIES YOUR ADDICT BRAIN TELLS YOU. Take the lie, and turn it around. Find the TRUTH. Let's look at our history. The truth is there.

Lastly, I want to mention **PATIENCE**. Have patience with yourself (but at the same time, don't give yourself excuses). Have patience with your mind and body. They are healing. No, it doesn't always feel good. But they are doing their job. I have to let them do their job... no matter how rotten it may feel. If you can't sleep... Patience. I didn't get more than 2-3 hours sleep for the first month. Then between 40-50 days I experienced the same thing (PAWS). Two nights ago, zero sleep. I haven't died. I'm functioning. I'm thriving like never before. I'm more active than I've been in years. Patience. 

Having a difficult time quitting or staying quit? Patience. And Motivation. And Determination. And Vigilance. This is what's working for me. Find what works for you. Everyone is different. But when it comes to the fact that WE CAN QUIT KRATOM, NO MATTER WHAT, we are the same. There are no ""special cases"".

Another one who is trying to taper off this stuff m I was taking 4 grams up to five times a day. In the last week, I've tapered down to 2 grams three to four times a day. Hopefully it's not too fast a taper, but also hopefully it's fast enough as well, if that makes sense. I'm quitting this shit as I've realized I'm an addict. Younger I played around with different drugs in my twenties, then it was alcohol, broke my back and had a few motorcycle accidents, which led to pain pill abuse. Stopped using pain pills cold turkey, was good for a year and half. Then found Kratom. Seemed like a Godsend. How wonderful this natural plant was, I thought. I thought, hey, I can't get addicted, it's natural, and it's ""different than pain pills"" or other bad things. I have been deceived by this plant. It's ruined my marriage, as I didn't see it being a problem, couldn't accept that it WAS indeed as bad as pain pills in that it shut down all my feelings, all my worries. It made everything disappear. But it also made ME disappear. I didn't see that I was neglecting my wife. My other addictions prior did the same thing. I don't have issues with anything other than the kratom currently, but it's all about the ""addiction"" which for YEARS I have ignored and let fester, never accepting that addiction was even the problem. This plant was so deceiving. Hopefully I can taper down in the next week and just jump off, maybe in the next two days go down to 1 gram three to four times a day, then .5 grams three to four times a day, and couple days after that, space the .5 grams out father and farther until I just stop.

So I've posted here on and off previously during my attempted quits. I did pretty good before Covid, quit for a solid month and even saw the ""other side"" (aka no more physical effects,  just mental effects like anxiety/lack of motivation etc). Of course, my addicted brain convinced me I could control myself. I can't. So, here I am on day 1 again. I'm actually kind of excited.

However, I'm also nervous. I have suddenly been hit with an intense wave of what I can only describe as fear. I haven't been doing great recently in that I'm about to lose my grandfather to cancer, the state of the world, the constant hate...but it's weird, because it simultaneously activated this intense fear of me having possibly done irreversible damage to myself.

Currently, I take Adderall. I've been on it for a few years, and have been mixing OPMS Kratom extract shots with adderall since I started Kratom. The highest dose level I ever got to was 3 OPMS shots a day, but that was only for a month. Overall, I think I used powdered Kratom fora  year, then OPMS extract shots exlusively for maybe another year, maybe a bit less.

If I look out for myself (diet, proper sleep, etc), do you think I will make it out of this without permanent damage? The reason this fear was sparked, aside from the reasons outlined above, is that I have this terrible headache today and I threw up this morning mysteriously. It was like, I didn't have a stomach ache, but I still had to vomit? Now I'm reading all these studies on people who mixed adderall with Kratom and their brain swelled and shit. FUCK

I know everyone is different. Please share any information you know, maybe convince me that I'm a little paranoid...anything. I appreciate it. These studies are scaring me so fucking bad I'm not even sure withdrawals will bring me back to this shit

btw, adderall will be out the door soon. But I MUST conquer kratom first, and I have a healthier relationship with adderall (and it also assists in the quit process)

EDIT: I should add that the main symptom i've developed that I think I can narrow down to Kratom use is my frequent urinations. I swear to god, its like I have to piss WHILE I'm drinking, that's how quick this shit runs through me. ",7,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.66123295}"

I went from oxy to heroin to suboxone to Kratom, which is where I am now. It’s been 10+ years on some form of opiate daily. I had a weekend binder of h and suffer pretty bad withdrawals for about 5 days. I was barely getting any relief from Kratom. Anyways after about 7 days I felt fine and was dosing Kratom 5x 4g per day. I started a taper immediately, but I only wanted two doses per day. I skipped my two middle doses (8g total) and went into withdrawal in between doses for about 5 days. Which is where I was a few days ago. So I guess my point is, if you let yourself withdrawal a little bit at a time, it does get easier. I’m no longer in withdrawal when I wake up and only take 2g in the morning. I am no longer in withdrawal when I’m waiting for my 2g night dose.  Sometimes I feel like I don’t even need the night dose but scared I’ll lose sleep. I’m going to continue to reduce by .5 every few days until I’m done with this stuff.

TLDR:  pain does make it easier to reduce in future. If your in withdrawal, you probably don’t need your full dose to get enough relief to get by, making it easier to to take less and less. Gotta commit.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48876548}"

I have been actively trying to maintain and/or quit my kratom addiction since last November—failing miserably on my own. Over the last week I’ve come to the realization that the reason I’ve failed so many countless times is because I’ve been trying it *on my own.* The obsession of mind that comes from addiction cannot be taken on from within your own head, and that’s a fact. You need outside resources.

If this form, friends/family, etc has been enough for you to quit, that’s fantastic. I, however, was not successful using these strategies.

Finally on Saturday I threw my hands up, gave up, and went to an AA meeting. I’ve been completely sober since. And even though I’m still at less than a week, the time is completely irrelevant to me now because I *know* I am finally free and I will never go back. 

Turning myself to a community of others who have dealt with the same issues (who are all now absolutely thriving)—as well as reconnecting with  my spirituality—have been more than enough to not even crave kratom over the last week. I’m excited to see where it all goes.

But I’m telling you, if you’ve tried everything and nothing works, it’s time to do things differently. Try the meeting, because when you look around and hear people’s stories, then see where they are now, you too will believe that it works.

Everyone has their own strategies and I’m not saying everyone needs this. However, if you’re reading this and you’ve been trying to quit for months and months and you have failed consistently, I really think you should
Try this.

Long story short, I've always been the happiest and most positive person you'd ever come across, nothing would ever get me down. My wife suffered with depression and i just couldn't get my head around how people couldn't just shift out of it and stay positive. But now i've had my first ever experience of depression and hopelessness (although mild, still worrying me), and I feel it's a from my withdrawal from a year of codeine and ibuprofen tablet addiction which I quit a month ago by shoving 20g a day of kratom into my system. 

For the first 3 weeks the kratom would make everything manageable and I was feeling ok but now I just feel lethargic, un motivated, lazy, useless and unhappy. It has to be the kratom. I have what many would deem a good life, 3 kids, happy marriage, I work for myself from home and earn good money, yet I feel hopeless. I don't want to go to the gym and work is a chore I have to literally force myself to do.  

Do you think this is withdrawal from codeine, kratom use, or both? Whatever it is I plan on going CT from kratom and all drugs next week and I want to reset my head!

And maybe someone has a similar story and can relate.

I started taking kratom after hearing about it on an mma podcast last May or June. I am, when not in COVID quarantine, an avid Brazilian Jiu Jitsu practioner, and dabbler in Muay Thai and western boxing. I did some googling and sure enough tons of reviews claiming how it was a wonder supplement. Some BJJ sites talked about how other people in martial arts used it to help with pain, fatigue, focus etc. Of course, I purposely ignored the links with negative things like the word ""addiction"" in them (if only, right?). I assumed it was probably just some soccer mom who had never tried it but their addict kid had trace amounts in his/her system when they OD on some other drug. I got my first bottle of capsules via the mail and took my first dose of kratom. It was 3 grams. Later I learned that was a fairly high dose for a first time and the wellbutrin I was taking was likely interfering with kratom's effects. At first kratom worked great and did exactly what was promised. I switched from pills to making a tea and drank it in the afternoon after working out. Overtime the amount per dose started to climb, but I shrugged it off. I started feeling a little jittery and getting slight brain fog the hour or so before I would drink my tea. I also, began noticing around evening I was starting to feel a little anxiety and depression. Nothing major, just kind of background noise. I shrugged all that off too, not making a connection.

Since I mentioned wellbutrin: I was diagnosed with chronic depression about 10 years ago and have been taking 300 mg wellbutrin -after trying a few other anti-depressents- for the last 5. I also have a diagnosis of adult ADHD. The wellbutrin did its job for the depression and helped a little with the impulsivity. In general other than the aches and pains associated with combat sports, life was pretty good. Another reason why I am kicking myself for ever trying this shit in the first place.

Due to a number of reasons, I quit kratom CT the first week of Jan. this year. At the time I was at about 15 gpd made into tea with an ocassional extra 15 g dose when I felt I needed it, which was becoming more frequent. When I quit kratom I also quit a 2x day Monster Zero energy drink habit, and moved into a new house. All on the same day. The following night was hell and it didn't get better the next day either. I thought I had the flu at first, combined with withdraws from caffiene and probably from some of the ingredients they dump into energy drinks. I'm an Iraq vet, I was there in 2003, I got food poisoning the second week in country. I had to pull guard duty with a fever, in my own shit and vomit, during multiple fire fights over the course of almost a week. I was sleep deprived, exhausted and miserable. The first 4 days off kratom were worse than that experience. After day 2 of WD I finally had the Aha! moment and found sites discussing kratom WD. I realized I had become addicted to the drug. I pushed through, dealt with PAWS for about 2 months. The PAWS gradually got better and then pretty much ceased. I found this site, read stories, and they helped. My wife and kids never thought I had anything other than the flu, however, as I kept my use, WD, and PAWS to myself. In all honesty, I felt a great deal of shame of having a drug problem. I didn't want anyone to know, or to admit it myself even.

So, 3 months clean and along comes COVID. Like so many others I decided: ""Hey, I'm an adult, and I can use kratom responsibly."" I told myself I'd just use it sparingly during the lockdown to help me cope."" 5 months later I was at 15-30 gpd again, in capsule form this time, once or twice a day. A week and half ago I woke up at 3 o'clock in the morning sat up in bed and said to myself, ""You have a drug abuse problem, and you are an addict."" I woke my wife up and confessed everything, despite my deep sense of shame and worry about ruining my relationship with her and the kids. Fortunately she was very understanding and appreciated that I came to her with my problem. The next day my wife and I told my kids about what I was struggling with and I made an appointment with my psychiatrist who I also told everything. I started to taper. With my wife's help I dropped 0.5-1 gpd till now. I am down to 8 gpd. I take it at 2 pm on the dot, everyday. This morning I flushed everything else in the house except 8 grams. I just took that 8 grams at 2 pm this afternoon. That will be the last time in my life I will ever touch the stuff again. I wanted to take this last dose right before posting (before it kicks in), so when tomorrow comes around and its been 24 hours I already put it out there. Too bad if it's tough.

I don't prescribe to positive thinking, I think you can believe all you want and fail. But I do think if you don't have a plan, and don't start off thinking you can succeed you definitely won't. So here goes: This time I'm going to use this site. I'm am being and will continue to be  honest with myself, my family, and my psychiatrist. My psychiatrist is going to check in with me every week and has prescribed kapvay to help with withdraws and impulsivity. I am not doing it alone. I have a few BJJ buddies I can roll with (a COVID bubble if you will). I have my kettlebell work outs - Simple and Sinister 4 life! I have a heavy bag I can punch and kick. I have my nutrition dialed in. I don't have an energy drink habit this time around. This time I have a plan and I am executing that plan. I may fail. If I do, I will get back up and try again and then again, and then again. If it takes till I'm dead so be it. I am and always will be a drug addict, but that doesn't mean I have to be a drug user ever again. Kratom, and the part of me that is an addict, can both suck it.

I'll be back at 2:00 pm tomorrow to check in.",1,"{'covid': 3, 'quarantine': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48563263}"

I'm 24 years old, female, and been addicted to kratom for almost 3 years now, on and off. It started with just powder, around 5-15 gpd and then of course grew bigger over the next couple years to around 20-30 gpd as I felt my apathy/anger for everything in my life escalate to huge proportions. I had no desire to do anything besides sit around, sleep, and watch movies. It was such utter misery. I hated myself, I looked like a zombie, I had no life fulfillment, was so fucking lonely, I felt so void of hope, that this how things now were and would always be.

Over the next year or so I realized that I had absolutely no choice but to quit kratom to live any semblence of a decent life, and I tried probably over 20 times, usually getting a couple days to 5 days then falling back into its evil clutches. I was a total fucking slave to this horrible plant. This would start a vicious self-destructive cycle. Fail & relapse, then go hard for awhile with extracts, skyrocketing my tolerance and making me more of a slave, then half-heartedly quit for a few days and repeat cycle over and over. I was spending all of my income on this painful cycle, for these brief periods of artificial euphoria (always soon followed by shame and dysphoria). I was so fucking sad. And then while in this painful cycle of quitting & relapsing I fell in love with a girl, she was everything I ever wanted, beautiful, smart, talented, fun, goofy, and caring... and I lied to her dozens of times, maybe a hundred times to cover this addiction. I told her that I had quit a long-term kratom addiction a few months ago and wouldn't go back to it. I would relapse regularly but only tell her about maybe 1/10 of those relapses. It was so much worse than she ever imagined. I was so so so dependent on this plant through this relationship, which infuriated me. It infuriated me I couldn't be honest with the love of my life, it infuriated me that I couldn't tell her what I was going through, out of fear she would leave me.

Then, due to coronavirus, I lost hours at my job and was forced to move out from my place with her back to my parents, limiting the time I got to see her. My parents are very religious types that I clash with a lot and this caused my use to skyrocket to levels I had never gotten to before. I mean, taking out payday loan after payday loan to get 3 K-shot kratom extracts a day just to feel normal and stave off withdrawals, just to feel like a human somewhat. But finally the past has caught up with me, I'm completely fucking broke, and my partner still has no idea that I've been abusing extracts to insane levels these past 9 months, and I feel like the most guilty sub-human piece of trash on this planet. As of 12 hours ago I have quit extracts cold turkey (hopefully for good), and in constant fits of crying I'm so desperate to become a normal person again, not dependent on this vile life-destroying drug.

I don't know what to do. I feel so guilty for not telling my partner about basically any of this, and I don't know if I ever could. I'm so scared and feel so alone. I badly need to fix myself, I'm so fucking broken and emotional, and I feel like this is impossible. How can I do this? What should I do? I have no idea, I'm so hurt and self-hating so hard right now. How can I do this...",44,"{'rona': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9183631}"

I was taking a laughably small daily dose (1.5 g) after probably 5 years on and off this stuff. At my worst it was 15-20g a day. Generally I would start using again because I was depressed or bored and I’d conveniently “forget” that kratom is addictive. The last time I tried to quit I gave up in the PAWS stage. Then I came up with this idea that I could split the difference by talking a really low dose every day to keep the depression at bay without any of the down sides. Wrong. I was forced to quit even that small amount because my sleep was so fucked up with nightly withdrawals and I still felt irritable and numb and had low self esteem and all that crap. Well, 7 days into going CT and I feel freakin fine. Like, I feel normal and ok like I haven’t felt in years. So what’s my point? I guess my point is that quitting can look like a lot of different things and if you keep trying at it you’ll hit on the taper or the timing or the whatever that works for you.

It was just a constant worry at the back of my mind that I was less healthy than I would otherwise be, or that if I did get sick it’d be best to stop kratom which would mean facing WDs on top of illness.

The peace of mind of knowing I’m healing and trying to get my body right again, knowing that my body is as well prepared as it could be up until this point, better than if I hadn’t quit, is very rewarding.

I was addicted to pain pills for the past 6 years. I was addicted to dilaudid 4mg, & I was snorting about 90 pills a week. About 3 months ago I built up the courage to quit, & I decided to turn to kratom to help the withdrawal from the dilaudid, & it helped tremendously. The reason I turned to kratom to help was Bc the withdrawal from the dilaudid was god fucking awful & unbearable. But now I have a new evil to deal with & that’s the kratom withdrawal. My starting does with kratom was eight .5g caps every 2-4 hours (usually I would take 8 caps every 2.5-3 hours.) I would wake up & take my dose, take throughout the day every 3 hours, & take my final dose right before sleep. I’m not sure how much I would take a day total because some days I would stay up later & take more, & so days id fall asleep earlier & take less, plus I didn’t keep count. But I would go through a 300 capsule count about every 5-7 days. The strain I was taking was White Meang da. The main question I have is since kratom works on the same brain respecters as traditional opiates ( I know it’s a opiate agonist) does that mean I just delayed my dilaudid withdrawal? I have been taking kratom for around 3-4 months now & im planning on tapering. I’m thinking The way I’m going to taper is take one less pill every week. For example I take 8 caps a day now, tomorrow I will take 7 caps every 3-4 hours. Does this sound like a good plan? I’m trying to have minimal withdrawal symptoms. My withdrawal symptoms now if I don’t take any is my bones fucking hurt, mainly my legs & arms, RLS, insomnia, non stop sneezing, & rare diarrhea. But mainly the body aches is what bothers me most, I have a physical job & it fucking sucks to do when my body hurts. It feels like I’m moving through quick sand, & when I sit still & I notice it even more so it’s a lose lose situation. Just building up the motivation to get out of bed is a mission if I don’t take this shit. It’s extremely comparable to my dilaudid withdrawal, but not anywhere as close to as intense. What do y’all think? Think my taper plan will work? Did I just postpone the inevitable & it’s my dilaudid withdrawal coming back after 3 months of being clean off of that shit? How long can I expect withdrawal from kratom to last if I quit cold turkey with my doses/time taking it? Your opinions would be greatly appreciated.

After months and months of swallowing nasty green shit, you realize you haven’t worked on yourself at all. Kratom doesn’t improve your life I promise, it stagnates you and brainwashes you into thinking this is where you want to be. After chronic use you can easily see how detrimental this “supplement” ruins your life. Fuck kratom honestly, I never even like the feeling that much, just kept the edge off to quit weed. Prior to kratom I had the worst weed addiction. Just like kratom made me not care about weed, it also made me not care about anything. To anyone reading this, you are all stronger than you ever thought. Don’t let your fears stop you from realizing you need to change. Kratom drained the life out of my life. Took my ambitions to live a sober life right out the window. Living without kratom isn’t bad. It’s what real life is. Just listen to me real quick. Kratom makes you numb as shit. Maybe the withdrawals are all the negative feeling you were supposed to feel during your natural life compiled into a long stretch of agony known as “withdrawal”. If anything, we are experiencing what we should’ve experienced during all of the months and/or years using kratom. Took a hydro when I was younger, and didn’t feel anything close to what kratom made me feel. Shit isn’t a supplement. It puts a pause on life. Unless you are withdrawing from heroin, Or fentanyl, stay the fuck away. Withdrawal feels unpleasant, but not as bad as regretting everyday of life. It feels great knowing you got through the whole day without taking a substance. And also, don’t blame your mood on this substance. It’s us who didn’t listen to the recommended usage. It’s us who ate this shit thinking “it’s legal so why does it matter”. It’s up to us to change, just as much as it’s up to us to take another dose. Know your worth. Everyone in this earth deserves to live a life without needing fake happiness. It turns around. You soon realize that all other aspects of your life are fucked. We made a deal with the devil, fuck that. Listen to your heart. Shits been a crazy week for me but I know that I’m never gonna cave. The only person who’s going to change your life is you. Let’s all be happy sober. We all used to be amazing, happy, loving, and caring humans. What the fuck happened? Absolutely nothing. We just told ourselves that we need to take something to be happy. And that’s where things went wrong. I don’t care if I’m carrying addiction to my grave, at least I’ll know I lived a sober life. Whoever read this far thanks for reading and I wish you the best of luck. Same to the people who didn’t. Luck isn’t what we need though.

My plan to reduce the intake started and I dropped from 25 grams a day down to 18 grams a day for 1 week. After that week I dropped to 12 grams a day for a week. After that week dropped to 8 grams a day for a week. At this point you have dope sick headaches and your body feels weak. So the next week down to 4 a night for FOUR nights only. And this is the point where you stop taking it. IT IS A PROCESS! At this point you feel like you have a lingering hangover with mild case of dope sick shivers.

I know what fear is. I have been to rock bottom. I KNOW WHAT HOPELESSNESS FEELS LIKE. It is a miracle for me to feel this way at this point. My mood is up. I don’t feel like I am stuck in one place. 

**DO NOT CONTINUE TO TAKE 2400mg in one dose. THIS IS JUST AN INITIAL DOSE. GABAPENTIN HAS NASTY WITHDRAWAL EFFECTS IF YOU ABUSE IT.**

Next 2 weeks take (3x 800mg) a day spread out (1x 800mg in the morning, 1x 800mg @ 1 pm, and 1x 800mg @ 5pm).
After that 2 weeks I drop to 2x 800mg a day for 2 weeks (1x 800mg in the morning, and 1x 800mg at 5pm).
And then finally one week after that I drop to 1x 800mg in the morning for a week.

The only thing in my life that has changed and been consistent for the past 2 months is my daily use of Kratom. I would feel so exhausted on the days I didn’t dose that I absolutely needed to. I’ve noticed swelling in my ankles for the past week. I didn’t think much of it; it didn’t hurt and I figured it was from standing so much at work and being super lazy on the days I have off. But, I’ve read from sources online that Kratom can be especially hard on the liver, and when the liver can’t filter out the toxins, it moves to the kidneys. I’m really fearing that I have permanent kidney damage from Kratom at this point, or even kidney disease. Many of my symptoms are telling me so. I’ve had kidney infections in the past, but they were always quickly treated. 

Fast forward to today: my first day completely sober from Kratom for months. My legs are killing me. I surprisingly woke up with energy that I hadn’t felt in a long time; it felt like natural energy. But quickly through the day the fatigue started to set in. I notice my mood falling quickly as well, but I think that’s largely to do with my anxiety about my kidneys.",2,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7610291}"

It worked phenomenally for A little over a year. Then recently, it started to make me feel extremely anxious, intensely angry and have bad mood swings. 

I would try to cut back on my dosage, then I would deal with withdrawal symptoms throughout the day.
 Eventually, I decided to quit cold turkey. I knew that it was affecting my personality in negative ways. 
I had a horrible first week of nausea, constant headache, night sweats, anxiety. You name it.

Tomorrow will be 30 days, and while most of my physical withdrawal symptoms have gone, I still feel extremely exhausted. I have no motivation, I’m yawning and tired all day long, I cannot concentrate, and I’m feeling slightly depressed. 

I initially took Kratom for  energy because I have adrenal insufficiency. I have been taking supplements/medications for that for years. Essentially, my body does not produce enough cortisol and it affects my hormones in a negative way. I’ve always battled fatigue, so the Kratom was incredible at first. It gave me energy that I never had and I was able to accomplish tasks like never before. Then it just stopped working like that. I stopped getting the motivation and energy, and just started needing it to feel subpar. 

I am still getting extremely angry and irritable. I now have less energy than before. While it feels great to not be reliant on it, I’m starting to wonder if it was really the cause of my problems. I’ve never battled drug addiction, but I’m wondering if I’m just talking myself back into using it again. I know tomorrow is 30 days, but I wonder if all of the symptoms from quitting kratom should honestly last this long. I cannot live like this. I just want to have my energy back!

At Day 32-37, I was so proud and happy with myself for finally stopping Kratom. It’s now been 10 days later and I am still very proud of myself. But, it’s not to say that life still can be challenging and that I’m still recovering from my hardcore use of it (5 years, typically 30-40gpd). A lot of my posts have been motivational because I was so happy to no longer be in acute withdrawals. This post is more about the reality of a long term commitment off of Kratom. 

I will say I’ve noticed greater mood swings lately from having no energy to being so energetic it’s too much. My libido is off the charts (I guess my Testosterone has exploded). I noticed I am wayyy more stressed at times. I get a lot more angry at things that don’t matter. I definitely get PAWS and feel that uncomfortable backache thing that withdrawals do at times. I feel uncomfortable at times (idk how to explain it). My body will sometimes not accept that it’s over. My sleep is sometimes 11 hours, sometimes normal, sometimes 5-6 hours. It is like I am changing everyday. 

I often see people talk about the Day 40-50 hurdle and it’s a real thing. You are tested in a different way. You aren’t suffering anymore physically, but now you must learn how to consistently do the next right thing. You have to learn how to not only cope without Kratom, but to be happy without it. For some, it may be exercise, breathwork, eating right. For others, it really might be getting professional help and taking medication. Don’t discount something that might save your life and make you genuinely happy. 

Part of me recovering is learning how to not abuse other drugs and alcohol in the first place. I was definitely drinking way too much alcohol during my acute phase. I was also smoking weed a bit and had some Xanax to help when it got really rough. Virtually every substance has consequences when taken too much, and it sucks for people like us. I now am really cutting down the drinking, stopped the weed and Xanax. Alcohol was the hardest one but everyday I do it, it gets a lot easier the next day. 

I will say despite all of that, I am soo much happier without Kratom. The highs are so much higher. I can actually connect with people and genuinely care about the people in my life. My emotions are real now and I’m in control of my life.

At least without Kratom, you aren’t a slave anymore to dosing and taking it everywhere. You don’t have to worry about your hair falling out, having a low libido, hiding it, constantly lying to everyone and yourself, constipation, the up and down nature of dosing, traveling, spilling it on your stuff, finding a way to get it into an event conceal-ably, etc... The worst part, knowing that you have to stop and you won’t. Not believing in yourself. Also, knowing that when you stop, you will suffer intense pain and misery for awhile. It’s not a life to live. 

Those of you who still are trying to stop, please get help and make the change. You will not regret it once you are on the other side of this.

A couple days ago, I passed one month of being free from Kratom. After literally years of being a slave , it feels surreal to be saying that. I don’t think I missed a single day of dosing in 2018 and 2019.

This last month has had its ups and downs. I’ve had tons of random body aches and pains recently, more consistently in my neck for some reason, and I have no idea if that’s the withdrawals or something else. Did anyone else experience this? Not sure if I should go to the doctor or not. 

Sleep was really good for a week or two, then has gotten bad recently again. Thankfully, the RLS is almost entirely gone. I hope the sleep stabilizes soon.

When I sleep well, I feel amazing. Like a whole different person. Just need the good sleep to become consistent.

There have definitely been a few times when I thought about taking a dose again. It’s tempting , especially knowing my tolerance is mostly renewed now, but I am determined to keep this going.

I tried to taper with powder, but I never could be strict enough to adhere to it. For me drinking the God awful powder tea was a ritual, like alcohol, and I had too much history with both.
I switched to capsules. I no longer have to weigh out my doses, i just pack what I need for the day and thats all I get.
I quickly dropped from 80ish grams a day down to 30 in about 2 weeks.
For the last month I have been reducing by 1 cap per dose about every 2 or 3 days. 
I haven't noticed many withdrawal symptoms, but if i do, I add back 1 or 2. 
Slowly, almost without thinking about it i am at 10-12 grams a day.
On my days off when I can bear it, I hold off on my morning dose as long as possible, and that way I may even cut out 1 of my 3 daily doses.
I'm shocked at my success so far. I have managed a day at only 8 grams, but woke the next day with withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, depression, restless legs, fatigue) so I went back to 9 or 10 grams a day 
The cost of the caps are more. And I don't get that immediate feedback that I did drinking the sludge.
I don't know what will happen when I finally jump, but its gonna be much less than in the past when I jumped ct from 60 to 80 grams.

I stopped for about 3 days in march but couldn’t keep at it, and again in may but then i had my wisdom teeth taken out and had hydros and after i quit the hydros my withdrawals were unbearable. Well a few weeks ago i called up my ol best friend that lives in out home town (i moved away a little over a year ago to live with my finace) 

This best friend was the one who introduced me to kratom. I had spoken to him about us both quitting and he never seemed to truly want to like i did. But i called him and to my surprise he had been kratom clean for over a week and a half. Said he ran out and said fuck it and went CT. So i decided to do that as well. I didn’t think i could do it but somehow this was the easiest id ever had quitting? My acute withdrawals were minimum or even nil when normally i think i get them worse than most people. Today is two weeks CT and i feel soooooooo lazy.

Well a week or so ago their car died and they asked out help to help them move and i got PISSED. I started cursing at my finace that i “didnt want to fucking help them do shit” and that i “just wanted to go the fuck home and sit fucking down for a bit” - i just just being plain hatefull. I didnt curse *at* my gf but just at the situation. Luckily that is NOT how I normally act and my finace knows how hard kratom has been of a struggle for me and was very help and just said “i know you’re going through withdrawals but thats not an excuse and theyre our friends” and of course once we started helping i was in a good mood and happy yo he around my friends and see their new place. That same temper is affecting my work attitude. My job requires me to make sales and now when customers come in its no longer “ooo now its timw to make a sale!!” And in my head ir under my bearth im like “why the fuck do these fucking assholes have to come into my store right NOW ughhhhh” and i just cant get out of that mentality.

Any advice on how to stay motivated and happy? I feel like the anthesis of my regular self :( 

I think the required over time while my employees get their hours cut my corporate is really dragging me down as well. 11 hours a day 4 days a week in a store alone is driving me INSANE on top of these withdrawals.

Sadly the only thing that helps is my state has legal marijuana and smoking at home after work actually lets me relax but after K im hesitant to keep smoking because I obviously struggle with addiction. I just dont know how to make it through these days right now....",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.716035}"

Laying in bed with my eyes closed felt almost like being high if I exclude the hot flashes and horrible aching everywhere, also feeling like a leaf-eating junkie..!

One week ago today I woke up with pretty serious chest pains and shallow breathing. Went to sleep fine, woke up all crazy. Took a bike ride, it got much worse, even walking would make me stop in my tracks from the chest pain. It radiated to my upper middle back as well. All day I was confused, I’m a 33 year old guy in decent shape with no health problems whatsoever. 
Meanwhile, I started dosing kratom 1 year ago after discovering it through a friend in Portland. It was EXACTLY what I was looking for. A harmless, natural drug that just gives me a little edge on the day, a very mild mood booster and a little focus, and it’s NOT getting high. Perfect. Thing is within about 3 months I was taking at least 1 ounce or 30 grams a day. After 6, I averaged 2 ounces. So for the last 6 months straight I’ve been taking an average of 60g per day, and even got to an occasional 90 grams on boring days when I was just home all day. I was regularlyyy overdosing. Meaning like at least once a week I would wind up with real blurry vision and that mild confusion feeling. But that became tolerable in these last 3 months or so, and it was apparently worth it to me to risk overdosing in a daily attempt to feel the absolute most from kratom every day justtt before taking too much and getting that reverse effect. STILL, I had no idea there were ANY risks involved with kratom. The only light reading I did seemed to suggest no one knew anything, so I just told myself it must be fine. 
Well, 6 days later I am still getting heart/chest pain from WALKING. And it suddenly just dawned on me, “Hm...what about my kratom use?” I look it up and BOOM, everywhere, YES KRATOM WILL FUCK WITH YOUR HEART SERIOUSLY. And so now I’m just like fuckkkkk. I am NOT AT ALL okay with inflicting damage upon my fucking heart. This enlightenment literally all just happened moments ago, but I am seriously committed to quitting. But, because I never knew about the downsides, I’m also just learning about how difficult quitting is about to be through this forum! SO, I need some words of wisdom to get me through what I’m about to experience based on my dosing habits that I just outlined. I quit heroin 2 years ago after 4 years of use (but that is not why I started taking kratom at all), so I do know I can quit a serious drug when I’m serious about it, but I also had subs the first week for withdrawals. So idk how bad this is about to be, and I start work serving tables outside in the heat tomorrow, so I’m praying my heart tolerates it better on day 1 with zero kratom. Idk, but I hesitate to go to ER bc I saw one thread on here where multi ppl said they had chest pain, but their EKG was normal, they just had to quit. Although the idea that I may have actually had a mild heart attack 6 days ago is frightening af... what do you guys think. I am not trying to harm myself anymore now that I know kratom is damaging heart cells... not cool. I was just ignorant.

I still do WHM and cold showers every morning, but somewhere along the line I dropped the sun soaking sessions... Not sure why. Need to start doing it daily again.

If you're coming off of Kratom, and you feel less than human, try going out in the sun for a bit. Just don't get sunburned. I imagine sunburn would suck in withdrawal.

I have been a daily user of Kratom for 2+ year now. I did try to quit around a year ago and i had dreadful withdrawals which i couldn't handle and was back on this green devil dust. I would a stuck with the withdrawals if i could have functioned at work but i couldn't even get to work i was that bad. 

I take around 10g daily (Or i did)

Kratom has zero good effects for me anymore. I mean nothing at all apart from. Stopping withdrawals. That's it. Nothing more. It actually has more negatives now than positives. Everytime i dose i feel anxious. Sluggish' trembling hands. Just nothing of a benefit whatsoever. 

I went to my doctor and explained Kratom and how it affects the opiate receptor and i tried to quit before and couldn't. I took some paperwork etc on the plant as it's very unknown here. I have a very good relationship with my doctor and explained i really want to stop.

The doctor says for opiates we use 2 different medications. Methadone or Espranor (Buprenorphine). I says i wouldn't touch Methadone and asked about buprenorphine and she explained everything. So i says i will give it a go. I was prescribed 2mg that i was to take each morning.

First thing i had to do was stop Kratom for 2 days and then start this medication.

First morning i tried it. 2mg and as the day progressed all my withdrawals lifted tremendously but the 2mg dose felt far too strong for me.

Next morning i broke the 2mg into 4 peices so 0.5mg and i waited to see how the day progressed. Well i had no withdrawal feelings and felt the 0.5mg was a far better dose and never made me feel off.

I have been taking 0.5mg each morning for over a week and i feel 1000x better. No shakes. No anxiety. No worrying about packing doses for that day. My sex drive has returned. Feel like a new person tbh.

I know buprenorphine has a dreadful withdrawal. My doctor explained this but says once your stable we will very slowly taper you off. She says it could take months and months but it can be done.

Has anyone stopped buprenorphine and managed it ok? (Suboxone is a well more known name.. Same without naloxone though)

I have says it's just one addiction for another but i feel so much better tbh and this prescription doesn't cost me every month.

When I started this habit 2 years ago, I felt lonely, uwanted and feeling like there's nothing to look forward to in life, stuck in a well-paid but boring profession and having had no real intimate relationships for years.

Kratom alleviated the pain associated with these things, helped me go through each day. It didn't make me happy but it made life bearable.

Don't get me wrong, I know this is not the solution and that's why I made the commitment to quit.

I just feel like the mental component of staying away is so much harder than any of the physical symptoms. You see, as the apathy and boredom sets in, all I want to do is to be able to think of something that's ahead of me, something that makes it worth the pain, but I struggle to find anything.

If I could think of someone waiting for me at the end of this all, who will give me a fulfilling human relationship, I could grab onto that.

Or if I could think of some kind of exciting change that's realistic and not in the very far future, I could grab onto that too.

It's just that I can't think of anything like that, and this is exactly why I relapsed each and every time I tried to quit. Because as I got off kratom, life remained just as gray and dull, and I lost the only thing that helped me cope with it.

I've just invited someone out on a date, which was my only ray of hope for having something immediate to look forward to, but she said no, and I really can't think of anything else to keep me going.

Hello quitters,

Last summer I quit CT from 25-30 GPD. The withdrawals aas not pleasent as most of you can imagine. And damned as I am, I relapsed after a few weeks, when WDs seemed to disappear. Now I started to taper down (I am working, and i cant afford an other CT week at home). Actually I think quite successfully, I dropped from 20-25 GPD to 10 a few days ago, and its much more managable than CT, a few days and im ready to drop an other few grams. (I would have been much better to do this jn the quarantine at springtime (i live in the eu), but i was working on my thesis in theoretical mathematics and it was a super hard period already, so i was not able to quit kratom at that time). 

My first advice is that when you have quit succesfully do not think about taking it again. At all. I thought that it was going to be ok to take it just one or two times a week and i thought i can manage it. Well, i couldnt. Eventually i found meself back where i started. Although i dont know you, so maybe you could, but i think most of us cant, so if you care about yourself and dont want to go through this journey again and again, do not take it again after you have successfully quit. 

So what helped me sleep. First i tried kava and it was quite nice against the WDs but i was concerned about its effects on liver so i was not really using it (i know theres a debate about this, but i did not want to take the risks, since my liver could be already damaged by kratom, i hope not). But then i found mulungu (Erythrina mulungu), and i decided to write about it here, because it helped me so much, but it seems to me that its not too popular in this forum. I've done a little research on the internet and it seems to me that its not addictive and actually its a healthy plant. I have tried other natural sleep-aids, like valeriana or lemongrass, but these were not really effective moreover they strenghtened my nightsweats which was already quite bad on its own. But mulungu was effective. I took it an hour before falling asleep. The first thing with it is that it made me super calm. It took my anxiety away, which seemed to be a miracle, and this alone made it really worthy to use it. But moreover it helped me so much with sleeping. After taking it, it was not a problem to fall asleep, i did not wake up at night, and on the other day i woke up really reposeful and fresh. And i realised that a good sleep can help so much with the WDs. Even my mood was better and i felt less tired (still super tired because of WDs, but it was much better).

So I hope that with this post I can help some people quitting. Good luck on your journey, at the end you will not regret stopping it at all.",3,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.500871}"

I’m not great, but I feel good about the decisions I didn’t make in order to deal.

I woke up on Friday morning with the smell of meth around me and the taste of it in my mouth even though I was on the opposite side of the house from him. It made me throw up. I also woke up feeling jittery like I had too much coffee. I’m assuming because of some kind of horrible contact high, maybe my nerves, or both. It sucked. Not a fun way to wake up.

Then I was just worried about my dog. He pretty much stays by my side, so if I was breathing it then so was he. I took both of us outside for about an hour to get some fresh air and I called my cousin. I’m so grateful for her right now. She has been asking me to visit, but I kind of sprung myself and my dog on her very last minute. She agreed to have us, thankfully.

I didn’t want to try to have a serious conversation with him while he was in that state. He had clearly been up all night and he was high as hell. I was pissed the fuck off, but I just told him this whole meth thing is too triggering for me and I wanted to go visit my cousin for a few days. I thought he would put up a fight, but didn’t. He said he didn’t know it would upset me so much because of how long I’ve been off of it. I told him he’s delusional but that I would talk to him about it after he crashed.

Then I packed a bag, grabbed stuff for my dog, and drove 4 hours to her house. It’s been really good for me to get a change of scenery, but I’m upset. I got drunk with her and smoked a lot of weed. Not the greatest thing, but at least I didn’t turn to kratom for comfort. I’ve enjoyed being around her the last couple of days, even though I’ve been crying a lot. It’s the little things, I guess.

I didn’t tell her about the meth, but I was honest about the problems we’ve been having for the past couple of years. We’ve talked about breaking up before, and we both agreed that if that did happen, we would be amicable about it. Hopefully he still feels that way. I’m just so fucking sad. I still don’t even know what I’m going to say to him or even where the fuck am I gonna go in the middle of a pandemic? I have so much anxiety about the future. Just so many unknowns. I have no idea what’s going to happen or how things will pan out but I don’t have the capacity to worry about it right now. I keep bringing myself to the present and have been trying my best to focus on anything else besides kratom, my failed relationship, and all the other things that could potentially be triggering for me. I feel so fragile and I drank too much. I’ve been internalizing everything. I don’t really know how to feel or what to think about it. I’m at a loss for words. I’m just trying to wrap my head around it at this point. Maybe I’ll end up telling him absolutely everything I’ve been dealing with. I’m not sure yet. 

I want to thank everyone who commented. For the very first time, I didn’t get high on kratom in order to deal with a tough situation. I have all of you to thank for that. My situation definitely sucks right now, but at least I have this sub and everyone’s sound advice that I can turn to. It’s truly touching that complete strangers can do that for you.

Please Read Thru","Little over a year user of Kratom, around 40 to 50 gpd. That's down from 70 to 80 gpd tho. But currently feeling stuck at this. I start a new job tomorrow, damn good job btw. I took this jump down near 3 weeks ago and could be doing so much better than what I am however in the last 2 weeks I have made some positive changes. I've began working out pretty regularly with weights, pushups and whatnot, but also have taken on running, jogging and walking daily as well. I'm already up to 6 and 7 miles a day most days, truly hope I can stick to this with the start of this new job tomorrow. Gonna have to will myself to stick to it ya know. 

Today tho, me, my woman and her kiddos go to the local lake here where I live, (not huge but a good size body of water)and once before today I had come very close to swimming all the way across but began tiring out and decided to come back before I had made to the other side, got back fine with being a little worn out, no big deal. Back to today, with me working up to the 7 miles a day of running, jogging and walking (started at 3 or 4 miles a day) I figured I'd make it no problem being better fit cardiovascular wise. Literally got 80% (It's about a mile across I'd say) of the way I'd say and was just completely out of steam and air. Hate to say it, but realizing to myself I was not going to make it I started to panic and my breathing went to shit FAST. I began of coarse looking around for any boats or jet skiers and nothing, NO ONE out there on the water, I'm still 20% away from the side I was swimming to and 80% away from my family. I must have stopped swimming 5 or 6 times looking for anyone and still NOTHING.A At this point, NO BS, I know I'm fixing to die. This is all just 2 hours ago. I seriously make one last ditch effort to look around for a boat or jet ski and again, NO BS, two jet skis appear out of nowhere, mind you a decent size body of water but you can see all around to pretty much the entire thing even when swimming. I'm waiving my arms and yelling toward them as loud as I can knowing I'm expelling every last bit of oxygen I had left (I am panic breathing at this point of coarse) and they continously go back and forth idk like 4 or 5 times before they finally see me as I'm literally fixing to go under.
Pulls up to me finally LITERALLY saving my life. It was a Hispanic guy that could not speak English so difficult to even tell him how much he just saved my life. I have never held on to a stranger like I did on the back of that jet ski in all my life. We got to shore and I seriously hugged this man intensely saying OMG thank you thank you thank you as I am crying profusely which I could not stop doing so up until 30 minutes ago. 

This not being my first stupid stunt like this, (I purposefully got into a motorcycle accident not to long ago due to Kratom Rage...I know I know) I got to thinking afterwards about why I'd do something so incredibly stupid without any real forethought at all and figured it out. Since I have been on Kratom I have lost my confidence  motivation and resolve to the point that I feel so unworthy, useless and unwanted that I tell myself well if you don't make it, so what, your doing everyone a favor and no one loves you anyway. I realize I only think this because I no longer....if I ever did.....love myself. Never before but since being on Kratom I've wanted to end my life several times. 

I am currently with the most beautiful woman inside and out and she has 4 kiddos as so do I so right all together, she is 40 and I'm 45 btw. My 4 boys are grown and doing excellent in this world, I raised them well to be good respectable young men. She has 3 boys still at home, 13, 11 and 5 and one daughter at 20 and out of the house. Needless to say I have so much to be thankful for and live for but this Kratom has a hold of me. I've gotta get a start at this new job and begin to taper down from this poison. Looking for some much needed encouragement guys and gals. This stuff is really putting my mind and heart in a vise. I'm so ready to be free.
I hate to admit this but not a soul knows about my use. I know I know. The fear is just to much to do so. 

Long ago I had somewhat of a drinking problem and got over it fairly easily actually but this stuff has got me in this vise. I will break free, I WILL BREAK FREE!!! I've got to. I wrote this a while back on the alcoholism, I think it fits for Kratom pretty much as well.

conveying to you nothing but lies,

you'll lose your own ability to think.

he sits back smiling awaiting the hour,
to finally achieve what he's wanted all along,
cursing your soul to where only his belongs.
We don't have to let him win you see,
we have the choice and I choose to be free.
I hope you'll join me, in the end we'll win.
If you'll follow me, then we can begin.
To do what I've done, I'll show you the way. 
First things first, we'll sit and we'll pray,
and ask God on high to show us the way.
I've been there before and soon you'll know,
stop being the star of your own show.
Once you start slowly will you awake.
only then this life's test you'll get to retake.
Want what I have? Then do what I've done!
Soon you too will be living in the sun.
Away from the darkness you've so long called home.
Thru a life of freedom soon you will roam!

It's hard to imagine my life without kratom long term. And even more hard to imagine it sober, period.

But still I have this drive to seek out getting fucked up.

I found an unassuming container at a glorified gas station that I had read about briefly and thought I'd give it a try.

From the moment I took my first dose of red Bali, I knew I was onto something. It was the warm sensation that I was familiar with from other opioids. So warm in fact that I never felt the prick of the snake that had just bit me. 

For years the snake slithered around in my mind slowly injecting more poison into my body until it's venom was coursing through my veins. My wife told me there was something controlling me but I could never see it.

Then finally, one day I caught a glimpse of it in the shadows of my mind, and it's beady little eyes stared back at me mockingly. Years of free reign had emboldened this wretched creature, and it realized just how much control it held over me. 

Now that I saw it, I knew I had to kill it. I spent months tapering down only to find myself back where I started. The snake was laughing at me now because it thought there was nothing I could to to exercise it. Pissed off, I grabbed my machete and attacked it.

The battle lasted a full week. For the first 3 1/2 days it was beating me. My body shook uncontrollably, and every 60 minutes or so I was overwhelmed by a feeling of intense sadness, enough to bring me to my knees, screaming and crying like a baby. These episodes lasted about 20 minutes, afterwards I lie on my weapon briefly, but each time summoning the courage to pick it back up and get back in the fight.

After the dust had settled I realized how much I had given over the years to this monster. I looked at my family again, this time as if it were the first time. My conversations became important again, my priorities began falling into place. My energy had returned. Even the filtered sunlight peaking through the trees seemed brighter somehow.

If you are part of this group then you have caught a glimpse of this snake. Do yourself a favor and cut the head off the son of a bitch already and EARN your freedom back. You can't live or love fully on kratom, it extracts too big of a toll. The longer you wait the harder it will be.

I joked with a member that I wish I could mount the head of the son of a bitch on my wall. They suggested that a post might serve as my mount, as well as help someone else. So here is my metaphorical severed head. It's not as dramatic as a mount on a wall but more practical I suppose. 

I originally posted this over a year ago. Since then I can't remember the good feelings I had on kratom. What I remember was all those years I dragged my ass out of bed and dragged myself through the mud all day long, every day, over and over. I remember shame, guilt, hopelessness, and pain. I remember near divorce, suicidal thoughts, and anger. And I remember I chose all those things every day for years.

I haven't thought about kratom in so many months that it's just a fuzzy bad dream now. Quitting was the hardest thing I ever did, but as such, the most rewarding.

So I work at a very very hard job I’ll just say it’s either fedex or UPS don’t wanna risk my employer somehow seeing this, but I load the trucks from 1 am untill 10 am and it’s very very physical hard work, 2-3 times a week I also go on deliveries and work a double. So those days I’ll work 1 am to 6 pm. A lot of people struggle with this kind of work and that’s without any substance problems. 

My problem is if I don’t dose every 5-7 hours sometimes I try and push it to seven but very very hard. I’ll feel so fatigued and physically exhausted. I work so so badly when I’m in between doses. I want you guys to understand this is very very back breaking work but the pay is unbelievable and quitting my job their is not a option right now, Beacuse I’m about to switch to full time driving where I will make $40 a hour.

So my dilemma is how can I eventually quit while still being able to do my work, I don’t have any vacation days untill next year so I can’t take any time off. The most I can do is maybe take Monday off or Friday so I have a 3 day weekend. Do you guys think tapering will work? 

Please help a brother out, this stuff has made me a zombie all I do is work sleep eat. I literally sit at home any free time I have and watch tv I don’t do anything anymore. I used to run a eBay store, go fishing, go out on the weekend and I don’t do any of that anymore. I haven’t even been in the mood to get laid and I have had multiple opportunities, but all I feel is lazy and cloudy minded all the time.

Until recently I finally decided enough is enough. There HAS to be more to my life than this. This cant be the rest of my life...so I started tapering kratom, down from 100+ gpd to 20 with the goal of quitting completely as soon as possible. And I've been planning on finally, after suffering in silence all these years talking to my doctor about a medication, likely an SSRI or something, to treat my depression and anxiety.

&#x200B;

but what I'm wondering is if I shouldn't quit the kratom completely before I start a medication like that, to see if it helps. I want to start it really really soon, because I'm getting really bad lately. Terrible thoughts. but if its possibly kratom that is largely causing these feelings I can hold off and re access how I feel once clean from it.

I didn't too much about it, since you usually read that the withdrawals are rather mild. But reading some posts here made me a bit worried, and I think I don't wanna take it as far as many people here.

I think I'm using Kratom as sort of a replacement therapy right now, since I used to be addicted to Benzodiazepines, so I guess it's a step forward, but now it's time to get rid of the Kratom. I used to get by with 6 to 10g a day when I started, now I use about 25g a day, and I get more undesirable side effects, the most concerning one are rapid mood swings and I also can't sleep 8 hours after the last dose because Kratom induced Exploding Head Syndrome in me, I literally hear a loud ""WHOOOM"" just before falling asleep and would jump up in shock if I don't wait for 8 hours. Another concern is that Kratom might cause low levels of Testosterone, I started going to the gym a month ago, so this really isn't something I need right now.

But I can already see, this stuff is gonna be a bitch to quit. Even though Benzodiazepines are way more addictive, once I stopped and experienced withdrawal, I had absolutely no cravings. But with Kratom I would usually wake up in the morning feeling slightly sick and have strong cravings for it, it's just such a relief. In terms of withdrawals, I can deal with the physical symptomes, being jittery and having muscle tension, anxiety is also not really a problem for me, I was able to deal with strong benzo withdrawals. I'm just really scared of depression, I'd rather feel physical pain then to feel depressed, that's also a reason why I'm kinda procrastinating on quitting.

Just awful physical withdrawals and piling more and more into my system. It started casually and I’d never experienced addiction before kratom. It’s finally time to stop. 
Yesterday, I confessed the extent of this addiction to my wife. So scared it would break us to reveal how much I’d been hiding my use. If tried to taper casually before the pandemic but got a real case of the fuck-its in March. I’ve betrayed my wife’s trust but we are staying together. I am beyond grateful for that. 
I started an official taper yesterday but clearly I’ve underestimated how much I was using daily. I’m estimating 40-60gpd but I’m starting at 30gpd for my taper. Insomnia and awful RLS, lethargy, diarrhea, anxiety, body aches, and so much crying. I haven’t cried in I don’t know how long. 
I can’t do CT due to work responsibilities and my stepson. I think I have the fortitude for taper and luckily someone to hold me accountable. Im trying to cut back caffeine and pause drinking (which was getting a little too heavy during quarantine). I have a ton of supplements to try to help with physical withdrawals and if PAWS gets bad, I’ll try to see if my dr can up my Paxil or add in something non-addictive for anxiety. 
Trying to exercise, meditate, stretch, read, watch comedy, and remember all the good that will come from this. Doing this for my family, for the work that I need to be more present for, for the ability to really feel.

I had become pretty depressed with my work situation as well which kratom seemed to remedy.  It quickly turning into an every day habit and then into a more a day habit.

As is expected she is angry and disappointed.  In about 9 days I have tapered down to 10 gpd and am comfortable at this point.  My plan is to taper as much as possible before next Friday.  I will be able to take the following week off leaving me with 9 days to get through withdrawal and reinsert myself into some kind of recovery program.  I know that the secrecy that I kept around my usage was probably the biggest bar from taking steps.  I also know that I have to do this for myself.  I hope that my wife sticks around for this,  but I fully know that I might lose her as a result of my actions.  Either way I have made my mind up to reclaim the life that I had before I encountered this insidious drug.  At first I thought I could set it down whenever I wanted and that it was not as bad as other drugs.  Boy was I wrong.  Reading the posts here have been incredibly helpful.

Yesterday, jumping from 7g the previous day, I only took 3.5 g (2g in the morning, 1.5g in the early afternoon). Today, I woke up feeling entirely well. In the past 1.5 year, every time I woke up my first thought was that I had to dose. That was the first thing I did every morning. Today, I did not care. I felt OK. No skin crawl, no low energy, no cravings AT ALL.

My taper was very tolerable, I never felt cravings or anything unpleasant during it (contrary to when I tried CT, which was hellish).

I’ve been taking kratom for around 7 months. My habit got so bad, and I started reaching doses up to 28 gpd. I bought a one ounce bag a day from the head shop near me because it was the only way I used to be able to control myself from using more. I used to get the kratom online but it was too much to have. Anyways, about a week or 2 weeks ago I cut my dosage in half. Then I started lowering it little by little and today I took 6 or 7 grams (I don’t have a scale, I took 3 little teaspoons of it). I was just wondering is it better to take the dose all at once, or split up because I’ve been trying to just take one dose at night before bed. I feel the withdrawals by the time the night comes and I just feel like I’m freezing and I can barely move because I’m so drowsy and tired. Is this good progress? I don’t know if I should take another dose before bed, I might just take some kava instead. I don’t really have a taper schedule per say, I’ve just been slowly lowering the doses. I know it’s not good to eyeball. I might have to grab a scale at the headshop. Just so sick of buying shit for this stupid ass plant, or to help me through the tapering process. I hate this stupid plant but I’m taking my life back. Started kratom to quit a terrible 4 year pot addiction that started when I was 15. Sometimes I don’t feel anxious without the kratom, just sick as hell. I’m ready to take my life back. I have to suffer now for a great future. Thank you guys for reading and being a very supportive place. My heart goes out to some of you who’ve used kratom to get off of opiates, as well as people with very bad addictions that have been going on for years. We can all do this.

I'm still biting my tongue though. I may not be saying that in the next couple of days. Anyways, Physical WD has been very light(I'm comparing that to heroin). As always, the mental part is the hardest to overcome. Depression hits full force, lack of enegry and motivation are the toughest for me. I really sucks because I start craving my main DOC's which are true opiates -_- but like over comming any type of addiction, you just need to keep reminding yourself of where drugs will lead you. Remind yourself how much better life was when you were sober. Even if life sucked sober, its 10X's harder while enduring active addiction. Drugs, including KRATOM can rob you of everything. Your finances, your mental health, your relationships and ultimately turn you into a person you're not meant to be. I believe each and every one of us has our own unquie purpose in this world and when we fog our minds with substances, those purposes will go away.

Best tip I can give to anyone trying to overcome addiction is finding some type of spiritual guidance. Its near impossible to battle addiction on your own. Whether it be God, or just any type of higher power, use it. Believe in it. Its the only thing that's helped me in the past and brought me pure natural joy. I was astonished how happy I became after quitting heroin from using spiritual guidance. Especially since I was a non believer before that... 

NA is great too if you find a good meeting with people who are serious about recovery. And dont feel like you wouldnt belong in NA if all you've ever used was kratom. They will accept you as well and want to help. Kratom can be just as destructive as any other drug if you allow it. Dont be naive and think just because its natural or legal that it doesnt count.

And to those who are trying to quit or have quit and are struggling, stick to it! It really gets better fast!

I was struggling with depression, anxiety, nightsweats (RAGING NIGHTSWEATS) and excessive underarm, palm, and feet sweating at about 7 days but that has slowly receded. Still a bit sweaty during the day but it only happens if I let myself be swallowed by anxiety. This is important for everyone, I believe just forcing yourself into the situations that initially cause anxiety help that anxiety. Being around people, although initially I absolutely hate it, really helps a ton! The nightsweats broke at about 2 weeks. I slept without waking up drenched for the first time this morning! Only 13 days in!!

The anxiety and depression still linger but are much more bearable and I find I have a good day, full of joy, and then a bad day, full of negativity but if I force it out the negativity fades away eventually.

Mornings really are the worst in kratom withdrawal, the afternoons get better and by the evening I feel decent, normal, baseline, things interest me. This is a stark contrast with opiates, as I have been through methadone withdrawal, for 5 days at least before I folded back to kratom. The opiate withdrawal is 50x worse than kratom withdrawal. There is NO WAY I could beat opiates on my own as I have with kratom. 

You have all been a godsend, thank you so much for the support! Tapering down for 3 months was hell but necessary, from up to 100 grams per day to 10 per day and then I cold Turkey'd it and here we are 2 weeks later. 

Stay strong brothers and sisters! Being sober from kratom is so much better than the withdrawal and hangovers from kratom. I think about buying some everyday, and its everywhere! But I stomp those thoughts with the thought of the chills, extreme sweating (day and night time) crying, bodily pains, and crippling anxiety. I felt I couldn't accomplish anything for a week but it has passed. Exercise really helps although quite hard initially.. my heart was beating crazy fast for like 10 days, it has slowed down, and with lung damage (excessive cigarettes and covid damage, please stop smoking cigs now if you do) it is really hard to catch my breath.

I went 3 days in a row with literally 0 hours, and every night SUCKED. My anxiety went off the charts. I turned to substances, namely Kratom to alleviate my anxiety.

I wanted to justify it, it’s just a plant, it must be amazing for everyone. Long story short Kratom stole a lot from me in just 2 months. I had 0 real life ambition, less passion, less enjoyment of others, and I started to feel & act “slow” or “dumb.” All that I can say is that in my experience daily use of Kratom was very detrimental.

Over the past 5 years I’ve used either kratom, heroin, Methadone, Suboxone...and have kicked all of them at some point. OUCH
Most recently it’s been the OPMS tinctures. (Have kicked those too at an amount of 5/day....ouch again! - had psychosis and such)
So I tapered my tincture use to 1/day or every other day. Then I did one day of powder - 3g only and then took 300mg gabapentin to sleep and woke up today feeling moderately normal. The last time I had any gear was over three weeks ago, and believe me I’ve wanted it. 

The day is young. 9am

Of course I miss the rush of OPMS but I’m in IOP and have a recovery coach and have been trying for a solid 3 years to maintain abstinence. My favorite time to use was morning. 

Supplements I use for anxiety are: l-theanine, GABA, holy basil, and lithium orotate. 
GABA (not gabapentin) takes away the rls and helps me sleep....along with Indica gummies.

For anhedonia I take acetyl-l-carnitine. It’s been the only thing that helps. 

Is this my time? I don’t know. I’m approaching this try quietly...keepin it to myself because I’m tired of the pressure to stay abstinent that occurs by telling others (except you all). 

I have CPTSD and anxiety disorder since start of pandemic and moving in the middle of it after being in old house for 8 years. We also moved to the hood where I witnessed a shooting within the first month being here. So....oh yeah I’m also a caregiver to partner who has cirrhosis and is also sober with early onset dementia. (If you’ve seen my YouTube videos you know by now who I am) I’m in grad school and unemployed at the moment for the first time since I was a kid.

Do I have what it takes this time?

I don’t know. 

But, the day is young and I’m gonna see what happens....

2020-08-20 17:50:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/idjpj7/concerns_during_kratom_detox/,Concerns during kratom detox.,"I started taking kratom about a year ago. At first it started with about 7 grams every 6 - 8 hours. However it progressed  little by until I found myself taking 30 - 60 grams every single day. First it stopped being effective, then it started making me physically sick, now I am so mentally & physically sick that I am afraid I need to go to the er. A couple of months ago is when the really negative effects started coming pronounced. Kratom was no longer serving me. I was now serving it. My life turned into a constant need to know how long ago I had dosed & how long i had until i could dose again. That is when i started researching trying to quit & first tried to taper. Well I couldnt do a slow taper. It's like I would take one step forward & 2 steps back. 3 days ago I decided to cut my now stable dose of 24 grams per day broken into 2 doses every 12 hours in half. For the last 3 days I have been taking 12 grams once daily every 20 hours. I tried to make it to 24 hours but at the 20 hour mark the detox becomes too much. The first day was not so bad but the last 2 days I have experienced every detox symptom along with an racing heart even when I am resting. I feel like I want to jump out of my own skin. Yesterday while driving in traffic I had the worst panic attack of my life. I felt like I was fighting to take every breath. I have acquired some thc to use throughout my detox & have 1 mg of xanax left. I have been taking .5 mg every night to help with the shaking & to be able to sleep a few hours at night. I'm worried that my heart could stop or that I am taking a chance with my life. I have 4 young children at home who need me. I started taking kratom as a safe & natural alternative to pain management clinics. I should have done more research. I should have been more disciplined in my use.

I've been lurking around here for a while as I slowly came to terms with the fact that I'm addicted to Kratom! I held off posting because that would really make it real that I'm going to quit. But now I want it to be real, and I'm ready. I'm on my 2nd day of tapering and I'm wondering if I did it too fast cause I slept like shit last night and I'm feeling hella emotional (may or may not be crying as I write this). As an FYI I've used it for about 7 months and usually have about 20 grams/day (sometimes with binges of more).

My goal is to taper until September 6th when I have a week off from school and use that time to quit no matter what. I know that isn't a lot of time to taper but I just don't want to wait any longer and a week off seems like a good time to go for it.

I've used various other drugs as a crutch throughout my adult life but I ended up kicking them all and having a period of fabulous sobriety! Kratom seemed so innocent because it's legal and ""all natural"". It has helped me through this tough time of Covid, going to school, working nights, and being a live-in caretaker for my mom. But now I'm freaking addicted and I can't stand it. I hate living my life according to an addiction, and have already noticed some bad side effects like bad breath, constipation, mood swings, body pain when I skip a dose, and a foggy, groggy feeling that keeps getting worse. I know if I don't quit now, it's just going to be a downward spiral, and get harder and harder to ever do.

I just want my life back and this seems so daunting right now. I've tried to quit before and I know the odds are against me, but I know my desire to get through it will be enough. I'm too ashamed to let anyone in my life know what I'm going through, and it's hard to do it alone, so I'm hoping for a bit of encouragement from across the interwebs...I've already gotten so much inspiration from reading everyone's posts, and that helped me to get to where I am now.

Preparing to leave it behind.,"Hey guys, this is just a quick post about where I'm at in my journey. I'm writing this mostly to gather my thoughts and to share my experience. And maybe so that you can help me keep on track.

I have been using kratom for 2 years now. When I started, I was at a very bad place mentally. My life was stable and comfortable, with a well-paid profession, but I didn't have any passion for anything anymore, I had no real plans or ambitions of my own, only the monotonous drudgery of what I thought I should be doing, and I had no personal relationships of a quality that give your life meaning - or so I felt.

Kratom provided a huge relief from this. It made me feel content, balanced, more able to focus on monotonous work and all the benefits you all surely know well. At first I simply planned to use it every once in a while, when I needed a mood boost, but sure enough I was a daily user in a matter of months.

In the past 1.5 year, I was using between 10 to even 25+g a day (the COVID lockdown was the time I hit my all time low - locked into my apartment with no one to talk to for months was unbearable).

I tried to quit both CT and via tapering on multiple occasions. When I tried CT, after about 10-12 hours I lost practically all ability to do anything productive. I just wanted to lie down and do nothing. When I had no access to kratom (for example, I forgot to purchase it before the Christmas season), the process was always:

1. shakes, depression, exteremely low mood/energy
2. a kind of extreme emotional volatility, where the simplest things made me emotional and I felt an intense need to connect to others. Honestly, this is kinda pleasant. It's like life opening up before you again, like you're being let out of solitary confinement. I notice people interacting with each other in a kind way and start to smile myself, I see the beauty in simple stuff. It feels good.
3. depression hits hard again

That third stage was always the point where I gave up. I am self-employed and I always have assignments scheduled for at least a week in advance. I could not let myself not work. So I bought the stuff to be able to carry on with life.

And with my previous tapering attempts, I always felt 'calmed down' when I got down to around 10 g, telling myself 'OK I've got this under control, I can quit any time', and then I jumped back full force again.

So, what changed? I'm not sure, but one thing is that I recently hit 30 and I had to take stock of where I'm at in life. Yes, I have achieved some things I didn't think I would by this age, and that make other people think that I should be quite content. Yet somewhere along the way I have also left behind things that used to be my dreams.

I realise now that a major contributor to the severe anxiety that made me start taking kratom was that I wasn't living aligned with my own values. I was chasing money in a job I didn't enjoy, in order to be able to buy things that, while nice, do not make me any happier, and to meet some arbitrary criteria of what success is.

What anxiety tells you is that you are not doing what you know you should really be doing. Kratom silenced that anxiety, it helped me, to quote Pink Floyd, not have to 'trade cold comfort for change'. The old me, the me with passion and drive is still in there, and I have to let him out so that I can find my purpose again.

So, I have been tapering - using capsules this time, as they make it harder to cheat - down from 13g, and now I'm at 7. I'll probably make the jump after 5.

Wish me perseverance.",3,"{'covid': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44830203}"

I wish I would have done it sooner. I was just so afraid of how “hard” it was going to be to quit. Until I decided to rethink the situation. In my opinion being addicted is harder than being in recovery. I’m not saying recovery is easy by any means but think about it. It is harder to sneak, lie, poison your body, isolate yourself, neglect relationships, waste money, and be a slave to a substance!

I measure and 'cap' the doses in condiment cups at the beginning of each morning, and I'm also trying to not consume all of the measured dose when I take it.  For example, yesterday was officially supposed to be 5.6 grams but I only consumed 5 grams during that 24 hour period. 

The fact that I'm able to end the day with a small amount of kratom left over seems like an encouraging development, and it gives me hope that I might be able to jump with a minimum of withdrawal symptoms. 

To be on the safe side, I'm prepared for the possibility that I will experience some degree of withdrawal symptoms for four or five days after I jump. These symptoms are likely to include insomnia, endless muscle aches, fatigue during the day, irritability, and intestinal distress. 

However, d**uring this pandemic, I'm spending most of my time at home with my wife and daughter. My wife knows about the kratom taper and withdrawals; my daughter does not. By the time I jump, both my wife and daughter are likely to be really caught up in school and work, but they're pretty perceptive and likely to notice changes to my personality.**

I said to myself I’m just gonna chill on the porch today, avoid conflict, focus on getting over the taper hump and into the part where I get better. 

I walked outside and see a package. I knew immediately what it was, a kilo of kratom that got lost In the mail back in may/June.  Musta been caught up in one of those sorting machines that were dismantled. Fffffuuuuuuuuck!  


I have a friend that takes it still.  Thinking about giving it to him or just trying to sell it on facebook or something 

Trying like hell to avoid looking at it, my brain is saying “go ahead and take a 12 gram dose and you can get back to the taper tomorrow” but I’m not gonna let it win.  

This is a test from the universe.  Every time I try to quit something the universe dangles it in front of my face and says “deep down we both know you’re not going to quit, let’s stop lying to ourselves and stop the torture.”

I remember a decade ago when I finally spent my entire bank account on OxyContin and was 48 hours into detox.  My girlfriend’s dad stopped by and handed me a bottle of 88 perc 10’s and said “I heard your back hurts, I got these but only took 2, they made me really siick”.

A year after being sober for H I started using Kratom here and there, and dosed lightly it’s been about two years now and now I dose three times a day, in the AM I do two big heaping tablespoons and then repeat around late afternoon and then at night I do about four heaping tablespoons so I can make it through the night without having withdrawals. Until I wake up again around 7am and repeat the cycle all over again. I need to cut back and I just don’t see an easy way of doing it , I know from being addicted to H that quitting is never easy. However this time I have a 13 month old daughter , so I can’t just lay in bed this time while I withdraw.

Some of you may remember that I became pregnant while using probably into the triple digits (I am not proud of this) as far as GPD go. I began taking kratom for severe chronic pain. I IMMEDIATELY dropped my dosage down to around 60, and tapered to about 36, which is when I started weighing and recording my doses every day all day. I've been at it for months. I stalled out to semi stabilize around 26 gpd. I have continued to taper down, roughly .5 every 3 days, sometimes taking a day extra, but rarely. I have reached about 15.3, and have absolutely hit that dreaded wall. I knew it was coming. 

In the beginning of my pregnancy, I reached out to my OB and was completely honest about my situation, hoping they could help me cope better with this. Not for me, but for my baby. WDs are incredibly dangerous to an unborn child. The only help they offered me was was MAJOR pressure to be prescribed Suboxene, with zero option to taper before delivery. When I respectfully declined, she prescribed me Hydroxyzine, after I explained to her that antihistamines aggravate WD symptoms, and the restlessness was the worst part for me. She neglected to tell me that it is basically Benadry on steroids. Luckily, I Googled it before I took it. I feel like I was sabotaged with the primary objective of me giving up and accepting the subs...but that's a different story... 

 I would love to just rip off the bandaid, but CT is  not an option.  I have not slept more than 2 hours at a time in months, and these last 4-5 days, I have not slept more than 1. I pace around my house all night, because the restlessness is unbearable. I constantly feel like someone is choking me. I have a daughter, and we live live way off-grid, and we run a legal cannabis cultivation operation which is all a TON of work. It has been at least 100 degrees, with no AC, so that has added to my fun... 

Anyways, where I'm going is that last night, i took a few of my doses early, desperate to get some sleep, which led to me taking an extra 1.2 grams this morning, in order to semi function enough to be a mom and attempt to tackle some of my responsibilities. I feel like I've failed at my taper and set myself back. I am also starting to panic, because i am 27 weeks pregnant, and running out of time. I wouldnt care about the insomnia and WDs as much, if I were not worried about them hurting my baby.... I cant have her born with it in her system and dependent (obviously,) but these WDs can be incredibly dangerous, especially when I dont sleep. AT ALL. I cant ask my doc for help, because they will probably call CPS on me for not accepting the subs and all of that. I already feel incredibly guilty for being in this situation. I love my kids more than I can express, and do absolutely anything for them. 

I take magnesium, vitamin c, CBD, l-theanine, and a pregnancy safe skullcap tincture. I cant take BSO, or really anything else. I have no idea of gaba or agmatine are safe, but I cant consult my OB. 

I guess all I'm asking, is do you think i have set myself back with that extra 1.2 grams? Will these WDs just continue to get worse?

I cant talk to my fiance about it. He really does not understand, and I cant help but feel a little judged, even though he really is great.

DISCLAIMER: Everyone is different. Suboxone is a seriously powerful drug, and comes with a host of its own issues and risks. I don't recommend the following method as a universal solution, and it won't work for everyone and could be a disastrously bad course of action for some. YMMV, significantly. 

I started K in an unspectacular way, likely similar to many others. Ironically, I spent a decade in Thailand and was very aware of kratom, but had never tried it. Although it originates there, it's illegal and pretty hard to come by unless you have some serious connections in the south of the country. Anyway, fast forward and I repatriated to North America, and I was aware you could obtain kratom quasi-legally through online sources, and my curiosity was piqued. I'm a life-long partial ""drug enthusiast"", partial alcoholic/addict. I definitely identify as a recovering alcoholic, not so much as a recovering addict (other than kratom), although I've certainly delved headfirst into various drugs at different periods throughout my life. The furthest I'd gone with opiates was a year-long combined codeine/tramadol/dihydrocodeine binge. Interestingly, I was super productive during that period, felt like superman at both work and with family life; something that would feel all too familiar when I started kratom. The withdrawals from the above ""opiate ride"" definitely sucked, but was over in about a week or two. So anyway I ordered the kratom, tried it out, and it reminded me exactly of my previous opiate experience: far more stimulating than sedating, but surprisingly subtle, very productive, and in general just made me feel ""good"", but not in an intoxicated or out of control way. Seemed almost nootropic for me, and I thought I'd found the perfect low-risk low-consequence elixir to boost my life.  I was hooked immediately and within a few weeks went from starting out at 5 mg a day to basically just chronically spooning it in my mouth (somewhere around 100 gpd) all day. I felt good, didn't feel any serious consequences, so I got on the K train and just kept on riding it.

I was mildly aware of the risks of kratom, but I either subconsciously or accidentally was blowing off the risks and listening to all the kratom users who claimed there was no withdrawal and few negative consequences. I think in retrospect I knew deep down that it was too good to be true and I was playing with fire, but any concern I had was quickly pushed aside with the casual self-assurance of ""I'll just taper and quit later"" that is all too familiar to anyone with an addictive personality. 

Flash forward around 6-7 months, and the benefits of kratom had all but disappeared. I was taking 100+ gpd, to the point of feeling sick and having constant wobbly eyes where I couldn't even shift my eyes to check peripheral vision without feeling a dizzy vertigo. I was combining with benzos and occasionally alcohol, so was sleeping great but the days just felt stale, sick and empty. So I decided it was finally time to stop the kratom. I figured I hadn't been on it that long, as I'd read of others using it for years, so I didn't think to taper - just stopped taking it one day without any idea of what was about to happen.

First thing that happened was I couldn't sleep. At all. I'm no stranger to insomnia, but this was different - I could tell there was something seriously wrong, and felt this overwhelming internal restlessness and a dysphoric alertness. I suffer horribly from the after effects of poor sleep, even under normal circumstances - it makes me depressed and anxious the next day. So this initiated a vicious circle of zero sleep at night and feeling exceedingly awful in the days. At about Day 3-4, the RLS, rock-bottom depression combined with unbearable anxiety/panic, led me to realize that something seriously wrong was going on (I STILL didn't know it was kratom withdrawal at this point). My first instinct was that I was going through benzo withdrawal, a hell I've experienced before. So I started popping benzos like candy........... except it wasn't working. Maybe slightly reduced anxiety and provided an hour or two of sleep, but I still felt the worst I had in my life. I must be extremely prone/sensitive to kratom withdrawal, because as the next week went on, I just kept nose-diving into an absolute indescribable hell. Depression and anxiety so bad that for the first and only time in my life, suicide seemed like a viable option. I couldn't get out of bed, I was either freezing cold or drenched in sweat, couldn't stop shaking and kicking, crying and screaming, and I wanted to just jump out of my mind - it was a state of constant torture in there, and nothing could relieve it. By this time I had finally figured out what was going on with some shaky-handed Googling. So then began the questions. How long was this going to last? Was there anything I should be doing to help alleviate it? Is this really kratom withdrawal or is something else going on? Not knowing any of this made it all the worse. My kratom habit was a secret, but I had to come clean with my wife and parents, who were at this point at my bedside and mortified. 

Somewhere in the second week, with still no relief and now losing feeling in my extremities, I threw in the towel and went to the hospital. They weren't familiar with kratom, so did a bunch of their own research on the spot. After determining that this was definitely opiate withdrawal, they explained to me about suboxone, including the risks, the tapering requirement, and the eventual withdrawal. I would have done anything for relief at that point, so I agreed to go on suboxone. They gave me 4 mg, and within 20-30 minutes I felt complete and total relief. I got up and walked out of the hospital feeling completely normal, as if a switch had been flipped in my brain. After going home and sleeping straight through the night, I woke up and started to do some research on suboxone. Realized I might have been jumping out of the frying pan and into the fire, so decided I wanted to start tapering off suboxone immediately. I made this clear to the prescribing doctor and they were a bit hesitant; they were clearly unprepared for my unusual case since they are usually dealing with people coming off heroin or fent, and the norm seems to be really long maintenance doses. I was persistent though, and just kept cutting my dose every few days. During this time I felt completely normal, slept totally normal, no real high or euphoria, maybe a bit more energy felt every day after taking my suboxone dose. That is, up until I started cutting below 2 mg (this would be about a month after I started). At this point I was definitely feeling withdrawal effects, namely in the way of depression, anhedonia, and fatigue. However it was manageable, and I was still able to work and get through my days, so I trucked onwards, tapering slowly. It took about another two months (so 3 months total start-to-finish) to taper completely off. I definitely didn't feel good during those last two months, but it was a low-key shittiness rather than the freight train collision during the kratom withdrawal. I jumped off suboxone at somewhere between 0.1 and 0.25 mg (tough to cut the pills exactly).

Now I wish I could say it all got better from there, but unfortunately the two weeks after completely jumping from suboxone were undeniably pretty brutal. Insomnia returned, and the fatigue and depression were crushing. The helper meds (clonidine and gabapentin) didn't help much. I was terrified that this was my new normal for months to come. However I'm thankful to say that after about 10 days, improvement was seen, and within 2-3 weeks I felt back to 90%. While coming off suboxone was certainly difficult and not to be taken lightly, I remained functional throughout my suboxone taper and withdrawal. 

Once I jumped I never looked back, and I'm happy to say that I am now kratom and suboxone free, and feel excellent. I can confidently say I will never touch either of these substances again. 

One thing I have contemplated during this time, and something I'm sure others will be thinking, is whether I would have been better off just ""toughing out"" the kratom withdrawal for another X days, since it would have been over more quickly and not as drawn out as the suboxone ordeal. I guess this is a question that can't be answered. If someone had told me during kratom withdrawal that ""you'll be better in 2 days"", I probably could have stayed the course, but the variability in people's experiences and the not knowing made it all the more awful. For me, I was in crisis-survival mode when I made the decision to go on suboxone. For me, it was the right decision at that time, and while a difficult experience, it was ultimately successful. As I said in my initial disclaimer, it's not going to be a good idea, probably for most kratom users, but I do believe it provides a viable option for anyone that suffers severe withdrawal from kratom.

I need you’re advice and insight on this taper.,"So. Last week on Friday i was using on average 120 gpd of caps. Actually more as the caps i use are .6g instead of .5. Im here because I feel guilty and I have some questions. Saturday. I went 20 hours before withdrawals worse than any other drug I’ve ever tried kicked in. I was literally soaked in sweat. RLS like I was being electrocuted in my whole body constantly. Diarrhea etc etc the works but worse than anything ive ever experienced. Instead of cold turkeying. i decided to taper because how bad the withdrawals were, and i needed to perform at work. I work with heavy equipment and sharp things so having a few sleepless nights in a row is just not an option or id be putting myself at danger. Essentially, im feeling guilty as fuck for not sticking to cold turkey, but i know it wouldnt have been for the best. Ive reduced my intake to about 40 grams per day and I’m writing every dose down in my notebook. Im also feeling guilty because I can feel the dose.. instead of taking 15g of caps in one go im taking 5, 8 times a day. I dont know if its just relief from the withdrawal symptoms or if im getting high. I think its the latter but im guilty none the less. 

Furthermore I had a few questions for those who have chosen to taper. What was the timeline like for your recovery? Was it harder and harder the more you tapered down? Did you get any physical symptoms or were you able to sleep? Im just worried I will have to take time off of work and thats something I literally cannot afford because of rent bills and student loans and everything else. How was your mental game while tapering and after you jumped? Im just scared, but i know I will have to accept what comes, i just want to know what im in for as ive only ever went ct in the past. 

I could use some words of encouragement. I could also use a dose of reality for what is to come. Should I feel guilty for choosing to taper? Does that make me weak? I surely feel weak right now.

2020-08-18 12:00:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ic3qfe/60_days_thank_you_all/,60 days! Thank you all.,"TL;DR: Insomnia and chronic back pain were / are my major issues. PAWS hit strong for me between 40-50 days after quitting. I've been practicing Wim Hof Method breathing exercises and cold showers daily since my second week. Wish I would have started it sooner... or even while still tapering. That's how effective WHM has been for me. Today I'm doing well. Ever vigilant! Kratom addiction / relapse can be sneaky. This sub has helped me tremendously! I can't thank you all enough. Those of you whom I have regular or semi-regular interactions with... you know who you are. I'm eternally grateful.

Long form:

At 4:30pm today I will have 60 days since my final Kratom dose. I really do feel like it's ""coming all together"" now. I feel the best that I have so far since quitting... physically, mentally and emotionally.

I tapered for 7 weeks after using daily for 3 years, 20 - 30 GPD. I jumped at 3GPD.

Days 1 - 10: My back pain and insomnia were my biggest nemesis. Back pain began to improve after a week. It's still a daily chronic issue, but nowhere as bad as when I was using, especially my last year or so. Managable RLS and arm switches began to dissipate after about 3 nights. Runny nose in the morning, sneezing, some coughing. Minor cold-like symptoms. I was always cold for about the first month. Wearing a hoodie in the summer became normal for me. Again, not really a big deal. Mood swings were all over the place. No real cravings for Kratom. It's hard for me to pin point when acutes subsided and when PAWS started. The two kinda' blended together in the middle it seems. Insomnia was my #1 issue.

Days 11-40: Kind of a blur here. Probably nothing major happened other than continued daily back pain. I started sleeping more than the 2 - 3 hours I was getting nightly after 3 weeks of quitting. (1 month total insomnia, because it started during the last week of my taper.) I got about 6 - 7 hours sleep per night for about 2 weeks and then...

Days 40-50 happened... Ok, this is *real* PAWS right here! Talk about mood swings! Wow! Anyone old enough to remember the 1976 movie ""Sybil""? Mood swings during this period were much worse, for me (and for those around me), than during the acute withdrawal stage. Unreal! And now Insomnia came back. One night I'd get 5 hours sleep (ok, not bad, I'll take it) the next night 2 hours. One night nothing at all. It was also during this 10-day period a hurricane / tropical storm hit my state and we were without power, water and AC for 5 days. Some moments were ok, others were frustrating. The sniffles and some sneezing even came back during this time. And for those who are new or unfamiliar with PAWS... No, it wasn't a cold! Because by 11am - Noon these symptoms always cleared up... until the next morning. It was like my body was withdrawaling from Kratom again, but I hadn't used Kratom in 40 - 50 days. There was one point that I questioned myself whether I had used in a brief period of sleep. Obviously I had not. But it felt like I did. Very strange and pretty scary. I personally feel these withdrawl-like symptoms were totally mental... like they were produced by my brain ""short-circuiting"", so to speak. Back pain also got worse than it had been during this period. Luckily Ibuprofen and CBD flower were helpful. These are the strongest things I've taken. I want to keep it that way. That's my personal choice. I understand and respect that it's not everyone's.

Days 50-60: Major improvements! Attitude has improved a lot. No more ""Sybil""! I average 5 hours sleep per night. It's not great, but not terrible. I'm functioning fine during the day on that amount of sleep... although I'd prefer 6-8 hours. But, for now, I've accepted it. It's surely better than 2-3 hours of broken-up sleep every night. I still ""battle"" the back problems daily. I feel best in the morning. Afternoons I get a little achy / minor pains. But every evening around 5pm, like clockwork, here comes the pain! This makes sense if it's mentally / brain connected. For a long time my last dose of the day was typically between 4 and 5pm. (That ensured me falling asleep by 10 - 11pm more often than not during my peak usage.) 

I don't believe I've had one ""serious"" craving (yes, they're all serious... but you get my meaning) in 60 days. I've had fleeting thoughts (which can be just as dangerous if held onto). But I combat these thoughts 3 ways: 
1.) I tell myself not to believe in the LIE that I can ever successfully use Kratom again. ""Once an addict, always an addict."" The addiction LIES to us to get us to use again. DON'T BELIEVE THE LIES!
2.) I remember how bad coming off of this stuff is... Especially the lack of sleep! I don't ever want to go through this again. I DON'T EVER WANT TO USE KRATOM AGAIN!
3.) I continue to read all of your folks stories and experiences on this subreddit. I see, on a daily, hourly, basis how rough some folks have it. Even rougher than me. I remind myself, it's all still out there waiting for me (again). I don't ever want to get ""too big for my britches"" so to speak. I must always remember where I came from. 

It's great to not be a green zombie any more. And I have you folks to thank for it.",19,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7166522}"

I’ve been off and on prednisone in rather high doses for parts of my life and I eventually began to like the energy and self esteeem I got from prednisone. I know too well how horrible prednisone is and finally tapered off for the last time. I started Kratom shortly after in search of that energy/cock-suredness I got from prednisone. I should mention I have auto-immune problems, hence the prednisone. So Kratom I heard would help, and it did, it even kept my colitis in check which was really great! More so than prednisone. The first few months were great, work went great, I wasn’t afraid to chat with new faces and meet new people. But like everyone else here, that all wore off, now, almost 2 years later, I take it to feel halfway normal, even though normal has become an emotionless zombie minus bouts of irritability or anxiety or depression, all Kratom induced I’m sure. I decided to try my old vyvanse meds again just as a means of having some type of energy to make it through work without Kratom. 

I manage a Buffett chain and work 10-12hr days. No one knows about Kratom besides my girlfriend, who hates it. I’m at the point now where I can get almost 24hrs and then I dose probably 5-7 grams and push for another 24. I plan to eventually get to the point where that dose is halved and finally just go without. I also need to mention I was roughly an oz a day user. Sometimes maybe only 20g sometimes closer to 35-40. I’m just ready to not look at my girlfriends sadness when she wants to make love and I can’t. 

I’m ready to feel motivated and excited again instead of going through motions. I never want to do anything hardly besides the gym, that’s been a lifelong habit of mine but even that isn’t as motivating as it used to be. I’m sick of being a zombie, thats the main jist, I’m emotionless or I’m irritable and frustrated. Never happy and upbeat. It’s my turn to quit. 

Thanks to everyone who posts about their experience. It gives me hope that I can just quit these morning doses in the next few days and ride this bitch out. Any encouragement and insight is welcomed please! Thanks guys",6,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4410097}"

2020-08-17 14:58:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ibkewo/for_real_this_time/,For Real This Time,"Hi everyone,

Been a lurker for a while, this is my first post in the community. I was on the green sludge consistently since late 2016/early 2017. I never took it for pain, really just took it to improve my mood and help me get motivated when I was feeling anxious or depressed. At first, this was the 'miracle plant' and I thought life couldn't get any better. What started as a fun thing to do a couple days a week eventually manifested itself into a daily habit. 

I was fortunate enough to self-regulate to the point where it never got truly out of hand. Most days I would only consume a few grams, but it still was practically every day I was taking it. Now I know my story pales in comparison to many others on here, but I want to make it clear that even at just a few gpd it was still VERY tempting and habit forming. There were many times when I felt I couldn't live without it. 

This blissful fog lasted a few years up and I never really felt that it was a problem - most likely my addict brain justifying the usage since it was ""only"" a few grams in the morning. Up until my birthday this May. I don't know what switched in my brain but my gut told me loud and clear I need to get away from this stuff. So on May 22nd, I quit! Or so I thought...

Quitting wasn't that bad considering I had been fortunate enough to keep my dosage relatively low, and I noticed many of the benefits people talk about on here (music sounding better, relationships improving, just an overall good feeling from not being dependent on this plant, etc.). But then...Covid happened. 

I caught Covid about a month into my quit. And for the first week I persevered and stayed true to my intentions. I am fairly young so having Covid was never too horrible - the worst symptom was extreme lethargy. I am a person who typically stays very active, and this tiredness was affecting me mentally as well as physically. Being confined in my house on the couch for a week unable to muster up the energy to do much really took its toll. And that toll I paid for with another bout of Kratom dependency. 

One day, fed up with the lack of energy and motivation, I justified taking ""just a little"" to kick start my productivity again. I swore I would never let it get out of hand, but day after day went by and ""just this one time"" turned into weeks and weeks of daily use. 

Now here I am on day 2 of my second round of quitting and I am FED UP with this plant. What did it for me this time was the digestive issues. Yes, even at low doses I experienced extreme constipation, and even GERD. Yuck.

So even though I relapsed I am set on making it through this time. The nice part is this time I know I can handle it having gone through 40 days kratom free before! I want everyone to know that even though my dose was kept relatively low, the temptation snuck up on me. We must be diligent. We must be persistent in this fight. We must focus on on the immense benefits of having our natural selves back. I am quitting for real this time and I urge you to join me.

Overall feeling better the worst part of it was going from 15gpd to around 5gpd.  All the classic opioid withdrawal symptoms.  RLS, sleep deprivation, cold sweats, anxiety, depression, lethargy, no motivation.  Also had GI cramps, muscle aches, runny nose.

Below 5gpd I still feel passing waves of anxiety, irritability, and depression.  Seems like lethargy, lack of motivation, brain fog still very much there just to a lesser degree.  I hope this won't last much longer than my taper.  I fear PAWS and the potential to create a situation for relapse the most.  

The good thing is my sleep has been much better and my libido is coming back slowly.  I can't wait to be rid of this junk, hopefully my life will return to normal with some time.  

Things that have helped me is a regular vitamin schedule.  

AM: B complex, vit C and D, L-tyrosine.

PM: magnesium, 5htp, melatonin, valrian root. 

Extra Vitamin C and L-tyrosine prn usually after lunch.

Anastrazole (prescription estrogen blocker) 2x a week to correct hormonal imbalances as a direct result of long term Kratom consumption.

Adrafinil: 2x a week prn for those days that I really need to get things done.  Trying to be careful with this as I don't want to trade one addiction for another.  

2mg nicotine lozenge PRN for a quick 15 min pick me up.  Not sure if this is helping or hurting.  

Coffee PRN for a pick me up.

I recommend a naturopath that understands opioid induced hormonal imbalances.  Kratom really did a number on my adrenal system, my androgen balance, and my Thyroid hormones.

I have been trying to quit kra for the last 6 months. I tried on my own, that didn't work out. I tried again and it didn't work either. I live with my girlfriend and I try to tell her everything, she can see and notice the changes anyway so might as well tell her. This time is going to be different. I have given all my kra to my girlfriend and we bought a safe, I know that I could just go buy more if things get really hard, but, I really want to get through this and move on in my life. I also don't want to go back on subs; was on subs for about 2 years after I totaled my car driving to get dark. I was having very bad cravings for dark after I got off of the subs, which led me to Kra, terrible decision on my part. Anyway, she is controlling my dose and I am tapering .5g every 4 days, been taking about 20 g per day. My girlfriend and I also scheduled me to see a drug counselor, hoping that is beneficial as well. Has anyone taken this approach? Any advice, comments or concerns would be greatly appreciated.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49832442}"

Digestion getting worse and worse,"I quit CT from about 7 to 12gpd a month ago. Before taking kratom I was already diagnosed with IBS. 7 months ago I've completely quit drinking alcohol which I had a real problem with but picked up kratom. It was nice not having to go all the time but i lost my sex drive and my hair began falling out, the constipation began to become an issue so i quit. The withdrawls sucked, im over almost all of them but the diarrhea is so bad since I stopped everyday, all day and night for 30 days now. The IBS has been an issue for 10+ years and I learned to somewhat manage it by cutting out dairy, red meat, eggs, soy, most vegetables, legumes, avoid fried and spicy foods, i even went gluten free for a few months but saw no improvement. Celiac test and food intolerance tests were negative according to my doctor which makes no sense to me since I cant eat most foods without getting sick. She told me there's nothing left I can do but try to manage it the same way I have been. Ive been taking a 50 billion probiotc daily supplement for years, i added another one called Digestive Advantage IBS Support thats supposed to be really great since i quit kratom but its not helping. I can't go anywhere or do anything, im always in a bad mood needing to run to the bathroom or lay down from the pain and ive been afraid to eat anything, but not eating makes everything worse in the long run. I have so much anxiety, I feel like im going insane and its embarrassing when im around anyone...The only medication I take is cannabis and its the only thing ive found that helps over the years, but since quitting Kratom NOTHING is working. Nothing. Its been years since I've felt this bad and im not gonna lie, my depression is back full force and suicidal thoughts have been creeping in more the worse this gets. I'm at a loss for where to turn or what to do, I can't even get my normal doctor to refer me to a gastroenterologist because the celiac and food intolerance tests were normal and im already doing everything she could suggest to treat my IBS. Not to mention it takes weeks to get any time over the phone even, let alone to see a doctor because of the COVID BS. I feel so hopeless.",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.88246953}"

But since Wednesday, I wake up every day now feeling refreshed. I have no more back pain, my body doesn’t feel on fire, my brain isn’t in a fog 24/7. The craziest thing is, I’m actually wayyy happier without it. I feel even and normal now. I did not anticipate this. I knew it would be worth it to finally stop Kratom, but I didn’t expect to feel this good without it. 

It’s hard to believe this information when you’re using like I did (30-40gpd for 5 years), but it’s true. The pain does stop, your brain WILL adapt, and best of all, you will believe in yourself again. You will trust yourself, you’ll take your life more seriously, and you’ll have a desire to really live and experience the world. 

Words cannot express how amazing it is to finally be on the other side of this bullshit. 

I’m not saying I’m perfect. I have a lot more anxiety, but that’s okay with me. I get depressed at times, but thats part of the process. What’s not okay is masking these problems with Kratom. It’s not the answer for me, and I promise it’s not for you. 

Please if you reading this, stick to your guns and get off of this shit. You will thank your future self so much. You might not feel good right now, but I promise you will. If you need to, get professional help and do whatever it takes to stop Kratom

2020-08-16 13:04:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/iavzyv/depressed/,Depressed,"I haven't posted here in a while and the main reason is my mental health has gone to hell  
I'm currently on the verge of relapsing because I feel I'm out of options  
My entire reason for quitting was for my health, I'd experienced a panic attack (I still assume that's what it was) from taking reckless amounts within a short period of time and ever since then (July 9th is when this happened) I've had shortness of breath  
I did notice over the last couple of months my daily activities consisted of me doing nothing but taking Kratom and watching videos on YouTube  
I have a girlfriend who I'm afraid of losing but when I talk to her I have nothing to say and don't have the energy to spend time with her  
It's not just her, I have nothing to say to anyone at all  
I'm depressed beyond belief and never imagined I'd feel it this severely again  
That terrifies me due to my past addictions and the state of mind it's put me in before, similar feelings I have now but this feels considerably more overwhelming and unbearable   
The last time I felt this way I'd attempted to take my life and nothing at that time mattered to me at all  
Nobody in my life was worth the continuous suffering I'd experienced on a daily basis  
But each time I've attempted to take my life a miracle happened and I'd wake up in the hospital or in time to save myself  
Not once have I wanted to end it all, it's just the last option I'd have to escape how I'm feeling  
Kratom has been my tourniquet   
And now that I've been over a month clean I feel I'm bleeding out  
I'm just not in the right state of mind to talk to anyone  
I keep getting told by relatives I look like I've seen a ghost and there is some truth in that  
I fantasize about taking my life off and on all day every day which is kinda like seeing a ghost  
I've tried to talk to my girlfriend about my mental state and she told me she can't handle the severity of what I'm going through, that I need to seek professional help  
I tried this  
I'd visited a doctor not too long ago and was prescribed Zoloft 50mg (I haven't taken it because I've had a bad experience with each and every anti-depressant I've tried in the past. Either it'll create physical symptoms that cripple me or it'll worsen my mental health. Lowering the doses and alternating medications never worked either, I'm positive I've tried Zoloft in the past and it worsened my mental health so I've avoided it.) I'd explained all my symptoms to my doctor including my shortness of breath and he summed everything up to being anxiety  
He told me I'd get a call from a specialist within the next 24 to 48 hours and I never heard anything  
I don't have insurance or anything so I've tried to avoid adding more to my medical debt, I'm already around 15k in medical debt  
And since I told everyone what the doctor told me, that it was my anxiety I've never been taken seriously since  
When I visited my doctor I knew better than to bring my up my mental health because in the past this has happened where all my physical symptoms are tied to my mental health  
It's like everyone brushes it off as if it's not a big deal and it's all in my head  
My girlfriend got frustrated the last time I had a mini break down over my health and I haven't talked about anything regarding it since  
I just isolated myself, told her I needed to be alone for a few days because I feel no more than a burden towards her now and haven't been able to talk to her since except telling her I'm sorry, that I love her and that I miss her every day  
I can't bring myself to talk to her about what I'm going through anymore  
I've never felt so alone and invalidated   
I thought I'd have support from everyone around me  
I've written suicide notes to each individual person I view as close in my life but I just ended up trashing them and trying to distract myself with something else  
I'd rather feel numb and somewhat functional than how I feel now  
I'm in my own personal hell   


I'm writing this here because I haven't had any way to open up with anyone in my life

I've only done this twice so far but feel accomplished nonetheless and it does help with the mental as it seems to give a mood boost especially after the cold shower. I'm sore as shit but overall feel better, it's a different kind of sore I guess from what I does to you in WD. Needing to take that next step down in gpd. I'm at 8grams 4 sometimes 5 times a day( hence the 32-40). Thinking of going down to 6gram doses to make it 24 - 30 gpd. Wondering if anyone knows of something I could do for some weight gain as with the exercise and still dosing, last thing I want is to lose more weight. I need to get back to 160+. I'm eating well but just curious as to anything else I might could do to help. Anyways, feel I've made a good start it in all this. Any support and/or info would be appreciated guys. STAY STRONG OUT THERE!!!

This is personal preference, but I can tolerate the discomfort of most the other effects (and/or I already have strategies to overcome them, like the sleep deprivation),  but I absolutely HATE that lethargic, tired, unmotivated, can’t-get-our-of-bed feeling more than anything in the world. I’m about to return to class on Monday—which is completely remote—and I’m super scared about my performance. 

I already drink a shit load of caffeine which is a hit or miss with the energy. Does anyone have any other recommendations to combatting this? I don’t need to be speed-wired or anything.

Started at 4gpd 8 months ago to help with alcohol addiction. Got down to 8gpd pretty quickly but then ramped back up to 12gpd. I have decided to go CT starting tomorrow. I did a 24hr challenge yesterday to just see what my body would do without for 24hrs. Made it to 25hrs and then dosed out of fear of what was to come. Decided to continue the taper starting today but this  tapering thing is just too hard for me. Not enough self control! I had ordered some Kratom to continue the taper and have just cancelled the order. I only have enough left to finish out today. Also considering throwing out my cigarettes too. Thoughts on this? Not sure if I should just get the suffering of both over with at once or take one thing at a time. Keep in mind I’m going to be doing this while working a full 40+hr work week. But it’s just got to be done. I HAVE to get me back and I don’t want to wait any longer. Needing all the support I can get from this group as NOBODY in my life knows about my Kratom use. That is were the self control becomes difficult with tapering. I hide my addictions SO WELL. Only a couple of people even know that I smoke cigarettes. Nobody knew I was addicted to alcohol either. Im an extremely high functioning addict! And surprisingly none of these addictions have yet affected my appearance which has also made them hard to quit. I’m 34 years old and am constantly mistaken to be 10years or more younger. All of this makes it so easy for me to continue using. But all of hiding and secrecy mixed with the addictions themselves make this a very lonely and self loathing life that I just cannot take anymore! I haven’t even tried dating in the last several years because this would allow someone to get close enough to me to know what my life really is. Okay, I’m just rambling at this point.

Hence my Kratom use to begin with. But I’m like way more hopeful now that chemicals are barely repairing their balance. I did ok only by trusting it would get better.

I was planning on quitting again this weekend but like a dummy I bought more yesterday. Well I woke up this morning feeling funny (not Kratom withdrawal funny). I took a pregnancy test and sure enough I’m pregnant but it’s very early on. I expected to get my period next weekend. 

I really thought it would take longer for me to get pregnant since it took me 6 months the first time and I’m over 35 now. I didn’t want to be pregnant and facing detox. 

My plan is to take as little as needed and be off completely off by next weekend. I realize it’s so early, there’s still a chance the pregnancy won’t stick and I could still get my period.

I went to see a doctor, and was given a urine test. I came up hot for Methadone and Methamphetamine. I DO NOT do either of these drugs. I rarely even take over the counter medicine. So, the urine was sent off to the lab. The results came back as having only Kratom in my system, (no meth or Methadone). I am on probation for one more month. I’m not sure if the Kratom created the false positives on the urine test, or if it was just a bad test. 
So, I decided to cold turkey quit my Kratom use. I’ve been using Kratom for 7 months. Taking 60 (at minimum) pills a day. 30 in the morning. Handfuls throughout the day and 30 at night. I don’t have time to taper off, or the willpower, as I know probation (DUI, my BAC was .391) is coming to an end and they will want one last urine test from me. I decided to quit Kratom because I don’t want any false positives, or any reason for my urine to be sent off to a lab by probation, and even if it was sent off....there would be no kratom found. I’m not sure if Kratom use is allowed while on probation. So, to be safe. I quit four days ago. I’ve had little symptoms of withdrawal. The first two nights I woke up and thought my heart was going to explode. My chest felt like it was on fire. Day one, I only had diarrhea twice. Slight headache these past four days. But Advil did the trick. A little anxiety, but I think it’s because my brain is confused. I’m trying to replace my time spent staring at the clock waiting to take kratom, with positive activities. My brain wants to keep thinking about kratom, but I refuse to let it!
I got the best advice from reddit users. Keep active. Keep moving. Exercise. Walk. Clean. Keep your mind busy with podcasts, music, tv, movies. Eat small but eat often. Keep hydrated. Take your vitamins. Do not sit around and dwell on your past kratom use, or the withdrawal. Keep looking forward to the goals you would like to achieve. 
I’m not sure how long kratom will stay in my system. But hopefully, when it’s out, I can feel back to my normal self. Once, I let a kratom pill sit on the sink and it got wet. I came back later that day, and the kratom pill expanded and it looked like there was a giant sludge turd sitting on the sink top. At first, I thought it was crap laying there. I can’t believe I was swallowing 30 pills at a time of that sludge. 
Anyways, I decided not to take the naltrexone. I think I’m doing just fine without it.

Once i get under 10g i really start to feel amazing. I just want to be off of this stuff. I’m 29 and feel like i missed out a lot of my 20’s due to drug abuse. Then turned to kratom and my life got much better, but then kratom became the demon even though it’s the lesser of the two evils.

I’m so much more social and happy when the kratom wears off. I see my potential and what i’m capable of, and know that kratom is preventing that. I want a good normal life, and to be able to find a partner that i can live life and go on adventures with. There’s so many life experiences i haven’t had yet that i want to experience.

Mentally i feel like i’m far ahead most people, because fighting addiction turns you into a buddhist monk in terms of mental strength and presence. But i feel like i’m still a teenager as far as life experience goes. It sucks sometimes that kratom takes away my ability to let my full self shine.

So when I read tapering stories, I always see higher dosages like 20g+ and long, precise tapering schedules. However, my daily usage is only 8g (or very rarely sometimes 10g) in just one dose a day.

That said, I have been using for over two years and by sheer luck have managed not go get up to such high doses (mostly because it's harder for me to afford).

I cold turkeyed a 3 year 10-15 gpd kratom habit about 4 months ago. Withdrawal sucked but getting my head back on straight was totally worth it. I finally felt like myself again for the first time in years. Best decision I’ve made since quitting heroin. 

Had some shit come up and in the heat of a terrible moment, I bought 30 gs of green powder. Whatever I was expecting, I was severely disappointed. My tolerance was super low, so I didn’t take much at a time, but I got nothing from it. Just headaches, nausea, maybe a tiny bit of the numbing effect, and the god awful depression that I’d completely forgotten about. It took me a week to finish all of the 30gs (I’d have finished it in a day or two before) and during that week I was that same miserable junked out person again - the one I worked so hard to get away from. I was so down I almost made plays to score some dope. I’m just glad to have made it through and hoping to never think that’s an ok thing to cave on again. Grateful to move on and not get stuck. 

TL:DR:  it still sucks, no withdrawals from a week of use but I got sucked into that piece of shit mindset so quickly. Not worth it.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7924475}"
2020-08-14 17:50:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/i9v525/there_is_finally_some_hope/,There is finally some hope,"Hi. I’m just posting this message to give hope for people out there that think they can’t quit this stuff. 

A little background.  I had a severe car accident and subsequent hip reconstruction.  Then I had a total right knee replacement.  So I had legitimate pain for a very long time. But now the pain is mostly gone and for over six months I haven’t had enough pain to justify taking anything other than Tylenol.  Yet I’ve still been taking anywhere from 60 to 80g a day.  Even as much as 100 on occasion.  Totally overboard, I know.  This has gone on for several years now and I built up to that tolerance.  I just did a fast taper and got down to 13g a day and leveled off there for a few days.  That’s right.  Went from 80g a day to 13 in about a week with minimal discomfort.  Maybe a little over a week.  My goal is to get to 0 in the next week or two.

For some time now, Kratom has caused undesirable side effects that I can no longer tolerate.  It killed my libido.  It gives me bad ED.  Causes extreme anxiety and depression.  Withdrawals after 6 hours of no Kratom.  It gives me the worst case of constipation I’ve ever had in my entire life. It affects my short-term memory. It made me lose my last relationship bc I couldn’t even have sex with my girlfriend anymore.  At the time, it seemed that it beat the alternative of taking Roxys to deal with my pain.  But it has turned into a problem in and of itself.  Kratom is sneaky bc it is all good and dandy at first. The destructiveness of Kratom pales in comparison to pain pills, alcohol and cocaine, so it fools you into thinking it’s good.  Until it’s too late and you realize it’s not so harmless.  It is an addiction and causes side effects that are seriously unpleasant. 

For people that are worried about tapering, it is definitely possible if you really want to come off. You have to want to do it though, because if you don’t want to do it and have a bag of the stuff sitting in front of you all the time you’re just going to relapse and pour a bunch of it down your throat.  At least that’s what I always used to do. 

Now, this time is different. I’m studying for the CPA exam and realized that kratom 100% definitely affects short-term memory and is affecting my studies.  Ever since I cut back I started retaining the material a little better.  Better but not perfect yet.  Hopefully when I’m completely off I’ll retain even more.  I need to pass this exam. My future depends on it. That’s my motivation.   I also want another relationship with a woman and it’s not going to happen while on this stuff because it totally kills libido.  

So I’m probably making the jump when I get down to 5g.  Hopefully within the next week or two. Maybe I’ll even taper all the way to 1-2g if I still get wd’s at 5g. If anyone is interested, I will keep you posted. 

WE DO HAVE HOPE.  I am a drug addict and was seriously addicted to this stuff.  If I can do it anybody can do it. Just want to tell people out there that it’s definitely possible, you just have to want it.  You have to find your motivation.  That’s the key.  

Good luck to you all.  Wish me luck as well please.  I’m cutting down to 11g tomorrow for a few days.  Then 9g a few days. 7, 6, 5...0.


Edit: yesterday 8/14 was 13g. Today 8/15 8g so far. Will allow myself 2g more for a total of 10g if i start feeling uncomfortable, but so far feel pretty good.  Keep in mind I used about 3oz a day for years.  Everyone can taper like this if I can.  Just do it!  👍🏼. We got this.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7840496}"

I’m prescribed amphetamine for attention problems which I assume was from kratom fog. I just took my last dose of kratom, aside from some stem and vein I have to even out over then next few days.  My wife, who hasn’t been supportive of my taper attempt or quit plan, just accused me of being abusive because of a seemingly minor disagreement, which lead to her repeating the ever growing list of things I’ve done over the years that she holds onto for ammo when she’s upset with me...)

Obviously if that’s true, and it may very well be that I’m emotionally destructive, I must take this opportunity to at least try to improve.  I might regret this but when I flushed my kratom l also flushed my amphetamines. I know it’s best in the long run, just wondering if anyone had experience CT with both substances at the same time, so I know what to expect. 


It breaks my heart that my wife says she thinks I’m abusive.  I’ve been in a verbally/mentally abusive relationship and while I’m inclined to disagree with her about how I treat her, I know I can be a better dad and husband so that’s why I’m here.

Yesterday I realized that exercise almost completely eliminates PAWS (for a short period). 

I also went to a dispensary and purchased a high quality CBD vape pen, which honestly didn’t seem to do much of anything. 

One think I noticed that helps is just doing ANYTHING, productive. Even just washing a dish or two, or sending a positive text to a loved one. 

Also some self care stuff like stretching or a facial mask for skin care. Taking kratom was about neglecting my body’s health so self care seems to be heading in the opposite direction.

I've tried CT but I found the fatigue and sleeplessness doesnt mix well at all with me. I work six days a week alone, 50 hours  in a fast paced work environment, I relied on K to push me through my worst days and for the ""mood boost"" Now I feel stuck using it just to sleep and work. My job is very demanding physically and I still rely on K to pull me through 800 days  later. God has it really been that long, every single day chugging this bullshit?

This last week I managed to taper down a small bit to 13 GPD  but the insomnia and mood swings are very bad from just that small reduction. I dont know how others on here just jump off cold turkey while facing life head on. As a fellow addict You have my utmost respect being that strong. I cant seem to summon the willpower to do the same.


 I thought this would be quick and easy but its absolutely not. My body is completely saturated to the core with kratom alkaloids after 2 years daily. My body screams at me to use it to continue on like its food and water when in reality I know its poison. It no longer ""works"" like the way it did in the beginning, those days are long gone. It is now a poison, killing my sex drive and blunting my emotions.
Without K running through my veins, I am emotionally miserable and low energy. Its infuriating and I'm slowly preparing myself to eventually make the jump. I want break these chains and be proud of it. I know it's possible with time.

 I use a scale religiously and dose in half leveled teaspoons just to take the edge off. I've taken approximately 21 grams in the last 38 hours. Last week it was 30g in 48 hours. Slowly and carefully reducing my long term dependency on this plant.

I can not go cold turkey. 

I had very bad paws and realised I needed some serious stimulation. I needed a big change in my very 
boring life .
 So I rented out my house packed my bags and headed off to Asia. It was a great move for me. Walking in the Himalayas.  Riding my motorcycle. Fishing. Making friends. The whole 9 yards. 
I changed my life around and for the last 2 years my life had become much better. I still sufer from depression and anxiety but I can manage just fine as long as I exercise eat well socialize and engage with life.  

I came back to the UK in March feeling a little anxious but knowing I was was heading back to the Himalayas in 3 weeks. I call it home now. I feel at peace when I am there. 

And then Covid struck meaning I was stuck here in the UK.  I was ok to begin with but I soon started to feel depressed not knowing when I would be able to return to my life in Asia. 

Kratom had not entered my mind for 3 years and then one day a friend of mine mentioned that I was once addicted to kratom. As soon as he said it I thought a little kratom would help motivate me .
Well it did that alright but here I am again addicted to kratom. 

The good news it's only a small 5 gram a day habit. I dose twice a day but it's going up slowly and even now I'm not getting the desired effect.  Its also only been 2 months of consuming.  It's the first thing I think of in the morning. 
 Kratom has got it's claws into me once again. 

I know what I have to do. I know I will have to taper down but I also know that my depression and lack of motivation will be difficult to deal with. I've quit before so I can quit again.

It keeps the hot/cold sweats manageable, which is my most miserable symptom (besides the RLS). 

This RLS and anhedonia though..nothing seems to be helping. I refuse to go back to taking kratom regularly, have promised myself I wouldn’t, but is there anything that is proven effective other than just riding it out? My legs are so achy, heavy, and restless, and the anhedonia and depression is making me feel just hopeless, like I have nothing to live for. I have friends and relatives asking me why I’m not answering their calls, my kids wondering why I’m just laying around, and that makes me feel even worse. I don’t even want to eat. It’s late afternoon and I haven’t eaten anything. 

I’ve dealt with a lifelong struggle with depression and anxiety, which, after going off antidepressants in 2012, I ended up self medicating for (first with prescription pain pills, which I used to the Kratom to get off of, now here I am), so it’s no surprise it’s trying to creep it’s way back in.

We lived 4 hours apart until July 4th when he moved with me. I knew about the use still but I had no idea how bad until he moved. Before he was randomly buying any capsules he could, taking as many as he wanted whenever he felt like it. ( I found that out last week)He told me he wanted help to stop so I researched what I could and figured the powder is cheaper and we can measure it out and slowly taper it off. He got a job as a mechanic and I thought he was taking 2g 2x a day, am and evening. Come to find out he had a stash he was taking while at work and not measuring it out and last week shit just hit the fan. We both have battled much bigger addictions so I didnt understand why this had such a hold on him. He finally broke down, admitted its no good, and that he's taking way to much, and was super disappointed in himself for becoming dependant on a substance again. I have watched it slowly suck the life out of him and I want my bf back! So after a few rough days of trying to figure out a schedule and dosage that works without making him sick was such a freaking challenge but since Sunday he has been taking the same amount, 4g 3x a day and it so far has been manageable. I had to stash caps in the car bc i was terrified he would get sick at his new job but thankfully he didn't need them. So our plan is starting tomorrow his am dose will not change, but we will taper to 3.5 for the second two and over the weekend make all 3 doses 3.5 since he will be home in case he gets sick. The plan is do that again until Thursday and keep going down .5 every week. We are both terrified of him getting sick at work, and dont want to drag this out but also want to be done. Does that taper method sound alright? I know everyone is different but I'm trying to learn as much as I can about this green crap because I want to help any way that I can. I lost him to drugs and prison 6 years ago and I refuse to let this gas station bullshit take him away from me again! Especially bc in the last two years he has come so far and was completely sober until this shit came along. Its slowly taking over and I know he sees that and I know that he wants to stop for not only me but himself too. If you got this far thank you :)",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53679204}"
2020-08-13 15:49:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/i96vxe/no_more/,NO MORE,"Hey guys, been reading these threads for over a month now. Posted once, not saying much at all, but I feel it is time to get real with myself. I am currently taking about 30 to 40 gpd for close to a year now, before that was a much smaller amount and have stopped K twice during those smaller gpd periods( about 10 to 15 gpd I'd say) with no truly hard consequences. But of coarse with this last year rising up to 40 gpd I'm already feeling the pains without really trying to do nothing more than feel somewhat normal. It is seriously time to stop this madness of literal self destruction in mind and body. I'm six foot and weigh 148 currently (I've never weighed more than 170 sober but still) and its noticeable, not terrible but noticable, I can see myself aging in the face dramatically faster(I'm 45 years old btw) with what seems to me to be some slight cheek discoloration only noticeable by me thus far but I can see it, I know K is why, I've never in my life been so emotional, depressed, had anxiety, or been so angry all the time and it scares me, I mean like I try to control it and I just cant seem to. I'm currently taking on so many things new in my life that the timing of all this is horrible. I've been in a new relationship with the absolute most Beautiful woman inside and out that I've ever known in my life, she is so damn genuine and caring it's mindblowing to me. She does not know about my problem(beyond words, yes I am ashamed of myself). One can imagine the lengths I have to go to keep it hidden, it is so fucking shameful and deceitful. She sees all these issues that Kratom has caused in me and loves me beyond anything I've ever known thru them and considering what this sludge does to most of us at the point I'm at, to some extent I do control my issues due to Kratom to an extent.  Thing is, she has 3 pretty unruly boys to say the least, not their fault, not been shown by their father how to respect. 13, 11 and 5. So I'm sure some of you can imagine what comes along with taking on a pretty new relationship with 3 young boys in the middle of fixing to try to tackle this thing that should not be(Kratom of coarse). As well, I'm fixing to start a new job within the next two weeks. I'm reaching out for suggestions to a taper (whether slow or fast) and anything else that may help with the WD. Just needing as much info as possible. Also I'd love to know a timeline on how and what things improved be it weight gained back, appearance, libido, temperament, things to look forward to ya know. I've been dosing close to 10 grams 4 times a day(some days more) and wake up some mornings in WD already. No real problems sleeping tho. Really wanting some help, encouragement and to be held accountable and feel these threads may do just that. I'm extremely thankful for this being here. Never truly been this addicted to anything before but this crap has a hold of me in mind like nothing I've ever experienced. I appreciate in advance any time and consideration any of you guys puts toward this issue with/for me. I know I've got to do this, I've just got to, it is consuming me and trying to rob from me(her) the best thing that has ever happened to me. I CAN NOT LET THIS SHIT WIN. (I know some will say it, I need to tell her, I just can't, the fear and possibility of losing her is to big, at this point in my life I don't know that I'd vsurvive it, I know how weak that sounds, but its truth. Truth is what I've seen here thus far so that's what I'm giving back. It's only right to do so. I am so fucking ashamed of this. Tears rolling as I text this. This shit is so life killing, it truly is a damn trap, she deserves so much more than this me that's not even fucking me). Please help. Any and all would be more than incredibly appreciated please.....please no judgement please...I'm beating myself to a pulp more than anyone else ever could. I've got four boys myself (grown btw)that my relationship has gone downward with since the use of this crap. Not terrible but downward nonetheless. I'm sure there are several points I missed on this, side effects ect but I know that yall know.....",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5519647}"

**The Last 2 Weeks**

I've made a couple of posts over the last week about my kratom usage and want to share my experience after being off entirely over the last few days. I had been taking kratom daily for 2.5 months - worked my way up from 3 gpd to 16 gpd (was at this dose less than 2 weeks ago). My taper strategy was rapid, as I quickly realized how things were getting out of hand and didn't want to continue spiraling and increasing my dose; in \~10 days I went from 16 gpd to 0. It wasn't bad until I got down to 4 gpd - this is when I experienced anxiety, depression, lethargy, and all the other fun symptoms you read about on here. **Sunday 8/9 was one of the worst days of my life.** Chronic anxiety, deep sadness, horrible thoughts racing through my mind, night sweats, insomnia, stayed in bed all day, crying, I truly hated myself. I've read so many people say that days 3-7 are the worst, and that's been my experience as well.

**Going Forward**

After Sunday, everyday has been significantly better than the days before. I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders, my thoughts are clear, I feel extremely driven, exercise, meditate, have tons of energy, sleep better, reconnecting with friends, libido back in overdrive..I feel like a human again instead of a zombie. I hated the powder, so I recently bought 1,000 caps that I was using during the taper (only used \~50-60). As of now, I have a couple of kilos of the powder and a bunch of pills. I'll be disposing of everything today.

**Thank You**

I am extremely grateful to everyone in this community for posting, encouraging, and sympathizing with everyone who's trying to quit. Admitting that you are addicted to something isn't easy, but it's easy to feel shame, guilt, and helplessness while you're going through it. Because of this community, I told a few of my best friends and they were extremely supportive, let me vent, and listened. To anyone who is thinking of quitting, I highly suggest doing so. Kratom is so dangerous because of how insidious it is: you can buy it at liquor stores, smoke shops, convenience stores, and at first it's nice, takes the edge off, and gives you a buzz, until you need to increase the dose again, and again, and again, until eventually you're a shell of your former self and life is grey instead of colorful. Your withdrawal symptoms will vary, one day you'll be feeling incredible, the next day will be shitty, the following day you'll bounce back. Up and down, down and up, until you're over the hump and then things will slowly improve until you're back to your real self.",10,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.41326186}"

I got off suboxone like 18 months ago, ended up hospitalized from wd. I started taking kratom about 20 days off subs and have basically been on it ever since. I'll suffer through the acute withdrawal, make it 4 days, 6 days, one time made it like 18 days. I'm fucking done. Part of me has just accepted that I'm a late stage drug addict and the best outcome for me is managing my use carefully as possible, but another part of me is just really fed up with my life rotating around kratom or whatever else I'm taking. Anyways, I feel like shit and know I will for awhile - I'm seasoned enough to know there is no way around the suffering. I suffer on the kratom anyways, so what's the fucking difference?  I guess I don't like to feel anything, which is why I take kratom. I've got stuff to live for, I'm not caving this time. It's nice to find a place where people are honest about kratom, pretty much every social media page is people saying it's a harmless, magic plant and discredit you when you bring up the brutal addition it causes.

There were some posts about this a long time ago, and I figured now would be a good time to bring this up again to see if anyone has experienced anything similar, or if any of the original posters can provide us with some updates.

I saw a rheumatologist and was diagnosed with Central Pain Syndrome. I don't know if I agree with it because he said it can be caused by stress, whereas literally everything I've read about it says that it's caused by CNS damage or dysfunction, but can be exacerbated by stress. I'm currently tapering to see if Kratom use is related to these issues.

Before cutting back, my daily dose was between 25g and 30g of a red vein. As described in my recent posts to this forum, I have been tapering down by dividing the day's total into four daily doses. Currently, I'm at 1.6 (waking) 1.6 (noon) 1.6 (early evening) 1.6 (before bed) for a total of 6.4g per day. I am also taking one B6 pill and one Tyrosine 500mg pill in the morning for energy, one magnesium citrate pill in the morning, one 50mg 5-HTP in the evening, and one magnesisum citrate pill in the evening. I'm also trying to do cardio every day to wear my legs and arms out. Oh yes - and 6g of melatonin.

In a previous post, I mentioned that I was experiencing aching muscles and pains and slight withdrawal symptoms. Several people suggested that I could get around this by holding at the same dose for a few days so my system could adapt before dropping. I reworked the taper schedule, and have been sticking to it, but the revised schedule will extend my taper for another eight weeks. 

The withdrawals have been up and down. On Tuesday evening, the second day after a drop, I experienced serious insomnia. Woke up in the middle of the night at around 2:00 a.m. and couldn't go back to sleep at all. Last night was a bit easier because I was already exhausted. Also, I had spaced out the doses so I had a bit more unconsumed kratom as I headed into the evening. When I woke up twice in the middle of the night, I was able to take half a dose each time without exceeding my overall daily limit. This worked somewhat and my watch claims that I slept for six hours last night. 

My wife knows what's going on, and my insomnia makes it difficult for her to sleep, so she wisely wondered if it might be better to just go cold turkey. I'm not sure about what to do, and have a few questions for more experienced quitters in this group: 

* **Is the slow taper going to make the final jump easier, or am I just delaying the inevitable?** 
* I've noticed **different symptoms manifesting at each set point.** One time it was light RLS. Another time, it was aching lower back pain. Most recently, it was insomnia. I'm probably grasping at straws here, but am wondering if I'm 'working through these symtpoms' and knocking them off the list by tapering. For example, since the light RLS did not come back the last two times, does that mean it's unlikely to be a major side effect when I jump? (I'm guessing the answer is ""No. It doesn't work that way,"" but it's worth asking!) 
* **Has anyone jumped at around 6g per day?** I'm getting really close to this level and am contemplating going cold turkey next week. 
* **Why do withdrawal symptoms tend to kick in on the second or third day after a drop?** Is this related to half-life or something?

i guess i’m writing to say, at what point do i just feel normal?

Been taking Kratom for 2ish years now somewhere between 60-100 gpd. Large range cuz I just used a spoon from the kitchen to measure out heaps 2-3x a day from my kilo of powder. Finally quit because I’d end up throwing up from taking to much 1-2x a month. Within about the last month I took too much to the point I tried for 30 sec to get up off the couch only to be able to roll off crawl 10 feet to a trash can not make it and throw up all over the floor. Last time I woke my mom up and she went through my backpack and is demanding I stop CT. I’ve ran out several times and have had w/d s before one time being up the entire night not being able to lay still for more than 5 seconds. My brothers going to help me ween off because I can’t talk to my mom about it and I won’t quit CT. I’ve felt depressed the last 5 years and Kratom fixed me. I could take it at night and then be able to just sit up and get up when I wake up the next day. Well now here I am I hope when I quit I’m not back in the same situation before I started. Never saw anyone for help with depression idk why it’s just something I never was able to bring myself to do before I scheduled a doctors appointment and got referred to a psychiatrist for opiate and alcohol wd s. I saw suggestions for making an appointment and being open and honest with your physician and ask about Valium along with several other supplements to help with the wd. So that’s my story I just made a reddit account because of this group.

Anyways my question is say im weening off down to say 5gpd and I slip end up deciding to chase the high one time and take say 15grams at once. Does that completely reset all the work I’ve put into the taper? Or can you finish chugging along the next day at 5gpd again without restarting? Thanks. I know it’s not the right mindset but I’m curious and want to know what to do if I slip.

I have been feeling pretty crappy lately and I can't figure out why. Chicken or the egg sort of thing? Am I taking Kratom to help feel better or do I feel like crap because of the Kratom. Feeling very fatigued, tired, groggy. Caffeine hasn't done the trick so I have been adding Kratom. I used to feel more energy with just a few grams, but now it would take spacing it out (so I don't get sick) and half the day until maybe I felt some energy.

Either way, tomorrow is day 1- I am not taking it anymore for sure. I know that I feel better without any ""foreign"" substances. I've stopped drinking, stopped meds. So time to stop this too. Maybe caffeine will be next but lets not get ahead of myself here :)

So any thoughts on the above or just advice for getting me through the next days of what most likely be more tiredness. (I read the side bars!) My plan is to just try to get to bed at a good time everyday, drink lots of water, and force myself for some level of exercise. I just need to be able to focus to get through my demanding job. Thanks!

I have quit numerous times, but this was for sure my worst first day of quitting ever. Lol I know it is sad to say. I just would like to put my day down on paper. I woke up and was BATTLING getting kratom. No energy to do anything, not even go to the grocery by anxiety was so bad I just went on a long aimless drive which helped miniscually. My sex drive is coming back to an unhealthy level. Sorry to get graphic but I masturbated 5 time in a few hours. Sat there in between a useless emotional wreck and then eventually took a nap at 2 PM. This always happens to me when I quit, I always need naps. I dragged myself to the grocery store and cooked dinner, my partner came home and yelled at me for my lack of focus and motivation and how I'm not doing shit. Now I am in a separate room from them listening to the Cure and crying. I feel broken and dysfunctional and am not interested in anything. IDK what the future will hold with this relationship of 5 years, and I am kind of freaking out because my previous source of income (job) has basically been made obsolete and unemployment is gone. Me and my partner have been trying to start a business and ot is kind of falling apart. Please help guys, I truly feel like I am headed for doomsday scenarios. Am I broken?

After quitting I had been very very tired & completely unmotivated to do so many things for weeks. On a whim I went to my local head shop & bought 3 ounces then after I ran out I went back & bought 5 more ounces. I am too ashamed to tell my son & boyfriend. So now I am hiding it from them which is horrible. I am at least making a conscious decision to try to use less than I was before, but I have failed at even that several times. Im at a loss right now on what to do. 

I am also smoking reusable vape pens which are more expensive than cigarettes because I smoke much more frequently since I don't have to go outside. The only saving grace is that I have not relapsed again with alchohol.
 
I feel really bad about myself & I feel weak, I feel like a failure. I can't afford to go back to kratom again finically, physically or spiritually. I know I have to take the rest of my kratom & divide it up & try to do another taper.

Maybe there's nothing wrong with me its just who i am AND i have to be prepared to receive those thoughts without reacting...and what i'm in a WORSE spot and like...i'm at the gas station? Just wanted you guys to maybe prepare yourselves the same way. Its been more than 2 months and in about 50 days i have thought about Kratom once. Id call that a win. Love y'all. And please don't stop trying. Again...i did nothing special and i swear to you i have no other special skills that you don't have and i'm not mentally stronger or anything whack. I don't have more willingness to do this and i don't have more discipline than you either. I didn't stop trying and i found whatever worked for me. I don't even know what did.

I am beating myself up enough for all of us, trust me. I'm 32 weeks pregnant, I have a scheduled c section in 7 weeks. My husband and I have been taking kratom for about 7 months now. Well I have, he quit about a month ago. (Yep, we conceived our 4th child less than a week after starting kratom and getting off opiods, which was why we started it in the first place) 
After I found out I was pregnant, I initially freaked out and wanted to quit right then and there. Because I was freaking out i searched Facebook groups and ran across a group just for pregnant moms taking kratom. It put me at ease because many of these women were continuing their kratom use throughout their pregnancies. Most of them said everything went fine and a few of them had bad experiences. Well, I wish I would have never found that group and quit right away. Here I am 7 months later feeling so stuck. Over the past month i have tried to quit numerous times and failed. At first i went 2 days and, and then a week. After that week I got so tired of being completely exhausted, I couldn't take it anymore. I caved. Now I've only been able to make it a day or two and then I cave again. Everytime, I have found myself so insanely exhausted, I just simply dont want to get out of bed, or I want to just sit there for 12 hours. We have 3 other children and that's just simply not possible for me to do and so I cave.  I cant take any supplements, or very minimal atleast. I just feel stuck, I am terrified that my sweet little boy is being harmed. Never  have I ever done anything while pregnant with my children. A little bit of coffee and that's it. But with this poor boy I have been taking kratom the entire time and because of the kratom I have also not been able to quit smoking cigarettes. I feel like the biggest piece of a s*** mother on the face of the earth. I want so badly to quit and the first couple of tries, I had the motivation. But now after failing so many times, I feel stuck, like I cant do it. I am running out of time. I dont have time to wean down now. The past month my use has been so sporadic, I'm not even sure how much I'm taking because we threw the scale away a month ago and have just been getting 1oz bags at a time. I'll finish that and then say that's it I'm done and then go a day or 2 and end up getting another and starting the cycle all overagain. I dont know what to do. I just feel so stuck and so awful.

I've tried gaining confidence and motivation from this group for some time, and it usually works, but ten minutes later as it fades so does my confidence. I've recently started a taper that has been going well thus far. There is an absolutely zero percent chance i wouldve gone through with this without this group...so thank you.

As a brief background, i have a HEAVY history of serious, hard drug addiction - opiates are my DOC. Rehabs, relapses, the whole nine. 4 Years ago i got sober, turned my life around. Things have been great (still are mostly). Last Nov i got some serious oral surgery done, and complications pushed me into the worst pain ive ever experienced. I of course knew that PKs werent optional with my history, so i opted to settle for Kratom. I will tell people that i am surprised with the outcome of that decsision, but truthfully im not. Im a hard core addict, i knew exactly what i was getting into. I had used kratom a number of times in the past to help ease drug wd. Anything that almost completely eliminates hard drug wd is a DRUG, there is no substitution. 

It started casually enough, capsules only, 10 gpd - this lasted maybe 4/5 months. Since the onset of covid it started to take off. Moved to powder, have been using upwards of 30/35 gpd for the past 3/4 months. I've read everything on here re tapering and assistance and have followed that. Moving to capsules again really helps with the taper - i would not be able to maintain discipline with powder.

I dont want to quit because my life went to shit again, or because of the money. My life is still pretty great, and the money is only a small contributing factor. There is a certain, unparalleled freedom that comes with sobriety; the ability to travel without the chains of addiction holding you back. Imagine going anywhere you want, at any time, and the first thought not being how to plan your kratom supply, or how much you need to bring, or how youll consume it, or when. It is so liberating - and that is a feeling i miss. I am hoping, with the help of the group, that i will be able to get back there soon enough.

I have posted multiple times on this subreddit in the past few years in the hopes of getting off of Kratom. I’ve failed at least a dozen times or more. But this time, I got it right. 

I didn’t post throughout the time because (here comes the controversy) I took suboxone for a 3 week taper to stop Kratom. It worked for me and now I’m clean off of both. Suboxone did not entirely take away my withdrawals, but it became more bearable. I never took more than what was needed and I pushed myself to get off of it as quickly as possible. 

Anyway, I am now at Day 32 of No Kratom! If you told me that I’d be a month clean 2 months ago, I would have not even come close to believing it. I thought it was literally impossible for me to do this. I’m so grateful I finally did what I said I’d do. 

Granted, I’m definitely going through PAWS and it’s a bitch, but it’s doable. I feel depersonalized from the world in some ways, depressed, but i get a little better everyday. If I’m getting 5% better everyday, it won’t take too long before I’m back to who I was.

I was using it one year very frequently, almost daily, I didn't have any significant WDs the days 1-3, but since day 4th and today, I have bad depression, RLS, terrible anxiety and can't sleep at night. When does it get better ?

I am not epileptic, I had my first grand mal seizure 6 days ago, but I am not sure if I have to blame it on Kratom, but at least partially it's kratom fault :

I was using Xanax for about a month or so, almost daily (around 1,5mg - 3mg) and stopped it CT. 3 days later I get a seizure :

\- I took Kratom (must be around 4-5g)  2pm that day.

\- At around 6:30pm I ingest 250mg of Tramadol as Kratom didn't have any effect due to tolerance. I also took some Lyrica 150mg for its anticonvulsive action but apparently it did the opposite.

\- Also acompanied by hydroxyzine for nausea, 37mg at 2pm, then 25mg more along with Tramadol.

\- At 8:30pm I get a seizure and paramedics take me to hospital. Did every single test and everything came back normal. I had 38C/100.4F fever and it wasn't covid after testing. Now I am highly suspicious it was serotonin syndrome that caused the seizure, because of the fever and nausea.

\- Kratom inhibits CYP2D6, thus it didn't let Tramadol metabolize into O-DSMT, leaving it as a strong SNRI in the blood with no opioid activity, along with the pre-conversion GABA-A inhibitory action, lowering even further the already depleted gaba levels. Wish I knew this earlier.

I believe the whole combo (Xanax WD, Kratom, Tramadol, Lyrica and Hydroxizine) is responsible for the seizure, rather than Kratom alone.  Also, Pregabalin with its serotonergic action has a liability to cause serotonin syndrome. In fact, every drug mentioned in the combo had serotonergic activity, including Hydroxizine (5-HT2A).

What do you think ? I wish at least I could slowly tapper. I was taking Kratom for depression, and the rebound depression I get is horrific. My neurologist refused to prescribe me at least Diazepam to ease Xanax WDs and help taper, and couldn't find any doctor willing to prescribe me benzos. I rarely drink alcohol, but had to do today as I feel my stomach being so tight because of the anxiety and depression.

I manage to barely sleep every night using 3-7mg of Mirtazapine (Remeron).

PS I am not new in any of the mention substances. In fact, I had been using Tramadol way before finding about kratom, and sometimes have used 400mg of Tramadol followed a couple of hours later by Kratom with no issues.",5,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59593815}"

I have cold sweats and depression. I'm prescribed xanax so it helps a little but only for anxiety. I started going to the gym to run and work out hoping it would help but no luck so far. Every night i take melatonin and ""restful legs"" to help with RLS, except it doesnt. If im lucky i get 2 hours of sleep. Its horrible.

Vigilance and Commitment: I've decided to work on one thing per day to ensure my recovery from Kratom. I don't want to have just quit... I want to stay quit. **Today I choose to work on my negative thoughts and negative thinking patterns.** When a negative thought occurs, I will do my utmost to a.) recognize it as such, a negative thought... and b.) replace it will a positive thought. Example: ""I am so sick and tired of this daily back pain!"" ... ""But at least it's not as bad as my last several months of using. Remember the time it took you a half hour to get out of bed just to use the bathroom? It hasn't been *that* bad since you quit. My back is getting better and I'm not hooked on a substance any more!""

**That's mine for today: working on replacing those negative thoughts.** I can't stop the thoughts from occurring, but I can replace them with positive thoughts before I take actions based on the negative. Negative thoughts lead to negative actions (like using Kratom again). Positive thoughts lead to positive actions.

Its day 5 with no kratom and I can finally say hell naw I'm never going back and here's why. 

I've been on kratom for two or three years I cant even tell you atm because I'm freaking burnt from this shit, I dont even want to try to remember.  The last year has been bonkers on the kratom, I took a big mental spiral downward, spiritual, and cognitively. 

I started making the bad decisions that come along with a broken spirit due to drug use. I've been self medicating for 13 years, done all the drugs with some mild addictions in that time frame. Nothings screwed me as bad as kratom and I've done it all. 

I took/abused adderall to combat the wds at work and basically had a mental break down and fled my job and life basically. 

4 months later I had the courage to get another job. Today is my second day on the job and I feel so dumb with the brain fog. Things got intense when I was surrounded by a bunch of high school kids and I realized that I'm at where I'm at because of drug abuse. I'm 32 yrs old. I wanted to go get some kratom so bad to escape this reality but I knew that this day is the FUCKING day I never go back! I've given in to the temptation for the last 2 years everytime. I'm finally ready to get some professional help.

That was back in 2016. At that time I ran an improv troup and was a stand up comic Magician. I felt like I needed some sort of boost to be a better entertainer. 

I quickly fell into all the kratom hype of it being a wonder drug to help me with my self doubt. I needed it to preform. I had a worsening abusive family situation. That gave me the excuse. Now in my head I had permission to take this daily. Daily quickly changed to multiple times a day. Quickly after that my personality slipped away and i started to become a shell of my former self. I was slowy being stripped of my personality and felt the days blending together. I never blammed the kratom. It HAD to be something else. 

Even though I was doing so poorly I shared kratom like the Gospel. My girlfriend had anxiety so I prescribed kratom. My friend had a bad day I told him to take kratom. If someone stubbed a fucking toe id give them some. My girlfriends parents found out about it and where not happy. All the tension that caused ended the relationship. Thoose friends I mentioned, they where taking kratom daily too now. Then they went on to telling all there friends. Its almost like a kratom pyramid scheme. To this day I feel personally responsible for like 8 peoples on going addictions. As for me daily use without any questions continued for close to a year. 

Im not sure how it happened but one day I realized kratom was causing most my physical and mental issues. I started freaking out that i felt i had lost the person i was. I didnt feel happy at all anymore. Not to mention kratom made me have fits of rage that pushed friends away. On top of that I lost a girl I loved so much.  I tried to go cold Turkey then fucked up then repate. I'd go through multi month yoyo tapers to no effect. I felt helpless.

 Then that girl who left me ended up comming back into my life. She made me promise no more kratom. I lied. I covered up a daily addiction. Id make up elaborate excuses and stories. I felt so ashamed. On top of that because i was so depersonalized i felt my personality simply wasn't enough. My addiction and lies continued for a few more years. Over that time my self hate grew and grew. Through that time i  had multiple quit attempts to no success. 

I dont know what did it but one day I started to successfully taper. I felt like everytime i lowered my dose i became more and more myself. It eventually came time for my last dose. As silly as it sounds i poured the last ounce into my hands and through it in the air like lebron James.

Backstory : When we first started dating, he told me about his kratom use and I was pretty upfront with my feelings about it. I didn't think substance use was an appropriate way to deal with his issues and that it would impact our relationship at some point. He broke down, quit the next day, and went through some gnarly withdrawals. 

Well this past weekend I discovered kratom in our apartment and confronted him about it. That's when he confessed to hiding it for over a year. I was heartbroken. And even worse, he is refusing to accept it as a problem. He says it's helping with his anxiety and making him feel better and just completely ignoring his addictive tendencies. I feel like I'm at a total breaking point, and even though we are going to therapy, I can't imagine this getting resolved unless he is able to admit it's a problem. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice from anyone who dealt with this with their partner/friend/family member, or even if you have struggled with it yourself.

PAWS I hear is a bitch and the ongoing low mood and no energy is probably the worst part of it.  It started at 1 or 2 doses a week that slowly grew to everyday.    

It was great at the beginning and If I were writing this a year in I would probably be ripping this sub reddit a new asshole.  It really did help me get through some uncomfortable times in my life.  At about 2 years I realized it was ruining my life, I felt like a zombie on it, doses were increasing due to tolerance.  I was up to around 15 GPD split in 3 doses sometimes extra on special occasions.  Over time, I felt that nothing in life was exciting and nothing in life made me happy or was worth doing.

Not sure how much I took, but it was a substantial amount with big spoonfuls. I ran out and was waiting for some in the mail, which is when my WD started. Honestly so grateful for being pushed into it, because it forced me to confront how toxic this was for me. I wanted to update you guys. After that first painful week, I dropped off and mostly lurked here and there. I found that for myself, it was best to step away otherwise I’d be consumed by the anxiety and discomfort.

I’m glad went CT, because the shock to my body and mind made me really realize how God awful this stuff is for me. I wrote some quick notes for myself after seeing others recommended writing down the bad parts to remind ourselves later why we wouldn’t use again. It’s choppy because that’s how miserable I felt:

Skin is crawling. Pins and needles. So thirsty. Can’t stop peeing. Waves of chills down my body. Dark, swollen puffy circles around my eyes and cheeks I’ve only seen with quinsy. Eyes feel hot. Weird breath smell. Sweaty hands and feet but feel cold. Exhausted, on the verge of sleep, like I so rarely am but heart is pounding. Myalgia through my legs. Heavy pain like I’ve walked for miles. Painful knees, toe joints, ankles.

&#x200B;

That first week SUCKED. Not gonna lie. But man, after this I have so much respect for myself and all of you! Sure, some people taper or use medications to ease into this, and I would too if I could. But no matter what, this shit is hard, and we should all be proud of ourselves. I had beta blockers, hydroxyzine, high quality chelated magnesium taken regularly for years, l-theanine, and taurine, but can’t say they did a whole lot for me.

I posted asking about a strange odor that was coming off my breath and nose and read someone mention the Herxheimer Reaction. Still don’t really understand it, but it has something to do with yeast/microbes dying off, and it could explain the weird yeasty, beer smell as that’s all I could compare it to. Also I used to struggle with bad fungal acne the last few months (hormones, inflammation, suspected kratom but was in denial). That has also substantially improved, which would make sense. Hopefully if you are dealing with this, this post can calm your concerns. Within like 2 days, my skin had a glow before getting kinda bad again. I figure it’ll take some time and being able to sleep to get back to a good place.

I was also shedding badly during this time but never noticed shedding during using kratom. That scared me (especially after having struggled with hair loss for medical reasons), but it seems to have leveled out. Tbh I cut my hair into a short bob (never cared much for long hair anyway) so I wouldn’t have to see long hairs everywhere.

Another weird this was that my body had a weird, false period? My cycle never stopped with kratom, luckily, but a couple days into quitting, I started. It wasn’t a real period, and I wasn’t due to have one yet. It was like weird “breakthrough bleeding” I think it’s called sometimes? Spotting? Idk, kinda freaked me out, but that’s since subsided. Y’all my body obviously fucking hated this poison to do all of this upon quitting.

I will be honest and say I struggle so much with being bored, fatigued. That was why I started kratom. I have ADHD, anxiety, depression, brain fog, fatigue, insomnia which all make for a bad time. No access to a psych, so I self medicated. Today I actually felt slightly less fatigued despite getting poor sleep, so that’s encouraging. The cravings otherwise aren’t too, too strong. Because I know it’ll just make me feel crappy, off, thirsty, guilty, etc. No matter how unproductive and lazy I feel, or like a day is not used properly, at least I know I didn’t use. 

I walk almost daily for 30 min-1 hr with my SO and that’s helped a lot. The RLS killed me at first, but that’s subsided. Day 5 was the worst for me, that’s when my eyes swelled up and I had extreme anxiety and wondered if my organs were quitting or something, especially after reading that this Herxheimer reaction can mean the kidneys/liver are working hard to detox. I remember being scared to fall asleep with this overwhelming dread and impending doom. It didn’t feel like drifting off, it felt like I was dissolving away (this is anxiety/panic attacks) and might not wake up. After day 7-8, there was a huge improvement. The smell seems to still be here in my nose ever so slightly, but I also wonder if it’s just in my head at this point.

I’m going to try keto soon. I did it some years ago for a month because of PCOS and to lose 20 pounds, then switched to a mostly low carb, low glycemic more lax way of eating. It worked, but what I didn’t expect was the insane shift in energy and mood on keto. Seriously felt so good and clear mentally and have never since or before felt that way. Not quite ready yet, as I’m trying to take it easy on myself and heal, but that’s my next step this month. I don’t have weight concerns, but man if it can give me that energy that pushed me to use kratom in the first place, I’ll be very happy and it’ll be worth it. I slept so good, felt so active and confident, and my anxiety was nonexistent.

Yesterday, between the 48h and 54h mark I was still dying. anxious and depressed af, malaised, queazy, exhausted, chills and all.

Anyway, since I woke up today (60h on awakening), I've felt like my normal self..? I had kava last night if that means anything, and slept like complete shit still. But for real, I visited my family, ran for 45 mins, and have been walking around the city like normal.

I can't imagine I'm in the clear, but in my last quits these pink clouds never lasted more than an hour or two.

It helped me immensely with back pain, also I work 12-16hr night shifts and I’m a dad of four. It gave me so much energy. I started 3 years ago taking it once and a while and eventually ended up taking 7-8 grams every four hours. For the first time ever I had anxiety, depression and I was losing my cool on my wife and kids on a regular basis. I was waking up in the morning feeling withdrawals because I wouldn’t take it within three hours of bedtime. Then, all of a sudden I couldn’t keep an erection and that was the LAST STRAW...I dropped from 7 grams 4-5x a day to 4 grams twice a day and I got SICK. I had no motivation, couldnt sleep, felt like a blob, and had BAD diarrhea. That was the worst part, my wife thought We were gonna split up,I wanted to be able to have sex at 35 so I stuck to it and after a week I dropped a half a gram each dose every three-four days until I got down to 1gram every twelve hours. After 4-5 days of that (three days ago) I forgot to take my afternoon dose. I realized it at about 10pm and I laid awake all night. I felt fine but couldn’t sleep. So I made the leap of faith and because I had walked down to such a small dose I felt great and haven’t noticed a difference. Oh and my mental state improved and started to improve rite away, my mojo is back with a vengeance and has been GREAT. I feel like myself again and I’m never going back to it. Good bye kratom I’ll miss you when my back hurts. If you’re considering taking it don’t do it! 
Things that helped...
-5-htp (at night)
 -b6,b12,multivitamins(bodybuilding ones have everything)
-TRIBULUS will make you feel like a PORNSTAR

So far sleep hasn't been disturbed too much but I am beginning to feel all the little aches and pains again. I know some will say that that's just the kratom causing the aches and pains, which it could be but then again I don't know and it worries me. 

The worst aspect of kratom for myself, is that I've completely let my body go. I gained 60lbs in the last year and my bodies atrophied. I've also developed several problems with my bones, tendons, and nerves since the last time I quit, probably from not being so active. Quite frankly, this scares the hell out of me. I know I can improve my physical health and mitigate most if not all injuries I've developed but without kratom I just feel so weak. Kratom has always at least gave me the illusion of being strong but as soon as I let her go, those illusions will fade quickly and I'll be smacked in the face with reality. I never want to return to this substance after I quit this time but I'm not entirely 100% optimistic if I can't find the strength to fix my body on my own.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8469787}"

I’m finding this part really tough because of the psychological dependence I’ve formed. My depression and anxiety have been awful and I struggle to make it though the day, time drags on very slowly and I do my best to find something to occupy myself (watch tv, read, meditate, go for a walk, maybe meditate a bit). I have a demanding job too and am having to struggle to get my work done (I work from home). 

I’ve used kratom to deal with the depression and anxiety, but also a chronic pain condition. I know that these are legitimately difficult health conditions to be managing but I still feel awful about myself. My wife is the most amazing person in the world and she has been not only in the loop but helping me through the quitting process. I feel like I’m letting her down because I can’t taper faster.

I'm Jon I just wanted to introduce myself, I'm aged 39 from Scotland and I have been using Kratom on and off for 2.5 years, I'm married with 2 kids (1 and 7).

Initially I took Kratom as an alternative to alcohol after I had decided to quit drinking alcohol which had become problematic for me, I used it quite ocassionally at first although I always binged, I increased my consumption after my second son was born in November 2018 to help with sleep deprivation and parental anxiety and that is when it became habitual, I have had countless attempts to quit and even went back to drinking alcohol a fair bit since COVID-19.

I'm pretty sure I have had the virus in March which resulted in hospital treatment for sepsis (although I was never tested) after hospital I quit for 40 odd days (my personal best) as I was just too sick.

Currently I'm on day 8 of CT after a short taper from 20gpd to about 7gpd (I have took up to 60gpd in the past), I wanted to reach out for support this time as it is something I found useful when I initially went from drinking alcohol almost everyday to 17 months abstainence from the booze.

I now understand that I am an addict and regardless of substance I need to be sober, its anxiety and fatigue which pull me back every time.

Hoping that this reddit will be helpful.

I was an opiate addict for 15 years.  In the recent past I developed a pretty nasty benzo addiction to boot.  I did ibogaine a few months ago to to get off suboxone, which worked like a charm.  Walked away totally opiate withdrawal and craving free.  Unfortunately, ibogaine doesn't work for benzos, so I've had to taper from 25mg of xanax a day down to 1.5mg of clonazepam a day.  I initially started using kratom to deal with the benzo detox, and in that regard, it's helped immensely.  I've taken on average 3 to 4 teaspoons of high quality maeng da kratom for about a week now.

Trigger Warning: eating disorder/disordered eating,"I’ve been using kratom daily for over two years, up to 20gpd. Long story short it’s taken over my life. My day revolves around kratom. I hate it. 

I’m 29 years old, naturally slender - approx 135 lbs (on average,) and 5 foot 7 inches tall. 

All my life since I was a young child, people would jokingly (or seriously) accuse me of being anorexic or of having an eating disorder because “how can you always stay so thin when you eat as much McDonald’s as you do blah blah blah.”  Thank god I had never actually had an eating disorder - I was just always naturally very thin. I ate and ate and ate to my hearts content.  Never mattered what I ate Id just stay skinny. I never lost weight and never gained weight. 

In my late twenties (25 to 27) my metabolism finally slowed down a little bit and I slowly gained 20 well needed pounds. I went from 127 lbs to 147 lbs. I finally had a bit of a butt, a small set of D-cup boobies, and all kinds of “thiccness” I had never had before.  And I loved it! I finally felt comfortable in my own skin.  For once I didn’t feel like people were looking at how skinny I was in the grocery store. 

Then 2020 happened. Oh, 2020. You fuckin’ bitch... Lol. I think for the most part we can agree that 2020 has been absolute shit. Well, for me it’s been shit for all the reasons it’s been shit for you, plus the fact I think my kratom addiction has created an EATING DISORDER. 

I started to notice around May, and then really started to notice in late July that I had gotten fucking skinny again. Like really skinny.  In the back of my mind I heard a voice say “yeah bitch it’s cause you barely eat - all you do is drink kratom you fucking idiot.”  I was in denial. Kratom isn’t causing me to not eat. I’m just really busy with my new job... right?

I finally stepped on a scale last week, Monday August 3.  The blue numbers popped up like a ghost - “129LBS.”  Pfft yeah right there’s no way. I step on it again: “129LBS.” 

Fuck. 

All of a sudden I came to terms with the fact that I have not only been skipping breakfast, but lunch and sometimes dinner too. Kratom has been my main source of sustenance, which isn’t sustenance at all. All of the times I made my husband dinner but then only ate a couple bites of mine, or just didn’t eat at all flashed in my mind.  When he’s ask why I wasn’t eating I’d say I wasn’t feeling good, wasn’t hungry, or that I’d ate a late lunch... but then I’d sneak into our en-suite bathroom, lock the door, pull out my kratom and shaker cup from underneath the sink and make a green sludge potion, drinking it in secret... I knew it wasn’t right but my brain would justify this behaviour over and over again. 

Bottom line I can’t believe I legitimately made it through my whole adolescence without developing an eating disorder even thought I was always accused of having one, only to have KRATOM give me an eating disorder close to my thirties. What the actual fuck. 

I thought to write this out because I just ate a whole big bowl of rice with broccoli and chicken - one of my favourite healthy meals. This was the first entire balanced meal I can remember eating in weeks. But as soon as I put my fork down in that empty bowl I felt guilty. Because now the kratom I had an hour before, (and the kratom I’ll inevitably have in the next hour or so) will just get absorbed by the food and I won’t get that “feel-good, talkative feeling” I crave.

I feel like most people make it through the withdrawal and that's the end of it. They may relapse one day, or have some issues with focus/depression/motivation, etc.

That's always been the case for me with past quits. This time, it's more like I can't really deal with the emotions being back. It feels good for a little while, but overwhelming too. I got through being sick, but still take it. Around once a week, I take an extract. I always feel guilty the next day, and sometimes worry i'm going to get hit with withdrawal, but it doesn't happen. The thing that keeps me going back to it, is that I start to feel just.. like the feelings, thoughts, ambition and motivation are overwhelming. I have so much shit to do that i'd just rather not. This might sound ridiculous but it's distressing, really. I make it 5 days every time, sometimes 4, and it gets to a point where I just feel like I can't stay like this. It's like a positive anxiety and good mood, but still unbearable in the same ways normal anxiety would be. Sucks, because one of the lasting effects i get from kratom is a lack of desire for sex, and this extends past my 5 days of sobriety (i've quit before, usually takes a month or so for sex drive to come back for me) and obviously my fiancee is unhappy. I always told myself, every time I got addicted to opiates, kratom, whatever else, that it was the withdrawal keeping me from quitting. Each time it got bad enough to where I eventually -had- to quit, did, and stayed clean for a year or so before relapsing, but now I realize it's not even the withdrawal. It's the fact that I can't deal with feeling things when sober. Even though I have no withdrawal symptoms, it still feels like it's a humongous relief when I take it. I know it's going to get bad again if I keep this up, as the time between usages always gets slightly shorter until you're taking it daily again.

Hopefully this made sense. Things don't feel hopeless but just disconcerting, like I don't have control over myself. I'm trying to push it to two weeks just to see if the feeling will fade. On day 4 right now since my last time, and I feel fine physically, but i'm sitting here listening to music and every third thought in my head is ""you shouldn't be feeling this, go pick up extract"".

It was my first day of hearing my inner voice again, the depersonalization is slowly lifting. I’ve almost convinced myself 100% I don’t have a brain tumor and I’m not dying soon, it’s just the withdrawal and the resurfacing anxiety. I feel like I’m finally getting into my head again, and my vision is almost back to 100%! It’s still a little foggy and weird at times, but it’s good. Memories are starting to resurface too. All around I feel improvements, but I’m not going to get my hopes up too much, I’m just gonna take it one day at a time. I’m still going to the doc tomorrow to talk about my crippling anxiety and how to satiate my fears of death and brain tumors but I’m starting to develop my identity again which I thought was impossible.

For those of you who struggle immensely with the withdrawal when it comes to anxiety and depersonalization, just hang on. The first few weeks were complete torture and agony, but this community is lovely and can really help ease some of your worries. My withdrawal was so bad I convinced myself I was legitimately going to die, and I morbidly painted scenes of telling my family goodbye all the time. It gets better I promise. I found that the one thing that helps the most is digging up nostalgic things you did when you were younger, and reliving those sweet, tender moments. I dug out a bunch of my old Nintendo games and blasted through those and it sincerely helped calm me down.

Edit: the mornings and the nights are the worst. When I first wake up the depersonalization is at its peak and so is the anxiety but it settles as the day goes on.",16,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.72488517}"

A big part of my suffering has been related to alcohol and cigarettes. I have drank about 6 times since jumping and maybe 4 of those times I got obliterated black out. Then acted the fool. Peed myself twice. It's as if all that inner addict just goes ham once I let the alchy get in my system. I've always told myself I didn't have a problem with alcohol but if there is one thing for sure it is that alcohol is absolutely positively destructive in every sense of the word. Oh yeah and I got a problem with it.

Ciggys man they r fucking nasty and I've been quit and been back and forth for the past year or so. Now when I smoke I feel like shit. Even with that I am tempted to smoke right now just writing this message. I've got Nicotine replacement and I'm going to continue to use those the next couple days as i focus on sobriety.

The real suffering in relation to these other substances has been sitting back and watching myself do these things. I know better. I've known better for a long time. I am creating my suffering when I partake. It's to the point where drinking or smoking just dont even feel good to me but I go through the motions because that is what I have always done. I pour the drink down my throat. I inhale the smoke into my lungs. At least I'm not eating a shitload of powder throughout my day.

Starting week 5 now. Feeling a lot more clear and motivated to stay on the straight and narrow. I have an issue with substances. In a lot of ways that issue is my superpower. But only when I take control and start creating new patterns instead of following old. I release the bullshit.

I haven't had any serious cravings since quitting. I consider myself fortunate in that regard. Sleep on the other hand... First month = Insomnia. Next 2 weeks = decent sleep (closer to normal). This past week or so sleep hasn't been great. Been hit or miss. Attitude has been better this week, despite the living situation after the storm. 

Overall, my two main sticking points have inconsistent sleep and back pain. The strongest thing I take now is Ibuprofen and CBD.

I think the taper down method would work best for me. Do I need to buy it in powder form in order to ease myself off? Or can I just take less and less capsules each day?

I have never done, nor even seen kratom in a powder or capsule form.  I have ONLY done tinctures, aka extracts aka liquid shots.

First of all I just wanted to give some background. I am 19 and decided to quit CT (2yrs \~ 20gpd) because I felt like my happiness relied on it and it reduced my motivation for everything else. I'm on Day 4 and I feel so much better. To be honest I've been lucky with WD's. The first 1.5 days were really tough but honestly once I got it in my head that I am doing this for myself, that there is meaning in all the suffering, and that I would be so much happier without it , I've been feeling so much better and I've been at 90% since Day 3.

Now that I got the background outta the way I was wondering purely out of curiosity what the minimum amount of time is that one should wait after quitting CT to take an opioid like codeine because I have a wisdom teeth removal coming up, without obviously messing with your withdrawals (by restarting them)? And if you could give me the physiological explanation that'd be amazing!

Thank you guys for all your help and if you are trying to quit or are quitting, know that most of this is in your head ( at least imo). Although for me there was definitely a physical withdrawal, it wasnt until I truly realized that I just dont want to take Kratom anymore and that I wanted better for myself that I felt much better and honestly you owe it to yourself to quit because not only will you be back to normal relatively soon but you will come out stronger, more grateful, and happier!",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9018956}"

We only have a finite amount of willpower and we need to strategically use it, while battling this addiction. And we need to build it up by focusing on as little as possible. It is easier to focus and store surpluses of willpower the less things you have to worry about. 

As for mindset, the truth is the cure to fixing a bad habit. Always be honest with yourself. For example, a smoker will be able to quit easier if they see a loved one pass away from lung cancer and use this a reason to stop. This is what I mean by the truth and what you can use as a reason to quit to focus your mindset.

Willpower is useful too but remember you will get drained periodically throughout the day by random emotional stressors. Sometimes you will get traumatized by some event while tapering or when quitting CT. It is important to limit stress as much as possible in order to store energy for willpower during these critical moments. 

Also, make a list of reasons to quit and cultivate the right mindset to quit. If anyone can add to this it would be helpful.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5055251}"

This has been the single most valuable thing to help me get any time at all!  I developed a friendship with someone on this site and we text almost daily.  K is tricky and it helps to bounce what you are thinking and feeling off of someone who has been there.  They can tell you what you can expect, give you advice and hold you accountable.  The people on this site want to see you succeed and they genuinely care about you – so reach out!!  
For example, after the acutes - I would be feeling pretty good and then out of nowhere I would just feel down for no reason.  This was disappointing and in my previous quits – I would just say f it, I may as well take some k if I am just going to feel like this and I was off to the races again.  The person I connected with on this site told me - yup you are going to have bad days but hang in there they go away.  They were right - I would wake up a day or two later feeling good again.  I also learned, with some guidance, that the times in-between grow longer.  That was also true and now I feel more stabilized.  There are still good and bad days, just not as severe of a difference, but I’d say it is just kind of how life is and should be.  You shouldn’t just be always numbed out with some occasional lifts from just taking a dose.
IMHO - in the first week to 10 days - if you need some help with clonindine or something to sleep, I suppose use it but I feel like other substances just get in the way of us healing and feeling good again. At least for me, they can cause a relapse.  The only way through it is through it.  Natural supplements are the way to go, or nothing.  
Exercise!!!! This will save your ass.
If you feel depressed – realize it is temporary.  You have really jacked your brain up for a while and it is trying to heal.    Your mind will also tell you – you HAVE to have some k - you feel too bad, depressed… whatever.  Or hey you have had 5 days off, it wasn’t all that bad just have a little and start over again on Monday.  Don’t listen to it. I relapsed more times than I can count. If you slip up, it’s okay just get back on the wagon, even if it is a long slip up.  Even if you slipped up a gazillion times before.  Slip ups.. relapses are just part of the process for a lot of us.  Never quit quitting.  I know that 53 days is just a start but I remember thinking that was a really long time.  And it effin is for someone like me.  I was hoping maybe something I had to say might help someone else who is just getting started, I know how bad it sucks. 
I am not sure I am feeling 100% and I am not sure I am not.  I am happy with where I am and am enjoying the journey.  I don’t even think of taking K right now, it is never on my mind.

I bought some skullcap tincture from Amazon because I had read really good things about it on another QK forum on Facebook, and I thought hey maybe I can use it in place of my Klonopin when I quit, since I'm about out.  The first couple of times I took it, I used the recommended dosage, which is 1 dropper full.  It definitely surrounded me in a warm, fuzzy blanket and I slept well.  As with just about any herbal remedy that I've ever taken I developed a tolerance to it very quickly.  The other night I decided to take 2 droppers full, along with my regular dose if gabapentin 600 mg before I went to bed.  Now, I've been waking up every night for the last 3 months drenched in sweat.  I mean, like dripping down my neck and legs....it's very gross, even worse than hormonal hot flashes.  So when I took the 2 droppers the other night, I slept all the way through the night until 7 a.m.  I haven't done that in months--and my clothes were dry!  I did it again last night.  I did wake up once because the cat woke me up, but once again I was not sweating.  I can't say it will effect everyone this way, but for me, this is huge.  Since I do develop a tolerance to these things quickly, I won't be doing this every night; I'm going to try and save it for when I get the courage to quit Kratom....hopefully within the next couple of days.  Another one I'm going to try is Motherwort.  I'm reading great things about it as well.  I always read the reviews before I buy anything like this, and I'm pretty excited to try it.  Maybe during withdrawals I can switch back and forth between the two.  I just wanted to share my short experience with this herb in case it helps someone else.  :)

Days 3 and 4 were easily the worst of days. On day 4 I started taking CBD oil 3x a day (1,000mg) and it cleared away ALL my symptoms; cold chills, cold sweats and RLS. 

I felt some chills today for about 20 minutes but was out of CBD. By the time I bought some, chills were gone and they weren’t bad to begin with. It was funny going to the smoke shop, the guy turned to grab me Kratom and I said “Nah man, I told you last week I was quitting!” 

I got some magnesium and 5-thp just to provide a little extra relief down the road. While I’m feeling GREAT right now, I want to stay ahead of potential PAWS. 

Strangely, I have not once had the urge to take more, even with the WD’s were at their worst. Since I took it on a set schedule before, I noticed a couple times I caught myself saying “Time for.....Nothing!” 

I’m so glad to be done with this garbage! Thank you all who gave support/wisdom!

2020-08-07 11:47:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/i5g709/a_year_sober/,A Year Sober,"Hi Everyone, I don't know if anyone remembers me, I haven't posted in a long time, but this forum was such a help for me back in the day, I promised myself I'd come back at the one year mark to check in.  I actually don't know the exact quit date but it was right around this time a year ago.

I was heavily addicted to Kratom (sober from alcohol 30 years, so clearly I have a very addictive personality).  Kratom owned me back then. I started taking it more out of curiosity because I had heard or read that it's calming, sort of a natural non-addictive high.  Comes from a plant, how dangerous could it be?  I honestly had no idea and actually belonged to a FB group that celebrates their Kratom use, their stashes, they even make pretty containers to store it in and all that.

I am not in any way knocking Kratom for those it may genuinely be helping, those who don't have an addictive personality and who don't abuse it.  Unfortunately, it just wasn't me.  I was taking more Kratom a day than probably anyone on this forum, or darn close.  I would take so much at once, I literally couldn't walk normally.  

I was spending TONS of money, my hair was falling out, I detached from all of life, and really I was just a shell of the person I used to be.  I still remember looking in the mirror one morning horrified at the person looking back at me.  Gaunt, no life, no light.  I started crying, I wanted ME back, where did I go?

I couldn't quit.  Couldn't make it one day.  My self-talk (in hindsight) was hilarious ""just do it on weekends, no big deal"", ""you can control this, just cut back"", ""just this once won't hurt"".  Lie after lie after lie.  I failed over and over and over again.  People would say ""if I could do it, you can do it"", and it meant nothing to me.  I did not believe I could do it, not for a hour let alone for the rest of my life.

Then one day, my little dog Bean started coughing.  I had rescued him when he was approx. 10 years old.  Took me two years to get my first kiss, but eventually we became the best of pals and the joy in his eyes when he understood that he was wanted, loved, safe, and never leaving me was indescribable.  I don't really know his history other than he came to me petrified of his own shadow.

As soon as I heard that first cough, I knew.  Perhaps it was intuition, but I absolutely knew this was not good.  Right around the same time I had run out of Kratom one morning, I was in my car, and I still remember saying to myself ""no, we're not going to the store, we're not buying anymore Kratom ever again"", and no kidding - that was it, I've never touched it since.  100% cold turkey (I forgot to mention that I also failed a million times trying to taper, I just don't have that kind of control).

It was rough, I won't lie, but it wasn't TRAUMATIZING.  In my head I was convinced that quitting was going to be the worst thing I ever experienced, but it wasn't - not even close.  It wasn't fun, I never want to do it again, but it was no where near what I thought it would be.  It was like a bad flu.  I remember just staring at the wall and crying my eyes out for two days.  I quit on a Thursday morning, Friday I went to work and I was numb, and hardly got anything done, but I made it.  Sat and Sun were the two worst days and those are the two days I didn't move and I just cried.  I didn't care.  I didn't care how bad it would get, I had made the decision that I quit no matter the cost.  I was ready for the boogyman to come get me, but he never showed up.

I then put all my attention on Bean (all my money too), and we had some of the very best days ever.  I have lots of pictures and video's, just us sitting out in the sun taking in the smells of autumn, the sounds of the birds, while enjoying the feel of a warm breeze (all of this I ignored while taking Kratom).  Beanie had lots of belly rubs and I got lots of kisses.

My little boy passed away in my arms about 3 months after I quit Kratom.  Even now, the tears come.  I have often wondered if, on some higher level, he agreed to get sick in order to save me.  That's exactly what it seems like.  When I was on Kratom I barely paid any attention to my dogs but at the time, I thought I was a great mom - they were well fed, exercised, etc.  But the truth is, they were waiting for their mom the whole time, I was physically there but mentally/emotionally absent.   I actually remember when I was taking Kratom saying to myself ""they know"" as they didn't avoid me, but they weren't their normal goofy energetic selves, they had more of a ""cautious"" vibe around me.

Today, even with the shut down and all that's going on in the world, I'm good.  I'm even great most days.  I appreciate everything and everyone so much more than I did.  I count my blessings (I didn't have any when I was on Kratom, so I thought), and I blow kisses to Beanie's picture often, I miss him terribly.  He's not just my little boy but he's my little hero too.  I saved him and then he saved me.

Also because of Bean, I rescued another little guy, 15 years old, who nobody wanted.  I have a baby too, Vida, who will be a year in a few days.  I call her Vida my PITA because she is a relentless PITA but I love her madly and wonder if Bean didn't bring her to me.  

Anyhoo- there's my story.  I hope it helps someone because if you're reading here, you know you want to quit and NEED to quit, or stay quit and you can, you absolutely can.  Pray, visualize, count your blessings.  Know you're worth it, that YOU matter.  Because you do, we all do.  Much love, Beanie's Mommy.",85,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5572886}"

I then began getting electric shocks in my toe.

I still feel every sensation it just feels really tight and sensitive.

So I've been a kratom user for many years and I really want to stop.. I've been tapering for months and go through withdrawal EVERY DAY. I stopped all together for three days this week and the anxiety, severe depression, chills and sweats are still present.. I've tapered down to 10 grams a day, at one point I was taking 3 oz. A day.

My question is will this ever end? Even tapering is incredibly hard.. I broke down on day 3 and bought some kratom. I have to work to pay rent and cant take time off work..

I bought from a different vendor and I feel so much better after a 5 gram dose, I can function. But the withdrawal is still there underneath the uplift from the dose. I was buying from one source before yesterday and I'm also curious, could it have been laced?

I've been through prescription opiate withdrawal before and it was 10x worse but this is still pretty unbearable.. I don't know what to do and think I'll never get away from kratom.. I've been going through withdrawals daily since I began to taper. It has been months of feeling like total garbage. I began thinking of ending it, really ending it all this week, every day..

The fact that I believed for 8 months straight that this was going to be ok was a massive fluke in my defense mechanism. Oh yeaaa head shop stuff. 20 dolla for 60g stuff. Pick that beauty up and its the honey moon phase. There isnt really any restraint here. I dont have a medical diagnosis to justify my use of kratom. I just randomly heard from a friend said,"" these will make you feel good"" so i took 12 caps. I believe thats 6 g of some nice mid grade smoke shop kratom. Next thing i knew, the warm feeling comes. And im like, YO this shit is an opiate right? Because YEA I actually have an obsession with drugs thats all consuming, but any way so goes my kratom tales.

Kratom became a priority to me. I would make sure that all the assets of the day were acumulated to getting a 60g tub of dat meang da. I would use it recreationally, which seems to be the main cause of my kratom troubles.. It would be right when i woke up ""nooooooooo"" then anxiety rush comes on and provokes to that one special thing  KRATOM. In the mornings. Needed it. Something that may  make this post pop out is the inchoherent continuem of events being spewed by yours truly. Which is a very accurate resprsentsation of how life for me seems to be a neverending unfolding of further conundrums, but especially so after kratom was introduced. I was enjoying the mild effecfs of the kratom for a while , hard to pin point when the doses escalated to a daily habit but i  was chuggin with kratom  for 8 months, 15 -20 grams of sludge were consumned on a daily basis by me but it was wildly inconsistant. Some days i would binge on it just craving a silly little high that wasnt really appearing anymore. That kratom magic was noticibly waining. So whats the most inagenious response to such a.problem? 
DOUBLE DOSE 
More is better right?  My double doses were feeling on point. Without a care in the world straight faded yep love it. But then THAT was lost and i was starting to panic inside. And the pattern that was obvious all along ""damn this is some for real stuff"", Became exceptionally clear. I was building a tolerance and it was losing its spark. I managed to avoid any type of significant WD  effect through utilization of pharms such as gabapentin, loperimide and the sort but damn did that feeling of not having the kratom haunt me. Such bad anxiety and crippling deppression coupled with some gnarly akathisia were felt.
 The lonliness instilled upon me by kratom is very haunting.. it also makes me react irritabley to other wise nonsenscensacal shit that doesnt matter. KRATOM doesnt matter too me now. I dreaded having to do a taper but i pretty much went from 25gpd to  6gpd in two days. Yea super quick to get it over with but that didnt spare me  from that nasty anxiety feeing of withdrawal creeping in at odd intervals. 

 I just feel a lil tensed up right now but the thing is, there really isnt withdrawals with this drug if you have some substituted meds to mimic the effects of kratom. Try getting some gabapentin from  the doc, mine was cool with it and wrote me a scipt to help me off the Green Dragon.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4812807}"

I just thought I'd give everyone a little check in, and maybe even a bit of my story. No real plans with this post, just gonna write and hopefully it helps someone.

Back when I quit, I used to use this forum pretty extensively. I've posted here in the past about serious cravings in the middle of the night, and that omnipresent desire to just use one more time and make the crawling in my skin stop.

Kratom, like I assume for many of us, seemed like a ticket to do anything when I discovered it. I felt like I could totally be myself. Social interactions didn't bother me. I had confidence. I had energy. The first several months were incredible. I started using kratom in fall of 2015. A local kava shop in my town started selling it, albeit in a more potent (and much more expensive) form that the usual white/red/green powders you see everywhere now. I've been in recovery for a long time, and had literally never heard of it until a few friends in this town (that I was fairly new in) that were also in recovery introduced me to it. I had tried kava before and I enjoyed it. I thought it was harmless, so what's the big deal with kratom? I got one of those drinks (again, they were a concentrated form of kratom and weren't the colored powders - I didn't even know the strains/colors existed until maybe 4 months later) and I was instantly hooked. And I mean instantly.

Like I've said, the honeymoon was great but I also noticed that my mood was ALL OVER the place at first, but nothing that a few drinks couldn't handle. I felt like my depression was getting way worse, but I was able to counteract it every. single. time. I can't overstate how much this stuff felt like a cheat code to me at first. It literally worked every single time.

All of that was fine and well until maybe around 7-8 months of use. At the time I couldn't notice the gradual change, but I started becoming more and more of, let's just call it like it is, an asshole. I felt like I couldn't regulate my emotions as well, and I would lash out at friends over nothing, or at the very least stay on edge. The ""highs"" started lasting less than they used to, and I felt like my anxiety really started shooting through the roof. If I didn't have any kratom, I started noticing some pretty bad discomfort. I had a few stretches before this where I would quit for a few days or a week to ""reset"", and the lack of sleep was physical withdrawals would be pretty bad but nothing I couldn't power through. I distinctly remember that 7-8 month mark (which would have been late summer 2016) was when the physical sensations started diminishing, my anxiety started getting higher, I couldn't focus at work, and worst of all, I developed trust and insecurity issues with every single one of my friends.

It only got worse from there, and the using got higher and higher. I believe my peak usage was early 2017. At this point, I was taking upwards of 5 of those concentrated drinks daily, plus the colored powders. I would do the 5 drinks and go through typically an entire ounce of the powder a day. The physical effects were almost completely gone - it was just to feel normal. If I missed a dose in the morning (which was the only time I felt anything. I would mix my drink before leaving for work, it would hit me on the commute, and be over by the time I got there), I would literally be shaking and sweating during morning standup (nobody ever said anything to me at work and they had to have known something was up). I had pushed a lot of my friends away at this point. Financially, kratom was devastating. I had a very well paying job (my salary alone was more than the median income of the US), and I was constantly broke and overdrawing my account. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that around this time, my habit was costing me over $100 DAILY.

The moment I knew I needed to stop was after a concert I went to that was out of town. It was in a city 4 hours away. I brought along some kratom to keep me company on the way and, on the drive back, I accidentally left my bag at a gas station (I was driving back with a friend who had no idea about my habit, and I would use the 'I have to go to the bathroom' as an excuse to take a dose. I would usually buy a bottle of OJ, pour in some kratom, shake it up, and that would be that. I must have left the bag in the bathroom.) Around this point, if I went longer than 3/4 hours without dosing, I could start to feel withdrawal symptoms. I was freaked out. We were driving back in the middle of the night, I had to work the next day, and I knew there was no way to reup until 11am the next day. I feel like I barely survived that drive. I dropped my friend off and returned home and I've never felt my skin crawl more than it did that night. I didn't sleep at all. I remember literally googling meditation apps and trying them just to sleep for some period of time. Somehow I made it through the night and sent an email to my work about coming in late and having a car appointment - the reality was that my job required me to be there at 10am, the kratom store opened at 11am, and I didn't want to take lunch too early to get there and I couldn't make it to 12pm feeling the way that I did. So I lied. I waited every agonizing hour until I could go in and get my fix.

This post has already gotten long as fuck, so I might as well just keep going with the story. Again, I hope it's helping.

That was the point where I knew I needed to do something. I started dabbling with quitting - a day here, a day there. I resolved to quit for at least 3 days at the beginning of every month to ""reset"", which somehow I was able to do. It sucked every time to do it, and I would typically go out of town that weekend just so I wouldn't be around the store. When I would withdrawal, it felt like I had weights attached to all of my limbs. It was like I was awake but had chronic fatigue the entire time, and not even from lack of sleep (in all the times I quit, the first few nights I would get really bad but SOME sleep, and my sleep would go back to normal by the 4th day). It was like my body just didn't know how to have energy anymore. Getting out of my car and so much as walking was a lot for maybe a solid month.

I kept that cycle up (a few days off, go hard the rest of the month, reset at the beginning of the next month) all the way until the summer. That ""weights everywhere"" fatigue went away after the first month and never came back - my use never again reached the heights I mentioned earlier (>$100, specialized drinks plus at least an oz). However, my performance at work during the time covered by this entire story was complete shit. I ended up getting fired in the middle of summer, which made my use skyrocket for about a month before I found my way back to the ""quit then go"" policy. My first for real quit was November 2017. I quit for about 5 months. It was the fear of the cold and dark of winter that scared me more than anything - my depression also got really bad on kratom and once daily savings time was gone, I knew I had to stop. So I did.

That first time quitting was rough for the first couple of weeks but it eventually got better, and quicker than I thought it would. I definitely experienced some PAWS - at least what I thought was PAWS - which was basically days where I would just randomly be off and couldn't function at all. It was like brain fog that just showed up some days and other days it would be gone. I think because my use was so high, the PAWS pretty much stuck around that entire 5 months, although it got less and less frequent over time.

I also found myself in a relationship not long before quitting, and that also probably softened the blow for me. The one thing I won't forget about quitting was the sheer boredom I felt. It was like NOTHING was interesting. I remember just driving around town because I would be so bored. I would watch random movies just to do it. I literally had to train my brain to find things it liked doing again - it was so crazy to me just how much I didn't give a fuck at first.

It's really, really fucking hard to do, but forcing yourself to do things and to have hobbies and especially exercise was pretty fucking key for me. Eventually my brain got the message and I found myself getting into some hobbies, especially drawing.

I wish I could say that that was the end of the story and it was happily ever after, but I did use again. I ended up getting a job and moving to a new city early 2018. When I quit kratom 5 months prior, my intention was never to quit for good. I couldn't fathom giving it up. I thought I would give myself a nice, long, hard reset, something WAY bigger than the couple of days I would do at the start of every month. I thought this would totally reboot me back to square one.

WRONG.

Right before the move, I was like ""what the hell"" and got a few drinks. They hit me - pretty hard, I might say - but I was pretty much right back to where I was within 3 days. My tolerance shot back up, the physical effects started diminishing, and just like that, I was hooked again. You could barely call it a honeymoon.

I did the move and I kept using in the new city, because I was anxious and scared of meeting new people and I wanted something to calm my nerves. The problem was that I couldn't find stuff in my new town that was as good as where I knew to get it in my old town. The new stuff just hit me differently. I would take it, and I swear it would INCREASE my anxiety. Every time I was in a situation, I would take kratom thinking it would make things better and it would make it worse every time. THAT was a hard pill to swallow. As a result, I not only stopped trusting kratom, I just straight up avoided people because I didn't know what to do.

I ended up quitting again for about two months - June and July - after my reintroduction that lasted maybe 2 weeks. I really can't overstate how quickly my tolerance came back and how quickly I reverted to being an emotional wreck. That girlfriend and I ended up not surviving the move - we broke up about 3 months after I left. She was an absolute saint with all the shit I put her through. Right around our breakup, I started using again only this time she wasn't around. I was really dealing with me now, in a city where I didn't know fucking anyone and didn't know how.

After those 2 months, I started using again early August. I felt like there was a bit of a honeymoon again, but come September it was completely gone and I was again a wreck. I really can't tell you how many awkward fucking dates I went on during this time, loading myself up with kratom thinking I was going to be super cool and calm and I ended up coming off as............definitely not that.

October we had a deadline at work and my only goal was to survive and make it to that and then quit again when we had a little break and I'd go home and see friends and family. I hit the deadline and quit for a few days before the break because I wanted to ""reset"" back home because I knew that's where the good shit was. I went back and it wasn't a terrible trip - the ""good stuff"" hit me pretty good and seeing friendly faces and family really was a sight for sore eyes. However, once the honeymoon was again ""over"" (and during that trip, I had a talk with my girlfriend and we broke up for real for real), I came back to my current city at the beginning of November with all the same problems and addiction again.

November sucked. I used right through the daylight savings shift. More awkward dates. More misery. More loneliness. Which brings me to December. I remember feeling like I had totally missed out on Halloween (and so many other holidays through the course of this story) just because nothing interested me and I just didn't give a shit. I didn't want to fuck up Christmas. I was also just so sick and tired of being sick and tired. I was so tired of time just drifting away from me - I felt like 2016, 17, and 18 just evaporated so quickly without me really having anything to show for it. I remember literally having the thought ""I don't give a fuck if my life is super shitty for the rest of it if I don't use this stuff, I really don't give a fuck, I'm not going to do it anymore"". That was the last time I touched kratom.

I don't want to scare anyone off, and I think my case is probably unique given how much I used and what my body was used to, but the first year was pretty tough. That's not to say it was a shitty year - in a lot of ways, it wasn't. The physical symptoms like the shaking/sleep issues were gone after a few days. The emotional symptoms and the anxiety took a LOT longer to work through. Since my quit date aligns nicely with the years, I'll just say that in 2019 I went on more awkward dates than probably anyone in the history of the world. I didn't have kratom - I just had my own anxiety and insecurity, and............wow. I've never felt so uncomfortable in my own skin on dates in my life. If I'm totally honest, I absolutely traded my kratom addiction for sex that first year. I tied my worth to it and rejection, which I felt like came rarely under the confidence I found under kratom, hurt a lot. Word to the wise - chill on that shit your first year. You have to build your confidence back up to that point with activities and it has to come from you and you alone. Don't kick yourself down a hole you have to climb yourself out of like I did with that shit. 

That wasn't the only place my emotions got me into trouble. I noticed a lot of resentments and anger just showing up in all these ugly ways. I wasn't lashing out at people, but I had a shitty attitude a lot of the time at work and felt like a lot of frustration just followed me around. I still deal with that. I've learned how to be more mindful of it and to just try and let it pass, but before I just couldn't let it pass. I had to react. I had to say something to that person or they'd win and I couldn't have that.

I had PAWS for a long time, which again became less and less frequent over time. The anhedonia - the term I learned for the general disinterest in things - was around for a long time. I had a lot of boring weekends where I didn't know what to do with myself, and I had to force myself to find hobbies and relearn activities to find the same satisfaction I was shortcutting myself into with kratom.

I'd say the first six months were really a roller coaster. Intermittent PAWS, horrific awkwardness, and emotions all over the place. After six months, things started interesting me more - I got into yoga and exercise. I went vegan. I started running and biking and to my great surprise, I actually stuck with all of this.

I really don't think it was until a little after the year mark (that is, this spring) that I actually felt completely ""normal"" again. I've heard that it takes the brain roughly 1.5 to 2 years to totally go back to normal after having a chemical dependency, so that definitely lines up with my experience.

I've definitely had cravings in quarantine - I had a period a couple months ago where I was literally plotting to myself and trying to justify using one night - but I didn't. That's the only time I've had cravings since I quit. I have another job now that's going great, pays well, and is satisfying (for the most part, anyway). I'm getting better with my emotions all the time, and at least know the issues. I'm learning more about confidence, and learning that my worth is defined my anyone but me. I'm still exercising. My interests and hobbies have migrated to writing, foreign languages, and music.

The biggest breakthrough I've had lately is with social anxiety. I was always uncomfortable in groups of people, and after I quit kratom, it was really hard to put myself in those situations. I would say in the last couple of months, that has finally started to become less of an issue (it's still an issue sometimes, but I'm more aware now). I've realized the problem is that I wanted to control how I presented myself to avoid rejection - I couldn't just be cool being me and realizing that I'm fine even if I'm a little off that day. A lot of the issues I've had come down to just letting go, existing, and knowing it's going to be ok.

I've been tempted to use, like I've already said. I haven't, but I've been tempted. I get tempted when I think I'm unable to do things sober that I used to be able to do on kratom. If I look at the so-called ""rosy"" period with kratom - and there for sure were some great memories then - I can start to pick out problems if I'm objective. Sometimes I feel like that was the peak of my life, but it's not true. The reality was was that then, I was doing little more with my life than working, doing kratom, and going out every night. I wasn't actually learning or growing or doing anything than just that, and I really didn't look at work as anything but a means to finance my habit. Nowadays, I'm conversing, exploring, traveling, learning, and doing so much - and not needing a drop of powder to do it.

I know that was a lot. Damn. And, seeing what hour it is, maybe there's someone that will read this right now who's in that same place I was in that fateful night after that show where I left my stash at the gas station, feeling super shitty and not knowing what they're gonna do. I hope this helps you, whoever you are, and just know that you can do it. If I can do it, you can do it. I sure as hell didn't think I could, but 20 months later, it's one of the best things I've ever done.",29,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5488817}"

I’m not condoning the substitution of one drug for another. I am simply sharing how I beat my addiction.

The amount I took was around 40gpd. ( not as bad as some of you)

What’s made me want to quit Kratom most was RLS. Waking up with restless legs was a god damn nightmare (also was taking a huge hit towards my bank account)

Too keep it short and brief I used a stimulant called adderal. I bought 3 30mg tablets off my friend and split them in half (15mg each dose).

Took my last dose (8g) in the morning along with the tablet. Me having no tolerance to this stim, i was bouncing off the walls. Work was fantastic, towards the end is when I started feeling the withdrawal so I took the other half. 

BOOM withdrawals were dialed down to about a 1/10.  The depression and suicidal thoughts were absolutely gone. Although I was sweating like a pig.

The most insane thing I’ve noticed, I wasn’t even thinking about Kratom at all. 

Wash rinse and repeat, once 3 days went by I crashed and slept for 12 hours.

Now I know some of you are gonna say, “well now your addicted to adderal”

I’m not actually. In fact I woke up with 0 withdrawal but a slight headache

An alternative would be to try caffeine or pre workout. Anything that can give you a buzz (even cigarettes). It all depends on how much you want to quit kratom. It will at least lessen the amount you take daily making the taper insanely easier.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45442098}"

So I’ve had quite the experience getting off Kratom this time around. I was using anywhere from 20-40 GPD for just about 3 years daily, with a few brief quits sprinkled in there. I’m a medical student who is about to go back into hospitals for rotations so I figured I’d get off the sludge for good about 20 days ago. I had about 2 weeks where I tried to rapid taper and I think that that helped alleviate the RLS, flu like sxs and other more severe manifestations of withdrawal I’ve felt in the past.

My first week was a breeze (with the assistance of clonazepam); slept every night which definitely helped with the massive fatigue I’ve had in the past with my quits. Once I was done with the benzo assistance, sleep started getting harder to come by and still isn’t completely back to normal, but I’m getting 6-7 hours a night which is a godsend.

The symptoms I’m still experiencing include cravings from the time I wake up till about 5 PM; to deal with those I usually get on here and read about the experiences of those who have relapsed and try to “play the tape foreword”. Apart from the cravings, I still feel a bit depersonalized throughout the day and am definitely not back to myself, even though I’ve sadly kind of forgotten what that feels like. 

The reason I’m posting is really just to help with my cravings and admit that I have thought about relapsing, even though the logical part of my brain knows where that would lead again. I also wanted to contribute rather than just read off this sub all day and have some dialogue with you wonderful people.

I posted awhile back about how I took a walk through hell to quit kratom. I used Naltrexone 12.5mg to precipitate the withdrawals. It worked! However, it was pure hell for around 6 hours or so. Anyways, weeks went by and I got strong PAWS. I wasn’t prepared for that so I relapsed. It was during the start of quarantine and that didn’t help. 

Last night at 11:30 I took the same amount of Naltrexone (12.5) and went to my room to ride it out. I had Klonopin, Gabapentin, and Promethazine as my helpers. From 12:30-4:30 I had extreme restless legs (the worst you can ever imagine), hot flashes, sweating and a feeling of bugs crawling through my skin. I would lay still and then immediately contract all my muscles and flail, kick, sit up, or punch the air. I hated it. I hated myself for putting me in that position because I couldn’t control my addiction. I was ashamed of myself. 

Today, my wife came up to the room and woke me up at 130pm. My mind was super foggy and my body hurt. I still feel a little RLS but it so little that if I don’t think about it, then I don’t notice it. Overall, I feel like I’m close to my normal self.

Started taking speciosa back in 2012, and my habit gradually grew to about 15g-25g a day of Red Bali from a well-known supplier. Before starting the taper, I was taking small doses many times a day without really measuring. 

I started with a dosing schedule of 4g (morning), 4g (noon), 4g (dinnertime), 4g (before bed) and have been gradually knocking off .1 g from each dose. For example, on the second day, I took 3.9g (morning), 3.9g (noon), 3.9g (dinnertime), and 3.9g (before bed). The next day was 3.8 g. The next day was 3.7 g. And so on... 

I noticed slight withdrawal symptoms about two weeks into the taper, and some folks suggested that I might be reducing my dose too quickly. Luckily, those symptoms abated and I was able to painlessly continue with the same regimen. As of today, I'm taking 1.8 g four times a day, so I've already managed to cut my overall consumption by more than half. 

This week, I've started noticing a bit of fatigue that reminds me of what I have experienced in the past when access to kratom has been disrupted. I'm hesitant to increase the dose, but want to figure out a way to make this a tiny bit smoother. I'm weighing two options: 

**Option #1.** Stick at the same level for two or three days before the next reduction. So, I'll take 1.8g today and tomorrow. I'll take 1.7 g on Friday/Saturday. This will extend the amount of time it takes me to taper, but I'll still be heading in the right direction. 

**Option #2.** Continue reducing on a daily basis but try to reduce by less than 0.1g on each dose. I might go from 1.8 to 1.75 to 1.7 to 1.65 and so on... The overall daily reduction would be 0.2g, but the per-dose reduction would only be 0.05g. This seems like it could work, but it almost seems laughable to be obsessing about 0.05g of kratom. 

If I pursue Option #1, I'm not sure if I should stick with a two-day or three-day period before the next dose reduction. Everyone is different, but I would be grateful to know what others experienced. 

I'm really not sure about Option #2 and am curious to know if anyone else has tried to taper with such tiny reductions to each dose.

So far only mild symptoms like mildly decreased mood, occasional goosebumps, very mild aches, and feeling restless. Slept like poo last night. Unfortunately I know the worst is coming... sure wish it would just get here because this waiting game is killing me. 

My questiions are regarding the timing of the supplements many of the guides and others have listed on here. 

For example while I'm in acute withdrawal over these next few days should I take supplements like L-dopa, l-glutamine, black seed oil, etc or are those best for paws? Don't want to do anything that will slow the process or make it worse.

Below are the supplement I have... would really appreciate if anyone could offer advice on when to take them. 

Also, did any of you exercise during the acute withdrawal process, or is that best saved until PAWS kicks in?

Supplements I have:

Black seed oil

L glutamine

L tyrosine

L- Dopa

L theanine

Passion flower

Ashwaghanda 

Kava

Valerian

Magnesium

Fish oil

ALA

Thanks, and any advice on killing the boredom and making the time go by quicker would be appreciated too. Thanks again. Wish me luck. I have a feeling I've got a rough few weeks/months ahead of me. Just trying to take it all one day at a time

I have stayed strong and positive up until day 6 CT and I would do absolutely anything to go back to that day. My strength and willpower was unexplainable. Then later that day after my post was the start of my hope of quitting being crushed. So let me back track. In the past, I have spent over a 1000$ on adulterated OPMs liquid kratom shots. I am pretty great at spotting one, but I usually gave into one out of desperation of finding a real one and trying it out anyway. I have asked the company countless times for a resolution and have never got an answer back. Two weeks ago I tried again. I bought from a trusted source, but the smell of the kratom was really off (I only bought 9 OPMs liquid kratom shots from this source). This is part of what led me to quit. I was sick of driving to smoke shops all over the state trying to find real kratom and for the best price. When I emailed the company this time around they said that they believe the batch that I had was real, but if theres a suspicious smell, they will replace them. I said ok thats fine and asked when will I get them. I did not get a response for two weeks up until Day 6 CT. The guy said he was on vacation and asked how many I needed. I told him I already took them a week ago before I quit in desperation to get rid of all of the kratom. They claimed they were real, even though I felt nothing, but this is besides the point. I told him how sick I was of all the wasting so much money on the fake shots and that I was done. That was the end of the conversation and I got no reply. I did them so I expected there to be no answer after that anyway because I said that I quit. Yesterday I was going about my day on Day 8 CT when I get a package in the mail. I was so excited I thought I got one of the items I ordered for my car. I opened the box in my room during this massive storm in my state. I had no power. It was dark and lonely. I did not feel good. When I opened the box, there was a half of box of OPMs shots sitting in the box in front of me glaring at me. I feel like the company realized how much money I spent on these and heard that I quit, and sent them anyway like cold hearted people. I got up shaking. My stomach was turning. I ended up having to go to the bathroom 6 times after that. My blood pressure was rising and the dark depression started creeping up on me. I got in my car and went to a creek in the rain and sat outside in the rain for hours. I felt like I couldn’t escape this. I lost all hope. I am sitting here freezing cold and there’s a half of box of these demon shots in my room. I had the strength to face war during this withdrawal. However, I also had no kratom around me. Once the withdrawals go away I don’t care what is around me, I am done. However, I felt uncomfortable for 9 days and the only thing that could take that pain away immediately was sitting right in front of me. I hate kratom and everything that it has done to me. There feels like theres a devil in my room. I lost all hope. I am depressed. When the storm calmed down last night I went for a walk until 3 am (also due to the power being out). However, I kept coming back to a room full of kratom. I am so lost. I am in such a dark place.

2020-08-04 14:50:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/i3p7h2/rehab_thoughts/,Rehab? Thoughts?,"Hello! I'm just looking for opinions from others who have also had a long hard battle with kratom/quitting.   
  So basically, I took medical leave from work (because of multiple accidents at work related to using other substances in a very stupid, reckless manner, mainly RC dissos/hallucinogens while using kratom) in order to go to detox, get help, and save my job. I moved out of my room mate's place, back in with family before I left.  


 So I went to detox first. I was put on Subutex, 2mg/2hours as needed for the first 7 days, then I was rapid tapered off of it before I left, which I'd never had experience with either of the Subs, so was in for a pleasant surprise when the withdrawals hit me after I'd gotten home. This led to me picking up some kratom to alleviate those withdrawals. Lesser of two evils, in my head, at least..   
 At the detox facility, they were adamant about an aftercare plan/program, so I told them I'd be going to a 90 day, faith-based non medical rehab back home that I've been to before, which was the least common denominator out of all the potential rehab options for me, as it was the cheapest and closest to me/us.  
    
It took over a week to actually decide that that was the best (financially, my family was paying) option for me, so I ended up going there.  
((( Like I said, I'd been here before several years prior for the same thing, kratom, I'd finished the program and everything, but ended up relapsing 2 months after getting out the first time. I knew it wouldn't work long term for me, but figured it was a good starting point, just getting the time away/not using.)))  


  
So I went there, and the W/D's were hellish,   
I didn't sleep for a week straight, was borderline going nuts, psychosis like symptoms along with all of the pleasant physical/sleep symptoms that we all know and love. I ended up leaving 8 days in, because it was too much and not letting up. Also the program had been gutted due to COVID-19, we had tons of downtime, it just wasn't an environment that was helpful for me. Maybe I panicked and made a rash decision by leaving, but I knew what I was in for, and knew my limits as far as being able to follow (what was left of) the program/cope with the insane amount of stress and constant, incessant anxiety I was experiencing in the environment I was in.    - $3,000...  


So now, I'm in a position where I can either :  
1) Move back in with my old room mate, who doesn't use, and report a return to work date/get my FMLA paperwork filled out by my doctor, go back to working a job I hate without a car/ride or money saved up. It's not too far away so I'd just Uber/Lyft..  
or 

2) I can stay with my dad, and go to a free 3-6 month christian program that involves working/doing projects for the local communities and such? (My family's idea, not mine. We hold different spiritual beliefs)   
 I'm going to have to experience withdrawals and/or tapering (and PAWS) from where I am currently with my kratom use. As I said, I've been using still, though not as much as I was, it's still a significant amount. Need a scale..   


If you've had a multiple year, high amount abuse issue that you've found super difficult to address despite all kinds of negative effects, relationships lost, resources wasted, ect., ect. I'd like your opinion on this/opinion on what is the best course of action for a long term kratom addiction: tapering/working, or C/T while in a working program where you're active/have to work. I know that from this last time going C/T, I don't want to have to put my body and mind through that hell if at all avoidable.. I want to start making progress in my personal life/start making money again to address this medical debt, start having meaningful relationships with the people I care about and love dearly, but, am not sure on how to get there the fastest/most appropriate way.... Any experience or insight into the two methods/options would be much appreciated, as I don't have anyone to talk with this about who would understand/understands the nature of this addiction and the severity of the recovery process. Thank you!

Some of you are laughing at this point going really that's it? (its not a dick measuring contest) 

Some background on me. I am a 30y/o with a history of addiction started when i was 18 popping pills graduated to tar around 22 and eventually methadone till i was 25. During my bout with methadone i also became extremely addicted to alcohol. At 25 I entered a rehab spent 28 days there kicked a 120mg methadone habit while detoxing from alcohol it was hell but  really straightened out my life. I celebrated 5 years of no alcohol or methadone on jun 24 of this year.  

Back to subject at hand. A couple of weeks ago I injured my back while working out, the pain was relentless and i tried heat, ice, cbd, thc, otc meds nothing seemed to help. With the pandemic going on going to see the doctor has become even less appealing then even before so i decided fuck it whats a home remedy for pain. I had seen kratom advertised at headshops and knew very little about it but after a quick search sure as shit it will help with pain, at this point i see some minor warnings about it being habit forming but im in so much pain I only read what i want and go buy some capsules from local head shop. Took 3g first night and backpain gone i felt great, next day waited 24 hours and took 3g and waited a bit ened up taking anohter 1.5. I waited 24 each day to take my dose never exceeded 4.5 for the next week. 

First couple of days where great, back pain was gone, was playing with kid and dogs life was good. On day 4 days I was getting off of work and caught myself getting excited to go home to take my dose so i rushed home and took it and only then did i realize my back didn't even hurt anymore I was taking it just for the good feeling not for the pain. Like the addict i am i continued to take kratom for another 4 days continuing my 4.5gpd once per day in the evening. On the 9th day I woke up and instantly craved kratom. After all I had been through with previous addiction this was a ball buster I knew i had fucked up. I instantly went and flushed remaining capsules. I spent the rest of the day depressed out of my mind with no energy at all and kratom thoughts filled my head constantly. I was in withdraws but how? I had only been taking this for a week. The physical withdraws  have been very mild compared to other substances as many state but the mental game of this drug is strong, strong enough for me to see that while this plant may have some benefits for some it is not for me and after finally doing some real research and reading plenty of  post here on r/quittingkratom I see it would have only been a matter of time before i found myself at a much higher dose and dosing regularly I am a junkie by nature after all. So to all of you who put your gut wrenching stories on here about facing this demon Thank You for sharing. 

Sorry for the long post but I really needed to get this off my chest and I hope that I can see this as a reminder in future if I feel tempted to try again, but  also to help others that might be in a similar situation.

I realized real fast im gonna have to find a way to be off of the shots for at least a week before i take that again. Or if i do maybe i should only take 1.5ml.

But I had RLS, bowel issues, insomnia, anxiety. It just wasn’t good for me anymore. 

I’ve been having trouble peeing for months now. Like nearly a year, while I was on kratom. If I took a lot, it was nearly impossible to pee. If I took less, it was still difficult but I could pee if I concentrated and took a fee minutes, and it was like a dribble rather than a steady, pressured stream like it always was before. 

I know this is an issue that occurs with long time kratom use (I used for 2 years). I thought I’d be able to pee normally by now though, after a week+ has passed with no kratom.

Emphasis on mostly good days.","I’m at day 145. My last dose was a little over a gram on the evening of March 8. I didn’t even feel anything. It probably reset the withdrawal timeline though as I had been several weeks into a quit already.

I’m finding this quit is unique in many ways, probably due to the complex nature of Kratom (40 different alkaloids, apparently). Peoples experiences seem to vary, which makes sense since we are all slightly different. This has been my experience. 

I just want to offer it in hopes of helping someone get through. I am a part of the no matter what club! No more Kratom, no matter what! I hope you’ll join me!

I used (on and off) for about 2 years and my doses varied, but in any given day I would say I was taking anywhere between 6-12 grams, and sometimes more. When I was using, I was using more or less constantly. I would dose in the morning (2 pills ~ 1 gram) and again at mid day (4-6 pills, ~ 2-3 grams) and early evening (usually 4 pills ~ 2 grams). I was using Bali, but I believe that the strain is much less important than is emphasized, but that is just my opinion. I think when people start blaming different strains on certain effects they are simply in denial. And that’s my opinion. When I would stop taking Kratom even for a day, my nose would run constantly and I would become easily agitated. I didn’t like who I was becoming when I was off Kratom, and because I had no intention of using this shit for the rest of my life, it ultimately led me to quit. Sure, there was euphoria while using, but in my experience it came with diminishing returns. The days where I didn’t dose made me reassess the situation and realize that overall the coming down wasn’t worth the going up. I have quit this stuff before, with a slightly different withdrawal experience, however each time comes with common denominators for me. 

In this post I am going to focus on PAWS. Because, 1) they are real and 2) the majority of my withdrawal and the difficulty with it this time are related to PAWS and not the acute stage. To be clear, I have experienced clear acute withdrawals including panic attacks and literally kicking uncontrollably. However, most of us know what to expect at that stage and can muster the courage to just get through it. With this drug, the danger comes later when we’ve let our guard down. And the first step for me is to acknowledge that PAWS is real and it’s the reason most of us fall back to Kratom. 

PAWS for me consists of: Depersonalization, irritability, anxiety, depression, digestive issues, base-brain headaches, sinus pressure (mostly mild - a dull ache or tingling sensation). I have quit for ~ 3 month stints 2 or 3 times in the past few years of using. There seems to be something about the 3 month mark and going back, and I hope if you’re there (or near) you just hang in! It gets so much better! 

The lingering symptoms still come in waves, but if early sobriety was high tide, this is low tide. The symptoms are much less severe/debilitating and the waves come much less often. Everything has diminished over time. Everything is less demanding of my attention and more manageable. I’ve learned to ride the waves rather than get swept up under them. If I compare my anxiety to 5 months ago, the difference is incredible. I feel grateful for the lessened symptoms both in severity and duration. If I am feeling sorry for myself, I can make the lingering symptoms define my day. It has been important for me not to do that. Having nothing to do is often the worst thing for this. I have to force myself to get out, exercise, be around people, and get out of my own head. Ideally, by helping other people. Sometimes, I will say, that frustration comes in because I just want this to be over. Over over. And its not... yet. However, one doesn’t need to be a physician to know that when symptoms are slowly improving and becoming less severe and there are longer stretches of good days over time (and the good days far outweigh the bad), the condition is improving and there will come a day when there are no longer any symptoms at all. I am grateful for this thread as well, because there isn’t much information out there about this drug and it’s withdrawal. So instead of thinking “it couldn’t possibly still be the Kratom withdrawal, not after all this time!” and left to my own thoughts, I can read here that it likely is still lingering effects of Kratom withdrawal. This makes me feel that not only am I not losing my mind, but the opposite, I am regaining my mind! It also makes me feel that I’m not alone. 

I wanted to offer my experience to show my appreciation for this group and support it in the way it supports me. Hopefully someone will be helped by this. 

It also sometimes becomes difficult so far out to distinguish between depression/anxiety, say, caused by a pandemic and isolation and the incredibly unusual life circumstances we are all facing, and my brain simply resetting from long term use of a chemical. The truth is that there is some of both. My anxiety/depression/irritability are certainly more pronounced due to the new normal. There are times when I’m coming back from the grocery store, mask on, and I think: “What the fuck!!!” Haha. It’s surreal at times and this is likely normal for everyone to feel. 

I also need to say that I don’t judge anyone who decides to take self prescribed medicine for the rest of their lives. It’s just not for me. It can’t be. I struggle also with alcohol addiction and my life quickly becomes unmanageable in some form or another when using chemicals. And to be honest, I’ve been sober for long periods of time (from everything, for years) and I just felt better! Much less of the high highs and low lows and just more... centered and content and “good”. I wouldn’t trade it for the world to be honest. And I’m going for it again. 

I have observed that my symptoms tend to appear in waves, like I said, that they arrive together (teamwork!) and usually linger for only a few days (often 2-3 days). They “attack” from a variety of different systems. Different aspects are noticed at different times. Depersonalization and Digestive problems (gas, bloating, constipation and that feeling of having a pit in my stomach) are definitely correlated to the anxiety and irritability. I’m not sure which triggers the other and it is not important for me. They come together. Also, it is during these times that the strange, dull, base-brain “headaches” appear - they also come and go and have been fading over time in intensity. Early on I would get actual headaches (like wearing a headband) and sinus pressure along with a runny nose, but the runny nose is completely gone and these remaining symptoms are incredibly mild and it is more like: I am more aware of my sinuses/brain right now. It’s a stretch to even call it a headache. There is also some tingling sensation in my brain and sometimes in my face. This has also lessened greatly over time. 

The important thing for me to remember through all of this, is that I am going through Kratom withdrawal. Kratom withdrawal is complex and non-linear in my experience (and others have also said this). Likely, what I am experiencing is real and it is normal for symptoms to linger. I try not to get on WebMD and diagnose myself with a variety of illnesses that aren’t Kratom withdrawal. I try to remember that I have improved a lot since day 1. A lot a lot. I try to keep things in the day and stay busy and connected to other people. I accept that it will take as long as it takes and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel (and it is much closer and brighter than 145 days ago!) 

I force myself to exercise, because especially when I am having anxiety or any symptoms, it helps a lot. I try to get out and be around other people as often as I can (as is possible during these times). Days off from work are the hardest to be honest, because I have nothing but time and I’m single and live alone. Isolation is not good for this quit, whatever stage I’m in. 12 step groups (on zoom) have been a godsend! You can be in LA in the evening and Berlin in the morning. And there are tons of meetings every hour. I haven’t found anything specific for Kratom (I wish there was) but addiction is all basically the same imho. If you want more information about this feel free to reach out. 

I just wanted to offer my experience to anyone out there who is struggling and feeling alone. You’re not crazy! You’re getting more sane by the second! You’re not alone! Keep that in the back of your mind and things will be much much easier. In my experience this chemical is much more powerful than I gave it credit for, and stay here for real information about what it’s like. I, like many of us, got caught up in the misinformation and downplaying of the negative effects. “Kratom withdrawal last about 45 minutes and is on par with skipping breakfast.” Fuck you it is! Haha. Stay with this group, otherwise you’re going to be fed misinformation or told that you aren’t experiencing what you’re experiencing or people will try to make you feel isolated for having the experience you are having. With no clear data, all experiences should be treated as valid. Don’t listen to anyone who has no plan to quit using. How could their opinion possibly be valid with such different intentions? Many of those people are just afraid to go through what you’re currently going through and feel their access to their drug is threatened somehow by real information. I’m also not trying to start a debate or argument, and I don’t care if Kratom is illegal or legal. Alcohol is legal and I need to avoid that in the same way. It’s everywhere. I’m writing to the person who is baffled by the lingering effects. You’re not alone and you’re not crazy! Kratom withdrawal takes some time. It requires, for me, patience and not beating myself up for not being miraculously better. It requires that I learn to ride the waves and trust the process. It means that I need to focus on the big picture and overall improvement (celebrate the little wins) and not dwell on a bad day or two (which is only happening around every 2 weeks now). It’s much much better than before, and I am ready to accept it taking as long as it takes. I won’t be going back. No matter what! I hope you will join me. And thanks for reading.

I connected the dots that drinking tonight made me feel bad tomorrow. Same thing with any other substance I tried. but kratom is especially sneaky to people like me. It doesn't ""seem"" elicit. It's marketed as borderline vitamin or ""health-food"". There's a cult of people raving about how great it is. And it certainly does make you feel great. For an hour at least. It's effects never lasted very long. So I was driven to take little bits of it throughout the day, in an attempt to keep my daily dose ""low"". But honestly I think that was worse than taking a big heaping dose in the morning. My body quickly got used to having little 1g doses every hour or 2. And then before long I was waking up at 8am in withdrawal. Then 7am. Then 6am. Then 5am. Even though I took it right before bed as late as 11pm.

23 days out from quitting phenibut (2.5-5 grams per day over 5.5 months or so)

13 days out from quitting kratom (harder to put numbers to, but heavy/daily use of 6-8(+) grams 4-5 times per day varying up and down for about 1.5 years)

I'm prescribed pregabalin for nerve pain and currently take 150 mg's 2x per day (as prescribed), but upped my usage during both withdrawals, and only seemed to hurt my tolerance a bit actually. From what I can tell, that has helped me immensely through the phenibut shit, but nonetheless, both my GABA receptors and opioid receptors are simultaneously cranky at times and throw me some fits. I am through the thick of both acute WD's and am keeping a pretty good head on my shoulders/staying positive despite the mental stuff from quitting both, but the hardest thing for me to push through is just how god damn weighed down my body feels all the freakin time. I know I feel better when I get up and moving (especially outside), but that's exactly the hardest thing for me to get doing at times. It's like this paradoxical thing that I'm aware of, but even with my awareness to it, I still struggle to do exactly what I know is best for me. Guess the physical goes with the mental. And seems my depression creeps back in at times, not helping things. Hot-cold showers and epsom salt baths have been great, but moving into a new apartment soon where I'll be sharing one bathroom with 2 other people, so will likely not be able to take baths as often. Been up on my electrolytes and supplements, seeming to help quite a bit. And taking some other stuff to help with my mood and bouts of anxiety.

But yeah, basically I'm wondering if anyone with similar experiences as me with dosage/etc could share timelines/etc, specifically with the lingering physical stuff? Still get random bouts of shakey legs/rls, but it's been less and less.

And yeah, I'm wondering if anybody has suggestions for healthier habits/exercises to replace these two habits? I was working out before, but have had a hard time sticking to it since kicking these habits (and supposed to be doing physical therapy daily for my back, which I've been mostly ignoring..). Thinking of some workouts/stretching I could perhaps do first thing in the morning to get me going perhaps. One big thing I'm wondering is if I'm better off sticking to cardio at this point? Like will doing some body weight squats and that stuff just make my legs feel sore on top of what I'm already pushing through? Seems skateboarding is calling pretty strongly to me. Think it offers a good combo of workout, self-expression, freedom, focus, and a nice adrenaline rush to help me through. It's the most working out I've been able to bring myself to doing lately. Music, writing, and connection seem to be things I really need rn as well. Anyway, I gotta move out this week and move lots of heavy things and my car just broke down and my back hurts and people suck sometimes and timing is a bitch, but if I get my body feeling better, I know I'll be good.

The acutes weren't as horrible as I thought they would be. I built them up in my head to be so much worse, which is why I put off quitting for so long. RLS was the worst part of the acutes for me (that crawling in your skin/can't ever get comfortable feeling.) 

PAWS, which I'm still dealing with, is getting much easier. For me, it is definitely the worst part of quitting this crap.

I used it for 6 years of my life. When I quit I was messed up, severely depressed, terrible sleep, no motivation, just a mess. Around day 20 is when I felt the withdraws were over. But didn’t start to feel like myself til about day 30. From there I slowly started to get better and better. I heard so many people say they were back to being 100% after a month or two, but that wasn’t the case for me. The only lingering issue I have is sleep, but I had bad insomnia before I ever did Kratom so I’m not entirely sure if Kratom is to blame. But even so, I am still getting at least 7 hours on most nights. 
But the main reason why I came here is so say that I am finally feeling good. It took 4 months for me, but I feel so much better. And there are people that have been clean for a year that say the same thing, the more time that passes the better we feel. This just goes to show that recovery from Kratom isn’t some quick thing. It can take up to 2 years for us to feel 100% again. Some people might bounce back quicker than others, but if you’re one of those people that’s at 1, 2, or 3 months clean and still feel bad, don’t lose hope. Your time will come and you’ll be glad you stayed clean.

And a final bit of advice. Exercise. I highly recommend prioritizing cardio. Aim for 20+ minutes a day. I personally started the couch to 5k program a few months back and it helped me a lot. The more you exercise the quicker you’ll recover I think. Just be careful not to injure yourself, if you’ve been sedentary for a long time you’ll need to work your way into exercise slowly. It’s a marathon not a sprint.   

Also, make sure not to indulge in any other substances, the key to success is staying 100% clean. Don’t pick up smoking, or drinking, or caffeine, etc.. clean yourself up completely.  I bounced from 1 thing to another for 13 years. This recent quit was the first time ever that I didn’t bounce to something else as a crutch.  My only choice was to make exercise a part of my life as that is the best way to get a natural high that’s good for you.",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.585379}"

Lasted over 2 months CT after a 50-100 GPD habit that lasted months.... worst depression of my life for a month after, not to mention that it ended up searing a hole in my stomach (22 years old with a stomach ulcer..). I felt so good eating healthy and exercising like a nut... Felt like I could finally write something halfway coherent, could focus on a book or a movie, had genuine interest in life... Didn't feel depressed or retarded, felt clean and clear headed. Why'd I go back?

Well now I'm in rehab.... I relapsed on alcohol and kratom at the same time, was also using a bunch of other hard drugs sporadically. Ended up doing meth, smoking crack, did suboxone and heroin too. The stomach ulcer got so bad that I couldn't keep any alcohol down and I was seriously addicted to that, so I went to Etizolam instead. During the last month I tried to go detox at a hospital 5 times and only ended up going through with a detox twice. I ended up taking that damn coronavirus test 5 times and that's something I wouldn't wish on anyone.

Shit got bad real quick and deep down I knew I had to change, so I accepted going to this rehab facility covered by Medicaid (it's not the best but i have a good amount of freedom here which is great). Hospital sent me home for a few days before rehab so I did as much Etizolam and Kratom as I could. So ended up having withdrawal off of both. Oh, and I stopped my Wellbutrin and Prozac. I feel like death. Seriously right now I just want to crawl in a hole and never come out. I really hate myself right now. I'm considering leaving just because I feel so awful and hopeless but my parents don't want to take me back... who can blame them? This place is hours away from my home too and a Lyft ride back would cost hundreds. I have very little money right now, it would ruin me. And Medicaid won't pay for it if I don't complete it, so I know I'm fucked if I leave. I feel awful but I gotta accept it, ride this out and just try to get better...

After 2 weeks I slowly started to feel better. Energy levels increasing, better sleep(albeit I’m still on ambien), and feeling actual emotions!

I don’t have any of the serious side effects from using like some people do: no hair loss, stomach problems or sleep disturbances. If I did I think it might be easier for me to quit, but maybe not. The reason why I want to quit is because I want to feel life again.  I feel nothing while on Kratom: no joy, no anticipation of what’s to come, no real motivation. I hope to get myself over the hump of PAWS so that I can feel things again and lose the desire to turn back.

Somewhere around 3 to 6 teaspoons a day whatever that it is in grams.  I decided to quit for a variety of reasons.  

1. to prove that I can
2. To see how the grass is on the other side (kratom definitely doesn't help like it once did and I refuse to drastically increase the dosage. It's really hard to tell at this point what it does since I was always on it but I think it more or less just kept me at a normal baseline without many positive effects.)
3. Health-wise I'm sure it's better to not take something daily
4. Tired of being tied to dosing it every 4-6 hours, every day was planned around dosing.
5. Financially I can afford it but I'd rather save the expense.
6. I'm afraid it's fucking me up mentally in some subtle but harmful ways
7. I've had dry skin lately and I think that may be related to Kratom

&#x200B;

It did help me in the beginning, primarily (or at least I thought) with anxiety/depression.  In hindsight though I think all it really did was numb emotional pain.  Being in a state of constant numbness to the world was addicting, why face problems head on when you can just bask in in a blanket of sedative comfort.  I want to start improving my life more and I have a hunch that will be harder always taking Kratom.

Anyways, on to the quitting.  My last does was on Friday 7/31 where I took one teaspoon around 9am.  Withdrawal wise any physical symptoms are extremely minor and nothing like the stories you read on here.  I had a minor headache I took some ibuprofen for but that's about it.  Psychologically though and I could be wrong about this being caused by Kratom but I basically had a mild panic attack when I more or less never get those.  Since quitting I can't stop thinking about dying one day and Nihilism and the tragedy of the human condition.  It spiked on Friday Night and part of Saturday and now I feel mildly better but it's still there.

I moved out of state and got a new job and I didn’t want to bring the habit with me so I stopped for 2 months. I felt okay but my life still felt off at 2 months. 

About a month after living in a new state, I decided to try Kratom again to help my confidence and productivity at work. “I will keep it in control this time” I said.. And I somewhat did, never exceeding 2 grams 3x a day. But it was still daily nonetheless. About a month ago, I started tapering .2 grams every 2 weeks or so until I was down to 1g like once a day. I just flew back home to visit family and friends. Took my last 1g dose before I left. 

I was just dumped by my girlfriend, I am very lonely in my new state, and I am going through tests for an unrelated medical issue all at the same time right now. Even though my dose was so low, and doesn’t compare to some of yours, my god it still fucking hurts. My symptoms are all mental, but I can physically feel my crippling anxiety in my stomach and chest. All of my emotions on all these matters hit me full force like a truck all at once. It’s so fucking overwhelming but i’m doing okay. 

My breakup was largely due to Kratom use, which makes me feel so incredibly guilty. I would go into opioid rage often times. I was neglecting my girlfriends feelings and needs.

I stopped dosing yesterday around noon and woke up with that all to familiar ickyness, prickly skin, anxious lethargy that we junkies have come to recognize as the all to familiar withdrawal. Now, 2 weeks at 20-30 gpd really isnt all that much. Long enough to acquire a physical dependence but not so long that this is gonna be sanything near my previous experiences.

My husband of 20 years has been using kratom for around 3 years at least. I didn't pay attention at first because he buys it locally in a store, and it's not illegal or anything,  so how bad could it be. He claimed to use it to treat IBS and said it worked wonders, and to be fair it really does seem to help with the IBS.

However he's become more and more withdrawn, spending all his free time in front of his computer, just surfing. He's no longer interested in doing things around the house, and has become withdrawn from family, and from me. Our sex life is non existent.  We haven't had anything like sex in almost a year. I stopped bringing up sex because he seems not only uninterested, but put-upon. Like the idea of sex is too tedious or I'm somehow overbearing and unattractive. It's made me reach out to other guys for validation, to seek reassurance that I'm still attractive and desirable.  I'm alarmed because we've been together for over 20 years and I dont want to cheat or leave him. 

He buys and goes through 2 kilo bags every month, at least. He routinely takes between 4 to 6 heaping tablespoons of powder 2 or 3 times a day, every day. He doesn't measure so it's hard to know exactly how much he's taking, but I suspect that's an underestimation. I've watched as he withdraws from us more and more, and his consumption just skyrockets. He is a recovering alcoholic who hasn't had a drink in almost a decade so the addiction potential is definitely there.

I found some 5 mg melatonin and wanted to give that a try. Anyone else have experience with this? Or anything else that could help? Thanks in advance and I’m truly grateful to this community.

2020-08-02 06:55:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/i2a83p/feeling_lost_and_alone/,Feeling lost and alone,"I am almost 30 years old now. A functioning addict doing \*reasonably\* well at my profession. I have been using opiates for 15 years now. I started using Tramadol at age 15. I managed to get clean once with the help of a psychiatrist about three years back. He put me on Gabapin, Baclofen, SSRIs and some anti-psychotics. As soon as I started doing okay I stopped going to him for followups. I stopped with all the meds except for Gabapin and Baclofen and started smoking weed again. Fast forward a few years and I was back to taking tramadol. I developed an addiction to Modafinil and caffein as well to keep myself functioning at work. I started using Kratom as well in the hope of weaning out the opiates but I would fall back to Tramadol every time I would run out. I also developed a nasty habit of watching porn and masturbating every single day just to avoid the anxiety of dealing with life.

During the last few months I have managed to cut everything out since I no longer had work. I am living with my parents but they don't know that I am still taking Kratom. They are very supportive otherwise. All I am taking now is 100mg of Gabapin a day (weaned off slowly) and some THC/CBD capsules and Kratom. I have planned to quit the THC/CBD as well since I am starting graduate school online this week so I have none left. But I am running out of Kratom as well now. I have only enough to last me 10-12 days and I cannot get more. I have an exam to write in 20 days and am lagging behind after having taken a week to quit caffein. I am scared. I wish I had gone cold turkey for a few days earlier to reset my tolerance and then taper off with smaller doses (just read about this method today). I don't want to go back to using other substances, especially opiates again. I know that I am on the right path but I am feeling lost. I have Clonidine and Aswagandha which I have been using to help with the Gabapin taper. I have been exercising regularly  and will fix my diet as well and cut out sugars and needless junk that slows me down. 

I have just cut down to 6-8 small teaspoons a day. Last night I woke up in the middle of the night with withdrawals after having slept without taking any. I managed to pass out with some clonidine, valerian root and melatonin.

Just don't know where to go from here and I really don't want to use opiates again. I don't want to drop the ball on my studies and exams because I will be taking a loan from my parents to study. Should I start taking Modafinil again?

I know my situation is much better than a lot of addicts but this is my very own private hell. I know I've come a long way but this is going to be the hardest hill to climb.

I guess my question is, will this just get worse and worse? It's very strange and I'm extremely confused based on previous experience going down this road.

I feel the need to articulate on here where I am and where I'm going to kind of get footing as to where I am in the quitting process. Thank you in advance to anyone who reads this all I really appreciate your time!

 I kind of wanted to create a new account to start posting on here again because if you look at my profile you will see I have been coming and going from this sub for over a year now which embarrasses me since I'm still trying to quit and struggling to figure it out. But I decided to stick with this account because I know I will successfully quit and then my profile can just be its own journey and proof that even if you are struggling hard its possible. (I know a lot of people can relate to this already I've read some powerful post. Extremely grateful for this Sub). Last thing I want to add before getting to the nitty-gritty  is right now I am tapering from roughly 40-50GPD. I am currently at 30gpd and hoping to get serious on a rapid taper. Because while yes I have made progress...I know I can make more progress faster. I have already done it so I know its possible.

&#x200B;

 So here is what I really wanted to share. Its a lecture I translated to text to help me really embody the message.  I am a believer that writing important stuff down greatly improves how much you will remember compared to just listening. (especially with my current kratom brain) 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 

PART ONE...... Take the time to answer these questions. 

Write it all down. 

You will never hit a target if you never aim at it OR know what it is. 

First lets first specify exactly what you want so we have a target to aim at.

What do you want from yourself(physically, mentally, emotionally)? 

Who do you want to be? What do you want to do? 

What do you want from your family? Your friends? Your Career?  

How would you like to use your time outside of work?

Why is this what you want? You will know why if you really ask.

Take the next 10-15 min to  write out now what your life could be if you could obtain everything you wanted in the next 10 years. You want to get clear on where you are going.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The best way to do this is to just write. Don't care about grammar or wording.  Writing down your thoughts will help you better articulate them. Its getting the blueprints to the house. The Directions on the map.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

PART TWO... 

take the next 10-15 min now to write out what your life could/would be like if you let all your weakness of character, and your susceptibility  to temptation and error fully manifest its self and take you out.  

Now you have a detailed picture of the promise land, also a detailed picture of hell. Which will give you all the reason to climb up the mountain to the promise land and all the reasons to run the hell away from hell.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your wrestling with addiction part of the problem is your not thinking it through.  Because no matter how bad it is now, it's no where near how bad its going to get.  And that's a PIT. It's not only going to take you, it's going to take you and your family. And its going to take everything you could have offered to the community.  And it's going to tear you into bits.  Which it will do in its own particular and pernicious way. A way that you already know.  So if you write all this down, and you really let your imagination run.  Tell yourself ""Okay I'm going to drop the lies for a minute to do this."" . 

Because as we all know lying is very much associated with addiction.  Let me try to articulate that some.

You see when someone is addicted to a drug, such as Kratom-- they are technically **Dopamine agonists** (DA)--definition--( are medications that work by imitating the actions of **dopamine** when levels are low. These medications improve condition-related symptoms by fooling the brain into thinking **dopamine** is available) .  

In other words, Dopamine is the neurochemical that produces hope, excitement, interest, pleasure. All of those things. And every time we take a drug we flood our dopamine system.  (hence why we lack all these feelings getting sober because our body adapted to those huge spikes we would give it dosing and since that is gone now our body needs to relearn how to get it naturally. length and amount of use will play a big factor here) 

&#x200B;

So here is the scenario we all know too well...

We start to experiment with Kratom. And it appears to works great for awhile, improving multiple aspects of life with seemingly little to no side effects at first. Some become more social, able to get off heavier drugs easily, daily chronic pain has gone away, overall feeling of bliss from the euphoria, etc.  But as you journey from weekly use to daily use you start noticing you need more to get the same desired effect. As you increase your dose you also start to increase the frequency of your dose's to because you notice you start getting these crashes and if you dose sooner then you can avoid the crashes.  This is when you start to really lie to yourself. You know that you shouldn't do it, but then you give yourself a bunch of reason's why it's okay to do it just this once.  So you then take the Kratom.

What the problem with this?

Well dopamine makes you feel good, and our brain is designed to want to feel good, at pretty much all costs. So when we have something release dopamine, especially large amounts. Our brain will neurologically back track what structures and actions we took to achieve that.  So that makes it so those neurological structures that achieved that will get stronger. It will grow. Literally. It's like watering a plant. (hence why the longer you are addicted the harder it is to quit)

But this is an awful plant. It's a weed. A black weed.  Because its made out of lies. Its made out of the lies tell yourself so you can continue to justify heading down that path.  Every time you take that dose. You tell yourself a lie... and it grows a little bit...and grows a little bit..  this is a very invasive weed to..because as it grows and has the capacity to suppress everything else. 90% can do only thing at a time regardless how much we claim to be multitaskers.  So when you are locked onto to something, then the thing that your locked onto suppresses everything else that you could be attended to.

So you are basically building a monster inside your head. A monster that only wants the drug and its alive. and every time you dose it grows.  

To summarize you need a life worth living more than the drug. And you need to know what that looks like.

Because if your addicted you are probably very susceptible to the drug. 

So really ask yourself. What do I need to do with my life, so it would be rich and meaningful enough to stop using the drug anymore. Because if you cant find an answer to this question.  You will always lie to yourself justifying why the drug is the best option.",12,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.64714575}"

I just feel sick and exhausted and everything hurts. The depression hasnt gone away, even when i had the relapse. I still dont feel like myself at all.

I've suffered from chronic back pain (arthritis?) For nearly 2 years now and haven't been able to give my dogs (60-75 pounds each) the proper exercise they need and deserve. When I was in the throws of Kratom addiction, sad to admit and say, I could more easily ignore this major flaw I had as a responsible dog owner (and lover). Even now, especially in the evening and nighttime hours, there are days where physically I can barely handle taking the two of them out for a short walk and to do their business. When I was still using, I resounded myself to the fact that I could only handle one of them at a time outside. Very shortly after I quit, I began to feel good enough to start taking them *both* out together again... most days. This morning I took them both out as per usual now, and my older dog (who only has 3 legs, yet manages extremely well for shorter time periods) wanted to go back inside before my younger, my energetic, Pitty. This is not unusual, so I put him in. I started walking down the street with the younger guy. And kept walking. Before we knew it, we were around the corner... then to the next block. The choice now was to turn around and go home... Or to make it a slightly longer outing and go all the way around the block. We kept on going. The last 25% or so of the trip was a bit tough, for both of us. (I started taking longer deeper breaths which seemed to help.) But we made it back home safe together. This may not seem like a big deal for most ""normal"" folks; but taking my boys for a 30 minute walk 43+ days ago, while in the zombie world of Kratom addiction, was unheard of... Not just because of my pain issues, but motivationally speaking as well. My Pit has stopped panting now and has that goody pit bull happy grin on his face. Man, I missed that goofy grin. I'm sorry Boys, Daddy will keep getting better. Thanks to this sub reddit and no longer believing the lies Kratom used to tell me.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48605016}"

I sort of accidentally quit 4 days ago after running out and didn’t expect to withdrawal like this. My use started in the last couple of years from being occasionally during the week, to daily, to multiple times a day. I honestly don’t know how much I was using, as I didn’t really count or weigh. Bad, I know. I just used and used and used.

This has been really hard to wrap my head around. I had to leave home after my mom’s alcoholism got out of control as a teen. I did really well in HS and college, was actually just a credit away from graduating. I needed a place to stay to finish that last semester, and my uncle ended up inviting me to stay and then kicking me out a couple weeks later. I honestly didn’t do anything, and he wasn’t even living in his house or in the state, but he’s ex military and would call me and just lay into me every single day about needing a 5 year plan, how he wanted me to type it and send it to him, step by step breakdown of how I would do each thing I needed to do (get my license, finish my credit, getting a job). It was a lot, and I’m crying just thinking about that time. I’d just agree and apologize. After some weeks of that, he said I had to leave because he was doing me no favors. This was really hard, because I grew up with an abusive mother, did my best, made dean’s list every semester. This is when my kratom use upped and upped, because I was exhausted, depressed, busy packing and unpacking and packing again, moving stuff in trips to a city 3 hours away.

&#x200B;

Here I am 3 years later, and I feel like this time just slipped away. I spent one year staying with my SO, not working, extremely depressed after things with my uncle, crippled by anxiety and PTSD. Having dreams about my mom, dreams about his calls/emails, never sleeping. Kratom upped to daily use. Then I worked a year at an awful restaurant, trying to save for a car. Then another year at another restaurant. Then we had a house fire after a lightning strike. Here I am, almost 27, and I feel like a failure for letting this happen and being addicted. I feel like I’ve neglected all of my relationships, even my dog (I haven’t—she’s fine and spoiled, but I haven’t given her enough focused attention and she’s coming up on 12 and I’m so upset at myself).   


I began abusing adderall. Both together, worried for my health. I’m still worried for my health, long term. Is my heart ok? Liver, kidneys? Did I royally fuck my heart up using these two drugs for this long like this?

&#x200B;

The first 3 days felt AWFUL. Last night was worse than the night before. But today, despite sleeping 3 hours, I woke up with so much more clarity than I have had in years. Which is why it hit me so hard that I’ve probably robbed myself of time and productivity. I know it’ll be ok, I’ll get shit done that needs doing, not to be too hard on myself, but I keep beating myself up and then shying away from it because the guilt is too much.",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.69472337}"

I couldn’t find many sources online to help with my issue. So I am posting here. My boyfriend, we’ve been together about a year now, has been addicted to kratom for the past four years now. He was taking 12 grams, every three hours until we met. He told me about it the second or third time we hung out, and I did some research. I talked with him about cutting down and he’s been back and fourth on it. Overall he is cutting down which I am proud of. But the main issue I am struggling with is how to handle his mood swings from it, along with his denial of his mood swings. He gets very irritable and lacks any patience and gets majorly upset with just about any inconvenience about 20 min before he has to take his next dose (about 2.5 hours after his last dose) and it is a very repetitive problem. Any time we argue, he is ALWAYS taking kratom 10 minutes later. And every time we argue, I do recognize my own faults in each argument but I feel like they are extremely minor compared to how he reacts. I feel like there isn’t even room for me to apologize for anything I’ve done compared to how he flips out. I want to, but the balance is just so fucked up because of how he reacts to every issue. We almost never argue when he’s not “waiting to take his next dose” (he waits a minimum of three hours because he says his vision gets fucked up and he feels nauseous if he doesn’t wait three hours between each dose), and if I do ever get unreasonably upset, I always apologize and everything is fine within a few minutes. So I know we are capable of that but it just seems with kratom his mood is just not compatible with anything I can say or do. I keep asking him when he thinks he will be able to cut down more (he’s down to 6.5 grams per dose, *trying* to decrease by .5 each week) and it just seems like it’s not going to happen. I just know if he could get it out of his life for good, that he would be able to look back at this and realize how much kratom has fucked up his life and his relationship. I love him more than I’ve ever loved anything and I can’t imagine being without him. Like I said, the majority of our arguments stem either directly or indirectly from kratom, so taking that out completely would help us tremendously I know it. His whole life revolves around when he can take kratom next. He has to plan out every time he leaves the house at a time 20 mins before he can take his next dose so that it has time to kick in before he has to deal with any sort of social activity. He is so controlled by it but I don’t know how to help him see it. He just denies everything I try to help him see. It is obviously (and can’t deny) that he is physically addicted to it and that he can’t continue to afford it and those are his only motivations for why he is cutting back now. Does anyone else have any experience with having help from a significant other or helping their own significant other with getting off of kratom? Sorry that had to be so long. It’s just such a complex issue and i don’t have any experience with these types of addictions (just alcoholism in my own family).

Anyway the honeymoon lasted 3 months then kratom stopped working and I had to take breaks all the time and I was hiding it from a lot of people around and it started to be my only concern and a source of stress. I also was messing with a lot of nootropics and phenibut on my kratom breaksand I wasnt proud of myself anymore!

I don’t know if it’s really hit me yet. It really has been years since I’ve done this. Years. It doesn’t seem real. I’ve had flashes throughout the last week of serious new mental clarity but it hasn’t been super consistent. For the most part though, I feel pretty darn good. Occasionally I do think about dosing, but I try to rip that thought from my head immediately. The last time I quit (years ago), my downfall was convincing myself that I could enjoy in moderation again , and look where that led me. I believe this will be the next tough challenge.

I usually took my last dose at midnight and then not again until I woke up at 6-6:30AM. I haven’t been waking up feeling like shit in a while, so I planned to take my last dose last night and wake up today and not take any. I slept through the initial withdrawals.

I have had a few nights where I toss and turn in bed all night and never fall asleep, my brain just won't shut off.  I have anxiety so I'm sure this is the root.  However, recently I got so desperate that I decided to drink a few glasses of wine to hopefully at least ""pass out"" for a few hours.  Well that didn't go so well, not only did the alcohol make me nauseous, I didn't get any sleep and just felt hungover and sleep deprived the whole next day.  I have done this twice now and same thing has occurred.  I used to get a nice happy buzz while drinking before I took kratom, is that all changed now?  I'm a social drinker (who can be a binge drinker under the right circumstances) and didn't plan on going teetotal but now I'm thinking maybe I will be forced to?
