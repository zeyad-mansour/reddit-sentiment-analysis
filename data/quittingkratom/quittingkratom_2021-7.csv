Like many of you, I've taken many attempts to get off this shit. 
On Monday I called a local rehab place to get info. They did my initial assessment over the phone. I'm waiting on a call back to talk cost, insurance info and set up an in person assessment. 

I'm thinking the lowest 1-2 day a week 3 hour per session to start. The assessor said he isn't the one doing the assessment from this conversation, but said the plan on them probably asking me to do the 5 day a week program. I'm not saying I'm not Hella addicted, but that's a bit much for real life. We'll see, I'm open to it, but not before I try lighter option.

Questions
Anyone do this? 
Did it help?
Thoughts or comments?
Was it just a group class? Or some one on one? I'm not sure yet on my end. 
Anything I should expect? 
They teach total abstinence, which is fine. But I'm not dropping my pure cbd weed, yes no thc. Quitting thc is no issue, I don't like it. I'm all for no more drinking, I've pretty much snuffed this issue already, but still could be an issue when I drop kratom. Kratom is by far and above the issue (or any opioid if I came across them, which is steer clear mostly) 

Guess I'm just looking for thoughts on this. Just looking for further support than my wife, someone to keep me in check. As well as learn coping mechanisms to get me past a month or two. Where I have failed many times.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53880167}"
2021-07-30 22:11:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ouytp9/12_year_user_10_year_daily_its_time/,"12 year user - 10 year daily, it's time","Started in 2009 (can't believe it's been 12 yrs) for back pain from a major car accident. Controlled use for 2 years. Caught that euphoria and spiraled into daily use.

Fast forward to 2015, I went cold turkey. RLS was the worst by far but did go away about 3 weeks. I actually felt euphoric about 3rd or 4th day quiting which likely kept me motivated. Unfortunately the dreaded boredom bug caught me and I went back on it.

Fast forward to today, I've started a relationship with someone I really like and the feeling is mutual. This has made me realize I can't be a good person in a relationship when kratom will sit in the back of my mind and I'll have to constantly worry about redosing to starve off withdrawals.

I know the reason isn't a proper one but it has got me realizing I've got to fix this not only to have a healthy relationship but for myself. Kratom is the reason I was single for 10 years, I knew no one wants to date an addict so I stayed that way on purpose and always pushed interested people away.

So the plan for me is taper this time. Reason being is I cannot afford to be non-functional for a few weeks. I've already dropped doses about 50% and so far I have had little withdrawals, in fact right now I feel more clear headed and functional. I bought one last 200 cap bottle, I am down to 6 capsules 3x per day. I plan on Sunday to drop it to 4. Next Sunday down to 2 and finally quit.

The only thing that's going to set me back is usually emotional pain or boredom. Is there any suggestions in regards to handling triggers?

I've done this before and I can do it again. Kratom has been both a great asset for pain (including emotional) and energy but at this point it has no magic, I'm taking it to feel ""normal"" which seems to include irritability that I didn't have before.

Any tips or encouragement would be great. I know RLS will likely eventually rear it's ugly head but I do have trazadone to help knock me out for short term. I used Ambien last time but I don't have that anymore.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46513358}"

I talked to my Dr about having persistent rls and asked for gabapentin as a first line treatment. With this visit I was able to secure gabapentin 1200mg at night and Ambien (it made me sleep walk and sleep eat) so I switched over to lunesta 3mg at bed.

1 tbs of black seed oil 4x a day which helps pretty well
10000mg of vitamin c powder. Don't really know if it's helping but why not?

Restless legs Imho is the worst part of quitting. 

I was at a 60g a day habit and before quitting completely was able to taped down to 45mg with the help of using 600mg capsules as opposed to using a tbs of powder. If you have any questions please ask. I have been off Kratom now for about 6 months.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5112691}"

I’m started noticing how much money it was costing while I was home during the Covid Shutdown and have been trying to quit. I did well at first then out of nowhere I started taking more then I originally was, now I’m back to where I was. I quit alcohol CT after doing it daily for about 17 years over a year ago and quit cigarettes slowly over a few weeks after about 8 years a long time ago but this seems to be much harder. I’m about to have a boy in January and determined to quit before that but after last time I don’t think CT is going to work for me unless I can stay home for a couple weeks which is not financially possible. So I’ve decided to try a long taper method, if anyone has done this if they could give me an idea of what they did it would be greatly appreciated.

I used for 4.5 years and have tried and failed to CT dozens of times over that time period. This time I tapered for a few months beforehand, and it finally stuck. The cravings have been minimal. I was triggered a couple of times, but I recognized what was happening and shut that shit down before I went into the autopilot mode that always, always leads to a relapse. 

I had to make some changes after quitting in order to feel like I can manage this quit long term. I got back into shape before I started tapering and have been running consistently and eating healthy. I am positive that running has sped up the healing process. It was really hard to run in the first few weeks because I was depressed and lethargic from quitting, but I forced myself to go for short, easy runs and am now running 4-5 miles a day. I also started going to therapy. My therapist is the only person who I have been able to discuss my addiction with because I hid it from everyone. I now realize the reasons I started using in the first place and am taking a healthier approach to dealing with those issues.

I am still terrified of relapse because I’ve done it so many times, but this is the furthest I’ve ever made it, and I feel like a different person. I actually feel like a better person than I was pre-kratom: healthier, more self aware and more empathetic. 

Quitting kratom might be the hardest thing you ever do, but it doesn’t have to be a terrible experience. Making the decision to quit shows that you value your life enough to want to live it more fully. Find out who you are again and what brings you joy. Allow yourself time to grieve this chapter of your life, and be thankful for whatever it taught you. But also keep reminding yourself that this chapter is over, and a new one is on the horizon. 

As far as taper vs. CT, I didn’t realize how many steps there are to fully committing to quitting, which is why I failed with the CT approach. I would set a quit date and then just hope for the best, but nothing ever really changed, so I always went back. Whatever your approach, I hope you do it, and I hope you do it for good. It’s so worth it. Kratom is a garbage drug that we all have the power to leave behind.",6,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5099239}"

I’d hate to bore you with redundancy, because i know there are a lot of quit journals out there, but I really want to put this down in writing so to speak, so that I can refer back to it someday.

Kratom came into my life back in 2012. I was a former opiate addict and googled “natural anxiety remedies” and BOOM I knew I had to try it. The first time I tried some capsules it was like taking my first Vicodin. I felt warm and safe and happy.

I took k for about 2 years after that, then quit, suffering horrid withdrawals. I said NEVER again. 

But then back in 2019, I was going through a really rough patch in life. I was living with my mom, and there was this smoke shop next door. I walked there in about 5 mins and walked out with a backpack FULL of the shit I swore I’d never touch again. 

I almost immediately graduated to daily use. And my GPD were so high that I had to start rotating shops, because they were looking at me like a junkie. I basically was.

I was unemployed at the time because I was being treated for severe bipolar disorder, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t find ways to lie and cheat my mom out of money so that I could get my fix. I was so disgusted with myself. What kind of fucking person does that?

But a few months ago I realized that kratom had no value whatsoever to me anymore. There was no euphoric high. Social anxiety to the max. And I couldn’t go anywhere because I always had to plan my doses around the people I loved not seeing it.

Finally, a few weeks ago I started a rapid taper from 26 gpd.  After the first week I was hurting, but I needed it to be over. Forever. Here is my diary from this time period:


Day one - I spent this entire day crying. Ugly crying. Because I’d tapered quickly, I had already been experiencing many of the withdrawal symptoms, and I hadn’t slept at all the night before. 

Bad thoughts consumed my mind and I couldn’t force myself not to ruminate on them. The guilt I felt for having lied to my family was too much to bear. I didn’t sleep one wink that night. RLS was a slight electric tingle throughout.

Days 2-3 - I spent these days in bed. Barely ever leaving it. I stopped eating because I couldn’t stomach food. And again, I slept NONE of these nights. 

I did use clonidine for the RLS and klonopin for anxiety. Without these, I probably would’ve caved.

Day 4 - still hadn’t slept since before day 1. I passed out while trying to reach a box at the top of my closet. My sister freaked out and brought me to the Er. They gave me an antipsychotic for sleep (I’m bipolar so that’s not uncommon) and sent me on my way. I got home, popped one of those suckers and within 30 minutes I was OUT. I slept a full 8 hours.

Day 5 - woke up feeling rested, but my body still felt LETHARGIC. I finally left my room to do some chores and kept having to stop to take breaks. My legs felt heavy, but I decided to go for a walk anyhow. It was super humbling, walking the same route I usually run, and not being able to catch my breath.

Also today the brain fog hit. I was in too much physical pain to notice before, but now I’m having trouble remembering things. I’m speaking slower and I’m much more strained in conversation. This, more than anything, is what scares me… because it seems like a PAWS problem and I have such a hard time handling that.


Day 8 - extreme lethargy. No energy to walk even. Brain fog is immense and caffeine does nothing. Also extreme anxiety. I’m having random panic attacks and am out of klonopin. Cravings were crazy intense this day.

Days 9 - 14 - lethargy persists, as does brain fog. I attempt to run each morning, and my runs are cut short due to exhaustion. I typically run several miles per session, but during this time couldn’t even finish a mile.

Days 14 - 21 - slowly, my stamina begins to return. I run my first full mile. That turns into 2 miles quite quickly. I’m amazed at how much progress I make during this timespan. 

I do, however, struggle with brain fog. It’s intense and debilitating. And doesn’t seem to be letting up anytime soon. 

Day 22 - woke up and ran 2 miles easy. Ate a big healthy breakfast with no GI symptoms. I was in high spirits and even played with my nephew outside for hours. 

I’m no longer avoiding my family or feeling shame. I’m at peace with my decision to quit and don’t feel cravings atm. I feel confident.

I also still have brain fog, but have faith that things will be set right eventually. It could take months before I can concentrate or remember things correctly. I’m okay with that.


That brings me to today.  I can’t wait to see what tomorrow brings. Overall, I fell 1000% better off of kratom than I ever did while on it. Brain fog included. 

I’m so proud of my own progress, along with everyone else’s on this sub. You guys have no idea how much you all mean to me. Whatever stage your at… just keep going. And I will too. I promise.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7447605}"

I´d like to give you another update on my quitting process. I tapered very slowly from about 35gpd and today is the fourth day without any kratom, caffeine or any other drugs. I jumped on monday after two weeks on 0.25gpd; my first 100 hours without kratom or other opioides in years. I was hoping that if I would go slow enough than I wouldn´t have to go through the hellish withdrawals. It didn´t work that way unfortunately. I still fight through waves of heavyness, fatique, restless legs and anxiety but it isn´t as nearly as bad as it was during the first three months of the taper process. I´m able to sleep about seven hours at a time, go to work, don´t get the chills and the sweats anymore and there are more and more moments when I feel happy, optimistic and motivated.  
I still can´t believe how long and hard the withdrawal process was and is in my case but my life on kratom was an absolute nigtmare full of panic attacks, depression, desperation, hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. Sometimes it feels like the withdrawals are never going to end but even if I feel withdrawals like today for the rest of my life it is still better than my life on kratom.   
When you feel like shit because of the withdrawals and you feel like it doesn´t work, remind yourselfe that you felt like shit on kratom, too and that the only way to get your life back is to let your central nervous system heal and reset the damage caused by kratom.   
Stay strong and get your live back!

These withdrawals are extremely weird to me, they haven’t been truly awful. Just a lot of annoyances. Idk if it’s the fact that I’ve been using my medical marijuana that’s helped a lot or what, but I’ve started to feel pretty good most of the time. 

Here are the things that have not been good though, my stomach will get upset randomly. Especially in the mornings. My nose has been runny constantly starting from day 3 on and I’m sneezing all the time. And the first two nights sleep wasn’t actually that bad. But actually falling asleep the last two days has been hard. Thankfully I noticed that once I fell asleep last night, I actually managed to stay asleep for once. 

But outside of those things, stuff really has been feeling a lot better. If you’re going to quit cold turkey and you have access to medical marijuana, use it. I know obviously some people have more severe addictions than others and that weed is not completely safe for everyone. But it’s helped me a lot personally through this whole process and really helped to dull most of the uncomfortable physical symptoms.

Took me weeks to finally register here. 

I need to stop. It's been nearly four years now. I've had enough. My life is a mess. I have no energy to do anything. I'm so slow at everything I do, permanently lethargic and...well I don't need to describe that to you, you know how it is, right? It makes me sad and angry that I am wasting my life and my potential like that. 

Here are a few facts, before I suggest my idea: 

* usually fluctuating between 20-30 gpd (right now even more)
* nearly 4 years 
* keep track of every dose (time of the day and exact grams)
* got down to 6 gpd a few times, even stopped for a few days but...well, I'm here
* managed to withdraw all by my own home alone from Suboxone after nearly a decade  

So, I actually know how it's done. The big difference is, that I hated Suboxone back then, and I still like Kratom. It also shows, that it's a problem of my mind, not so much about the physical withdrawals. I need to get a stronger will, a new determination. Right now, I have no will, I am weaker than ever.

Because I seem to be unable to stop on my own, I came up with a new idea: taper together. 

Would anybody like to taper & withdraw together? There are over 20.000 people here. Surely a few of you would be interested in suffering and succeeding together? 

It would do me so much good, having to be accountable for my consumption. And we would all be going through the same suffering at the same time. I hope to finally be able to stop completely once I am down at a very low daily dose.   
I mean, basically, everyone has to come up with their own schedule and plan because we will have different starting doses, strategies and goals? Or can we all follow the same kind of schedule? Reducing once a week or every four days? Etc. 

Generally, I'm planning for a slow taper which is the best strategy for me. It worked with Suboxone and with Kratom (I just never managed to stop the latter, but taper was successful). Spreading out the times between consumption is vital.   
My plan is basically this:

1. stabilize at a lower dose – right now I am just shoveling it in with no limit
2. following a strict schedule of consuming - e.g. 6 prepared doses of 3g at 6 fixed times a day
3. reduce doses per day as well as grams per dose slowly but steadily - instead of 3g only 2,5g and later instead of 6 times a day, only 5 times a day 
4. stay on a daily dose as long as needed but
5. never go back to a higher dose  

I promise to: 

* be honest – no lies, if I take more, I'll tell you
* I am very serious about my wish to taper and finally stop
* should I give up, I'll let you know and won't ghost you 

OK, so this is my first step: I want to make a commitment, a promise: from Thursday, July 29th to Sunday, August 1st, I will consume no more than 20g a day. 

3g at 8:00, 11:00, 14:00, 17:00, 20:00 and 5g at 23:00.   
I should be fine the first two days, then maybe slightly uncomfortable but nothing too bad. Still a good step for me. On Sunday, I will plan the next step.     
My biggest help will be: my time-locked safe. I can only recommend it. It really works. It's brutal, but necessary. 

As I am new here, I do not know what the best way of documenting would be. Please, can someone more experienced here make a suggestion? One big thread or a regular update – daily, weekly, monthly?   
If nobody is interested, than I will just document my suffering here alone. Maybe this is already enough accountability for me to work. Just thought, someone else might like this idea and join me. I once did such an “online group project” with Internet-strangers for eating more healthily and it was very successful.

Much more personal reason to add that I didn't realize makes me want to be off k forever. A very close family member has had a problem w alcohol her whole life. I would usually get the extracts and head straight over there and take them while trying to convince her to go to treatment. She finally said yes last week and when I picked her up Sunday she said she was done drinking.

If she can quit drinking after a 4 day detox I can stay off k.  I can pray she never drinks again but who knows. 

But I will stay off Kratom.

Edit: another thing that's going to keep me away from the head shop that sells extracts, I pulled out $40 to get two shots and figured I had a couple dollars in loyalty points to cover the other $2 (2 shots-$42). I didn't and ended up having to dig for my car for change. When I first started going there I remember having a good laugh about people who were so addicted they'd ask to spot .50 or $1. 

I became that person. I was .35 short after points and spent 15 min in car to finally find a damn quarter.

Long post but please read.,"So I was supposed to go to a doctors appointment today but oopsies it’s actually tomorrow because I’m dumb. So I was really frustrated that I drove 35 minutes to an appointment I have to go to tomorrow blah blah blah lots of traffic, was crying the entire time because of depression with PAWS (in a few hours I’ll be one month clean CT). Just driving home I felt so alone all of a sudden, severe bad thoughts (not going to describe them to you), migraine, feeling faintish, sobbing my eyes out, feeling like a failure etc. Almost got in ten car accidents (people were driving nuts it was during rush hour), ran out of gas so I had to go off the highway and get gas and the gas station was right next to the smoke shop where I bought my last capsules a month ago, the only time I’d been to that particular smoke shop. Which made me cry even harder. Then I had to just keep driving around the gas station because it was packed, everyone was getting gas, people were rude, just your average day of annoyance where everything goes wrong basically WHILE you’re having really scary depression thoughts. I kept thinking is this how it was 3-4 years ago before I started taking Kratom? Was i always this depressed? And I’m still thinking that. It’s like waking up from a dream right now, like I’ve slept the past 4 years and it’s a SCARY feeling. It’s like… seeing a new color? I can’t explain it. The fog is lifted from my emotions, not having depersonalization or derealization anymore but I’m having severe depression. Everything seems grey. I wanted to go on a run today but I just couldn’t. If I get into an argument with someone it upsets me more than it used to. I was depressed prior to Kratom but not THIS depressed. I’m feeling a little better now, I am just telling myself this is PAWS. About 30 minutes ago I was down cause I was like…. I’m going to have to live with severe dangerous thoughts like this for months? Feeling alone for months??? Then I keep thinking of everyone telling me it gets better and then my brain goes does it??? When???? What am I doing wrong??? Btw I have to suffer this, there’s no way in HELL I’m relapsing HAHAHAHA if I have to deal with this shit again HELL no. Absolutely NOT. The problem is I’m so stubborn and when I say I’m going to quit something I quit. No matter what. No matter how many bullets are thrown my way. No matter how bad the thoughts are. Someone tell me I’ll at least feel a LITTLE better two weeks from now. Please. I can’t live with everyday beating myself up. I know I’m in the worst of PAWS. I regained spirituality which some people aren’t into, and that’s ok this is a no judgement zone but I kept asking God for a sign it’ll get better and I got it. I’m young (just turned 22) so I grew up a Justin Bieber fan (cringe I know) and one of the songs that has helped me not just on my runs but through my sobriety is Never Say Never which was released like a decade ago. And so I open tiktok and the first video I see is a video of jaden smith and Justin Bieber performing that song and the caption is “why is Justin Bieber singing never say never in 2021 lol”. And I took that as my sign. (If you don’t know the song it’s so cheesy but i grew up listening to it and it’s just about overcoming obstacles and keep fighting). So I guess that was my sign. Anyway as I approach hours from one month clean, I am still fighting. Just praying it gets better for the love of god.

You can also get 'broad spectrum' and 'cbd isolate' as well which has zero  thc..or is supposed to contain zero thc. 

Today for example I was sitting around exhausted, feeling like total trash, pretty much unmotivated to even move very much and I took some sublingual full spectrum cbd....and about 5 or 10 minutes later(I have an extremely fast metabolism) I was playing my guitar and enjoying it when earlier I could just stare at it and think 'maybe someday i'll have the energy to pick that thing up again'.

I’m a 2-year 20-30gpd user. After a 3-week taper, I’m now 4 days kratom-free. I know I’m not out of the woods yet, but the worst is over, and I’m starting to feel myself again. I’m a big fan of lists so here’s a collection of things that helped me quit. Hopefully, it helps some of you, but I understand everyone is different… what worked for me may not work for all. 

1) Journal the experience. Keep a written account of your daily activity. Usage, how you feel, what worked / what didn’t. It helps hold yourself accountable.

2) Tell some close friends / family members about both your addiction and your intention to quit. Also an accountability thing.

3) Make a list of reasons you want to quit. I put it at the top of my journal. I checked it often… especially during times when a relapse was creeping.

4) Get a digital scale. In the beginning (before I knew of the dangers), I would just use a big heaping spoonful. Being exact will immensely help with a taper.

5) Find distractions. For me it was video games and walking my dog. Make sure these distractions were not something you enjoyed while using.

6) Exercise. At times during my detox, I was too tired to run, bike or go to the gym. So I would walk… whenever I felt like using, I’d scrape myself off the couch, grab some headphones, and walk. There’s definitely something therapeutic about moving your body forward.

7) One vice at a time. Nicotine and junk food are next on my list of things to quit, but  at least for me, quitting everything at once was too tall of an order. 

8) Supplements. Green tea pills, ginseng, vitamin-c, and maca root for energy during the day. THC/CBD to ward off cravings. I never found anything that truly provided help with sleep… just be prepared for a major sleep deficit. Magnesium helped me with RLS a little. Advil for body aches. 

9) Plan a staycation. I wasn’t able to focus on work during this time. I took a week off  near the end of it. I focused on my diet, exercising everyday, and was able to accommodate the f’d sleep schedule I’d developed.

10) Don’t give up. You might lapse (I did), but shake it off, and get back to the plan tomorrow. Look at the list of reasons you want to quit. Trust me and other members of this group: it’s way better on the other side.

I’ve always dosed between 7-11am, usually two or three doses, so my body is used to going for about 20 hours with no kratom without feeling any WD symptoms. However now I’m literally feeling crappy and it’s only noon, I already did my daily doses and it feels like it’s not even helping at all at this point. I’m debating whether to continue my taper or just toss everything I have left and go CT from here. I mean I was literally feeling better when I woke up this morning (20 hours from my last dose) than I am now, just like 2 hours since my last dose. It seems not even worth it, if I’m gonna feel crappy I may as well just stop taking it altogether. What do y’all think? Would it be worth it to get down to 4gpd before jumping off or am I just prolonging my suffering?


Edit: well the bad news is as I was weighing out my future taper doses, I dumped some in a cup and broke my taper. So today I did about 10g instead of 8. The good news is I subsequently just dumped every last bit of kratom I had and flushed it all down the drain, so that dose I just did will be my last. I’m fucking done.

It wasn't always that way it happened gradually. I was at 30gpd for most of 7 years. When it no longer brought me pleasure and became necessary just to feel normal I figured it was time to quit, this time for good. So I took a week off work while the family was on a mother/child trip, stayed home and did a bunch of outdoor work. It was during the heat of summer so lots of sweating and drinking water. As most other stories indicate, it was a rough week of acutes followed by a few months of paws. I had about every wd symptom that's been mentioned on this board. It was a matter of ""embrace the suck"" and ride it out. Brain fog, RLS, GI issues lasted about a month but gradually got better each day. I used BSO, Magnesium, and Aleve for some relief. When I couldn't sleep (which was most of the first week) I binged several Netflix series. I later discovered CBD oil which seemed to help, wish I had known that earlier. So that's it folks! I always say if I can do it so can anybody. I'm not exactly known for my willpower over things I find pleasant (which is why I had to go CT instead of taper). I recently also gave up alcohol, which was a walk in the park compared to kratom. This board /quittiungkratom and the /stopdrinking board were probably the best thing I did that helped.

I have had severe kidney and back pain for about 9 years stemming from an autoimmune disease and being hit from behind while sitting at a red light by an intoxicated driver. I was in pain management for 6 years on 5mg of oxycodone as needed along with a non-narcotic muscle relaxer- I did well with the 5mg dose but at times of intense pain went as high as 15mg to treat breakthrough pain. I would go as far as to say it gave me my life back. I could work again- date again- I never had a problem with the opioid. Fast forward to now and we moved out of the state where my pain management doctors were and to a state that is a FUCKING NIGHTMARE to get the medication I need. I rationed my last prescription for 3 months after our move and ran out in March. The debilitating pain came back and I’m a stay at home mom to a 9 month old  (I don’t know why I feel I need to say this but I completely stopped pain medicatio upon discovering I was pregnant very early in my pregnancy-my baby girl is my life and a complete miracle as I wasn’t supposed to be able to have kids. It was a very scary and traumatic pregnancy for both me and my partner bc I was so high risk and sick/in excruciating pain the entire time- I am also NOT breastfeeding just so no one thinks I would put my child at any risk.) my point is being a stay at home mom along with the back and kidney pain issues I was told about Kratom. I thought it sounded like a great solution to the lack of pain management I was having where we moved. Here we are in July (using it since March) and now I’m really worried about what I have gotten myself into. I ran out of kratom a few weeks ago and didn’t think anything of it…thought I’d be fine for a few days until my next order came…BECAUSE THERE ARE NO WITHDRAWL SYMPTOMS RIGHT AND IT’S SOOOOO SAFE RIGHT?! Holy shit ya’ll I have never had that bad of withdrawal symptoms even from prescription opioids. 
My significant other is in law-enforcement and he immediately suspected that my extreme anxiety, depression, pain and inability to cope with life was due to the fact that I had run out of kratom. I went through 2 days of hell and started to feel a little better- then my order got here. I continued taking it because my pain was so bad but now kicking myself because I made it through 2 1/2 days of misery and I probably should’ve just stopped then 😭. I am concerned having no pain relief from anything OTC, and I am also unable to use any form of NSAID due to my kidneys without Kratom I’m not even sure I will be able to function through my pain. I’m starting to taper down today. I  don’t even know what a large dose is I was told about this by a friend who literally takes 17 g at a time- I use 2 tsp about every 6 hours and I’m freaking out because now that I’m researching I think that is a lot and I didn’t realize this would cause such severe withdrawals. I’ve never abused pain medications or used an illegal non- prescribed drug in my life (ZERO judgment to those who have I just feel that is relevant to state here due to others stories I have read I want to give an accurate account of my experience). I never had withdrawals remotely as uncomfortable from my prescribed pain meds even when I stopped taking them because I was having a good stretch of tolerable pain. This shit is bad and I’m worried for my mental health. I’m also so embarrassed…I have a baby and my husband is a cop…we live in a small town I cannot seek “help” for this without heavy judgement and people finding out. I am terrified right now. I am going to start tapering down by 1/2 tsp per dose today then another 1/2 next week so on and so forth. Is there ANYTHING that can help with the side effects of withdrawing especially the severe anxiety? The physical pain sucks bad but I don’t want to be a slave to this stuff. I have so much anger and resentment towards the fact that I would never be in this worse situation if those of us who actually need opioid treatment due to autoimmune conditions causing severe pain were treated on an individual basis without judgment or restrictions regardless of the state we live in. Why did I not go through this with the prescription opioid but I am going through this with Kratom?! I feel pretty hopeless and scared right now. Any advice is appreciated. I am also sorry if I come off as a bitch. I don’t think because I have autoimmune conditions and physical pain that it makes me any better than anyone else who’s using Kratom for whatever issue they’re using it for. I’m just scared and a mess right now. Please be kind.",4,{'immun': 3},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45577055}"

I took over and ran one of my families small businesses for about 6-7 months. At 19, I’d work 75 hours a week being a boss at a gas station and stressed out 24/7. One month in, just when I couldn’t take it anymore, I drank my first viva zen and life changed completely. It helped me through 18 hour shifts some days and I thought I was happy with life. I was lonely and left my hometown where I went to college, had many friends, but was heartbroken over an ex girlfriend of mine, my first love. money was my only motivation and goal at that point, I wanted to impress her so I moved away and started working. I started at 3 gpd, and worked all the way up to 20 in a few months. I slowly became miserable. I watched my life flash before my eyes with no feelings, I felt like I died. It was like a weird acid trip with no visuals, 24/7. Kratom was my new reality, new sober. It stopped working for me, and I started moving up to opioids, all the way to fentanyl. I overdosed and died for 20 mins on my birthday. That was the last day I touched kratom and any opioids. I went through the worst pain of my life for one week, my bones felt like they were slowly breaking. After that, I struggled to come to terms with reality and felt constant anxiety, even now I feel it. I had a great summer with my friends, and have slowly been forgetting about those days, although they still haunt me. I struggle to get out of my house everyday and constantly stress about my life now. I wish I never started. I hope I can find my motivation again, I hope I can see the light again.

I am a quiet reader of this sub and decided now it's time for me to write something.
First of all, excuse my English - I'm from Germany ;)

I used kratom since March 2019. At first I took one dose á 2 gpd. I liked the way it took my social anxiety ( I'm in the diagnosis process of autism + adhd, maybe there's a correlation). I have to say that I am a sober alcoholic. I drank between 21 an 27 years every day, wine, but at the end up to 1,5 liters every afternoon. 

Okay, I am 32 now (female) and took kratom for like 2 years. I think I was at 10-15 gpd. In the end it wasn't giving me the same feeling like in the beginning - sometimes maybe but I don't know if it was the kratom or my cycle or something else like nice weather. So I decided to quit. I took my last dose on a Tuesday at 2pm. The next three to four days were awful! Cold all the time, turkeyskin and lots of sweat. My mind was also baaaad as fuck! I know these depressing states of mind, but this was on another level. 

My executive disfunction was on the max and I thought will this be better? 

On Sunday evening it became. I was outside, calling friends ( the week I couldn't talk to anyone - besides my friend who was at my place till Sunday. Thank God I know you!). 

On Monday it was better again and Tuesday again... Till now! Everyday is getting better! And on day 10 I thought already ""okay, I'm here again in my full power. Loving life and seeing the Beauty in everything "" 

It's still getting better, last night I slept 9 hours! Wow, my energy is great.
I'm still struggling a little bit with executive dysfunction, but I don't think it is because of quitting. 

For completeness, I used xanax (0,5) and vitamin c the first few days and take ashwaganda and maca until now (my cycle is off). 
Also I'm reading again! I loved to read as a child and young adult and lost it in my ""career"". Feels amazing :) 

My mind is powerful like it hasn't been in the last two years. I'm a software developer, so that is a very important step for my self acceptance.

The first time I started- I had a herniated disc and had crippling pain, kratom kept me functional. When it started to heal, I tapered down about .5g/day without any real problem.

This year I reaggravaged the disc again and was in pain again, so I started up on the kratom again taking 5g doses when I got up when the pain was worse and whenever the pain got bad.

Eventually it resolved after doing PT exercises, cut back on the kratom- but holy shit this is so much worse. Complete lack of energy, sweats, fatigue, severe depression, very dark thoughts... Shows that kindling is real because this is terrible. I didn't realize it was withdrawal at first until one time I was feeling the symptoms, tried some kratom, and it went away.

I'm now down to 3.5g/day tapering with .5 g capsules, came here and read the guide to tapering on the sidebar,

I saw that it recommends spreading doses throughout the day and keeping the decline in kratom use as much of a straight line as possible. I had a couple questions on this recommendation:

-Would it make sense to start the day with a larger dose in the morning since that is when my body is most used to kratom, for instance if I want to go down to 3g/day, maybe start with a dose of 1.5 g on waking and then do 3 .5 g doses throughout the day?

-If I have a day where I don't have a lot of obligations and can get away with taking less kratom than what I am scheduled to , will that speed the withdrawal process? For example Saturday and Sunday I toughed it out without taking any kratom, though it sucked. Or is it more important to keep a consistent steady decline every day until I can jump to 0?

I never wanted to increase my dose for a ""high"" as K never did that for me, only pain relief and relief from the giant PITA of getting regular RX's of pain meds. I have an entrapped nerve in my groin. 

When buying from different vendors or getting new batches from same vendors, I noticed that small variances in the quality or makeup would send me into withdrawal. Then I would increase the dose to try and feel better. At my highest, which was 2 months ago, I was at about 35-40GPD of a mix from an online source and a very expensive local shop. 

2 months ago I bit the bullet and tried CT, using a ton of supplements. I couldn't take the RLS and insomnia past the 2nd day. I eventually settled at about 12-14GPD now of the expensive shop K, which is I chose because they test it for quality and I wanted to not have any surprises. The journey here has been rough due to the anxiety and depression, especially since I am a total introvert and lonely to begin with. The insomnia is brutal still, I was sometimes not sleeping at all, mostly 2-4 hours a night. I finally was prescribed Seroquel for sleep, and it has helped me get close to 5 hours a night. 

I want to QUIT. I exercise a ton every day, and I have been talking to a substance abuse counselor for the 2 months, learning breathing exercises and what not. My mind seems to be the worst enemy because I worry so much, and ruminate on my situation a lot. I have a job, but the wage is crap and I'll probably quit for the jump off K. I have a month of savings to get clean with.

I have figured out I have 3 options. 

1. Detox in my apartment alone and somehow try to keep my mind together.... but I have all my distractions and personal comforts, as well as numerous options for exercise. 
2. Drive south for 8 hours and stay with my wealthy sister who knows the situation, and there are places to exercise all around there, but she works all day and I wont have much of my stuff there for comfort.
3. Detox at a non-profit residential facility with 2 or 3 people to a room, fully structured, but no contact with family and not many options for exercise. I'm sure they would want to medicate me for sleep, etc. I would be in there with convicts and hard core addicts.

How bad can I expect to suffer at 12-14GPD (day)? I take a 50/50 mix of red and gold bali, and am still in PAWS from my big reduction 2 months ago. Am I prolonging my suffering by still taking my reduced dose? I am afraid of being alone during the worst withdrawal and I know my brain is going to make it worse. I feel like such a wimp because I see people here dropping off at 60GPD and higher, I just have no support around me besides calls to mom (different state) and my once a week visit with a counselor.

(I'm sorry. I'm an introvert, even on a keyboard.)

I'm Day 11 CT after a 3-year daily habit.  I was introduced to K by a colleague who told me that I should try this 'natural energy' because I always 'look so tired' (eyeroll).  I had no idea it could be addictive, and I knew nothing about 'opioid receptors,' withdrawals, or anything.  I only used K in the morning and early afternoon (the powder mixed with water - it was SO FCKIN FOUL but I choked it down).  

After not feeling well for a few weeks, I googled 'K side effects' and that's when I decided to quit completely.  (I know, I should have done this research before ever trying it but I'm not a 'read the directions' kind of person).  So it's been rough on and off - lots of crying, panicking, being awake from midnight - 6:00 a.m. most nights with RLS and anxiety.  I'm glad to be off K though and I'm just looking forward to when these overwhelming feelings  are a little less frequent.

I'm also a 5-years sober recovering alcoholic so this isn't my first addiction rodeo.  I do hope it's the last.

I need to step away from kratom permanently. This is a very unhealthy dependency. I'm terrified of quitting for many reasons, mainly experiencing full-fledged DTs.

Can anyone help? What can I do to ease the discomfort of withdrawal symptoms? How long will they last? Is it worth tapering down and quitting slowly or should I quit all at once. I'm genuinely desperate for help.

With Vyvanse, I can go almost an entire day on a single dose before WD kicks in and when it does, it is far less intense. It can be mitigated by a small dose before bedtime.

I never ended up quitting it so just added kratom to my mess of drugs. I’ve had periods where I’ve been off with no problems but last year I got pregnant with my first daughter and had to immediately stop the lyrica so I stated kratom again for nerve pain and to help with energy. I had planned to stop once I gave birth and could get back on my normal scripts (lyrica, adderal, klonopin) but never got off and again, was just added to the things I take. While pregnant I was taking around 30gpd and since then it’s just continued to increase; I’m not even sure how many gpd ive been taking, anywhere from 20-60gpd. 
Anyways I want to quit again, I just passed my licensing exam for real estate and life’s about to get super busy; ive been lucky enough to be a stay at home mom (single) since my daughter was born, she’ll be a year old next month. I just can’t be planning my day around kratom anymore and I’m just sick of what it does to me, I don’t even feel anything from it now, it’s just to stop WD. It makes me sweat buckets from my face and I live in SC so it’s always hot and it also has thinned and broken my hair. I just went 24 hours but the RLS and fatigue was killing me this morning so I dosed about 10g. I thought I could CT but I think I need to taper first. I’m here to hold myself accountable.

I have another thread highlighting how I am doing this with step by step updates but what I am about to say today, deserves its own thread. I believe that for some, it will make the difference between winning this fight, or losing it. This may be a little long but you will want to read it. 

Very quickly, I have known adversity well for the past 5 years. I was born and raised into an upper middle class family and had every opportunity to succeed. Yet, 5 years ago, I found myself staring at the ceiling of a dingy motel room,in a cold sweat, wondering how I was going to pay the next days rent. My friendships and relationships were gone. My truck had just been repo’d and I was $50k in revolving debt. Everything around me was falling apart. 

One day, I had a shift in mindset. From that day on and over the next 5 years, I rebuilt my life into something I never thought was possible. Today, I sit here in my fully paid off dream home. My amazing wife and son have started their day. I am about to head into a job I love and am rewarded by. This is all the result of extreme sacrifice, extreme will power and a very specific mindset. A mindset that has evolved and been forged through the battles it took to get to this point. The lessons I have learned from it have pushed me to want more and see how much further I can go. One of the things this led me to was ultra distance trail running and trust me, I hate running. But it’s the one thing that allows me to use the things I’ve learned to push through the pain and the desire to give up. It sharpens and hones the strengths I have built over this journey. 

Yet as I type this, I know I am about to face one the most difficult battles I’ve fought and so are most of you reading this. What I am about to say is one of the most important things you will read before or during your fight against this dark, soul sucking, life ending enemy. If you are getting ready to join the battle, you must get your mindset right. 

In every negative situation, there are positives you can take away from it. Today, I am going to share some of the most important things I’ve learned that I believe are absolutely necessary to getting through any type of adversity including this:

1: Surround yourself with the right people and remove the people who are not helping you move forward. This group is full of people who have won the battle you are about to face. Listen to them and learn from them. 

2: Motivation to quit is and will be temporary. Do not rely on this alone. In order to succeed at anything, you need discipline. When the motivation runs out, it is what’s going to carry you. The best way to start, is to plan every single day down to the hour. Wake up, make your bed, go for a run, and the list goes on. Do that long enough and it becomes automatic. 

3: Take responsibility. You must accept that the only reason or person responsible for where you are is yourself. Regardless of circumstance. If you find yourself blaming someone or something else, you will fail. You can’t change other people and you can’t change what life throws at you. But you can change yourself and how you react to what life throws at you. 

4: Do not be a victim, because no one is coming to save you. If you see yourself as one, change your perspective. View your life as a movie where you are the hero of your story and the things you need to change are the enemy. 

5: DO NOT STOP. This is one of the most important. No one who has seen success in anything has walked a straight line to get there. You will want to give up, you will fail some days and you will doubt yourself. The only thing that separates those who have success from those who see failure in anything is that the successful do not stop, ever. No matter how far back or how far down life knocks you, get up and keep moving forward. This is the kryptonite against life. It’s the one thing that life hates most and if you do it long enough, eventually, life is going to get out of the way. 

6: The force of average. This is a strong one. Our brains are physically wired to keep us safe. To keep us comfortable, alive and free from pain. It controls you through fear. Much like addiction, these are physical neural pathways our brains have developed and breaking them is very difficult. One of the only ways to break them, is repetitious behavior. To create new neural pathways that detour the old ones. The moment you step outside of your comfort zone, the moment you decide to quit, the first thing you’re going to notice is this force of average trying to pull you back in. At first, it’s going to be difficult and it’s good at what it does. It’s going to try to convince you that it’s ok to just take one dose to feel better, just for today. It is your brain trying to keep you safe and free from pain. If you want to succeed, you must accept this and commit to never, not once, giving into it. The further you go, the easier it will be to ignore it. 

7: Pain is temporary. When you are pushing through the hardest days, you must remember that this pain, no matter how great it is, is temporary. Eventually, it will subside. And in its place is going to be something much, much better. Imagine this battle like this: You are standing in front of a huge, dark storm where all of the good things in your life are on the other side of this storm. To get to them, you need to face the storm and commit to pushing through it. The further you get through it, the more difficult it is going to become. The rain, wind and lighting will be all around you but every single step you take forward, is closer to the other side. Then, one day, you’re going to look up and your going to see the sun shining through the clouds and everything good in your life is going to be there, waiting for you to take those last few steps. 

8: Do not let this time in your life define you. It is not who you are if you say it’s not. Not just with words but with real life action. If we allow outside things to define us, we become them and therefor controlled by them. You must turn that type of thinking around. You are here to define them, not the other way around. 

Lastly: Make no mistake about it, when you come out the other side of this, you are not going to be the same person as you were before you started. You’re going to be better. Much better. Right now, you probably wish you never went down this path to begin with. When you get to the end however, you will realize it has given you something that very few people alive today have been given. The opportunity to truly know who you are deep down and that your limits, are only what you make them. While most people go about their average, routine days, you’re going to be fighting for your life. In that process, you’re going to learn that you have strengths you never knew existed. Your going to understand the importance of persistence, will power and discipline. That fear isn’t real. It’s just a manifestation of your mind trying to keep you safe and that you can control it. These are things you can only learn about yourself through extreme adversity. When you come out the other side, you are not just a recovering addict, you are a warrior. Do not take this lightly. It’s not a joke. With this experience comes great power. Everything that life used to throw at you, all the things that you thought were difficult, are going to be minimal in hindsight. The best part is, you can now apply the knowledge you’ve gained about yourself, the confidence in yourself, to every other aspect of your life. Your work, relationships, and dreams, can be whatever you want them to be because you know you have what it takes to get there. 

In conclusion, I highly recommend surrounding yourself in learning the stories of individuals who have also gone through hell and back. Follow their stories and listen to what they have to say. You will start to see an emerging pattern of the virtues it takes to keep going. Every single day, on my ride to and from work, during my workouts and my lunch breaks, I’m listening to the likes of Goggins, Jocko, and Jordan Peterson. Go on YouTube and look up motivational videos by them and other like them. These people have been places mentally and physically that most don’t even know exist. If you surround yourself with their words every day, you will start to hear them in moments of trial and weakness. It will help you. In either case, I will be fighting this fight alongside of you all for the coming weeks and months. I sincerely hope this will help some of you the same way I already know it is going to help me. Keep fighting.",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49107546}"

I was able to quit kratom CT in April of last year. Stayed off the stuff until October of the same year. The physical withdrawal was not so bad but it was mental hell for me. Had 0 motivation for months. In fact, the reason I picked it back up again is because I was making a big move from FL to OH and driving my cat there. Needed motivation (or at least this is what I told myself) to do all the things necessary to make that happen, including staying with family I had not seen in a long time who I wanted to be in a good, upbeat, motivated mood around.

So here I am a little less than a year later and I am desperate to quit again, but it's even harder this time around. I did quit for 10 days back in May to do Ibogaine. It wasn't too terribly bad actually, and I had to travel to Mexico, meet my spouse's family I had never met before (who is latin and does not understand this stuff at all), participate in activities at the Ibogaine facility and socialize with the people there, all while in withdrawal. And I got through it. The experience left me with 0 desire to ever drink again (my main addiction and the reason I picked up kratom to begin with), but I poured myself a cup of the green stuff as soon as I got back home, anxiety being on high (which it had been almost every day I was in Mexico).

My hair is at a turning point where I am no going to be able to hide the loss any longer if I keep it up.

So this time I am prepared. I have an arsenal of supplements and vitamins to soften the blow, hopefully, which I did not have the first time I quit. I have the following:

Loperamide

Lion's mane

Rhodiola Rosea

Black seed oil

Fish oil

L-Theanine

DLPA

Ashwagandha

Agmatine

CBD oil

5HTP

Valerian root

Turmeric & Ginger with Bioperine

every vitamin you can think of, including a good Magnesium

Phenibut

Poppy seed tea (I understand this is crazy controversial, and I get why)

&#x200B;

I am able to use Phenibut on occasion without the slightest desire to use it again, and I know it is highly addictive. So I figured in the thick of it, a few sips of poppy seed tea might help with sleep. But I would be extraordinarily cautious here.

I would also like everyone's thoughts on the best combination of supplements to take for this. I most definitely don't want to take all that together in case of bad interactions.

Maybe I should just have some fun for a few more days and try to use it all up, so I can use the last bit of what’s left to finish tapering down.” So I broke my taper and ended up doing another 5 grams. 

Instant fucking regret, after the initial high wore off I felt nauseous (I guess cuz my body was used to the 10gpd) and really dumb for ruining my taper. So I set a hard quit date for myself two weeks from now, got a bunch of baggies and a vitamin organizer, and separated out 12 days of gradually decreasing dosages. Then I ran the large bag under the sink to sludge it up, and threw it messily into the outdoor garbage bin.

Still feel pretty dumb for thinking I could successfully taper down to nothing while also holding onto a giant bag of the stuff, but you live and learn. So anyway, here it goes.",23,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9113142}"

So I started daily k around 6-7 years ago. I had tried it a couple times before that but it was just in small doses in passing from a friend. When I bought it myself the first time it was after another friend introduced me to it formally haha. I loved it that night and it was amazing. I realized at the end of the night that I hadn't drank/ingested anywhere near as much as I normally did. From there I was under the impression that it wasn't addictive and essentially perfect. I did a little research and I told myself that everything I found saying that it wasn't addictive was just BS from anti druggers. (At that time, there was a good amount saying it was perfectly safe as well) I ignored it all and started taking it every day. A couple months in, I realized that I didn't really care as much about smoking weed anymore and I had almost completely stopped drinking. (These had been my daily vices since my freshman/sophomore year of highschool). I decided to ramp it up and stop smoking and drinking to be ""healthy"". (Another convenient thought for me at that time haha)  I loved it and I started buying bulk by the kilo. A couple years later, I tried stopping the first time to show myself that I wasn't addicted. Well I was wrong haha.  I relapsed almost immediately and since then have tried a couple other times but always gave up saying that I needed it to work. Well, I planned a vacation for myself back around Christmas and started my taper. I was around 100 gpd. (Or I was going through 2 kilos around every 2-3 weeks but didn't measure at all)  I have gotten myself down to around 10-15 a day now. Well that vacation I planned starts Wednesday so I have two and a half weeks off.  I have made progress so far but a lot of that is thanks to this group so thank you all, like really fucking sincerely. Fuck I'm scared, I haven't been sober (from alcohol, weed or k) for the past 12ish years.  I will always love drugs (I am definitely who I am today partially because of them) but I think I fucked up by starting earlyish and never taking a day off haha.  This post is partially to find myself accountable but I hope if there is anyone else out there it can help. Just through my taper I have noticed an incredible increase in my quality of sleep, my sex drive, my stomach hasn't been as fucked up constantly, and I don't have to dose in the night and dose when I wake up to stop shaking.  Fuck..  That is nice. Anyway, I truly I am thankful to all of you and I will try to make updates.

I was a 24 GPD user for about 6 months of Kratom leading up to something if a catastrophe in my life. When me (21M) and my ex (20F) broke up she overdosed and I was able to save her, rushing her to the hospital for a stomach pump. I stayed with her the whole night, I had to work the next day despite being totally exhausted emotionally and physically. I worked the whole shift, got through it alright, and my boss and manager who had been great sources of support in the past treated me coldly and fired me on the spot. 2 weeks later I learned my ex had been cheating on me for months. I fell sort literally, 50 GPD, smoking a pack a day, adderrall. After some time passed it occurred to me that I need to quit Kratom, I simply had no libido or testosterone, and I no longer felt like a man. I began a slow taper, now down to 16 GPD, after a short relapse. I’m now in a relationship with my high school crush, enormously loving and supportive but because of Kratom and my cheating ex, I have mild ED, and serious performance anxiety. I want to be the man I once was for her, but as I’m tapering I’ve resorted to using viagra and gabapentin so that I still have a sex life and can resist cravings easier. I feel like a pill head, and trauma keeps coming back which makes we want to relapse. Idk, I’m struggling and I need a little help and wisdom in getting through this taper. I’ve become more disciplined, bagging each day by scale, and giving my stash to a friend to hide. I want to tear the band aid off so to speak, so I aim to reach 9 GPD from 16 within 10 days. Is this overly ambitious? Should I just cold turkey? I want to be totally sober before university this fall, and I’m worried because improving my mental health has never been so difficult.

I've been lurking for a while trying to tap the wisdom of this sub. I'm reaching out because I can't find any information about my particular symptoms.
Here is my situation- I began a taper about a month ago. I went from 32g a day to 16 in my first taper. I had some WD but nothing too serious. I next dropped 16 to 12. Again, not too bad. My last drop, about 2 weeks ago, was from 12g to 8g. While I expected some WD symptoms, I continue to feel sick. The main symptoms are fatigue, nausea, chills and sweats. I can get around, but I feel wiped out. The main thing is that there seems to be no improvement day to day. It's thrown off my taper schedule. I should have been keeping a journal, but I remember starting to feel better after my last cut before the chilly nausea sweats kicked in about a week ago.
Has anybody been stuck like this in a taper?
Do you think that perhaps I have a stomach bug or something else not related to kratom?
It seems weird to be stuck at the same point of w/d 2 weeks after my last cut.

Today is day 2 no kratom and I took like 1mg this morning about 29 hours after my first dose, maybe less. My goal is to take like half a mg tomorrow as late in the day as I can manage and be done, 3 day taper, but I will go 5 days max if I’m too sick still after that. I know this sub is quick to say subs are a bad option and not necessary for K but kratom has way too short of a half life to taper with imo, it’s just excruciating and a few days on a very tiny sub dose can significantly break the fall without causing a worse habit to develop as long as you keep it to that.

2021-07-26 19:38:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/osb2xq/day_16_personal_inventory/,Day 16- personal inventory,"Hey guys,

I hope you're hanging in there and I hope the days are getting easier. I'm at day 16, and while I still have much healing left to do, I'm very much feeling like myself again. I wanted to post what worked for me  both to help anyone struggling and as a self-inventory of my own progress.

Here's what's worked for me:

1. As has been stated time and time again on this sub, exercise is your greatest ally. There will be days when you tell yourself that you just can't do it. To be clear, you must do it. If you are having motivational issues, force yourself to get your heart rate up via exercise bike, jogging in place or jumping jacks, then drop and do a set of pushups to exhaustion. I guarantee that the vast majority of the time, this will kick in your endorphins, and you will feel up to the challenge. (Note: you don't need any fancy equipment. You can get a good workout with your bodyweight.)
2. This is intimately related to point number 1: take a couple of pics of yourself today. Make sure you get a pic of your face and hairline as well as a pic of physique. Prior to making the jump, I had started working out to help with my GI issues. However because of kratom, my workouts were half-assed, and I was eating garbage for dinner half the time. Right now, I'm hitting it hard and doing it right along with proper diet. I got out of the shower today and looked in the mirror. I barely recognized the person staring back at me. I've dropped almost 5 pounds of belly fat and am beginning to get my definition back thanks to proper workouts, proper diet, and the return of my testosterone. Nothing will keep you going like tangible results, and this step is the easiest way to grasp the tangible positive results of your self-discipline.
3. Find a soundtrack for your life. As many members of this sub have noted, music is felt once again after the kratom fog begins to lift. This is, in and of itself, a reason to quit. However, I've also found that you can regulate moods with music during the recovery process. As I've discussed with my good friend  u/TurkeyOfMyDreams, if I need energy, I'll throw on something uptempo like punk rock or the Rocky soundtrack. If I need to get through a wave of anxiety, I'll throw on something ambient. If I want to feel pleasant and upbeat, I'll throw on some bluegrass. Find the sounds that resonate for you and use them to your advantage.
4. Reward but don't spoil yourself. First of all, this one is not necessarily applicable if you're in the midst of the first 3 to 4 days. Do what you need to do to beat the acutes. Once you're over the worst of the acute withdrawal symptoms, you need to set yourself up to incrementally reward yourself. In my own personal battle, food looms large. I eat well balanced meals all throughout the working week to nourish and repair my body. However on Friday and Saturday, I'm allowed something tasty and not so healthy. Set boundaries for yourself so that you can simultaneously grow but enjoy the good stuff in life.
5. Once you are over the acutes, force yourself to spend time with other human beings, Covid permitting of course. You will probably not want to do this. Make yourself do it. I really didn't want to meet up with a friend on Saturday night, but it ultimately helped me turn a corner. If you want to feel human again, rejoin the human race.
6. Several times a day, look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself how awesome you are. You might be saying, ""Oh, but I suck. Look at the spot I'm in."" I am here to tell you that you are awesome. One only needs to go to a certain other subreddit to see that most people choose to live in a comfortable but detrimental state of denial. That is not you. You are here, and by virtue of being here, you have demonstrated both the wisdom and the strength to recognize a problem and do something about it. You are strong. You are remarkable. You deserve the best in life because you are a good and empathetic person who moves forward. Tell yourself this in the mirror several times a day.
7. Do something kind for another person everyday. Service to others provides perspective and offers a sense of purpose. Additionally, empathy is as much a learned skill as it is a purely innate characteristic. It's important to grow as a person during this process, and empathy toward others helps teach us to exercise empathy for ourselves.
8. Do something kind for yourself everyday. Buy something you've been wanting but haven't because of the cost of kratom, take a relaxing bath etc.. You deserve relief and compassion. Don't deny self-care due to some misplaced sense of self loathing.
9. Your libido has returned. Use it, be it with a partner or by yourself.
10. Find what supplements work for you. Personally, I have gotten good results for neurocognitive recovery via a twice daily regimen of fish oil and turmeric/curcumin with a bit of CBD tincture around bedtime for sleep.
11. Deep clean your home. Not only is it distracting and physically challenging, but it also gives you a great lift when you are done. Your mood will change dramatically if you are surrounded by a healthy and clean environment.
12. Create a mechanism of accountability. I've told several friends about my issue, and it's helped immensely. Additionally, the daily check in here is an act of personal accountability.
13. Most importantly, do the hard work of addressing the underlying psychological issues surrounding your addiction. I suppressed a lot of heartache and trauma with kratom. The key to staving off relapse is to get to the root of the problem. If you don't have access to a mental health provider at this time, put your trust in someone you know who is both wise and of high character. You will not regret finally verbalizing that which vexes you.

&#x200B;

I hope this is helpful to someone out there. I'm beginning to feel like myself and to like myself again. I wish you the same kind of success.

I’ve been planning for a long time that I need to quit kratom. It’s been an imposition on my life, I feel like I’ve been held captive by it. And just can’t afford to be on it any longer. So I scheduled a week and a half off from work to make sure I work this out. But I’m horrified of it, I took my last dose roughly 7 hours ago and my mind has been racing about negative outcomes. I keep thinking about weird medical things that could happen like somehow dying from withdrawals. Or I keep thinking that maybe I should have tapered, even though I’m aware I don’t have the self control for that. I keep wondering when the worst of it will kick in. So it feels like I know I’m about to get shot, and just waiting for it to happen. 

But then I’ll break free of that negative cloud and I’ve been trying to think positively. I have medical marijuana I’ve been prescribed and so I’m really hoping that using this will help soften the blow. And I’ve been drinking a lot of water, taking multivitamins and generally just hoping that maybe it won’t be as severe as others. It’s a multi year addiction, probably at least 3 at this point. But I’m 23 so I’m still fairly young and I’m hoping my body can fight it. I also never got as up there in dosage per day as some people. So anyways, I guess the point is that I’m very scared and I hope this will go well for me. I just need to get rid of it. I can’t afford to pay for it anymore, my girlfriend hates it, and it’s made me lose a lot of desire or interest in my hobbies and even just daily life.

I quit kratom over 6 months ago and feel great because of it. There’s no way in hell I’d ever consider using it again. I did relapse for almost a full month on oxy during June-July but it was for legit pain reasons. I never plan on touching opioids again though because I was quickly reminded about how terrible the lifestyle and withdrawals are. I’m day 4 since that last oxy dose, and am feeling withdrawal, although on a much lower level than when I dumped kratom/opioids in January. Now to address the title…I have been a daily weed smoker/edible user for 10 years (since I was 16) and just within the last 9 months or so I’ve been a daily drinker 2-3 beers during weekdays, 6-10 beers on weekends, mostly because my new roommate is an alcoholic and I can’t turn down a beer being offered. I’ve been using kava fairly frequently also since quitting kratom. Well I’m here to say, I’m dropping all those habits. Weed I want gone for good or at least very minimal use (not buying or keeping any at home), alcohol or kava I want to be reserved for weekends only and not insane amounts. Kratom and other opioids are obviously gone for good and I can easily grapple with that one, it’s the quitting weed and alcohol that gives me some anxiety thinking about it right now. I just tossed all my weed and kava in the trash and I’m ready to battle the urge to drink when my roommate gets home from work with a 12 pack in hand. I need to get this habitual “I need SOMETHING” out of my head asap and return to my old pleasures (exercise, video games, socializing, and more).

It isn't the physical symptoms, but the mental cravings and anger/anxiety. So I was wondering!

&#x200B;

If I go 36  hours into withdrawal to the point where it gets mentally unbearable, can I do a extremely low dose of Suboxone as needed VERY SPARINGLY? I'm talking 0.05mg-0.20mg under the tounge. Which is 1/10th-1/20th of a single milligram. This would ensure I wouldn't get addicted , it would just take the edge off while the Kratom alkaloids are rapidly leaving my system. Does this make any sense, or am I just postponing the withdrawal slightly?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After 4-5 days Kratom withdrawal dies down for me and gets easier (I quit before) So the 1.5 day mark is where I do the extreme low dose sub. After 4 days maximum, flush the suboxone.

&#x200B;

Then go 10 days off of Kratom/suboxone and get started on NALTREXONE for opiate craving relapse prevention.

This had always been marketed to me as a safe substance. I was only drinking it at night to fall asleep. Last Monday I ended up feeling crappy from my dose and decided to take the week off.  It was absolutely fucking miserable, and I felt like I was having a panic attack all week.  On Friday, I decided to use some kratom to sleep, and only after I started drinking did I realize ""wait, was my anxiety all week from Kratom withdrawal?""  And now I'm so mad at myself because now I'm trying to taper down but I feel like if I had just rode it out Friday night I would be half way home now.  And to see the guide in here that it can take so long to feel normal again makes me panic.  I work in a rehab setting, I feel like I'm dying of anxiety and I don't know whether I should just try CT again and suck it up for a few days feeling like absolute garbage or continue to use a little bit throughout the day and taper down.

2021-07-26 15:09:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/os5pa4/adding_to_anecdotal_detox_experiences/,Adding to anecdotal detox experiences,"I had been using Kratom from 2015 to 2021.  Quit about 14 days ago, cold turkey, and now  feel almost my normal self.  Still some heightened pain sensation (where logically it's a one or two in my back and hips, but it's registering in my brain like a 5 or 6).   Pain is the reason I started, but kratom is the reason i stopped my prescribed opioid medications.  I also went through oxycontin withdrawals in 2005 (short two-week date with 40 mg oxies,  no medicinal reason--purely drug abuse -- so a high dose short term bender, but one that produced just about all of the classic opioid  withdrawal symptoms and most definitely led to a full two-week recovery commitment from acute symptoms).  So I have the comparison in my head. 

The timeline to kratom chemical dependency is typical.  First-year, careful to use only twice a week.  By end of year 2, daily use, (6 grams)  by end of year 3 heavier daily use (10g), after that who know.s...fill the shot glass 3x per day..more if withdrawals kicked in.  By year three there was no effect, (but the pain stayed reduced).   Quit ahead of a medical diagnostic procedure earlier this month.   Never used extracts. 

Kratom cratered my hormones.  nearly zero on the old testosterone scale.  Guys, do your bloodwork to make sure your hormones aren't affected by chronic kratom use.  Mine were. 

Day 2 - Approximately 15 hours after last kratom dose, felt restless legs and restless hands.  Like electricity shooting into both.  Heightened backpain.   Hard to get much sleeps but I did manage to get some. One other side effect  - any amount of liquid in my bladder caused me oversensitivity and increased electric hands and feet sensation.  Had to urinate at least every half hour, especially overnight, not because my bladder was full, but because it was so uncomfortable. 

Day 3 - electric hands and feet reached their peak, insomnia, heightened nonspecific pain sensation in back, hips peaked

Day 5 - most symptoms abated, felt mental clarity for first time in years, but any receptor-oriented substance caused withdrawals to come back, especially alcohol, but also even the propofol used during outpatient procedures.  The withdrawal rebound happened after the drug wore off. Electric hands and feet dragged on for hours after any use of any mind-altering substance (booze only for me, but one hit of pot too)

I found the kratom withdrawal to be heavily neurological, but I experienced fewer of the severe flu symptoms one experiences on a classic opioid detox.  I didn't get the psychological depression, but I am dealing with a lack of motivation.  Overall, the kratom withdrawal was easier, but don't kid yourself, it was still uncomfortable as hell.

I'd classify myself as dealing with mild PAWS, mostly through heightened pain sensation and occasional return of electric feet (but not hands) and all of it milder.  Some motivational issues and exercise now harder cuz it hurts more to move.  Oh yeah, the cravings are there.  ""Just one 3g dose to take the pain away""   But nah.  Those withdrawals sucked enough to stay away.   I'm done.

Enough people on this thread have posted about Post Acute Withdrawal syndrome.  Here I am at the two-week mark and I got a full eight hours of sleep last night.  I can honestly say, while doing kratom chronically, I never slept more than five hours a night, and woke up regularly.   The PAWS seem manageable, other than the non-specific pain sensation that registers higher than it should.  I can practically feel the raw brain cells screaming a bit at the cold turkey detox I put them through.  They are most certainly returning the favor.   Hope this helps others.     If you take up kratom for pain, I understand.  I wouldn't take it up as a recreational endeavor though - the downside to your life outweigh the benefit.  It's not a huge high and it doesn't last long. It most certainly stops working with chronic use.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47655216}"

I wouldn't of been able to buy k in the end of June into July on my own finances. I spent my limit. But doing favors led to $ in my pocket and back to head shop, even if I had 2 clean days, once I got the $, straight to the head shop.

I was clean for 3 months in 2017 and again in 2018 (after 40 days of rehab) with a lot of shorter efforts to remain clean throughout 2016-2020…a lot of relapses.  Today marks 238 days of being kratom and alcohol free.

A word of caution for those just starting out…kratom addiction is very “cunning, baffling, and powerful”.  PAWS still shows up at the back door of my mind, but it’s getting weaker and weaker lately.  For about 5-6 months, it came as a wave of nausea, uncontrollable yawning, tearing, runny nose…and lethargy.  And it is lethargy and depression that ALWAYS precluded my relapses.  There were periods with no PAWS when I thought I had it licked…..watch out for too much confidence….kratom will continue to lurk.

I have been successful so far because of my current dislike and fear of kratom.  Last Thanksgiving, I was a psychotic mess, bottoming out on kratom…last spoonful of the evil dust on November 30th.  But the illusion of how good just 1 spoon would make me feel still comes around.

Here’s my message: use grit and determination to get through the PAWS episodes, which can be physical and/or mental.  PAWS will continue to show up uninvited, especially during stress and depression.  These episodes will always pass, but the chance of relapse goes through the roof when PAWS is working away with its torture of you.  Try to keep in the front of your mind how the last days on kratom were…use grit and determination…our minds got really fucked from kratom but they will heal with time.

I am scared. I feel like I failed so bad. 

What do I do now? I fucked up almost 3 days sober with not so bad symptoms, about to ""turn a corner"" - now I am back to square one.

The lying to my wife, sneaking, crashing moods, spending, green powder getting all over the fucking place! etc.. you guys know the deal. I won’t bore you with the details.

I cheated this time using Xanax, Phenibut, and alcohol. Tbh this is complete unsafe and not wise. I’ll admit it but I don’t regret it. Quitting Kratom is fucking hard imo.

This morning after 32 hours clear of Kratom I was able to get 50mg of Naltrexone in me. Finally a glimmer of hope.

Don’t stop addressing those issues in general that keep causing you to slip. Build a strong foundation of support and activities that are going to keep you moving forward. Get plugged in.

I've been using between 4g-20g per day for 6 months, probably around 10g a day on average.

It has been 48 hours since I quit and I am not getting full-blown withdrawal symptoms - only moderate anxiety and headaches, no flu symptoms and no real issues with sleep, etc.

I am really tempted to just stick it out, but the problem is that I just started a new job. This is a legal internship that can lead to a full position after I complete law school (in my 2nd year now) and it's so very important to me.

Usually, I would just stick it out - but I am really scared of making a bad first impression due to the moderate anxiety so I want to switch to a taper.

Some nights I've taken as little as 3.5g and felt good (before trying to quit) - so I am not sure how to proceed.

Some of the guidance in the tapering guide seems to apply to heavy users only (e.g. split into 5 doses) and taking 0.25g off each dose.

I am concerned that if I do that I will simply be extending my use.

Should I just take 1.25g total (as recommended in the guide) off my one and only dose and take the lowest adjustment period (4 days) and go like that?

Alternatively, I've been thinking of doing a quick taper - taking 0.5g off 3.5g every day. This way my taper will finish after my 1st week at the job and I will have more leeway to not be as sociable 100% of the time.

I quit via rapid taper. Suffered through the day and took a larger dose at night so I could sleep. That, with the help of matrazipine to sleep and I was off the taper in about 4 or 5 days.

The first month sucked. My physical symptoms weren't too bad, but I was mentally exhausted. I was going through a separation/divorce after 12 years, so that compounded things. I started working out the first day I quit and haven't stopped since.

I can say that exercise is the single best thing I've done to get over the post acute withdrawal.  It's a great dopamine rush and tires me out so I can sleep. I am around kratom nearly every day and have zero desire to have it.

After about 2 months, my mood started coming back. I distinctly remember sitting in my truck around March and just smiling for no reason and realizing that my emotions were coming back. To be fair, there were tough times. Times in my garage working out where'd I'd randomly cry and shit. But I worked through it.

Since then, I'm dating an awesome new girl, my sex life is off the charts, I'm in the best shape of my life, divorce is over, and my life is generally good from the time I wake up until I go to sleep.  Every one of those domains in my life was totally fucked when I was using kratom.

Quitting kratom is very doable. I had a years long addiction, and while everyone is different I highly suggest you don't get too scared at the doom and gloom stories on this sub.  At the end of the day, physical symptoms are over relatively quickly.  In the subsequent months, you MUST develop good and healthy habits or you'll relapse.. that's a feature of recovering from any addiction.

For info in how I tapered, check my previous posts. I highly suggest the method I used as it was quick, relatively painless, and extremely effective. There's no magic to it, just cut by like 75pct, and have the majority of your daily allotment right before bed. That way you go through a sort of mini withdrawals during the day and get restorative sleep at night.  My first day was 9g.  I had I think a 6g dose at night before bed.

Anyhow, my life is 1000pct improved without kratom... There was an adjustment period, for sure, but developing healthy habits, working out and exercises, and treating myself like I'm not a piece of shit really helps.",31,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5765945}"

In the past when I’ve quit CT I felt more outgoing and just generally more lively and social within a few days. I figured having done a long taper and having been on a very low dose for the last while, I would have startd to get that drive and urge to connect with people back again. But I feel more dull than ever - even more so than when I was taking 30gpd. Do you think 3-4 gpd is enough to keep you in that foggy apathetic state?

Each dose I used to take was 2 scoops per dose. I started the taper by cutting down from two scoops to one. It was much easier than it sounds and my body adjusted quickly. The next thing I did was I counted my scoops that day. I went from about 20 scoops a day to 8 on the first day just by cutting my dose down and having a little restraint. I am now down to 4 scoops a day after a little over a week and feel I could quit 100% very soon. I have been using high potency full spectrum CBD during this taper for the first time.

My therapist rarely responds and she’s booked with sessions so I don’t know how to cope so I’ve just been hanging in there, running, taking care of myself, and venting on here.

I'm going to try and taper. Does anyone know of any online resources that explain an effective tapering program? Reddit resources? Also I would like to try capsules.

In an hour I’ll be day 25. Each day I get less and less cravings! However that thought is always in the back of my head - just try it again until you graduate then go to rehab and detox there why go through this misery now? But my rational self is like…. Um f*** no. I’ve made it this far and I’d rather quit now than spend my last year of college on sludge, and have to deal with even worse withdrawal symptoms later. Yeah no thanks. Thank god I was blessed with intelligence (I don’t want to be braggy and be like omg I’m so smart) but I think it’s important in recovery from anything to remind yourself of good quality traits you have. I mean frankly I was stupid to begin taking Kratom in the first place but I was only 18, my antidepressants didn’t work and at the time dealing with a breakup, Kratom helped then turned on me and turned me into a completely different person. I felt super depressed this morning (I’m on my period this is very common even when I was on Kratom) then I felt better after I ran some errands, even cleaned up a bunch of my room. Not as bored anymore as I used to be and looking forward to my run tomorrow. I can’t enjoy video games anymore unfortunately and it’s somewhat of a trigger for me as I would enjoy being a hermit and playing video games all day, I have some enjoyment of it back but if I don’t want to play or find it triggering I put it away. I loved video games before Kratom so I’m sure I’ll love them again one day just not right now. Sorry for rambling but here’s what I want to ask about:

Dizziness. Im less in pain (minus my period cramps ugh) Sometimes I feel like everything is spinning and I believe in the first 3 days I fell. The dizziness comes and goes (usually comes at night) and worried it might be health related or maybe im just dehydrated. I certainly don’t eat enough - have a long history of anorexia nervosa so maybe it’s that as well? But never had this before when I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (prior to using Kratom when I was extremely underweight). I’m curious if it’s Kratom withdrawal induced or something else? I want to see a doctor but it’s not so severe I need to go to an ER or anything and I’m also nervous to tell the doctors I’m clean from a substance that I was abusing for a few years. Doctors look at you differently when you tell them something like that and it sucks. I’m also anemic and maybe my Kratom withdrawal was masking my anemia symptoms (iron deficient) and I’m on my period and losing blood which makes my iron levels even lower and I’ve noticed my dizziness increase. So maybe it’s anemia. I don’t know! Did anyone have dizziness 24-25 days in CT? Also I’m still a little emotionless and still kinda zombie-like just going through the motions and the days are going by fast. Want my emotions back. My libido came back temporarily for a few hours on several days now it’s gone. I do feel more attached to people though. Idk this is the weirdest fucking drug for sure. I mean I haven’t really dabbled in other substances so I’ve never withdrawn from anything besides a small dose of Ativan so I wouldn’t know but I’ve seen people here say it’s weird and symptoms are so different from person to person.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38866562}"

This is my first time trying the taper method in hopes that I won’t have to deal with the crippling anxiety and depression I’ve experienced the other times.

Luckily I somehow feel the effects at 5 grams now, which I couldn’t with less than 8 before. No idea why, but can’t complain. 

I’m getting sick of feeling shitty, so I might jump soon to get it over with. At what point should I jump to minimize physiological symptoms? Should I taper longer, or am I at a good spot now?

Any tips on meds?,"tldr: hit the wall on my taper and trying to make a plan to jump before I fuck up my job and gf leaves me. I need some meds, what has worked for you?

I tapered from 70-100 gpd down to around 10 over a few months. It was going great, I was feeling more myself, my gf was happier with me, I started doing more constructive activities, and I felt a bit more competent at work. But I hit a wall at 10. I tried to go lower and I was extremely unmotivated, lethargic, and kind of wanted to die. At that point I lost some of the willpower that I had been feeling so proud of. I haven’t gone off the deep end but have backtracked a bit in the last month or so. I’m taking around 15 gpd, have been having stronger cravings, and am deviating from my once rigid dosing schedule. 

I need to get off the roller coaster, but I’m scared of the depression and the not giving of fucks that I may encounter. I have very little PTO from work right now and I have some important assignments coming up. I have a Dr’s appointment tomorrow. I’m pretty sure they’re just going to push suboxone and I don’t think that’s the move for me at this point. I was thinking about naltrexone but I have doubts about that too. I’m reviewing old posts and reading bits of the available literature and I think I’m equipped to talk to the doc about some other helper meds, but I’m feeling pretty obsessive and want to take full advantage of this appointment.

Identify that first. You have to be ready and if you don’t feel ready, become ready! It actually dissipates the withdrawals when you start to change your mindset to feeling and thinking grateful. Try this: wake up and before you stand up think to yourself “what is the greatest ideal of myself I’d like to be today” think of who you want to be? Happy. Calm. Present. Confident. Excited. Or think of one of your goals. Becoming a millionaire, getting that job, that new car, the girl/guy of your dreams and before you get up for your day, visualize and feel the feeling of the emotion in your body of how that thing you want would FEEL. The feeling matters not just the thought. Now don’t get up for your day until you believe and feel that future has already happened and try to go throughout your day living as if that future has already happened to you. You are now living past your time. Also you can try every time you have a bad thought turning it around and changing it. And do that for a few days and see how you feel. You start to become a new you and it’s liberating. Your past no longer lives with you. It’s not easy, it’s simple. You have to have a will that’s greater than any addiction to any emotion. Life is work. Hard work. But it does pay off. Majority of people are leaves in the wind and find every easy way out to just survive! Don’t be that way. You’ve done kratom, now it’s time to be a leader to others about the low points in your life and how they led you to the high lights of your life. 

I prefer to share inspirational ideas on here rather than focusing on the detox. Yes the first 5 days suck and 2 weeks I’d say are the brunt of it roughly. We all know it’s different for us all. 

Seriously, try what I said above for a few days and let me know how it’s helped you! It’s seriously so simple. You have to undo the wiring the old you has and become a new you. You got this. It really is so much more wholesome to be a part of the real world and connect with others on a sober level. How will you ever know if any of your emotions are real if you are never sober? That’s why I stay sober. I want to know everything I feel is REAL. Deep down you want this too.

So, I took kratom for 3 years + and stopped because I was literally only taking it for feeling normal and did not have the positive effects that I used to have when I was using sub 10 gpd. 

Anyways, I abused the stuff progressively worst as time went one and decided to do a quick taper from 40-50 gpd to 20 gpd which was extremely hard and after that I kept trying to lower the dose still in a manner to not affect my social life too much but I was unable. 

After a gateway weekend with the family where I felt extremely ashamed to literally told them that I had to re dose at least every 8 hours I decided I had enough. 

So, I stopped this week where I slept the first 30 hours and waked up every 2-3 hours agonizing but weirdly passed out again. Is it normal to sleep a ton the first days even tough sleep is usually very hard to achieve for me usually?  

Also, I was too much of a pussy to keep going and started using 1,5 grams 3 times per day on day 4 because I was so tired of being in pain, don't judge me! Unfortunately the withdrawals don't seem like they are regressing to my dismay. Did I fuck up? Are the withdrawals not stopping because I did that or just because 5 days is not enough? Also, it seems like the withdrawals started to become worst on the 3rd day which is weird from what I have read on this board it usually lessened on the 3rd-4th days. Would like to know if other people have experienced similar timeline of withdrawals and when can I expect them to lessen in intensity because right now the rls is not manageable and I'm getting muscle spasms as we speak.

Usually for 3-4 months at 15-30g per day, then coming off it either tapering or cold turkey. Then 1-3 months later I'd be back.

It always created disturbing issues with my sleep that I rarely saw expressed online, but do seem to occur for some small subset of people. It was useful enough to me that I just tried to ignore them, but my most recent run December-March was the worst. After a really bad week of this crap, I decided I was done with this shit for good. But the symptoms lasted for months afterward and I started to worry that they were permanent. FWIW, I took white or green strains about 95% of the time.

These symptoms included:- Waking up with a gasp. I wouldn't be out of breath though, and tested negative twice for sleep apnea. Often these episodes would include parts of my body spasming. I don't think they were seizures though - my partner observed it a few times and said it would be over in less than a second. This happened almost every night, usually multiple times.

\- Flashes of light as I drifted to sleep that jolted me back awake. These were like hypnic jerks but much worse. The feeling I got in my head was momentary but terrible. This also happened almost every night.

\- Waking up with my heart doing flipflops or vibrating. Thankfully this only happened 2-3 times, after very heavy doses the day before. Again, it only lasted about a second.

\- Hearing voices or animals or other noises as I fell asleep. One time after a heavy kratom day I heard the word ""trauma"" whispered. Really spooked me.

\- Sleep paralysis. This was very infrequent, and only seemed to happen with reds taken shortly before bed. I didn't actually mind this one because its great for lucid dreaming, but its obviously not good its happening.

\- One instance of exploding head syndrome. Basically, I heard a very loud explosion as I was falling asleep. There was no associated pain or mental shift but it sure freaked me out.

\- Limbs randomly jerking throughout the day, aka myoclonus. This was the main negative waking symptom. I've read it is associated with opioid toxicity.

&#x200B;

I got tired of it and quit again in February. Then in March, my friend had a strain that I hadn't tried before from a vendor I never heard of. I had been off of kratom for 3-4 weeks at that point but you know how it is. Just two doses of that brought back most of these symptoms, and they were worse than ever. I later found out that another friend of mine had tried that batch and had a seizure. He has a seizure every few years, so it wasn't out of the blue, but if you look around enough you can find plenty of anecdotes online of people having seizures on kratom. That freaked me out and we tossed it and I decided I was done with this shit for good.

The sleep disturbances and myoclonus kept going, and going, and going, long after I had quit. After a month I was really worrying that I had caused some kind of permanent damage. This solidified my resolve that I was never touching this shit again. It slowly let up though, and by mid June it seemed to have almost completely stopped. I still get the gasps sometimes if I have caffeine before bed, but I feel reasonably confident that that will stop someday. I no longer have any symptoms of myoclonus either.

I also lost hair at a prodigious rate while on kratom. That also kept going for a few months, but also seemed to dwindle and then subside around the same time as the rest of the symptoms.

I'm mostly writing this to reassure others that whatever symptoms you're having long after you've quit, they will subside eventually. Just stay strong and remember that going back on it just restarts your progress, and withdrawal gets worse every time.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7330832}"

I first tried kratom in January 2020 when me and some friends who were talking about it and what we'd heard about it's effects decided to buy some heavy extract pills. The first experience was wild. It felt just like taking a strong narcotic pain killer, to me. Ive always loved the opiate feeling so I fell in love. Within a few months I was buying the strong extract shots from my local head shop every day. Not long after that I was buying 2-3 a day. The normal powder had no effect on me. I'd take 25 capsules of the normal shit just to feel a slight boost. I loved the red strains the most. I like the warm euphoria a lot more than I liked the energy. 

A few months back I snapped out of a haze I was apparently in. I discovered kratom right before covid and I was taking it daily as an escape from the day to day suck that Covid caused on most of our lives. It contributed to me losing my relationship and some friends due to my lack of focus on anything but getting another fix. About a month ago I decided that its toll on my personal life, my physical health (I used to be VERY active in terms of lifting weights and running 5-6x a week and kratom caused me to just stop doing those things in favor or taking a few shots and just relaxing after work every day) and not least importantly, my wallet. I was spending $50-$80 a day on shots.

The first week was tough. I didnt experience bad withdrawals, thankfully but I feel intense cravings and low mood. After a week, the temptation and cravings decreased a lot. Since then its been much easier. The hardest thing to overcome are the habits I created that were re-enforced by euphoria and dopamine while on kratom. I try to avoid those situations and stick to a strict healthy routine of working out and eating well. I am dealing with the emotional aspects of what I was trying to self medicate away with kratom as well. Thats key. Figure out, aside from the physical feelings you enjoy and the addictive aspects of kratom, why you are using it. If its an emotional issue like depression or avoiding working through depression type feelings like I am, you have to deal with those to ultimately succeed.",5,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4409873}"

I thought it was “harmless” and “just like coffee” but that was a lie. Before I started taking kratom, I never noticed nor cared about feeling “unmotivated” or constantly drowsy no matter how much sleep I got. I used to be able to feel normal without taking anything. After I started taking kratom I got into other drugs. These were a problem but I haven’t spent more money on anything then kratom. By late 2017 I was taking it twice a day for the whole summer. When I stopped I noticed myself feeling unmotivated, agitated, and depressed for weeks after use. I read online that these effects last for only 2 weeks. So each time I tried to quit, I’d be off for a month. But I couldn’t feel “awake” without kratom. So each time I tried to quit within the past 3 years I caved. I also feel like giving up and just spending the rest of my life on kratom. But I want to quit too. The longest I went without it was 5 months but I relied on coffee to keep me “feeling awake” and would constantly get these sensations of drowning in negative emotions to the point of physical discomfort. That lasted 5 months before I caved and started dosing again. I need a strategy to get off and stay off.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67795503}"

The next day it was in my neck and a week later it moved down to my back and it is finally starting to dissipate. My acupuncturist said my muscles most likely weren’t getting enough fresh blood so they were sending signals to my brain saying ‘we cant breathe’ causing tension in my head. This is probably due to poor posture throughout my life. It seemed my brain was in fight or flight mode cause I kept remembering a fearful memory in my past which was a bit scary.

I was working at a kratom bar and had access to unlimited quantity, making it quite a trip to try and quit. It got to a point I couldn’t walk anymore, every step shot paint through my upper leg into my hips. I would stretch 3 hours a day without much release. I would barley get any sleep. Always waking up in so much pain, unable to lay on anything soft, it would cause my lower back and hips to stiffen. I would wake up sweating 5+ times a night and had severe constipation issues from the kratom, even after making sure to only drink the brewed tea, as the powder would make it worse. I refused to believe it was all kratom induced. I thought I had chronic illnesses, some form of arthritis. After hitting an all time low I found this forum and saw others struggling and told myself I was willing to give up my “life source” if it meant I could have my old life back. It was not easy. At all. The first couple of weeks were obviously the worst, and working in a kratom shop made it that much more of a challenge. Took me 3 months until I had a proper working digestion again. Started sleeping comfortably after also about 3 months. The pain in my legs slowly reversed. I became stronger, I quit nicotine with my new found strength. EVERY single day for 9 months was a win.

Hi, this is where I am starting this process, I hope that's okay and thank you for being my witnesses. I’ve been using for about 3 years now, weekly at first and then eventually daily. At this point I’m probably taking 40 to 50 gpd, divided between two doses. My plan is to taper but I can't bring myself to start, partially because I'm an athlete and I have no idea how to work withdrawal into my training schedule. No one knows about my habit except my husband, and I only came clean with him a few weeks ago.

Over the past 3 years, kratom has had quite an impact on my life. It’s caused my mental health to yoyo wildly, it's blown my anxiety out of control, it’s turned my once lush brown hair into a thinned-out scraggly mess, it’s made it impossible to focus on work, it’s made my already abysmal eating habits even worse (I get kratom munchies SO bad, and all I crave is sugar), I've lost my sex drive, my affect keeps flattening more and more, I can't write anything because all of my passion is gone...I could go on and on. I feel like I have completely handed control of myself over to a stupid ass drug, again, for the nth time. 

And the withdrawals….oh, the withdrawals. I did dope every day for five years and quit cold turkey, and the withdrawals for that were nothing compared to this. I can’t make it past \~20 hours cold turkey from kratom, because the things I feel, both physically and mentally, are so uncomfortable and disturbing that I don’t know if I could make it out the other side with my sanity intact. The anxiety, the derealization, the weird exhaustion you feel at first followed by the insomnia at night, the bizarre distressing dreams, the spontaneous sexual arousal that often manifests in upsetting and surreal ways, not to mention all of the physical symptoms. It’s a hellscape. 

I’ve known about this subreddit for awhile but never posted because I didn’t want my husband to find out I was still using kratom. But he knows now, and I have nothing to hide. So hello, nice to meet you, please tell me it’s going to be okay, because right now it feels like it won’t ever be again. Please tell me I can be clean again before I get too old, and that my hair will grow back, and that the mental health impact of this addiction is only temporary.

It might change in a few hours though and I’ll have to suck it up but I decided to start running 5 days a week instead of 3-4, so I’ll be running again today.
My productivity levels have increased and I can think more clearly and get more work done. While I’m a bit more anxious and still sweat and have some physical symptoms lingering, it’s gotten better. Saved $153 in 23 days, money I would’ve spent on Kratom. Money was never really an issue, I don’t want to sound like a snob but I’m a college student rn with no job because I just wasn’t interested in getting one for the summer (because of my lack of motivation) and my parents aren’t rich rich but they make good money (moms a dentist, dads a corporate lawyer, they work all week and pay for everything). So I always felt guilty when I said I needed $20 for food when in reality I was spending that $20 on Kratom at my smoke shop. One day I’ll pay them back for my mistakes. Im glad that guilt is gone, and they’ve noticed I’ve been spending less money. I used Kratom to self medicate my depression and anxiety (was never addicted to opioids) and my antidepressants never worked, but maybe they’re working better now that I’m clean. Im no longer slurring my words, can think sharper, memory is better. I was worried about school and how I’d perform but I think my memory will be a lot better off Kratom. 
I still do have cravings but there’s no going back. Last night was emotionally terrible but it comes in waves and I knew the feeling would pass so I just distracted myself best I could. And it did pass. Tonight I could feel like shit again. And that’s ok. I keep on trooping to a happier and healthier life. And music sounds so much better. Not to the point yet where I want it to be because I still have some brain fog I guess but it’s gotten better. Still have feelings of wanting to cry but can’t but was able to cry this morning and I’m not pushing myself to cry, just letting it happen naturally. Starting to think old thoughts and picking up old habitual thoughts I was thinking prior to starting Kratom fleetingly. Memories are coming back. It’s no fun, but I’ve made it this far and I’m proud. So keep going. I still have lingering thoughts of “when will this get better” etc. And not believing people when they say “it will get better in time” but I’m *slowly* starting to believe that.

I was feeling so good about it, and amazed at how relatively easy it was. Then I got stuck. I went up to 3gpd the next few days, and even that didn't feel like enough. Then two nights running I awoke at 3am and gave into the urge and dosed just to go back to sleep. Yesterday I managed to keep it at 3g, and here I am today.

Actually, so far today I've had nothing. Last dose (half a gram) was 16 hours ago, before bed, and I feel fine. I woke up last night and wanted to take some, but I resisted it.

Anyhow, I'm feeling a bit ashamed and helpless to get below the 2.5g-3g limit.

My question is: is it generally better for adjusting the body by taking a single dose, or spreading it out? I have been trying to spread it out - three doses a day - which is why it's so hard to get below 3g. Maybe if I just dose at bed time? Nights are the hardest for me...

I had been tapering down from 50 GPD over the course of two months and had gotten down to 15 GPD. 

After the naltrexone incident, I decided to stay CT and stick with it. I’ve been taking naltrexone almost every night before bed since then in doses varying from 3 - 12 mg. I’ve been using kratom for ten years and have tried quitting several times before. I can say that, for me, this has been the single most helpful quitting aid I’ve tried. It has almost entirely eliminated cravings and a lot of the effects of PAWS I’ve struggled with in the past. 

I was curious whether there were some other variables making this quit much easier than previous attempts, so I experimented with forgoing the naltrexone for a couple of days last week. Lo and behold, cravings came back strong.

Yes please continue to workout and eat right and take supplements if you are, and if you arent, DO IT! But also, meditate! I highly recommend Dr. Joe Dispenza. Look up some of his YouTube stuff. If you’re interested I can send a link to his meditations and work. Even just sitting still for 10 minutes a DAY closing your eyes feeling gratitude for your life and what you DO have will help you tremendously, and staying conscious of your thoughts staying positive throughout your day and doing that for several days will help you get through this battle a lot easier! Even if you go negative just switch it around. That is a victory! Seriously, it IS that simple. Focus on your energy and your thoughts, NOT your suffering! You got this.

I was using an RC chemical (and alcohol throughout) for a couple months before I realized I needed to stop using the RC and turned to Kratom to help. It did the job, but I never stopped the Kratom.

The alcohol has become a real problem again and I decided to take up naltrexone to combat that, but cannot start without 10 days clean from Kratom. And so today is day 5.

Unlike previous Kratom quits I felt like the withdrawals have become worse over time instead of better -- although I'm still relatively early in the process so that might not be so unusual? The first 3 days were actually OK, but I have barely slept since then. Last night (post day 4) I slept just an hour despite sleeping meds and woke up drenched in sweat. I had kind of hoped the insomnia would start to get better by now, not worse.

I mainly am typing this out to help anyone who may be debating whether they should make the jump or not, but I’m also putting it in words to help myself grasp everything I’ve been through this week. 

If anyone has any vices at all, or things holding them back, drop it. You can get on just fine, hour by hour, minute by minute, with one foot in front of the other. Sure, you’re going to have to pay the piper, but the relief you feel after climbing out of the other side of the hole, staring into the sun; it’s phenomenal. 

I had 10 days off of work, so I just said screw it and dumped every last thing I had that was altering my mentality and emotions. I had been using kratom for three or four years now, same with nicotine. Caffeine would offset the negatives of those two and so the cycle would continue.

I won’t lie to you, the first four days were hell. It felt like I was tripping balls, vision pulsing like crazy and the feeling like I’m constantly on some type of “edge”. Could barely sleep, would sweat bullets but also be cold and frigid at the same time. On the fourth day, I forced myself to workout. Then, I worked out a little harder the next day and so on. It’s helped tremendously.

Anyways, I feel pretty good today. Sat in a sauna for a few hours. Cravings always come back to kick my ass but I let myself feel them fully and tell myself “no”. I also didn’t use any helper meds. Imo, you have to pay your dues and embrace the suck. It forces you to remember why you’ll never get stuck in that hole again.

This board was instrumental in helping through it the first time, and I tried to chime back in every once in awhile with words of encouragement throughout the clean years, though even thinking about kratom never stopped giving me that little twinge (you know the one) so I mostly avoided even thinking about it.  I'm realizing now that I never really did the work to address the issues that drove me to this shit to begin with (though my health issues are ever present and will always be a driving force in seeking relief) so I was pretty much the kratom addict equivalent of what the AA people call a ""dry drunk"" (I was never an alcoholic, but have plenty of experience with people in those programs and have read about them a lot).  Maybe 6 months before I caved, the corner store by my house started carrying kratom, and the second I saw that I knew I was fucked.  I fought it valiantly for quite awhile, but when the pandemic hit, it was the best excuse we could ever give ourselves to be locked away in our kratom caves again.  It didn't even take 4 days of lockdown for me to buckle, and like everyone else, I never expected it to last that damn long, so after over a year I'm in DEEP.  

I did a very sharp taper from Sunday to now (day 1 of zero kratom only 3 days later) and last night was easily one of the worst nights of my life.  I took x5 1gr doses evenly spaced throughout the day yesterday, but my body completely flipped out by about 3am.  I get RLS sometimes even while clean, but last night I had the worst regular RLS I've ever had, and in addition to that it felt like there were mice in my hip bones for some damn reason, which is a new and especially horrifying development.  I was having South Park Lemmywinks style dreams where there were mice running around inside my bones, then I'd wake up thrashing on the floor.  It was fucking horrible, but I woke up feeling surprisingly good considering that hellacious night and decided to start day 1 early (I took off from work Friday and had that marked as day 1 of zero kratom).  I don't think it's possible to have a worse night than that (sans full on fever dementia) so there's no need to prolong it with doses so small they barely help, anyway.  I still have plenty of kratom and have yet to do the toilet dumping ceremony, but that's coming today.  

There is a new development that helped to drive me to quit this time, and that was smoking CBD buds.  (Don't stop reading here if that doesn't appeal to you, because it's not all that integral to the point.)  I haven't been a fan of weed since I was a teenager, but a friend of mine who has a CBD farm gave me a bunch, and it had a pretty dramatic effect on me.  I'm sure that also being on kratom whenever I smoked it played a significant role, but almost right away my inner monolog returned, and I started cracking myself up with random nonsense again (which is like MY THING, but kratom eventually takes that away, too).  I'm completely miserable and have been gearing myself up to quit again anyway, but I didn't think I was ready yet, and smoking that CBD was like a quick flash of what my mind is like when it's not artificially depressed.  In general, my body reacts very differently to outside substances than normal people so I'm not suggesting this route to anyone else, but getting a reminder of what my brain is like when the gears start turning again was a HUGE development.  At first I was thinking that I'd just start smoking all the time in addition to doing kratom, but it was pretty clear that what I liked about it were the little glimpses of normalcy that I can achieve without outside help, so it worked as a catalyst to quit entirely.  I'm deciding to interpret this as follows: When we're deep in it, we're all miserable.  A huge percentage of us started taking this shit because something was quite wrong beforehand and we were seeking relief, but who the fuck can say, after a significant amount of time on it, that kratom has made their life BETTER?  There are caveats to that, of course (I know there are people with pain disorders or other major health issues who'd be FORCED to take worse drugs if not for kratom, so they're obvious exceptions) but there is no question whatsoever that my life goes into a downward spiral every time I start back up, and comes back when I quit.  If you're in it now, try to remember what it was like to actually feel your emotions, to think quickly on your feet, to not start every day of your life finding excuses not to leave the damn house.  Remember what it's like to have real connections with people, and not have to worry about getting slurry wasted after only a couple drinks at a work function or on a date.  These are SELF INFLICTED INJURIES, and we all know it.

Of course everyone is different, but not every story is a horror story.

&#x200B;

I have been using 30-35 gpd for the last 2 years, this was split between 4 doses. I started tapering exactly a month ago (30-31 days in). The first drop I did was to 15gpd on day one. This really kicked my butt, but I was ok since I was tapering and I could control the amount I was intaking. Meaning, wd's got bad I would take a gram or so to alleviate the symptoms. Throughout my tapper the first 2-4 days had the worst acute, and they were completely manageable since I still had control over my tapering.

I always dosed with a scale right from the start of my use, so I always knew exactly how much I was dosing. Scales are a must for tapering, you can do without but remember your body will respond to .1 grams. So you want to be accurate especially once you start going down to the sub 5gr dosing. Fast foreword 30 days and I jumped when my last 3 days were 3.42 / 3.28/1.9 gr consecutively. I went straight into PAWS without any acutes. The taper even though was a pretty quick one, allowed my brain to acclimate to the lower doses step by step and I am assuming that is why I did not go through the acutes. 

&#x200B;

On a side note I also quit vaping along side of this. 4th day CT off vaping as well, this also kicked my butt a bit, but a walk in the park in comparison to K. I only vaped for a year but heavily going through 2 pods of 50mg/ml a day.

If you have the willpower to taper please do so, it will make your life more manageable.

Things that helped me:

A high quality multivitamin (Progressive for active men)

Hydrating packets ( including electrolytes + vitamins)

My God, the cravings have been awful. Almost every day since day 62 I've been driving to the shop, buying it, mixing up a drink, and just staring at it for a while. Both hating myself for being weak, and also fighting against the demon that tells me it's okay to take it. Anyhow, SOMEHOW I HAVE NOT CAVED. I honestly am amazing myself with my strength. That's one big silver lining from all this suffering. 

Yesterday I woke up fiending and did the cycle (drove, bought, mixed, contemplated), poured it down the drain. Then in the afternoon I DID IT AGAIN. I went to the shop, bought some, etc. I was the closest I have ever been to caving staring at that paper cup. Literally it was hours of pacing, looking at it, smelling it (of course it both looks and smells like poison or something that would drip out of the compost bin), and then pacing some more thinking about how it all would play out. Again, I eventually poured it down the drain. I felt a bit of a shift then. Maybe it was just my brain being like ""alright buddy, come on. if we're not doing this then stop jerking me around and move on"". Today the cravings have still been there but I feel like I passed a test and things are not as tough.

Since my sobriety and my relationship with K is most of what I think about all day nowadays one thought that's come to me recently is this: **I think perhaps part of the reason we have such trouble ""finding ourselves"" during a quit is that we are constantly changing. This change is more easily quantified and understood when sober, but when you've been high for so long and come clambering back to sobriety at first you look for a person who is no longer there.** Not in a sad way, but rather in a happy way. Whoever you land on is just fine because you would have been a different person at this point even if you never messed with kratom. Idk, just a thought.

some of you may remember me as I used to post a lot at the beginning of my quitting journey. I do not post much anymore as I am finally catching on with my life. I've been clean since April 12 which puts me at slightly above 3 months. I was using for 11 months at anywhere between 15 to 25gpd, I did scale down to about 15 to 18gpd for the last 4 months of use. This may not sound like that much of a use, but I got pretty dependent on it. I knew I had to quit but could not do it until I started having panic attacks out of the blue on kratom, it turned on me big time. So from there I tapered quickly for 2 weeks and jumped at about 2-3gpd. 

I won't bore you guys with the details, but frankly the first 2 months were pure hell. This is literally by far the hardest thing that I've done. I have never been dependent on anything in my life and I had no idea what this ""miracle herb"" will do to me. I've had all the things you can imagine and more, other than RLS (yes, for some reason I was spared of it). My worst symptoms were unrelenting ""out of this world"" anxiety and panic. That includes both mental and physical aspects - racing heart, chest pain, lightheadedness, sweating, shaking, insomnia, derealisation/depersonalization, head pressure and buzzing, jitters, skin crawling, diarrhea/nausea, etc and etc. I have always had anxiety but this was 20 on a scale of 1 to 10. I was in the ER 3 times (nothing was found of course). Frankly, I thought that I will just lose my mind and die. It was truly, absolutely, without a shade of a doubt awful. 

But I did not lose my mind and I survived. Things started noticeably turning for the better at about 2 months. By 3 months I felt pretty good. Not 100% but about 85% to 90%. Then this past Friday I've had a little bit more alcohol then I should have, and that triggered a setback with anxiety. But I am getting back on track it seems. Note to self (and to others) - GO EASY on alcohol in recovery. If you drink at all, limit yourself to a little. For me it is no more than 2 drinks, but find your personal limit. I never had problems with alcohol so I am not worried about that, however it goes without saying that for a person with alcohol related problems in the past, it is better to not drink at all. 

HELPER MEDS

I did not use much quite honestly. A little bit of propranolol here and there, some trazodone for sleep for a few weeks, along with melatonin and valerian root. A little bit of magnesium for leg cramps and a multivitamin. That's about it. I tried to start an SSRI at some point but it kicked my butt with side effects (it always does), so I quit after 2 weeks. It might have helped eventually, but I just could not get over the initial side effects. I did take klonopin 3 times but I don't like how ""zombified"" it makes me feel, and frankly the prospect of addiction to benzos is absolutely terrifying, so I don't recommend it. Use propranolol before you resort to benzos, that may be enough to take the edge off. It did help me. All in all, not to be cliché but the safest and easiest way out of this is to ""embrace the suck"" and not try to make it painless. 

EPILOGUE

No matter how bad it feels in the first weeks or months after quitting, it DOES GET BETTER. It will take me a few more months (at least) to feel fully back to normal, but that's OK. Helps me remember why I quit and why I need to stay quit. On the flip side, I can finally enjoy life again. I take pleasure and fun in doing silly things with my kids, like going on a water slide or jumping on a trampoline. I look forward to the actual things to do, and not to taking my next dose of kratom. Slowly, little by little, it keeps getting better. I was terrified that it never will, and maybe I am 1 in a zillion of people who will now never be normal again. Nope. I will be, it just takes time. And YOU WILL BE TOO. Believe it. Most importantly, BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. I am being cliché again, but I can't find anything else to say. You will not be stuck in this hell forever. 

Good luck my friends. I probably won't be on here much but I will post an update at 6 months. Cheers all, yours truly,

I’ve been a closet user for 6 years. I quit once 3 years ago for 3 months, but found some old stash – thought I could nibble a bit and was wrong. I have been trying to get off K for a while now, but as we all know it’s not easy. No-one knows the extent of me using (when I quit the first time I let my partner know, but she is unaware of the relapse in the last 3 years), I usually went through 1 – 1.5 kg of powder per month -> I guess I  30-50 gbd habit give or take. 

The longest time I have been free of K in the last three years is now – I had brief times (14 days) where I did not use (when I went overseas to visit family), and I am still angry I basically went straight back after returning. My other attempts to CT were unsuccessful as I usually had to return to work after a week and was mentally so exhausted that I fell into it again quite fast. 

This time I planned a very long vacation (4 weeks) and basically jumped with the start of the vacation, by going into the country side (and reducing the intake the day before the holiday started to a bare  minimum). That helped me a lot. While the first week was uncomfortable but manageable, I think I went straight into PAWS, feeling really low in energy, moody etc.. Being in nature and having access to a cold lake, as well as biking around, helped a lot to battle these feelings. 

I am back in the city now, stocked up on vitamins and dietary supplements and things are getting better by the day – especially l-tyrosin is helping me to feel less lethargic + being ‘forced’ by my partner to do city things like going into museums etc and thus getting in 10k+ steps a day. 

I have been sneezing a lot in the last weeks, but this is now getting better as well, today the sneeze count is 1, yesterday it was like 6, and the day before 12ish. My appetite is also a bit of a problem, I am one of those users who lost a lot of weight due to K (delaying food to not compromise a dose), also I had to dose before and after food otherwise I would feel a bit sick. I can now moderately eat things without that feeling, but I guess getting back to normal portions just takes time. 

So far I didn’t have any cravings (I didn’t have them the first time I stopped either, I however was stupid enough to think I could control it …). It’s gonna be interesting when returning to work in 1.5 weeks, I used K. to work longer and more and motivate + reward myself after work, so let's see how this will go – one day at a time.

I just can’t go back to using, I am moody now, but I was moody/lethargic when using too. I wasted so much time, energy, and trust (from friends employers, and loved ones). Unbeknownst to all, I got married on K, I buried my dad on K, got promoted on K., etc etc. this has to stop.  

Anyways thanks for reading! Also thanks for this sub, it helps a lot to see one is not alone, and also that things get better by the day. Keep fighting the good fight! If I can do it you can do it! Godspeed!",16,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4796322}"
2021-07-20 10:24:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/oo31mx/day_53_ct_just_wanted_to_provide_a_positive/,Day 53 CT. Just wanted to provide a positive withdrawal experience!,"Hey guys! Just like product reviews, I figure there's an inherent bias in quitting communities that skew towards negative withdrawal experiences, since people who have it easy would be less likely to post about it. So, I thought it was super important that I share what I went through these last couple months in the hopes that I can add a little light to the scariness of the sub. (Not at all discounting or invalidating people's horror stories, of course!!)

I was taking somewhere between 2-12ish gpd for about two years. It could've been more than that during some months but I honestly just eyeballed it 99% of the time so it's hard to say. Whenever I measured my doses it was generally a couple grams tho, and I would dose at least once and up to five times. I was taking kratom for mood and motivation purposes, hence the smaller doses. I think this is why I didn't really experience much physical withdrawal symptoms aside from fatigue, runny nose and sneezing, and a few bouts of nausea. It was the mental symptoms that nearly did me in, and they lasted right up until Day 30 in varying degrees.

While I was taking K I went through several major life transitions and evolutions that helped me become a much better person. I started working out regularly, stopped partying and began my alcohol sobriety journey, graduated college after getting fantastic grades for the last few semesters, and I wrote two novels. All of this made me fall down a really frightening thought pattern of attributing wayyyy more of my successes to kratom's aid than necessary. I started to really believe that it was kratom that helped me stay sober from alc, or that gave me the motivation to do all those great things, or that kept my mental health issues in check.

But I was wrong. Those were just THOUGHTS, not my reality. If you take a look through my post history you'll see I was really struggling at first, paralyzed by the idea that I'd ruined my brain for months or even forever, and that I'd never be motivated or creative again. But none of that was true. The addictive properties of kratom had definitely rewired my brain to get nasty cravings, but the mental withdrawal for those first few weeks I truly believe was just my brain's last ditch effort to make me miserable enough to cave and go buy K. Once I realized that, and just decided to ride it out and hope for the best... it all changed. 

By Day 30, I was 80% my normal self again. I still felt very slow mentally sometimes and found it hard to communicate with others and deal with my new raging emotions that weren't being constantly numbed anymore. I also lost my sobriety streak for alcohol. BUT, the cravings were mostly gone and I knew I needed to soldier on. Once I reached Day 40, I can confidently say I was near 100% back to my normal self. Now I almost want to say it's over 100% because I truly believe I've IMPROVED as a person since quitting. I'm motivated, I'm creative, and I'm thriving.

Now, I don't know why some people have horrible, long-lasting effects and others don't, and I will not pretend to know. However, I CAN tell you what kinds of things that I did that I think really helped me:

1. I continued to workout. Most days of the week, even if it was just a walk. This was the most important habit early in the process since it got my opioid centers back up and running and helped me feel ""normal."" Hard cardio and strength training help SO MUCH.
2. I ate really healthy. I let myself have some sugar and not-so-healthy snacks as well for the comfort, but my main meals were mostly balanced and packed with nutrients.
3. I took a B-complex, L-theanine, and magnesium.
4. This one might not be the best advice for everyone, but to avoid nighttime boredom I took a bit of a Delta-8 THC gummy before bed so I could chill out and watch some TV without that nagging empty feeling or anxiety.
5. I gave myself the time and space to just take a break and recover. Putting pressure on myself to feel a certain way, act a certain way, or be majorly productive was the worst thing I did in that first month. When I gave myself that time and space, it made all the difference. Your brain and body need time to rewire and reset. Pressure only makes things worse.
6. Once I was starting to feel a bit better, I made sure that I challenged myself to do things I believed I ""couldn't do anymore"" like be creative and write. Once I realized that was false, it helped me a lot to push forward and believe I could feel normal again.
7. I cleaned my space and got rid of clutter and mess. You have no idea the difference a physical fresh start of our environment makes to our brains. I even made a little ritual of it--clearing out the old to make way for the new--and just made sure my room and working space were nice and clean and organized.
8. I journaled. It was really ugly, but I did it. Writing out all my horrible thoughts helped to distance myself from them. I started telling myself a different narrative--that I didn't HAVE to be broken for months. And so I wasn't. (Again, not saying that people who struggle for months can journal their way out of it obviously, just saying it was helpful to believe that my fate wasn't decided based on other people's experiences.)
9. I meditated, read tarot cards, and reconnected to my emotions through my spiritual path. This is very individual, and I know many of you might not be spiritual or religious in the slightest, but I'd still recommend some kind of practice of just sitting with yourself, talking it out out loud (as silly as that sounds), and rebuilding an inner relationship with your thoughts that is more positive and constructive. Our brains are POWERFUL. What we tell them they very often believe. So it's important to be still and go inwards every once in a while. It's important to ask yourself what you really need and follow through.

I feel like there's a lot more I can say but this is long enough already! I'd say all of those were the most important tools. Hang in there, guys! Even if your experience was genuinely horrific compared to mine, I hope you can find just one nugget of helpfulness that will improve your outlook. The depression and anxiety was relentless those first 30 days, but I realize now that kratom was causing me horrible anxiety of its own with dissociative symptoms, numbness, brain fog, etc. Living life with a clear mind is beautiful and I wouldn't trade it for anything.",56,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46892315}"

Been using anywhere from 20 to 100 gpd for the past few years, and before that I drank like a fish.

""You're not good at making friends. You don't have any hobbies. If you get sober you are going to be bored and lonely and miserable. You'd be better off just ending it all. Get rid of the pain, only drugs or permanent sleep will do that. So take your pick.""

It's absolutely horrible, but after 3 weeks of this garbage going through brain I managed to escape it long enough last week to ask for help. I told my family I needed help (again) and they all supported me a great deal. I luckily found a doctor willing to prescribe suboxone, and also have found the willpower to not abuse that instead of the kratom. Have an appointment with a therapist tomorrow, if I don't fix the underlying anxiety and depression then I am going to just keep coming back. For the first time I am getting sober with this major feeling of excitement to be sober instead of a longing to just continue using. It's an amazing feeling.

I had to find this place while using before I could quit tho. I tried quitting when I was in the pits of despair, and it didn't work. So I continued to use but did all the other good things to start turning my brain around (working out, eating healthy, trying to socialize, picking up old hobbies). And it helped so much. Instead of feeling scared and helpless, I feel excited. I'm ready to take my life back and to learn how to actually deal with life without some sort of high going all day.

So day 4, here I am (kinda). I'm on suboxone for 10 days, then total sobriety. I gotta make it stick this time, this cycle is getting really tiring.

I invited that in and my mind quieted and my heart softened. 💗 I felt ok in that moment and held myself in love.

I don’t think it matters where we are in our recovery, or if we have even started. Self compassion and holding ourselves in love is the only way to peace.

I was so scared to quit.  My anxiety levels were crazy this past year and a half.

The strangest thing is my anxiety levels are the best they have been since the quit.  I used Kratom for 5 years and quit 3 times.  Every time I quit I had cravings and it was horrible.

No cravings and I think the acutes are almost over.  I just can’t sleep.  I was so afraid to fly home and see my family and quit.  I almost didn’t do it.  It wasn’t me talking, it was my addiction.  It’s funny how Kratom gets into your brain and controls your thoughts.  I remember sitting there 8 days ago and realizing I wasn’t in control of my thoughts.  It scared me.  I wanted to go home.  Something clicked in me and I quit.

I’m just hoping I can get one good night's sleep before my flight. I keep saying it again the fear of quitting is worse than quitting.  If you are afraid of quitting are you really afraid or is that just addiction talking?  When I had this thought it hit me hard and helped me quit.

I’m not sure why my withdrawals were so mild.  I only took vitamin c and worked out.  I keep thinking maybe I get hit hard the second week. The only thing I can think of is I’m in decent shape.  I never used opioids before outside of maybe a surgery.  After experiencing this, thank God I never did.  

I like to run long-distance races.  The hardest thing I ever did was run a marathon during a heatwave in Europe.  It was 90C at the start of the race.  People kept collapsing around me.  Somehow I made it to the end.  It took me a week to recover from that race.  I was so depleted.  It taught me that no matter how bad you feel, you can keep going.  The human mind is a powerful thing.  I had up and down moments this week, but I stayed focused on the finish line.  A life free of Kratom.  

I don’t tell you this to brag.  I’m no different from you.  I’m not special.  I’m telling you this because one of you might be in the thic of it struggling.  You got this!  Just keep putting one foot in the front of the other.  No matter how bad you feel, it won’t last forever. The doom and gloom isn’t real . It’s just the addiction talking.

But even at day 50 it seemed I still hadn't regained myself.  I am so upset that I permanently screwed myself.  I dont feel like me.  I cant have sex without taking a sildenafil and am afraid my drive will never come back.  I experienced a brief surge for a couple days after I quit back in May.  Then it went and I was depressed and got prescribed venlafaxine.  That killed my drive even further. I switched to wellbutrin and I think that is what gave me crushing anxiety and left me to relapse.  Now Im trying to stop everything.  I quit drinking 5 years ago successfully and but Kratom has been so much harder and more damaging. I feel like a hopeless failure and I'll never be back to myself and will lose my wonderful current relationship.  Anyways.... could use some hope.

Towards the end I felt like a stinkin zombie and couldn’t believed I spent close to $9000 in the last year.  It was time to quit.  Tried CT with some length of time twice before but never a CT with extract.  Was able to get to two extract capsules a day and then jumped.  

This time around it’s been different.  I was hoping after 8 days CT my orgasm is would come back heal on like they did last time.  This time around I don’t have much sexual desire and can’t cum easily.  Makes me a bit sad cause I always loved that part of CT.

Other thing different is I’ve been having diarrhea nonstop for 25 days.  Sleep is wonderful cause I take 100mg trazadone before bed.  I wake up everyday at 7am wide awake but still no energy.

Most days I’m very happy and talkative.  Other days I wanna lay in bed all day and be antisocial.  Guess you take the good with the bad.

First of all, thanks for being such an active and supportive group. There are so many fantastic, helpful people who are also going through this, and that fact has really helped me not vilify myself for finding myself in this situation.

I'm on day 9 CT, and it's definitely getting easier, as the worst of the paws have faded into the background. I wanted to ask about a specific side effect, namely sexual function. Many people have reported a resurgence of the libido upon cessation, which has been the case for me. However, there is one glaring issue for me: as most of you have probably experienced, climax is incredibly difficult and time intensive on kratom. However, now that I am off kratom, I find that I climax much too quickly. This was not an issue for me prior to kratom use. 

I'm thinking that this is likely just a product of my overall neurological reset and I'll likely return to baseline over time. However, as you might imagine, it is a point of concern. I'm just wondering how many people have experienced this issue post-cessation of kratom, and if so, is there anything you did to deal with this particular issue?

First: Figure out how much to take in a day before you start to taper. If you're like me, you have a ballpark idea, but it's almost certainly off. I know it's not pleasant staring the amount you use directly in the face, but *it's okay* we all start somewhere. Your first drop is going to be much smoother if you know how much you are actually dropping.

My mistake: I assumed I was taking 25 gpd tops, so I dropped to 15 immediately. The truth was that I was probably more like 35-40 gpd. So that first drop really hurt. To the point that I had to pull back after a few days. Still ended up decreasing my gpd, but I felt defeated and down on myself when I had to pull back.

Second: Agmatine, this stuff really is an amazing tapering tool. It can help you drop faster and increase dose frequency easier too. **BUT** if you've started agmatine to help your taper *don't stop taking it* until you've stabilized at your new lower dose. I've been taking it 3x a day. Once in the morning, once halfway through the day, and once before bed. Some folks don't like taking it before bed, but I've found that it can help you sleep longer before waking up in mild-WD.

My mistake: I assumed the agmatine wasn't really doing anything, that I was just having an easy drop, despite it being a 12gpd drop. So two days in I stopped taking it, and was hit with some crappy WD.

How do you know you've stabilized on a new dose? I think this is different for everyone. For me, once my number twos are somewhat solid I consider myself to be more or less stabilized. For a 10gpd drop, that took a good five days.

Note, that while the drop should be easier, the chills and the fire worms in your skin shouldn't be there most of the time, you're still not going to feel *normal.* For me, I'm still dealing with increased anxiety, though it's much more manageable than when I dropped w/o the agmatine.

So that's it. Again, YMMV. I'm not an expert. Just made a number of mistakes in the last two weeks and hope my experience can help a few others avoid the same.

I have had chronic insomnia for years (before I even knew what kratom was) and I hardly sleep (usually up for 2-4 days before I can get about 5 hours of sleep).

Buddy of mine introduced me to kratom 3 years ago, and I used it to get off of alcohol (was drinking basically everyday). Well, when he introduced me to it, I was going through the police academy. Once I became I police officer, i kept taking more and more. The more shit I saw, the worse my depression got, the more kratom I would take to help with it. I saw a lot of shit, so I kept taking more kratom (only when I got off of duty, not during. Never took it once while on duty). 

Left the PD after a year because it was wrecking my mental state. My depression was at all time high, while my sleep was at a all time low. Ended up having tk get checked into the ED one day after I had been up 5 days straight and was having audible/visual hallucinations. 

So now I'm on day 3 of quitting, haven't slept since Saturday morning, and I feel like I'm going crazy. I have general discomfort, but laying in bed all night trying to sleep and tossing and turning doesn't help.

Im prescribed 60mg of prozac a day, and 2mg of klonopin and doxepin for sleep (literally have tried all the big name sleep meds like ambien and zoloft and trazadone, along with 5 other ones, but they don't work). 

I just feel like I need to get this off my chest, and typing this up actually is making me feel better. 

I kept telling myself last night I was just going to get up this morning and walk to the local smoke shop (not even a quarter of a mile away and it's brand new, go figure they'd build one so close to me, a addict lol.) Thankfully it's piss pouring rain right now and I'm not about to walk in the rain. Can't drive for 6 months because I had a seizure last month, and I think it was from a kratom overdose even though the Dr said it was a ""insomnia provoked seizure"". 

I'm not a very social person here lately since I can't drive. Really the only thing I enjoy is listening to audio books, reading, video games, and target shooting (can't really do that much more cause of ammo prices). Once in a blue moon I'll go to my brother's place to stay and hangout with him, or I'll go to a friend's house, but it's not very often. I hate being stuck in one place, it sucks, and now doing kratom CT doesn't help with that.

I am on day 26 of my taper, my 2nd consecutive day at 10GPD (2G x 5 doses per day), down from 30-40GPD+ (let's be real, probably more like 50GPD most days). Tapering has been... interesting. My very first day of tapering I immediately cut to 17GPD, quickly realized that it was too fast, and then slowed way down, and now here we are at 10GPD. I'm feeling really good about my progress, even though the side effects have been less than fun. Since I slowed down, I have been sleeping a little better (albeitvwaking up SUPER early every day), bad stomach issues still persist, mood swings, and temperature changes constantly, but I am learning to live with it.

I'd really like to make the jump next weekend. I have a 3 day (F-S-S) weekend coming up and I will have the house completely to myself, which is rare. In a perfect word, I would like to continue to taper down to maybe ~8GPD, take my last dose Thursday evening, then sweat it out over the next three days, and return to work on Monday.

My question for all of my fellow Taperers out there: When did you decide that enough was enough and it was time to jump? I'd really like to get this over with, and I know jumping from ~10GPD is gonna suck, but I just want to rip the band aid off!

Any insight would be greatly appreciated. I am proud of myself so far but I know I have some dark days ahead of me. It ain't over yet! No wrong answers here, just looking for a birds-eye-view of my situation.

Last time I vacation quit i ended up picking up on my way back into town but this time feels different. Idk about anyone else's chemistry but when I'm using kratom, cannabis is absolutely unbearable. I went away to a legal state and so I was able to use thc products of all types and I have to say it helped a lot. I'm going back to work tomorrow so we'll see how she goes. I'm feeling pretty good but it's the not good feelings that I need to get used to. We got this y'all. The reason I ever got stuck in this green dirt in the first place is the real challenge. I don't know what living healthy looks like but it feels like a matter of survival to not go back to my standard pacifier.

I was surprised to find people who feel exactly like me. Today is the day I’ve decided to take my life back. This is going to be long but bare with me.    

I was introduced to kratom when I was 18 by a co worker. I was tired and had a 12 hour shift ahead of me. Just like everyone else I took three capsules ( which people have been saying is close to .5 grams each capsule) and I thought I had found the key to life. Ever since that day I haven’t gone a single day without it. At first it was great my productivity was at an all time high and I had wished I found the herb earlier. Im not here to bash the plant I believe it is great but not when you have an addictive personality. I used to be addicted to coffee and I would sleep with a keurig next to my bed. I got withdrawals if I didn’t have it. It got to the point where coffee rarely did anything to me and I didn’t even like the taste anymore I was just drinking it to feel normal. I kicked that addiction just to fall into kratom addiction a couple of years later. I am now 21 and taking 20 + capsules a day. Sometimes I get the results I want so I convince myself to take a little more so it will last. A lot of the time I’m dosing to get through the work day sometimes it doesn’t do much for me, sometimes I get irritable. I take it first thing in the morning and lay in bed or play video games until it kicks in , I take more while getting ready, more while driving to work. Another dose on break , a dose in between, a dose on my other break. At this point I’m not even keeping up. A lot of it is mental. 

For a long while I was in denial blaming my low productivity on other things. I got diagnosed with ADHD just this year. I told my doctor about my kratom usage and of course the amount I was taking was alarming to her. She prescribed me medication and put me on a taper plan. I told myself this medication would fix my problems. The plan was for me to taper off of kratom ( she didn’t want me to have bad wd) as she increased the mgs of methylphenidate I was taking. This worked for a couple of days. I liked the idea that I would be taking one capsule of something instead of more than 20 capsules of kratom a day. My first few days on the medication I was feeling great but due to my lack of discipline I wanted to intensity the feeling so I started to take kratom along side it. Now I prefer kratom even over my medication. I skip my medication plenty of days with no problem or wd because I feel that my kratom usage has over powered it and maybe even made it less affective. Me and my partner do perks as a recreational activity on the weekends and even those have less of an affect on me and we only do it once every three months. I took an addy a few weeks ago for fun and felt close to nothing. I could be wrong but I think kratom messed up my tolerance with everything. On top of that I get back pain I think something is wrong with my back but I’ve been too lazy to make a doctors appointment. I convinced myself that I was only still taking kratom because of my back pain at work but then I purchased a back brace that took all the pain away and there I was still popping dose after dose of kratom.

Then I tried to blame my lifestyle on the fact that I didn’t have a great environment where I was living. I wasn’t able to have a clean space to think clearly, eat healthy, workout, cook, and enjoy life like I wanted. My parents both love me it just was time for me to move out.

Well three weeks ago I’ve moved out into my first apartment with my partner. The first few days was great. I was cleaning , cooking, looking forward to my new life because this is all I’ve ever wanted. After the first few days I’m back to my sad self. I’m only sad because I know I should be getting a lot of things done but all I do is wake up an hour before work, take kratom and methylphenidate. Play video games until it’s almost time to go to work so I have to rush and I’m almost late or late everyday ( my job has personal time that I can use when late so I don’t get in trouble. I’m also late every morning because I do nothing when I get home to prepare for the next morning. I get home, I have all these things I tell myself I’m going to do. I take more kratom alongside the 20+ pills I’ve already taken that day, sometimes even on the ride home. I sit down play video games and tell myself after the kratom kicks in I will do what I’m supposed to do. Then it gets late , I rush to do a little something I go to bed late. Wake up feeling like shit about myself and repeat. I have three days in a row off and I wake up take kratom, lay In bed for hours. I get up, play the game. I never want to go do anything. I don’t even remember how I was before kratom all I know is I cared more about life. I was cleaning more, I was working out more. Usually when I leave the house it’s because my partner encourages me to do simple things like grocery shop. I don’t enjoy life anymore. I’m not even excited about my apartment anymore. I don’t care about anything I used to care about. I convince myself I’m going to do everything later. I  guess I could call myself depressed. All these years I’ve been telling myself okay tomorrow is a new day I’m going to change but this is the biggest action I’ve ever taken towards really changing. I’ve been scared of how I’d feel without kratom and even if I feel fine physically, mentally I can’t stop thinking about taking it. I keep waiting on something to change but I’m getting real with myself. I’m the only reason things haven’t changed. No medication , new environment etc is going to fix the issue if I don’t put in the work.

I’m finally being honest with myself. I’ve been trying to blame everything but myself and addiction. I’m tired of living like this. Today I woke up at 12pm and now it is 4PM. That’s the longest I’ve been without kratom since I discovered it. I find myself less irritable but I kept yawning even though I just slept more than 8 hours. I could definitely sleep right now. I drank some coffee but I was still tired and I hate how it makes my stomach feel. So I convinced myself to do a little seven minute work out and it did make me feel a little more alive. I haven’t worked out in years. Now I’m laying on the couch and drinking water. I don’t feel too bad , just abnormal . Keep in mind my diet isn’t the best. I have a lot of vitamins and supplements and I’m planning on taking one after I figure out what works for me because I need to get through this. I don’t work the next few days and I have so many things I’ve been putting off that need to be done. I did take my ADHD pill but like I said I think I ruined the effects of it with kratom . I want my life back. I think I’m going to take a cold shower because I feel gross and I’ve read it helps , on kratom even things like showering or throwing something away have become hard to do if I have no where to go I rarely shower. I do feel less irritable but my body just feels … weird. Every time I stand up at first I get dizzy. I’m definitely expecting this to get worse but I want to do whatever I can to get through it. Keep in mind I don’t have the best eating schedule as well. I am pretty skinny and I skip meals. I don’t have an eating disorder but I get stuck in a kratom daze gaming and procrastinate eating even when hungry I procrastinate EVERYTHING at this point. Lately I’ve been eating more because with me moving out food that I want is more available to me. This past week I’ve been eating at least 3+ meals a day which is progress for me but not necessarily anything healthy. 

Today I’m taking my life back and I’m hoping to join this community. As I’ve seen that there are other people who have felt like I do. I’m not blaming kratom. My partner takes it as well but he is not addicted. He goes days without it , he wakes up and feels fine. He still enjoys doing things in life. I’ve introduced it to a friend and she was able to keep her dosage to two capsules and skip days and she felt fine. I want to enjoy my life again I don’t expect this to be easy but I’m finally willing.

The only reason I’ve decided not to taper is because I don’t have enough self discipline so I’ve decided the only way I can quit is cold turkey.",14,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47937942}"

First time poster long time lurker.

I've had an on and off again relationship with kratom for about 6 or 7 years. Most recently around 40-50g per day for just over 2 years. 

I've been tapering down as much as I can, and I took Thursday and Friday off of work. 

My plan was to go CT but I've taken about 2g every 24hrs over the last 3 days because the withdrawals were unbearable. I have all the supplements and have been taking them as well, but I think since I've quit about 3 times before (and was an opiate/h addict before that) that I've broken my brain and my withdrawals are just horrific in comparison to others. 

I guess my plan is to go as long as possible without then if needed dose 1-2g to function. Anyone have experience with this kind of a fast taper instead of full CT? Will it make it easier over the course of a week or am I prolonging the inevitable misery? I'm not taking enough to feel good by any means, just enough to not feel like I'm dying.

I've been through this way too many times and I know I can do it, but I feel like I've fucked up my last 2 days off of work and have to work on Monday, so I'm not sure if I'll be in full accutes if it's a straight 48-72 hours without.

2021-07-17 10:45:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/om5lqc/day_20_ct/,Day 20 CT,"Quitters,

Thank you so much for all of your motivation. I am Day 20 CT today and check this thread every day to keep the momentum. I wanted to share my experience on this quit. I posted back in February on Day 14 about a ""successful"" slow taper. I fell right back into the sludge gradually and even during my last quit, I was still drinking, using coke, adderall and Modafinil to substitute.

Even though I was ""kratom"" free, I would count down the days until I could go out drinking and partying. I would wake up extremely hungover and take an adderall xr (20-30mg) to get through the next day. I was just getting through days, counting down weeks and substituting worse substances for k. I woke up extremely hungover/still drunk one morning and had a work obligation I felt that I could not face. I angrily drove to the smoke shop, bought an OPMS shot and caved after a month off k.

I justified this with ""getting through the work day"". I slowly dipped my toes back in and would take an OPMS shot before a night out saying ""this is better than drinking too much"" or ""better this than adderall"". Soon my excuses for k became more and more trivial-long road trip, important phone call, sore after a lift, etc. I was trying to avoid daily use, but began the balancing act of one day kratom, next day adderall, next day drinking and coke, next day kratom, etc. Long story short, I just couldn't be sober.

Pretty soon, I quickly eased my way back into daily use. I would take k in smaller, more controlled doses but was soon back in the 10-15 gpd range taking usually 3 3-5g doses/day. Like many members, I kept delaying my quit date. I began taking adderall daily too and the stack of addy and kratom was perfect for me in my eyes. Addy offered the motivation and lift and kratom took the edge off the anxiety. I began drinking every night to take the edge off both and go to sleep. This became an impossible balancing act and I finally had enough. I decided to check into an Intensive Outpatient Program three weeks ago.

The physical withdrawals were not that bad this time around (Day 1-4) with mainly GI issues and restless leg + night sweats. Mentally was difficult and early on, I kept looking for substitutes; kava/kanna, but as time passed, I realized that a substitute would get me right back to where I was. As my brain cleared and body recovered the cravings got weaker and weaker. Sure I would crave it, but the best advice for me has been to play the tape out. Realize that ""one more dose"" will not get you anywhere. My creativity has come pouring back drug free after 20 days sober. Around Day 16, I felt ""free"" of drugs. I had just finished exercising and thought ""I do not want to change the way I feel right now."" Obviously, I thought about them, but realized that k did not get me anywhere I couldn't go without out it. It had numbed me to the rest of the world and genuine connection.

Stay strong wherever you are in your quit. Realize that life with kratom is not really life. It was extremely destructive to my body and dulled my mind way more than I realized. It made me coast through life and ignore old interests and passions.",24,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49944922}"

I leaped.  I can sleep for 4 hours now and all other symptoms are gone.  In the past, on lower amounts, the withdrawal was so much worse.

The only thing different is I am in better shape than the previous quits.  I’ve lost 20 pounds since April.  I always work out, but I started to eat healthier too.  

It’s hard to feel like shit after running 3-6 miles.  Long-distance running also helps you learn to deal with pain.  When I run long races 26 miles + I have moments where I feel terrible, but then waves of positive emotions.  It never stays bad forever.

PAWS may hit me in a few weeks, but if I wake up feeling like shit, I’m still going to go on my run.  I’ve been a runner for years and when I was taking Kratom my 5K time went from 19 mins to 26 mins.  I’m ready to get my speed back and based on how I feel, my body is so happy I’m not on this green sludge anymore.

The natural high from running or working out is better than anything Kratom ever gave me.

If you are struggling.  I beg you to go for a run.   If you can’t go for a run, walk. I promise you, it will feel better than laying home suffering, and feeling bad for yourself.


I understand I’m very lucky that I did not get hit super hard.  Maybe for some thinking of quitting or tapering it’s a good idea to start working out and making it a habit.  Exercise is no joke.  Good luck!",12,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.64690155}"

I’m on day three and I’m actually doing really well. Gabapentin for RLS, and a quarter dose of Xanax every 4-5 hours to keep the worst of the symptoms at bay.

Honestly though, the biggest help has been staying busy. We met Iditarod dogs and hiked to a glacier yesterday, today we went on a day cruise, and tomorrow we’re going fishing. Also, it’s been awesome to experience things sober again instead of through a sludgy green haze. 

I totally built up WD’s so much worse in my head than they actually were. If you think you’re ready to make the jump, get your comfort meds, schedule a whole bunch of stuff to keep you busy and make the jump!

The worst is definitely the nights. The sun sets around 11:00 pm and rises around 5. Sleeping without K is hard enough but adding Alaska summer nights into it is so much worse. Again, not unbearable, and not as bad as I thought I would be but still miserable enough that I’m never going back.

So getting ready to kick Kratom again. Gonna take my last dose today and hopefully get through the worst over the weekend to be able to function somewhat for work on Monday. I’m an iron worker, so have an extremely physically demanding job and we’re way too busy to take time off 😐
  
A brief history… I’ve struggled with Oxy and Suboxone addiction in the past. Couple years ago I went through the Sub withdrawal which was brutal. That’s when I found Kratom, and ended up addicted to that with a 30+GPD habit. 
  
  Tried stopping multiple times but the anxiety was unbearable. I ultimately ended up grabbing an 8mg sub, taking 1mg a day for 8 days. It drew the WD out a little longer but seemed less intense. Long story short, I got through it. That was over 2 years ago.
  
I dabbled here and there since, but never for long enough periods to build a tolerance and go through WDs. 
  
Well, a couple months ago I went through an extremely painful breakup. After a couple weeks, I couldn’t bare with the hurt anymore so grabbed a bottle of K capsules, which led to grabbing a kilo, and so forth… 
  
  7 weeks later I’m up at 30-40GPD again. At the point where I start having withdrawals every few hours so dosing basically all day. But now all the reasons I was taking it for not only aren’t feeling better anymore, but amplified. I can’t do anything anymore. I work, and lay in bed.
  
  It’s time to kick it. But I don’t have the option of a sub this time. Just gotta go CT. I’m dreading the anxiety. I’m already in a terrible place mentally. But Kratom is only making it worse 😔
  
  Igot some 5htp, kava, ashwaganda, vitamins… Can’t even smoke herb cause every time I smoke in that past month I get terrible panic attacks. I know I’ll wake up in the middle of the night tonight in agony. I hoping that maybe since it’s only been about a couple of months, that maybe it won’t be too intense or last too long. But with my history, pretty sure my brain is already wired for it 😔
  
  Idk. Any suggestions, advice, motivation is appreciated. I don’t really wanna go through this all alone, because I am. And I’m just scared of the mental hell that’s to come when I’ve already been dangling on the edge for a while now 😔",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8270463}"

It feels amazing being a quitter in this context. I have been rummaging the board, over the last month since I started on my quick tapper. It feels really nurturing hearing everyone's story. I have been on my personal journey of healing for the last month. It's been a rough ride, but this board has helped out so much. Today I am on day 3 of my 3.98 gram dose split between two sessions. And also day 28 of my tapper. 2 weeks to the finish line for me.  

I bought some dlpa to make the jump easier when I get there, but I am worried about high blood pressure. One thing I noticed during my wd is that I get spikes of blood pressure, and I hear that dlpa increases this. Did anyone have issues with DLPA and high blood pressure? Just a side note I am on Cipralex for depression which is an SSRI inhibitor. 

On a side note, I am getting brain zaps in the morning before I dose. I have a lot of experience with this from my antidepressant when I miss a dose. So if you get this don't freak out, it's quite normal.

I just wanted to share my experience with likeminded people, for those who might care. And also because writing things out makes me feel better.

I've been a 5 x 10g a day user for over 2 years. First thing in the  morning was Kratom, last thing at night was Kratom. The only real negative impact on my life was the absolute abysmal sex drive (aka none whatsoever). I thought I could live like this forever, but I started to realize that there are other less direct negative effects of being addicted. You can't go traveling overseas without the hassle of either bringing enough Kratom for the trip (which could be illegal depending on the country you visit), or trying to buy some upon arrival which is such a waste of time. You can't go to your parents place without prepping your caps beforehand, or capping it at their place and making a huge mess because I'm clumsy and Kratom powder stains.

Anyway, what I'm getting at is I decided to go cold turkey. I'm on beginning of day 6. Maybe 50 gpd is not much for some of you, but I feel awful. I wake up every night at 2:45am precisely and can't sleep after that. Walking is a massive chore. I have whole body shivers every few minutes. Mentally, things go in waves. I'm sometimes ok, sometimes crying in my bed for no reason. From what I've read, things should start getting better by day 6, but they don't so far. I'm a little scared, but I'm hanging in there because I said loud and clear FUCK KRATOM FOREVER. One day this will all be behind me, and I will enjoy sex again.

Anyway, that's my story, thanks for reading if you did, I just needed to write a little bit. And good luck to everyone else in my situation right now. Stay strong, even if it hurts, it is possible to keep the right attitude. <3",38,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5184127}"

Vitamin C yo!  I just can’t sleep more than 2- hours a night.  I also had a little RLS and cramping last night.  It was strange because the RLS did not come until like 5 am.

I have a 20-hour flight in 5 days.  I was so scared to make the jump.  From what I gather I should start to feel better every day from here, but it’s possible one day I will feel crummy.


No anxiety or stress.  My levels are way better than when I was taking it.  No cravings at all.  F this green sludge. It’s like I was physically addicted and not mentally.

Now luckily I had time off work.  That helps with CT and I also think stress and anxiety levels. 

One reason I kept taken Kratom is I was so scared I won’t be productive.  I work a ton and I am a content creator.  I was scared I would lose all the hard work I made.  I kept convincing myself Kratom was making me a better worker.  Maybe, in the beginning, it helped, but it made me lazier over time.


What has helped me is running first thing in the morning.  I also wrote myself a goal schedule.  Don’t try to overdo it.  I gave myself one goal to accomplish a day.  So far I keep doing my daily goal and it feels good to check it off.

That has helped me so much to stay positive.  Not going to cave in now or give up.  I’m on mile 20 of my marathon.  Only 6 miles to go.  On the other side of this is freedom from this green sludge.

I decided to post here and seek some advice after having searched the net for hours... 
First of all, I'd like to say that today it has been 19 days since I quit kratom (15g/day, CT). I have to say, I am feeling rather well. Feeling like myself more and more each day that passes. It hasn't been an easy journey but I'm truly proud of how far I've come.

Anyway so, here's the thing: Over the past couple years, I have been struggling with some issues - other than addiction - which there is no need to elaborate upon imo. At this point, my psychiatrist thought it was best for me to start taking meds; more specifically, I got prescribed a low dose of SSRIs (lexapro, 5mg) and antipsychotics (risperidone, 0.25mg). I have never been prescribed any such meds in the past. The sole purpose of this would be to reduce overall anxiety so that therapy (CBT/DBT) could be more effective.

I guess what I am worried about is whether these meds could somehow interact with the ongoing kratom withdrawals I have been experiencing (both mental and physical). As in, could it possibly make the withdrawals ""return"" somehow? Or prolong them? I doubt that could be possible but I wanted to ask either way, just to make sure. 

It is my second day of taking the meds as directed, and I am feeling fine for now. Bit more tired than usual but that's about it. Plus the kratom should be out of my system by now, right? Since it's been more than 2 weeks.

PS: I am not using anything else. I don't drink either. 

That's all I wanted to ask. Any useful insights would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, all! :)",1,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46890116}"

I have ADHD and recurrent depression. My love affair began back around 02/2020; I was in a court-ordered drug program, my ADHD meds weren't quite cutting it and I was failing to get work done in university. The options were to increase my med dosage and get more work done, at the cost of side effects and turning into a robot with dry mouth and headaches, and adding in cannabis to help prevent side effects, yet sending me to jail, OR keeping dosage lower and synergize with a drug I'd tried a few times called kratom.

&#x200B;

Well, fast forward two months and I was having a little too much fun, binging on my meds while using the kratom to take the edge off, redosing kratom 2-3x per day or more if I'm pulling an all-nighter to finish a programming/elec. eng assignment. It was a lot of fun, at first. Minimal hangover, more sociable and extroverted than ever, no side effects from my ritalin, etc. (which is easy when you're system is constantly pumped full with kratom).

&#x200B;

Fast forward about 4 months into the summer from T- 0:00 and now I'm dosing 25 g/ day just to get a little buzz for a couple hrs where I can actually summon what little motivation I have, and then accepting the comedown/wds fro the next 1-2 hours, where I would then repeat the vicious cycle. This goes on for another 9 months until I finally decided to take a step back and realize that my lacking productivity at my new engineering job, and lack of happiness in life despite finally finishing my 4 yr degree after 6 years, is all a result of kratom. At this point I'm dosing 4 grams every 3 hrs, for a 1 hr boost of motivation and 2 hrs of comedown. I decided to finally take the plunge and begin tapering.

&#x200B;

I switch to a more potent blend (green indo) from my supplier (2 store vape shop chain in southeast), where I only need 2.5g per dose for the same effect as a 4g dose of my previous blend (red borneo). After getting down to 2.1g, each .1g drop per week sucks just as much as the last, getting slightly worse each time. So I start supplementing with phenibut, which makes me forget all about the kratom side effects, and the combo is so effective (on cloud 9, so to speak) , I almost forget about the taper, for which I'm down to about 1.6g. Only problem is fast forward 4 weeks of using Phenibut and I'm back in the same boat of just maintaining my phen dose to feel normal (BAD IDEA AND SHOULD HAVE NEVER STARTED THE PHEN). Start dropping .05g every week and it STILL SUCKS, but is very slightly aided by the phen and my properly adjusted adderall RX. Finally get down to 1.4g/day but really lingering and jumping between 1.45 and 1.35 doses throughout the day.

Finally, in a quickly summarized fashion, the court-order pre-trial diversion that I thought was completed bites me in the ass and during a traffic stop for bad tags I get arrested on 7/5 for a failure to appear at a court date that was supposed to rehash my failed pre-trial diversion (lack of communication issue, 75% my fault). Spent a fairly shitty (but not TERRIBLE, at least w/ regard to w/d) 3 days sweating/freezing it out in a holding cell (inadvertent solitary confinement: just me, a toilet, sink, bed, and interior window), with alternating spells of sleepiness and staunch alertness from the combined 4 month phen habit and 1.4 year kratom addiction. But around day 5 in jail while im in gen pop, I started to realize how I'm finally starting to feel normal again. By day 7, my happy emotions are in full spring with little anxiety and, combined with the purpose of fighting my way out of jail, I finally feel normal again. Fast foward to now (7/15) , the warrant is dropped (still have to sort everything out), I'm a free man again (literally and physically from the kratom), and I finally feel normal.

&#x200B;

I'm now clean from phenibut and Kratom after a long 3.5 month battle that I think could have even been shortened by 2 months. I know that my ADHD meds were a definite help in the taper but the kratom-free detox was completed without any supplementation, just a little instant coffee. My biggest fear from jumping to 0g was the acute depression/anxiety following the initial drop, but after 5-7 days that was gone. I know I have PAWS to look out for, so I will try to update you guys with my journey, in the coming months.

&#x200B;

# tl;dr: 1 year kratom addiction-> 3 month (4.5/10 feeling shitty) kratom taper with useless Phenibut supplementation turned addiction-> 3 day 0g kratom/0g phenibut detox (5.5/10 feeling shitty)  -> 10 days kratom free (1.5/10 feeling shitty)!!!! I guess the moral of my story is if your tapering routine isn't working for you, I recommend you stick it out and get as low as you can until you get the opportunity to take a long weekend off of work/school, and just jump off of it even if you don't feel comfortable about it (this is relative of course, do so with caution).

I hope you're all staying strong in your journey and finding moments of joy during this incredibly difficult process. I want you all to know that you have provided me with great insights in my short time reading this sub. I only stumbled upon this sub a few days ago after having a bit of a revelation at the beginning of the week. I have been using kratom for about a year and a half. I started daily use approximately a year ago and was up to 15-20g per day. 

As I'm sure many of you know firsthand, kratom makes bowel movements quite the endeavor. I woke up last Sunday and decided I was sick of the constipation and decided to take a break. By early Sunday evening, I noticed that I was feeling off: anxious, a bit sweaty, a nagging feeling that something was missing and amiss. That's when it hit me... I was chemically dependent on this shit. It had never once occurred to me that kratom had become an addiction. After all, it's an herb with a very mild effect, and it had curbed my desire to drink. I suppose the woo woo marketing makes it particularly insidious in that regard. I'm on day 5, and things are getting better.  (Monday and Tuesday really sucked.) I'm dedicated to sticking this out because quitting won't get any easier when I'm 2 years into an addiction.

The reason for this post is out of curiosity. I was just wondering how many of you accidentally stumbled onto the fact that you were addicted, as described in my poo story above. Or, did you become consciously aware of your addiction via self-reflection?

I had some health issues and extreme dp/dr as well as some panic attacks related to that dp/dr. Some of these things had been lingering for years but suddenly just hit me full force. 

All of this made me rethink my usage of kratom, which led to me realizing I was just abusing it and even if the abuse didn’t cause these issues I’d like a fresh start instead of hiding behind this powder.

So I started tapering, with the help of agmatine I was able to drop down to around 80 gpd with no withdrawals, which I feel extremely fortunate for as this initial drop gave me a little confident boost that told me “okay, this was possible”.

Over the next couple months I dropped down to about 40 gpd, had a couple hiccups as shit got busy at work and wound up back around 60 gpd.

But I got a little extra motivation about a month ago as I realized I wasn’t logging my use or if I was it was just my morning dose.

So I’d decided to start dropping a little at a time, maybe just wait an extra hour or so between doses, until I couldn’t buy anything more than a couple 40 gram containers instead of the usual kilogram bag.

I figured “fuck it, let’s see how long I can make this last” and wound up just about finishing the first tub last night.

Since Monday I dropped from 18gpd->12->10 and today should end with just 9 grams.

 
The rapid taper definitely has kicked my ass a little so far but I don’t feel like I’m gonna shit out a soldering iron anymore, anxiety is killing me most of all but no panic attacks which I am extremely grateful for.


Feel like the weight of today hasn’t fully hit me yet but I know this is a big milestone for me, feel like I’m actually taking some accountability and I’m really hoping to just not have to worry about dosing anymore.

I’ve still been lifting weights 4-5 times a week and have put on 15lbs already in the 4 weeks post quit. I’m looking much better physically now. I lost a lot of weight from using kratom and other opiates but it’s all coming back now ! The paws from getting off harder opiates (fent/H kicked 6 weeks ago) as well as the kratom is most likely lingering a little bit but it’s not holding me back from living my life anymore. I think I actually made it this time. I have no desire of moving backwards and am willing to keep battling if some rough days come.

I went on vacation and told me, fuck it I am taking a tolerance break and after 3 days I've got my first panic attack. extreme, like unbelievably extreme anxiety, horrible depression, my shoulder twitched all the time, extremely depersonalized and dissociated, extreme paranoia and delusional thinking, and at day 7 (the day where I got in psychiatry for 4 days), literally psychosis and hallucinations (I saw a women with a dress in my hallway and the face of my mum moved and she looked like slender man or something) we sat outside and It was dark outside so this doesn't made It any better. because I also didn't know what was going, I never once thought it was because of kratom and especially phenibut. my mum and my sister told me all the time that it was because of these substances. then I saw them hidden in a basket and I got extremely aggressive and took them and said if I couldn't take them now I will kill myself. (im an very happy person normally) because I live in Austria nobody knows these substances so they didn't believe me when I screamed that I need to taper. I can't this describe how horrible this evening was. really, I never even nearly had anything similar to this.

Now it is around 24 days later and im much much better. im extremely emotional now and I lost confidence that I normally (even without phen and kratom) I would have. I have no desire to party and right now should be the best time of my life (summer after ending school) this also stresses me out. I know the crying is healing and I feel 1000000x better after it but I wanted to ask if this extremely melancholy feeling will pass.

Mainly, I felt my liver was swollen and I was having pains in that area. I felt that slight swollen sensation for a couple of weeks before but it was never as bad as the few days before I quit, and I always attributed it to kratom . Not sure why I didn't go to the hospital sooner. I went to the ER and some of my enzymes were ABSURDLY high, they told me it was probably attributed to Kratom and I should stop before I do some serious damage and my liver fails out on me. I'm 26 years old dude, I should not have been having liver issues! 

I tried to do a taper for a day but the pains were only getting worse, so I decided to say screw it and go CT entirely. Called out of work for two days, had a day off after that, and had to return to work starting day 4. It's definitely been a LONG LONG week of no(or 3 hrs) sleep every single day, work wasn't fun those first few days, and I'm still having restlessness issues(hard to stay still or focused on anything). Plus mild RLS, especially at night, but I can say now that on day 9 I'm through the thick of everything! A couple days after I quit I noticed the swelling feeling going away and it hasn't been back since. This was DEFINITELY a kratom issue. 

In a way, I'm happy that I had to have such a serious issue happen to me to give me the final push to quit. But I'm only happy because my issue went away haha. A good side thing to this, is that because the experience was so terrifying to me there's no way in hell I'm ever going back. I'm not risking my life like that dude. Just wanted to give an update here, because Kratom definitely does cause liver issues in some people, as I'm sure a wide array of other health effects, and the faster you guys get off the better off your body will be for it!

I am on day 23 of my taper. Started at 30-40+GPD (probably closer to 50+GPD) and today will be a new step down, 2G x 5 doses spread throughout the day, down to 10GPD from 11.25. May sound easy, but it's not. I've been sleeping a little better, but the issue now is my stomach. I won't go into the gory details, but you get the picture.. basically living in the bathroom.

Taking super hot baths every evening to ease my aching joints and muscles. Just kinda 'getting through' each day. I wish I could take a week off work and just kick, but I have a LOT of responsibility at work and just can't do it.

So far this has been the easiest quit of my life.  I'm not going to say I feel fantastic.  It just feels so good to final make a decision and stick to it.  Quitting has taken me out of my Covid funk.  It's like my body did not want it anymore. 

My anxiety levels are the best they have been in years. I have not had one craving and have not gotten depressed.  I have no idea why.  I think it's mostly mental.  I run almost every day and eat pretty healthily.  I think diet and exercise play a big role in WDs and recovery.

If you are lurking or tapering, I recommend starting regular exercise and eating healthier.  I think it helps the brain heal faster.  I know Paws might hit me, but here is the thing.  When you exercise regularly and have a habit.  You work out when you feel good and when you feel like shit.  You just do it no matter what.  I always feel better on shitty days after a work out.  You can’t feel the good without the bad.  You are so much stronger then you even know.  No matter how bad the acutes or paws gets, you will survive and push through.

I would say recently I have been taking about 12 - 15 grams per day. It varied a lot, as I didn't have a strict routine, but 12 grams per day would definitely be a minimum dose.

I started to taper off fairly mildly by just starting to get used to 10 or 12 grams. I take kratom in 0.5g capsules so I have just been counting them and making sure I stick to around 20 - 22 capsules per day, with the intention of reducing this number every few days.

I figured this would be a pretty low impact on my body but I'm really struggling with this adrenaline withdrawal symptom. I read the subreddit FAQ and the closest approximation I could find was the Restless Leg Syndrome, but I wasn't sure if I was interpreting it correctly. I don't so much find I need to move my legs, as I need to move my whole body every few seconds. It feels as though adrenaline and ""butterflies"" flood my whole stomach and I feel like I need to tense my entire body to make it go away.

So far the only thing that makes this symptom stop is obviously just ...take more kratom. I've been really struggling to stay below my maximum capsule goal on a daily basis as a result because this symptom just feels unbearable, especially at night when it almost completely prevents me from sleeping.

Am I doing something wrong? Do I just need to grit my teeth and power through it? Any feedback or experience from someone who's gone through something similar would be hugely appreciated.

I got up to 80-100 gpd at my worst, currently at 35-50 gpd for the last month or so.

My questions: has anyone used suboxone to get off kratom, and how was that experience? I have used subs to get off harder opiates in the past, (heroin & oxy's) and it worked great and I was able to eventually taper of the subs and basically avoided any withdrawals at all.

Main question; does anybody know if you have to wait a day or 2 from your last dose of kratom to taking your first dose of suboxone? With opiates like heroin or oxy, you have to wait at least 16-24 hours after last use before taking the subs to avoid precipitated withdrawal. With kratom not really being a true opiate, but the mu receptors being triggered similarly, I have no idea if precipitated withdrawal should even be concerned regarding switching from Kratom to suboxone.

I quit the first time in January 2020. First 8-10 days were rough, no doubt. Did it CT that time. Made it 30 days and then relapsed. Was frustrating because I wasn’t having cravings, I just totally let my guard down thinking I could have some ‘once’ to celebrate something - 17 months later, here I am.

Within a month or two I got up to 15-20 GPD along with periodic OPMS shots. Continued that way until early this year. Before today I used every day (every few hours aside from sleeping) since February 5, 2020. Literally no more than three hours without a dose, usually 2-2.5 hours.

Got to a point 4-5 months ago where I knew I would have to get this under control. 
Decided I would taper this time. First thing I did was get rid of powder and go to capsules. I knew I had to be consistent with dose volume as I stepped down so that my body knew what to expect. Way too difficult to do that with powder - fooling myself to act like I have that kind of self control. Started off at 12 GPD, then 9, 6, 4, 3. At 9 and 6 GPD I parked for 45 days+/-. Once body adjusted I stepped down again. The good thing about this, at least from my experience, was that the first day or two of stepping down I could notice it, but it really wasn’t a big deal at all. After that I just made sure I was adjusted and stepped down. Parked at 9 and 6 GPD because of life/work circumstances that required me being “on”. My work requires public speaking and being in court as an expert witness and I just didn’t want to risk being a mess under those stressful situations. My point, YOU CAN DO THIS W/O HAVING TO TAKE OFF WORK OR BEING “OFF” WHEN WORKING. I stepped down from 6 to 3 GPD pretty easily over the past week and decided when I got up this morning I’d go ahead and jump.

Went to get supplements before work this morning, not sure if that’s the difference but I have almost no withdrawal symptoms yet. I I’m only at 22 hours so I’m not naive about symptoms still setting in, but last time I had symptoms within a few hours and again, I hadn’t gone more than 3 waking hours since January 2020. 

If the symptoms come, I’ll weather them. Even last time, it ended well before I relapsed. It’s NOT forever. Take your life back. I already feel so much more self respect for simply not taking that shit today. You have no idea how much it robs you of confidence and self respect when you’re knee-deep in the addiction and knowing you need to quit.

Update: I started that naltrexone last night and it was nothing like anyone was saying but the gabapentin helped a lot with my clonzapam because I went through the withdrawals but they relaxed my body but I still a bit of restless leg syndrome. I was only taking 6-12 gpd and went down to 6 and then didn’t dose for 2 days. I took the  25 mgs of nalproxene last night at 10 and had diarrhea when I woke up which lets me know my body is flushing the toxins. I wouldn’t suggest other people to do this but everyone has horrible stories, but everyone also has different lives, different spiritual beliefs and is not built the same or taking the same amount of Kratom. If I’m being honest a lot of this has been spiritual for me because I prayed to not drink at all because my sausage me drunk and I was extremely embarrassed becI go overboard when I drink and when I told my doctor I didn’t want things to be that way the medicine he gave me also takes Kratom away from me which I’ve been struggling with off and on for 3 years.

I don't feel as good as I usually do from my first dose. Now I fear that I'm going to sike myself out on how difficult this is going to be. I may need to try a taper. My average dosing is 12.5g per day. Has anyone tried DLPA? Has it helped? Any advice? Now I'm scared to quit, as much as I want and know I need to. I'm stuck.

Most of the acute symptoms have run their course by this point. No more RLS, sweats, chills, yawning, etc. And my insomnia was resolved when my psychiatrist put me back on my antipsychotics. 

But the lethargy kicked in HARD yesterday and it’s like I’m walking through syrup all day long.  This is by far the worst side effect yet. I’ve been forcing myself to get up and go for 2 mile walks. I am a distance runner, so I went ahead and tried to run last night. I only made it .75 miles before I nearly fainted. I cried when I got home.

Today I went for another run, but lasted a full mile this time. 

THIS is how progress is made. By these itty bitty increments that feel like nothing, but gradually add up. I’m sure in a few weeks I’ll be back to jogging 9 miles on the weekends again. But for now I have to accept that my body is just not prepared for that kind of damage. 

Another problem is that I have lost my appetite. I tolerate food because I know I need it, but the process of doing so disgusts me. Back when I was on Kratom, my appetite was raging. Most people lose weight on K… I gained it. Hoping this resolves soon because I’m not taking in nearly enough nutrients. 

I still can’t believe I’ve made it 7 days. It didn’t feel possible at all for the last several months. I didn’t just THINK I couldn’t do it… I KNEW. 

But one day something in my head just snapped and I couldn’t take it anymore. 

The only thing I’m worried about currently is when PAWS will hit. Is the fact that I’m lethargic mean it’s already begun? Or is 7 days too soon for that?

It was hard to figure out exactly how long I'd really been taking this garbage because I never saw it as a drug or something that could do harm to me. I keep thinking I'm 'in the worst of it' and then things take a new and interesting turn.

   Finally got my hands on a Trazodone prescription to combat insomnia, but today my body is in an impressive amount of pain. Nearly constant urinary irritation (burning, feeling like I need to go frequently) but it comes and goes throughout the day. Pain in my lower back which I am assuming is actually my kidneys screaming at me for being an asshole. Not to mention a previously severe anxiety problem that has just been amplified and evolved into a fantastic beast that I am currently trying to understand and put to rest.

   At the risk of sounding too negative, I wanted to publicly say how grateful I am to be going through this. That might sound ridiculous, but I'll explain. If there were no withdrawals, I would go back to this damaging drug just as quickly as I left it. These things that are happening to me are the fruits of my (lack of) labor. It's a lesson. It's telling me that I am not invincible and I cannot pretend to be by using drugs. Eventually, my bad habits will catch up to me and my body will not care about my hopes and dreams. It will only be responding to the damage that I purposefully caused, and it's time I listen to the alarms and start taking my health seriously. 

   I also wanted to say thank you to everyone on this sub for being kind and supportive. I am very glad this place exists because otherwise, I'd think that I was actually dying and I'd currently be in a lot of medical debt. Stay cool and try to have fun, people.

Day 2.,"Hey everyone, so I've posted here quite a few times over the last two years. You've all managed to help me a lot with how I perceive Kratom and my addiction to it, and although I've failed a few times in quitting, I've also ""successfully"" quit for 6 months at one time, and know what it feels like to be at the other side. At my worst, I was taking 3 extract shots a day. Preceding that, It was a 1oz bag of powder that would last me half a week to a week. I think in total, I started about 3 years ago (maybe even less) at the age of 27-28. The extract shots were maybe for about a year, year and a half.

Anyway, I was already at the brink of quitting **when I realized my hair was falling out.** This scared the shit out of me. My hair has thinned tremendously, and honestly I didn't know because **I'm a 30 year old guy that had fairly long hair** and it was only until I got it cut and watched it grow back that I realized I could see through my hair and down to my scalp toward the back depending on how my hair is parted.

I'm currently on day 2, and I feel okay so far. Not much sleep last night, but I think that was unrelated. I am also on medication for ADHD-like symptoms that benefits my life greatly, and although it worsens the WD related anxiety that comes with quitting Kratom, I realized that my achilles heal that always makes me cave and relapse is the crippling depression that comes with it, not the physical effects so much. This counters that. Down the line, within two years, I hope to be off any and all medication and hoping to maybe enjoy a little weed every so often or a couple drinks now and then. That can wait for now. I need to get this devil off my back first by any means necessary.

I have read several threads on hair loss related to Kratom, and it seems that the consensus on this subreddit is that there is some correlation between Kratom and hair loss. I know that asking you guys whether or not my hair will grow back is kind of useless being as no one knows me, my family history, etc, **but I was hoping those with kratom related hairloss could share their success stories where it grew back.**

Briefly, I had a full head of thick hair and in a way still do. I am very lucky - the thinning I am experiencing right now is nowhere as bad as other cases I've seen reported here, and I've also read threads where those that had straight up bald patches had their hair grow back after quitting. My grandfather on my mom's side of the family had a full head of hair up until he passed away, and I'm not sure if it's a myth that that side of the gene pool determines (in many cases) my own personal balding situation, but I'm really hoping that's the case because I feel like I would not be experiencing this if it wasn't for Kratom.

So, I'm ready for this. I'm actually excited in a way? I'm excited to embrace the suck, I'm excited to feel like shit....I'm excited to **feel** and be who I know I can be.

Once again, the **primary** thing that has me really scared, anxious, and sad is my **thinning hair related to Kratom.** If ANYONE reading this thread **could please share their kratom hairloss stories in the comments, especially success stories where it grew back, you would be helping me mentally in ways you can't even imagine.**

I ordered some black seed oil which will get here on Thursday (I heard that can somehow help with withdrawals?)

This is my 2nd CT quit after being clean for about 6 months, so I have a fairly vivid reference this time around of what to expect these first 4-5 days. In at least comparing these first 2 days, during the days, the headaches / brainfog have been surprisingly bearable compared to previous. That being said, the lack of sleep due to RLS is just as intense, leading to only about 2 hours of sleep each of the first two nights. For reference, this 2nd time around I was taking about 10-12GPD for the past 3 months whereas previously I was closer to 24GPD for about 1 year, so I'm hopeful this time around the physical symptoms will be a little more tolerable along with the confidence in knowing I've gone through this all before and came out on the other side.

I haven’t played video games as much since I’ve quit, cant really find any joy in them anymore (only day 14 CT). I view everyday clean as “leveling up”. Lol. Dumb, but I try to find anything that works.
I viewed the first week as hardish/entry level. You don’t really know the game yet, how you’ll feel, etc. So you kinda pick up the “game” and as the days progress and you get past the first week, that’s like a gold medal.
Now after week one, I knew somewhat of how the “game” was played, but was still facing obstacles and challenges. Still, nonetheless, kept going. If your character “dies” or fails the “battle” (I.e. I guess you could say relapsing) do you quit the game? No. You pick it up and try the level again.


Exercise metaphor/analogy:
Now it’s been 2 weeks, still playing the “game” and the challenges are different. I don’t know if they’re harder, but the mental battle is brutal. But anytime I think of relapsing I think of when I was training in running last month. I would run a few miles, give up, and think of cheating to get the time I wanted (this was a grade for a class). I would sit in a car and feel like a failure for giving up (I guess that would be an analogy for a relapse). One night I drove home crying feeling like a failure and my dad spotted me trying to drive my car slowly around the neighborhood to get the time (we used an app to track the times we got) I wanted to get an A. He said who cares you failed, get up and get back out there. That’s quitter talk. I was already burnt out by running 5 miles (I attempted the run twice already) and I was like “how am I going to run another 3 miles after just running 5?”. But something in me said no, you go back to that track and you run. Even if it’s slow, and you’re not happy with your time. So I went back to the track, and pushed myself to complete the run. Each lap I consider a day. There’s easy laps, harder laps (I was doing interval running where I had to run some laps faster than others), and easy laps. Recovery isn’t linear. Regardless, I amazed myself by completing it with a PR (personal record). That’s a day I’ll never forget and showed how strong I really am. I don’t know if any of you competitively run, but it’s certainly a mental battle. Your body and brain are tired and you’re like just give up, stop running but I kept saying over and over “mind over matter”.

These analogies won’t help everyone, but this is just my experience and how I’ve been coping. Music is also great too. To say I feel good at almost day 15 would be a lie, but there are moments where I do feel good and content (usually when I’m out of the house and in the real world). Im still emotionally numb, cravings are really kicking in, but that’s ok and I need to accept it.
Anyway, to anyone who has relapsed you are still strong regardless. Any attempt to continue anything that’s extremely difficult is strength. Remember that. Don’t beat yourself up. Get back to the track and finish that run. I hope this benefits at least someone. Anyways love to you all and happy healing ❤️.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5855136}"

I started taking kratom 8 years ago because going through med school with young kids was very stressful for me. Within a couple of months I was using it several times a day. I noticed pretty early it was addictive and I tried stopping many times without success, until I finally made it in 2019. Withdrawal was so painful I promised myself I’d never use kratom again. I didn’t take any for maybe 6 months. 

Then the pandemic hit. Dozens of patients in my care died within weeks. We had shortages of everything. The patients’ families were angry and devastated. We were mostly powerless to help. Lots of the staff got sick or just left. The kids were at home 24/7 for months. It was by far the worst time of my life and I’m still having nightmares about it. 

Long story short, I couldn’t handle the stress and ordered kratom again. And now I’m back at square one and completely disgusted with myself. I feel like I’m a terrible parent and person. I hate my lack of self control. 

I just started tapering again today and I’m planning to quit within a month. I’d prefer doing it faster but I can’t take time off work and I need to be in decent shape to handle workdays.

I have quit alcohol and benzo's in the past but kratom seems to be a different beast. I mostly take it during the day to get through work, trying to avoid dosing at night as it only exacerbates the issue. My substance use in the past was mostly centered around after work activity as its fairly hard to do my job while drunk or on benzos. Kratom on the other hand makes the day go by easier. I work customer service on the phone and based on my personality type, I find this pretty stressful at times. If I am honest with myself, the stress of my current job only adds to the stress of quitting kratom and makes the mental gymnastics a lot easier. I have started looking for other jobs as life style changes will be needed for me to succeed in this. 

Over the weekend, I tried to aggresivly taper and detox some of the alkaloids out of my system. I did take some percocet to aid in the WD's, I am aware this is not the best choice for a speedy recovery but having to function at work, I caved and chose the easier route. On 7/10, I only took 5 g. 7/11, I took a total of 11 g. Yesterday, even when returning to work, I managed to keep it to 8 g. However, during these days I was also taking 5 mg of percocet to aid in the WD. Well today, the percs are all gone, it is 7 am and I have already taken 15 g. A definite step backwards but I am trying to remain positive and keep moving forward and without the percocet. I was able to get a good nights sleep last night which I feel good about but getting through the days is my struggle now. I know I can beat the sludge, it is just frustrating at times but again, I am doing my best to keep positive. I appreciate this group and the support I see being given to one another.

Having used Kratom to manage trauma and depression, what sort of WD symptoms should I expect?","For some background: I was an opioid addict for roughly 10 years before Kratom, most of that on suboxone maintenance after a 1 year fling initially with heroin and oxy. I basically used suboxone to numb my trauma and depression. It worked okay for awhile but eventually I realized there was a lot of life I was missing out on in zombie mode. Started to taper off that, opened up spiritually through various means (definitely had some psychedelic assistance there), got involved politically, met a girl, and decided I wanted to get off the subs. So I went to kratom as an ""intermediary step.""   


That was probably 8 months ago or so now? Crazy to think it's been that long. In any case, I started around 15g/day. I've been doing a very slow taper since, with some ups and downs corresponding to different stressors in my life. I've also been doing a lot of pretty deep healing work and spiritual development to try and address the root cause of my addictions and different neuroses. Wim Hof method, IFS therapy, some psychedelics, books (really like Gabor Mate), yoga, meditation, journaling, exercise, online classes on trauma healing, support groups: the whole gamut.   


I'm finally nearing that point where I'm ready to jump off for good. Been at .75 once a day for about a week and feeling relatively stable there. I actually went two days since my last dose, and thought about keeping it going, but I started having some really difficult stuff come up for me tonight, and my girlfriend and I are leaving on a 2-day disneyland trip tomorrow, and I figured now might not be the best time for me to have a bunch of intense stuff come up. So I did end up taking another .75 tonight, with the hope that I can get back to jumping off entirely after our trip.  


I know .75 once a day is a really low dose compared to some on here, but it's the last substance that I use daily, having already quit nicotine and cannabis. I know a lot of people here have had experiences with various mental health issues and I suppose what I'm most curious about are what I can expect in terms of emotional difficulty, trauma resurfacing, etc. Thanks for reading :)",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5521083}"

&#x200B;

Last week. I decided I had enough (after many years) and decided to take control of my life.

&#x200B;

I had a daily use schedule that sounds different than most on here. I could never take more that 2g at a time without feeling the wobbles and nausea. So I took lots of little doses through the day, 1 - 1.5g, but like every hour sometimes pushing it to two hours between doses.

&#x200B;

So my first task was to figure out how much I actually took in a day, then to get on better schedule. I wanted to reduce the number of times I took it in a day, which seemed like it would make the taper schedule easier.

&#x200B;

Turns out I was taking around 20-25 gpd. So I tried to spread that into 2g doses, less frequently. Shit, my body rebelled against that, even. Since that alone had induced mild WD throughout the day, I decided to knock the total amount down at the same time, might as well I thought.

&#x200B;

So one week later, I'm at 16gpd. Split between 2g does from waking up to going to bet. Just now starting to feel adjusted, so I'm thinking of starting to drop again. I've got some time, so I'd like to take  a moderate pace.

&#x200B;

Should I reduce every dose evenly, or every other dose kind of thing? 

&#x200B;

Also, any advice on working meals into a taper schedule? I would always try not to does at least an hour before eating, otherwise the K would have super strength and I'd get the wobbles. But I've also found that taking K right after eating is basically like not taking it at all.

2021-07-12 17:36:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/oj128a/adventures_in_quitting_kratom/,Adventures in Quitting Kratom,"I am now over a week free from the grasp of kratom and the brain of an addict.

It has not been the easiest week, that's for sure, but certainly it is one of the most significant. It has been the week in which I reclaimed partial control of my live and how I live it.

I used (loving the past tense here) kratom daily for 15 months. I never measured weight, but at the peak I was taking 2-3 teaspoons 4-5 times daily. By the end, I was taking 1/2 teaspoon 2-3 times daily.

I was introduced to kratom by my brother while attending graduate school. I took it for a few days, noticed extreme restless arms when sleeping, and gave the bag back to my brother. I recognized the beginnings of addiction, then stopped.

Until I didn't. Suffering through an extreme flare-up of an autoimmune disorder in the peak insanity of COVID, I turned back to kratom as a way to dull the pain. And dull the pain it did. I wasn't nearly as miserable, and the initial euphoric rush made me feel like my lot in life wasn't so bad.

Until the rush wore off. In the summer of 2020 I firmly noticed the withdrawals. Eight hours in, I'd get restless, feel an odd cold feeling from the back of my throat down through my esophagus, and I craved the warmth kratom provided. So I'd re-dose and eight hours later, repeat.

On Christmas Eve 2020 my mother who has been sick with a similar autoimmune disease was hospitalized (again). She had deteriorated as a person in part because of her condition, as well as her dependence on drugs to combat pain and depression. My mom was not my mom for years, and I am still grappling with how it affected me. Due to COVID, I could not see her, and I felt a certain numbness to it. I knew kratom played a large part. Four days after her 69th birthday in February, I watched her take her last breaths. I felt the WDs set in. I tried my best to stay strong, but in the immediate moments after the wake, I lost it. Some things, some feelings--suppressed or brand new--are so strong, even the haze of kratom cannot numb them.

I felt lost and hopeless. I feared turning into my mother, becoming dependent on things to mask the pain of an unlucky dice roll in terms of health. I knew I wanted to quit, I knew the suppression of my emotions was not sustainable. The conscience is a powerful thing. It has a way of telling you that you KNOW change is necessary, that you're not fulfilling your true purpose, that, in a way, you are asleep in life's waiting room.

Still, the addict brain churned. I will quit in the summer when it is hot. I will quit after my job obligations. I'll quit when I have some time off. I'll quit when my other health symptoms are in check. But for now, I feel this tinge of sadness and restlessness. Sorry, conscience. It is time to dose once more, not for the uphoria, but just to reach some semblance of tolerable baseline.

Until late June. At the doctor. I tell her my situation. I talk it out and hear the addicts words slip from my mouth. We both look at each other and know something else is talking for me. She takes her secret calendar, gives it to her secretary and says to her ""Find time in August."" She turns to me and says ""Next time I see you, you'll be off this stuff.""

Accountability helps. Guilt can even help. So on Independence Day, I decided I would no longer be dependent. My taper (starting from the realization of my addiction in summer 2020) was purposeful but with no real end-goal. It did, however, lessen the WDs and acutes.

I didn't sleep at all that first night, but I accepted what was to come. I knew I wouldn't get off scot-free, but prayed that I might.

On July 5th, on 45 minutes of sleep, I walked around my neighborhood and felt the wind. You know, really felt it. I turned on some music and heard it. Really heard it. I opened my laptop for work and really felt the urgency of the situation (I am a co-founder of a start-up). Life was beginning to feel ""real"" again. I was leaving that metaphorical waiting room and returning back to clean and honest living, accepting of all emotions, good or bad...feeling them all, thoroughly, as they were meant to be felt.

One night my restless arms were driving me crazy. I looked to my bookshelf and saw between two stacks an Icy Hot sleeve specifically meant for joints (the hotbed of my restlessness) that my mom had given me one night, in the midst of her haziness. Funny how a mother can know these things without really knowing.

It's been a week. I've shown myself to be beyond the influence of melatonin, but other things (THC, CBD) have helped me get the sleep I require. It's still difficult at night, in fact, last night, I stood in my home's doorway as it rained, contemplating going out to the trash to scrape some kratom from the bottom of a bag I'd dumped and flushed, just for some minimal respite from insomnia.

But no. I played back those hazy memories, the days bleeding into other days, the sense of complacency battling with my conscience and some higher power, and walked back to my bedroom. This battle will not be interspersed with defeats. I will not cave again.

My days shift toward some higher calling, beyond some idle narcissim. What can I do to be better? To be the best I can be? So I can fall in love and start a family and provide without that sense of guilt. 

The road is unclear, but the light of the moon shines through the dark, and a path is unveiled. It was always there, but I see more clearly now. I feel more authentically now, too.

For those struggling, know that I understand. Your acknowledgment of a problem should not be without celebration. You know what to do, now act. For you, for your family, for your friends, for that conscience, that inner-voice that knows you should be wanting more from life than a cheap hit of temporary comfort.

Your body, that beautiful and perfect machine, it will recover. It will be confused at first, but in your DNA the struggles of all those before you vibrate, and from this the power and will to continue forward will win out, if you let it.

The past is fixed, but the future is infinite. Let that true inner-voice guide you in the now, and that peaceful, productive future you desire will be manifest.

To feel is to be human. To live is to transcend the desire to simply exist.

We're stronger than we know.

I've always been a healthy shooter, but over time, my volume went way down and one day instead of producing the normal pearly-white substance it came out the worst greenish-grey color. I was shocked and horrified, and thought the worse. This happened 4 times over about a week and a half. I was terrified to have sex with my partner as I didn't want her to see it and worry.

I was very stoked to see this community existed about 8 months ago. At that point, I decided it was time I start stopping kratom. Like so many people, I bought into the hype about kratom being 100% safe and non-addictive & didn't think twice for about 5 years. In fact, it wasn't until I found this subreddit that I fully accepted that this is a thing & there are at least tens of thousands of people addicted to kratom and struggling with it.

Anyway, so I decided to do a slow, gradual taper based on the guide in this subreddit. I had meant it to last about 4 months but it's been 8 months now, and I've decided now it's time to really quit. I'm one week into a 5-week final taper, and then I'll be quitting cold.

When I started kratom, I lived in a state where it was... readily accessible. About a year and a half ago, I moved to one where it isn't. Luckily, it's about a 2 hour drive for me to be able to buy more, so I have that on my side. For most of my kratom career, I did about 10 g/day. However, a year and a half ago I was diagnosed with cancer, and a complication from my treatment about 6 months later caused me to have unbearable pain for a week, and in that short time my usage tripled. So, for about 6 months it was around 30 grams/day. I thought that was a lot, but reading other people's stories, I realize it could've and would've gotten a lot worse if I hadn't started to taper when I did. I've successfully tapered down by about 80% and am now at the dose I was about a year into using kratom. So about 5 years ago.

Absolutely cannot believe I made it this far. Being bipolar hasn’t made this journey any easier, and I’ve wound up in the ER twice during this nightmare. 

Both times in the hospital were because of lack of sleep. Bipolar peeps NEED their sleep and if they don’t get it, it induces mania. So I had no choice as I was beginning to see and hear things that weren’t there due to insomnia. The first doc was a moron, but the second one got me on some good antipsychotics, and for the first time in 5 days.. I slept last night. 

I’ve tried numerous quits before, Some
Being easy, the last one being impossible. I had relapsed by day 6.

Due to the lack of sleep, I was so delirious this time around that I haven’t gotten up out of bed at all, except to pee shower and eat. Yesterday I wanted something out of the top shelf of my closet. My hands outstretched towards it… and then… this is the last thing I remember. The next thing I know my sister is slapping me awake and telling me I passed out. Scary shit, but that’s how tired I truly was.

Now that I’ve had a night of sleep, I decided to go outside and go for a walk. I am a distance runner. I recently completed a half marathon, but the sidewalk didn’t fucking care one bit. I was gasping for air and falling all over the place like a drunk. I made it one block and collapsed back in my bed.

I will say that I’ve had lots of help during this quit and it has made all the difference. I finally told my mom about my addiction and she calls every night. I have lots of clonidine and some klonopin. And I use various supplements mentioned on this page. My sister brings me food and water if I can’t get downstairs to get it myself.

But most of all, I’m lucky for YOUR stories and all the people who’ve battled this alongside me. And for those who reassured on my first day, when I was absolutely hopeless and broken.

I know everyone says this, but this time will stick. I have zero cravings, attend 2 group therapy groups, go to private therapy and I just can’t fathom ever going through this again. Even with helper meds… the pain was brutal.

I was at 4+g 4x daily before I got a scale for most of those years. I’ve been weighing for about 4 years now and reducing. I was at 2.8 a dose for about 2 years and started reducing in May. Over the past couple of years I’ve felt like shit when I dropped, but never attributed it to the reduction. I was down to 2.5 g in June and doing great. I recently decided to decrease every week by .1 g each dose, leaving my evening dose with the previous weeks dose so my sleep isn’t disrupted. Over the past two weeks of going from 2.5 to 2.3, I was a f’n wreck! The symptoms were nothing like a missed dose I’ve had previously (anxiety, RLS, gut punch, etc.). This was severe fatigue with unbelievable muscle weakness and muscle fatigue.  Walking to the bathroom exhausted me and I became breathless. I started to think it was my hormones crashing on me or my anemia creeping up, but increasing my meds did NOTHING! I was completely debilitated and I’m a single mom to a child with multiple disabilities that works FT, so this is not something I can be! I have no support so taking time off from parenting to CT is not an option. After trying everything under the sun to feel better and not getting off of the couch for 4 days, I decided to test a theory and upped my AM dose back to 2.5 g today and within an hour the fatigue started to dissipate. This leads me to believe my feeling like crap is in fact the drop. How much slower can I f’n go though?! All I can do is taper in a way that’s not super disruptive, but if reducing by .1 a week causes me to not function, what other option is there? I want off of this so bad but I have to be functional doing it! My thought is that I need more than a week for my body to acclimate? Has anyone else ever had these wonky symptoms though from such a small drop; just fatigue, breathlessness, and muscle weakness? Kicks in about 36 hours after the drop.

I have some extremely deep-seated trauma that I'm trying hard to work through with a therapist. There are a lot of days where I just feel like crying. I've had near daily anxiety attacks since I quit, and I'll be seeing my doctor to hopefully get a recommendation for a psychiatrist soon.

But I finally have the motivation to do the hard work of taking care of the things that made me an addict in the first place. Every time I took kratom to ignore my problems, I missed an opportunity to listen to the way my entire body and mind were screaming at me that something needs to change. Before kratom it was weed. Before weed it was Adderall. Before Adderall it was alcohol. Nearly 5 years I've ignored the signs.

There is also beauty. I believe my biggest gift in life is one of passion. That passion has been coming back. I want it to stay. I don't want to think about how many beautiful moments I missed because I was suppressing my emotions.

I was up to at least/around 30gpd and was feeling so sick from my use. The worst part was crippling dehydration - like a bad hangover every day, sometimes all day.

I started tapering and joined this sub about 6 weeks ago. I got down to 7.5 gpd 

Then the addicted me started to panic. I started to put a lot of thought into how I could still pull some pleasure out of the amount I was taking. Then I started backsliding and within a few days I was back up to 12-15gpd. So on Friday night I took my last dose, thanked kratom for all that it's shown me, and dumped what I had left in the trash. 

WD hasn't been too bad. Aches and lead legs and tired. First night was toss and turn hell, yesterday my torso was so bloated I felt deformed. And omg did I stink!! But it was all manageable. I just kept telling myself this is temporary and it all means my body is healing. I don't get RLS but at night I get this bizarre tightness in my low back and my ankles (Kratom Back!!) that makes me extraordinarily restless. At some point in the wee hours last night, that lifted away, though. And I got several hours of sleep!! I was not expecting that to happen so soon!! 

Yesterday I noticed I took more deep breaths than I had in a year. When I feel triggered now, I take a deep breath. I feel triggered A LOT. If kratom was still in my cupboard, I would not have made it through yesterday. A week ago I would have seen that, for me, as ""weak."" Now I just see it as the way it is. 

I was really stuck on thinking if I couldn't get to the end of a taper, I wouldn't have the discipline I need to quit and stay quit. So I'm proud of myself for changing course when I needed to.

This sub has been amazing and inspiring. I've learned so much and changed some of my opinions and tried new things because of what people share here. 

So it looks like my pink cloud may arrive earlier than expected. Pretty soon there will be no acutes to manage and react to, no euphoria of ""YES! I did it!!"" to ride, and it'll just be me facing this life with no substance crutch.

So I take about a big spoon full three times a day and I just quit cold turkey and am struggling. I'm past the 32 hour mark. My situation is a little special because I have schizo affective disorder and I started in the first place because I had to wait a couple months after scheduling an appointment for psychiatric treatment. I had to deal with a landslide of psychotic symptoms while juggling work and it was the hardest thing I ever had to do. Kratom provided me a slight relief and somehow I managed to not blow my brains out during those couple of months. I should have stopped as soon as I got proper treatment for my condition but I didn't.

Now I feel like it served it's purpose and all the relief it provided me has come crashing down all at once. I feel like I was on a relatively small dose compared to others as well but I'm still struggling. 

The first symptom I feel is nausea and that's the main reason I've kept up the addiction up for too long. If I go hungry for even an hour or two then my anti psychotic don't work. So for that reason my doctor prescribed me zofran (generic) to fight off the nausea. It's actually working really well. But now I've encountered so other issues. 

Throughout work today I experienced pain, headache and what I'm pretty sure was dysphoria. I got through work and when I got home those things got worse. And then I tried to go to sleep... I already struggle with insomnia so I take trazodone but even taking over my prescribed dose won't put me to sleep. And I normally only need half of the dose to knock me out.

So now it's six am where at the time that I'm typing this and luckily my next shift is an overnight so I have all of today to try and at least get a nap in. So I decided to embrace the super insomnia/restless BODY syndrome by browsing reddit, YouTube and drinking some alcohol.

Quick snapshot of my relationship with kratom.

- I took it intermittently in the beginning of 2021, and by that I mean once or twice a week.
-in the beginning I couldn’t handle those extract pills (they would make me puke) so I’d take half of one
-fast forward a couple months and I’m starting to take kratom more and more throughout the week.
-for the past month or so I’ve been taking it everyday, maybe a couple day break here and there.
-At one point I even tried to use phenibut to come off kratom, which was great for helping with cravings but then I started taking kratom with the phenibut to feel even better. Pretty soon I realized I had been taking 2-3 grams of phenibut every day for over a week, so I quit that, and kept taking kratom.

I keep making these posts saying I’m gonna quit, but then I end up doing it again. I guess it’s better than just saying “fuck it” and continuing to use kratom with no intention of stopping.

I only dose once per day. Usually after work I’ll take an extract pill (which is like 4-6 grams of powdered leaf) or on my days off I’ll take it before I lift.

Now I really need to figure out how to stop taking this shit. It’s not a brutal addiction like painkillers, it’s just sneaky and annoying. Like today I hadn’t taken kratom at all, said fuck it, and drove to the smoke shop cuz I was “feeling restless.” I don’t notice any severe withdrawal symptoms, other than intense cravings and maybe some restlessness.

I’m about a month and a half in to daily kratom use. I dose once per day, and it’s one of the OPMS extract capsules each time. Do I taper (using powder) doing like a gram a day or just keep trying to stay completely off it? I just don’t want to set myself up for failure, would a taper help keep some of these cravings at bay?",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46211654}"

I guess it’s different for everyone but I assumed my decrease in libido was due to depression and not the K or maybe the low dose of Prozac I’m on (although I have been on Prozac for almost a decade and def had a libido prior to using Kratom) so I assume it’s the Kratom that caused the loss in libido because I’m on a way lower dosage of Prozac (10 mg every other day, used to be on 80 mg and had a libido back then).

I've been using kratom for over 3 years taking \~3 grams 3x a day. My self control to never exceed 5 grams really shined lol (although with red vein I'd sometimes take 6 grams but that was rare). Anyhow, it honestly truly helped me, until it didn't. I should have respected the plant but instead I abused it. I really do believe it helped me stay off of heroin for good, it was the only thing that finally got me thru PAWS and truly changed my life. I just let it get out of hand but just like most of us I was pretty naïve.

I was so sick of being hooked on this drug, but was traumatized from the w/d's from heroin/xanax that I started tapering extremely slowly over a 3 month period and was finally down to taking 1 gram  3x a day wondering why I was still even using at that point, but kept tapering and now I'm at .2. It's wild, I never thought I'd still feel affects at that low of a dose but I do! I was taking that dose now only twice a day for a few days but the last couple days I've only dosed once a day. I'm jumping today, which I'm sure I'll be fine but I'll be sure to update you guys. Last dose was at 3pm yesterday.

It's insane to see so many people taking such high doses for so long... I can't even imagine. and to the people that are claiming withdrawals are worse than heroin... myyyyy god baby jesus that hurts my soul. I hope you guys were able to make it thru that and have finally come to see the light cause that is... dark.

I'm rooting for everyone! WE GOT THIS! it's time to be freed from the shackles!

Update:  I can't believe it's already been 20 days. Holy fuck. I feel like I've been reborn again. lol a little dramatic but it feels as if I've been cleansed.

Pooping every day again is definitely something I'm still getting used to lol.

RLS has eased a lot, still there though. Hoping I can get some proper sleep again, but even if I don't, I have the day off.

I´d just like to give you a short update on my tapering process.  
I started tapering at 25.12.2020 from about 35gpd and today was my 14th day on 0,5 gpd.  
It was probably the hardest thing I ever went through in my live so far even though it was an very slow taper. It feels like it was and is the fight of my life. Vitamin C, niacin, a multivitamin, hot showers, exercise and praying definitely helped a little. Slowly I start feeling better. I´m very effective et work, I make much better decitions, I´m able to sleep 8 hours a night and the RLS, the fatigue, the depression and the aggression are getting better every month. I plan to take 0,25gpd for another two weeks and then jump. Fortunately I have six weeks off work than.  
I´m convinced that your success-stories and your posts and comments were and are a major part of this jurney.

It's been a month and a half of tapering down from 16-24gpd to 5gpd.

I feel like I gotta jump now.... before this week I didn't have an issue with the extended taper and wd as long as I kept making progress. 

But this painful throat issue is not sustainable. I need to get completely out of wd now as soon as possible. 

Quickest way is to jump...

I haven't dosed yet today and am going to try and not to. However I need a good night's sleep as the throat kept walking me up this week. 

So... if I wake up with rls tonight,  I'll cut myself some slack and take 2g. Won't be a disappointment either as I haven't gone a full day without dosing since the holidays during my first quit.

I haven't had a full nights sleep in 3 weeks (since i quit), so it may be a mixture of my incredibly fragile mental state and literal non-stop paranoid anxiety that's come from that, but I am starting to freak myself out that I contracted something.

I am new to this subreddit and apologize in advance for this possibly confusing essay:

I am finally taking this step and I am quitting kratom. I used to take it only on the weekends but since January I was slipping into daily use after I quit taking Phenibut (which I took daily for 3 years). I was concerned about it being a daily habit and I always wanted to quit it but I had a lot going on with my studies which made me never take the jump. The reason why I am now quitting is a positive drug test by a psychiatrist, which put me on the spot: either I quit taking kratom or I will be cut off from all my medications. I am living in Sweden and they generally have a no-tolerance attitude to drug abuse. A doctor will not prescribe anything if they know that you are using. This would have been quite fatal for me since I am taking antidepressants and methylphenidate for my ADD. I  thus decided to taper off over 2 months and  I was on 3gpd when I got referred to a psychiatric department that manages addiction patients as well. A nurse there decided 2 days ago (Thursday) that I should quit CT  and then come in 4 days later (on a Monday) for a (hopefully-negative) drug test and meet with a doctor, who will (hopefully) put me on new medications to manage all my underlying mental health issues. I am hoping that I would get help with stronger ADD medicine and maybe some pills that help me with my withdrawals (I once was prescribed diazepam and it worked very well) until I am steady again. Getting back on my legs immediately is quite important to me since I am in the midst of writing a PhD application  (which requires me to write a 10 page doctor thesis proposal until September) and I can't focus at all (not with kratom before I quit and surely not now that I am going through withdrawals). 

Does anyone have experience with urine drug tests? I dove deep into the posts on this subreddit and found out that most still had a positive drug test after 9 days? I am quite sure that my test will still be positive after 4 days. What do you guys think? Anyone had negative urine tests after 4 days? Did anyone had experience with doctors who wouldn't prescribe you your ADD medications due to a positive test? Interested in hearing your stories (it helps me while I trying to kill time going through wd :))

I guess I’ve started my PAWS (day 10 CT here but tapered a bit prior for about a week) as I feel numb and just depressed. Had some mood swings of happiness a few days ago, but now, I am just numb.
Let me tell you what I am taking. I am on a low dose of Prozac, i am on diazepam, I take daily vitamins, and try to drink as much fluids and antioxidants as possible, as well as kava if needed.
I’m starting school up again soon and really worried I’ll fail. I’ve been on Kratom daily I would say for 3 and a half years to four. On average 8 GPD for four years I guess to estimate. Smoke shop capsules - god knows what amount is in it. Idk. Can’t believe I’ve been poisoning my body for this long thinking it would only help my mental health which initially it did - then turned me into a isolated non motivated person.
Anyways, I sound like a broken record with all my posts, but those of you who went through PAWS, what do you think the estimate is? I just want to feel happy without relying on something that in the end - only made my happiness go away (strange how this stuff can turn on you).
I have no intention of going back - not really cravings but I did have a dream last night (yes my dreams are back) about Kratom where I picked up a bag and in my dream I said “nah” and threw it in the trash. I guess you could call that a subconscious craving but regardless, I’m not going back (and at least my subconscious self in my dream said NO.)
At one week I felt no pain but my joint pain is back. Still sneezing. It’s annoying. I exercise as much as possible. At one week I did a great run as I felt no aches and felt normal. When I leave the house I feel normal and forget about it for the most part but it still lingers in the back of my mind.
I know I was taking a lower dosage than most people here - also was never addicted to opiates or anything like that. Took it for my mental health. What I’ve been diagnosed with is as follows (very long list): general anxiety disorder, panic disorder, clinical depression, treatment resistant depression, seasonal affective disorder, anorexia nervosa, bipolar disorder, etc. I mean the list is endless.
I just want to know if this is me and how I feel naturally or this is just PAWS. And I would like an estimate on how long this PAWS is going to last because I really want to crush it this school year as I’m graduating college this year in psychology.

Ah, going through this again. I quit kratom twice before - once after only six months of use, but I wasn't truly planning on living sober. I just needed to clean up for a while. I hadn't truly been planning to quit for good. And so less than two weeks later I started using again, daily. The following year was a pretty good year overall, with generally good things going on in my life, but I felt completely dependent on my 2-3 times/day dosing, completely dependent on kratom. I started using it because I thought I needed it; it gave me energy, and inner peace in social situations, which gave me confidence to walk right up to anyone and start a conversation . . . and these are things I've wanted, and not had, most of my life growing up and being an adult, as well. So it really was like a miracle drug for me, although I could tell it was pretty fucked that I absolutely could not stop, usually couldn't even skip a single day. But in the meantime, things were good. I didn't quite notice them subtly getting worse and worse . . . irritation and anger were popping up in me where they didn't belong.

I have an ""addictive personality,"" I suppose, which may be another way of saying I'm in danger of addiction. I turned down heroin as a teenager, when my friends started doing it, and who knows how fucked up my life would be if I had thought I could handle it. I could be dead or wishing I was . . . But anyway I didn't. Just smoked weed a lot, even when I thought I shouldn't. And I love coffee, and never skipped a single day of coffee drinking for seven years. Pathetic, but I just didn't have the mental willpower. 

I went through what seemed at the time (and probably was) the hardest thing I have ever done a couple of months ago - I stopped using kratom. I was a mess, I couldn't get much done, oh and it took me twelve grams to feel high, which was all I wanted from kratom - not to prevent withdrawals, but to feel the high. I managed to only dose twice a day (usually) during the end there, so about 25 gpd, sometimes 30 . . . kind of a lot. And I was doing worse in all ways all the time. My face seemed to be getting redder more often, like when I would dose, when I would come down, sometimes it seemed to be red all the time . . . I got a new nose freckle. My vanity was taking a hit, and kratom was making me uglier on the outside as well as the inside.

I wanted to post my story after I made it through, but I never got around to it, and here is the short version: A therapist and supportive family members were absolutely key to helping me start the withdrawal period. I only went through major withdrawals for about 4 days. The first two were nightmarish, achy, dread, tired and mad days, and I felt drawn to dose up every second of those days. (Somehow I didn't.) On the third day, I was sitting in my truck trying to muster up the strength to get up and go to work (usually, I would dose during this time) and I noticed something in my body - a physical sensation of dread, like a full body downer feeling, really, like a physical dread in my entire body - I'd been used to this feeling, not noticing it, and dosing enough kratom would temporarily make it go away - but this day, I felt the feeling, and I \*noticed it was less than the day before.\* And that felt huge, like clear evidence I was getting better, maybe even past the worst of it, though not all better. I took a hit of weed, got out of the car, and started doing my physical labor, and I smiled and laughed! Kinda still felt like crap, but I knew then that I was passing through the pain into the better side of life. And it wasn't hard after that. Every day, for weeks, I felt slightly better than the day before. ""I feel better every single day,"" I said to myself. ""I hope this lasts forever."" After two or three weeks it sort of leveled out to my disappointment, but at least I was doing pretty well and not dependent on poison!

But I, and my life, were never perfect. After a really lovely month (the pink cloud) I wanted to try using kratom responsibly. Sure, everyone says that's a bad idea, that it becomes an everyday addiction again, and that quitting gets harder and more painful each time. But if I only dose once one week, twice the next, none the next, I should be fine, right? Maybe. But I tried that, got mildly high off only 4 grams, and took none the next day, feeling fine. ""Wow, I got this. Kratom can help me and I won't mess up."" So I took some the next day, and everyday after that for a month, rocketing up to twelve grams THREE times a day. I could have stopped alright, but I basically liked it. Now I don't like it. My face is flushed, I can't work or interact with people without it, and I can't seem to skip my morning dose. Whoops.

Anyway, two nights ago I admitted my addiction to a new friend. I wasn't planning on it, but the topic of addiction came up, and I didn't want to lie. (I want to respect myself. I have told major lies before, but I don't want that to be me.) So I told the truth. And the next day (yesterday) I felt like I had a bad cold, flu, and a fever. (I didn't have a high temperature but my skin was hot and flushed.) I spent a lot of the day in bed although I did force myself to eat two meals and go for an evening walk.) Today, still felt pretty bad, but slightly improved already. I think I am incredibly lucky to have a fast metabolism and I can be over this soon. After doing a Wim Hot breathing, I just got up and poured my bags of kratom all over the ground and mixed it in with the dirt. If I had done that after quitting last time I wouldn't have casually relapsed. I know I can buy this poison anywhere, but I don't want it, so I threw it away. And it felt good!

P.S. Yesterday was pretty miserable and I had a headache all day. Headaches suck. Yesterday was the first time in seven years that I have gone a day without coffee!!! And today is the second. One bag of black tea yesterday, one bag of green tea today. No caffeine, no weed, no drugs of any kind, tomorrow. I haven't done that in years. Which I am not proud of, but I am proud to do it now. Wish me luck tomorrow. And God help me, I'll never do kratom again. I will, however, live a great life. Starting very soon.

I'm so terrified that I just found out I'm pregnant. I have a mirena IUD that is supposedly 99.9% effective to prevent pregnancy, but I guess i'm the .1%. I'm taking 20 grams three to four times daily, and I've been trying to quit for a while now but have lost motivation due to depression.

I know that kratom dependency during pregnancy can cause withdrawal symptoms for infants after they are born. I'm terrified to tell my doctor about this, because he could report it and social services could get involved. I know kratom is not illegal in my state, so I'm not sure if they could try to take my baby or not. I'm so scared that I won't be able to quit and that it will harm my child or possibly cause long-term health problems.

I have been doing research on kratom use during pregnancy, but there isn't a lot of information available. I feel conflicted about telling my doctor about the kratom use. If I don't tell him, I'm afraid the withdrawal symptoms could be life-threatening for my child in the first few days after birth. I know I need to find a way to quit before the child is born, but I've been trying to quit for a very long time and I always end up relapsing.

$146,000 in 5 years. That’s how much money I’ve spent on this crap. At least one positive I can take away from this is that if I apply the same level of motivation to saving that money as I do on this substance, the rewards will be substantial. 

I am extremely grateful for the wealth of information available in this group and am looking forward to joining the fight with you. 

The plan:

Due to my circumstances, my plan is to taper. How that taper is setup exactly will depend on what I find my baseline to be. 

Goal 1: My first goal will be to create a taper schedule and start date that is highly organized and specific. In my experience, motivation is temporary. Therefor discipline will be the backbone to this entire thing. As an extension to this goal, I will also create a list showing all of the ways this has negatively affected my life and how quitting will improve it. 

Goal 2: My second goal will be to update this post daily once I start. Sharing my progress, experiences and support will be extremely important. 

My next update will include my taper schedule and start date.

To be honest, I avoid it at times as it makes me anxious to think about what I might have to face but I am well aware of that without this sub. I have tried unsuccessfully to quit in the past. Start tapers strong but always end up going back. I am at the point where I am having health issues I can only assume are caused by kratom as I have had thorough GI testing done at this point and they are at a loss of the cause. Of course, I am less than truthful about my kratom intake so I haven't really given them the chance to identify the problem because in that case....I would have to quit. Not really gaining anything from it at this point though. No real effects other than being ""normal"" and not sick. Ironically it is making me sick from use (in addition to withdrawal) and I am ready to quit and get my health back on track before it causes my life to get completely de-railed. I mostly use kratom for work, I don't like my job all that much and it induces a great deal of anxiety so the cycle of use is extremely easy to get back into, especially working from home being able to freely take kratom out in the open without fear of others seeing. I need to make a change and I figured that officially joining this community might be a good addition to my plan and program for recovery from this crap. I have faith in myself as I have been able to get out of a pretty nasty benzo addiction a few years ago. I have been able to avoid alcohol for almost a year now by white knuckles and kratom. I know what I need to do and am lucky to have the resources available to me as I have had to use them before. By resources, I should clarify that I mean AA and NA and similar support groups. I am not too crazy for AA and have been around for my fair share at this point but it helps. It can be a place just to get out of your head and be around people that at least somewhat understand similar struggles. I did not use AA to quit alcohol but know that kicking kratom will be tougher and I will require more support as it has been a few years of daily use at this point. I just need to take the plunge. I am starting to taper today and plan on coming up with a solid plan over the weekend, mostly from digging into this sub. I just needed to get this off my chest and I am sure a lot of people here can relate. I don't really have many people in my day-to-day that get it. Thanks for letting me spout.

(A Long One...),"Coming off of a year long relapse after a 3 month first time quit of a  16 month 90+ gpd habit. In 2019, I had began working on my mind and willpower. I quit tobacco, stopped drinking so much, began exercising after a life of sedentary living, and went from 400 lbs to 270 today (240 at my lowest). Along the way, I discovered kratom. This shit was amazing the first few times I used it. I was able to focus, have energy, and push my mind and body in ways that I didn't think I'd ever be able to. I even ignorantly attributed a lot of my success to kratom. I started to realize a year in, though, that even though I was using WAY more than when I started, I was starting to lose what I thought was given to me by kratom. I couldn't focus on simple tasks without extreme willpower, I was eating garbage daily again, and the confidence and energy that I had early on in this addiction turned into fear, paranoia, waking up in the middle of the night with a stomachache every other day (easy for an addict to just blame it on the hot chips that you ate earlier 🤷🏿‍♂️), and mornings sitting in a bed waiting for a high that will never come--a high that you only get a handful of times in those 800+ doses that drag you through your year. When quarantine lockdowns spread to us, I had nothing but my yard, room, and hallways. I said ""fuck it"" and went all in dosing even more that I thought possible without vomiting all over the place (which I had done twice by this time....). One day, though, I said to myself, ""you know, you tell yourself that kratom does so much for you, but you literally spend days at a time pacing around the house rambling to yourself. You haven't done shit in 3 weeks. Why can't you do them anymore?"" It was like a light switch. I dumped everything. I suffered through the insomnia, the rls, the fatigue, and I was becoming ok. Cue disaster relationship with an old ex 3 months later, and I was back on my bullshit; screwing up at work, eating trash, not taking care of myself, and drinking sludge like a septic tank. Fast forward to a little over a month ago. Ex out of the picture, and I was just surviving. I wanted to quit, but relapsed in a single day. I get through June. I have this time off, and I did nothing that I said that I would do. I was in bed and going through the motions for a month. I am very in tune with my mortality (31, but still..) and the fact that time is valuable. It scared me more than anything had in a long time. The first few days of July were revelatory. I fought myself to accept that since I let kratom back in my life, things went down shit creek fast. I couldn't afford to blame anything else anymore--I'm all I got, and nobody cares about what I care about but me. And when you lose the ability to care to K, time just kind of--stands still.

Anyways, sorry for the journal entry. I don't talk to people about these things. It's been 7 days since my last dose and my 6th day CT. I've been staying sane by exercising everyday,  something that I had never pushed myself to do and feel great right now after what feels like a week-long flu. I told myself, ""you need to replace kratom--you do it when you have too much time doing nothing."" So I committed to exercise in the mornings because otherwise I wouldn't leave the bedroom. I'm not doing nearly as much as I was doing, but I find myself getting strength back everyday and it's like my brain forgets that I'm supposed to be withdrawing while I'm in the rhythm. On top of that, I've been spending my nights on my art (weaving) since I literally can't sleep more than 2 hours at a time (last night was a bit better, but I still woke up to rls after a few hours), and have made progress on my best piece yet. I've also been experimenting with my vitamin regimen and found that a cocktail of cdp-choline (350 mg TOPS for my body or I just get clearheaded and really depressed with a mild headache), DMAE, Omega-3/DHA, vitamin d3, Vitamin C (megadose about 3500 mg), Iron, super b-complex, and Magnesium (megadose@~1000 mg throughout the day) have kept me clear-headed and keep the fatigue/chills at bay.

This is my first post, and I need a little support and help with a relatively quick taper.

I'm almost three years into using Kratom, my peak was probably a year ago at maybe 30gpd and recently I've been at maybe 20gpd but I honestly don't know - I never really measured it out. I just took it whenever I felt like it, teaspoons in warm water, often five times a day. My total gpd may have been much higher than 30 actually...

Anyhow I started a taper on Tuesday, using an accurate micro scale for weighing doses. I chose to start at 12g \*total\* per day, divided into smaller doses as necessary. I want to get off in two weeks or less.

For me, I need a decent-sized dose at bed time or I can't sleep - I have RLS and a prescription for Gabapentin which works great for me, but I haven't gone a night without dosing Kratom at bedtime for a couple of years at least. I would prefer to suffer during the day and sleep well at night.

Tuesday was a bit rough, and yesterday was worse, but manageable. 12g is clearly quite a bit less than my usual daily amount. But I want to get off this junk ASAP.

So... should I try to stabilize at 12gpd and then drop to 10gpd or 8gpd or something? Or just keep reducing every day from now on?

I can deal with a bit of discomfort during the day, but I need to be able to sleep, and the last two nights I've been waking up twitchy and restless, needing to dose. Will taking bigger doses at night make it harder to taper? Should I measure it out evenly throughout the day?

I am committed to leaving Kratom behind. It has been a long relationship, and it honestly helped me get through a really rough time in my life a few years ago, but it's time to get clean.

Thanks for reading you guys, and thanks for being here and supporting people getting their lives back!

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm on day 4. I dropped from 12g to 11.5g the first two days, then did 9g yesterday fully expecting to need more all day long, but I never needed to. Today I'm at 4.5g so far and feeling no symptoms except really, really tired. I'll take that over the pain though. I'll take some more before bed tonight, maybe 2.5g and hope that's enough for a decent sleep. That will make it 7g total, which feels like good progress so far.

It seems like I can do a 1.5g dose and that's enough to keep cravings and WD at bay. Looks like a tiny amount and makes me realize how much I was probably taking each day before this taper.

Thanks for the comments and support guys!

Edit: Finished day 5 feeling a bit twitchy. Went to bed having met my goal of 7.5g but sleep was impossible. It was 110F here in CA and hard to sleep anyhow, but I also had intense RLS and general body agitations. Finally, at midnight, I got up and took another dose, pushing me back a day on my taper. Feel like I let myself down - I wasn't able to tolerate the WDs. Going to try to take \*MUCH\* less today. I am just so sick of this crap.

I've been lurking less and less as I get further away from my addiction, but I wanted to stop in and show my appreciation for helping me get this far.

It was all of your stories and support that motivated me to finally quit 8 months ago and I haven't relapsed since. 4.5 year daily habit of 12-20gpd. Tapered very slowly over  2 months and went CT from 750mg once/day.

It was actually easiest at first. The pink cloud was real for me. I was so proud of myself and felt so free. It was just so liberating to feel okay without kratom every day. That didn't last. The underlying depression and anxiety I had been self medicating for came in force and stayed. I wasn't tempted back to kratom as my physical state has improved so much and I knew it would have been worse.

It was a collection of factors that helped me through. Staying away from work that I needed kratom to do. Getting a cat. Focussing on mental health struggles. I've eventually ended up on 10mg escitalopram daily in addition to therapy. I've found the SSRI very helpful. I know they're not for everyone, but some of the lingering bad thoughts have been muted and I have negligible side effects.

Are you able to experience that euphoric sense of well being through things like meditation? Did any of you realize (or discover through therapy) that your “baseline” is actually clinical depression, and decide switch to medication? I feel like I’m at a crossroads, again—one that I’ve reached so many times. Empty sobriety and self discipline (which feels tenuous and hollow), clinical therapy and medication (which threatens another eventual dependency), or…take the gamble of self-medication/moderation. Did I ruin my brain’s ability to reach the natural highs through sobriety?
The longer version:
In the past, I tried being healthy, meditating, adopting a more spiritual mindset, which got me out of a pretty dark phase of social drinking. About a decade later, depression, anxiety, and social drinking (and whatever recreational activities came my way) made a bit of a come back—but this time I conquered it with therapy, and eventually, Wellbutrin, coupled with an amazing upheaval and seasonal relocation to another continent. After abandoning my meds and therapy (which really did help, along with “wintering” in Southeast Asia for 5 years), well… anxiety and social drinking came back. Chronic pain introduced me to Tramadol, which felt more like the greatest most energizing antidepressant ever, but I didn’t want a physical dependency, so I stopped that. Kratom seemed like a more innocuous, safer version, and that was my downfall, of course. 
Now I’m mostly sober (still have a few occasional glasses of wine or beer, and I make sure I don’t drink when I’m anxious), running daily, eating pretty well, but I have no hope, no goals, no sense of well being, no sense of gratitude for the people in my life… and it’s enough to make me want to self-medicate again, or clinically medicate, because, for the first time in almost decades, I really *felt* those things, but now they’re gone. Any feedback, even “hey just shut up and try meditating again, ya big lazy baby”, is extremely welcome!",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49195167}"

I'm about 75 days sober now and it indeed has been a journey. Lately, PAWS has been pestering me. Looking back, there is something strange I noticed, where I did not make the connection to Kratom use back then. 

I had been experiencing horrible nightmares for years before I quit. These included some forms of sleep paralysis like starting up from my sleep by hearing extremely loud and realistic screams. The dreams themselves included physical pain. This was especially torturing since I felt (or my brain believed to feel) it. They depicted scenarios of extreme melee combat, manslaughter and even abuse. Sorry, it is really strange to be open about something like this. 

What always puzzled me is that there was no trauma I knew of, which is usally responsible for such phenomena. And since I quit ... they are completely gone. It is thus very likely that they did indeed correlate with Kratom use. 

So, to make a long story short, is there anyone who made the same experiences? How could my use have been responsible for these nightmares? Could it have been some part of my mind already deciding against the substance before ""I"" realized it?

I got back from a trip two weeks ago, and immediately fell back into using. It’s crazy, I’ve already gotten my mind back into the habit that kratom is just a part of my daily schedule.
I don’t even feel the guilt or fear that I used to feel when I’d pull up to the headshop to get more. Instead I’ve just kind of accepted that “hey I’m using everyday again, better go get my K so *insert any task* doesn’t suck today”. That being said, I want to stop again. I don’t like the way it makes me feel, I hate the way it makes me look and I despise how spiritually draining it is. Whenever I get back into the swing of active addiction, I can’t seem to justify stopping.
I trick myself, so to speak, into using again. So, in summary- I found it so damn easy to get into the swing of Kratom addiction again in no time. I want to break this chain/cycle. What can I do tomorrow to make myself NOT go pickup when I normally do. I feel like quitting from this 2.5 week bender seems so much more daunting than the last time.

I've been off kratom since and couldn't be happier. I beg you, if you're struggling to quit please seek professional help. There is no shame, only dozens of other addicts and therapists who are dedicated to recovery and rebuilding lives. 

For some context: I quit my job at the start of 2021 to ""get my life together"". I learned very quickly I could not do it alone, and left to my own devices I would make my kratom habit much worse. At the start of June I set my ego aside and acknowledged I was failing miserably. I sought professional help in the form of outpatient rehab. I weaned down from about 15-20 gpd in three days and then started the program. My withdrawal was fairly minor (praise god). What I took away from the program is that most rehabs have experience with kratom addiction, take most insurances, and are THE place to go to address any addiction. Jobs consider rehab a health related absence and therefore cannot fire you (at least in Maryland). I've gone through several quit/relapse cycles in the past year and a half but today I can confidently say my entire mentality has shifted. There's a lot of ""wisdom"" on this sub that people can do this at home on your own. That's just not true for a lot of us. I could not do it alone and without a supportive community of addicts turned friends. Kratom started for all of us as a less serious drug but its addiction is no joke.

I also quit drinking since I was using it as a social crutch, vaping nicotine, and using adderall to work. 

I haven’t done any of these substances in a month and I’m proud of myself, but I still feel a bit empty inside for some reason. I’ve been pushing myself outside my comfort zone, and have been socializing more than ever, which I thought I could never do while totally sober. 

I’ve done so many amazing things this past month that I know I should feel proud of, yet deep down I still feel as if something is missing. I’m not sure if this is just the PAWS or what, but I guess I’m still trying to figure out how to live life without all these things. I find myself bored a lot, and when I try to focus on one thing I lose focus relatively quickly and begin doing something else. 

Sadly, my libido is nearly non-existent, and my cravings for sugar and junk food are through the roof. I’ve been maintaining very healthy habits and dieting, yet late at night I sometimes can’t help myself but to indulge in my cravings. I hope they go away soon.

Other than that, I’m proud of myself that I’ve finally broken free from my crutches and addictions that were improvising me, but I guess I expected life to magically get 1000x better after a month. Hopefully I start feeling happier and more joyful about my accomplishments soon, and to everyone out there who’s quitting, don’t give up.

Things have been different for the last 2 days though. I am suffering from the worst fatigue I ever experienced in my life. Just getting out of bed in the morning is a fight and I am having the worst dysphoria. Guess this is PAWS??

We want to begin trying to conceive our first child, which is our #1 reason for wanting to completely end our intake of kratom once and for all. 

On a regular day, I would take 1 leveled teaspoon about 3-4x while my husband took 1 heaping tablespoon around 5x daily. Kratom really took a toll on our bodies in different ways over the years without us even making the connection. He is doing a rapid taper while I’ve made the decision to go CT. Although he doesn’t blame me whatsoever, I carry quite the guilt in knowing that my husband would’ve never even heard of this stuff if it weren’t for me. 

Yesterday was the first time I’ve ever gone a single day without kratom in a little over half of decade. I took no medication/supplements to help myself get through the day and it felt unbearable. I slept a lot, but it wasn’t a very restful sleep. I was in such a foul mood (more so than usual) that I couldn’t even bear to be around myself. 

This morning, I made the dumb decision to have 1 small dose and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I felt infinitely better right after taking it…. and that lasted for about an hour before I started sobbing. l hated that I felt so much better after taking it. I hated feeling like I failed before I even properly started. I got through one whole day so why didn’t I keep at it, you know?

Then I realized that treating myself badly when I’m already feeling awful won’t help my psychological strength. My husband is a far more stoic, mentally well off human being than I am so he feels very confident in our ability to quit. Although it’s not really in my pessimistic nature, I am trying my hardest to keep it together for both of our sakes. I know we can do this as long as we set our minds and don’t give up on ourselves. I just can’t psyche myself out or beat myself up about things I cannot change from the past.

I’ve been in therapy (specifically DBT) since March of last year and while I’ve made great strides with my therapist, the one thing I’ve struggled with the most is my distress tolerance. This is mainly bc I’ve only made half-assed efforts to learn healthy coping mechanisms. I realize now that kratom was one of the crutches holding me back and I won’t let it negatively impact my life anymore. I don’t ever want us to feel so dependent on any substance again.

The only thing I want for us is to start building our own little family in the best and healthiest state of mind/body possible. Tomorrow, I start fresh with the help of all the heartfelt, inspirational stories shared on this subreddit. Thank you kindly to each and every one of you…

Life seemed to improve a lot finally. My mood is better, my brain feels almost back to normal and paws is almost gone. I was in disbelief of how long this recovery was taking. I almost lost my mind knowing how long its been and I still don't feel back to normal. Nothing ever took this long to recover from.  I don't know if it's a placebo effect . But something changed  majorly since starting vitamin C. It's the only supplement I take now besides a multivitamin . I'm only writing this post because of all the trial and error with everything else.  And after all the time and money spent on nonsense. This has helped me a lot imo.

I’m a very heavy user, I normally take atleast 100 grams of powder per day and some days more. I’ve recently started doing the concentrated kratom shots as well (opms liquid shots once every other day on top of the 100+ g of powder) 
I’ve being using this much on a daily basis for the past 3 years. At first I literally saw zero negatives or side effects to taking kratom, I have a very time demanding sales job and kratom has helped me a lot in staying focused and motivated to get more work done at work. But I’m at the point now where I literally can’t have enjoyment unless I’ve just dosed kratom. If I have to leave the house for more than an hour or two I have to make sure I bring kratom. It’s gotten to be pretty terrible. Every morning when I wake up I’m already withdrawing. 
So up until recently I’ve finally realized that I can’t and don’t want to live the rest of my life like this. 
So My plan is to start weening off of it for the first several weeks and get my daily dosage down to about 10-15 grams then go completely cold turkey. 
The past week I’ve cut my kratom intake by over 60% I’ve only been taking 35-40g per day (5 grams 7 times through out the day) 
It’s definitely been harder to get as much as I normally get done at work and I do have some mild withdrawal symptoms but nothing to bad. 

I actually did quit cold turkey about 6 months ago and was off completely for 12 days and the first 6 days the physical withdrawal symptoms were beyond hell. The last 6 days I was just extremely lethargic and unmotivated to do anything, even the most simplest of tasks seemed impossible 
So this time I can’t really afford to go through that because I have to function at a high level every day for work (I took off work when I tried quiting before)

Hoping someone can help,"So I have been addicted to opiates for about 9 years now with some clean time intermittently in there, never longer than 9 months tho, usually closer to 3–4 months before a several month relapse at a time. I was on suboxone for 2 years (occasionally switching back to heroin for a few months at a time then getting back on subs, but never clean off both) until December when I finally tapered off subs after a couple months back on H. I toughed it out after a 10 day taper and still feeling withdrawals and made it out but was introduced to kratom and got hooked. Now I take it 3-4 times a day and am stuck just as bad as when I was on the other two. I feel so shitty at all times as the K doesn’t even work anymore really and I get so sick so fast. I also have developed a small benzo habit that I’m kicking now (nothing major but enough to get some rebound anxiety). 

TL;DR: what’s my best route to get off kratom?  I’m finding tapering with it to be very difficult, more so than suboxone for some reason. Would doing a lower dose, short sub taper be better or worse?  How long are Kratom acute and post acute withdrawals usually?  What can I expect from CT?",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8170805}"

So, still going strong after about 1 month(?)..I don’t even remember, and to be honest, I’m happy to not be counting any more—*for now*. I’m just curious for those of you further along: how did you differentiate between that sort of WD-induced manic joy, and actual, natural euphoria? I feel like there’s this consolation prize during the acute phase: strong bouts of manic joy, joyful tears and chills while listening to music, extreme optimism, and energized thoughts. But if/when the PAWS roll in, it dies down for a while, and replaced by those anxious, less joyful times. It’s incredibly frustrating to decipher baseline feelings vs. the roller coaster of a recalibrating brain—but did you suddenly “know” when you reached “you”?

Day 23 - CT 100+gpd. Not going back and no PAWS ...yet (Hope to bypass them entirely).

What I did differently this time:

* Read these thread and the How-to's, guides and posts to mentally prepare myself. ⬅️Do this
* Started working out about a month prior, improved eating habits, and supplemented w/vitamins, proteins, electrolytes
* Took modafinil for the 1st week after going CT

The 1st 10 days were absolutely horrible - no sleep, anhedonia, no appetite. Pretty sure modafinil did not help matters. I was prepared for that, BUT I had zero cravings or desire to use. Day 11, I forced myself to the gym and selected at least 1 simple thing to complete; e.g. wash dishes. I read time and time again that two weeks is when things get better. True for me.

Day 12 and beyond have been good. Vision back to normal(ish), head cleared, motivation returned. I begin a new job tomorrow. This was one of my main reason for quitting - could not do this and work at the same time. Started reading again, today. Like that.

My workouts are getting better - Brutal gainz / insane pumpz, or whatever the dude-bros call it :). More weight, more reps, further, faster. I take a multi like every other 2 or 3 days. Same with protein. Not eating like a dumpster and exercise are key to recovery imo, Someone mentioned adding the sauna - Good call there. Thank you!

After I hit ""Post"", I'll hit the gym for cardio, then the sauna for meditation and stretching.

Game over, I win - kratom is a mf and God has once again delivered me from the ravages of addiction. Not going back; I've to much potential to piss it away. Grateful 🙏🏻

What's next. Nothing - No xanex, no kava, no thc, no booze, no tabacco, no vaping. There is no next high / relief.

Hold what you got, Airborne. Ruck up, move out and draw fire.

I’m a veryyyy longtime lurker, but this is my first post. I have been on and off kratom for about nine years, but a relatively heavy user for the past five or so. About two year ago I noticed serious side effects that I had, for a long time, escaped — complete absence of libido, inability to find enjoyment of anything outside of kratom, and rapid hair loss (yikes).

In past quits I’ve either gone CT or done a 10-day rapid taper, but in the end, PAWS has always gotten the better of me. This time around I decided to do a proper taper, coming down from about 50 GPD over the course of several months. I had been keeping a spreadsheet and documenting my daily emotional/sleep patterns and the use of any helper meds (propranolol, phenibut, magnesium, etc), until a few days ago where I had gotten to a more reasonable 15 GPD.

**Enter the mistake** (or was it?):

On Friday, I realized I had run out of my antidepressant, Zoloft. Due to some bureaucratic nonsense with the pharmacy, I wasn’t able to refill that day and instead decided to scrounge old toiletry bags, backpacks and drawers. Lo and behold I managed to find a single pill deep in the bedside table and took it without a second thought. About an hour later, while eating lunch, I started experiencing WILD temperature fluctuations. I was simultaneously burning hot and freezing cold. I began to shiver, and several minutes later crawled to the bathroom where I experienced some absolutely nightmarish diarrhea. I had been eating some spicy food, so my initial thought was that this was the result of some sneaky hot pepper floating in my soup. It wasn’t until the akathisia hit me a few minutes later that I started to put things together. I’ve had restless legs before, but goddamn this was a whole other level of misery.

Anyway, it turns out that my girlfriend had an old old script for naltrexone, and for whatever reason there was a loose 25mg pill which very very closely resembled Zoloft in the drawer. Fortunately I’ve read quite a bit on naltrexone and its mechanism of action so I was able to piece things together and avoid a trip to the emergency room.

48 hours later, I feel a WHOLE lot better. I have zero cravings for kratom, which I count as a blessing, but am conflicted about whether to desist tapering and try cold turkey again, or perhaps more wisely, to hop back on my taper plan and count this as a valuable learning experience.

My concern, as always, is PAWS. The physical symptoms of withdrawal have always been manageable for me. What scares me is the day, two months on, when an ever-present cloud of anhedonia, depression and anxiety trick your brain into thinking that THIS is what sober life is really like. I’ve learned through enough trial and error that it can take a long, long time for the brain to reset its neurotransmitters and the specter of sadness and apathy linger way longer than you’d think. Still, in the moment, even if one knows deep down that the feelings aren’t a reflection of reality, it becomes awfully easy to convince yourself to reach for some green sludge.

I think, for the moment, my strategy will be to tough it out, at least for a week. I’m going to experiment with continuing to take low doses of naltrexone (1 - 5mg) to see if it helps with cravings or the a speedier upregulation of dopamine. If things are still rough in 7-10 days time, I’ll probably go back to my taper.

While I don’t recommend taking naltrexone in the manner I did, I will say that I’m astounded by its efficacy. I feel no continued physical withdrawal symptoms and have zero desire (at least for now) to take any of the kratom in my cupboard. If people find this information helpful, I will continue to post updates over the next couple of weeks.

So I'm on day 6 of quitting for a third time. From my last quit to this quit its been about 3 months. 180 lbs currently, 5'10"" and 24 years old. Used maximum 20 grams a day give or take depending on a weekend or weekday and a gym day or not. I'd like to share what's on my mind. I hope it inspires some but I'm also afraid some pessimistic views may shine through. But before you read that just know I have NO intention to ever dabble with this stuff, not even once. Anyway, this is a very long one, so thank you if you manage to read it all. If not, even typing it all out and reading other posts is thereupetic enough.

So for my current withdrawals. For me personally, the most bothersome WD symptom I have is lack of motivation, fatigue and constant discomfort. My girlfriend works every 2nd weekend out of town and while I was in K the house would always be spotless or near spotless when she came back. Now, I have no drive to do anything. I pushed myself to wash some of the dishes that have stacked up since last weekend that I haven't had the energy to do myself and laundry is so backed up. I could only manage to wash like 2/3s of our dishes. My work performance has plummeted. I suffered from insomnia for the first two nights. Now i just sleep a little less. Anxiety is crazy but I'm also consuming caffeine. Stomach issues are out of this world and I've lost motivation to do old hobbies.

A little bit of my story. I use to do tons of ecstasy, lsd, sometimes coke and what not when I was younger. I overdosed on codeine and laid on my death bed unable to make peace with myself as I was convinced this was the end. Unable to make peace because of the wrongs I did in the past and the path I walked on. I'm 24 years old now, haven't touched any of the drugs i quit since going on 12 years ago. I have pride to know that I've been clean for so long. Going back to 2019 though, I start a new job in commercial plumbing. My journeyman is sooo amped up, extremely euphoric and just radiating good vibes. Eventually he introduced me to his secret which was kratom. I had no idea of its addictive properties and didn't research it at all. He gave me some every day at work until I eventually bought my own. Eventually going through a kilo every 3 weeks or so and dosing 3 times a day usually.

Fast forward to winter of 2020, I met this girl that I'm with today. I start a new job, the coworker is no longer there and I gain the courage to quit finally.

In the spring of 2020 my new job came to an end and I went to my old company but my old coworker wasn't there. I was only 95% back to normal and even though I worked hard, my boss who would be coked up wasn't 100% satisfied with my performance. My old coworker comes to this site and he's of course still on the K and doing it openly. He bugs me from time to time to do it so I can be full of energy and well, you guys know the deal of what it does for you. I denied until he bugged me to do it infront of our boss and then i had both of them bugging me, I caved.

I then relapsed fully, back to my old dose of a kilo every 3 weeks but instead of regular strain I got ""super"" strains. For my birthday in November my girlfriend surprised me with a plane ticket to see my family in Edmonton. I decided to not bring any K just to avoid a hassle at the airport and would buy in Edmonton from a smoke shop... turns out it's fully banned there so I was withdrawing for 4 days and totally ruined our trip because I had no energy to do anything she planned. Or if I did go, I was just a mess. She was so ashamed of me and I knew I had to quit.

So January of 2021 I brought myself to quit. It was HELL. I was absolutely useless at work and I was working with the most nicest dude ever and felt bad that all the pressure to finish some jobs were all on him but he had a body count of 2. I could hardly climb up a ladder, I was running to the outhouse all the time. I'm sure you guys all know the feeling. I got through the physical wds about 3 weeks later and my girlfriend and her family were so so proud of me. I eventually left that job to go to school for my 3rd year of plumbing school.

Near the end of my schooling the exams got involved in a area of plumbing I've never experienced so it was getting challenging. We had exams 2x a week and I know doing kratom any more then that will eventually get you hooked. I bought a bag only for exam days and did it behind my girlfriends back. Rapidly 2x a week went to 7 and I was full blown relapsing again. This time in secret. It was known to my friends and girlfriend that I quit. But it was my dirty little secret that I relapsed. To avoid getting caught I refused to order online in case she saw the package when I was at work and catch me. So i would go to the smoke shop where they charge $1 a gram. This was extremely expensive and I was doing maximum 20 grams a day and since I was in school I was constantly broke. This started in mid-late March.

Fast forward about 3 months to last Monday. I'm still hiding this from my girlfriend. We plan a nice evening on the beach downtown together when I got home. I bought groceries so I told her that I'll be quick putting them away and for her to get ready in the bedroom. I tried sneaking a dose but she ended up coming out to the kitchen to see me rinsing a glass caked of green mud... the disappointment in her eyes was painful. She cancelled the plans and said she doesn't want to be with an addict and she's been there for me twice now and doesn't know if she can do it a third time. I dumped everything out right there except one last dose i had in a Tupperware container and took it as my final one the next morning which was last Tuesday.

Just a backstory on her. Drugs has affected her family in a terrible way. She had a step dad who she loved dearly but saw him turn into a heroin addict and went from being a sweet guy who was there for her and getting her gifts to suddenly stealing back those gifts and arguing with her mom. It tore her family and her heart apart.

We were planning on trying for kids in September. She now says she doesn't know if she sees that with me. While I'm at home withdrawing she's out hanging with ""friends"" who always text her calling her sugar and asking for her to come chill with them and cruise in ""the caddy"" not only am I battling withdrawals in the spare bedroom with no a/c during a 45 degree Celsius heat wave now.. I'm constantly worrying about her, checking her snapchat and snapmaps and she will ignore my texts but will be online. I've developed trust issues and so has she in me. Going through heartbreak with someone who you've planned a future with and going through a shame-filled withdrawal hell at the same time is something I wouldn't wish on anyone. Her mom and sisters use to message me and have small talk or invite me out while my girlfriend was out of town working. Now they don't message me at all anymore... I truly believe my girlfriend hasn't done anything unfaithful for the record. But since we've been rocky even a bit prior to me being caught I've hung out with her friends without her which resulted in her avoiding them now and needing to get out of the house so she responds to people who are pos because just being out is an escape for her and she wouldn't normally respond to them at all. So now I'm finding myself avoiding those friends of hers I've hung out with just for her to leave behind those people who have low intentions and hopefully have her go back to her trustworthy friends... it's messed up and silly i know.

Anyway, It's been a full 5 days 4 hours and about 5 minutes since my last dose as I write this. So going on day 6. I'm writing a journal about my days of withdrawing so if I ever get tempted to even dabble once in a while like I did in school I've promised to at least read this journal and ask if it's worth it. Included in this journal I started it with why I want to quit and how it's tearing my romantic and personal relationships apart. How I'm just like a dog returning to consume its own vomit, and what I hate about this green stuff. I know I've got a looooong road ahead of me. Me and my girlfriend argue almost every day now. My relationship is in shambles, she doesn't want to support me and im so ashamed of turning into an addict when i vowed to be sober from when i overdosed. My past and how I was on a good path until K has resulted in me telling a very small amount of people. I feel like I'm literally on a path made of coals with legs that make me walk slow, each foot being a day and the path feeling like it's miles long. I feel like support is what turns these coals down into dull embers at times, but the only place I really have is this place and a few select friends for support. If I do split from my girlfriend my method of recovery from a breakup is spending time with friends, road trips, adventures, rebuilding confidence and forming new bonds with people. But withdrawals have it so I can't bring myself to do that.

Anyway, even though my post seems to be a doom and gloom I do have hope. But it's f***ing hard and honestly sometimes reading people still struggling on day 25 which feels like miles away is hard to take in. But that's no reason to suddenly undo my progress. I find it hard to pass time right now. My friend group has shrunk considerably. My girlfriend is extremely shy and never met really any of my friends until 10 months into our relationship so I just joined her friend group from the start. I've become so comfortable with her friends but now with us being on edge she gets pissed if i hang with her friends so I'm turning into an outcast. I look back at my old friends and 75% of them are people I don't want to be apart of anymore and the other 25% are either way too busy or their schedules never align with mine and honestly it's a small number of people anyway. 've had many opportunities to form new connections in these last 6 days by meeting up with very good influences. Being myself, before or on kratom would jump on that and my shining personality would be a great impression. My dream job has always been to be a pilot, the other night I found a phone downtown and had ID In it with an address so I returned it and a young guy my age who is a pilot offered to take me out for beers with his other pilot friends. I want to go so bad but I know my personality is dulled  right now and I'm honestly not fun to be around at the moment. Who knows how long this will last. By the time I'm normal again it could be 3 weeks from now and my opportunity could have passed by then.

Okay, I've ranted enough. I hope somehow someone sees light in this going through a similar struggle or maybe they think they have it bad and I somehow have it worse yet they still see the hope I have and are inspired. I hope my darkness and pessimistic sentences haven't dulled the hope I do have behind these words. I know I'll get there eventually, and readers, if you're going through something similar then I know you can too. I can't wait until I'm myself again, confident, lively, and able to travel the world without having the need to be on K and sneak it with me on my travels. If I work things out with my girlfriend, great. If i dont, well at least by the time I'm over this relationship I'll also be over the K and can shine as bright if not brighter then when I was on K. Much love and good luck to those still in the early days like myself. Thanks for reading this far.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5010416}"

Started doing it to bridge the gap between oxycodone days. Quit oxy November 2020 and haven’t looked back since. 

I’ve been around the block with opiates for the better part of a decade. At one point, I was on suboxone for about a year exclusively and somehow got off of that crazy train and lived to tell about it.

Now the issue is quitting kratom. Since November, my daily use has sky rocketed to 60 gpd give or take. I’d say 30 or so of that is the opms shots. Basically, every 3-4 hours or so I was either doing a shot or 8-10g of leaf. 

I quit all of it CT 2 days ago and I want to talk about the subtleties of the WD. I’d rank intensity of withdrawal as follows Dilaudid>oxycodone>heroin>suboxone > kratom. Now, notice I said intensity, and not ease. By far the hardest of those all were the bupenorphine. That shit took 2 months to finally be able to sleep again and not sweat a gallon on the way to the mailbox. The oxy and the H, we’re fast and furious. Basically 3-5 days of pure hell, but you see the light much quicker than the others. 

Now to kratom. This green devil is the TOUGHEST mentally. I mean, I can’t fucking shake the desire to go 1 minute down the road and slap a 20 on the counter and have a shot in me. The ease of which is ridiculous. That is what makes this so hard. Honestly, the physical of the mitragynane and associated alkaloids is tolerable compared to the others, but the mental is by far the toughest. 

Anyway, my 2 cents if anyone is in the same boat and has a bunch of experience with other full agonists. You will be surprised at how benign the kick is compared to the harder stuff. Don’t get me wrong; you will not be able to trust a fart, sleep for a few nights, and you will certainly sweat on the way to the bathroom to wipe your ass from the shart. It’s pretty classic WD symptoms, just knocked down a notch. For those of you who have never experienced anything but kratom, then yeah, you are in for some very sucky days. 
Thanks for reading my blurb and the act of writing this down has helped kill 20 minutes of this awfully shitty day. I’m going to hang in there and just know I love this forum.

First quit started back 21 days after CT and second time it was almost 50days.  I’ve learned my lesson.  Can’t take Kratom just one time.  One time leads to a year of use.  So I hope things will be different.  This past year I’ve been taking 4/5 gold extract capsules a day.  Cut down to three a day and then just went CT.  I’m on day 10 now and maybe it’s experience or the mega dosing vitamin C or the gabapentin this time but withdrawals have kinda sucked and kinda been okay.  I was scared shitless about quitting extracts.  I made the jump with courage one day and you can too.  Mega dose vitamin C, black seed oil, 5htp, t - theanine, DLOA, SAM~E, and if you can get 30-50mg gabapentin.....I think you’ll experience bad but not horrible withdrawals.  I stop the low dose of gabapentin tomorrow morning.  Down to taking 600mg a day.  Maybe tomorrow 300mg if I need it and then off.  It’s still had some anxiety.

If you take the time to read this, I appreciate you.","I'm lost. So fucking lost. I want to start by saying that I originally started getting into Kratom as a replacement for heroin/fentanyl. While I dont think that fact makes my situation worse than any of you that havent been down that road, I think it does complicate things. 

I dont know why I keep coming back. I think a lot of it has to do with childhood physical and mental abuse from my father, seeing my mother at a fairly young age in a casket, and honestly, ADHD. 

I want to be clean so bad. I have a back n forth relationship with this shit. I start taking it for the benefits, as we all do. See all the damage it causes slowly worsen. I watch my hair fall out in the shower, and my hairline slowly receding. My skin is blotchy and my acne is awful due to the disgusting film like oily layer that's left ab an hour or two after every dose. I look at myself in the mirror and tear up, fully aware of the hold that opiates have seemed to maintain over me for a couple years now. 

I quit heroin cold turkey for ab a week, beating the withdrawals by not leaving my grandmothers bathroom for the better part of 3 days. 3 days of tears and staring into the mirror, talking to myself. Not a seconds of sleep. Completely delusional. 3 days of hell, but I did it. 

What followed was weeks of discomfort I had never known. Being bored alone is enough to be 'painful' in a sense to a lot of us w ADHD, but this was different. The RLS, my eyes darting around a crowded room to check on every single last movement in the area. Pure paranoia. Pure hell. And then I found Kratom.

I'm afraid. Every time I put it down I think of heroin again. Everytime. I find myself trying to justify excuses to go do some lines and fall out for a few good hours. Excuses, excuses, excuses. I hate it. I hate who I have become. I dont understand it. My mom was an addict, and now she is gone. my dad was an addict, and it led him to prison. My grandfather ODed in a hotel room by his self on fentanyl, and I'm pretty sure it was a suicide. He sent me my first alcoholics anonymous book. He said this was doable. He was the reason I quit h to begin with... and he blocked me the day before he did that..

I'm lost. When I'm high, people enjoy being around me more. My girl feeds off of the chemical confidence that I radiate when I'm on kratom. The way she looks at me is so different. I know she loves me without it, but the difference is real. I feel alive, but in such a 2d way. It keeps H off of my mind (obviously bc I'm replacing it w something similar) and keeps me pushing forward. But I'm seeing the negative effects creep up. And from the looks of it, reading all of your stories, it can only get so much worse from here.

Guys I have a kid on the way..... and my heart hurts for that kid right now, because I am still very much the same person I was, just without the heroin. I'm afraid. I found my dad's heroin stash. I seen the nods, I heard the bullshit lies and I witnessed that look in his eyes the day he almost overdosed. ""I dont want to do to you what my dad did yo me"" is what he would say. And then he did it. But the worst part is that I know he was trying, at least at times. The demons just got the best of him. That DNA is in me though. Now it's my turn to try to break this generational cycle. And it feels so lonely.

It's hard to formulate this right now. I havent taken Kratom in 2 days. But laying this all out on the table right now is making me want to take more. And knowing me I probably will. 

You guys seem to really care. Any words or energy you think will be beneficial is welcome. At this point I'm desperate. Not for my sake. But for my kid.

I still get waves of depression and hopelessness, but they pass pretty quickly and I’m noticing they come less frequently now. I tapered from about 15-20 grams over 5 years. I jumped at 5 grams and felt very minor physical withdrawals. Here are some things that helped in the first month:

1. Exercise. Everyone says it, and I know it’s annoying to read when you feel like shit, but it’s true. I made sure I was in good running shape before quitting, and I had to build back up endurance through withdrawals, but now I’m back up to running 4-5 miles.
2. Reading, or anything you like to do to occupy the mind and make time pass faster. I had a stack of books ready when I quit.
3. Staying busy, being social. This was the hardest part for me because I didn’t feel like doing much, but once I forced myself, I was fine. I found I enjoyed being around people so much more without kratom. 
4. Having a mantra when I get any urges creeping in. For me, it’s “that part of my life is over now.” Something that shuts down the addict brain that will try to convince you that you need kratom just this one time for ________ reason.
5. Patience and awareness. Mentally, I had some dark days. I had to be really patient with myself and aware that my brain is repairing itself. What you feel in those first few weeks is temporary. 
6. Reading people’s stories here: it’s been a lifeline since most people I know don’t know about kratom. 

Things that haven’t really helped at all:
1. Alcohol. I’m at a point now where I can have one drink, but any more than that and I feel right back in withdrawals the next day.
2. Mid-afternoons. I have to have something planned for this time, like a long walk with the dog.  
3. Negative self talk and regret: what purpose does this serve?

I've posted here and there on this sub for the last few months, and have made some posts talking about quitting soon, tapering, and etc etc...

Truth is, I have tried tapering for about the last month or so, and it just doesn't work for me. I always seem to screw it up and take more some days than I should (with a good excuse, mind you) and have been fluctuating from about 25/30 gpd (I have never, ever measured it out) to around 40/50 gpd. Tapering methods don't work for rationalizing addict brains like mine. It has been a farce pretty much from the start, aside from the fact that I was able to come down to around 25 gpd (as of yesterday) from where I was when I was maxed out about 2 months ago (50/60 gpd I estimate).

Well, I told my wife I would quit and give it up for good ct like a week ago. Guess what...that didn't end up being the case. Surprised? Me neither. I told her last night that it had been about 5 or 6 days (lie) and then she called me out soon after, when she told me she saw me doing a quick toss back in the bedroom yesterday evening. Dumb addict me thought I was so slick about it, then on top of that, I hid what I had left up in the closet. Well guess what? Wife found it and now it's gone. So I am sitting here this morning having taken nothing at all since last night around 6 pm.

I woke up this morning, and literally one of the first things that popped in my head was ""oh shit that's right, the kratom...what should I do?"" So, the brilliant formulator I am, I decided to search the trash of course in the kitchen for the K bag my wife found that I mentioned. As I was pulling random discarded objects from the trash and laying them on the floor next to the can, I couldn't help but think, ""what the fuck am I doing?"" It felt literally beyond ridiculous. I mean, looking through the trash for this shit and putting THAT much of a priority on it, and not much (if at all) on some things that are actually important?

I am just so wore out from this struggle, folks. I have been on/off this crap for like almost 2 years. I got back on it back in FEB when I quit doing fent, and have been on the K since about FEB 6. And it has been HELL. The lying to my wife, the wasting money I definitely should not be wasting, the needing a dose before doing literally anything at all in life, the constant and total dependency, the sneaking around, the constant thoughts of whether or not it's time for a dose, etc...I just can't do it anymore. It is just too much. It is holding me back from SO much I feel like. Not to mention, I have a baby girl due in mid-August, so it probably goes without saying that I have to give it up.

And of all days, too. I'm sitting here on the couch right now, kinda torn with the thoughts I am having about feeling like crap later on this evening when it is time to do fireworks with my sons. This is literally how it has been for years. All holidays, birthdays, vacations, etc...dominated and/or ruined by addiction related behavior. It's been a long time coming, my fine friends. I am hoping I can get a grip and find the strength to do this. God, please give me the strength to do this...pray for me folks, and I will do the same for you all. You folks are definitely a blessing to have around, even though I don't know any of you personally. It is nice to know I am not alone in this all-out war...though I wish none of us were going through this. It must be for SOME reason though, right? I like to think it most definitely is for us all.

I could never just fully jump from my daily Kratom habit (which peaked at 50-60 grams a day a while back) because I am a father with a full time job. I could never accomplish both duties successfully while in full withdrawal, so I've been tapering. I've been tapering for a very very long time now. 

The Kratom habit started roughly 4 years ago and of course was intially a very positive thing in my life. It still would be if I had not become a chronic daily user. I feel the same is true for all drugs for the most part. But initially Kratom got my mind and habit off of the harder stuff (any opioid I could get my hands on, really. I did all of them including heroin once or twice). As well, I experienced a family separation and divorce that was so fierce I developed ptsd and insomnia. This is when Xanax came into my life as well but I wanted to mention that even though sobriety is the goal here, Kratom also helped me get through a very very brutal divorce. Ptsd symptoms have subsided since for the most part but the fear of it returning always lingers in the background.

So, currently I'm down to 6.5 grams daily but not without the help of my Xanax prescription which is pretty light now just .5 milligrams a day. Full disclosure. I'm not sure I could have tapered down so rapidly without it. That, and I got lucky and made quite a bit of money investing in AMC stock and was able to quit my job entirely so that I could focus on getting sober and getting my self and my life back. From the looks of it, I'll be able to stay unemployed for a lot longer if I choose with the help of AMC (The price is expected to sky rocket) until I am completely sober. Then I may re-enter back into the workforce or I may just Invest full time since I've discovered how much I enjoy it and that it can be a great source of income if you work hard enough at it.

Anyways, thats my progress update. Please feel free to ask me any questions. I plan on tapering all the way down to 1 or 2 grams a day before I decide to jump. I wanna make sure that when I quit, I quit for good with very little chance of relapse back into chronic usage again. For me and my brain chemistry it just feels like the smarter way to go about it. Mind you, I've been tapering for a long time now(and I've tried to quit many many times) but it hasn't just been a straight line down.

Today was different. After my morning 2g dose I expected to be clear of wd until mid afternoon. Surprise! Relief lasted only 2 hours,  then got hit with a burning discomfort through my entire upper torso.. at times felt like collapsing into tears. Took some supplements and laid down which helped.

But it was literally one 6 gram dose so I'm not going to count all the way back to day 1 because of it. Anyways, hairloss has been talked about many times on this sub. It's also one of the reasons I quit. Basically the first month of withdrawal my hair was falling out in clumps. By the third month it basically stopped completely. 

But the really weird thing is that I noticed a strong correlation to my diet and hair loss.  Particularly salt, sugar, and carbs. For whatever reason these things  (maybe not the salt) 100% cause the hair loss to return. And also my  skin has been getting weird reactions as well. Within 20-30 minutes after eating anything with sugar, I will get EXTREMELY EXHAUSTED. I will notice my hair loss increases. And my skin will get dry wrinkly,  greasy, bumpy etc. However these reactions have gone down considerably in intensity. Less hairloss/ less impact on skin. Less anxiety/heart racing. It sounds pretty scary. But where the hairloss, bad skin was constant, now it's really only after eating sugar, or carbs. I can also eat more, and get less side effects than lets say the first month.

 But I still find it very very strange that there even is a correlation. It's like kratom completely messed up my ability to digest certain foods.

Yet these night sweats. What is that about? Im not totally sure because I'm 52 and I'm showing signs of the age related hormone shifts going on. My wife had helped me identify it because she started having that a couple years ago. 

I read that low testosterone can produce night sweats. 

Is the night sweats related more to the fact that im tapering. I don't experience any other WD symptoms when I woke up sweaty and was able to fall back asleep,  no RLS etc

I gotta research it,  but was I doing something to me testosterone levels when I abused kratom,  and is some correction going on through my tapering?

I had a whole bag of Kratom when I got home from the hospital waiting on me. I instantly threw that crap out. I've fully healed from my surgery, have went back to work my manual labor job in construction without worrying about Kratom. Those first few weeks are tough, but once you get through it...it's home free from there. I'm so glad I quit. I feel better mentally and physically. I even lost 20 pounds and no longer have a bloated gut from Kratom. It sucks it took for me to go to the hospital to quit but it is what it is. I feel great, my relationships are great.

I’m happy to report that I am coming out of the fog after 2 weeks of hell. I had it all…the depression, regret, constant self-bashing, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, severe headaches, return with a vengeance of masked neck pain, lethargy.

I’m not out of the woods by any means. I realize I am just at the start of my journey. But I am so thankful to not be despondent like I was earlier.

I figured I’d post just to let anyone going through the hell of quitting Kratom that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I’m no one to give advice, so do what you want with my next bit of disclosure. 

I found a psychiatrist who was familiar with addiction and went to see him. Having professional guidance through this process has been a God-send. Being able to talk frankly about the experience (without being embarrassed or concerned about worrying or burdening friends and/or family) really helps. Plus, knowing you are being guided through the process by an expert is incredibly reassuring.

My psychiatrist did prescribe me gabapentin. I was leery about going on a medication for withdrawal, but I did it and the effects were instantly noticeable. I still feel withdrawal symptoms, but they are so much more manageable. It’s not an opiate withdrawal medication per say, so I’m happy that, as far as I’m concerned, I’m not substituting one addiction for another. Will I need it forever? I don’t know. But I’m just happy to not be suffering the way I was.

Take my words with a grain of salt…I’m not a doctor or addiction expert. I’m just a regular guy who is grateful that I’m feeling better.

I was at 50 grams a day, and was even using extract shots the last week on top of it because I was so nervous and coming off Phenibut as well. I was given phenobarbital which doesn’t help with symptoms but prevented my seizures from Phenibut withdrawal. The past two nights I got four hours of sleep. This is unreal for me usually in withdrawals I am getting barely anything the first whole week and into the next. I cold turkeyed. I’m in a facility and I am not using any supplements or anything to make me feel better. The only differences this time are I’m drinking a shit ton of water, taking vitamins and my attitude.

This is my estimate and I’m curious how yall think it is w/r/t accuracy. I am being purposefully vague since we can’t mention brands on here, but I know my fellow extract quitters will get this:

Premium extract shot: 18 g 
Premium extract capsule: 12 g each/24 g per package
Regular extract shot: 12-14 g depending on the brand

A quick backstory, I started using kratom sporadically in the beginning of 2021. It started off as once or twice a week. Of course overtime this progressed into 4 times a week and then recently everyday for the last 2 weeks to a month. I liked the effect of kratom but with my addictive personality I quickly realized this isn’t something I should have in my life. I really enjoyed taking it before lifting, it helped me workout longer and harder.

Anyways, my grams per day have been about 4-7 (7 being the high end). I only dose once per day and never really have the urge to dose twice. A few weeks ago I picked up Phenibut to help with the kratom withdrawal (bad idea) until I realized it was more addictive than kratom, so I got off the phenibut and went back to kratom 😂

Things are going okay. Not great, not horrible. Just living life.

My first 5 days were the hardest. By day 10 I was feeling pretty good. After a couple of weeks the days just started ticking along. 

I haven’t had many cravings but when I have had them I just remembered what all I went through to get off it and I would kind of play the tape out. What would happen if I were to use? I would go get it hating myself the entire way, then I would take it knowing I shouldn’t, then I might get a buzz or maybe just start uncontrollably shaking. Who knows? Then either I would shamefully restart my clock or, more likely, end up using multiple times a day again. If that happened I would have to eventually relive withdrawing again or die. So…probably not worth it. That’s what I do when a craving hits anyway.

I haven’t posted in a while but I am reading a book right now and the following passage spoke to me and reminded me what it was like before and during my taper:

“My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer,” the boy said. “Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dreams, because every second of the search is a second’s encounter with God and with eternity.” Said the man.

I thought about how I was so afraid of the suffering I would face when I quit. The reality though, for me at least, was that I was already suffering much worse than I would during withdrawal. 

Life isn’t perfect with or without your DOC but I’d say you aren’t actually living life if you’re still using. Get back to your life! It is waiting for you, believe it or not.

Thanks to everyone in this group. You helped so much to this point and you still help me now.

I officially made it a month and it's surreal. The ""coming back online"" feeling I've had the last 2 weeks has been absolutely incredible. I haven't had too many physical cravings since the second week, and almost all of my ""cravings"" are really my body telling me I need something (e.g. I'm thirsty, I need to work out, I'm bored, I'm having anxiety, etc.). To some it may be obvious, but the big lightbulb moment came when I realized that the cravings I've been feeling are actually just emotions or physical sensations that, because they're sometimes uncomfortable, I just ignore and use my magic feel-good button to suppress. The result has been one of the most eventful and successful months I've had in years. Plugging back into old, abandoned relationships. Pursuing hobbies and interests I've let fall by the wayside. Putting effort into a new career.

My body is still not at 100%, my digestive system is still figuring itself back out. But it gets better every day. Energy levels come and go, but I'm beginning to realize the power of momentum in my energy levels. When I'm feeling the most down, if I make myself complete some basic, nonthinking task such as loading the dishwasher or brushing my teeth, it makes it easier to use that as a jumping-off point to getting other things done.  


I can't express my gratitude for this community. Thinking back to the 3 or so months I lurked this subreddit before taking the dive, the fears and doubts, the desperation I wasn't quite letting myself feel, I am so proud of myself for making it through the first month.  


I know it takes consistent effort to truly be done with any addiction, and I know I won't always feel so excited and pumped, but today I am one month clean, and at least for today, I don't need to get high. And that's enough for me.

Last night, I decided to have a few drinks (3) made some nice patron margaritas…anyways fast forward to 1am that night, I wake up feeling nauseous, and stomach ache, which was super weird because normally I can drink like 6 margaritas and be fine sleep like a baby... I’ve had weird stomach things going on since Day 1 CT up until now (without alcohol)
DRINKING DURING KRATOM WD STORY:  anyway I ended up puking my brains out, not able to sleep tossing and turning from 1am- on.. I attributed it to kratom wd.. However this was pure hell. Sitting in stomach pain for hours and hours  my clever ‘addict brain’ convinced me of a brilliant way to solve my issue. 

Why don’t I just pick up a couple of kratom shots just for  today?? I mean I’ve never  had stomach pain like this in my life. Just for today though.  “Then continue CT the following day” ( never works out like that for me 🙄😁)

I drive up to the shop, wait 15 minutes for it to open, as addict me wanted my fix and arrived to the store before the employees. 🙄Bought the shots, quickly jumped into my car and pull 1 shot out of the bag. I take the shot. Sit in the parking lot for a few minutes just to see how I react. Will this pain subside?

Within 1 min of taking the shot I jump out of my car and puke my brains out. Imagine projectile vomiting brown sludge. That was me. It looked nasty. Handful of pedestrians watching me like any other Thursday at 8am on this busy street. 😂



I drive home, not feeling any of the k cause I puked it all up before it could be absorbed . And continue to suffer my symptoms for a few more hours. 

It’s the afternoon and I realize, shit, there’s 2 more k shots in my car. I walked outside to my car, opened the 2 containers and emptied the sludge onto the grass before tossing the shot container in the trash. WIN 🏅 never done this before !

Day 7 CT begins in a few hours now and I’m happy to say I did not relapse. Won’t be drinking for awhile, at least till  withdrawals are over 😁

 I've been lurking around on here anonymously and have waiting to write this.

 I appreciate the other posters and have learned a ton of useful info.

 My story:  7 years ago I got into a life threating car accident on my way home from work. Typical story, depression, anger, giving into prescription pain pills to cope.   Luckily I get through 3 months of being on a couch with the help of great family. After the three months I don't have access to buying prescription drugs nor the money too.  After my Dr. scolds me for showing signs of abusing, he cuts me off cold turkey. That was that.  Because of the small dosing I have very little side effects and only use randomly when a friend offers me pills.

  I've always had addiction problems, and somehow I can always find a way to be highly functioning and ""responsible looking.""  I teach High School and use to love my job.  It kept me busy and during the school year I would focus on work instead of how to feel unnaturally euphoric.  

 I'm pretty strong at developing excellent teacher/student relationships, and some students will confide in me if I ask how they're really doing... One of these convo's led me down a dark road that I think about almost daily.

 A student who had talked to me about addiction problems before, told me of a legal drug that her friends took that had the same effect as an opioid.  I (of course) warned her against it and filed it away in my brain.  Like any talk of ""new drugs"" that were ""legal"" within days I found myself at a head shop purchasing a 5 gram $5 bottle of Kratom.

  Soon I'm absolutely hooked. I go from pill form to powder. From 2 grams a day to 20 like it's nothing.  I get ""caught"" by my wife and laugh it off. I start hiding it and taking it daily.  The costs are racking up and I start finding elaborate ways of making sure I can sustain a $50 a week addiction.  Within a year I'm onto liquid form and now it's close to $100 a week.  

 My personality changes.  I feel like I can't have ""real conversations"" without being high on Kratom.  School is brutal, as I just try to get through the day so I can have my dose and mix it with booze.  I get caught every few months and promise to quit/lie about how much I'm taking and how much it costs our family.  After year 4 I'm up to 40 g a day and half a bottle of liquid.  

 My wife finds a huge powder bag and tells me if I don't get help on my own it's rehab time.  I go to a therapist that my school district offers for free. I show up to the meetings high and decide to cut back instead of quit.  Instead of quitting I start taking the high powered pills to make it easier to hide and mix it with liquid.  

  These pills are brutal. Super highs and then super lows the whole day until 3:30 when I can have another one.  This controls my life.  I'm one person when on it, one person when I'm off it.  Basically hibernating during the day/at work and then super out going and fired up all afternoon.

  The worst part is that while I'm flying my kids only know me as this Kratom person.  My drinking sky rockets with these high powered pills and my wife and I grow apart daily. She knows I'm different and basically cuts me off from any real intimacies because she says ""I've changed.""

  I try quitting multiple times and only last a day or two before convincing myself to just have ""a little"" to stop the depression and withdrawals.  Within days I'm back to my usual dosing and I make up dates where I'll ""stop.""

  I make quick friends with a neighbor who's a great dude and has no idea what I'm up too. He just loves having someone to hang out with and have fun with.  We grow super close, but he only knows me as a secret Kratom addict who's high and full of phony energy.

  Finally. Finally. My wife figures out how much I'm spending by asking me why I have a credit card I'm not telling her about. It's been 5 long years of abusing and training my body to need Kratom... She asks to log in to my secret card and finds that I've spent over 4 grand in less than a year at a head shop.  

  I'm almost ecstatic because the guilt is fing killing me.  My whole life was being controlled by the urge to use.  Every day was the same. I couldn't do a weekend without using. I couldn't go on vacation without figuring out how to sneak pills into luggage.  Anytime I was out of money I would feel the worst depression of my life after only 24 hours of not using.  When the money is realized it's now ""go into rehab time.""

  I'm deathly afraid of the stigma of rehab.  I start to cry and beg her to let me try one more time to quit on my own... She tells me I have to give her every card in my wallet... That I need to be completely sober (no drinking) for the month of Feb 21.   I have 3 high powered pills left and I split them all in half.  I take half of each for 6 days. 7 days later my legs have stopped shaking at night and I feel great... I've made it a week and the sky's the limit. Feb 28th comes and I'm a few weeks clean of Kratom.  I feel an emptiness but that voice inside of me tells me that at anytime I can just have one pill when I see so and so.  I keep that down for another couple of weeks and try to figure out a way to enjoy life without feeling high.

  March Madness arrives and a friend asks me to go to a Casino so that we can bet on games and live it up.  I break and purchase 3 pills.  I go from those 3 to using on weekends, to using daily within 2 weeks.  I fail. I'm heartbroken and my wife starts to notice the same pattern. I lie my way out of it for 2 more months... Then the reckoning. 

  School has just ended and I'm ready to really party. I get home and go to put my pill bag in my pocket when I turn around and my wife is standing behind me. She starts to cry and asks for the pills... It's my kids bday party the next day and I tell her I'll go to rehab, let's just enjoy our kids bday. That keeps things peaceful... Sadly the next day, I steal money from my older son to get pills so that I can be ""present"" and joyful at my 8 years bday.  I get so messed up that I steal wine coolers from the shut down restaurant counter to keep the buzz going strong during the party.

 This is a new low. I've now agreed to rehab which will cost us who knows how much... I can't even stand my kids bday party without having a pill and a half and multiple drinks.  I literally feel like I'm scum and don't want to live anymore.

  Months before I had promised my father in law that I can barely stand that I'd go to a silent Catholic retreat with him in June.  4 days after my kids party it's time to fulfill that Kratom driven promise from almost a year ago.  I'm feeling so low after the party that I decide that being at a 4 day silent retreat in the middle of nowhere will be a perfect time to go through withdrawals. 

 I show up  the first night high and drunk and bring 0 Kratom with me.  I wake up the next morning feeling great and ready to try and get through the withdrawals... Withdrawals from these high powered pills (for me) is close to unbearable.  I immediately feel depressed and my mind thinks about Kratom almost continuity.  I don't want to eat. I don't want to talk (which is awesome at a silent retreat) and I go through cold sweats off and on.

  I'm not super religious but I will say to anyone out there that's made it this far in my long post, that this retreat is one of the defining moments in my life... It's highly structured with almost every waking moment accounted for.  The content was amazing and almost tailored (unintentionally) too an addict.  I felt worse than I had since my accident for 4 days but the talks and meditation got me through.  

  Every night my legs shook uncontrollably.  I felt like I wasn't sleeping and sitting in a chair made me feel uncomfortable beyond words.  Despite everything, for the first time in 5 years my mind is telling me ""you're really done.""  I don't know how that happened, but again... my mind accepted that I was done.  

 Even writing this, I wanted to have some awesome ""epiphany moment"" to tell people going through this... but the key was so difficult/simple all at once.  I had had enough. I was done. 

 I didn't make any deals with myself as always.  I didn't decide to taper down to stop my legs from shaking at night. I just accepted that I was finished.  I freed myself.  I accepted that I did this to myself and feeling low and uncomfortable was part of the deal. 

  Now, did it suck? Yes.  I don't feel like being social even 21 days later.  My legs still shake a bit when I first lie down (sometimes I have to change rooms to not keep my wife awake.)  But some days I feel happy just from watching my kid hit a little league home run and realize what it's like to feel happy again.  

  Do I run over to my neighbors every time he walks outside anymore? No.  But we've played golf sober and just enjoyed conversation.  I haven't done that in literally 5 years... 

  21 days without Kratom and no plans to start over again...

  I have minor urges daily. That voice telling me that I can just buy a little for the party were having... Or telling myself if I make it 30 days I can have a get together and just have a liquid...

  All I can tell anyone out there once you've decided that you're really done, you can then tell yourself ""nope, I'm not starting again no matter the deal."" I've built up equity with myself and with my family... I can now sit still and watch a stupid kids show with my kids hanging on me... I can hold a convo with my wife and just ""be.""

  3 weeks and I'm still just believing that it's over.  When you're done... you can be done.  I realized that no one had control over me but me.  I control if I walk into that stupid store.  I control whether I make a deal with myself or if I laugh and tell myself ""do you really want to ruin this again?""

  Am I still going to have to go to rehab (my greatest fear????)  I don't think so... My wife and I have known each other for 22 years and she tells me daily how nice it is to have me back.  She's scared but she's hopeful for the first time that I can remember.

  Will something change?  Hell no.  I'm done with this.  

  I'll update asap.  Thanks for reading and listening. I wish you the best.

Suddenly itchy!,"I have been using kratom for over a year, but quite heavily for the last 8 months or so (30-40 gpd). I made the decision to taper off, and it's been difficult, but it's going well. I'm now only using around 5 gpd and the depression, anxiety, and twitchy limbs are all past, which is fantastic. 

However this week I've been very, very itchy, which is just incredibly annoying. Does anyone else have similar experiences? Anyone know if there's anything I can do to help ease the itches? I've tried antihistamines, hot baths, but they're only providing a marginal benefit, if any.

Idk if im just tripping, but since i have used kratom daily for around a year my skin on my face has started wrinkling some. I drink plenty of water so dehydration shouldnt be the issue. Am i alone here? Is kratom to blame? Have had extensive bloodwork done and am perfectly healthy. My main question being if i quit will my face return back to normal? Its the driving factor behind my want to quit. Quitting has been hard as im extremely busy and can’t just CT it. Tapering is also tough as my mind associates the drug with a certain feeling that ive grown to chase. Ugh.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5021618}"

I'm pretty much a total recluse and a loner, in a pretty lonely and miserable place.  I don't wanna leave my apartment, and don't unless I really have to.  I have a wonderful wife who supports me, and has been really patient with all of this, so my relationship is okay.  
My Head is in this super dark and nihilistic place where I have disdain for everything & everyone.  I feel like I've become a total prick.  I avoid people like the plague, wince at the thought of socializing, and couldn't care less for the things that used to motivate me.  I'm also in a totally new place after a relocation, so I'm alone most of the time.  That seems to be a blessing in disguise, as I am not in the business of spreading my dark cloud to others.

I wasn't going to at first, but I have decided to post here since time is kind of pressing for me at the moment. 

First, some background info:
After using kratom for about 9 months (approx. 15g/day), I finally decided to quit 5 days ago. Since then, it's been tough obviously - withdrawals-wise, but I have been trying my best at taking care of myself by moving around and nourishing myself properly. 

I acknowledge that this is all part of the process - RLS, insomnia, cold/hot waves, digestive issues, etc. However, I have been worried lately because I am going to be taking a flight on Sunday evening - so, 7 days since my last dose. 

I have been trying to manage the withdrawal symptoms by staying overall healthy and have been avoiding using any kind of meds (except some OTC meds, e.g. vit. C, Mg caps, melatonin). I have been debating on whether I should use loperamide at all - to help with digestive issues; more specifically, to stop diarrhea. I am not planning on using high doses or anything, just the recommended daily dose so I wouldn't incidently ""shit my pants"" while outside... 
I have some doubts regarding this medicine since I have read that it can actually worsen or prolong withdrawal symptoms. Moreover, it has apparently caused seizures in some. 

So, the main question is: would it be safe to use loperamide in small doses (recommended dose) throughout the day? And does the whole ""worsened/prolonged withdrawals"" propaganda only apply to people who use loperamide in high doses?

I guess what I am worried about is getting sick while at the airport or while on the plane. 

I could use just about any advice regarding this. 
So, I would be grateful if you guys could share your experience with using loperamide while in the midst of withdrawals. Has anyone noticed withdrawals getting worse somehow? Or being longer-lasting? This probably depends on lots of factors in one's life/manner of using; but still, I would really appreciate any advice on this matter. 
Thank you kindly =)",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47734308}"
