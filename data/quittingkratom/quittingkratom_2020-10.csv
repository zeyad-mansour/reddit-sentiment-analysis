On my 50th day cold turkey, I cycled 50+ miles . I felt so accomplished, despite starting to cramp up at about the 25 mi mark. That was last Monday and I spent the rest of the week with flu like body aches. It literally felt like WD . It was so weird . 4 days of that and I drank like 2 pedialytes, a sports drink and a smoothie and I felt 80 percent in 12 hours . I was dehydrated ! Lol if I was still taking kratom I would've just combated it with that. Smh. Just shows how much that trash can mess up our bodies. Fast forward to Sunday , I have a great workout and I'm back to my regular schedule- work, cycling, and jiu jitsu . Monday night, we were practicing collar chokes and I woke up Tuesday with a lump next to my jawline, under my ear. Now, I am sure it is probably nothing, but I am sitting in the ER tonight ridden with anxiety.

Just because we put down kratom doesn't mean life is going to be unicorns and rainbows all of the sudden. Life is still waiting for us to pick up where we left off when we get clean and sober . I've learned a lot from this subreddit and it has helped me so much when I felt like there was no hope. The biggest thing is has taught me you ask?

Started with capsules, then found a powdered extract (45% migragynine 1.3% 7-OH)

Was taking the equivalent of 70 GPD plus 3-4GPD Phenibut. Spending $1600/month. Led to panic, heart Palps, drives to ER parking lot, etc... 

Got here from zero in 5 months. Made the mistake of upping Phenibut to 8 GPD to ease withdrawals. Worst mistake of my life.

Days 0-14:
Acutes like hell, switching Phenibut to baclofen, and tapering that whole CT Kratom. Emotionless, thoughtless, hell on earth. Restarted my sobriety and 12 step program

Days 15-30:
Off Phenibut also. Frequent panic attacks, ahedonia, cravings, General unhappiness. No motivation, but forced myself to proceed with 12 step work, and of course going to work. 

Days 30-45:
Still feeling flat and emotionless. A few breakthrough moments of emotion, rare but present joy. Sleep has gotten better. Kava and melatonin helps with sleep and keeping anxiety at bay. Got back into light exercise, and for the first time felt like forward progress was being made. Slowly, but I got the feeling that I was “healing”. Still plagued with lack of endorphins and brain felt out of balance

Days 45-60:
Read up on DLPA (yes, phenylalanine is an amino acid that is part of a healthy diet). Supplementing DLPA made an immediate change. It’s supposed to be the precursor for your body to produce dopamine, and inhibits the breakdown of natural endorphins. I had to be exercising and generating them in the first place, but I felt an immediate benefit. By day 50-60, panic attacks were GONE. Felt sharp at work. Smiling again, flirting again, genuine conversations again. Still occasional cravings, but the feeling has come strongly that I’m MYSELF again. Still a lot of work to do, but for the longest time I feared my brain was irreparably damaged. 

Biggest helps:
-12-step program

-Exercise

-DLPA to restore endogenous neurotransmitters

-Forcing delayed gratification (you can veg out on YouTube ONLY after running a mile and lifting. Otherwise you’re cleaning the house)

I fully believe that Kratom is the ultimate “borrow some of tomorrow’s joy” chemical. We’ve got to consciously undo that pattern of thinking.

For everyone suffering with “will I ever get back to normal”, yes you will. I was convinced I wouldn’t. For me it took a full 50 days. We all think we’ve earned that after acutes, but it takes some time. I promise it happens.

I’m doing everything I can to stay out of “joy debt”. Do what has to be done each day, take the good times and the bad as they come. Life has both joy and pain. Borrowing joy leads to accumulated pain (withdrawals)

Seek out at least one way to be useful to someone else each day

Take a moment to be thankful for at least one thing each day

Force yourself to endure strain or pain before doing something enjoyable at least once each day

I am going to pick up some CBD tonight to help with sleep.  I also have four 600mg gabapentins I have from when I took them many years ago.  Any suggestions on moving forward?  Should I take big dose vitamin c?  So far only mild sweating, mild diarrhea, a little runny nose and eye watering.  Also just feel super lethargic.  Any advice or encouragement greatly appreciated.

I rationalize to myself that it is not necessary to quit since i function above baseline as a kratom user. I hold a high ranking position in a rapidly expanding company. I'm engaged to the girl of my dreams and we will be married in spring. I pay bills, bought a house, etc. Nobody is privvy to the fact i consumed 45 - 50 gpd aside from maybe the owner of the company (i havent told him but I'm sure he sees me mixing my ""nutrition shake"" every 4 hours on surveillance cameras)

I used the taper method successfully last year and stayed clean for 2 months before relapsing. I have tried tapering at least 5 times during the last 14 months unsuccessfully. The only thing that'll work at this point is CT.

Just gota sit thru the withdrawals and be done with it.

I spent the week tapering down as much as possible but if i prolong this any longer l will run down the same road as before and end up back on the shit full force.

Don't be fooled if you're a functional user. On the outside it may seem like we have it all together but the inside is just screaming for freedom. 

Being relatively sober all day, i got to appreciate the way grass looked on a median. A freaking median. This has no significance in anyones life but it was beautiful to me.

2020-10-30 17:42:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jl5wk2/all_the_lies_i_told/,All the lies I told...,"One of the top reasons I decided to quit kratom was because of all of the shame, guilt, lies, and hiding that went along with it for me.  I'm not yet ready to come clean to the people I lied to, though I plan to do it eventually after I'm in a better place with recovery.  But I need to start getting it off my chest.  So here it goes:

* Hid from my family that I used kratom at all.
* Hid from all of my friends how much kratom I used, or how often.
* Knowingly understated the risks and dependency potential of kratom when explaining it to friends.
* Asked a particular friend to take my kratom from me and only give it to me when I asked for it.  Bought more anyway without telling him.
* Woke up early to take kratom before my boyfriend was awake, so he wouldn't know I took it in the mornings.
* Took kratom when my boyfriend was in the shower so he wouldn't know.
* Took kratom while my boyfriend was playing video games or otherwise distracted so he wouldn't know.
* Lied to my boyfriend when he would ask if I'd already taken kratom that day, telling him I hadn't when in fact I had.
* Asked my boyfriend to hide the kratom in our apartment and only bring it out when I asked for it (out of sight, out of mind was the idea).  But I had secretly hidden a plastic bag of it in my clothes drawer so that I could still use it ""in an emergency"" if he wasn't around.  (Spoiler: it was always an emergency.)
* Ended up looking for it and finding it when he was away at work.  Didn't tell him about it, and used it when he was at work, being careful to put it back juuuuust the way I found it.  The paranoia about this was INTENSE.
* Ordered more kratom online without telling my boyfriend so that he wouldn't notice how quickly we were running out (and hence how much I was using).
* Lied to my THERAPIST, DOCTOR, and PYSCHIATRIST about how much kratom I used, how often, and other things I used it with.  Said I only used it on weekdays (false), only once a day (false), and never with alcohol (false).
* Lied to colleagues (and myself) about why I was so groggy, tired, etc. all the time and not getting anything done.
* Hid withdrawal symptoms from colleagues or explained them as something else.
* LIED TO MYSELF ABOUT ALL THE HARM ADDICTION WAS CAUSING TO MY JOB, MY RELATIONSHIPS, MY HEALTH, AND MY LIFE!

&#x200B;

Yeah, that's all I can think of right now.  I just had to put it out there.

I think that my reasons for lying and hiding were complicated.  Partly because I didn't want to admit things to MYSELF, partly because I didn't want to worry my friends and family, partly because I didn't want to face repercussions or be told that I should stop before I was ready.

I have been on it for four years for terrible chronic pain in several places. But I am so tired all the time. I have to take naps my head is foggy and I have no energy or stamina. I have to stop Kratom to rule it out because I have stopped everything else. I eat better than 99% of people now, I only drink water and veggie juice. I stopped all bad habits 2 years ago. I take no medications that alter my moods or body. I meditate, try to exercise but I am so tired and weak.  I must rule out Kratom as a cause. I want me back. I am now on 10gpd. I have been on that dose for many months.  I drink 3 liters of water a day. So I am super healthy now so I feel it is a good time to stop. IF after many months nothing changes I can always go back on Kratom for pain. I don't know how bad my pain will be after kratom.  I have been through major narcotic withdrawals many many times. I stopped narcotics 6 years ago but my pain became disabling so I found kratom 4 years ago after I had been off narcotics for almost 2 years.  So anyone everyone who can give me any advice on what to expect I would greatly appreciate it.  I don't think tapering works it never did with narcotics so I definitely want to go CT.  

Thanks in advance and God bless all of us trying to come clean. I sure hope most of you don't have to live in chronic pain after kratom. I will see how much pain I am left with after kratom.

Where I stand right now. Physically still tired. My energy by the afternoon is non existent. The hardest thing is my daily routine was before clocking out at work is dose 3.5 grams of white knowing it would stimulate me for an afternoon of doing whatever at the house. Then at 7 pm dosing 3.5 grams of red to relax. 

Gosh has it been difficult the last two weeks knowing this routine could maybe make my afternoons better. Work has been overwhelming and non stop from clock in to clock out. The anxiety of this thus correlates to my mood and habits lacking. The stress and lack of sleep has meant working out in the morning hasn't occurred in two weeks. 

I'm going to do my best to get back on that horse and force the working out. Thankfully I'm eating right. I've wanted to throw another MD day in but have not had the confidence / mood to commit to it and go to work. The Noopept lost its magic so I've taken a break. May give it another go on Monday.

The cold is here and the darkness at night is not helping. This is what I was worried about. Its engrained in me to not have any kratom till the holidays have passed though. I must see this through. Hoping by then the physical exhaustion has lifted.

Happy Friday All,

Beginning of day 15 from 40gpd habit (3 years of use). As I've mentioned in previous posts the acute symptoms were not as bad as I had planned them to be. They were no walk in the park to be sure - but they were manageable. It's early days for me but wanted to provide an outline of what I've experienced so far.

**Days 1-3**: Height of acute symptoms which for me included insomnia, RLS, extreme heaviness of body, chills and sneezing

**Days 4-6**: Anhedonia and several tears. I couldn't seem to feel much of anything but sadness. The one exception was music - I highly recommend making yourself a recovery playlist - it did wonders to keep up my motivation

**Days 7-9:** This seemed to be my very short lived ""pink cloud"" phase. Was nearly thinking I was on the other side - However I was cautious largely due to the amazing information this group provides.

**Day 10 -15:** Lack of motivation and anhedonia returns. I made the mistake of drinking a bit too much alcohol on day 12 which made day 13 one of the toughest days so far. The drinking seemed to help in the moment, but the comedown the next day was brutal. I've decided I need to take an indefinite hiatus from alcohol. One of my reasons for quitting was to be clear headed and drinking will not help me achieve that. The last two days have been markedly better I think in large part due to this decision.

SO here are my questions on antihistamines for anyone who may have some experience with it.

In my normal everyday life I have terrible allergies and usually double up and take BOTH Zyrtec and Flonase Daily. I have read the pains of RLS and antihistamines and have experienced it myself in previous quit attempts so I’ve avoided all antihistamines for the last 10 days. But let me tell you... this chick is suffering of allergy attacks on top of the sneezing that comes with the withdrawal symptoms. 

My questions are if the antihistamines that I take  would be fine because they are non-drowsy kinds?
It seems most of the warnings I’m reading on this sub have to do with NyQuil, ZzQuil, Benadryl yada yada... 
So is it just sleepy/drowsy meds to stay away from? Or all antihistamines? Anyone with any experience with this?

Double Digit Milestone & a little motivation for you.,"Cant get over that I’ve stuck through this misery for 10 days now. I truly feel that I’ve turned a MAJOR corner along this path of recovery. By no means am I out of the woods yet. And yes, I’m still very uncomfortable.. But, I’m accepting of this and embracing of this. What I AM incredibly grateful for is the regaining appetite. Slowly getting a few more hours of sleep during the evenings. Mood has lightened significantly. The full time anxiety and depression are breaking up into increments throughout the day. In the beginning, it felt like I was living in perpetual darkness. To see and feel light now is beyond powerful and giving me more strength to continue onward. Now, more than ever, I feel stronger and further pissed off with how I’ve let myself go. Completely gone. Previous quits, I’d always justify another dose. Just to feel it again. That consistent lie, you control this, go for it just once. For me.. this will Never. Happen. Again. 

There’s no other way to say this friends. This fucking sucks. Incredible amounts of suck. But we ARE resilient creatures. We do have the capability to pull ourselves out of these holes we’ve dug for ourselves. Kratom has a way of disassembling our being. Using for 5-6 years now, I am a completely different person than what I was before. I was creative, driven, fit, HAPPY, funny, a work horse, incredibly loving, etc. I’m now none of those things. None of them. What I am now is selfish and isolated. I’d rather sit alone, doing nothing, and eat stupid amounts of leaf capsules versus nutritious foods. 

Fucking serious?? This is the life I’d rather live? People don’t call or text anymore, lost my lover, lost a high paying job, currently about to lose my home, don’t want to see family. When I’m forced to see family, people pull me to the side and ask if I’m ok.. I’d always shrug it off and down play the situation. Even with multiple quits under my belt, I’d never take the time away from Kratom too seriously. Yet, it wasn’t as severe as before. Well, It took me all this time to put my foot down and say “absolutely never again”. This is NO way to exist on this planet. “Rock Bottom” is subjective from person to person, but I have reached mine. Reiterating myself, but I’m so done with this. We HAVE to hit life head on. Many of us have lost this ability along the Kratom path. We CAN and WILL relearn to thrive. Being under the influence of Kratom causes us to become masters of deferment. Deal with this later, deal with that next week, fuck, just don’t deal with it at all. I can’t do this anymore. 

Some of you are in the mud right now. Some are out of the painful acutes, but dealing with the mental games. STICK WITH THIS friends. Give yourselves time to heal. Set a goal for yourself and do not cave into our old ways of living. Give yourselves enough time to bask in that positive light that WILL shine through the darkness. Dosing again is not an option for many of us. Hell, if you’re cruising around here just reading, you’re likely in need of a change.

The time is now people. Not tomorrow. Not the next day.. Sound familiar? I’d tell myself this every single day. I’ll simply stop tomorrow.. Yeah.. another lie. Years went by promising myself this daily. 

Harness that strength in you. You may not feel strong right now, but it’s definitely within each of you. Trust me. It’s time to motivate and commit to yourself’s. It’s time to better your physical & mental wellbeing. To wallow through the pain and misery and come out the other side. Let’s live the life that we all deserve.

Started my journey by going out on the Appalachian Trail and destroying myself by pulling 20mi days for a little over a week. It was either that or go to rehab, so I chose the option that would be cheaper and suck more. It's kind of funny how the suck of withdrawals absolutely vanished between the constant movement, the smoky mountains in fall, the blisters on my feet, and the lack of anything to do aside from basic living (10/10 would recommend).

However, now I've got an issue. I'm still training for the high level sports that I compete in, but I've been eating everything in sight for the past five days. While a caloric deficit is definitely a probability from the hike, that's nothing new to me and it seems weird that I'm putting away 4000kcal a day when I'm only doing 2-3 hours of moderate intensity cycling. However, my metabolism is slow for my age (M23), so generally, weight maintenance with training is only like 2400-2600kcal. I wake up starving and can eat again within an hour of gorging myself. As a cyclist, I'm really freaking worried about weight gain. Does Kratom have a lot of fiber that expands your stomach or is my brain just dealing with feeling hungry after a year of hunger=dosing?

I went from 20-40, sometimes 50-60, grams per day to zero.  I had been using for about 3-4 months.  Prior to that was about 2 and a half years of cycling through abuse, withdrawals and recovery.  Only a handful of times have I made it this far.  Usually, I relapse in the first couple of weeks.

I feel much better than I did 2 weeks ago.  The 2nd week was the worst.  I am eating better, sleeping better and overall have better energy.  It’s not quite 100% but I’d say I’m around 75%.  That’s way up from the 10-20% I was feeling.  It just gets slightly better each day.

Sleeping is markedly better.  When I’m tired now, I actually fall asleep and stay asleep.  Initially, it was a struggle to fall asleep, and when I was lucky enough to actually fall asleep, I had horrible dreams and was maybe lucky to get an hour or 2.  The problem I have now is that I don’t get tired early enough.  So I end up going to bed late and only getting 4 hours.  I also will “nap” when I get home if I’m exhausted.  That can sometimes turn into 4-6 hours of sleep.  I wake up feeling great but have totally screwed up my sleeping habits.  I think by next week, I will fall back into normal.

My energy levels are great.  I only notice they’re affected when I take something to help me sleep.  So, if I take a unisom or something like that, it can cause me to be a little groggy in the AM.  However, it wears off eventually, but still sucks.  But, for the most part I don’t feel terribly exhausted all the time.  However, I do feel like it comes in waves.  There will be times where I just do not want to get out of bed and then other times where I’m a boundless ball of energy.  It feels so good to have all that energy again.

The “dullness” is wearing off.  For a while, I felt absolutely nothing.  I just felt super dull.  Nothing was interesting, funny, sad, happy, etc.  This week, I was driving home from work when I started feeling really good again.  It actually lasted for a while.  I’ve found time goes by so much faster now.  Initially, the days would just drag on.  Now, they’re flying by again.  Tomorrow is already Thursday!  I’ve been able to play video games, watch videos and all kinds of entertainment and find enjoyment in it.  

There are some minor improvements too.  Music sounds better again.  When I first quit kratom, I find the first day or 2 music sounds so good again, but after that... it kind of becomes annoying.  Mostly because you’re not getting anything from it.  Over the past few days, I’ve noticed I’m really getting into it again.  It makes me happy!  So I’m thrilled I’ve gained that pleasure back as well.

Everything has not been perfect though.  My stomach is still gnarly.  I will use the bathroom 2-4 times a day.  If I eat anything remotely spicy or full of flavor, it agitates my stomach.  It’s improving, but still an issue.  Based off what I’ve read, this could take a while to improve.

I’ve been a little lazy too.  When I get home, I will nap as I previously said or I will get comfortable and spend all night on the computer.  I do need to clean dishes and probably some mopping.  It’s not horrible, but not ideal. I was going to the gym regularly, but this week I stopped because I was trying to catch up on rest.  I’ve caught up, but need to get back in the gym.  Most likely I will be back tomorrow or Friday.  My strength has exponentially increased.  I was SO weak when I started.  Now I’m lifting much heavier!  I ideally would like to lose all the weight I gained during my addiction, which is quite a lot.

I’ve been a little too reliant on marijuana.  It’s been helping me sleep, entertain me, help eat, etc.  However, I notice it can affect my energy the next day if I smoke or dab too much.  If I spend all night dabbing, then the next day I’m just exhausted.  It usually takes lying in bed all morning, getting something to eat, lots of water and a hot shower to get me going.  Then, I usually need an energy drink or coffee to really get me back.  I have not smoked today, so we will see how it goes. 

Before I go, there are some other things I didn’t think about when I quit.  The money I’m saving has increased significantly.  I downloaded a quit app which generically asks you how much you were spending weekly on your addiction and the date you quit. It shows you how long it’s been and how much money you’ve saved.  This month it’s been $400 on kratom alone.  However, I’m saving even more than that.  I ate out a lot on kratom.  I also impulse bought a lot of things. One of my favorite things to do was go on Amazon while high.  I’m easily probably saving $1000 a month right now from quitting.

In the back of my mind, I do have worry.  I wonder if I will ever feel normal again.  I wonder if I will ever feel real good again without drugs.  I worry about the long term health impacts of abusing kratom.  Is my lover holding up?  How about the kidneys?  The chest and side pain I was having towards the end is completely gone.  But, I still worry.

Anyways, please don’t hesitate to ask questions or anything like that!  I love to help!

I started up kratom about 2.5 months ago after getting a herniated disc injury, and got up to maybe 12 g per day at the highest  due to the severe pain. The pain began to subside a month ago, and I tapered down to 2g/day before stopping it about a week ago. Starting yesterday, I noticed I had severe fatigue, which was worse today. I took my temperature and it was as high as 99.8 today, usually it is around 97. No cough. Having some anxiety which I have read can be a withdrawal symptom.

Does this sound consistent with kratom withdrawal? Would taking a 2g dose of kratom and seeing if the symptoms go away be a good way of testing if this withdrawal vs something else? I would feel better knowing it's not likely COVID.",3,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982938170433044}"

I've been lurking this sub for a few months now, and want to thank you for all the inspirational reading and advice. I'm a three-year user, with my consumption becoming much heavier over the past year. I took a business trip, could only get so much through customs, and junkied through it leaving myself nothing for the next few days. When I got back home, I'd lost the measuring spoon I'd used to manage my doses, and tore back into it with a vengeance. Now, a year later, I live in this grey half life where I have no interest in other activities, haven't had a good date in a year (compounding my misery and isolation) and dread further descent. I've told close friends about it, begun reading up, and begun planning to quit, although I haven't had the grit for it.

Beginning yesterday, however, I have had an absolutely miserable bout of food poisoning. I can't keep anything down, including the big ol spoonfuls of krat that I used to do. Acute food poisoning and withdrawals suck as bad as they sound. It got so bad that I took part of a small ration of suboxone a dear friend got me while I've been planning to quit, which made sleep possible but also locked me out of using krat for a day. 

So, my question to you experienced quitters is, do I take what was handed me? Or is it wiser to ride this out, then start a taper? My standard dose is between 5 and 7 half-tablespoon scoops a day (55-77 dry grams, I think?) so pretty high. On the one hand, I've already ridden out some of the w/ds, and in particular the hellish first day. I've also used up a little of my quitting supplies. 

On the other hand, I am not going into this with the mental preparation that most of you speak about, and I don't want to set myself up for failure. I also have some important opportunities over the next few days that I don't want to be writhing around for.

I relapsed in August, and since then I've been on and off of it (1 week on, 1 week off, acutes every other weekend haha pure hell).

So this relapse cycle for me was 3.5 months of 15-30gpd, with 30 days sober mixed in that 3.5 months.

I'm now day 12. The first 2 days off were shitty. I had really low mood, pretty extreme anxiety, some RLS. For the past week, it's been moderate anxiety, night sweats, and mild insomnia. 

Yesterday, after 945am, I felt normal and happy. Today too. Normal anxiety (low), no depression (normal).

What I'm wondering is, did I go through 11 days of mild acutes? Or did I only go through 2 days of acutes, and 9 days of PAWS? I'm trying to figure out if I'm truly turning the corner or if PAWS is gonna swoop in and floor me haha

Just search YouTube for ""wim hof method breathing"" and choose either of the first two videos. (Check out some of his interviews too.) It only takes 10 minutes to start.

I’ve been following this group and checking post occasionally because like everyone else, I NEED TO QUIT USING KRATOM! And I really feel the only way I’m going to do it is be held accountable and atleast share this experience to maybe help someone. Or maybe just help me.
I’ve been using 3-4 years now because it helped remove the desire to drink alcohol and curb my anxiety. And it worked , ive not drank in over 3 years. Like most things, everything is good in moderation. Kratom is a great plant with many uses but I abused it and here I am. I was a real jekyl and Hyde when I drank and you never knew what kind of animal I’d turn into once I took that first sip. And now the green slop has almost done the same thing.  However I have begun to realize what animal I am today and he’s unmotivated, angered and annoyed easily, lacks creativity, depressed, unloving and just wants left the hell alone because I feel like I’m stuck waiting for the next cup . 
Everyday I wake up I say “Today is the day Chad, But first let me have this first dose to get the day started,” and then you guys know how the rest of the day goes. 
It’s like every 2-3 hours now I mix myself up a little green cocktail and life is ok again and my mind is at ease.  
The RLS when I don’t dose is enough to make me want to chop my mother f€cking arms and legs off. I absolutely hate that feeling as much as I hate that I let myself become addicted to something again. Why didn’t someone warn me? Oh that’s right I wouldn’t have listened anyway. 
So here’s my question, do I just stop or taper? I feel like tapering will just lead me right back to waiting for my supply to run dry and then I’ll be waiting by the damn mailbox for the next shipment to come through and Just quitting will bring the tidal wave of symptoms that I’m dreading. You see the cycle here? LOL

What supplements do you guys recommend to give mysef a little bit of relief? CBD amd THC help?

End of day 8 CT,"Tonight at 9pm will roll me into day 9 CT. Still can’t get over what a ride this has been. I believe that I’m just now pulling through the acutes as the RSL is noticeably calmer. Appetite had improved on day 7 and I ate the world. Today back to nothing. Having to force myself to eat which is fine. Sleep is still non existent until last night. Stayed up all night Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Crashed hard Monday around 1 or 2am. Woke back up at 9:30 feeling like garbage and wanting to sleep another 10 hrs. Had to drive 3 hours north back to my spot. 

Days 2-6 were brutal physically and emotionally. It took every fiber of my being to not cave and “mediate” the severity of the above issues. I thought, in about 20-30 minutes I can eliminate all of this pain. Yet I interjected with another thought.. OR, I can continue on and slowly eliminate this toxic substance from my body and start working on living my best life. I decided upon the latter. I’ve committed myself and you need to as well. No excuses, no exceptions. I’ve set a target personal goal of 6 months and I WILL achieve this no matter what. 

Today, day 8, has been quite a mellow day. I’ve been tired as I have been awake for so many days on end. At some point your body just has to shut down, right? Maybe it will crash again this evening as it did briefly last night. Looking forward to that pink cloud phase coming. 2-4 days of a positive mindset and energy.. YES please. Yet it might not happen for a little while longer as I’ve been a long term/ heavy user. I’m NOT looking forward going into weeks of PAWS which I also feel will be prolonged with my usage length and amount. I’m expecting a lengthy experience for sure. 

Anyhow friends, please keep going! The first week/ 2 weeks absolutely BLOW.. but, you will start to get moments of relief.  These small windows are ones to glance through. What you feel and see will remind you what you will be like once you kick this stuff. It’s been imperative to meditate upon what & how I’m feeling during these positive, short/ fleeting moments. In time these windows will get longer and longer. Last time I had hit day 30-40 these moments were quite consistent and in length. But the cravings also come with a vengeance. So beware. 

Sending you all well wishes and strength at this time. For the new quitters, please don’t give up on your sobriety. I know how much pain you are in. Just make it another day..  and then another. 

For those who have some length behind them. Keep going. Don’t let those tricky lies make you think anything otherwise. No, you will not be able use this responsibly moving forward. No, you will likely not be able to do it just once. If you can commit, commit to NEVER again. Let your mind heal itself. Work on yourselves. Live the lives you deserve.

I believe someone like me who is addicted to kratom, have their own reasons.

I personally take kratom for my depression as a treatment . Previously I am an alcoholic after I stopped using kratom , drink every night quite heavily just to fulfill my myself. My boredom strikes every night. So I took something that hold me apart. But I only drink alcohol at night. 

I know it's not good, but kratom is better in the state of mind. Meaning I don't turned into violence or rage when I am drunk. It's stay out of trouble. 

But I don't say kratom is a good replacement for long term. It is not long term solution . for me the my addiction from kratom worse than alcohol because, i always have to take a sip everytime. Like 3-4 hours a dose. The reason I said because kratom share the similar to opiates like. Which pleased me into good mood like euphoria. 

If I drink alcohol like as much as i drink kratom routine, then its going to be serious problem . I am glad that i hooked into kratom for this addiction . 

I am trying to quit kratom . This time i want to stop at once . I know whats i am dealing with because i used to face the withdrawals and cold turkey . Its not easy . But i have to .

Went to a doctor. I am being diagnosed with depression and previously had a major depression disorder . Being prescribed zoloft by my psychiatrist which is anti depression.

2020-10-27 16:04:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jj8pdf/mslike_symptoms_started_before_quitting/,MS-like symptoms (started before quitting),"So I’m a kratom user at up to 25gpd for at least 2 yearsish. I have lifelong depression and anxiety. I was (consequently) an alcoholic for a few years, used krat to quit. Also smoked 10-20cigs per day for about 9 years up until 3 months ago. 

To make a long story slightly shorter, I’ve been having strange systemic symptoms since the beginning of the year. 

At first, it was insane tingling with any pressure on any limb almost instantly. To the point where going to sleep became hard sometimes because I was unable to find a position that didn’t cause an explosion of strange sensation in one body part or another. I did chalk this up to kratom and didn’t pay that much mind to it for months. Big mistake. 

Oddly enough, somewhere in this period a lot of  my symptoms had regressed a little and in that time I felt an (at least for a long time) unprecedented mental clarity while still taking kratom. I was still depressed and not in ideal control of myself and my life, but I was thinking more creatively, understanding deeper metaphorical, philosophical or allegorical meaning in things more intuitively, writing clearer and doing better at things like video games. 

The tingling began to come back, I had a CT scan for a probably unrelated issue and the arm which received the IV felt very numb for about a month up until the incident below. I should note that when I received the dye I felt a strong tingling in my fingertips on both hands and just chased it up to my bp being high from anxiety. 

Then one day in July, whilst walking to work I felt very off. My arms and feet felt heavy and my brain felt sluggish. At work I had to take a couple breaks because I was having trouble concentrating enough to do basic things and my hands felt numb. That night after running around  all night at work my feet were burning like I’d never felt before. Then, my gf of 3 years decided to talk about breaking up, which probably isn’t relevant but just an added detail of the abject shittiness my life has been the past few months lol. 

Over the next few days I felt a little better, then much worse and basically laid in bed unable to even comprehend Facebook posts without reading them like 5 times over. Then it cleared up a little bit again. It then kind of stabilized to “pretty bad but not completely horrendous” level of impairment and has remained. 

When these symptoms began I drastically cut my kratom usage but did not entirely quit. The symptoms began in July and I only quit ENTIRELY about a week ago. I’ve also quit smoking since August, and been taking vitamins, eating better (eating regularly at all that is) and trying to lift every other day. I’ve also started lexapro and therapy so at the LEAST I can say “this isn’t just symptoms of untreated depression/anxiety” as everyone wants to attribute this to in a knee-jerk fashion. 

I want to emphasize again that shortly before this I was successfully discussing and utilizing philosophy, politics, advanced music theory etc. then I was laid up in bed tingly and numb and practically unable to read or recall basic concepts I am familiar with. Something happened. I am almost certain kratom is a big part of the picture but it’s so damn obscure and complicated pharmacologically that it’s really hard to verify that and get proper treatment of symptoms. 

I’ve had a brain CT come back clear, lots of bloodwork which only really showed low vitD (supplementing now), seen neurologists, etc.

Had a brain MRI and found out the hard way that I am one of the 0.03% of the population who has an acute allergic reaction to gadolinium contrast dye. So I almost died and did not get the contrast portion of the MRI completed, but the normal portion looked ok aside from a maxillary mucus retention cyst.

I recently went to a much better neurologist whom my other neurologist referred me to, and at least was taken much more seriously. Most of their hands-on examination didn’t reveal any neurological deficits but they did find that I had reduced pain perception in a sock-and-glove distribution consistent with peripheral neuropathy of some kind. They ordered a more detailed EMG and a neuropsychiatric evaluation. 

I know there are some people who have had similar symptoms here between brain fog and neuropathy. But does it make sense that these symptoms started before quitting/didn’t really immediately respond to dropping dose or subsequent quitting? If so, will these symptoms ever fade? I’m so afraid my brain will never be as zappy and creative as it once was. Even my dreams feel simplistic, grey and mundane now in comparison to  the more abstract and mind-tickling dreams I have had my whole life. 

I’ve also started taking regular doses of BPC-157 and a little TB500 in the hopes of promoting general healing and neurogenesis. This seemed to produce a slight improvement right away but hasn’t “fixed” the issue. I suspect if that is possible, time will be the primary “medicine”.

I'm on day 12 and last night was the first time I slept through the night completely. I probably could have gotten there sooner but I'd been taking benadryl, allergy meds, and ibuprofen in the evening. I looked it up and read that these things can cause/worsen RLS. Since I haven't taken them it's been better. Physical withdrawals are almost gone ( except stomach issues). 

My problem is this is about when I have relapsed in the past. My anxiety worsens and once the physical pain of withdrawals is gone all I have to focus on is my anxiety. I'm also stuck with the fact that simply stopping this drug is not what is going to make me truly happy. 

I know that anxiety is part of the process of getting off this or any other drug. However, I feel scared because anxiety is why I started using in the first place. I'm really scared and I know that's not helping. What I'm holding on to now is: 
1. I don't want to have to withdraw from this drug again because it was hell. 
2. I know my anxiety is not that different from when I took kratom because it got to the point where it kratom didn't do anything for me.  
3. the biggest benefit of getting off this has been that I've been able to reach out to people I had been isolating from, I've been able to laugh, really laugh, almost every day at some point, and I've been able to be more of my silly self which has been gone for about 4 years.

 I know all these things are valid and real and I need to hold on to them but I'm still scared in this moment and so tempted to just give up. Any reassurance is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9675833582878113}"

I've observed that people that have taken this plant for less than a year generally have less severe PAWS for shorter duration. 

I am 22 days clean and I definitely have more crappy days than good days.  

I never really got bad acutes due to my long drawn out taper.  

My sleep has been improving but most of the time I am waking up too early or in the middle of the night.  I am thankful that I can get at least 6-7 hours of semi interrupted sleep.   This thankfully is not too much of an issue anymore.  

The worst part of this is the extreme lethargy.  It seems like I have destroyed my dopamine reward motivation system.  I am not motivated to do anything.  Most of the time and it takes extreme willpower to get myself to do anything.  Most days I feel that I had been lost in the woods for a week with no food and limited water and I am just trying to push through life duties and work after finding my way out.  

I forced myself to take a 4 mile walk the other day and I went to the gym to lift some weights.  I'm much weaker than I remember.  This did make me feel better.

The anhedonia is really depressing.  I used to fill my schedule with hobbies but I barely derive any pleasure from things I used to do anymore.  I just can't find a reason to bother doing anything.  I feel like I'm doing things because I have to not because I want to.  I think this also has to do with downregulaton of my dopamine system. 

So this is my experience, I'm wondering what you guys think and if it was similar for you too.  I'm especially curious to hear the opinions of those who took kratom regularly for years.  

Thanks for all your input.  Godbless.

I want to thank all of you who share your experiences as I have drawn strength from this community.

A little background, **I am a 20 year addict at 34 years old**. Typical start of daily MJ, alcohol and pills that progressed to a couple years on meth. Got semi clean in jail and maintained a form of sobriety for 4 years(no Meth) however this included regular drinking and MJ use. Ironically, I used fitness to 'run' from my real problems and it worked fairly well for a guy in his early 20's. About 8 years ago I let my guard down and hooked up with some friends doing perc's on the regular. At this time I was expanding a business, getting married and making some serious life decisions. This little party went on for about a year till one of the guys broke down and went to rehab. With my connection gone I began searching for something to fill my itch and 'luckily' found Kratom.

Kratom really can be a powerful tool. I quickly realized I preferred my 15-20 grams daily over any pills. It lasted longer, felt cleaner and seemed better. Unfortunately **I became the tool** in the relationship. Slowly my use increased and I began mixing other substances with Kratom always as my base. For the past 5 years I have been using between 2-3 KG per month(50-100g per day). From wake up till an hour or two before bed drinking that horrible greed sludge along with tobacco, alcohol and semi legal stimulants.... I have attempted a few times in the past to kick it but unfortunately I never really addressed the underlying addiction or provided a replacement. These attempts rarely lasted a few weeks and were always waiting for the final stressor to send me back. 

Recently my wife and I decided to start marriage counseling to work on 'Communications' as we have 3 very young kids, our business was getting hammered by gov't response to CV19 and I was high 24/7. .. Quickly our counselor who was an addiction specialist triaged our situation appropriately and we focused on my sobriety. I was ready but could never justify the time and resources I needed to actually do this but now was my chance. I am a HARD STOP kinda guy so I took a trip out to the forest and camped solo for two nights as 'reset'... MISERABLE!

**WITHDRAWAL** besides feeling like rotten dog poop and no drive for the first two weeks I experience significant **insomnia**. On initial CT I went 6 days (literally) with no more than an hour of sleep. Often zero. That is the hardest and weirdest part of the withdrawal and almost broke me. I tried to megadose melatonin(200+ mg) with no luck and refused to use official sleep aids. Today I am sleeping 6-8 hours a night, still broken with 3-4 wake-ups each night but I am definitely rested. One thing that has not quite normalized yet are my bowels... I think due to the insane quantity of fiber I was consuming? (*BTW I did find a melatonin on Amazon that knocked me out with only 20mg: Natrol Melatonin Advanced Sleep 10mg Time Release)*

My biggest advice to all my brothers and sisters is we **HAVE TO REPLACE** our addiction. My best days are very structured and focused on mental and physical health. 

* The WIM HOFF Power Breath mentioned in this forum is MONEY, and I try to start every day followed by 10 min of yoga to consider my day/life and 10-15 min of actual mediation. I used the apps Headspace and Waking up for Guided meditation but after 35 days and nearly 60 hours I dont always use an app. 
* I also **NEED** to train first thing, typically only 10-15 min of medium intensity running, rowing, biking, calisthenics. Keep it simple, we just need to move with a little intensity to get our brains working right. 
* Finally, and I could not do this for the first 15-20 days but am now, we have to structure our diets. Sugar is a drug and it will jack our brain up. I find my best days are when I eat 5-6 hours after waking, protein and fat focused, and my last meal 3-4 hours before bed. Basically 2-3 meals a day of unlimited plants and animals, no processed foods within a 6-8 hour window.

During my first 3 weeks I would meditate and train all through the day. When ever I was feeling the itch I would either find a quite corner (I have 3 kids under 3 years old...) or I would go outside to sweat and it was typically a perfect fix for a few hours. 

For the past 5 days I have woken up and felt better then I would ever feel after my first big does of that nasty green sludge on my poor empty stomach.

Because I have been so afraid of being in my own head for most of my life, these 35 days represent the start of at least a decade of complete sobriety. I have hesitation to commit to a lifetime at this point so for now I am committed to getting my kids to adulthood sober.

**A few other tools I have used along the way:**

Professional Counselor

Supportive Family

Melatonin, Magnesium, Cod Liver Oil, Vit C, Vit D, Probiotics and 5HTP

Homemade Bone Broth, Calf Liver, Kiefer and Yogurt (Whole and unflavored)

Tea- Matcha Green with Turmeric, Camomile 

Hiking, Weightlifting, Intermittent Fasting.

Reading Zen Buddism & Stoics

Guided meditation apps, creating a 'Zen' room to practice, write and train.

STRUCTURE YOUR DAY!!!

Out of fear. Quitting Kratom was just the very first step for my issues. I was on 3 drugs: Kratom, Dexamphetamine, Venlafaxine. At times it solved all my issues with BPD and I was myself again. But my months have been plagued with so much misery. I can’t describe just how low I feel, I feel terrible on the drugs, feel terrible due to BPD, and feel terrible in withdrawals. It’s a state of anxiety, depression, sickness, and somehow fatigue + insomnia. 

I cried because it all hit me tonight. I’ve made it so much harder for myself, I should’ve been honest with the doctors and told them how Venlafaxine made me feel awful, and how Dexamphetamine makes me feel extremely jittery, and both combined feels miserable. I’m going to call them tomorrow, I feel like I should stress that it’s urgent, I’ve spent the last few weeks actively suicidal and the only thing stopping me is guilt. I’m so so close that I don’t know if I’ll live out the week, I am terrified of withdrawals because I’ve been through them before and I couldn’t take it. 

There’s only one hope, that the doctors will understand, and help me switch ADHD medication immediately as well as gradually change my SNRI to an SSRI or maybe something else, I don’t know. I kept reading about other people’s situations, how do people find Dexamphetamine addictive?? It made me feel like I was doing something wrong for finding it so miserable, but maybe it just combines horrendously with Venlafaxine. I don’t know where I’m going with this, it’s 1:30am and I’m petrified. It’s not just withdrawals, it’s the emotional pain from depression and most of all the BPD and ADHD that will come rushing back. Thanks if anyone read this. I’ve got so many addictions and I just want to be free, but I’m struggling to make sure I will be alive to feel the freedom.

I’m happy to say that I am finally on the other side of this.
This is a post that summarizes my experience getting of kratom use and going through the withdrawal 

I have been a daily user for almost 11 months, I started lightly with the light doses of the kratom tea and my dose went up gradually until I started taking the capsules and that’s where it got pretty much out of hand! I couldn’t go through my days without feeling that buzz. And even if I did not take any; I would feel anxious just knowing that I don’t have any kratom in hand at any moment. I went up to about 35-45 gpd. 
One day I stumbled upon this subreddit and I read a couple of posts from people who tried to quit and people who are going through the withdrawals. And to be honest all it did was petrify me just thinking about quitting. 
I did some research and talked to some people from here and they were so great and Encouraged me. And I decided to jump off

The main thing that helped me was my mental preparation. I looked to it as a healing process for my body and soul that I will come off a better and stronger person and just knowing that helped me push through any cravings or pain. 


The process wasn’t as bad as I imagined it to be and I really believe that with the help of the supplements I was able to cruise through the days almost smoothly.

First I started with a pretty sharp tapper and I took down to about 10-12 gpd and the way I did it was by taking small doses of 3-4 grams every 5-6 hours, then I tried to slowly stretch the period between each dose until it I was able to take a small dose every 24 hours. 
I had some symptoms and although it was a little uncomfortable but it was manageable. At this point I wasn’t taking any supplements. I did some meditation and I exercised a lot which helped me so much. 
The last 3 days I jumped off to a very small, I was having some kratom cookies that contain 3-4 gm each. I took one a day.

First days going completely without any kratom .

A lot of people are talking about vitamin c and I can’t emphasis enough on how much it took care of almost 90% of the physical symptoms.
For the first 8 days I had a cold like symptoms( sneezing, runny and clogged nose) and felt my body temp increasing at times. And that’s where I started mega dosing vit c. I took 3-4 g of liposomal vitamin c every 4 hours. It took care of the physical symptoms and it was extremely helpful.
I took magnisium  , l-theanine, dlpa and black seed oil. All these supplements took care of any minor anxiety I was starting to feel. 

The only symptoms that I have issues with was rls and insomnia but I was able to deal with it with two things that I did not see any posts talking about:
The first thing was a breathing technique called the “wim hof method “ it was super helpful and it is easy to perform.
The second thing was binaural beats. There are plenty of them on YouTube and are designed to help with rls and insomnia , there are even some that are designed to give a relief from opiate withdrawals. 
For the first 8 days I was struggling with my sleep because of the restlessness but with the help of the binaural beats I was still able to get about 6 hours of sleep every night.
I am on day 11 today and the physical symptoms are pretty much gone but I am still taking 2 gm of vit c a little bit of the other supplements. 
My sleep is almost back to normal but I am still doing the breathing technique since I was already doing for a long time and it’s very helpful.

I apologize again for the long post but it is something that I really wish I had before going on this journey and I hope that is going to be helpful for someone who’s about to go through it.

At the end I would like to say thank you to everyone who supported me along and would like to say that you can do it no matter how many times you try and fail and no matter how afraid you are to start, and message me if you have any questions or need any support.

2020-10-25 14:18:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jhy4y5/quitting/,Quitting,"Hi Everyone,

Not exactly sure what to expect from doing this but I had to do something. Without going into all of the gory details, I have had a kratom addiction issue for approximately 2-years. During this 2-years, it was more often than not a daily habit. The only time where I came close to quitting was a trip to Brazil with my girlfriend - Kratom is not legal there which I didn't know prior to going and the little bit that I brought with me didn't last more than a few days. As such, it was an involuntary cold turkey period and I experienced every withdrawal symptom on the list...it was awful to say the least but by the end of the trip I felt ok (we were there for about 3-weeks). However, I immediately went out and bought kratom when we got home and fell right back into the habit. That is not the worst part though...

As a direct result of kratom, I have had approximately 10 seizures over the past few years (that I know of). At first I wasn't sure kratom was the cause, but even after I was able to connect the dots (along with a neurologist) I continued to take it. I've had trouble with alcohol in the past so addiction is not new for me. Through AA, I was able to rely on my sponsor, fellow AAs, and my higher power to get through it. Now I think i'm ready to get off kratom, but I CANNOT go through what I did for alcohol. My friends, girlfriend, and family stuck with me through alcohol and are all so proud of me (even though I always tell them it wasn't me, it was the program). If I were to tell them about this, it would break their heart. My girlfriend is aware of my kratom addiction and is ready to leave me but is giving me one last chance...my family and other friends are not aware and I CANNOT tell them.

I guess I just wanted to write this in the hopes of getting some advice and things to help with kratom withdrawal. But I am also looking for some hope and encouragement from people that have been through what i'm going through and made it out on the other side. I am feeling very lost/down right now but I know with all my heard that I need to stop for my loved ones and for myself as it's literally killing me (just as alcohol was doing).

If anyone has any thoughts on anything I've said, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks all, and good luck to everyone else who is going through the same situation.

I’m on Day 21 CT. I was formerly anywhere from a 20-60 gpd user, so I kinda got up there. It does get better. Gabapentin certainly helped me in a pinch. But however you decide to quit, it is a good thing. Letting anything control your life is a horrible way to live. I had medical problems (had a seizure, so that was fun) and horrible anxiety (panic attacks so bad I couldn’t keep up with class) thanks to kratom, so I got sent home from college because of it. I had to withdraw from the whole semester to get a fucking grip on my life. I am so happy I did. My girlfriend came to visit me at home this weekend, so I am lying next to her in bed right now, and everything feels like it’s gonna be okay. Life will get easier and easier without kratom. Your breath won’t stink anymore, you won’t need that green sludge just as badly as oxygen, you’ll be able to focus on your personal goals, be able focus on your work/social life, you’ll have a sex drive again, and so many more rewards for you kicking this demon out of your life once you get to the other side. In the beginning, it will really suck sometimes. I am very, very lucky to have a great support network of people professionally and personally, and it helped so much. My best advice when you’re feeling shitty at the beginning of your healing process is to reach out to someone you know well or love and just talk about literally anything, and your heart will be so much more full. Even when you feel completely healed from this horrible disease which is kratom addiction, keep doing that. Keep filling your heart, with your passions, with people you love, with good deeds. You were trying to feed your soul with kratom, but the key to doing that is already inside you. Just spread your love, cut yourself some slack, and do what you know will make you happy in the long term. I believe in every single one of you, no matter your circumstances, it will get better one day. I promise.",45,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.982406497001648}"

The last few weeks have been HORRIBLE. Could barely get out of bed before noon, couldn‘t walk the stairs anymore, no efficiency or productivity whatsoever. I kind of had a hunch this may have been due to Kratom. So after a few days of tapering down, 15 days ago I dared the jump and didn‘t take any of that stuff anymore. 

First few days were interesting. Restless legs, oh yeah - never knew how it felt. Bad sleep? Check. Weird thoughts and feelings - double check. Now, 15 days later, I‘ve got a lot more energy, but still struggling a bit along the way. Let‘s say I had 60% when starting to use Kratom, I was down to 5%, and now back to 30%. Getting up again in the mornings, work out works out, I feel like I‘m turning human again.

And, even though I know that time will probably heal the remaining wounds, I‘d like to reach out and would love to ask what natural supplements helped you along the way. Right now, I take a mix of various aminoacids, Black See Oil, Agmatine and Vitamin B (combi + B12) / C. Anything you can think of that really helped you along the way? Or just stick to the routine, work out, catch some good  ZZZs whenever possible + fresh air.

All in all: If you‘re considering kicking the habit right now ... go for it. This were the worst few months of my live ... even though Kratom didn‘t do too much for me, it made me dependent, weak in will and flesh, and turned me into a completely different person. If I had known any of this before starting using (which is entirely my own fault, didn‘t do my due diligence and just kept sucked in by the raving reviews and posts on the main sub), I would have kept my fingers away from this devilish substance. It‘s just plain vile, disgusting and turned me into a Zombie. So glad I decided to go CT - and, guess what, the first two weeks were absolutely doable (in comparison to waking up each day in withdrawal and spending my days in Zombie mode).",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.995863676071167}"

I had some CT quit time just a few weeks back. I remember day 5 very well and it was another brutal day to say the least. A part of me was hoping that the previous clean time might make this go a little bit easier. This is not the case in the slightest. If anything, it’s a little bit stronger/ more difficult than the previous attempt. The anger and rage came on with a vengeance for sure. It took over by storm yesterday afternoon which was incredibly frightening. So out of character as I’m an incredibly mellow, laid back individual. I guess one can look at this as a good sign. Feelings and emotions are returning. Regardless of how they appear. 

This community has been a huge crutch during these painful days/ nights. I’ve been scrolling through religiously, spending probably too much time on here. Reading and re-reading. Listening to each of your own experiences is most helpful and inspiring to keep pushing forward.

I'm not sold on Kratom behind totally evil or anything like that. What I am certain of is that Kratom is a drug that can be abused and that abuse can lead to myriad problems.

The tapering guide here is super important. I suspect that if more people followed a taper that incorporated a new habit, specifically exercise, that the pain of WD would be significantly reduced. 

Getting off SSRIs AKA antidepressants, requires monitored tapering. I believe Kratom works at many of the same sites.

I have no idea whether relapse is more likely via CT or progressive taper, but I think less suffering is better and helps to reduce relapse.

was doing 2 -3 doses a day.. i did some shrooms / acid and had a revelation.. i need to get off kratom ... i need to be able to wake up and not need anything...

so i decided to quit... i was doing 15-20 grams a day @ 5 grams - 7 gram doses and 3 doses a day

then i decided to do 5 grams only 2 times a day so thats a 10 gram drop about...

i noticed overlapping withdrawals because of doing 2 doses and not 3 , by waking up taking 5 grams, and waiting till 7-8 pm at night for the last dose, somewhere in the middle there was slight withdrawal but nothing too bad

well i just stuck with 2, 5 gram doses a day and eventually there was no withdrawls in the middle of the day

took a week for the 2 doses of 5 grams  (10 g a day) and no withdrawals..so then i began to taper

at first i went too low i went to 3.5 g in morning, and i felt withdrawals, so i did 4.5 and that worked..

so i did 4.5 in morning 4.5 in the pm thats 9g now

3 days later i dropped to 4g, did that for couple days then went to 3.5

i stuck with the dose of 3.5 for another couple days then dropped to 3 grams

eventually i was down to 2, 3 gram doses a day... about 3 weeks in... went from 15-20g and now im at 6g and im happy im making progress.. (also my kratom tolerance is lowering and these 3 gram doses are really getting me stimulated and feeling good..

&#x200B;

then i decided to just do 1 dose a day... just 3 grams in morning, get what i need to get done and i feel crappy during the last half of the day because no more second dose... i did this for like a week and eventually you dont even need the second dose... You wont feel any withdrawals at all..

ater like 3-4 days on 3 grams once in morning i tapered again and took 2.5g in the morning for 3-4 days

then 2 grams for 3-4 days then 1.5 grams, then 1 gram ...

&#x200B;

today is my 2nd day with no kratom at all.

i tried quitting cold turkey and its horrible... no way i could do it...

also if i had to work or take care of kids or any responsibilities i wouldn't be able to have tapered  (unless i did it .1 gram at a time)

&#x200B;

tapering is allot more easier and even though i felt milder withdrawal symptoms here and there its not like cold turkey..

&#x200B;

you just need to figure out how much to taper down to, and how many doses to take... id say 3 doses a day should be good enough... just taper slow... .5 grams every 3-4 days... eventually try to do only 2 doses a day... but if you cant just stick to 3 doses a day..

&#x200B;

even if you taper .1 gram a day and it takes 1-2 months (if you need to work and stuff) you can still do it!!!

&#x200B;

also smoking cbd flower helped with headaches / discomfort ...and i used imodium to help with stomach issues

&#x200B;

EDIT: also use a scale! i used capsules weighing .1 gram each, i would capsule up allot and weigh them out to be precise. every .1 of a gram matters and to taper like i did i had to be precise up to .1 gram. you can even use a scale that does .00 and be even more precise. example some scales only weigh up to .0 some .00 some .000 which is more precise but any scale that goes to .0 is good.

&#x200B;

i wish i could detail my experience better and write it out better but hope this helps

&#x200B;

EDIT: if you want to taper and not feel hardly any discomfort / withdrawal you can always taper at  .1 gram, every other day or even .1 gram every 3 days, or even .1 gram every week. it will be slow and might take months to a year but if you are taking allot and you really cant afford to feel slightly crappy you can always taper slow and little by little..

2020-10-24 11:37:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jhayz4/alcohol_and_kratom/,Alcohol and Kratom,"I’ve been hanging out in this forum for a couple of weeks and am finally realizing that kratom is to blame for the reason I have not been myself for at least two years. When I began using I didn’t know how addictive it could be, and I know I have to quit. I don’t have a good grasp on how much I was taking, because I thought it was pretty much harmless, I will mindlessly take 2-4 teaspoons whenever I felt like it. I’ve been dozing as usually to see how much I take on an average day, and I think I’ve been taking about 50gpd, sometimes more, sometimes less.

I overcame a heroin addiction 17 years ago and can’t believe I’ve gotten myself addicted again, and withdrawals to go through. At least with heroin the withdrawal period is only 5 days. I’m freaked out about how long kratom withdrawal symptoms can linger on from what I’ve learned from this forum, and I want to quit in a way that is the least uncomfortable so I can stick with it and be done with it. I’m a wife and a mother, and my pre-teen is struggling with depression and anxiety, so I have to be present and functional so I can take care of her mental health especially.

I cut back considerably on my alcohol intake recently ( from a bottle of wine a night to a few drinks a couple times a week) and really can’t decide how much alcohol, if any, I should allow myself to have, just being mindful about it. Sorry for the long post. I’m finally getting to my main question: how does alcohol affect the kratom withdrawal process? Last night I took a moderate amount (moderate for me, about 11gpd) and felt great late afternoon. I decided I would have some wine, and it made me depressed almost immediately. But I continued to drink my wine, and I got tired. I even got some chills. I’ve never noticed that kratom and alcohol don’t mix, but yesterday was different because I was intentionally trying not to dose kratom later in the day. I’ve noticed I have an easier time waking in the morning if I don’t take kratom late afternoon/evening.

Does alcohol make kratom withdrawal worse? Should I not drink any alcohol while tapering kratom? I do miss my wine, and it takes some work for me to abstain completely, so if quitting both at the same time is too much I don’t want to set myself up for failure. But if alcohol effects me like it did yesterday, or anytime I am taking less kratom, then I probably won’t want it anyway. How does alcohol affect you when using kratom as opposed to trying to quit kratom? Also, does kratom make it hard to wake up in the morning and how do you combat the extreme sleepiness?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981853365898132}"

Still feel insanely achy, sweaty and chilly, beyond heavy, absolutely no energy, no appetite, etc. I feel that the anger is making this so much worse. I honestly can’t shake the mindset today and it’s just causing me to dwell on the situation.  Minutes roll over like they’re hours. 

It’s also aggravating that I can’t focus on anything, regardless with how hard I try. Thinking that I have weeks of this ahead of me is daunting. With the amount of time that I used & the amount, I’m in for a ride. 

Regardless, it’s almost the end of another day. Not pumped to toss and turn again tonight. But.. here’s to hoping tomorrow will be a tiny bit.. even a small fraction of a bit better than today. 

Here’s to sticking through this friends. Regardless of how shitty this situation is.. no Kratom was consumed today. That’s a win.

So I wanted to be off at this point, but I'm going to just keep cutting 10 to 20% weekly until I'm down to .250 mg a day.

Thanks for any input or suggestions. I feel very happy to be down to 2 gpd after two months of tapering. 

As seen, I had some slip ups after getting cut down, but these larger dose days took away the nagging symptoms and I just didn't beat my self up like in the past and just dropped back down and was able to manage better after that.

The odds are stacked against me as it is, I’ve been on hormone therapy called Orillisa for my endometriosis it’s got me in induced menopause and I must have missed a couple days (obviously) but I had taken my dose as even the day I found out I was pregnant. I’m also epileptic and haven’t been taking folic acid (I am now) which the medicine depletes all the folic acid from my body which can cause birth defects, so The odds are stacked. Anyways, I’ve been taking kratom over a year daily. I take probably maybe 10 grams a day usually a gram or 2 every 4-6 hours probably. I’ve never measured it but if using a regular spoon, I’m usually just covering the tip of the spoon so I’d say a gram but I’m worried because I’ve seen how it feels when I go all day without, I’m dizzy, shaky, sweaty, and that’s just if I don’t have it by the end of the day, so I can’t imagine what it’ll be like to completely withdrawal. Can someone tell me how you ended up doing? I have to do this carefully due to be pregnant. (First time so new that whole world now too) so I can’t take certain medicines or smoke weed which I would try any other time to help. But I’m at a loss, and my fiancé doesn’t know that I take it as much as I do let alone that I HAVE to have it or I’m withdrawing, he doesn’t know much about it. But I’m worried he wouldn’t understand much, so I feel a little alone. I just want to be off this crap forever and no one knows effects it’s has on a baby and I don’t want to find out. I’m afraid to talk to my dr for fear of judgment, and don’t want dcs in the picture because of it if I am able to carry it. I’ve got a small chance due to my epilepsy medicine and other condition but I want to give it all I’ve got to save it, so Idk if I should do it cold turkey? Would it hurt the baby? Tapering off? Will it take too much time and cause birth defects or brain problems?  I’ve never been addicted to any drug or anything in my life. My boss (a dentist) is who originally mentioned kratom (he’s never tried it but read studies) and he knew about endometriosis (female reproductive disease) and struggle with pain and kinda thought it’s a win win, it’s not an opiate and it’s natural- GREAT!  and then.....boom next thing I know I’m addicted (no body knows) I don’t want anyone knowing that. Not that I’ve ever judged an addict and have a soft place in my heart for them long before my battle with kratom, but I’ve never really taken pain meds in fear of addiction and my family is very nose up in the air if you will, and wouldn’t understand. Also never went down that hole because I have so many friends and loved ones struggle and some who lost their battle so I thought hmmm this is safe and natural and on addicting and boy was I wrong. But now I’m in a pickle due to the pregnancy. Again only 5 weeks atleast. just need advice all the way around, what do I do, where do I begin, how, when? Like I’m at a total loss. I never expected to get pregnant atleast, miracles do happen so I want the baby to have the same chance as anyone else. But I’m alone and scared and just lost now. My hormones are raging right now and don’t understand that at all-THATS A WHOLE OTHER load of questions lol I’m sorry for the long message and I understand if no one replies.

I'm on day seven of going cold turkey. I can't say exactly how much I was using per day. It was something that varied anywhere between 4 to 10 heaping teaspoons to 4-6 heaping tablespoons a day for over 3 years. Basically I got to the point where I rarely got what I was looking for from kratom, which was to ease my anxiety, depression, boredom, and, well, basically existential fear. 

I've tried to quit at least three times before and have made it about a week to 10 days at the longest. However, it feels different this time, and I think that is because of all of you. Every single one of you who has posted to remind me that I am worth the struggle, that the ""relief"" kratom brings is just a lie. An unsustainable lie.

The other thing that is kept me going is realizing that my anxiety was there even when I was taking kratom. In fact I think it was worse. I started taking kratom to avoid all of my feelings and my grief. But all my feelings and grief have just built and been waiting for me. They've been coming up through the sludge of kratom. This process has taught me to embrace my feelings because when I do, they make me stronger. During this week long journey, I have laughed harder and more often than I have in months while using kratom. I feel like I'm finally 'in' my life, if that makes sense.

This doesn't mean I haven't wanted to use. boredom is a huge trigger for me. I want to be bigger better than what I am and it's so tempting to just give up. But then I come back here and read about all the people who have been able to overcome these short, fleeting desires. And, that helps me stay strong. I will never be able to repay all of you for, basically, saving my life. Or rather, giving me my life back.

Thank you all and keep it up.",8,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.955725371837616}"

Maybe I just need a push...,"So this is about my 8th time quitting this crap. I've been using since 2016. At my highest I was a 50gpd user. This summer, when I went back to it after a full year completely clean (thank you, COVID), I was at about 30gpd. 

  
 I CTd twice and went back after a few weeks both times. With each withdrawal, I swore never again. Yet, back to the tobacco shop I went a few weeks later to try and quell the constant anxiety and sense of impending doom my brain kept pushing into my awareness.   


This time, I was trying to taper, which I had never done before. Never had the will power. I have a taper buddy who's a veteran so she was helping me along. I was doing ok I thought. I had gotten myself down to 15gpd. But  then yesterday as I was taking my last dose of the day way way earlier than I should have been, something snapped in me, and I was so disgusted with myself, with the sludge, with constantly thinking about my next dose, with dosing my last dose early and knowing I would obsess about the the rest of the day, and I just said -- screw it. And I haven't dosed since, and that was yesterday, just shy of 24 hours ago at this point. I know the pain is coming - I can feel it ramping up, starting to course through my muscles, bones, my brain. The chills are there. The extreme sensitivity to the rush of cool air when the air conditioner kicks on. The nausea. And I have a full bag of K sitting in the cupboard that was just waiting for me to weigh out my daily dose. 

Every day for the last 6 months, I chased that crap like I needed it - and I am just beyond frustrated, disgusted, sad and disappointed in myself.

So...I think I'm going to jump. I think I'm ready to just take the pain of the next few days and be done with it. As I sit and type this, my feet are ice cubes. My neck is wet with sweat. My back is aching. My stomach is churning. And I know this is only the beginning. But even with all of this and what's about to come... I just cannot bring myself to go to that cupboard and mix a dose...

I really am grateful for places like this as I don't personally know anyone who has quit kratom, the only person I know that used was the person that introduced me to kratom. summary of my story is that I was in a car accident leaving me with 6 herniated disks, 3 in my neck and 3 in my back.
   I was on oxycodone 30's for about 5 years until my tolerance got so high my entire script for the month  would be gone in 5 days. I quit oxycodone cold turkey and much to my shock had no withdrawl, I did end up with what appears to be permanent stomach problems that persisted for 3 years after I stopped the pain pills. In that 3 years I got used to the pain and was able to somewhat function normally with the exception of the pain being very de-motivating. 
  A coworker introduced me to kratom and I was skeptical but tried it and it got rid of the constant ache in my back and helped with my stomach problem(which was nearly incapacitating in some instances). I did some research on if it was addicting because it was too good to be true and got mixed results through Google (wish I had looked here first), most of them saying it wasn't addictive. I figured even if it was addictive I'd be able to kick it no problem since I had no withdrawl from oxycodone ( hard to believe i know). Fast forward 3 years and what started out as 1 teaspoon twice a day has turned into 6-8 tablespoons a day (not sure how many grams exactly because I've never weighed). 
   So here I am ready to drop this shit, I've never let anything take control of my life like this and nearly terrified of the withdrawl. If I'm having withdrawl like this while still using I can't imagine what it will be like when I quit. I have most definitely decided to quit but not sure what approach to take. I considered tapering but already know I'm terrible at that, I considered suboxone because there's a doctor within 5 min of my house but I know I'll just end up addicted to that. Cold turkey would be my next option but I can't imagine having to go work an 11 hour shift while withdrawing and being a restaurant manager 2 weeks vacation isn't an option at the moment and I want to quit now.

* I've heard people say it on here ""Embrace the Suck"". Rather than fighting the sadness and physical symptoms I've tried to just embrace what I'm going through.  When I have moments where I'm feeling down I try to just accept it and remind myself my brain is healing itself and this is temporary.

At first I didn't open my eyes. I tried to go back to sleep. Then I realized I couldn't. The reason was because it almost felt as if my whole body was spazzing. Not even joking, every 1-10 seconds I'd aggressively switch positions, no matter how many pillows or blankets, I can't lay still for longer than 10 seconds. This causes me to straight up rage and get so mad I throw my pillows and blanket and fucking stomp out of bed only to realize I can't even stomp properly cuz my legs are shaking. On top of that, lots of cold sweats when sleeping. When I finally got out of bed, my back/neck pain, shaking legs, and upper body spasms forced me to dose again. It was so severe I couldn't even sleep the pain off so now I'm going to stop cold turkey and try to taper.

I switched to Kratom back in August this year when getting off Suboxone, and am now down to between 4 - 3.5 grams of kratom total per day.

The reason I am posting is that I find I feel like shit multiple times a day (usually leading up to my next dose), and my sleep has been just horrible. I've been crashing at only 9:30PM each day, waking up for an hour around 1:30AM, and then having fractured sleep the rest of the night.

This is after leveling out at a dose for a week or so... I would have thought the sleep thing would imrove as I got used to the stupid stuff.

For reference, my current dosing schedule is 1.5G in the morning, then 1.2G right before lunch, and lastly 0.8G as late as I can wait.

Please help. The poor sleep is killing me, and is one of the bigger factors in potentially taking too much K during my taper... Is there a better dosing schedule that would improve my sleep? Any other ideas? Supplements? etc.

**Just an Update:** 

I've since managed to deal with the sleep thing much better by spacing 4 identical doses out throughout the day at 4 hour intervals. It works out like this:

6:30AM: 1G

10:30AM: 1G

2:30PM: 1G

6:30PM: 1G

I eneded up going back up to 5 grams, and now I'm back down to 4 total, and sleeping better (also the steady blood level of alkaloids throughout the day is much better). 

On the odd occasion that I do get woken up, I've found that rolling over and taking a big drag of an Cannabis Indica vape pen (I'm in Canada - legal) is the only thing that gets me back to sleep.

I've also found that I tend to sleep through the entire night soundly if I take a medium dose of cannabis oil before bed - which I suppose lasts long enough that I just stay asleep.

I realize some believe it isn’t a “hard drug,” but after using anywhere from 50-80 grams a day for nearly 3.5-4 years with some failed quit attempts and very brief sober periods, my body has seriously become dependent on it, and yes, in my case, my withdrawals are extreme, even when tapering.

I thought quarantine would be a good opportunity to quit, however, I felt the constant boredom triggered my desire to use even more. Most recently, I was taking 120 capsules a day, equivalent to 72 grams daily (0.6 grams in a capsule). 

Lately, I’ve developed heart palpitations that are very consistent, and keep me awake. I will feel the “flip-flop” feeling sometimes several times a minutes for hours. I can not decipher if this is caused by the Kratom, or is a withdrawal effect, as the palpitations have been going on and off many weeks now (even while I used at my normal dose, but would seem to be less noticeable) and as a result, I have some tests scheduled for Friday, to include an echocardiogram.

I am hoping my age is on my side. I am 29, but quite honestly, I am fearing the worst. It seems I may have developed a heart arrhythmia, and it has me incredibly anxious.

A few weeks ago, I started a taper from 120 capsules, to now, 30 capsules a day, and feeling ‘okay.’ I even made it through work today, sober. This was the first time in a very long time. It took a lot, but I did not take my first dose of 10 capsules until 16:30, when I usually would have had 80 capsules by then.

I’ve made the decision to quit tomorrow. I still have doses lined up through next week, but these palpitations have honestly scared me to the point of just wanting to get off. I cannot even sleep right now, as they are exacerbated when lying down.

Please know that this drug is certainly dangerous, and if you are thinking about quitting, act now (either through therapy, a taper plan, cold turkey, etc.).

The reason I have failed to quit is that I have mental health issues, and have used Kratom as a coping mechanism. I’ve finally decided to find a therapist, get some of this resolved, and learn better coping mechanisms.

I apologize for the long, disorganized post. I guess I just wanted to just reach out to some of my fellow Kratom Quitters to serve as an example of what may happen if you stay on Kratom long enough, and encourage you to really push forward and quit. 

I am also reaching out for some support and encouragement. I am hoping I can both physically and mentally recover, finally get married to my wonderful fiancé while sober, and have plenty of kids. Recently, I realized that is all I have ever wanted in life. 

I sure hope it isn’t too late, and the news I receive Friday isn’t too bad.

Thank you for reading, and please wish me luck. Fight this fight with me. 

Take one day at a time, and work to make progress each day, even if it is minuscule. Going from 120 to 30 capsules for me was a tedious process, but it can be done. For once, tapering actually worked for me because I was and I am genuinely committed to getting sober. Now it’s time to let go. I’ll do anything and everything it takes.

However I’m trying to decide if I should try this combo while I taper or wait until I go CT?

Essentially I plan on taking 500mg of L-tyrosine first thing in the morning on an empty stomach before my morning dose of Kratom and then 50mg (more If needed) of 5-HTP at night around 7pm, two hours after my evening dose of Kratom. 

I’ve seen a few people say the combination of 5-HTP with Kratom made them sick. 

Also I’ve heard that L-tyrosine can potentiate my dose of Kratom... I’m really wanting to avoid this as I’m trying to quit and don’t want to feel the effects of Kratom, just want to take enough to keep WD at bay.

But long story short:

9 years ago, i was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. I was prescribed 200mg of oxycodone and oxycontin a day. The withdrawal was horrific when i decided enough was enough. (I stayed high-high 24/7 during my 3 years of chemo/surgeries. Legally). 

Fast forward to 2017. Cancer free. However, after multiple surgeries, my bowels are always liquid. 20 times a day, without opiates. 

Lope helps but still loose and gross. 

Kratom. I found kratom in 2017. 

3 years later, i find myself still taking 80+ 1/2 gram capsules of kratom a day. 

No liquid stools. Full solid poops twice a day. 

However, emotionless. Like a walking zombie. I remember before kratom, I would get lil excitement highs from the little things, like sunsets, cute girls, accomplishments. No, not anymore. I was quiet on kratom around people. Awkward. That talkative high was gone long ago. 

Autumn 2020, i have acquired my dream welding job, and also started and run my own business on the weekends. All on kratom. Kratom, I thought, motivated me. Everything in my life is going perfect, expept my feelings. 

Today is day 6 no kratom. 

Took 11 days off work for vacation. 

Day 6 no kratom, but starting on my second day in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee on my 5 day vacation down here. 

With my new girlfriend, my dream gf. Fully supporting me. 

Oh, and i quite nicotine the same day I quit kratom. Smoked, vaped and chewed, everyday for years. 

Wana know how I feel? Guess. 

But better than what you or me thought. 

Somehow, other than extreme fatigue and cold/hot flashes, everything is great. 

No vitamins. 

Just a lot of whiskey at night. Like after 3pm:)

Never going back to kratom or any other drug. Alcohol will be cut back for the next week. It takes away the coldness of kratom withdrawal. Almost feel normal. 

If I can do it, anyone can. 

Today was day 5. The hardest. There are a dozen kratom head shops we walked by today. As i was literally dragging my feet to make it up the hill in Gatlinburg. But no. 

Never again.

Was posting daily for accountability reasons and really enjoying the community aspect here. I can’t thank you all enough for your previous support. My hope is that those who were previously engaging are staying strong and on course to living their best lives. 

It’s not easy to admit, but I’m here to say that I’ve fallen back in. Making another attempt at cutting this stuff out of my life. Past quits have lasted between 6 - 40 days. Always CT, as I have absolutely no will power to efficiently taper down.

So.. why I caved.. Well.. A family emergency suddenly popped up. I quickly packed some things, jumped into my car and started driving hours south. I had left very early in the morning and wasn’t due to arrive at my destination until later in the pm hours. After hours of driving, I had stopped to gas up, to then hit the highway for the next stretch of the journey. As I’m exiting this tiny little town, in the middle of nowhere, I see a sign that reads “best priced Kratom in town.” At this point, I’m like 8 days ct into my recent quit and could only think about the hell I had gone through. No real cravings at this point as I was so incredibly done with this substance. My body was still incredibly sore and weak, but my appetite & emotions were coming back. Regardless.. the moment I read that sign.. BOOM.. Hard craving hit and I immediately turned around and justified an excuse. Just for this ride.. Get a tiny amount and relax for the rest of this journey. An interesting aspect of this is as I turn around. In someone’s yard is a sign that reads “don’t give up.” I immediately disregard that “message” and park in front of the shop. It’s only once, I think to myself.. Well, we all know how that goes. 

My family member is terminally ill and I promised  myself that I wouldn’t let them see me like this. Well.. they did. That one stop along the way turned into being able to get it anywhere & everywhere. I absolutely can’t stand how easily accessible this stuff is. That goodbye to them was devastating as it very well may be the last time I see them. All while not being my true self. I could feel they could sense it. Something was off in me. 

I got back home and continued to use. Visiting all my old “friends” who had asked where I had been. With a smile on my face, just said that I was out of town for work. Dosing all day, everyday. Doing nothing but. It didn’t take long to become disgusted with this way of life once again. But man is this stuff tricky to put down. The mental game here is beyond words difficult. Yet, we all hit that breaking point. Yesterday, I hit mine. 

I’m making it a point to post here daily. At least for the first couple weeks.. then intermittently afterward. Again, for accountability and to uplift you and support you along your own journey. As we walk this path together. 

Wishing you all strength and please stay the course. Trust me when I say, it gets SOOO much better. Stick to it and you will see for yourself.

2020-10-21 12:58:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jfgrx4/need_tapering_advice_but_ideally_only_from_those/,Need tapering advice but ideally only from those who had success...,"Ive been taking Kratom for two years.  it was a 5g/day habit for the first year.  I'm a Jiu Jitsu athlete and it really helped with the soreness and injury pain.   Then earlier this year I herniated a disc at L3/L4 and spent four month waiting for surgery in pain every day.  My habit went up to 20g/day in short time, but the biggest mistake I made was dosing more frequently.   I soon realized my body wanted it every 5 hours which meant waking up at 5am with RLS.  Thats the point I decided enough is enough. 

Fast forward to today.  I've had my surgery and am relatively pain free.  Ive started my taper and am now down to 12g/day split into four doses.  Here is my schedule...

7am (3g), noon (3g), 5pm (3g), 10pm (3g)

 Now the issue is that I'm having trouble lowering my dose.  As soon as I go to 2.5g I start feeling the withdrawals sooner (after about 3.5 hours) so then I spend 1-1.5 hours uncomfortable (headaches mostly). Also, the withdrawals at 5am are worse and come on sooner as soon as I lower my dose (I refuse to dose at night - its a line I've drawn personally).  What I'm wondering is, would it make more sense to increase the frequency to every four hours instead of every five hours? It makes sense on paper but I'm apprehensive about increasing frequency because thats what got me here in the first place!  Also wondering if the increased frequency will make the nights harder (earlier withdrawals)

For those of you who have tapered successfully I'm wondering how often your doses were and how you dealt with the sleep length issue (sleep will always be the longest period I go between doses).  I am using weed, CBD, and black seed oil which seems to help with the RLS somewhat.

I started with a fast taper, cutting down to 20 GPD within a few days of starting and went through REALLY bad WDs. All of the classics; RLS, sweating, nasal drip, irritability, etc., so I decided to slow down the taper. It's a marathon, not a sprint, right? I've been on this current step for about 4 days, and will take my next step down on Friday. I'd like to be off the sludge ASAP, but the WDs were just too much to handle while trying to stay with it at work and with homeschooling the kiddo. Not trying to beat myself up too much about it.

I realized it gave me a really good low grade painkiller feeling that I really liked and at the time not realizing the addictive capabilities I started doing it regularly. Fast forward to present day I’m basically hopelessly dependent on this damn drug, I’m dosing about 3 times a day and while this could be inaccurate I’m guessing I’m doing somewhere between 40-60gs a day at this point. I desperately want to quit and have tried a couple weeks back which is when I initially realized I was addicted. My withdrawal symptoms seem to be more intense then a lot of the accounts that I’ve read while lurking here. Chills, hot flashes, RSL especially in my ass if that makes sense, literally can’t sleep, shit I wake up in the morning and feel so fucking awful until that first dose kicks in. Now I know myself and I know cold turkey is my best shot which is where my problem lies. My job is 6 days a week and it requires me talking face to face with multiple clients each day usually 2-3 hours at a time. When I tried to quit the first couple times this was when I threw in the towel. The wd symptoms are brutal and kick my ass but the fact that I literally cannot do my job when I’m going through them is what is holding me back. I know it’s an excuse at the end of the day however I have to make money and I can’t just take a week off of work because my dumb ass got hooked on gas station powders lmao. I’m reaching out in hopes someone here has been in a similar situation and can offer their advice on the best possible route to take.

I’m basically taking it so I can do my job and that’s all that I do.

I quit drinking 11 days ago, and in trying to solidify my decision and believe myself that I was actually making a change, I remembered how I had quit kratom and how possible it is to get out from under a substance. Out of curiosity, I was searching my gmail inbox for ""kratom"" to see when I last purchased it (I used to go to a store that would email a receipt). That's when I realized it had been almost 2 years. I found an email that I apparently wrote to myself. As much as it sucks to think about, remembering the shitty parts of being addicted to a substance helps me to stay the course. Not dwelling on it or getting depressed about it, but not forgetting it's part of me. 

Here's the email:

Saturday I ran out of kratom. Been taking daily for 2 years. My best friend quit recently (the one who introduced me) and so I figured what the hell.

If I believed in hell, the last two nights when my head hit the pillow would be it. I have never had much trouble sleeping and absolutely hate the feeling of rolling and thrashing around trying to get comfortable. Not to mention the anxiety of knowing that I have to fulfill obligations the next day regardless of how I feel.

Even though I’m only on day three, I can now recognize that there’s no way that I would go buy some more where as day one I was trying to rationalize tapering. What the hell, already two nights of hell down, let’s get a few more down and see how this thing plays out.

Surprisingly emotionally I feel fine. Not in the least bit upset or having trouble with controlling emotions. Something that is unlike me is that I can’t fucking get off the couch. Typically I have trouble sitting still even through one movie because I feel like I should be doing something, but all I want is to lay on the couch.

I feel pretty confident. The hardest part is the looming anxiety of going to bed tonight. As I said I feel extremely sluggish but decent during the day, but as soon as my head hits the pillow I’m instantly a hot sweaty thrashing mess.

I  remember it sucking real bad, but it's not something I think about... and I'm so glad to not take kratom every day. Sex sucked (#weeniedontwork), the extreme tolerance building sucked, having to down scoops of nasty ass powder sucked... it's the perfect drug, the first time... it's close to perfect the next few months. 2 years later when your spouse is upset because you can't get hard, your eyes are puffy and have dark circles under them, and there's mysterious green powder all of your work desk/car/teeth... fuck that, and I'll never go back to it. I've seen one person convert their entire team at work into kratom addicts. It seems so innocuous, but that shit is no good for daily use. Personally, I CAN have it every few months and not go back to it, but I've seen a ton of people who are helplessly addicted and have tried to quit for years. I fully support anyone quitting, and just know you're in for a few shit days, but your body and mind will adjust, I promise. It's not impossible - you simply don't take it.

I was using 100+ gpd for 8+ years straight. This is my first time quitting. This forum helped me a lot in working up the fortitude to get it done.  

I spent a week doing a rapid taper from 100-0. If I’m being honest, that was probably the hardest 7 days so far. I was basically going as long as I possibly could prior to taking the smallest possible dose every day. On what would have been the 8th day of the taper, I jumped and have been sober for 21 days since then. The first week was marginally better than the taper, but still hard due to extreme fatigue and “blah” feeling. Each week has gotten significantly better since then. I’ve been having some PAWS, but like others have posted, they seem to come in waves. So far, the waves have been only a few hours long. Sleep got better around day 12 and I’m back up to 8 hours a night. Around day 17 I even started having dreams again for the first time in almost a decade. 

The positives so far have been:
-Appetite is back with a vengeance
-Libido is back
-I look healthier in the face already. 
-I’m much more engaged with my family 
-sleep is better than it ever was on K
-I feel mentally tough again. 

Some things that have helped me so far:
Healthy eating, workouts, vitamins, music, and most importantly, the desire to be the best version of myself for my wife and children.

I know I’m not in the clear, but even on my worst days right now, I’m so much better than I was when I was using(no matter what my addict brain says). 

If you guys have any questions, I’d love to help. Believe me when I say that if I’m having success, any of you can. A year ago, I thought it would be impossible for me to make it a 2 days. 21 days later, I’m still Alive and kickin! We are all tougher than we give ourselves credit for.

But I have found some validation and hope in hearing your stories, challenges and   wins regarding kratom use.

My ex was a heroin addict for a good 10-12 years of his life - basically late teens through his 20s.  He spent 6 months in a residential rehab, came out having done a lot of hard work.  I met him toward the tail-end of his use, encouraged his rehabilitation and was a supportive person in his life when others enabled him (his family) and friends turned a blind eye.  Six months after his rehab, I got pregnant.  Our lives go from being centered on our own individual health and sobriety (I had become sober from alcohol) to taking care of twins.  I supported our family financially and was stretched really thin.  He was a stay at home dad.  Things were hard and tense.  Six months after the kids were born, he introduced a joint one night.  And then encouraged a glass of wine at a cafe.  Before we knew it, he was smoking pot all of the time and I was drinking every night after the kids went to bed.  It was miserable.  And then he started doing kratom.  I googled it and was horrified.  Given the similarity to opiates, I expressed my fear.  He said it was harmless.  I tried to quit drinking several times but found it hard with a partner that was using substances and was increasingly walled off and had no interest in being sober.  So many nights I pleaded that our family was suffering and was told my health was my problem and his was his problem.  Every so often I would find the empty packets of extract pills.

We broke up a little over a year ago.  Shortly after and once he had a job he started heroin again.  Lost his job because he overdosed at work and lost consciousness.  Detoxed but never did rehab.  Was “clean” for a couple months and then relapsed again.  Since the second relapse he has been taking random urine tests that frankly I do not even trust.  But I know he is deep into kratom.

His behavior has been extremely selfish and marked with years of gaslighting.  I was always the problem.  He does what he wants to do and wants no repercussions.  If there are repercussions, then I am doing something to him and he is the victim.

He believes that whatever substance he uses, he would never put the kids at risk.  This includes heroin.  The delusion is unreal.

Substances has ruined a good person.  He was an amazing partner and father.  And we had a special relationship with many shared values and dreams.

I am 15 months sober.  The day we broke up and he moved out, I stopped drinking.  Needed the space absent the constant gaslighting and manipulation to get well.

Good luck to you all!  I hope you can kick the kratom and all substances.  No true and authentic relationship will thrive when one or both people are numbing themselves.",55,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9903934597969055}"

I've only been on Kratom for ten months, but holy hell is it hard to quit. First time I tried cold turkey, nope... Didn't even last a whole day. Second time (about two months ago) I tapered down to one gram three times a day from a 30gpd-50gpd habit. Once I tried to finally get off it, I caved and indulge and got right back where I started. About a week ago I re-upped and got two kilos. All of a sudden it wasn't working? Same brand, same strain, same everything. I was getting frusterated as I was in taking alot more to try and get my high. These last couple of days I've been having withdraw symptoms. Fatigue, chills, & runny nose. I figured that was my sign to just give it up. No sense in poisoning myself even more to try and get that feeling. I've lost so much hair it's ridiculous, that why I tried to quit the prior two times. Other than the fact that I'm tired of kratom ruling my life. I'm so over relying on it. 

Anywho, I guess since I was already having some symptoms while on it, today is not as bad as the last times I've tried to quit. The chills are terrible... And I'm shy on energy, but not near as bad as last time. Last time I didn't want to move and felt like I couldn't function. 

I took some allegra this morning to stop the nose running and I've heard it makes that mental itch go away. It really did... Wow. I've had kratom in my purse all day, just incase I couldn't get through my work day and I didn't touch it. I know that's not a good way to quit lol, but I had to have something to fall back on incase I couldn't work. 

Now that I'm 24 hours in, I'm in for good. This is the longest I've ever gone and I'm okay. I even got two miles in (I run quite a bit as it is). I've heard exercise makes you feel better and I was pretty blah. Feeling a bit better. Hoping for an okay day tomorrow, I want this to be the end. 

Some encouraging words would be nice and if anyone can tell me how long the dilated pupils last, that would be great. No one knows I've been using and with my light blue eyes, it's pretty damn obvious I'm on something or coming off of something. Makes me nervous as hell.

I'm currently on day 15 of going ""cold turkey"" (my definition of it anyway...) and I was wondering how some of you define that. Background of myself: Kratom user for almost 1.5 years... probably around 30-40gpd during the last six months (my highest).
So, like many of you, I have a cocktail of supplements to help with withdrawals. Specifically, I am taking DLPA, ashwagandha, tryptophan, velarian root, magnesium citrate, CBD (haven't noticed anything from CBD...), Biotin, vitamin d, kava and a multivitamin. I HAVE used loperamide to help relieve the symptoms at night right before sleep; when I say I use it, I take the recommended dose only (2x2mg pills). That's has helped put me to sleep with the RLS, but after doing further research into it, I'm going to try and cut it out completely as this stuff can apparently prolong WD symptoms. Granted, the negative stuff that I've read about loperamide is from people consuming anywhere from 10-30+ pills a day... I don't do that, but if even the recommended dose will cause issues, I'd rather just suffer through sleepless nights and get it over with.
Anyway, so, for the question about cold turkey, how many of you have actually taken NOTHING for your acute and paws and just grit your teeth? I'm thinking about doing this if it helps get everything over with sooner, unless it doesn't make a difference (in which case I would rather be comfortable than miserable if the timeline is the same).
The only vices that I really have now is coffee and nicotine. I used to drink a lot, but Kratom cured that for me on day one. I still don't have any desire to drink even without Kratom, thank God.
Anyway, back to my question: has anyone quit Kratom without any supplements/medicine? Would there be any evidence that this would get your body and mind back to normal faster? Thanks, and good luck everyone!

She expounds on a lot of the ideas that I see people repeating, searching, and grasping for here. With most addictions people know that it’s bad, and knowing that doesn’t help them quit. In her book she shows you that the reasons why you do use are unfounded, and untrue. 

She illuminates on how the subconscious, which controls our pleasure seeking, works relentlessly to confirm our biases. This is why it’s so hard to start stopping. Because we make a conscious effort in a moment, but the following moments are filled with your subconscious decisions. This is what cravings are, and why we feel like we enjoy using so much, but in actuality it’s just silencing the subconscious cravings.

I finally mustered the courage to quit, thanks to this sub. I’ve been on a taper for the past 2 months, and am down to steady 2.5g/day (.4g 6x per day - every 3 hours)

The main issue I have, is that like clockwork, every night around bed time, I get these sudden onset excruciating headaches that feel like a migraine behind my right eye, and it pulsates through my brain until i finally go to sleep from exhaustion. 

I think it is the same mechanism that makes it impossible to sleep - as it comes at the same time, and almost always follows that ‘shaky’ feeling like currents flowing your nervous system.

Has this happened to anyone else? I’m very worried that this will be long term, as it’s been happening the last 2.5 weeks without resolve.

I'm always lurking and reading every post and I can see there are at least 4-5 of you right in my ballpark of 9-12 days cold turkey. Tomorrow will be 11 days for me. It helps so much knowing there are other people going through the exact same thing I am right this second.

As my acute symptoms die off little by little, I have already caught myself thinking 'Well, what the fuck do I, now that I'm sober"". I'm 30, I work full time and have a family, but I've really only been stone cold sober about 6 months one time in the last DECADE. Ive made it through a xanax addiction in my early 20s, heavy drinking after that, about 5 years of opiate abuse(Norco, Percocet, Oxycodone, Oxycontin, Morphine, Heroine a couple times). Kratom was a godsend for the first couple years because it was the most sober I had managed to be but after 2 years of use I realized it wasnt much different than the other drug addictions Ive had. 

So, now Im finally sober as fuck, raw dogging reality. I work full time, and I do have hobbies, I love working out, and martial arts, I was going to a MMA gym and a weightlifting gym before covid started and Im really into video games and anime and I also like spending quality time withbmy girlfriend and her 5 year old.... but nothing feels right. Im apathetic towards everything the last couple days, everything sounds a little boring everytime I go to do something. 

So for my people out there who have made it 30, 60 days and beyond, what were some strategies you used to ease back in to real life after being in a numb haze for so long? Any thoughts you have would be appreciated. Sorry for the lengthy post, and stay strong anybody who is struggling!",11,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.990549623966217}"

I was able to finally get some rest and they propelled me into the weekend.  I slept a lot this weekend.  I did take some RSO (Rick Simpson Oil, cannabis extract) and that conked me out Friday night.

I now seem to be experience waves.  Moments where I feel normal again, have energy and feel OK... followed by moments where it’s like reality been turned back on and I start feeling all these emotions and it can be overwhelming.  There’s still those times where I am just exhausted, yawning and stuffy nose.

I do feel significantly better.  I feel like I’m starting to turn a very small, but good, corner.  The next 2 weeks will still probably be difficult but each day will get better and better.  

It is a little overwhelming, as I mentioned.  There’s an an anxiety creep that comes with it.  You start realizing all these great things you forgot but you remember old ones too.  Kratom really suppressed some of my anxiety issues, so now it’s turning back on full throttle.

I worry a lot.  I just overthink situations and work to prevent them.  This can exhaust me.  This is amplified in a withdrawal, when normally... I let it slide or move on.  God... it sucks so god damn bad.  It’s horrific.  There are times when the anxiety just becomes so overwhelming that you aren’t even thinking about the issue anymore but are focused on this distinct anxious feeling.  It’s like you can see the chemical reaction in your body.  It’s god awful.  Luckily, this tends to fade, albeit slowly.  I foresee it taking another 2 weeks before it really tapers.

The thing I keep dreaming of is where I just feel relaxed and good again.  A point where I’m not exhausted, anhedonia is gone, no sniffles, digestive is back on track and I don’t feel like I’m in some dull existence.  Anxiety and depression gone.  I’ve been there before, so I know I can make it again.  I just have to grind it out... and wait.

I saw something that made me realize how long I had been taking.  I have quit several times before, this is just my most recent stint.  Basically, I started taking kratom again in February.  I took it most of the time, with maybe 1 or 2 small quits, until July.  In July I quit for 2 weeks.  However, from July until October, I was straight using 20-30g a day.

Like I said, I do feel better.  It’s just going to be tough through this next phase.  Here’s to next weekend!",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9737763404846191}"

First off, I just wanna say that this forum has been instrumental in me reaching this point. I have been lurking since February when I first became concerned about my usage. 

A bit of background; I had been using Kratom since April of 2019 - ordering from an online vendor - off and on - until December of 2019 when I found a local headshop selling quality product. At that point, I began using nonstop daily for ten months in heavier and heavier dosages until I reached a point I said enough was enough. 

I have taken a week off from work in anticipation for a 10/15 quit date and I took my last dose at work around 7:30pm EST on Thursday 10/14. I am currently approaching 72 hours cold turkey and honestly I feel pretty good. My primary symptom at this point is trouble regulating body temperature - the cold chills and the goosebumps are pretty persistent. I've been sleeping better progressively each night and I even managed to get around four-five hours of sleep the first night.

I'm using a variety of supplements as needed but I believe the most pivotal supplements I have utilized may be DLPA and ibuprofen. When I've attempted to quit prior, the RLS was unreal yet this time, 72hrs in, I have experienced absolutely no RLS and I believe that may be due to the dopamine supplementation. 

I didn't experience many cravings the first two days but they have come in waves today on day three. They weren't overwhelming per say but I kept a stash of Kratom in my dresser just as a power move, knowing I could take some at any time if things got too bad. I will likely dispose of this stash tomorrow or the following day as I become confident I'm totally through the thick of it. 

All in all, I feel pretty well now but I'll be glad when the damn chills hit the road. I'm honestly bored as shit just sitting at home now and I kinda wish I hadn't taken an entire week off of work; perhaps it would be beneficial to return to work to help keep my mind off things. 

Thank you guys for all of your support and feedback - I really appreciate it and for those considering a quit, please just do it. You'll definitely be so much better off in the long run. :)",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8613043427467346}"

I'm 6 weeks clean today (yay)! I don't drink much anymore but since I've quit kratom I've had 2 nights of having a few drinks (like 3 glasses of wine). One was a couple weeks ago and the other was last night. 

Both times, I went to bed and fell asleep fine, only to wake up a couple hours later feeling like I'm back in WDs again: pounding heart, awful anxiety, feeling like my whole body is vibrating, and can't sleep much the rest of the night. I have been still experiencing PAWS here and there but this is much more intense.

Has anyone else experienced this? And if so, how long til it went away? I do like having some drinks now and then but this is just not worth it at all, so I will be waiting a while before trying that again...

If you look into my post history you can see how bad I struggled. Weeks of sleepless nights, compulsively thinking about Kratom and what I could do just to feel human temporarily as I recovered. I've accomplished a lot in life; career goals, fitness achievements,seeing my parents genuinely take pride in me, but that all pales in comparison to how genuinely proud of myself I was and still am for beating kratom. 

I was soooo far gone. Dosing every 3 hours whether it be at work, home, vacation or a road trip I never missed a dose. Anywhere from 100- 160 GPD for more than 1.5 years.

I have have went through detox and withdrawals 4 times before. Once the physical withdrawal symptoms are gone I would start taking it again thinking I'm in the clear. How stupid. If you are thinking of quitting its important to know about paws. That's where I messed up before. If you are going to go through with this tell loved ones. I told my family especially my mom and my girlfriend of 12 years. They were my cheerleaders through this. This time it was worse than ever. Sometimes unbearable. But something was different. This time I was just sick and tired of taking it. I was dosing every two hours. I've been taking it for 3 years. But dosing every 2 hours for the past year. Starts to become a burden. Not having the desire to have sex is a burden on her. I was picking of hurting. Hurting loved ones. And hurting my bank account. I do not recommend this next part but this how sick of it I was. I kept a bag with probably around 100 grams in my spare bedroom. This was not just in case. This was a power move for me. Knowing I could just dose whenever. It's day 17 and me and my girlfriend went to the grocery store. I hopped in the car with green dusted saddlebag I had it in. And said it's time to toss it. The look she gave me as if she was proud of me felt so good. We go to a dumpster behind the grocery store and I tossed it. Felt so good. I played the heaviest song I knew on the way home. She hates really heavy music but she let me have my moment. Please tell people if you are going through with this. It helps a lot. My mom would text everyday and ask how I was doing. Of course I would downplay how bad I was really feeling but that's what you do with mothers. You try not to freak them out. But anyways it gets easier. You are going have bad days but that's ok. It's better than hiding all your feelings. When you are going through withdrawals it helps to cry I found out. Let those toxic tears out. Laughing feels genuine now. I can actually feel dopamine flood into my head when I laugh. Started to take interest in the things I love to do. You are a hollow shell that's learning to become human again. It can be scary and exciting. I know you can do this. It is possible. Find your reasons to quit and hold onto them with everything you got.
I was talking to my twin brother the other night and I told him how I hate that I did this. He said yeah you've relapsed a couple times and all that but you never gave up.

I had used about an ounce a day for a year and a half.. I jumped CT @ the start of stay-@-home orders. It was hell, but I made it for 4 months before relapsing.

I was back at my love’s house for the first time since before I’d quit. Comforted by him & completely exhausted, I still slept not one wink & I just don’t understand it. 
Maybe I do though.. I had used 60 Gabapentin in the first two weeks of both of my quits. Of course, they helped tremendously, but this time, I suspect that they are also a part of my problem. Another contributor is that last week, I finished a round of steroids that I was forced to take due to a scary dental emergency. For the record, steroids during Kratom & Gabapentin withdrawal (on top of a gnarly tooth infection & costly fix) sucked super bad for me.

Some background info:
For the last five to ten years I’ve been doing prescription drugs every now and then when needed and mostly I’ve been able to steer away from addiction due to not doing it too often. 
In late 2018 I had some rough months and did way more tramadol than I should’ve, and had to go through some withdrawal. After that I stayed practically all clean during the whole 2019. 
But ever since I quit that time I get this super uncomfortable tension in my chest/back whenever I do something physically that will get my pulse up. So I haven’t been able to work out or anything like that since then.

In April this year I found Kratom and it seemed to be such a good alternative to opioids and it was supposed to be non addictive (lol), natural and yada yada. 
I ended up with a 30 gpd habit which I’m now about to quit. Last weekend I jumped from 30 to 8 gpd and it wasn’t too bad, although my fkn chest/back problem came back immediately, and way worse than before I started. I can’t even vacuum the house without having to lie down afterwards feeling like shit.

It also affects my sleep. If I do something physical during the day, I can’t sleep for shit.. And it’s supposed to be the exact opposite..
The only thing that has helped was starting ssri-medication, but it was only initially. After a week the problem came back even if I upped the dose.

I’ve been to several doctors and tried several things such as yoga, mindfulness, medication, different types of food and so on. Nothing works.

I really want to quit the Kratom but find it so hard to find the motivation when this problem occurs.. I mean, even if I stay sober forever I’m not sure if this will ever go away. Feeling hopeless..

Anyone ever experienced something like this? Would be so nice to talk to someone!

I quit kratom about 6 months ago. After almost 2 years daily use of it. About 10-15gpd. 

After it i had some relapses.. But only for few times. But now almost 2 months ago i relapsed and bought around 80g of kratom. I had it for month and half, i was having breaks. I was dosing 3,5g once or twice per day, with breaks.. 

Then i realized that i’ve fucked up. I relapsed because of my anxiety. Im going throught spiritual awakening with dpdr and anxiety and shits hard af. I cant do almost anything and i need to start doing something because i got some job from my brother ( just helping with his websites) but even that is so hard for me..

So around 8or9 days ago i ran of kratom and decided to quit completly again. It was almost fine for few days but the last 3 days its hard. 
I just wake up and i feel anxiety. Like out of nowhere. I had this for long time because that spiritual awakening and anxiety disorder. But now it was better. Because of meditations, cold showers and books xD. But now its hard to just sit down and meditate. 

Didnt realized that im going to have withdrawals again like this. I was expecting some wds but not like this and im little bit scared of how long it can take? 


If there is someone with similar experience. Like going throught hard anxiety problems even with spiritual awakening, dark night of the soul or how to call it. How did you got throught it? Its even extreme hard process even without withdrawal and addiction problems...  :( im scared. 

Is there something what helped you? 

I feel better than before. I dont have urges, i domt want kratom. But i just need to start working, im useless for months..

My story is quite different, I've read a lot of posts from you in this thread and usually I saw people taking pretty big doses during half a year minimum. 
I started just 2 months ago and was really shocked by the effect it gave, it was just 5 gr and I was already feeling the euphoria. The next day I decided to take much more without eating any food before consuming. That went really bad, I was vomiting blood and had a strong headache for the next 2 days. That was the turning point for me, but after a week I started consuming much more, so eventually I came up to a 50gr per day minimum and I was also mixing them (red and green). Sorry for swearing, but I was shitting blood and my hair started falling. I stoped with a CT method and didnt actually get any withdrawal effects. After a short break (5 days) I started to use it again with even higher doses, because at this time I didnt feel any negative post effects. I was eating about 60 gr twice a day for only 2 weeks and I simply ran out of it. Due to the finance troubles I couldnt order any more kratom so I stayed sober for the next 3 days. That was the time when I felt the negative effects. It's all the same as you speak about, but I dont feel it too strong, for me its like a minor depression. But in case of physical pain, restless legs dont allow me to sleep at all. Insomnia hits really hard, cold sweat and runny nose are just making things even more uncomfortable. 

I wanted to ask those of you, who haven't been using it for a long period (just like 2 monthes as I did), how long did it take you to recover and quit?

I've been tapering for a while in expectation of fully running out while living in Australia (illegal here). I know wake up with my usual sluggishness that tea helps, but with no sort of withdrawal symptoms, and go about my day fine.

But then, depending on the day, between about 5p-9p I start having really strong cravings. For me it feels like a like of appetite despite being hungry (my partner makes a lovely dinner for me most days and I want to be able to eat it cuz I'm a bit on the skinny side) and a general feeling of discomfort in my skin.

Now I've ALWAYS felt this discomfort in my skin, I've been an addict of sorts my whole life (like in primary school it was self mutilation sort of stuff). I don't really seem to feel it most of the day at this point which is awesome, and I don't know if theres anything to do to deaden it in the evening. Usually I just give in and have about 1-2tsp of kratom and feel better. I have clonazepam and when I take that I'm able to sleep and generally don't feel too anxious but to take enough to get rid of that ""get me out of this body and brain"" feeling I have to take so much that I'm loopy the next day.

Anyway, I doubt anyone's really gonna solve my lifelong psych issues so the question for the forum is more: when I soon run out, at just about 1-2 teaspoons once a day in the evening, how bad a withdrawal should I expect? I'm actively looking for work right now (hospitality/retail as I'm on a limited visa) and I don't want to get myself into a situation where it's too much to handle. I'm sort of hoping I might have tapered off the worst of the wd already and it's all a psychological addiction now - but have people had bad WDs from a teaspoon a day?

I am so glad I did! It’s so worth it. Don’t let WD intimidate you, don’t put it off. If you wait for the right time, you won’t do it. Make a plan to set yourself up for success and jump. You will come out stronger and gain so much respect for yourself. Don’t take shortcuts, don’t swap it out for another substance- you can do hard things.

This is my second six-month bout with kratom. I have ADHD and prefer to stay away from stimulants; heard about kratom, and for a few months it was perfect. Three years ago, I went cold turkey off a daily 90gr, and it was all sorts of hell. Like, huh, who'da thunk I'd be addicted to opiates. Took months to recover. Sex sucked. Music sounded amazing. I got well.

A whole bunch of life happened, and at the start of the pandemic, I found myself needing to get even the option of amphetamines out of my life for good, and turned to kratom.  


I've managed to keep it, most days, at 16-20gr. In the last month, an extra dose has started to appear. My beard is thinning. My gut feels like shit. Sex sucks. And yesterday, my birthday, I had a panic attack after my dose started wearing off; it was bad enough for me to go to the hospital.  


SO  


Time to quit.  


I have the taper guide pulled up, but I'm wondering if anyone can fill me in on what to expect in terms of withdrawal at my doses. Today it's been 16gr. Might find its way to 20gr, but the most I've gotten to this round is 28gr. 90gr was the, uh, fucking worst thing ever, so can I expect less hell? Or is any level hell actually all of hell?

Looking back through these I remember that each time I started to quit I meant it 100% at the time and each time until this last one thing or another would lead me back there. Either thinking I had conquered it and that if I could stop at all that meant I had control to stop whenever I wanted, or having a super tough week at work and on top of that feeling a lack of joy in my life while not talking to anyone, a therapist or my wonderful partner, about what I was feeling.  I think around the 3rd time and 4th time I had more of a ""Fuck it"" feel.  I wonder if the cycle of being off and on Kratom affected my mood and perception of reality so much that it made it easier to fall back. I remember thinking that my partner was so critical of me. I could barely stand to hear her speak to me. It was around this point that I had a sort of awaking with her help and we talked things out and it really helped me to see how warped my reality was. Not too mention how much I was drinking in the period between my 2nd and last quit attempt that carried over into early summer.  In July I went to the hospital with a heart rate of 170 just sitting on the couch. I thought I was going to die right then right there.  I had had palpitations before, but I'm not sure if they were this high or not. I had a watch that could read my heart rate this time. I went to the ER and they kept me overnight. Turns out I wasn't having a heart attack and that my heart and lungs (despite smoking for 20 years) were in good shape.  This was the complete turning point for me. From that moment forward my focus has been my health. Eating as healthy as I can, exercise and sunshine.  The Drs think I might have something called SVT, but palpitations can also be caused by Marijuana and drinking as well. I've since cut both out of my life. I've also started therapy. I had tried before 3-4 times with no much success but I finally found someone I felt good talking to. That's one part I wish I had done differently as well. I would get so discouraged after a session with a Therapist I didn't like that I just wouldn't go back and wouldn't look for another, until a new relapse or some other episode.

Day 118 for me since I quit. This morning I woke up in an unusually negative head space. Shortly after waking, I did my usual Wim Hof Method breathing exercises combined with a few minutes of meditation, followed by 2 additional rounds of WHM breathing. My thoughts briefly drifted towards kratom, which is unusual for me. I quickly nipped those dangerous thoughts in the bud by recognizing the LIE and immediately replacing it with the TRUTH. I can NOT safely use kratom and nor do I ever want to try. But it's very clear to me that if I hadn't ""redirected"" my thoughts, there's a good chance I could have been headed for trouble today. 

During my meditation it was made very clear to me that **I can control my thinking**. Lies can sneak in very quickly though if we are not vigilant and diligent. Do NOT let those negative thoughts linger. Do something about them immediately. Take control of your thoughts. Don't give your addict brain the chance to believe in the LIE that it's ok to use again.

Just a half-hour after waking up with anxiety and negative thinking, I was able to turn my head-space around and I'm off to having another good day. I hope all of you do as well.

Just wanted to reach out and also ask a couple of questions.

I'm quitting after a daily habit which reached around 10-15g per day and lasted over a year.

I originally used Kratom to get off cocaine and it did its job, it also helped me get work done but now I think it has done its job for me and the negative effects outweigh the positive ones.

The main negatives for me have been decreased short term memory and cognitive decline.

But I think there are more subtle changes I will notice like I'm starting to see colour more and feel more in my body, I've also been less motivated in certain areas such as excercise, just spending all my time working on the computer.

Right now I don't feel like I have withdrawls, and it has been around 48 hours, I think this is because I quit after drinking one night and smoking weed, and I smoked weed yesterday and just had a splif recently, although I didn't feel that bad before smoking weed today.

Time will tell anyway.

So I was wondering when did people notice their memory come back and did they feel some creativity come back also?

I got to the DMV, was given a receipt indicating what I was there for and waited outside in the sun for about 30 minutes. The lady directing me decided to wait 30 damn minutes to tell me that I was actually missing my proof of residency, and since I moved, I needed proof of my new address. My dad picked me up and took me home to get my proof of residency. I arrive with everything I need a second time and get sent inside to wait for about 1 hour before getting called. I get to the desk and the lady informs me that my license is all the proof of residency I need. It was nice to know I wasted about an hour and a half of my day going to retrieve something that was unnecessary. I get sent to take my test after taking a crappy picture, and the machine freezes on the finger print detector. I go to another machine and do my test and I pass. Once everything is done I’m a little relieved, but I still need to get home, since my dad and girlfriend were both at work, I decide to call an Uber. Uber bounces me around from driver to driver with each one being farther and farther away. I cancelled and tried again, now they’re trying to pair me with a driver half a county away.

On Friday, September 29, after a ninety-day taper, I finally put an end to a kratom habit that had lasted for eight years. It feels wonderful to be free of this substance, and I never could have reached this point without help of everyone in this group. Thank you. 

It would be wonderful if we could start a conversation about the best way of dealing with kratom withdrawal cough. Also, since so many people are understandably concerned that a cough might be a sign of COVID-19, it would be helpful if those who have experienced a kratom cough could share their experiences in this thread. 

***What is kratom withdrawal cough?*** 

After reading through many old forum posts, I believe that a persistent, dry cough is a real symptom of kratom withdrawal. While cough is not as common as insomnia, restless leg syndrome, malaise, and those mysterious aches and pains which torment our bodies, it is still a symptom that *some* people experience in a very intense way. 

These are 'objective' reasons I believe that a cough can be one symptom of kratom withdrawal: 

* Kratom is used as a cough suppressant throughout Asia. According to [one peer reviewed article from The Journal of American Osteopathic Association](https://jaoa.org/aoa/content_public/journal/jaoa/932155/792.pdf) published in 2012, ""In Asia, kratom has been used to stave off fatigue and to manage pain, diarrhea, cough, and opioid withdrawal.""
* We know that opiates such as Vicodin and codeine are prescribed due to their antitussive, anti-cough effects. Though kratom is not technically an opiate, it sure does a good job of playing one on TV. :) We all know that it mimics classic opiate effects.

These are anecdotal observations which make me believe that cough is a symptom of kratom withdrawal. 

* Throughout most of my 20s and 30s, I was afflicted with a chronic, recurring cough that had no apparent cause It would persist for months and then would go away for many  months before returning.  I did smoke at that time, but this was not a smoker's cough. Doctors ran a battery of tests and initially decided it was cough-variant asthma. When further tests ruled out asthma, they basically shrugged and said ""Couldn't hurt to quit smoking."" 
* In 2012, my recurrent cough disappeared almost entirely. At the time, I did not realize that this coincided with the onset of my daily kratom habit. 
* In 2015, I experienced a massive, bilateral pulmonary embolism that had no apparent cause. I was immediately hospitalized for three days, and I decided to stay away from kratom indefinitely until my treatment was over. I ended up not using kratom for about four or five months. During this time, I was saddled with a persistent, recurring cough such as that which had plagued me in my youth. Eventually, the cough disappeared and did not come back for another five years. I did not realize it at the time, but the cough disappeared at precisely the same time that I resumed my daily kratom habit. 
* In 2020, as I approached the final month of my taper, the cough came back. Since we are in the midst of a global pandemic characterized by a dry, persistent cough, I was more than a bit freaked out even though I barely leave the house and have very limited interaction with human beings other than my wife and daughter. During the past two weeks, I have had two COVID-19 tests which definitively rule out COVID as a cause. 

For these reasons, I think it is reasonable to assert that a persistent cough is a real symptom that some users experience when they go through kratom withdrawal. In my case, I clearly had some predispositions which made me prone to fits of coughing, and this might be why I'm one of the people who experienced this symptom. 

 ***For those of you who have also experienced these symptoms, I have a few questions.*** Your answers would be really helpful for others who might be freaking out about this. 

1. If you have experienced kratom withdrawal cough, **what can you tell us about the cough?** When in your withdrawal did it start? Has the cough continued or did it finally fade away? 
2. Did you experience **any sort of recurring cough** ***before*** **you started taking kratom?**
3. What, if anything, did you find to be **most effective in treating this cough?** 
4. If your cough happened during 2020, **did it eventually compel you to get a COVID-19 test?** 

I think this could be super helpful because, when I was researching old kratom posts, I came across messages which emphatically claimed that cough is *not* a symptom. I also found many posts saying things like, ""Oh no, man, that never happened to me. Might be coronavirus. You should get tested ASAP."" As you can imagine, such posts are pretty scary, even if getting tested is a good idea.

Personally, my advice to anyone experiencing withdrawal cough who is worried about COVID would be that (a) if it is your *only* symptom, you're not feverish, you have been masking up and social distancing, and you still have a good sense of smell, you probably don't have COVID, but (b) if you are able to get an inexpensive or free COVID-19 test it is probably worth the indignity of a nostril swab to get some peace of mind about this. (Note: Since cough is a symptom of COVID, it will probably be much easier for you to get a test than it would be for someone who is not symptomatic at all.)

2020-10-14 16:18:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jb8ng4/day_12_a_small_improvement/,Day 12 - A Small Improvement,"Today was a very small improvement.  I believe it’s due to the fact I was able to sleep somewhat last night.  I saw a doctor (but did not mention kratom) and they prescribed me Trazodone (50mg) to help sleep and anxiety.

I took a dose last night and about an hour later I started becoming really sleepy.  I didn’t fall asleep right away but after 15-30 minutes I did.  The sleep was OK.  I woke up and went back to sleep a lot.  My dreams were very tense.  I always felt like I was searching or looking for something or trying to push some goal forward.  There’s a million reasons why I felt this way.  I woke up tired and did not want to go to work.  I pushed through and made it to work.  To my surprise, it went by quick.  So, ultimately it was better than anything else I’ve tried, including: weed, melatonin, valerian root, diphenhydramine (benadryl) and doxylamine (unisom).  I ended up with 6-8 solid hours.

If you were like me and googled “quitting kratom trazodone” or “kratom withdrawal trazodone”, the posts are mixed.  Some people hated it, some thought it was OK and some thought it helped.  I would be the category of helping.  It wasn’t great, but it did improve the situation.  I plan on taking 50mg tonight, so I’ll provide an update if I get the same results.

The sleep helped with energy.  I still feel heavy and lethargic.  Walking up the stairs feels like it burns my muscles out, despite being in better shape than I’ve been.  It did help make the day go faster, work a little better and me laugh a time or 2.  But I still have a long road ahead of me.

I still feel nothing 95% of the time.  I just feel dull, unentergetic, restless and no interest in anything. What’s weird is last week, I was sort of OK.  In fact, it was such a huge blur, but I definitely remember not feeling this bad.  Week 2 feels loads worse and like it caught up to me.  Maybe my body realized kratom wasn’t returning and it was time to course correct, so this is ultimately good?

Week 2 is always the worse for me.  Walking up stairs sucks.  You just feel how bad off you are in your whole body.  Your muscles ache, you become winded and you just feel bad.  Strangely, when I take supplements for body building, it reverses course and I feel so much better.  When I get to the gym, I kill it and feel so much better.

I took a break from the gym today.  I’ve been going steady, but today I could tell I was shaky from lack of water and food.  That coupled with the exhaustion would just killed myself.  My goal is to get some good sleep tonight and force myself to eat well at work tomorrow, that way I can go the gym and feel solid.

Other than insomnia, exhaustion and feeling dull the only other bad symptom is digestive.  It’s really ramped up in the past 2-3 days.  I am constantly using the bathroom and I will spare you the details, but you probably know how that’s going.  The bad taste in my mouth is getting better.  I not only quit kratom, but I also dropped soda, sugary foods, fast food, alcohol and pretty much anything bad for me.  It’s strictly been whole foods, water, black coffee and Greek yogurt.  Some gym, hiking and bike riding here and there.  The only real vice has been weed, which has mostly been the vape pen and dabs.  They provide a nice relief from boredom, but I think it also contributes to the exhaustion, so I don’t smoke during the week.

So, overall, it feels like baby steps.  This weekend, I have zero to do and no plans.  So I can rest and relax as much as I like and don’t have to worry.  It will do a lot for my health.

Lastly, I think I’m on a good course.  I think the exhaustion and insomnia will abate next week.  I think by next weekend, I will be much better.  I am usually still a little dull and uninterested but in week 4 that usually changes, which realistically... is just right around the corner.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9903697371482849}"

it was getting to the point where when I swallowed food it didn't feel like it was going down. i think my body is telling me to STOP. 

I think I'm as much addicted to the going to the store part of it all too, not just the drug, it's weird. it's like a little voice in my head tells me to go up there, and I freaking do it! madness. 

I MUST have success today. I must. I need something to feel good about. 

and lastly, it feels very good knowing that I have a community of people that know the struggle. virtual hug to you all. i also have spiritual support (God) that cannot be underestimated.",6,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8528450727462769}"

I just wanted to share my experience, partially to take my mind off of dosing and partially because it may be helpful! 

Starting with knowing how much I actually took everyday was vital. I have chronic pain (lupus), and CT wasn't an option for me. I wake up with 10/10 pain at least once a night. So I chose to taper, and tolerate my pain that way. 

I had always eyeballed it, and I can't believe I did that to myself! Looking back at the amount I was actually taking was astounding! I mean, I truly couldn've hurt myself. And confronting the amount in the face really drove me to start stopping.

Started 50+gpd (2 years that high, 4 years total)... and I felt like crap with or without K. I measured each dose with a scale, and just chose a starting point. I chose to do 4g/dose to start, just to see how I would feel... with doses every 4 hours. And it was crazy, as soon as I cut back I actually started feeling better. I think I was ODing every day for months. I was no longer carsick, nauseous, dizzy, exhausted. 

If you're going to start measuring, I highly recommend you do it for a full 3 days and write down the grams and the times you dose. Unless you're already meticulous about your usage, it's really important to get a full understanding of how much you use. 

It's been about a month and I'm down to 2g/dose every 3-4 hours, and trying to push doses to 5-6 hours apart. Pain is still a struggle, but much more manageable now.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9882010221481323}"

I tried to do a ct from 30gpd a few weeks back and I couldn’t do it at all so I just started taking 10 grams per day in the morning daily with little to no issue and then on Sunday jumped off. 

Days 1 and 2 were lame and I drank a 40z steel reserve to knock myself out at night, I find that worthwhile because I never get hangovers (2 big ass glasses of water before bed with 2 Tylenol usually does the job) and getting a solid 4-6 hrs of sleep helps with the cold turkey immensely, especially with your mental health. The lack of sleep is what I find gets to me the most and usually is why I relapse. The feeling of being so tired and not being able to sleep is horrible. 

Day 3 was the worst by far. I woke up anxious and depressed, my body felt sick, my thinking was clouded and muddy, I could hardly walk around. As the day progressed I started to feel a bit better but everything still seemed empty and grey. Once bedtime rolled around I threw a 40 back and felt way better pretty fast and after a while of tossing and turning went to bed.

Today I also woke up with some anxiety and felt like it was day three again for like an hour, but as the afternoon rolled around I started feeling way better, pink cloud effect?, possibly, but I’ve never really had super bad kratom withdrawal. My feelings are Starting to return aswell with my sense of reality. I’m hoping that it doesn’t change but I know sometimes withdrawal occurs in waves so I’m ready to see what’s gonna happen.

Along with alcohol for bedtime I’ve been taking 150mg XR of Wellbutrin every morning which has been great for the depression. I don’t enjoy it normally but it definitely helps to raise me out of a shitty withdrawal induced depressed state. 

I’m feeling good about tomorrow and I think ima be able to see this through really. I was baisically laid up for 3 days and kinda today even though I’m feeling a lot better. I think tomorrow will be nice for sure and I’ll 100% be able to say I’m over the hump tmmrw",1,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5469334125518799}"

My point in this post is to push some optimism. Quitting Kratom SUCKS on so many levels, but keep pushing forward, regardless of your chosen method of kicking. Once life starts twinkling back into your periphery it will give you the fuel to beat this. I am starting to get my appetite back. Music sounds better.

I didn't think I'd stick with it more than 3 days, but I forced myself to try.

I thought I'd give an overview of how it's gone so far, month over month.

**Month 1:** Hell yeah, I can feel again! I'm NEVER taking kratom again. The wool has been lifted.

**Month 2:** Still riding that high from quitting. It's like I'm experiencing everything in life through a new lens, after being numb for so long.

**Month 3:** Holy shit corona! I'm glad I quit back in Jan, I probably wouldn't have the will to stick with it if I started now.

**Month 4:** More productive at work (marketing) than I've ever been in my life.

**Month 5:** Cravings. Suddenly I want kratom again out of the blue.

**Month 6:** Cravings intensify. I don't know what's going on, but I forgot how sick of kratom I was. I'm remembering the good times.

**Month 7:** Mostly over the cravings now. Sticking it out through months 5 and 6 really strengthened my resolve.

**Month 8:** Got a promotion. Lots more responsibility. I feel level-headed and able to handle it.

**Month 9:** Back to the ""hell yeah"" phase. I don't like to praise myself too much but I'm incredibly proud of my accomplishment. I've never been able to quit anything this long.

I guess the main thing to take away from this is don't get discouraged if you start having cravings 5-6 months out. It's normal, and when you push through, you will come out so much stronger on the other side.

I’ve gotten almost every supplement listed on this page, and I just threw out the last of my Kratom. 
I’ve been taking Kratom daily for 3 years, I started because I was addicted to pills and my therapist recommended it to me, I started with 3 GPD, and overtime I started taking it multiple times throughout the day, and then I just started to take as much as I could to see how “high” I could get, at that point about 15 GPD
About a year ago (august of 2019) my father took his life and that’s when I started using Kratom even worse, and relying on it to numb the pain and make me go to sleep so I didn’t have to think about him. 
I got to a point where I’d force myself to go to bed everyday at 5pm and I’d induce sleep by taking excessive amounts of Kratom, and then I got to the point where I was taking about 20 grams in the AM and 35 grams in the PM, 
I started to have serious stomach and disgestive issues, I’d be woken up every morning at 6am with horrible stomach pain, nausea, no appetite
I got to a point where I wouldn’t eat at all because “I didn’t want having food in my stomach to interfere with the intensity of the high” 
I was not living, I want to get back to living a real life. I’m so scared, but I’m committed this time. This is my second time attempting to quit, but this is the first and only time that I want to quit, and wasn’t forced to.

Never addicted to it until the summer of 2007. New wife, new family .... but unfortunately a broken blended family. Even the wife was drinking the tea that I was making. She quit and I stayed with it .... for many more years. I started hitting some AA meetings and got a sponsor. I got clean from it 3 years ago and got 6 months under my belt until I caved in. I was not working my program; hindsight I was trying to figure out how to do the bare minimum and stay clean. That was a slippery slope... and I slipped. 

Now, I feel that my days are numbered before I try again. The problem that I've had is that I think my life is manageable. There is a lack of desparation.  I have a great job, make good money and sort of take care of my business. I'm also using over 100 gpd. 

What's not manageable though is my relationship with people. My wife sleeps on the couch, and I have no relationship with her kids, mine or even my 8 grand children. I've also lost a lot of hair, and at least 30 pounds of muscle. I've gone from 198 pounds at 6'1"" to 158 pounds.  My body is being effected.

-Quick taper went from 60 GPD to about 5 GPD in a span of 7 days and then quit completely. 
-Lots of Weed. I hadnt smoked in years so it was especially helpful. The first week was so brutal. The restlessness was the worst part for me. 
-Supplements-valerian, ashwaganda, L-thenine. Literally was taking handfuls of supplements. Seemed to help the anxiety a lot. 
-Lots of Immodium. I took about 20-30 pills a day for about 10 days. That really seemed to help. 
-A Whiteclaw or three if the restlessness made me want to die.

2020-10-13 19:15:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/jaov1v/my_tapering_plan/,My Tapering plan,"Some history:  I was introduced to Kratom 2 years ago. I took it a couple times a week for 9 months or so.  I was also drinking.  I noticed that when I used Kratom I did not want to drink so I decided to use it for that reason.  It worked!  But without really realizing what happened I started taking it daily.  And then I started taking more of it each day.. all without really noticing the difference.  Then I decided to change jobs.  That was the beginning of this year and included a drug test.  I read it is not tested for but decided to quit anyway.  With the intent to start back up after the test.

Well that was a surprising 2 weeks.  I went through withdrawals and during that time decided kratom was probably not worth it.  The first 4 days were difficult, and then things got markedly better... But I missed the calm daily ritual, so after my test I started using it again.

Fast forward \~7 months to today.  And i noticed i was going through a kilo in just a little over 3 weeks.  It dawned on my that meant just under 50g a day.  

I realized I had royally fucked myself.

Nowadays I wake up in withdrawal.  I do not get RLS.  I am one of the kind who gets butterflies/crushing anxiety instead.  Benedryl makes your RLS worse? It gives me a panic attack.  Interesting...  So I tried cold turkey again.  Wow.  Oops. Not like it was the first time which was bad. Plus I did not have the drop dead drug test as a motivator.  I couldn't make it past a day.

So I decided to try a taper.  I know I have the discipline under the right circumstances. But Kratom is a strong adversary. It makes you have bad judgement even when you are not very high on it. It affects your brain and allows you to rationalize things that really go against your best interest.  It's an addictive drug.  They all work like that.  

My problem tapering was to go too fast, and to set extremely ridged rules. Both not good for me.  I would get impatient, cut too much, and then sort of spring back take too much... get the wobbles, regret it.  You know the cycle don't you?

Then I was back to full throttle for a couple months.  Did CT again a week ago.  Too hard.

Then I realized this is not that big a deal.  I feel trapped, yes but it's an illusion. And it is OK for me to fuck up. I just need to find out my path.  So I decided to try a taper again.  I set much looser rules for myself... with more ""flex"" built into them.  And I've been at it a week and am already down to \~30GPD and am feeling BETTER not worse (well much of the time).

Here's my strategy:

* Start with a slightly aggressive first week. Start at 5g NO LESS THAN 2 hours apart
* By the end of week 1 get it down to 30GPD
* Then switch to dropping a 1/2g per dose, wait till stable (at least 1 week with drop on FRI)
* Lather rinse repeat
* If 1/2g is too much do 1/4 drops.
* Over the course of the week push times to skip doses if I want to
* Allow myself +/- .5 gram as a challenge/relief. eg. If I am at 4g dose I can do 3.5 or 4.5 depending on how I am feeling and it's all good/legal to the plan.

So I am at the end of week 1.  I have made it down to 30GPD for the last 3 days.  I do 4g 5-8x daily. Sometimes 3.5. Sometimes 4.3  But always in that window. For the last 3 days I have been skipping doses and keeping my total at 30 or less.

I feel TONS better.  I typically get some anxiety by the end of the dosing period (2-4 hours) but it usually passes, and the amount I am taking is enough to cause it to calm for most of the next stretch... sometimes more.  If it is more I go longer.

On FRI I will drop to 3.5G.  I will allow myself all 8-9 times at the beginning, and drop doses as it seems possible with the goal of doing 3g the Saturday after.  I will allow myself to NOT drop, but i will not allow myself to drop early.  The goal will be to keep the discomfort at a level that does not make me feel overly desperate.

Anyway. I will journal here... And I am sure my methods would be too lose for some but so far this is working great for me.  I am feeling really good being SIGNIFICANTLY more sober, and not all jangly at the end of the day.  Sleep is slightly shitty, but I can handle it and am still get 6-7hrs.

I’ve been feeling pretty normal these days and most importantly I’ve been sleeping great. Since quitting I’ve moved across the country, started hiking, working out and reading. When I was on the kratom sometimes I wouldn’t leave the house for 5 days at a time. I would watch tv in bed from the time I woke up to the time I went to sleep. It’s insane how much you don’t care about anything when you’re on it. You’re perfectly content letting your life pass by. I think covid shutdowns gave me my excuse but in all reality it was the kratom.  

The only lingering symptom is the occasional stomach pains but on other people’s recommendation I’ve found kombucha and Metamucil very helpful. Drink the Metamucil 3 times a day like it recommends. 

Anyone out there thinking about quitting, just do it. No day is gonna feel like the right day to do it so just choose one. I chose the day I ran out. I decided to just not go buy another bag. The first few days were horrible, not gonna lie. I think if you forced yourself to the gym you may sleep better than I did. Riding bikes helps with the RLS immensely. But seriously after about 3-5 days you will feel much better. It won’t seem like it’s gonna happen but then one day you just feel a lot better. Don’t give in during those first few days.

Days 4-5 were the worst because they sucked and it felt like the suffering would never end. Day 6 I turned a corner. Sleep started coming back. I would become overwhelmed by the emotion of music again and would find myself holding back tears. I am 37 right now and this is the first time I have been sober since I started college.

I heavily relied on this forum to get me through the acute phases of what I call contemplation (thinking about and preparing to quit), tapering, and finally going CT. 

For me, extreme hair loss was the kick in the face I needed to make it happen. I had full blown alopecia areata. There were a lot of other reasons as well, but the balding was devastating.

Despite the dermatologist having no clue about kratom, I knew there was an excellent chance it was the cause, in fact I hoped it was as otherwise that would mean accepting that I had alopecia and that there would likely be nothing I could do about it.

I got a few steroid shots on the bald patches over the spring and summer and every time I went back the office would marvel at my progress. I’m sure the shots helped but the fact that I went rather quickly and linearly from baldness to regrowth, I attribute to quitting kratom. I tried to explain this to the doctor but I could almost see her eyes glaze over when I tried to explain it to her. She seemed to think it was much more likely that the alopecia was caused by the stress of the pandemic than any substance I was taking.

I already had rather thin hair before all this and I think it’s possible I was/am especially susceptible to the effects kratom has on hair. I only took it for a few months. It’s still not totally back to normal and I dealt with shedding for a long time, even while it was growing back in. I think (knock on wood) that the shedding has finally subsided to normal levels. And I have short hairs sticking up all over my head (regrowth)

I wanted to post about this because when I started to lose my hair I spent a lot of time here looking for information about the connection to kratom, and hearing others say their hair came back after quitting really helped me. 

My advice is to do anything you can to help yourself quit. I would use work as an excuse to use and i finally realized I would rather lose my job then keep taking kratom. In some ways I am grateful for everything I’ve put myself through on this kratom/hair loss journey, but I wouldn’t wish it on anyone.

I was doing Kratom before like ~20-30gpd for 2 years. Needless to say the fentanyl was hundreds of times stronger as when I started I used like maybe the amount of a few grains of salt. I honestly was expecting to need a lot more because I believed kratom was a lot stronger and had my tolerance raised. I was very wrong because at peak WD I nauseatingly consumed probably close to 100 grams in a day to stop the fentanyl withdraw and even then it only took away like 50% of my WD symptoms. 
Not a look at me I’m strong sob story. My point I want to make is it could always be worse. My second point is that you will certainly recover. I mean by day 7 I was pretty much back to normal. I’m two weeks clean now & yeah I’m kinda an emotional mess still, have little energy, and get cravings of course but hey, I’m not stuck in bed with so little energy I can’t even grab the controller to change Netflix shows. I would legit just toss and turn for hours staring at the wall on the left, the right and then the ceiling. Me and them 3 got very well acquainted lol. 

So anyway, if I can kick fetty I know you all can get off the kratom. I’m off of all opiods now and I do remember kratom WD and I know there are physical WD’s, and maybe everyones body is different - but I really believe most of the WD is in your mind with kratom. You’ll have restless legs and low energy for sure but that is tolerable imo. I guess the mind adjusts to what it knows but idk, I hope I don’t come off as an ass, just try to look at me and be like “hey at-least I can get out of bed if I want to to walk down/up the stairs or w/e because I legit couldn’t even do that for 2 full days. I mean this is prob a TMI but I had a full 1 gallon piss jug next to my bed because I just couldn’t get out of bed lol. My sheets have like a permanent yellow stain from sweat too. It looks like one of those chalk dead body outlines which almost feels accurate for how I felt haha 

But anyway, and again, the main takeaway from this is in the title, within 7 days you will be mostly back to your normal self. Now this doesn’t make things any easier, I’ve always found it hardest to stay clean after the 7 days/long term. But hopefully you aren’t like me and this could provide some gratitude/motivational support to get through the worst of things if you happen to be going through those early WD stages from kratom right now. 

So yeah don’t give up and please exercise when you can. I’ve withdrew from nearly every opiate and can say exercise cuts recover time in half. I mean it makes your body produce beta-endorphins (bodies natural morphine). It’s especially good at soothing restless legs during WD so it’s a must if you suffer from that.",52,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968932867050171}"

- At five o’clock on the seventh day of sobriety I mentally broke down. I was feeling very fatigued and my skin would not stop crawling. The night before I didn’t fall asleep until 5am. I slept until noon. I decided that I would have a break and buy more kratom. I told myself that I would only buy one ten pack. Take five of them and take five the next day for a bike ride and be done with them. Of course, when I got there I bought two ten packs telling myself just in case it doesn’t work I’ll get more. Just in case. It is now 11:00pm. I’d hoped I’d be asleep by now and could get my circadian rhythm back in order. Instead I lie wide awake in my bed watching a movie. I’ve taken ten pills. 10 grams. My anxiety is elevated and feelings of guilt pulsate throughout my consciousness periodically. I’m upset that I let my mind bargain with, well, my mind again. I flushed the other ten pack down the toilet realizing I would rather have a prolonged withdrawal with a sharp mind and painful body than a dull mind with a numb body. I was invited to dinner tonight. I declined as I felt like my mind would not be as quick to respond in a conversation. Kratom is not good. No matter what you tell yourself as you go through withdrawal kratom does not give you anything. It only takes away. Please, the next time you get the urge to drive back to the store to get more, read this and dig deep to remember why you are quitting this nasty shit in the first place. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. You just need to be patient enough to slowly walk through the darkness until you reach the light. Because when you reach that light, and have to shield your eyes by its brilliance, you will let out a huge sigh of relief, smile contently, and let the sun warm your bones. You did it. You’re there.

When I was on my antidepressant and low dose prn benzo for Anxiety disorder, I functioned so much better. I was self medicating with K, and I'm done with trying to fix my issues myself.

To the point where I quit my job working on an ambulance to a much slower paced job. After I quit my job I gave up both nicotine and caffeine in the same day due to me thinking it was the problem, but I was still having these very high stress days filled with anxiety, panic attacks, and tachycardia. 

2 months had gone by with one 3am ER visit, a clean EKG, and a new prescription of a weak anxiety medication. The medication helped for the most part through out the day but I did not want to allow my body to become dependent on them. 

I am now almost 3 weeks of kratom, 3 months off nicotine and caffeine and my energy and over all mood has gone up. Anxiety problems come and go and are no where near as bad as they were, with only 1 pull of my anxiety meds every few days. 

The big problem in this situation now is I am actually leaving to the military in 2 weeks, fucked timing I know, and I’m having trouble with my heart rate while doing only cardio based workouts. Now I’m not sure it very possible that it is just directly related to my anxiety problem. But I am 23 years old, for the most part very healthy, and now build pools all day long. But I just tried to run a mile and about half way in I had a heart rate of 170+ and felt like I wanted to puke.

Well today, it has been about 7 and a half days of being sober and actually forcing myself to eat a lot of healthy food, I can say that my hair is definitely thicker. At first, I thought this was just wishful thinking, but then I asked my wife to judge for herself (who is a brutally honest person...she was one of the first to say ""oh my God! Your hair!"") I still have a lo g way to go, but I am definitely able to see a difference from Monday last week. I'm confident if you men stay off Kratom and actually eat a lot of healthy food, you'll be okay too (unless as you are balding genetically). Women, I know our bodies are very different hormonally, so I don't want to say things that I am not certain of, however many threads that I have read while in panic mode say it will almost certainly come back for you too. I'm going to take week by week photos and at the end of 3-6 months, I'll figure out somewhere to post them to encourage other people to stop as well as ease some anxiety they may have.

I'm also happy to report that 90% of the physical withdrawals have left. The only remaining one is RLS (which also means insomnia), which is still bad. Everyone is different and will have different issues while getting clean. Anyway, day 8 tomorrow at 1000. Good luck and good night everyone!

I started Kratom 6 months ago after a friend gave me a bag of the capsules. I work as an assistant manager for a trucking company and it’s balls to the wall 13 hours a day 6 days a week. I love the energy it gives me and I even got 2 raises in the span of 3 months. 

I take about 40 grams a day. I wake up at 5:00am and take my first dose of 20 grams. Then after lunch I’ll take another 20 grams. Well a few days ago my local shop ran out. It was a Thursday and the shop owner told me he would have more stock on Monday(today). I end up going to another shop Friday to get some but it was the same brand(experience red mang da). I wake up today and did my normal dose. But after about 3 hours I start having chest pains and it’s freaking me out. I have a very distinct pain on the left side of my chest. I though it was anxiety or something but It’s not. It’s almost like a dull warm pain. 

I really hope I didn’t damage my heart or something. I have a doctor appointment tomorrow.  I swear to god I’ll never touch this stuff ever again.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.981721043586731}"

Only 1 or 2 would be what I deem “quality.”  However, despite not sleeping well, I still had a slow roll of energy.  I could get on the computer, watch TV and look at my phone without feeling incredibly exhausted and bored.  That changes today.

I found pretty much everything exhausting.  The first 7 days weren’t this bad.  I just felt sort of crappy, but had plenty of energy.  I was thinking this time around, quitting again, would be easier.  It’s been extremely difficult.  Today, I really contemplated redosing, but told myself I can’t do it.  I have to fight through this as I have so many times before.

Part of the problem is I gave up everything that was helping me sleep.  When I was taking kratom, I would sometimes take unisom to hep me sleep.  Towards the end, I was taking it regularly.  When I first quit, I tried taking it but it was making me feel worse.  I was also taking some other things occasionally to help me sleep and so, I’ve quit them too.

That means I’m getting not much sleep.  I was up for more than 24 hours when I got home from work today.  I tried to nap, but it just wouldn’t start.  When I finally started falling asleep, it was this strangest feeling.  It was like these wild dreams where you chase this feeling that you know is in your mind that prompts sleep, but it never comes.  I did sort of fall asleep for an hour or 2, but for some reason this made me start having to pee a lot.  I woke up and peed 3 times within 2 hours and I barely drank any water that day.  Obviously my body is way out of whack.

I just feel so horrible.  I have no interest in anything and claw at things to give me some sort of stimulus.  The only thing that really makes me feel better is exercise.  However, I had to force myself to the gym today.  When I got there I was shaky and sick to my stomach.  I did as many workouts as I could before I thought I was going to puke.  I can tell the lack of sleep along with eating poorly is hurting my workout.  I’m glad I didn’t push it too far.

To be honest, I’m a little concerned.  I’m worried about how I’m going to make it through work for the next few days.  Work is a nightmare.  I feel like I need a whole month off just to get better.  Sadly, I don’t have that option.  I’ve made it through worse, I just have to keep toughing it out.

The best way to describe how I feel is that nothing feel good.  It all feels dull.  I don’t feel happy or sad, nothing makes me laugh.  I don’t have an appetite.  My stomach is out of whack.  I can’t sleep.  My energy is low.  My mind isn’t sharp.  Ultimately, I know I have to go through this to feel better.

Tonight, I’m going to try valerian root and melatonin and see if that works.  I’m hopeful, it will relax me enough to sleep but not be powerful enough to make me groggy tomorrow.

I have been successful on a lot of accounts. I have dropped to 5 g kratom, 0 mg ritalin, and 0 cigarettes a day. I am using nicotine replacement therapy with 14 mg patch and chew a 2 mg gum every couple hours.  The ritalin was the easiest to drop for me. I started sleeping and eating a lot more and the only other withdrawal symptom was a serious lack of attention which is fine right now. I'm getting through things okay without it. The kratom has been the hardest to drop though. I am down to 5 mg and I am feeling very emotional. It isnt a bad feeling necessarily because it's freeing in a sense. 

I'm noticing why I was numbing myself out on all these drugs. I hate the environment around me. I'm surrounded by people I dont like and need to hop myself on feel good drugs to get along with everyone. This realization is much harder than the withdrawal symptoms. I have to now deal with this shit without any drugs. Diarrhea, restlessness, sweating, etc are all baby symptoms compared to the hell my life has become. I'll take the physical symptoms anyday over this.

*muscle quivering

The depression, regret, the destroyed self-esteem, the self-doubt, and self-hatred. The liars of what tricked us into this. And most importantly, the shame. 

Society has shamed people like us to the point where it is ingrained into us. The shame of being an addict. For me, the constant failures, the relapses, the same cycle over and over again. Then becomes self-hatred. And then, what always comes is the shame. 

Knowing a lot of addicts, a lot in my family, I know for certain that a vast majority of them are sensitive, beautiful souls. Confused by the ways of this world... and trying to escape it by any means necessary. Drugs are a solution that brings relief, yet is a lie. 

I just wanted to let anyone struggling with shame, depression, anxiety, self-doubt, and self-hatred.... It isn't true. Because ultimately, the ways of this world are really a trick. To beat you down. The external measurements of what a complete human being is, like money, success, career, attractive looks.... This is a fallacy, hence why you see millionaires, the ones who ""had it all"" commit suicide. And simpler people like us who fall into this place because we simply don't think we are good enough based on these external measurements. 

Addiction has shown me that the external things, and the internal voice that brings pain is a liar. The shame is a liar. 

You're good enough. You are a beautiful soul. And you have the iron balls to go through one of the most brutal things on this planet. If anything, you are a fucking beast and courageous. You are a fighting spirit trying to escape the grasps of this evil. 

I obviously don't have everything figured out. But one thing is for certain. When I see how people show love on here, it is absolute confirmation that what I believe about most addicts is true. You are beautiful. You show love. You support those who you do not even know. And to me, that means the most in this life. All the other BS that everyone measures people by is ridiculous.  Be proud of how sensitive and beautiful you are. Because that is absolutely rare in this world. 

I would rather be with beautiful addicts than shitty people who live of this world. 

Steel is forged with fire. Let's walk through the fire. Then let's hold someone's hand while they walk through it. On the other side is a life, not perfect, and hard. But with a win in the column of arguably the most difficult thing to do in this life. Beating addiction.

I started by cutting every one of my many, many daily doses by 2g, waited a few days, then once I leveled out I cut again by 1g, so on and so on. I felt pretty bad withdrawals, even though I'm not going CT. My body and mind was SCREAMING for more Kratom (at first), but slowly the cravings went down. I am thankful for that. The first 3 nights I slept 2 hours per night, and on the 4th night I slept ZERO. It was horrible, but luckily I had a few days off work in a row. I just kept myself busy around the house, laid around a lot between small chores, and did my best to stay in a good headspace. My body is feeling so much better just from cutting down, and my mind's 'fog' has lifted a bit. So far, so good.


Another helpful thing I did was to make a spreadsheet in Google Docs. Broke it down by day and by dose, so I could see the taper all at once, as well as plan out the trajectory for quitting altogether. I think that maybe I went a little TOO fast at first, so I think I am going to slow my taper just a bit, while keeping a downward trend going. Might just add a day or two between steps down.

2020-10-12 10:56:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/j9sd53/thankful/,Thankful,"I am on my second month of my slow taper. I am so close to being done but it seems the last little bit is the hardest. Before tapering I was taking 5, 000 packed pills of kratom twice daily for about 2 years. I was in SERIOUS denial that I was feeling crappy due to kratom. When I went on vacation and didn't pack kratom I had no idea my RLS, mental breakdowns and sleep problems were actually withdrawal. I think part of me didn't want to admit that this substance that makes me feel so good (for a short period of time) was the culprit. I thought there was something wrong with me. I took pregnancy tests, went to the doctors multiple times, got blood work done, checked for hypothyroidism or hormonal Imbalances and even went off my antidepressants thinking they were the culprit (that didn't go well). I was secretive about my use so didn't talk to anyone about it and suffered alone. After searching online for answers I finally found a reddit post from this group and finally found my answer! I wasn't going crazy and I wasn't alone. Looking back now I believe my lack of libido, decreased energy, brain fog and weight gain were from kratom. And my panic attacks, severe depression, anxiety and sleep problems were withdrawal. Wish me luck as I enter my last couple weeks of tapering, it's not going to be easy. Good luck to everyone who is going through withdrawal as well. Any advice from someone who has been through this appreciated too!",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977415800094604}"
2020-10-12 08:22:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/j9pw45/it_could_simply_be_dependance/,It could simply be dependance...,"It's day 15 CT. The physical symptoms are starting to subside and I can once again feel who I was, who I am. It's been an almost spiritual experience of reconnecting with the self and I've been ruthlessly introspective trying to understand what this journey of habituation and physical dependence has taught me. In short; I've come to a deep respect for the suffering we are all trying to mitigate collectively. I also bow to all of those strong enough to be here in an attempt to meet life head on. 

Here are a few conclusions I've come to that may shed additional light on the quittingkratom matter. I haven't seen similar accounts, so I thought I would add. 

 I've been using on and off for the past 3 years or so, but during lockdown the doses went up and became Swiss-like in their timely consistency. In the past, I've never had an issue pausing use. Weeks and months would go by before I happily returned to the cocktails. That was how I knew plant. But this time 'round I've altered my body's chemistry to the point of needing K for maintenance. Womp. 

Since I never applied the word ""addiction"" to any part of my life before, the new paradigm was remarkably scary. I now have something I can't stop using lest I want to be in brutal pain for foreseeable future. My perception of myself changed for the worse and this only catalyzed the guilt and shame of it all. 

7 days ago I was writhing in pain from the body aches and was at a terrible emotional low. This is the 3rd time I've tried kicking Kratom and by far the worst. (google kindling effect)  I tacitly accepted my new  moniker of ""addict"" and prepared for a life of PAWS and forever thinking about the one that got away; kratom. 

But the strange thing of it all was that I had no urge to use. Surely, I knew that a quick dose would finally allow me to sleep and remove all pain, and I even imagined myself doing so to see where I was in relation to the substance, but nothing came up. 

Days went by, the symptoms eased, and while I still can't  sleep nor thermoregulate, I feel at peace, still curious about why I don't desperately desire any Kratom. And hell, I've read ALL the accounts of people at day 150 still experiencing PAWS, so who knows where I'll be in a month. 

But to stay optimistic as well as aware of my own individual physiology, here's a musing about an alternate narrative of use and recovery - the body developed a physical dependence on a drug that was EXTREMELY effective in quelling anxiety, fear, stress, etc. I am grateful for what it was, but at a certain point of habituation, the initial positives were absent from use. Once past the hell of WD and reintroduction to a long-lost clarity of self, I think the use of the term ""addict"" as a forever-label could be detrimental to full recovery - meaning, I believe if I tell myself ""YOU CAN'T HAVE KRATOM"" every single day I would lose sight of the fact that I no longer need or want it. Also, without Kratom, the dialogue with the heart gains an enormous amount of resolution and I can more easily see what aspects of my life I was afraid to confront. What are you not willing to feel?

As a control, I don't think I'll be touching Kratom for a very long time. I don't trust myself yet and all the above could be a crock of shit as well as simple rationalization to leave the door slightly ajar for future consumption. But alora, such are the challenges of this life. 

PS: thank you for your stories. I read a ""grapes of wrath"" worth and wouldn't be where I'm at if it weren't for you all.

2020-10-12 04:33:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/j9n5wa/whats_been_working_for_me_this_time_arround/,What's been working for me this time arround.,"3rd year on kratom. Most days 30-45gpd but had many bad days at 60+. Eventually it stopped working and only made me feel normal for an hour until terrible debilitating anxiety and running to shove more green powder down my throat. Lost track of how many times I tried to quit. This time here's what's been working out for me this time. 
1. I take a sleeping pill first thing in the morning. I was waking up at 6 am miserable only to take a dose that just put me to sleep so I figured trazadone instead would not only cut out a dose but also teach my brain it will not be rewarded for waking me up before I want to be up. I'm lucky and can use diphenhydramine and doxylamine succinate without the rls getting worse so I use that too on a rotation.
2. Agmatine. I take 1gram in the morning with the sleeping pill and .5g before each of my my 2 before-work doses. It keeps the awful withdrawal feeling away for an extra bit of time and it blunts the euphoric effects so I'm battling the psychological addiction twice as hard. 
3. DXM. 30mg in the morning before my first dose. It seems to do the same thing as the agmatine for me longer less euphoric highs. 
4. Lunchables. I eat one before every other dose. I was starving myself to get stronger but shorter highs. A lunchable isn't enough food as to where the kratom won't kick for 2+ hours if at all. I wait 20 or so extra minutes and it also makes the highs longer and less euphoric. 
5. THC+binging tv shows=1-4 hours of being able to procrastinate or if I'm lucky skip a dose it I'm not working. 
6. Accountability. I started a group chat with my brothers to hold me accountable. I also posted here when I started the taper after being a long time lurker. I love all of you! Special shout out to all the redditors who told me about these hacks! 
6. Prayer. I found a 54 day miracle novena and figured Id need a miracle and I genuinely believe it's helping a ton. I record the number of days in a row next to where I record my daily dose and I love watching one number slowly get higher as I watch one number get lower. 
With these 6 things it's been an easier taper than im used to. I feel like I'm stabalizing faster, don't know if it's my mindset or the dxm+agmatine. By taking just enough to keep away the worst of the withdrawal or enough to stay productive at work I feel pretty stable at 22gpd and it's only been 6 days. I'm prepared to have to make slower drops as I progress if need be. With previous taper attempts I usually mess up when kratom starts to feel really good again and one day of a couple extra grams turns to 2-3 tablespoons at a time every 2-3 hours and not weighing it so I don't feel too guilty. People who have successfully dropped give me tips on how to stay on the taper when it starts feeling good again. Thank you all I love you all!",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99883633852005}"

Wow, it has been almost 2 months now since I found this sub and got serious with myself about needing to quit kratom. Once I did, I decided to make a plan, set a quit date and start tapering. 5 weeks ago I jumped off my taper (I had been using 20-30gpd for 7 months). 

It feels so, so good not to be dependent on something to the point where I physically can't go about my  normal life if I don't take it. 

It's so nice to take full responsibility for my accomplishments instead of feeling like my behavior or performance was artificially enhanced.

It feels amazing to roll with the natural highs and lows of life instead of having my emotions regulated by a substance. It's great to feel the euphoria of rocking out to my favorite songs or laughing with friends. It's nice to cry again even. 

My mind and skin are so clear!

I am still dealing with a bit of PAWS but it's not debilitating anymore. I will never forget what I had to go through to quit this shit, and I will be staying close to this sub and posting here because the temptation to take it again is always there, and I by no means think I'm above being tricked by my mind.

I know it gets said a lot in this thread but it's true, it really is better on the other side. Whatever your situation is with kratom, however fucked and hopeless and painful it feels, there is a way. If it's important to you to quit, find that way and stick to it, no matter how long it takes.

I recently decided to kick the kratom as it seemed like it was starting to really mess up my digestive track. I'm a few days in and it's been extremely difficult. I'm not getting any RLS but I can't sleep more than 2-3 hours a night and the worst part is my stomach is a mess. I feel like I'm constipated but I'm not really, still passing BM's. I have no appetite and my stomach always feels like it's tied in knots. I'm already skinny and the prospect of losing more weight is really messing with my mentality.

If anyone has any recommendations to help me get through this I would greatly appreciate it. I'm supposed to go back to work Tuesday and as of now I just don't feel like I can handle it.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993852376937866}"

I’ve made a lot of progress since my last post. I started tapering off kratom around September 20th. I was taking 25gpd and now I’m down to 4gpd. I’ve been taking kratom everyday for 5 years. My quit date is November 1st. During this taper I’ve had some serious insomnia and fatigue, but it’s been very manageable. My worst fear was showing up to work having withdrawals, but honestly work has been great for withdrawals. When I’m at work I’m moving around and staying busy and it’s keeping my mind off the withdrawals. The worst part is going to sleep at night knowing I’m going to be tossing and turning. I usually only get around 2 to 4 hours of sleep a night. Another thing I’ve noticed is that I’ve become very emotional. I cry when friends and family show me support. I’m becoming less numb and I’m starting to feel again and it is a beautiful feeling. I’m starting to get my sex drive back which is the main reason I decided to quit kratom to begin with.

For the people that are not there yet, YOU WILL GET THERE. I was so fed up with avoiding responsibilities that I made this work for me and jezus if you're going through this whole withdrawal process right now, I wish you nothing but the best. This is so incredibly hard because of the physical and mental withdrawal, the latter being the worst for me. 
I'm fully recovered from kratom now. I'll never go back to that shithole again, because I was sugarcoating life for myself. What I've learned now is that my greatest goal in life should be learning as much as possible. I'm sorry if this sounds a bit far fetched and mostly principal instead of being actual advice, but I haven't quit my addictions yet. I moved over to weed and cigarettes. You could argue that this is worse than kratom and I'd agree, but the frequency is less.
What I'm trying to say is that I created this shithole. I created my own coping mechanisms. I'm fully responsible for the way I deal with things. I don't know about y'all life goals, but I'm pretty certain about mine. I like learning; from people, books, experiences etc. Being addicted to anything like a drug, kratom, alcohol, weed, whatever, it interferes with my life goal and it most probably does with yours as well. 
So I want to stop. The main reason being curiosity how it would increase my ability to focus on learning, self care etc. I've told my friends and roommates this dozens of times before and never really follow through. I rolled from kratom right into weed and it feels the same; I feel shackled by my unhealthy coping mechanisms, so I'm gonna stop smoking weed, drinking alcohol, masturbating to porno and rewarding my self with things that shouldn't be a reward. 

I hope you might get some motivation out of this. Be kind to yourself, this doesn't have to apply to you right now or ever, but don't stop fighting for your life goals because something you once did/do has you shackled. You're accountable for your own actions and in time, less being better than more, you should own up to your responsibility.",9,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7791339755058289}"

I’ve definitely felt dumb and guilty and everyone here pretty much mentions that. It’s a strange thing. You put this work and effort into getting OUT of the cloud. During withdrawal, some of that IS artificial but it’s natural. When you’re out of it, Instead of being able to fully enjoy your new life, you simultaneously feel guilty for the chunk of life you let slip away. 

But, a lot of us with dependency issues aren’t the cheeriest bunch in first place. Not everyone without dependency issues are the cheeriest bunch either. Sometimes the only separation between people is non-blissful ignorance. 

But, sometimes you gotta go through the cloud to come out on the other side to remember what you had. Because when you start on a substance...it’s your life PLUS that. But eventually it’s your life MINUS that. 

Especially currently, while I was leaning on Kratom as a distraction, it was most certainly amplifying my stresses. 

And you might have to quit a few times to truly be able to recognize that, but still, if you’re here you know it’s not sustainable. 

And I started listening to one of my favorite bands more this week, Foals. And hot damn if it’s not emotional. 

Course the last half hour I started jamming some Foals, playing guitar. I started sweating, which I haven’t done much this week. But I did take some gas station ephedra, magnesium, caffeine pills so there’s that. 😅

I was introduced to kratom at a kava bar by chance of talking to the folks next to me who happened to be vendors. I have a history with pain pills and alcohol. At first, kratom was a comforting, and familiar buzz. I took it in the evenings instead of drinking, and thoroughly enjoyed the buzz. That got to be a regular habit, and quickly became a daily routine. 

After so long of taking kratom I had no urge to drink alcohol. I would drink socially when going out on the weekends, but got to the point where kratom was the buzz I craved. That craving turned to dependency in a lot of ways. I started noticing feeling ill, among other effects, if I didn't dose. Dosing got more regular, and eventually I was on a pretty strict regiment. Basically wake up, drink a coffee, take kratom before I head out, kratom at lunch, kratom in the evening, booster dose later in the evening, and occasionally 1-2 booster doses throughout the day. 

COVID came along and I was working from home. Stuck in my house with a partner that I no longer felt in love with.. loss of interest in things I was once passionate about.. time for a change, and what better timing to go through withdrawals when working from home. Thanks COVID 😊 

I'll just say that the withdrawals suck, but are manageable. The first 4 days were the worst. I kept telling myself ""future you will thank you"" anytime I really struggled. Nights 3 and 4 were miserable, but the days were manageable. Black seed oil did seem to alleviate cravings during the day. RLS at night was bad...  Future me is very proud for getting through it.

Beginning the first night I felt emotional.. like crying from negative and positive thoughts. I suddenly felt music again.. music and showers were what made my days worth it. That normalized after about a week for me. I feel like I came out on the other end with a greater appreciation for music though. I guess that was the beginning of PAWS in my case? I ended things with the girl I was living with for 6 years, so that was a giant factor in my emotions. 

After a week, maybe 10 days, I was back to craving alcohol. Normalcy was back at about 2 weeks. One exception: digestive symptoms. I had symptoms of IBS for about 2 months. I'm sure stress from the breakup, living alone for the first time, new job amidst a pandemic, and alcohol made it far worse.

Looking back I know I could have quit sooner. So fucking glad I did it. I just woke up and decided today was the day on April 6th.  One of the biggest hurdles I've conqured. I wish the few people I've shared this with really understood, but I think it gets lessened since those conversations involve introducing them to what kratom is. 

I hope this inspires you to quit. If you are going through the quitting process, then I hope you know people understand and relate to what you are going through. It is worth it, and future you WILL thank you.",44,"{'covid': 2, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5714472532272339}"

For a while the fatigue and anxiety (panic attacks, chest pain, high HR) were unbearable but those are much better now. But I still have a hard time drinking coffee (1.5 cups in the morning, 30g of grounds). Without fail it always sends me into a panic around noon-1pm. Full disclosure, sometimes I don’t eat until around then either. Still, even when I do eat, coffee seems to give me more anxiety problems than before kratom. 

Anyone have any experience with this/know if I’ll get my tolerance for stimulants/caffeine back? Is that the issue? I saw someone else say it’s a low tolerance due to adrenal fatigue. I’ve been taking adrenal drops for the last month and a half or so and that definitely helps, but maybe not enough for me to drink coffee yet. I just miss coffee man tell me it’ll be ok

32 days now since my last kratom dose. I had to come back and say looking back there is a distinct difference in that 14 day mark.  Obviously the first week is tough for the physical elements. Transitioning between week 2 and 3 is where the mental aspect of do I try taking a little has a strong urge.

I wanted to post two days ago on Wednesday. I can say I was on a week long streak of feeling happy and energized. Then right on the 30 day mark I woke up just hating the world. Bad mood city. The whole day was me wanting to just get back to bed and sleep it off. The other part of me was remember the days when you could take some Kratom and your mood would be right where you want it.

This was quite a mind F&&& realizing how habitually I was thinking just take some kratom to make your day better. This was the first time I thought I'm in the clear of Kratom and happy going on a week....but then here is a bad day. How can I escape? 

Then I kept telling myself. People have bad days. You feel off. It happens. Taking a substance isn't the answer.  

Woke up Thursday morning and had a smile back on my face.  

Out of all the supplements we talk about I'd say two have been important to me forging ahead.

Black Seed Oil - this has done great with the anxiety and keeping me slightly calm on the bad days.

Noopept - The lack of energy from quitting Kratom really sucks. Caffeine does nothing but make one anxious. Noopept is the one thing that can give me some stimulation, a clearer head, and without the anxiety. I allow myself now to use it 1 day on and two days off. Best ROI is sublingual. 10 mg under the tongue. Let the powder sit in your mouth, no swallowing, for 10 minutes. its bitter but twenty minutes later energy and motivation are up. 

Is everything perfect.....nope. Sleep still difficult. Appetite goes in and out. I do miss that crutch called Kratom as I know how it can make a few hours seem easier. But having those hard long term goals of holidays without kratom is pushing me onwards to not give up.

I decided I would use it a lil bit to quit my kratom habit of 30 to 40 gpd over a 1 year period. I did manage to quit and use phenibut occasionally once a week. That turned into taking a lil bit of kratom while on phenibut to feel a euphoria I can't only explain as magical on the first try. Slowly but surely this became my new addiction. Wake up take phenibut then take kratom 2 times a day. Then it became take phenibut and kratom 2 times a day. Then by March covid19 hit and I lost my job. Being at home bored I started uping my doses on phenibut. I started with 1 gram but by the time I realized I was taking anywhere frm 4 to 8 grams a day. I'm an outdoorsman so I would leave my city and head to the mountains taking phenibut and kratom trying to get my mind off of losing my job and the virus. I didn't get any unemployment so I started using more and more from my anxiety. I started getting real bad stomach cramps, stomach burning from upper right abdominal area to the middle. Horrible nights of pain anxiety and realization of me slowly dieing. At this point I got called back to work with a heavy addiction in June. I had no choice but to continue work with a full blown addiction to high doses of both substances. The pain and anxiety would go hand in hand. I managed to go to work while being on phenibut and kratom everyday. But the pain and anxiety was catching up to me. 1 week ago I decided enough. I stopped cold turkey both substances. On last Friday I took my last doses went to a local river with my dog and enjoyed my day knowing this could be my last day enjoying anything for a while. Starting Saturday I've been off of both substances and I can truly say today is the first morning I woke up feeling a lil okay to actually sign up to reddit and post. My stomach pain was the worst part of the withdrawal. I jacked up my insides for sure. I lost 15 lbs during this last week by stress withdrawal and not being able to eat anything because of my pain. It was truly killing me. I did take a week off work to be able to do this. I took some clonidine and dlpa for easy my withdrawals. I've been tru hell and back. Still struggling but guys these are two addiction plus my stomach pain I've been dealing with and I managed to stop it. You guys going through this I feel your pain. Hope you guys see the light at the end of this. One day you'll wake up just like me and realize things aren't so bad. You'll probably thank God you've made it this far.

Interesting way to start the day, lol.   As I was driving i was seeing the people in the other lane of traffic passing by and there faces morphed into cat faces and weird shit like that.  My heart was beating out of my chest and a weird tingly feeling similar to when you take too much niacin (pins and needles and slight burning sensation).  After about 30 mins sitting at a  gas station I pysched myself up to just go to work and push thru it.  So I put my sunglasses, hat and mask on and drove to the first job.  (I work outside pressure washing.  A crazy old lady as the first customer took the edge off, thank god.  Hallucinations didnt last long but a general sense of of impending doom lingered all day, unfortuntaley.  

Anyways, i underestimated how strong Memantine would be.  It definitely took away all cravings for K but also bestowed me with zero appetite, no need for sleep, tons of anxiety/feelings impending doom and just all around negative feelings from Memantine.  As of today (the next day) I still fell ""raw"" like someone pulled a band aid off my brain.  Kinda like the next few days after taking ayahuasca theres tgus wierd spaced out and dissociated depersinalized feeling.

  I cant believe they give this to old people!   That's wild, but maybe I just took too much or the other supps potentiated it plus I have a history of mental health issues but it always seems to come from drugs.

  Lesson learned tho.  The drugs the pharmaceutical companies cook up are always as strong or stronger than ""street drugs"" IME.  

Lifes a wild ride and I definitely got more than I bargained for but to be honest I had it coming.  You make your bed and you gotta sleep in it.  Zero regrets and it was interesting to go on that ride but I'm not sure I'll be buying another ticket.

I went 50 days.... 50 DAYS CT and then something awful happened: my brother (suffers from mental illness and is a poly drug user) overdosed (he's alright because of narcan, but it was so traumatic on my parents) and I needed to pack up my life and fly across the country to be with them. Even after 50 days, I was so lethargic and just did the bare minimum to get by. I relapsed.

Ive lurked here for a long time wondering if and when I should ever quit. That decision was made for me Saturday 9/26 when my girlfriend caught me taking a dose when I had said months ago that I didnt take Kratom anymore. She gave me an ultimatum: Kratom or Her.
It was a no brainer. Kratom only made me feel shitty. It dampened everything in a negative way. I had been suffering from crippling depression and anxiety for over a year and couldnt put my finger on it. It was all so clear: I didn't need to take antidepressants, I needed to stop TAKING a depressant. 
24-72 hours were the worst. I was sick as a dog but luckily my family, friends and girlfriend rallied around me and helped me through it. Exercise was key here. I was amazed how riding my bike or walking would take 90% of the symptoms away. Even with lack of sleep I try to at least get a chill bike ride in daily. Sweat everyday if possible. 
When my appetite finally came back I made sure to eat as wholesome and clean as possible. 
I feel like Ive woken up from a 3 year long bad dream. It hasn't been 2 weeks yet and I feel like a completely different man. I have my vigor back, I feel vivacious and I want to grab life by the horns and realize what it has to offer. Music sounds amazing again. Im chatty again. I love my job again. My girlfriend is in love with the real me again!! I am so glad I did this. 
There is true life on the other side. I know I may be riding a wave but I want to ride this as far inland as possible. Sleep is still tough and diarrhea is constant. Otherwise doing well. Good luck all, just remember it is worth it. I will report back with any updates. Watching out for PAWS....",29,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9764460325241089}"

I'm on day three (day 4 starts tomorrow at 10am) and I'm actually feeling surprisingly well. I'm not perfect, but the hot/cold swings have seemed to really subside substantially. I know the big test will be tonight if I can actually get some sleep in, but I'm not going to expect it just to let myself down. So, I know everyone has different reactions to withdrawal times...some are faster than others. As for myself, I have only abused Kratom to the extent of 30gpd within the past 6 months. I've been using for a year and a half, but I was probably doing around 15-20gpd before the covid hit. I'm just wondering if maybe my ""high dose"" timeframe was short enough to significantly reduce the duration of my withdrawal? I'm already planning a vacation with my wife this weekend, and I feel extremely confident that it will play out fine. Has anyone else had this experience of quick recovery?
I just started taking kava today to help, but I have only used it twice so far. The last one is for sleep. If my symptoms are much better tomorrow again, I'm going to reduce that as well.

I have an update on my progress as well as a few tips and pointers i've learned along the way. I'm sure some of it is old news or has been rehashed a million times, but my flavor is my own and so here it goes.

Today is Day 26 sober from Kratom (as well as methamphetamines, heroin, alcohol and cigarettes), as well as being Day 40 sober from marijuana. Now to be completely honest with myself and the community, I did smoke 3 cigarettes and had a 16 oz. alcoholic cider on Day 23, and a 10g dose of Dark Brown Bantuagie kratom on Day 20 (just to see how it would effect me and to get some sleep). Other than that I have been sober as a freaking whistle folks.

My biggest struggles were from Day 7-14; the restlessness and general body pains were almost unbearable. I tried Tylenol PM, Hyland's Restful Legs and Restful Legs PM, Melatonin and vigorous exercise. For the most part, those things worsened RLS and were not long-term solutions. Lo and behold the magnificent panacea which is Magenesium bisglycinate. I have used this for the past two days with unwavering success. You can get this at WalMart for $6; make sure to review the back of the label as the 'bisglycinate chelate' will not be mentioned on the front of the bottle.

As far as body pains, Oreganol Oil has been a tremendous help. I do not take it every day, but its worthwhile to take 3-5 days out of the week. My brother, who is a biochemist at a local biotech firm, brought me some goodies from his lab to help me with my journey last night. One of those was Nigella sativa (Black Seed oil powder), which I have just learned is an indirect mu-opioid agonist and an effective antinociceptive ([http://www.ayubmed.edu.pk/JAMC/PAST/20-2/Sangi.pdf](http://www.ayubmed.edu.pk/JAMC/PAST/20-2/Sangi.pdf)). I also tried a blend of L-Theanine, GABA, Ashwaganda and Kava, in a pre-formulated blend I bought in LA years ago, which helped quite a bit.

As far as other avenues that might help - your favorite movies, music, hobbies and weight lifting/running have been essential. Although, after twenty years of substance abuse of every sort and manner, my anhedonia is not even thinking of leaving me yet, but its a work-in-progress and will take some time to recover.

First off, I know this is recommended against, however I am looking for a little clarification. I have read many accounts of people using Naltrexone to induce precipitated withdrawals from strong opiates, and opioids including Kratom... however, the accounts with Kratom seem to be from people who were consuming 25GPD or more. At this dose, I wouldn't imagine doing this.

I am only taking \~6GPD. Based on what I see here, that's a very minor amount of Kratom.

I would like to attempt this in order to get this all over with as fast as possible, and in my possession I have Lyrica (same type of drug as Gabapentin), as well as clonidine, and clonazepam. If I were to do this with these comfort meds to fall back on, do you think this would be manageable? Also, how quickly would the acute symptoms last?

I know it's difficult to say, but any idea what level of hell I would be transported to if I took the Naltrexone? I'm considering this mainly because I got to 8 days the last attempt, and although the withdrawals never really got bad (VERY minor RLS in just the morning), they also didn't seem to be improving at day 8. I'd much rather ""rip the band-aide RIGHT OFF"" - so to speak.

I stopped using kratom around the beginning of march (this year) after tapering down to 1 gpd. The withdrawal was as bad as you'd think, I was a zombie in hell for about the first 2 weeks. foolishly I used oxycodone a few weeks after that not thinking it would reset the withdrawal. After a week of use I CT'd from everything. completely sober, and went through a slightly less painful version of the first zombie hell. Since then its been over 150 days (I've lost count) and I've been completely sober from all substances except matcha green tea. The withdrawal definitely lessened as time went by, but every single day I've had at least one symptom. Every day includes a yawning fit at some point. Some days I'm great and I feel like I should, and then some days I feel depressed and have muscle aches. It's especially frustrating because I can go maybe 2-3 days feeling good, then boom the next day im depressed, yawning and aching.

TBH the acutes never really hit me that hard physically (pain/achiness). It was the insomnia that was by far the worst, which I feel like just exacerbated any other withdrawal symptom (like restlessness, agitation, anhedonia, etc.). After about day 8 or so, the insomnia was completely gone with the simple use of melatonin. Do not, I repeat, DO NOT take Benadryl to fall asleep or you will be up all night wondering why you even bother laying down.

At this point, I'm feeling mini-PAWS. I don't have any anxiety/depression, but more slight anhedonia and lethargy. Yesterday, my girlfriend asked if I wanted to go on a walk. This is something I would have probably never agreed to before because, well, spontaneity gets in the way when on the K.  To my own surprise I said, ""what the heck!"" and went on a walk. We ended up stopping by a Mexican restaurant and had appetizers. This is something to cherish during times of low-pleasure. My girlfriend was so happy to just get out with me on a whim and go get some apps. Even though it is still hard to outwardly show my enthusiasm to her, I actually felt really good inside for just making her happy like that.

As of now, it's just a battle of the mind. It's understanding that what I'm experiencing will continue to improve over time. There will be good days and bad days; sunshine and rain. But like Spring, each day is closer to Summer weather (metaphorically).

I'm someone who was an athlete for the majority of my life, but then stopped working out in my early adult years. I'm still in good body shape at 29 years old (6'1 - 160lbs), but I know my next step is getting back into being physically active. Unfortunately, I (like many of us) are stuck in a catch-22 of: Exercise will likely make you feel way better, but finding the motivation to begin in the first place is extraordinarily hard.

Either way, I've mastered the art of telling cravings to kick rocks. Do I want to feel euphoric on Kratom again? Hell yeah I do, that's why people relapse. Am I going to do it? Hell no I won't, because that's how we ended up here in the first place.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9882118105888367}"

I find that it helps me with my anxiety and low energy but I HATE being dependent on it and I also hate the hair loss so much.

Honestly the worst wd symptoms I've ever experienced and I've done em all...,"So I recently bought some 70% Kava Extract from a guy on a well known online market place for arts and crafts (not sure if I can share where) after getting a sample with some BL 100:1 Extract and was quite surprised and amused with the drunken and euphoric feeling I got roughly 2 hours after taking two capsules.    
.  
Since then I have taken Kava about every other day (with no more than 3 pills at one time) and noticed that the second dose had far different effects from the original (as I soon found out is because it has an accumulated effect).   
.  
The second dose of two capsules was similar to hypomania. For those who haven't experienced hypomania it feels kind of like natural speed. A more consise way to sum up the effects was similar to a stimulant with a unique sedating effect. I was extremely talkative and engaged in conversation, able to get more work done along with taking less of my anti anxiety medication along with my medication to nerve pain.  
.  
I have not noticed any tolerance to the drug as I have taken it for multiple days in a row and usually with become immune to the effects of any drug (besides salvia) if taken more than once a week.   
.  
Another amazing thing I find about Kava is that unlike literally every Gaba A receptor antagonist I have only came across one post discussing it but the OP had already done major damage to his Gaba receptors via benzos and chronic alcohol abuse. Just like with tolerance I would have also noticed the initial rebound effect in regards to anxiety or the initial uncomfortable heat/ burning sensation I always get when having missed a dose of Gabapentin or Diazepam.  
.  
.  
Anywho, I am curious as to whether or not anyone out there has experienced these types of effects or any highly notable effects whatsoever.  

.

When my wife took h er first two pills she felt nothing but a few days later she took three and noticed mild sedation and mood lift which is mostly what I find when researching the effects of Kava Kava in relation to tea. She was however also EXTREMELY easy to make laugh although she didn't notice this herself.  

Both of us experienced mild itchiness which personally I enjoyed and did not bother her. My skin is also improving in regards to mild psoriasis.  

.  

TL;DR experienced significant mood lift, decreased anxiety, nerve pain and MDMA like enjoyment during conversation from taking 2-3 70% Kava Extract Capsules.",2,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8004734516143799}"

I am going to Quit CT,"A Google search of Tinnitus and Kratom brought me to this subreddit.  Holy crap, after searching this subreddit for tinnitus I can't believe Kratom could be the main source to my ears ringing!!  I thought it was from my loud window AC behind my bed, but there are quite a few people here who are experience ringing in their ears from K abuse.

Are there others here that have noticed their ears ringing, and significantly getting worse while abusing K for years?  Along with Tinnitus, my right ear is plugged up and sounds muffled at times.  I went to urgent care as I thought I had an ear infection, but the Dr said my ears were clear.  Was told to take sudafed.  4 days later, my ear is still clogged and not getting any better.  Anyone else have clogged ears as well??

My quick story:  I am 33 years old.  Around 3-4 years ago, a friend told me about how much energy and euphoria K gives them so I tried it.  Man oh man, I fell in love with it.  I used it only on my days off from work, for a speedy feeling to focus playing video games.  Fast forward to today, I've been using multiple times a day.  I lost my job due to covid and have nothing better to do besides lay in my bed literally all day, take K and play games.  (My room is a mess, I'm lazy, I shower once a week, I just want to take K, drink a case of diet coke, and smoke cigs all day long.)

As to my dosage, I don't know how many grams...I usually start a big spoonful, then another one an hour later, then many many more smaller spoonfuls (at least 1-2 an HR) throughout the next 8-12 hours to keep my buzz going.  

That's pretty much my story.  I have been abusing K bad since March and after browsing this subreddit, I think I'm going to Quit CT for good!!  I'm 33, too young to have hearing problems!  I've gone a few days here and there without using and did experience bad headaches, withdrawl symptoms, etc etc.  

My main issue right now is severe ear ringing!  It is very noticeable and is freaking me out.  Also my right ear feels plugged and no matter what I do, I googled self treatment, Nothing will make the ringing go away.  I really really hope the ringing is from K use and will get better over time.  I see my Reg doctor Thursday and will tell her about my K use and health problems.  I have also been sleeping like crap lately.  Im lucky if I get 2 hours of sleep at a time without waking up and having trouble falling back to sleep 

My last dose was 4 hours ago.  I'm quitting CT starting now!  I hope it's a fast recovery.  Thanks for reading and letting me blab!",2,"{'infect': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990037083625793}"

Like many of you, I've just decided to stop Kratom. It's a funny story how I came to realise that this stuff is utter garbage... I went to the hairdresser, and got my usual high and tight...the hairdresser (an old Korean lady) said to me, ""if I cut it any shorter, your bald spots will show"". I thought she was crazy, I've always had thick hair and no one on either side of my parents family is bald. Well, holy crap, sure enough, my hair was extremely thin and there were patches of hair missing. I remembered reading a while ago that this was a side effect of Kratom, but I didn't believe it. When I came home, my wife and I dumped our each of the 4 bags I had into the dumpster (yesterday around 10 am).
I really never go on Reddit, but I found this group and I've read some amazing stories. Last night, as expected was absolute hell. I felt like I had bugs crawling all over my joints and I just could not stop moving. I called out of work and finally got some sleep. Right now, the symptoms are much milder than I thought they would be, but they're still really annoying (restless arms and legs...and about every other joint in my body). Aside from that though, I'm actually feeling fine mentally. I started using Kratom in June sof 2019... So I've taken it for almost a year and a half. Since January, I was probably taking about 20-30gpd. I'm not sure what constitutes as ""heavy use"" or ""long term use"", but given the information provided, I was wondering if there was anyone out there that could tell me what to expect.

I’ve been using for over a year and a half with a 18 to 20g per day habit. I was a painkiller addict for about 6 years until I found Kratom. I thought Kratom saved my life but instead I just traded one substance abuse for the other. Now I’m experiencing crazy health symptoms, terrible hair loss, weight loss due to complete lack of appetite, no sex drive, I’m nauseous all the time. Constipated. I went to the doctors and had blood work done, they couldn’t find anything, and now I believe it’s due to the Kratom. I’m sick of living my life in slavery to a substance. I want my life back. My husband knows I take kratom but doesn’t know how much. I plan on telling him when I’m ready to go CT. 

Right now I’m trying to taper, cutting 1/8 of a teaspoon from each dose every 5 days to a week until I’m at about 3g per dose then I might just go cold turkey. I haven’t tried taking any supplements but just cutting my doses by that little is bringing on withdrawal symptoms. Runny nose, anxiety, depression, insomnia. Today was day 3 and it was a little better but am I going to experience this every time I cut my dose? Maybe I should just go CT and get it over with?

I have been struggling with kratom for 3 years the past 2 have been 30-40gpd. I always reach a point where I the kratom doesn't work it just keeps the withdrawal away for an hour then the extreme anxiety kicks in. I then taper feel better and arround 10gpd the kratom starts working again then I relapse. I am starting this taper at 25gpd and am going to work my way down from there. I really really want to be down to arround 15gpd as soon as possible as that's when I start to feel better. My question to all of you is is there a way to speed up the time my body takes to stabalize? I can't handle my mental state right now its is in the trash and I can barely function (maybe I'm extra sensitive with this chemical). I read somewhere that agmatine will potentate the kratom so I can taper quicker and speeds up the time it takes for me to stabalize but all I noticed the agmatine blunted the euphoric effects. Is there anything else that can speed me down to 15 then I can slow down the taper? Thanks for any advice I love all of you.,11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9956696033477783}"

I wasn't using a lot compared to others on this board, usually 1.5 tsp once or twice a day which I estimate would be 7.5-14 gpd? I wasn't using kratom for very long either, only since August, but I was using it to get off a mild opiate problem.

I toughed it through some crazy panic attacks over the weekend which my Dr did give me a prescription for ativan for (but I choose to use sparingly because I am not about to develop a benzo addiction). I also have a gabapentin prescription I use for chronic back pain (that got me on the opiates on the first place yay... :/). Yesterday I thought I was doing much better. I managed to get some garage cleaning done and even logged in to play a little FFXIV last night and talk to a friend. Sleep was ok last night, but I woke up this morning with a huge brain zap I guess? Not sure what it was but it lasted awhile and was really uncomfortable. I also woke up in another panic attack which I thought was gradually improving. I also find that food still just does not taste good and I have little to no interest in eating. Is this the normal progression for Kratom withdrawal? I typically have depression and anxiety issues that I'm trying to worth through anyway, I'm just not sure if I'm still not escaped from the Kratom claws yet, or if its something else going on that I need to figure out. I guess I'm just curious as to when these symptoms are going to fade finally.

I would also prefer to use Kava over the Ativan, but I'm not sure how long to take that either since eventually I don't want to use anything to get through this.

An article I read says hair loss is not a common symptom in kratom users in other countries where the leaves are brewed for tea and chewed straight off the tree.

Adrenal fatigue and thyroid issues cause the kind of hair loss most of us posting on here mention. Also heavy metal poisoning can cause hair loss. It's just unfortunate that more studies haven't been done. Something in the kratom causing thyroid and/ or adrenal fatigue/stress reaction of hair continuing to fall out? It can't be because there is any kratom in my system 5 months later. I'm still having trouble eating and with anxiety/heat rushes. It would be great to go to a doctor about this but no insurance and hardly a job left. 

Most people on here have hair stop falling out after about 3 months. I guess I'm thinking most people's bodies start functioning normally again with kratom out of their system. Maybe some of us in less great health, older, been through the recovery ringer a time or 2 already have a longer time rebounding.

Rule Four – The lesson is repeated until learned. Lessons repeat until learned. What manifest as problems and challenges, irritations and frustrations are more lessons – they will repeat until you see them as such and learn from them. Your own awareness and your ability to change are requisites of executing this rule. Also fundamental is the acceptance that you are not a victim of fate or circumstance – ‘causality’ must be acknowledged; that is to say: things happen to you because of how you are and what you do.

I started a journal and wrote all the negative stuff I go through daily with Kratom. I do want to share some supplements I’m using, psyllium husk capsules for constipation. It works very very well. Also “olly” sleep vitamins. 
The main reason I want to quit is,
I am having some health problems, I thought it was lupus or immune disease. All blood work can back fine. I believe my symptoms are from Kratom use. Not to mention depression, low sex drive, hair loss, lack of interest etc. I’ve been using for 2 years about 20g daily I believe, more or less! When I first found out about Kratom I was super excited. I do have fibromyalgia and chronic pain. Which being in pain everyday is exhausted. So I will need to find something to help with daily pain probably cbd and exercise. It also helped me quit drinking alcohol which was a problem.

Before I kept the whole thing a secret because it was like in the back of my mind I knew that I could relapse and at least I wouldn't have to worry about feeling the shame and disappointment from those I had told.

Anyways, the first 4 days were hell as expected. Today was the first day I woke up feeling pretty good, it surprised me.   I slept like a champ last night, i think from exhaustion from barely getting any sleep the past couple of days.  I know today is not over yet and that I may end up getting smacked with the withdrawal pains later on this afternoon, but I'm just grateful for the small wins like finally having a good morning and a good nights sleep, and just grateful I've made it this far.

The powder had long stopped working and did (does) absolutely nothing for me. Eventually the shots did nothing for me. I hate that it took getting nothing from it, plus the absurdly embarrassing amount of money spent to make me drop the stuff, but here I am. Roughly, $1000 not spent in the last 25 days on THAT Brand’s shots.

It feels like this is a huge step for me. Before, if I walked into a store and saw it being sold, I bought it without question. I have very little, to zero, desire to pick that back up.

I've never posted on reddit before, but I found this group while searching for help getting off Kratom. I was sober in AA from 2010-2016 after a long, horrible span of many years. I drank at least 1/2 gallon of vodka every day for the last 4 years, along with tons of pills and other shit.

I'm a male who's always had great thick hair, but in recent months it looks dull and lifeless and even the stands looked thinner. I really try to take care of myself from a health standpoint and want to look good as long as possible. Not only what I mentioned previously, but it doesn't even make me feel good anymore.

Here's my story.,"I started taking Kratom about 2 years ago. I had a roommate who introduced me to it, and we would take 3g or so once a day and play video games together. It seemed like the perfect alternative to sitting around smoking weed; it gave me focus, a small boost of energy, and a general euphoric feeling that I really enjoyed.


Over the last couple of years, I slowly began upping my dosage and now I am sitting at about 40-48g per day. Not as much as some of the other people on this subreddit, but too much. I fear that I have become reliant on Kratom to maintain a steady mood, and have found myself 'hitting the bottle' whenever a stressful situation occurs. I find myself sneaking a dose at work, at home, and when I am on the road. I am ashamed to have to 'pack my doses' when I travel for work, or for when I drive across the city to visit a friend or relative.

Even worse, lately I have been waking up in the middle of the night with restless legs and cold sweats, resulting in taking a dose of Kratom to help me finish out the night's sleep. I never imagined I'd end up here, and I am ready to quit.

After doing some research I decided that tapering off would be much more doable than quitting cold turkey. I am going to start with lowering my dosage 20%, as the Tapering Guide suggests. The only question I have regarding that is for how long do I taper before I step down again? 1 day? A few days? A week? Longer? I wasn't sure and could use some guidance there. Today is the first day of that journey, and I can feel my palms sweating as I type this, coming to grips with reality that I can't continue to take as much as I want anymore. To be honest, I am terrified of the withdrawal symptoms, and hope that tapering down will help with those.

My friend who introduced me to Kratom has recently kicked, and he mentioned that CBD has helped in some way with his quitting. I don't want to necessarily replace one thing with another, but I do realize CBD isn't nearly as harmful as Kratom. Has anyone out there had any experience with this? I'd also like any other constructive criticism when it comes to kicking. I'm ready to do to this. I will continue to monitor this subreddit and read the links to the right. They've already been helpful in getting my mind right for the troubling days ahead. I can do this. I have a super supportive girlfriend who knows I take too much Kratom and wants me to stop, but I haven't had 'the talk' with her yet. I plan on doing that tonight. It's time. I just want to be a good partner, a good dad, a good friend, and a good employee to a job that I love, and am lucky to have.

Sure, being uncomfortable sucks and not sleeping sucks more, but it turns around on day 3.  The most important thing is to get exercise, stay busy, eat healthy, and drink a ton of water.  Surround yourself with positive people who support you, and if that is not an option, only stick to the POSITIVE posts in forums like these.

At first I wasn’t sure,  I could make it a week tbh. I have detoxed from harder opioids in the past so I had a good idea what I was in for. The physical effects for the acute withdrawal were very similar to opioids for me, but the severity of them were inconsistent for the first few days. The depression I felt from detoxing from opioids was much much more severe for me than kratom. After first few days of constantly telling myself no to kratom cravings, things became much easier and my confidence restored slightly. The second week was hard, but acutes were mild if not completely gone. I had quite a bit of mood swings, anxiety, and very low energy. Now where I’m at 20 days , I feel close to normal mentally and emotionally, just still have low energy levels. It is completely manageable tho, I can push through it. 

It is well worth stopping , after 5 days I still didn’t feel good, but I felt better than I did at the end of my kratom use. It isn’t necessarily going to take forever to feel better either. Hope this helps, I know this thread has helped me a lot , and I’m appreciative of it. Thanks",15,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9663959741592407}"

I can finally say I am close to feeling normal. My longest lasting symptoms are irregular heartbeat, PAWS (depression and panic attacks), exhaustion, back pain. 5 days ago I saw a hypnotherapist to focus on getting my sleep back. I was very skeptical but she is a friend who did it for free, and literally that night my sleep went from like 4-5 hours of broken sleep back to basically normal. Once I began sleeping again, my healing has progressed much more rapidly!

I have been in a very intensive training program the past 3 weeks, and despite having to take mini breaks to have crying attacks, I did well and finished everything! I accomplished a lot, and I did it sober without depending on kratom or anything else, and the natural euphoria from knowing that is far better than the fake temporary happiness of kratom.

I still think about kratom a lot, I miss leaning on it every time shit got a little rough. I'm hoping some of the cravings will fade with time but this first month has shown me that I am stronger than my addiction, and I'm proud of myself.

I love this sub so much and feel so much for all of you who are quitting right now. It is really, really hard. I don't regret quitting for a second, and can't wait for you to experience the awesomeness of being kratom-free.

I am on Day 20 since I last took K after a slow taper down to 2 gpd. Essentially been in subtle WD for months- but it was manageable and beats being on the sludge any day. Twice I tried CT and failed. All research and expert advice has showed tapering more successful and it was for me! I feel like I have energy, clarity and my full life back again! It sucked Days 1-14, but not once did I ever think about taking any. I have been 100% transparent with my doctor, therapist, friends and teen kids about my Kratom use and why I quit and will never go back. For me, the more people I share this with made all the difference. I had lots of support and feel like I’m over the hardest hurdle. I realize PAWS is always a possibility and prepared for such. I have gabapentin if I need it. This community has been key for me and I’m so grateful I can check in here whenever I need to and get what I need. Thank you!

My husband is now ready to taper down and get off. We are separated, so we don’t live together, but he’s asked me to hold his Kratom and give him doses. (I have zero interest in ever taking the nasty stuff again) He’s an alcoholic and in an outpatient program and attending multiple AA meetings a day via Zoom. I am happy to help him and glad he’s ready to quit this stuff and has the support of his therapist, doctor and group friends. 

 I slowly tapered for months and honesty can’t remember exactly how much and when I went down. What’s a good schedule that is not too long, not too short? Only interested in slow tapering, not CT.

I never measured my dose but was using atleast one 30 gram bag a day if not breaking into another bag when the first was empty. Quitting CT the first time around was horrible, I don’t even need to explain the hell that was withdrawal, we all get it here. So I decided to “taper” and than quit. Basically for the last year and a half I’ve been off and on using K, going through spells where I wouldn’t use and tried to manage my pains through healthier alternatives. I started to drink waaaay more water, I leaned heavily on smoking weed to help me with anxiety or the overall hopelessness that would swallow my mind, I stopped drinking coffee after 12:30 pm, and MOST IMPORTANTLY I started riding my bike vigorously. I was out of work at the time, so it was easy to have a regimented routine of wake up, drink coffee, ride my bike 10-20 miles come home, shower eat, apply
 For jobs for 5 hours, another bike ride, come home dinner, bed. But the bike riding helped tremendously, it allowed me to achieve some sort of restful sleep, got rid of the restless leg syndrome, and it also helped me lose weight and made me feel over all good and confident. I  cannot stress enough how important it is to push through that sluggish depression and achey feeling you get with quitting Kratom. Exercise is the cure, when your mind is telling you to do nothing and sit around feeling bad, if you go and force yourself into a grueling workout or looooong physically demanding exercise, it floods your brain with positive ness. But once I got a job and money started coming in, I caved and have been using half a 30 g bag a day for about 2-3 weeks now, and I need to stop now before my body adjusts and I’m back in the hot seat again. I have put on almost 20 pounds, have lost all of my creative drive or motivation, and become distant and annoyed by my family and friends. I don’t play mUsic, paint, or create anything anymore, my friends and family just aggravate me when I’m on Kratom, and kratom only blocks me from being truly happy and having fulfilling relationships and hobbies. I’m going to smoke a fat joint, hop on my bike, plug my earbuds in and blast my favorite music and ride till my legs fall off. 
Good luck everybody, sorry if this was confusing, I just woke up.
P.s: I choose bike riding because it was the easiest exercise for me to do. I don’t really enjoy running, weight lifting or going to the gym is not my style, so I choose something I enjoyed doin and pushed myself to go farther on each bike ride. Don’t give up, just do a little bit more, or go a bit farther every time you work out. You can and will get through it!!!",34,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.603100061416626}"

Even if it's just a placebo effect it's better than nothing, especially on days like today where the depression is just...well, you all know how it can be. So first of all I'm going to list what I have and what the bottles say are the recommended doses, which is what I was taking.

\- SAM-E:, 400 mg. 1 tablet between meals.

\- L-Tyrosine, 500 mg: 1 capsule daily.

\- Ashwagandha, 1950mg: Serving size is 3 capsule once daily,, so that's what I took.

\- L-Theanine, 200mg: 1-2 capsules daily (I've been taking one).

\- Black Seed Oil. No idea how much, but it says to take two capsules daily.

So I guess what my question is here is, are there any other essentials, and should I be taking more than what I've listed?

Day 1-2 were relatively easy for me.
I struggled to go to sleep at night due to akathisia-like symptoms, in spite of extra fatigue, but nothing too severe. I tossed and turned for maybe 2h and slept a solid 5-6h.

Day 3, the tingling sensations in my body were no longer confined till late in the evening, but all day, and I couldn’t seem to find peace in my body whatsoever. That night sleep was a total no-go in spite of trying. 

Day 4 I didn’t feel very tired in spite of no sleep, but rather spent the day feeling electric. Like there is a charge in me that wants out. More of the same, but stronger. That night I did struggle to sleep, but slept maybe 4 hours waking up roughly every half hour. 

Day 5 I went to work and functioned fine but still with same electric feeling. Slept very badly again. 

Day 6 is today and I am waiting to go to sleep. I took 5mg of diazepam to hopefully override some of the jittery symptoms and allow me to sleep. It was not a decision I took lightly, but I am getting a slight cold and I don’t want to have too many nights of minimal sleep as it’ll f with my immune system.

My question to you is, can you share with me, if you had these symptoms - how long can I expect to struggle with this feeling? 

My work is quite reliant on fine motor control and a calm mind and body, and so I’m optimistic this will pass in time. Any advise is welcome.

I am quitting kratom with attempt 4-5 now, the last attempt I was successful for over a month! I was not ready for the PAWS, I was also just dumb also to get back  into this green devil.  The human mind is a tough thing to control, but I am prepared, short term and long term. I am ready, I have trained for years for this final trial. It has changed my life for the worst but will change it for better, you don't know what you have till you lose it. I am taking 10g a day, I was taking 14g a day, gonna do a rapid taper 8g three days (night time only), then 5g three days and 2g three days, and jump.

Things that worked before for the short phase:

\- magnesium (400mg)

\- vitamin C 1g-2g

\- low dose DXM (30mg) NMDA receptor antagonist every 4-6 hours

\- agmatine ( 200mg) every 2-3 hours.

\- CDP-choline + phenylpiracetam (600mg & 200mg) when needed to do things or work.

\- xanax (if I can get some, for when I jump for sleep) 0.25 - 1mg

\- L-theanine + valerian root  + ashwagandha + melatonin, for sleep also.

&#x200B;

For long term, I need to get off of dxm when the short symptoms go away 7-14 days. (with taper for me usually 4-6 days). It can cause a tolerance. Phenylpiracetam is key, but will not be used every day. I just need to make it to the 90 days mark. I will chart my progress on this post, like last time. If you are taking the jump or tapering, please follow this post, and we can do it together. The people on this subreddit are amazing, and thank everyone on here! I will start tomorrow, wish all of us luck!

DAY 1 (tapering) 10/3/2020: doing ok, a bit RLS and gastro issues, but nothing that bad. I decided to take an additional 1g in the morning, but today will be the only day I do this. The D-.X.-M and agmatine is doing a good job like before. nothing horrible, another update tomorrow!

&#x200B;

DAY 2 (tapering) 10/4/2020: Really tired today, like stay in bed all day tired. I am not in full withdrawal till 11AM-noon, so probably just had a horrible night sleep. I can't wait in till all my emotions flood into my brain again, the pro is music is amazing! the con is sometimes I have that awkward feeling of being naked and get over emotional.

DAY 3 (tapering) 10/5/2020 UPDATE #1: Ok I should note, the phenylpiracetam is really keeping me up. I recommend to take 100-200mg phenylpiracetam with 250 mg of a good source of choline (CDP-choline or alpha-GPC) at like 9am, definitely before noon. I probably only got 3 hours of sleep tonight (morning now) with 300mg of phenylpiracetam at 4pm... not good. The interesting part is I feel kinda fine, I am sure that will change around noon, but just a fair warning. I will probably take 100mg phenylpiracetam around 10 am, so I am not too tired for work. This is just a minor update, will give update #2 tonight.

FUN FACT: coffee is an opioid receptor antagonist, so when tapering try to avoid coffee, it will lower your kratom effects. Don't want to dip too much or you have a higher risk of failing at your taper. ",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.990096926689148}"

So... I’ve been in the process of tapering from about 45 gpd for 6 years (with some quits in there).  I’m at 18.5 gpd now and plan to jump in 1 week, no matter what dose I get to by then. 

Anyways, I’ve use kava for many years as well and am quite experienced with it. In the past, when I quit, I tend to replace kratom with kava. I need to quit both, probably. I’m quitting kratom because it REALLY turned on me- crazy anxiety and depression that is unusual for me. I’ve noticed that my anxiety is better on the lower dose of kratom, though. The past few weeks, it seems like I’ve been getting a crazy high heart rate and difficulty sleeping after taking kava at night (but am also taking kratom too but in small frequent doses that are even through the day). 

I know that it is supposed to reduce anxiety and it usually does but lately it feels like it has turned on me just like kratom. Is it the kava? Does that happen? Anyone ever get anxiety or increased HR with kava?

I only slept 4 hours last night, but I used being awake for so long as an opportunity to get a bunch of school stuff done in advance. Being ahead in my classes was something I was really good about up until these past months when I started slipping behind, which I absolutely attribute to a combination of kratom and burnout from doing work and school both fulltime for several years (but mostly kratom).  


I've hardly eaten in the last few days, but I've managed to consume much more food since this morning. The lethargy seems to have let up a good deal, but is definitely still present. Random sweating bouts are still occuring. Mood is mostly stable, with some anxiety and bits of sadness sprinkled in. Libido is suddenly cranked up to like 200% from nothing, but *everything* is insanely sensitive, if you catch my drift. I'll still take that over dead libido anyday, though.  


**So, overall, I'd say that things are already greatly improved!** The worst stretch thus far was somewhere between the middle of day 2 and the beginning of day 4, when just walking downstairs in my apartment felt like it took every last bit of energy in my being, and I couldn't keep track of a damn thing (constantly forgetting where I put my keys, etc).   


I'm still taking all the same supplements at the same dosages that I described in a comment in one of my other posts--I think they've helped somewhat. Now that I've gotten more on top of my school responsibilities, I finally feel comfortable resuming a full time workout routine, as bodybuilding has been a big hobby of mine for several years. Being on kratom daily makes it basically impossible to progress for a number of reasons, so I look forward to actually progressing again, even though I know I've probably dropped 10 pounds and an embarassing amount of strength.  


I hope all of you are doing well today! The weather is still wonderful here in the deep south since things have cooled off, and I wish I could share the beauty of where I'm at with some of you--it's quite a pick-me-up.",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9712652564048767}"

I have not posted in a long time because I relapsed again after my month long taper in July.

It's so bad I don't even feel it anymore unless I take at least 2 tablespoons of the sludge.  I feel pretty confident this time though because I came clean to my doctor and my new therapist about it and my Smart Recovery group.  Can't fail now.  Too many people are rooting for me.

The other thing I did was start Wellbutrin back on August 28th.  I read somewhere on this sub that it has helped some others make the detox better so I thought I'd try it. Then I started Lamictal a few days ago.  So far this is a pretty great blend as I feel like my depression is gone and now my anxiety is much better.

The severity of these symptoms really blindsided me and allowing something to have this much of a physiological hold on me really bothers me.

My story: 6 days CT, 3 gpd for 5 months.   No sleep for the first 100 hrs due to constant RLS while at rest.  After reading on this sub how some folks found Gabapentin to be a life saver for RLS I called my GP to ask for a Gabapentin script.  This was the start of the conversation:

Me: Hi I’m coming off Kratom CT and my RLS has kept me awake for the past 5 days.
GP: Hold up, what was the substance you said you were taking?
Me: Kratom
GP: Can you spell that for me?
Me:  K R A T O M
GP: Is that some kind of marijuana thing.
Me: Ahh no....

Needles to say, she was not real helpful on how much I should take, or how often.

I held off tonight until about 9 PM and took 300 mg. Gabapentin.  About an hour and a half later I was super sleepy and my eyes were drooping heavily.  I took an Ipsom salt bath and snuggled into bed for what I hoped would be some actual healing sleep.  No dice.  Still RLS every minute or so.

My question is: should I bump up to 600 mg and would that increased dose start to mitigate the RLS?  Should I be taking the Gabapentin spread out through the day or should it be effective by dosing a couple hours before bedtime?  

My fear is that if it doesn’t seem to be working at all at 300 mg., taking 600 would just make me more doped out but still unable to sleep (if I’m gonna be up I would to prefer to be able to watch a movie and go for walks and any more doped up on Gabapentin seems like I’d be chair or bed bound).

I've had a habit for 2 years that, just like everyone here, started small and fun and like the answer to all life's problems, and ended up big and daily and no fun at all. I'm constantly nauseous, sleep deprived and have heartburn, among other things. Right now I'm up to 5 heaping teaspoons a day, so 15gpd- which isn't a lot compared to others but is just wreaking havoc on me.

Because I'm a little OCD I've kept a daily record of my doses and and the last year practically every day added notes about wanting to quit and how miserable this makes me. I did quit back in April and logged back then; the first 3 days were hard, after 2 weeks I felt so much better and after 2 months I wrote I had no idea why I ever did this stuff, it seems like a joke, I had no cravings and I remembered it was a shitty high anyway.

Then a shitstorm happened in June and I was just looking for anything that would let me feel a little better for a minute. I vowed I would only do 1/4 tsp. Three days later I was back to my regular dose and haven't stopped since. So angry at myself for having to start all over but also know after a few tough days it will all be fine.

Trying to plan ahead & fill my upcoming days with healthy activities and little rewards. The thing I hate most about this addiction is how selfish it makes me, I've been wasting all my time trying to feel good and sitting around being high, when I could be helping other people, my family, my community.

I'm in an awful place mentally. The worst I've ever been (and I'm bipolar, so I've had tons of bad mental states to compare). I'm not going to hurt myself or anyone else because I have custody of my incredible niece and I could NEVER do that to her.

So inpatient is also so important so I can be on the meds that have kept me alive for years. 

But. I'm still only in the beginning of my taper. They're obviously not going to give me krapom in the hospital to continue my taper. And I cannot do CT because the PAWS from last time I did is what ultimately made me get back on k.

NEW to thread. 40-50gpd to 16 so far!,"I was on naltrexone, clean and sober, doing great for 9 months.  One day, I did Pilates after years of inactivity and went to the chiropractor, I could no longer walk. Found out I only had one half of a disc left at L5/S1, with a 5 mm herniation and bone spurs stretching the nerve to a breaking point. It cut off sensations to my leg and I could no longer feel my foot. So it was have an emergency operation or wheelchair in a year. I got thru the surgery, got successfully on and off Norco, but was still in tremendous agony. I was getting a ton of pressure from 12-step and ex to get off the Norco quickly after surgery. I still have no disc on one side, just bone grinding on bone. Someone from a 12-step program told me about kratom. I started taking it and quickly ramped up to 40-50gpd since July. Ugh. I'm such an idiot. I had no idea how bad the W/Ds are. I successfully tapered off of 24mg suboxone 5 years ago and the W/Ds feel very similar. Panic attacks! So MUCH anxiety. No joy. Moodiness. So much Pain especially in the leg where the nerves are coming alive. Crying. My mind feels fractured. No focus. Insomnia, almost mania. Paranoia even. No fun. I got thru all that to get stuck on this kratom shit!!!

I found the thread on ULDN (ultra low dose naltrexone), made a batch, and have been experimenting with it as I start to taper. Was able to immediately cut my dose from 40 to 16 mg, with a lot less W/Ds and tolerance. But I am sweating. A lot. And freezing. I took too much ULDN a couple times and had some precipitated W/Ds. It was horrible. I dialed it back now to 100mcg of ULDN and 16 mg of kratom daily, until I drop it over the weekend. I am dying to get off this crap forever and get back on naltrexone to block those beat up receptors in my brain. Now I know my brain chemistry went bananas went I had to go off naltrexone for pain management before my surgery in June.

I am so glad to know I am not the only one with horrible side effects. Having the sick realization that you have this horrible kratom monkey on your back is terrifying and isolating. I live alone and the rumination is the worse. The worst part is that I was so active in a 12-step program and now I feel like a fraud. I just didn't know what the fuck I was doing!

I am making a full recovery from the surgery and am back at work from home so now is the time to taper. Wish me luck! I need the support because I feel like a failure. I am still sober, just celebrated a year. I know I can do this. I just have to buckle up for the ride.

I started using it 1.5 years ago after seeing its use encouraged on a stop drinking site.  I joined the kratom reddit and thought I was moving in the right direction.  It’s in the coffee family and can’t be that bad, not!  I didn’t really quit drinking but noticed when I would drink and take kratom, I had some horrible hangovers, even when I didn’t drink too much.  It was probably a sign of the kratom addiction and withdrawals setting in.  I was averaging 15-20gpd, all day, morning to night.  A few months ago, every morning I was waking up feeling like absolute shit and the only thing that made me feel better was taking more kratom.  In mid-August, I decided it was time to give this crap up.  I tapered from 15-20gpd to 5-7gpd right away and was experiencing all the withdrawal symptoms: rls, crying throughout the day, itchy legs, messed up sleep, fatigued, out of sorts, feeling crazy, etc.  I was determined to keep moving forward and kind of plateaued at this dose because I was about to start a new job.  The smaller doses I was taking did relieve the withdrawal symptoms, but it was a huge up/ down cycle.  

I give all the cold turkey quitting folks out there a huge shout out.  You are some brave people.  After about 6 weeks of tapering and getting my dose down to 3gpd for the last week I think I’m finally ready to jump.  I took one .6 gram capsule yesterday and one this morning at 5am and will only take one to relieve any really uncomfortable withdrawals.  From following this sub, I see that days 3-4 are hard so I may not be completely done yet.  I’m mentally done though.  What a hell of a bitch to go through.  I’ve noticed I’m feeling again and my high/ lows are not really present anymore.  I am so glad to be near the end.  I don’t ever want to go back.  Not a fun way of living.  Reading everyone’s post has been so helpful and supportive.  Made me feel less alone during such a hard time.  Much love to you all going through this.

I have really bad body/back pain.
I’ve had it for such a long time that it’s hard to remember going without it.
I also used to dabble in other things, and when I went through those wd’s a few years back, I was turned onto Kratom and that saved my life.

Recently my body pain has gotten so bad that I started using everyday, and I have been for around 6-7 months.

But I want to quit because I don’t want to be dependent on it, the price of buying it every 2wks & the fact that I need to get healthier.

So I tapered off over 4ish days, and it’s been about 6 days since my last dose.

The RLS is unbearable although I’m able to get small bouts of sleep at least.

Since I tapered, is there any idea how long I’ll be feeling like I want to run into the wall?
I don’t mean until I feel perfect, just until I can lay down and focus on my phone or the tv long enough for a break.

This is definitely the worst wds I’ve ever had from Kratom, but still not as bad as the worst wds I’ve experienced.
The difference is just that for the previous one, Kratom was my solution.

So any advice on supplements that could help, mostly things I could get at a Target since that’s near where I live.

I just got paid and it’s taking all of my will not to say ‘f—- it’ and take more so I can relax.
But I want to do this.
The pain is just rough.

I had a phenibut issue and have been off it for almost 3 months now. While getting off phenibut I could barely take any kratom because it was making me feel even worse. I eventually was able to take it again, but that only lasted a few weeks before it started making me feel so so bad most of the time. It started effecting my vision, made my balls hurt, almost felt like a mild stroke victim mentally, lethargic, etc. Symptoms that I don’t really read about on here a whole lot. 

It seems like the majority have trouble getting off it because it still has positive effects, for me it doesn’t even feel like an opiate anymore. It started feeling like some dysphoric, stimmy, SSRI that I was not compatible with. TBH there were a few times it almost made me feel like a mild schizophrenic, mind just all over the place. Migraines behind my eyes... jeez. 

Down to 2gpd, and after feeling AWFUL again last night I’m done taking it. Symptoms have cleared up quite well. I put myself out there and my odd symptoms because I’m curious who else felt similar, and for people to read what can happen.

So it's been about a week and half since quitting Kratom again (this was after a 2-month relapse after being clean for 6 months and was only at a 1/5 of what I used to take for a daily dose). I'm hanging by a thread, but really trying to kick this and find happiness without drugs or alcohol (I quit drinking 5 years ago, 6 months before I found kratom!). Withdrawal symptoms are minimal, feeling my back pain again but that's familiar, but it's mostly learning to cope with my depression/anxiety daily without substances that's bothering me. 

My BF and I are moving across the country to my home state next week. So naturally, since he has a lot of friends he's kept up with from high school, he's throwing a going away party tomorrow night. There will be light drinking and smoking weed.

I don't know how to get through this. I used alcohol and kratom largely because of my social anxiety issues. I've never had to be part of a party that I can't retreat from. Any parties I've ever gone to while sober from alcohol, I always gave myself an out if I got too triggered.

I've told my bf that I am going to feel uncomfortable but will get through it somehow. So he knows this is trigger city for me. Honestly, getting off of Kratom is triggering me to want to drink socially again. I was a binge drinker, not a daily drinker, but like Kratom, it was really fucking with my depression issues. 

I keep thinking that I've somehow beat my issues with alcohol, I slipped once earlier in the year at a 4th of july party with my family (that were driving me crazy, it was a self-preservation moment), and honestly didn't think twice about it after. It was a way to get through the night and nothing more. I was upfront with my bf and therapist about this slip, and neither were worried with how I drank or reacted to the whole thing. They were much more concerned with my Kratom slip because that was a full on relapse for 2 months. 

I know drugs/alcohol aren't the answer. But in a risk mitigation/harm reduction type of philosophy, is it crazy of me to consider just taking a night off from alcohol sobriety,? The way I see it is at least I'm not relapsing with Kratom, which would be a whole lot worse. I'm probably in addict brain mode though, trying to make deals with myself because life is just full of obstacles that I don't think I can handle. I've talked to my bf about kinda wanting to lightly drink again since I feel I'm in a completely different place than I was 5 years ago, and he insists I talk to a therapist about it first. Lucky me, I actually have an appointment tomorrow morning with my therapist, so now that I'm writing this, I realize I should definitely bring it up in our session.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9942307472229004}"

I've been lucky to have slept this entire time, although it's been in broken increments of a few hours at a time. Still, that's definitely better than the usual ""awake for days on end"" struggle with that unbearable RLS (probably my least favorite withdrawal symptom).  


I've somehow survived 2 exams, a number of assignments, and a couple lab + lab reports this week despite being in withdrawal. It's taken an enormous amount of caffeine and will power just to walk across my apartment to sit at my computer and get my work done, and even more to go to my job.   


  
The lethargy is still pretty severe, I'm sweating all the time, and I have little bouts where my mood just absolutely tanks. Despite that, I'm loving being hyper-emotional. Having my favorite songs give me the chills and sometimes bring me tears is an incredible feeling, as is experiencing a lot of emotion I've been surpressing the last 6+ months, positive and negative. It's cathartic, to say the least.  


This is so close to being over! The lethargy should be easing up very soon, and I'm already feeling a lot less dumb (for lack of a better word). I think the supplements I've been taking have probably been helping a great deal. Can't wait to be fully me again!

For those of you who are in deeper and in a more impossible situation:      get capsules and take as many capsules as you need to feel ok, then remove a capsule or 2 daily until you're out.

Also, here is secret weapon:  kava kava tea really does work. Tastes awful.. but so does kratom lol.
Find a reputable kava business (like bula kava house, the one i used).. get yourself a strainer bag to prep the kava, and enjoy!
