2021-10-30 17:09:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qjaobr/10_day_ct_update_from_a_lot_per_day/,10 day CT update from... A lot? Per day.,"Today is day 10, I quit on my birthday on 10/20. I feel the worst of the physical symptoms has gone by. Honestly didn't much mind the malaise or cold feeling. It made classes pretty rough, but the worst was the weird, almost acute anxiety sensation that rose as it got later in the night.

This chest sensation, I'm not sure if it is heart palpitations, anxiety, or a symptom of the RLS, made it near impossible to comfortably lay down, let alone sleep. I had to get up and move around a lot to keep it at bay, which led to very exhausted muscles. The first 1-3 days I sometimes went on a walk as late as midnight, even with classes at 8 am the next day, because I knew that chest sensation + RLS would keep me up anyway.

And it was absolutely the worst symptom by far. It's actually one of the worse feelings I've felt in my short life. It's pretty much the sole reason I wanted to take.more Kratom, but I recognized two things: 

1: If I took kratom, which I knew was not a sustainable practice, I would end up going through this again, which was not an option

2: If I took kratom, all the terrible nights I had would have been for absolutely nothing.

So i pretty much just stubbornly powered through it. I think the worst days were 1-3 for me, 4-5 it was still not great, and 6-10 have been not so bad. The last 2 nights I've slept pretty well, considering, and the chest sensation/RLS have minimized to where I can actually get to sleep. I still have problems staying asleep, for some reason it feels like I am sick with a cold or something? Not literally but just for the sleep aspect, when I have a cold I have restless sleep and weird dreams, so it's still like that. But basically my physical withdrawals are very minimal relatively speaking, by now. The worst one, the chest sensation at night, is still detectable but barely. So I'm pretty much in the clear as far as that goes.

As far as mentally, I think I'm depressed regardless of withdrawals, have been for a while. But sometimes I get little fleeting feelings of optimism or something? I decided I wanted to commit to one of my dreams of making a game on a whim, and started looking up music, art, game design stuff since I'm in a programming degree course. Dunno where that came from. I haven't had much motivation or energy from lack of sleep to commit fully to starting that process, but the fact that I decided at all that I wanted to commit to such a huge project over the next many years is a good sign. Maybe the kratom had some effect on the depression and that's subsiding, who knows.

Though these fleeting feelings do remind me of the buzz I'd get from marijuana, nicotine, and kratom. Makes me miss that I could get a little jolt of ""happiness"" on demand, and makes me want to get more. But I'll figure out a way to get it back without self medicating.


That's pretty much all I got, spammed a huge wall but I wanted to update when the physical symptoms went away for me, because those were the worst and I did use other people's posts here as motivation to keep going. So maybe thisll help someone idk.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.71735805}"
2021-10-30 13:40:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qj6gz9/101_days_my_storythoughts/,101 days - My story/thoughts,"Hello, hope everyone is doing well.  I decided to quit 101 days ago, July 21st.  Substance abuse has been an issue for me for years.  When I discovered kratom it seemed like a miracle.  Something that was legal and easily accessible that gave me energy and enhanced my mood.  It was a ""clean"" way to self medicate. 

I remember  when I started waking up in the middle of the night feeling horrible and realized I needed to take more to get back to sleep.  I remember when I started hiding it from my significant other.  I remember when I started lying about my use.  I remember when I no longer really enjoyed taking it, I needed it to function.

I was finally given a deadline.  I had an international trip coming up and couldn't bring it with me.  We bought the tickets late one night and I decided to quit the next day.  I took a small dose in the morning, went to work and decided I would wait as long as possible.  Then I figured i would just never take it again.  I decided then and there I was going to make some serious changes in my life.

One thing I did early on was come clean to my spouse.  I told her the truth and that I was gonna be struggling for a few weeks.  She wasn't happy but she understood and at least I didn't have to make excuses for why I was sick.  I powered through work, faking it all day and collapsing at home.  I have heard people say the first 3-5 days are the worst, and that's sort of true but I really struggled with physical withdrawals for 2-3 weeks until I felt somewhat normal.  I took this as an opportunity to not only rid myself of an addiction, but become a healthier person overall.  

From day 1 I ate healthy.  Low sugar, low carbs, veggies and chicken, home cooked meals.  I didn't drink alcohol for the first week and barely drank any for a month.  Every day, I forced myself, multiple times to do some cardio and strength training.  Sometimes sheer anger and frustration fueled my workouts, whatever it took.  Some workouts were 5 minutes of angry pushups and sit ups, Calf raises, dumbell exercises.  Some were a full 30 minute thrashing on an exercise bike..  One thing I noticed is that once my blood got pumping, I would briefly experience a reduction in withdrawal symptoms.  I also slept a little better. If there is one thing I could suggest to people going through this, exercise as much as possible.  I don't care if it's 1 minute, do something and don't sell yourself short.  Don't just wallow at home either, get outside and do something to keep yourself busy.

Lack of sleep was brutal.  I think going to work actually helped keep my mind busy.  RLS was unbearable sometimes.  I took my share of Epsom baths in the middle of the night just to cope.  I was fortunate enough to have access to a few Xanax, which I took out of desperation to get at least a few hours sleep.  I only took it a few times and stopped after that.  Sweating, tossing, turning every night.  But every morning I knew I was one day closer to a better me.

The one constant that I had was the absolute fact that I would never take that shit again.  There was no question. Once I hit a month clean I started to feel somewhat normal.  My skin cleared up a bit, I felt more present and less moody.  I remember working out on kratom and getting lightheaded and nauseated. Now, I felt great after pushing myself to the limit.

By the time we left for my trip, I was over 50 days clean and was able to enjoy myself and didn't think about it once.  I realized I was free.  No more counting doses, making sure I had enough to last through the day or week.  No more cat and mouse trying to hide it.  There was a tension there that I didn't recognize until it was gone.  When I walked out the door it was watch, keys, wallet, phone...am I forgetting something? Nope!

It's not all rainbows though.  Once you get clean you have to figure out how to function with the same issues that had you using in the first place.  I wasn't happy, why was I self medicating?  For me specifically I could talk about ADHD and dopamine levels, which definitely played a role, but it was something deeper.  I was unsatisfied with where I was in life.  I expected more out of myself and wasn't achieving what I wanted to.  I wasn't passionate about anything, I wasn't focused.

A few weeks ago I decided to make another big change.  I wanted balance in my life.  To be balanced I would need discipline.  To have discipline I would need to stick to a routine.  I decided I would stick to a morning routine.  Get up early, write in a journal for a bit, work out, eat a healthy breakfast, go to work.  For many of us, this is a fantasy that happens in a movie montage.  For years, I felt the same.  But I sat down and wrote out WHY I wanted to do this.  It boiled down to a few things.

I want to feel better physically, sleep better, be stronger.  I want more out of life.  I want to save myself from the regret years later that I didn't try.  My current way of life was treading water, not swimming forward.  I wanted a challenge.

Now, I get up 5 days a week at 5:45, stretch, journal, workout, eat healthy, go to work.  I feel amazing.  My day starts with accomplishment and time to think.  The journal is basically self therapy.  I write whatever I want.  It's a flow of consciousness that helps round out what the he'll it is I want to do in life.

So it's day 101 and I still don't have everything figured out.  I still have bad days, but I know that I am at least moving forward.  Whatever stage of life you are in that has you reading this, know that you are already doing something positive.   You are reaching out for answers or help because you know you want better.  Small steps in the right direction will lead you where you want to go.  Knowing what the right direction is requires that you have a WHY.

I beg of you, take the time and try this : 
Sit down with no distractions and write down what you want in life.  Be as specific or vague as you want, but keep writing.  You will want to stop but keep going.  You will eventually write something that cuts to the core.  

Now make a list of things that serve that purpose and a list of things that don't serve that purpose.  This will make decisions about what to do next much more simple.  What do I want, and what things move me toward what I want? You can continue to refine that as you go.  Chances are, drugs like kratom are on the ""not serving my purpose"" list.

Set goals.  Short term and long term.  For many of you not taking kratom is a goal for  both, but you have to have a purpose beyond just quitting.  If you can, I would suggest some sort of routine that has you exercising and writing down your thoughts.  We all get surges of motivation here and there, but without a routine most of us fall off. I don't really know how to finish this so I'll just say I hope this was helpful to you.  Thanks for reading.",38,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46687037}"

2021-10-29 12:14:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qigct3/round_2/,Round 2,"Hi all. I’ve been Kratom user off and on now for 3-4 years. My latest round of addiction began when the COVID work-from-home environment started. I’ve been taking \~30gpd since March 2020. Never missing a day and always staying on schedule. I had been through detox once before after using similar amounts for close to a year (which I’ll refer to below as Round 1) but I wasn’t as a consistent day-to-day user as I was more recently (Round 2).

My experiences with quitting Kratom during Round 1 caught me completely by surprise. I had experienced the ups and downs of the drug by not using it every day but never experienced more than just some fogginess, maybe a headache here and there, and hot flashes. But man, when I decided to eliminate Kratom from daily use, I experienced about 3-4 days of cold/flu symptoms, intense restless-body, anxiety, depression, which was then followed by 2 week period of brain fog. 

I should also note, that I’ve been taking drugs recreationally since I was a teenager (I’m 40yo now). I have experience with most mainstream drugs and the only other one that I ever struggled with was speed (amphetamines and cocaine). I’ve been through detox before but I think what really threw me off with Kratom was (a) the intense restless-body and (b) the sheer length of time before I felt like myself.

Fast forward to Round 2 and my recent 19 months of habitual use. I now have a 2yo toddler, a wife pregnant with baby #2, a new house that’s stretching our budget, a promotion and important role within my company and all the other shit life throws at you. I was scared. 

So I came to reddit to refresh my memory on the experience. I was asking myself questions like “Am I remembering this right?” And “Do others have the same experience?” What I read from this reddit community did two things (1) made me scared as shit and (2) made me realize that I really needed to do as much prep as I could. I made sure I planned around my work and home calendar (to the best one could), I loaded up on melatonin, vitamins, anti-inflammatory, magnesium, and electrolytes. I set the date, warned my boss that I was changing medications that could have some adverse effects. The official date of last ingestion was Tuesday, 10/26, at 3pm. I wanted to start earlier but had received a couple last minute fires to put out and needed the extra push to clear that crap off my plate. 

What followed was what we all discuss but with some key differences. From 10/26 3pm to 10/27 9pm, I was fine. A little groggy, cloudy etc. I even worked from \~8:30am to 7pm. But when I tried to go to sleep that night, holy shit, I was hit by a truck. It’s 10/11pm on 10/27 (approx 31hrs since last dose) I had taken my electrolytes and magnesium supplement, smoked some pot, took a normal dose of melatonin, and prepared to lay down in bed while listening to guided mediation for sleep. 

Almost immediately, my body felt like it needed to run a marathon. It felt like energy was pushing its way out from every inch of my body - not in a good way. The sensation of restless body is something that is hard to comprehend if you’ve never experienced it before. It’s combining physiological anxiety that one would normally experience in their chest and mind, but rather throughout the entire body. So hard to describe but its unsettling to say the least. I never really fell asleep that night - woke up with stomach cramps (requiring multiple trips to the bathroom), chills, sweats, and the worst part of all, woke up multiple times to bile in my mouth and the aftermath of burning throughout my mouth and throat. I think I finally got through those physical symptoms at around 5am and slept until 8am (had to get up for a 9am meeting).

I spent the rest of my day on 10/29 tired and highly stressed by the smallest things at work. But at the same time I felt proud that I had forced myself to handle my responsibilities and attend all my meetings. I stopped work around 4:45pm, asked my wife to pick up some fast food (oddly, this detox was giving me serious cravings for junk food). I spent the rest of my evening laying on sofa, doing my best to interact with my son while waiting for him to go to bed so I could do the same. 

Around 9pm, I started the same process, rolled/smoked a joint, took some melatonin, vitamins etc and laid in bed while watching TV. I felt a much more milder form of restless body but this time it didnt stop be from decompressing. I was tired and had no problem falling asleep. I slept through the night well, only briefly waking up a couple times to change positions in bed but falling right back to sleep. I finally woke up around 8am, checked my email and calendar to make sure I didnt have to jump up for a meeting, and took my time getting ready. I was groggy again but from what? The detox? The joint I smoked and melatonin? It wasn’t obvious to me and that was a good thing. 

I prepped myself for my first 10am meeting and surprisingly felt good. So here I am, 11:30am on day 3 - 68hours into my CT Kratom detox and I feel good. Is there still more to come? I don’t see how that is possible but I’ve got to be prepared in case it does.

I’m scratching my head here and trying to think of what the differences were between this and the last time I detoxed. I would have thought that this experience would have been exactly the same or worse based the info I mentioned early on. The only other 3 key differences are (1) this time I take 10mg of lexapro which could be controlling the depression and anxiety (2) I prepared myself for the detox with supplements and (3) I’m older with responsibilities that prevent me from closing a door and hiding away. Is #3 legitimate? I feel like I’m slighting other people who have worse experiences by implying that “oh I’m more mature and have learned to handle feeling like shit - having a kid does that to you”. 

Or is it really all about #1 and 2? 

I don’t know but I’ll be sure to update my story if I take another turn for the worse. I keep hearing about the dreaded day 4 of Kratom detox and how this could haunt me for weeks and maybe months. God, I hope not - I just want to feel like myself again. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this if you made it this far. Felt like I had to contribute my story since I relied on so many of yours to help prepare myself for this fight. And I hope I don’t go back. While it felt like a performance enhancing drug for a 3-6 months, it really just turned into a chore and maintenance schedule.

Be well all - and if you’e going through detox or thinking about it - you got this. Take you life back - it’ll be worth it.",11,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6115492}"

Im tapering now and I don’t know how much I shall be taking prior of an “CT”. GPD is that gram per day or? I have never weighed it, but used 9-10 spoons(normal spoons for food, not smaller tablespoons for coffee etc) in daily litre bottles so drinking it spread out during my awake hours. 

If GPD is grams I guess I took a lot GPD then? I’m down to 3-6 spoons per day. 

So I have booked and payed for a trip to Thailand for 2w this Xmas with my family - so I’m using this now as an extra “forced motivation” to quit. (Probably I will never leave Thailand again if I get caught).

I had the flu feeling with restlessness. I took 3 showers a day for the 3 days. I would get my bathroom super steamy and I would just try to sweat out as much as I could.  I couldn't sleep at all so I spent the wee hours reading posts on here from all of you.  I didn't try any sleep aids or anything so I just dealt with the restlessness. Day 4 I finally got a couple hours sleep, and I actually woke up feeling good. Honestly the best I've felt in years. Since then I've felt better a little bit every day. I feel sharper mentally. I feel like my old self is back. I still have a couple issues....My stomach is in bad shape, everything I eat and drink goes right through me.  I've also started dealing with premature ejaculation. I've never had this issue before in my life. I definitely feel like my libido is back 100% but I can't last more than a few seconds.  Maybe my penis has feeling and sensation in it again?

I started ingesting K on the day Prince died.  I live about 45 mins from Minneapolis and decided to go look at the bridge lit up in Purple for him. Well, since I was there I decided to hit up a local head shop in the university areas of U of M.  That's where I first found Kratom. I wasnt a much of a weed smoker and was totally open to trying something legal, so I bought my first bag of capsules that night. I took some on the way home and was super sleepy by the time I got home that i got into bed immediately.

I have finally decided to get off it and I have tried before and always failed. Usually i cant go one day without it. BUT HERE I AM... Kratom free and it's been almost 2 weeks and I havent caved and bought more. My advice for others... let yourself run out. The anxiety of "" running out"" is WORSE than running out. Just try it.

I found an unassuming container at a glorified gas station that I had read about briefly and thought I'd give it a try.

From the moment I took my first dose of red Bali, I knew I was onto something. It was the warm sensation that I was familiar with from other opioids. So warm in fact that I never felt the prick of the snake that had just bit me. 

For years the snake slithered around in my mind slowly injecting more poison into my body until it's venom was coursing through my veins. My wife told me there was something controlling me but I could never see it.

Then finally, one day I caught a glimpse of it in the shadows of my mind, and it's beady little eyes stared back at me mockingly. Years of free reign had emboldened this wretched creature, and it realized just how much control it held over me. 

Now that I saw it, I knew I had to kill it. I spent months tapering down only to find myself back where I started. The snake was laughing at me now because it thought there was nothing I could to to exercise it. Pissed off, I grabbed my machete and attacked it.

The battle lasted a full week. For the first 3 1/2 days it was beating me. My body shook uncontrollably, and every 60 minutes or so I was overwhelmed by a feeling of intense sadness, enough to bring me to my knees, screaming and crying like a baby. These episodes lasted about 20 minutes, afterwards I lie on my weapon briefly, but each time summoning the courage to pick it back up and get back in the fight.

After the dust had settled I realized how much I had given over the years to this monster. I looked at my family again, this time as if it were the first time. My conversations became important again, my priorities began falling into place. My energy had returned. Even the filtered sunlight peaking through the trees seemed brighter somehow.

If you are part of this group then you have caught a glimpse of this snake. Do yourself a favor and cut the head off the son of a bitch already and EARN your freedom back. You can't live or love fully on k, it extracts too big of a toll. The longer you wait the harder it will be.

I joked with a member that I wish I could mount the head of the son of a bitch on my wall. They suggested that a post might serve as my mount, as well as help someone else. So here is my metaphorical severed head. It's not as dramatic as a mount on a wall but more practical I suppose. 

I originally posted this 3 years ago, and I am happy to say I am still free. For the most part it's just a terrible memory now and I have moved on. Every once and a while I think I see the eyes in the darkness of my mind and the warm sensation pours back over me, beckoning  me back in. But I always remember what it took from me.

I've recently been taking another dose during that time just to fall back asleep, but I wonder if this is normal.

Even on 5gpd CT seems like it would be hell, let alone 50 gpd.
It sounds like an awfully torturous process when one could be gently tapering.

The only thing I can think of is that the whole process of tapering is too drawn out. However, CT is so violent to the system than I am worried i might not survive (mentally).
So, if anyone has any insights on this that will be appreciated.

I tried to quit multiple times cold turkey throughout those years but it never stuck for longer than 3 weeks. I decided to taper down over a month this time and took my last dose of kratom on July 29th. I had fairly minor acute withdrawals for 5 to 7 days probably. Soon after I went into PAWS and that's where I've been ever since. It's been hell at times. There have been weeks where I just wanted to die I felt so drained and depressed. I did nothing but grit my teeth through work all day wanting to go home so badly, only to get there and be miserable. Just lying around waiting for any sign of improvement. There have been good days and bad days. It's very unpredictable in my experience. I'm feeling much better now though. I wouldn't say I'm quite 100% back to normal, but I'm close. Maybe 90%.

And it has absolutely been worth all of the pain and patience required to get to this point. I feel more in control of my life. I'm actually getting into playing bass guitar again. I feel more like me. Life's still not perfect, but I'm learning to adapt and move forward without kratom as my warm blanket to get me through tough times. And that is truly liberating and empowering. I still think about it here and there and have the occasional craving, but I think I'm finally done. My life is better without kratom. It's time to move forward.

I didn't follow a lot of the advice of eating healthy, working out, meditation etc. In fact, I started smoking weed AND cigarettes again to get by because I felt I had to use something to cope and it couldn't be kratom. Never again. I quit the cigarettes after a few weeks and am still smoking weed daily. Gotta work on quitting weed next, but that time will come soon enough and I've done it before. That's nothing compared to quitting kratom in my book. I'm sorry for the rambling nature of this post and I don't exactly know where I'm going with this, but I just wanted to share my experience and offer a few words of encouragement. 

Quitting kratom isn't easy. It's fucking hard. But it IS possible. Remember why you are quitting. Do whatever you have to in order to stay off of it. Know that going back is a terrible idea and it will never be worth it in the end. Be kind to yourself. Don't be afraid to take it easy and focus on yourself. Take it one day at a time. Be patient. Know that you will have many ups and downs in the process of quitting. It may be months before you truly start to feel the benefits of quitting. And if you mess up and relapse? That's ok. It's part of the processs. As long as you keep trying. That's the key. Because eventually, if you really want to quit, with enough effort, you will make it happen. If I can do it, so can you.

I haven’t touched opiates in years and have been sober from alcohol for about 7 months now. Right around the time I got sober, I was introduced to kratom in its liquid extract form. I liked the way in made me feel, gave me energy and a comforting euphoria. Just like any addiction, months go by and I just kept increasing my daily dose. It’s gotten really bad. Ive spent an embarrassing amount of money on this stuff. 

I’ve been trying to quit for a while now but I always just act on impulse and lie to myself about doing it, “just one more time.” My boyfriend is in the same boat as me and it’s just been so hard. We love each other deeply but this has caused such a strain on us, emotionally, financially, and with our intimacy. 

I’ve kicked dope, booze, Suboxone many times, and eventually was successful. It’s just so hard, I’m surrounded by gas stations and stores that sell it. I can’t do it anymore. I work really hard for my money and it makes me so depressed that I’ve just been squandering it on as something as stupid as kratom. 

A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed bipolar and have been taking medication for that. It truly has made a difference and feel like I have made a lot of progress in regards to my depression and mood instability. I was hoping it would help with my impulse control but I know I need to put the work in.

However, I now need to stop altogether with this nonsense because of daily panic attacks etc if I don’t take the Kratom.

I just feel that if focusing on the, a little better each day versus the, what have I done, seems to help me. Make it about not what you've done or even how you feel any given day, but about what your doing and how at least this large obstacle is out of your life and you WILL heal. Try to put kratom out of mind, your cleansing your body of this poison, so cleanse your mind of it also, it is all connected, accept the fact that it's out of your life in body AND mind and I believe such emphasis is taken away from the obsessive thoughts of ""how we feel"" at every moment due to kratom ever being the part of our lives that it was, much less the fears of quitting and effects from it, sometimes long-lasting. Simply trying to say to not associate every damn feeling you have in regards to kratom. Sometimes it is actually just life. Sometimes we don't feel good, sometimes we can be anxious, so on and so on. It's just life. Sorry for the ramble, hope it makes sense.

I decided to use Kratom once a week (Monday’s) after being 1 month clean from a 10 month 20gpd habit. I loved feeling energized and happy the first day of a work week. Eventually, over the span of a month I slowly moved into everyday usage. 5g every morning. The last 1.5 months I’ve been up to 10gpd with a few extract shots thrown in on weekends. 

Now to my stupid plan. I got married 1.5 weeks ago on the west coast, and I didn’t plan any taper before leaving to the west with no Kratom. I was only gone for 3 days, but holy shit the plane trip back on the last day was unbearable. Two 3 hour flights with a 2 hour layover in Minneapolis. Allllll night I was feeling so restless, I couldn’t get comfortable I couldn’t sleep. Classic WD response that I remember. When I got back home I immediately dosed and slept 16 hours until the next day. 

Now I am traveling for a week in a foreign country starting this Sunday. After the last trip I wanted to prepare a little bit. I haven’t had any Kratom since last Friday, so I’m on day 4. Been a struggle for sure, but by the time I leave for vacation I should be past the physical parts. I’ll be extremely busy seeing everything on vacation, which has always worked as a distraction for me in past quit attempts. (My quit before this relapse I drove 2 states down to visit friends and get drunk over a long weekend and stayed quit for a month when I got back.)

So now ill be 9 days clean and ready to travel. A 4 month relapse, even at a lower amount, still kicked my ass while CT. I learned I really can’t do intermittent consumption of Kratom. I always end up back at square one…

It's crazy to look back at my posts just a month ago I was posting screaming for help thinking I would never get off it, it felt SO HOPELESS because I had so much going on, I've been applying to graduate schools, taking classes, training for a marathon, I'm in a relationship, my mother just passed away, and all of it felt insurmountable without Kratom but truth be told, while the first week or two sucked, I was still far more productive than I was when I was on it, and the withdrawals, while uncomfortable, were far less than I expected they were going to be, and I was coming off of 5 extract shots a day. Paws hit me very hard the second week with anhedonia and depression and fatigue, I felt like a wet blanket and I almost went out and picked up a shot a couple times but I am so glad I didn't, I feel like I'm finally finding myself again. I've been taking Kratom for around 5 years, and have quit multiple times but I always succumb to paws or end up thinking I can just use it once to relax, but I am done, it's not worth it, there is no discernable benefit from it, and there are so many costs whether financial social or emotional. Anyway, thanks for reading, I hope my story inspires someone, as this forum has been invaluable for me in my journey getting off it. Please, if you're trying to quit, have hope and compassion for yourself, if you slip, you'll be fine, on Kratom life felt so short and painful, now that I'm on the other side I can feel that life is long and that there is plenty of time to heal and grow and give back, so keep pushing because you're worth it, we're all worth it.",52,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.54046345}"

I never would have quit had it not been for that, although I always thought I would just  eventually stop once my chronic pain condition/fibro was better.  I’ve been off of it now for 7-8 weeks. My question is does anyone feel like Kratom changed their body makeup at a cellular level?  I had Lyme and mold illnesses prior to starting Kratom so I was dealing with a lot of pain and didn’t want to take pain meds anymore. Kratom helped with pain so much and also with the anxiety. Now that I’m off K my pain isn’t as bad as it actually was before Kratom. I’ve done a lot of detoxing and other things to help my body heal. But now I feel like I have an increase in anxiety whenever I have to do something like interact with people. Or anything that is emotional or requires extra energy. 

It’s hard to explain. I didn’t have this before Kratom. Like today I was on a business call and I felt totally anxious and had a weird buzzing in my arms. I know I also felt this while I was on Kratom but when I would feel it I’d take more Kratom to get through it. I don’t know if I can even explain it much more than I feel like my body has been damaged from Kratom when I’m dealing with any stress or emotions I get extra reved up or something. I can see it’s getting a little better each day. I mediate and breathe deeply when it happens but it’s just disturbing that my body is like this now.  

Has anyone else had this crazy symptom or group of symptoms and has it gotten better after being off of it?  For reference I was on around 15 grams a day or so.

But I wanted to hear if anyone else has experience with this...

I noticed a sudden, very intense fatigue when waking up one day (some months ago). It got worse and better and worse and better, but never went away since then.

I quit CT almost 3 weeks ago and it hasn't changed either.

Just a little bit later (after the fatigue first came along), I suddenly got heart palpations as well. They range from very strong to almost zero, depending on the day (and sometimes hour). My heart (I guess - at least in that area) also hurts slightly since then, even if I don't have the palpations.

I already went to hospital with this once, but all they did was a single blood test and a short ECG, apparently revealing nothing of immediate danger and no sign of a heart attack or so.

Still... it's quite worrying. If I knew it was the WD, it wouldn't be too bad, but I'm scared that my last weeks of Kratom consumption have fucked up my heart and maybe my adrenaline glands big time.

So, if anyone here has experienced something similiar, I'd be glad to hear it.

I keep going back to kratom because deep down I like it. I know it’s terrible for me and I am so sick of these tapering/withdrawal cycles. I basically either use 3-4 strong extracts a day or ~50gdp. Last Friday I had enough and bought a bunch of lower quality green indo caps. Taking 3 doses of 6gs, for a total of 18 gdp. It was honestly a too big of a drop and I’ve not been doing so great. But I committed to this and I’m not going back, even though my brain is screaming at me to go buy some OPMS shots. I also restarted counseling to address what keeps bringing me back to kratom. I have a 20 year history of drug and alcohol abuse, which really stems from childhood trauma. I quit alcohol almost 3 years ago and before that I quit stimulants and opiates about 10 years ago. I’m still using medical marijuana and will probably kick that once I have a few months off kratom. Posting here for my own accountability. I’m not giving in to this urge to buy extract. I’ve suffered through 4 days of tolerable, but still at times shitty withdrawals and I’m finally starting to stabilize at 18gdp.

God did I not want to go but once I started moving my body, I just felt this sensation of nothing and when I say nothing meaning I wasn’t in pain or aching but wasn’t high either. Just myself.

I also have been doing cold showers every day at least once a day since Saturday and I cannot stress enough it’s a game changer. Yes hot showers are awesome but I suggest at night closer to bed and cold in the morning because I sweat the mornings have been the worst since I still can’t sleep good even with the help of Xanax a couple nights and the other nights. For example I was on and off sleeping from 10pm to like 2am and then went out on the couch so I wouldn’t bother my wife with all my tossing and turning knowing I want going back to bed until maybe way later. So I went out and stretched and ate a late night meal and then just listened to a podcast. In the morning I felt like dog shit. Mind you this example has been every morning since I jumped. But I knew cold showers were helping like crazy so I decided to do one and I stayed in for a while just breathing super heavy and once I was out that was it. I felt incredible. Yes it’ll wear off but not for hours especially then you eat a healthy breakfast, take them supplements and do some morning push ups to get the blood flowing. 

The Gabapentin has helped a lot with my number on withdrawal symptom RLS but all over the body. 

The weird part for me has been when I’m sore. That’s when I crave Kratom really bad.

So I need to find other natural non-addictive ways of combatting extreme soreness. The type where you just got choked out and submitted for two hours lol.

It’s been a long journey and to finally get off something I thought would be my crutch for the rest of my life feels amazing and unreal. I plan and will fight to for sure never use an opiate of any kind ever again cuz that’s always been my vice.

So if anyone could chime in, that would be cool. The fact that's its only one trip should make things easier, I just have to struggle through these few days. I'll be calling my (sober) brothers and friends all the time, etc, trying to stay on the up and up

I think quitting has to do a lot with how badly you want to quit. It does get better! Trust the process. Every day is a battle but it’s worth the fight! What helped me the most was exercise. I replaced K with exercise. The goal is to replace your addiction with something positive. We all have addictive personalities. Why not use it for something good. I’m kind of glad that I got addicted to K, if it wasn’t for this addiction I would of never noticed how dull and numb my life was. I would have never started exercising and bettering myself.

What has helped me was my therapist recommended removing all ability to buy kratom. I gave my wife my cards and cash and it has really helped me make that decision easier. Accountable. I tapered down with her help also and it really took away a lot of the physical withdrawals. It was by no means easy but I was able to sleep enough each night without making myself miserable.

After being in rehab for a couple months I don't know why I gave up my sobriety for Kratom and THC. I believe it's because of why I used drugs in the first place. To numb my pain. After using kratom again for a month I was in a way worse place than I was when I was staying true to my sobriety.

A huge lesson that I had to learn through multiple relapses was that in the end using is only going to make things worse. I am 30 days Kratom free, and 26 days clean and sober. (Relapsed on THC also). I'm very lucky that going back to kratom didn't lead me back to everything that I was doing. I never want to go through what i went through detoxing while institutionalized ever again.

•Black Seed Oil(primarily when to take, how often).                
•Vitamin C (heard it is good to overload system with this)
•Kava Candy (Planning to take when feeling a rush of anxiety)
•Ashwaghanda (not sure about when or how much to take of this one).
•Passionflower extract ( also planning to take when feeling a rush of anxiety)
•Cannabis(for sleep)
•Valerian Root extract(also for sleep)

I have been taking Kratom since December, so almost a year now and before that I would take it for months at a time with only like a week break in between. I’ve been through Kratom withdrawals before but I always end up giving up. I think the longest I’ve ever got from any drug was 50 days if even that much (and that was from heroin and/or pain pills. I’ve got everything to live for, I’ve been dating a man that is way too good to me for all that he’s had to deal with, my friends and family are healthy, I have a roof over my head, a job, a car and all the things. What I don’t have is happiness. I hate myself. Kratom made me hate myself. Anyways I don’t want to get into this long thing but the main point of this post was that my last dose was yesterday, Saturday, at 4 PM. So right now I have made it 28 hours. Last week I gave up right as I got to the end of day four because that’s when things start to get bad for me.

For example - I went from 10g a dose 5-6x per day to 9.9g each dose the next day, next day 9.8g per dose and now I'm at 7.2g per dose today. 
I'm having severe pain and inflammation in my hands and wrists as well as hip pain. I was very active up to 4 wks ago when a hamstring injury took me out of my daily yoga practice and my biweekly aerial acrobatics. I've had some wrist pain on and off the last few months, more from incorrect yoga form and the strain from pulling body weight up on aerial silks. 
I'm now avoiding typical vinyasa flow yoga and weight on wrists and have not been doing aerial. I have been doing physical therapy for wrists and hamstring. I am also getting elliptical aerobics in 4x week and tai chi/qi gong or wrist free yoga on the other days. I'm also avoiding too much phone and computer use to give hands and wrists a reprieve. 
Could the kratom taper be causing pain and inflammation?? Is it possible that my regular sweaty yoga practice was helping me detox and reduce inflammation during my taper and now that I don't have that the pain is showing up?
I'm miserable and desperately miss my vinyasa flow yoga practice and doing aerial. I plan to find a yoga therapist who can help me with form and adaptations. 
This method of taper has worked great and made me feel really accomplished to see my progress. But if it could be the reason for the pain and inflammation I may slow down. 
Note on diet, I am recovering from an eating disorder that is entangled with many aspects of my life. This ED and ADHD causes me to eat the same meal every day.

Planning on finding a new nutritionist that might be able to help me and possibly going back to eating disorder therapist. (Switched from ED therapist to DBT program)

anyway, I'm on day 2 (following a two day relapse that came after 4 days clean) of quitting the four letter extract shots and was at 1 to 2 shots a day for a long time. The passed 6 months or so has been pretty consistent - at least 1 shot a day - but there would be 2 shots in there from time to time, followed by a day or two of none at all due to $$$ constraints. In all, I've been doing the shots consistently, almost daily, since 2019 (save for that 6 month quit and other short lived quit attempts during covid). This brings me to my next issue.

I've been job hunting just to feel somewhat productive and normal and **I woke up this morning to a phone call from one of the companies I applied to and the thought dawned on me: if I get this job, I'm truly not sure if I am capable of performing the necessary tasks if I were to be offered a position.**

**I've quit the four letter shots before**, pre-covid. This was for 6 months, and was taking 3 at a time before that quit. The other side of this thing is beautiful - I was feeling completely normal at that point. However, I also know how fucking long it took to get me there, how fucking long the withdrawals personally affected me, and how fucking difficult it was to stay away from this shit.

So, I'm not gonna lie - I'm kind of freaking out. There's another thread on this subreddit up right now about someone asking whether or not two weeks is enough time for them to quit CT to start a new job, and I suppose my question/thread is similar, but the difference is...I know for a ***fact*** i'm still going to be feeling awful in two weeks. No way in fucking hell will I be able to deal with a job, **let alone a NEW JOB** while feeling anxious, jumpy, depressed, and scared of everything. Shit, quitting kratom the last time basically made my last job crash and burn.

I'm in a really bad predicament guys and need some advice. This next part is also very important as to how I am feeling and my current state, and imo plays the largest role in quesitoning how I should balance my K quit and job search:

I currently take ADHD meds and have since I was about 25. Not a huge dose, but I've found that despite heightening *some* aspects of K withdrawals, it actually puts me in a way better mental state and oddly enough helps me quit way better. However, the dosage I am at makes it extremely difficult to have it filled on time being as my small town and local pharmacy do not get it on a regular basis. In other words, I am going to be out of that medication in two weeks and without it until mid November.

**This will leave me at a new job - which I always have anxiety about as a sober person anyway - only like 2 weeks into quitting a hefty K habit and without my ADHD meds which will make absolute sure that I am drowsy, undermotivated and just.....blah**

I understand I'm in a predicament of my own design right now. Right now, balancing this job shit and quitting K is my utmost priority. I will be quitting the ADHD meds as soon as K is a distant memory in my mind. After that, it will be nicotine and vaping. Right now, my only focus is quitting this fucking K. However, **it's just the last part about the timing of a new job and the ADHD meds** that has my mind fucking tizzied up. I just don't want to take a leap, say ""yes"" to this job (if I even get it btw) and find it so unbearable to even exist due to WDs that I have to embarass myself and quit. By the way, it isn't like my discomfort during K quits isn't VISIBLY NOTICEABLE TO ALL AROUND ME AT THE HEIGHT OF IT.

fuck my life man. can't wait to be over this

this was my ted talk

EDIT: I wanted to add this last part. When I read other threads, it appears that people are in a much more balanced position in life than I am save for their K habit. Unfortunately, I am not. I have a lot to work on. I'm emotionally all fucked up, I have two substances that are constantly pushing my brain out of whack (the K and the adhd meds - when I cease either my life is put on pause) and just feel like I don't have the mental and emotional fortitude to just say ""yup, two week CT quit and back to work!"". I almost feel like I need to rebuild my entire fucking life at this point. **What's the best course of action for someone in my current state based on the above?**",5,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.72465175}"

After 8 months of working my consulting job, I legit have $0 in savings. In fact, I’m in the negative because I owe money to a rehab center I went to for a week. I relapsed soon after getting back.

I’ve learned that no matter what, I can never put Kratom in my body ever again. After rehab, I told myself “just one more time.” Two months later, I’m taking more kratom than I ever have before. 

I am on a trip with the family in Tennessee. We’re at a cabin up in the mountains where there is no kratom that I know of. I won’t bother even looking, as this is my best shot at quitting. I will be here until Wednesday. 

Somehow day 2 is not awful. I have helper meds like Gabapentin, CBD, Valerian Root, and more. Managed to get some sleep last night with the help of all those. Did an intense hike yesterday, which probably helped reduce RLS. I think today we will just watch football. 

I did drink some alcohol today and this morning that I’m not proud of. The plan is to get to complete  sobriety. My parents only brought a little amount of booze. They know I’m in recovery. I snuck what I drank yesterday and this morning. I can only drink so much before they notice. 

Anyways. Love you all!",21,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45610738}"

I've read through tons of posts here over the years, but wanted some advice and to share . 

Backstory : 7 ish years of Daily Kratom, 20 grams start max 65 grams daily. Did a 1.5 year Taper from 65 to 6 grams. Jumped 50 days ago ish. 

Timeline : 
Day 1-10 : To be honest the first stage was mildly annoying and that's about it , no anxiety, felt pretty good by 48 hours. 
Day 10-25 :  Random and unexpected Brainfog/ Fast Heart / Vertigo / Fear of losing my mind / Sweety Palms and Feet / No endurance for excerise/ walking ETC.
Day 25 Till now ( 50 ) :  More of the above, but instead of happening 2 -3 times a week it's happening for a week or longer. 

Pretty much feels like random , long lasting panic attacks. Some points it's so bad I start to get depersonalization and feel like I'm littearly going crazy. 

I've always had anxiety issues, tho 100x more mild ( random brain fog when stressed / sometimes my face would feel flushed etc ) .

I used Kratom for pain, not anxiety. I have 0 history of opiate / drug use pervisouly so this is all new to me.

Main questions are. 

1. Why are the episodes random? I had 3 days recently felt "" fine "" then utterly horrible last 12 hours. To be quite honest my life is stress free with no major concerns. Day to day activities dont change much either so no triggers there.

2. How long until people started to get some symptom relief.  I seem to be progressing in the wrong way lol.

Lastly my anxiety is so bad even walking around the block / any tiny task can seem impossible and make things worse. Has anyone else had it this bad before ? 

I appreciate any feedback , I take no other meds other then Long Term BP meds. Also I got blood work done one month after I quit ( just random check up time ) and everything seemed inline so prolley nothing there.

Anyways good luck to all,  as someone that took Kratom for 7 years, if your thinking of quitting do it , shits going to stop working eventually and cause a bunch more problems then it solves.  Cheers",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6045517}"

Something to consider.  This nasty sludge definitely smears your shine.  You’re never quite the person you could be without it.  Make that step and quit.

Wish I could say this is my only issue but I am also an alcoholic, who drinks high amounts specifically in the evenings (at least not a day drinker. Have to have a career after all).

I've decided recently it's time to improve myself, I've realized the kratom issue has been the firm root of my problems that I neglected to even address for a long time now. Not that quitting kratom will solve everything instantly, but I think it is the correct foundation to tackle my recovery. I justified this habit for so long in a way that's straight up delusional, but I think I'm now in the right mindset to get through this.

I have been tapering off the best that I can and I have to say I'm improving at a better rate than I expected during my waking hours. However, the nights are my plague. I haven't been able to make the jump simply because of the insomnia, this has been by far the hardest WD symptom for me to accept mentally. I can get through a day without kratom now, but the nights still feel out of reach. 

Of course I've been using alcohol and other substances at night thinking these will help me get through a night without kratom, but it never works. I've read others' accounts of this problem but I would appreciate any suggestions from people in a similar situation. I know I'm fairly close and I truly want to kick this.

It had been well over a year since my last break and I just generally felt like crap so I knew it was time for a change. I woke up this morning feeling better than I can remember in years. Brain fog gone, energy through the roof, return of motivation to do things that Kratom had robbed me of. I got up today after only 4 hours of sleep, cut the grass, got groceries, winterized my camper, and then left for work. At one time I would’ve said this stuff is a life saver as it helped me stop a 3 year opiate dependency. But now, I see it for what it really is. If you’re trying to decide to quit, take my advice and do it now. I feel like I’m back to my old witty self, full of life and looking forward to enjoying things again.

1. Time is passing more slowly! A weekend feels like, forever now. Am I the only one who notices this time dilation effect? It really underscores how hazy things had become. Or that kratom folds time and mitragynine is from Arrakis. 

2. This morning I dispatched with dishes, laundry, and some other projects without even thinking about it. Before Kratom, Saturday mornings were always about spending a couple hours taking care of domestic shit. But I had become dependent on kratom to do them by the end. And even then, I started postponing to Sunday etc. For the last month, I've had to really concentrate on motivating. But today, I somehow did my usual routine without even thinking about it. Fellow Quitters, this is a huge success around a trivial activity. But it speaks volumes about the anhedonia and how far I've come.

3. Bad news dept: I'm still fighting waves of nausea and weird GI stuff. This seems to be my particular vulnerability as I did not have any issues with anxiety or thermoregulation etc. as many here do. I guess we're all different. Still, it seems like I have another few weeks to go on this front. It is a particular form of misery that I don't wish upon anyone.

4. A serious temptation to dose came up this week, but I fought it off. It was such a classic ""Just this once, to get through this pile of work and misery, and then you will resume quitting kratom."" I am very glad I fought that off, particularly because the feeling of CLEAN motivation I have today would have not been possible. I mean, either you're quitting or you're not.

I’m on Day 6 or 7 of a taper from 50+ gpd. Two days ago I took my last extract shot, and I’m doing powder capsules only now. It’s mid-afternoon where I live, and I’ve only done 7.2 g which I’m kinda shocked by. The past few days, I had major anxiety, depression, lethargy, I overthought everything, had hot and cold flashes, and I had the feeling that bugs were crawling on my skin.

I had a horrid panic attack last night, but I actually feel great today! I’ve only tapered with subs before, and I am not in the mood to prolong this or make quitting opiates even harder with a substance with a longer half-life, so I’m doing this taper with clonodine, a few gabapentin 600 mgs split in two to make 300 mg caps, delta 8 thc every third night, immodium, natural calm magnesium, and lots of endorphins (distance running and weightlifting). 

The hot and cold flashes have dissipated largely (were they mainly caused by the extract shots? I think possibly) and my skin feels normal again. I’m happy and positive like normal, and music is appealing again! For some reason I lost my interest in it recently - probably the depression from thinking I was gonna be stuck an addict forever. Only issue I’m having atm is keeping food down, but I’m telling myself it’s that sludge leaving my body.

Is it gonna be this easy every day moving forward? Probably not. Am I sticking with it this time? HELL YES. I am sooooo sick of headshops - they are becoming ubiquitous here. And I am even more sick of having to think “Imma need kratom” and “what if TSA confiscates my extract caps” when I travel lol.

If you’ve ever come off other substances, kratom may not be the most physically difficult. But if you’re like me and k has been integrated into your daily routine, it is a largely mental battle.

It’s amazing to me how bad I felt emotionally just ten days ago or so.  I’m prone to depression- I’ve been diagnosed with dysthymia- which is one step below major depression.  As a result of WDs from K I was experiencing major depression. Not quite suicidal ideation but really close.  Just bad, dark thoughts and a sense of hopelessness.   Just terrible feelings.  K really turns my brain upside down.  

Gotta hold onto this insight.  I’ve been trying to kick K for almost three years and gotten as such as close to 200 days.   I planned and booked an outdoor activity yesterday in six weeks.  It’s gonna be tough to do if I’m not in better shape.   Gotta figure out how to make this quit permanent.

I took it for six months before deciding to CT a 24 gpd habit. Worst fucking week of my entire life, no doubt. That was absolutely nightmare material. I made it 540 days (yep..I had an app) before being stupid enough to try it again. So once again, six months later, I knew what I was in for when I decided to CT again. Again, the anxiety and panic was maddening. So much that I went to the ER and begged for help. The nurse quietly told me that unless I was a danger to myself (wink wink) they were going to tell me to go home and tough it out. Fuck that. I couldn't deal with that again. So, I told them I was having bad thoughts and into the system I went. I slept alongside crack addicts and people with terrible mental illness for three days. Sounds horrible? Nope. I'd do it all over again because clonidine is amazing. Along with trazadone at night for sleep, I never felt even a twinge of withdrawl. Of course, I felt doped up but never anxious or wrecked in fear and despair like I had the first time. So...if you're going to CT, you might wanna find a way to source some Clonidine, even if it means a few days in the tank. They sent me home after two days with a week's supply and a few weeks of trazadone to help with sleep. Well worth the few days I had to take off from work. Good luck everyone.

Starting with about 10gpd but quickly going to around 15gpd by the end of the first month, and then 20-25gpd throughout the second month. 

I switched from capsules to raw MD powder for the last two weeks, but for some reason I could never get an effect out of it at all. Even 15g sludge in grapefruit juice. One morning I just decided that I was returning the bag of powder and never doing it again. 

I originally got into kratom to take the edge off of a ~12gpd phenibut addiction and taper. But it was becoming really obvious that I was getting addicted to kratom way quicker than I got addicted to phenibut. 
I’m currently at 6.5gpd of phenibut (worst idea of my life) and on day 3 of cold turkey kratom.

The chills have subsided a bit, but the spinal pain is really really bad. Worse than a day of heavy squats and deadlifts. 

Does anybody have any suggestions to lessen that pain? Normally I lift weights three times a week and do a lot of stretching in between—but now I’m feeling I won’t be able to do any of that, or that it may make things worse.
Or would it still be a good idea to fight through that pain and just not lift as heavy as normal?",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8422555}"

Yesterday was 4 weeks for me AND my stolen car got found!! It was stolen on Tuesday. The windows were shot out and it smelled like the dankest weed of all time on the inside, but it still drives lol. On the recovery part, wow. I have real.. energy. I still have minor morning anxiety, shortness of breath at times and sometimes a weird disconnected dizzy feeling but I can 100% deal with it and work through it. And that’s why I feel like I’m at or close to the light at the end of the tunnel, because the bad times are so minor and I’m able to deal with them now. Yesterday I ran errands (which I’ve found a way out of doing for months now. Not kidding I literally never leave my house.), did my nails and eyebrows for the first time in like 6+ months, cleaned up my house and made dinner. All of this felt absolutely impossible 4 weeks ago. Like a mountain that was unclimbable.  I never thought it would be possible to enjoy life again. Shit I even promised my best friend I’ve mentioned here before that I’d start working out this week and letting him train me again. I will admit, I smoked a few times to get through the hardest parts. Which may be fine for others, but I developed cannabinoid hyperemisis syndrome from abusing it a couple years ago so that’s really playing with fire for me. I haven’t gotten sick again so I’m going to count myself lucky and stop while I’m ahead and still feel good. 
In conclusion, if you’re in the darkest part of this I promise it gets better. Just keep pushing. Almost every weird and bad feeling you have seems to be directly related to withdrawal and it. Will. Pass. And one random day you’ll wake up like “holy shit, I feel better??” And it will come sooner than you think. This month has been the hardest but fastest month of my life. It feels like I quit a week ago and I can’t believe it’s been a month already. It sucked almost the whole time, but I truly feel like I’m getting back to my old self, maybe even a better version of myself. I can’t thank this sub enough for helping me get through this. There may be some bad days ahead because this isn’t linear, but I know I will be able to make it through now.

It's not even pain, just very uncomfortable...

If it gets even worse from here I'm probably taking a dose and trying another strategy, I cannot go multiple nights with this chest feeling. 

How's everyone else doing?

EDIT: day 2 so far seems to be much better. Still have headaches, a little body ache, general malaise, but I actually got (over probably 11 hours) about 6 hours of sleep despite the RLS and chest flutters (by far the worst PAWS). The chest flutters and RLS are for the most part gone, hopefully they don't come back tonight.

I was taking 50-70gpd for over 5 years. When you first quit, I’m sorry to say that there is no escaping the awful WD and getting little to no sleep in the first few days up to a week. It does get better with each passing day tho. I have been on this forum often and have read daim near every post. Here are the most common things that TREMENDOUSLY help get through he process easier. 

First things first. Gabapentin is a life saver the first week or two. (Be careful some say it can be addictive) I have not had that issue I stopped using it by week 2. It helps with RLS and anxiety, down part it makes you drowsy. I took 600mg each morning and 300mg at night. 

Next come the Wim Hof breathing exercises. I promise you they work! I have been doing them for a month. With every day it feels more and more amazing. Look it up on YouTube. The standard is 30 deep breaths followed by and exhale and hold for a min To a min and a half. Last night I did 100 deep breaths then exhaled and held for like 2 min. Your entire body begins to tingle and I swear you go into this zen mode. It’s insane and amazing. 

Then come the cold showers or baths, yes they suck but they help the first 3 weeks. It takes discipline to do them which is what most of us lack. It helps I recommend it the first few weeks. Hey you can’t feel WD when yo ass if freezing am I right? 😜

This last one and definitely the most important task is EXERCISE. You  ABSOLUTELY HAVE TOO EXERCISE. It helps more than anything, it keeps the mind busy. Start with walks.if you can go to my if not get some dumbbells and do it at home. You have all that negative energy buildup inside of you, I’m talking about anxiety, depression, and agitation. You have to convert that negative energy into a positive ie exercise. As addicts we tend to always replace one addiction with another, most of us are on kratom because of other drug abuse. Instead of replacing it with a drug replace it with exercise. 

Daim near every person on this subreddit who has successfully quit CT did one or all of these things.  The first 2 weeks suck. But we all have to go through them. It’s the price we must pay for freedom! My first 2 weeks were up and down. Good one day/hour sucky the next. On day 22 is when I felt back to 95% normal. No cravings, no WD, great sleep, appetite, energy, motivation. The only thing still healing is my stomach, but def much better than before. I choose diarrhea over constipation any day. 

The things I mentioned in this post not only made me a better healthier person, they tremendously helped go through this horrible process. Hope this helps. Good luck my fellow community! Love you all!",53,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.782314}"

My main scare and concern was the inability to even focus at work. I have been dosing kratom for going on 4 years now. It started, how many people begin, as a way to get off opiates. Mainly roxies and oxy. I started with just a few teaspoons a day. I enjoyed the way it made me feel and I felt amazing a work. So pretty much traded habit for habit. 4 years later and I’m up to nearly 50g to possibly more a day. Getting no effect only to just keep the awful withdraws away. This time around I am going with help from 8mg suboxone. I’ve heard positives and negatives from all sides. My doctor knows I don’t plan to be on it long either and I’m just trying to get passed the physical symptoms. I also have Hydroxyzine and Tizanidine for anxiety and muscle aches. I’ve heard of clonidine being a good supplement as well, but not until today. I’m so tired of washing kratom down. Every 2-3 hours. Feeling like I can’t be gone for long because I need to have my kratom at the ready. The non existent sex life. It completely destroyed my testosterone too.

I'm also excited to start this journey, but I have so much fear revolving around the acute withdrawals. I've ever quit before, ever since I started around 4 years ago, so I've never felt what the PAWS are like, so I'm pretty scared of that too. I know what the acutes feel like (made it 36 hours once and it was the worst feeling I've ever felt).

 My goal is to not relapse. I know that may be unrealistic, but I'm going to be confessing to my parents what has been going on, and I know that we'll come up with a plan so that I can't relapse.  I know that if I do relapse, it will be okay and I can start again. I know I can't be too hard on myself if it does happen, but I will do everything in my power to make sure it doesn't. I'll leave my money and credit cards with my parents, and only take small amounts of cash out with me when I need it.  I live with them, so I can't just order it and have it delivered here behind their backs.

I've been using kratom for almost five years now and tried quitting a few times, only to find my life miserable and hop right back on kratom.  I did a long, slow taper and I'm down to no kratom all day long, but just can't get to sleep for the life of me without taking two capsules.  I was sober 13 years before I found kratom and have a sobriety network that I'm tapping back into and going to meetings again.  I just wanted to get some support while struggling with the tail end of this and the coming months to follow without it.  I was up to 40 grams a day for the last year or so, basically just taking it again during the day whenever the effects dropped off.  To the newbie, that will seem like a lot, but as the years go by, it takes more and more and it's also more and more difficult to quit (as the last time I tried quitting I never had insomnia this bad and was able to walk off no problem at this point).  I know I'm going to get comments about just not taking the 2 capsules at night, which I'm working on, but the days I have tried that, it kept me up until 5am squirming and not sleeping and I have a business to run.  I did two days of no sleep and was too exhausted at work and being that I'm off kratom for the most part, I'm exhausted all day anyway.  Just wanted to throw my hat in the ring and join you guys on your journey.  I threw away about 12 kilos of kratom a couple months ago and all my kratom stuff (scales, containers, and capsule machines).  I don't want to be kratom's puppet anymore, having it tell me when to wake up and when to go to sleep at night.  Waking up in the middle of the night with withdrawal and waiting an hour for the RLS to go away (while squirming and hating myself for gettting addicted).  Having to always have it wherever I go and being in constant fear of the withdrawal.  I've been through the hell and I want off the ride.  Going the whole day without kratom now is the weirdest feeling ever - I'm just waiting to get broadsided by the withdrawal, but it's not there anymore.  Just the insomnia and RLS at night.  I'm so close and just need some support going forward.  Thanks for being here.",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6357588}"

Headache is a 6 on a scale of 10 
No restless legs (yet) 0
Anxiety is at a 0
Depression is at a 3 (I get to see my babies today!!!) 
Apathy is like a 5 (could also go back to sleep for another 12 hours or so) 
I’m cold and HUNGRY :) (too thin) 
My hair is still shedding but possibly not as much as it usually does 🙏🏻 
Started taking multi vitamin, biotin, elderberry w/zinc, vitamin C. 

For anyone that reads this I slowly lost my hair the past 3 months and it really picked up the last month for some reason. 
For reference I use to have mid-back beautiful long blond hair and full! Now it’s all scraggy brittle dry thin and uneven lengths and patchy (scalp) around the right side so can’t even wear it up or down. :/

This will be my journey if you care to follow. I will post the first week every day and then once a week there on out my progress. 

Only thing I’m using on my hair is The Ordinarys hair density serum twice a day.

Wearing beanies and baseball cap will have to do during the fall/winter season. :)


Day 2 waking up 
Cold sweats throughout the night 
Mild RLS
Took trazadone to help me sleep which works like a charm
Hair fall is still in full swing. I hope I’m
Left with something to work with. 
Lethargy is not too bad since I slept all day yesterday 
Depression is a 3. More apathetic. 
(Highlight TMI) I had a bowl movement for the first time without laxatives or enema yesterday for the first time in 6 months.

Day 3 has been the hardest. RLS in full swing. Even when I’m just sitting. Hair fall is a lot. It has to get harder before it get easier right? I’m so sleepy all the time. Miss the energy I got from kratom. But I miss my hair more!

Day 4 I woke up at 9am and couldn’t fall back to see. So unlike me. I didn’t sweat much last night. I had a little energy when I first woke up. Could of been the steroids for the sinus infection but I’m wiped out by noon time. 

My body doesn’t feel as wiggly today thank god. Last night was bad for that. My hair is still shedding like ever. I start a DHT blocker tomorrow I got off Amazon so we will see.

But now, I'm just tired all the time, depressed, anxious, not feeling well in general.  In the beginning, it was easy enough to say that this is all withdrawal stuff and I need to push through, get some exercise, etc. but I'm out of steam now.  At this point I can't say whether it is PAWS or just what I would normally feel like under the circumstances.  It has been long enough that I barely remember the acute WDs, much less the reason I stopped.  I mean I vaguely recall that it had gotten unsustainable but that's about it.  I'm not itching to get back on but I'm not really sure as to where to go from here.  I'm going to get a referral to a psychiatrist but I kind of feel like getting onto prescribed meds is just as bad.  I had a bad experience with an SSRI a while back and getting off that was almost as hard.  

I know the standard advice:  get out of the house, get some exercise, get some sleep etc.  But, in this state, I can't drive a car, I can't motivate myself to get dressed on the days I work from home.   My office is up in the hills so I do get a good hike in twice per week.  I also generally go for a climb at least once per week.  But, in the beginning of quitting, I was able to make it to the gym and now it seems impossible.  I can't sleep without melotonin and that crap makes me groggy the day after.

2021-10-20 00:50:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/qbt77f/46_yo_and_getting_ready_to_taperlooking_for/,"46 YO and getting ready to taper...looking for encouragement with my ""greatest fear""","Hello all, I am getting ready to begin my taper in November (I have a trip to take first and I'm waiting on different supplies and supplements to come in). I hope this post is ok with the sub rules not to post about active kratom use.

I would like to receive some support/advice and/or hear about personal experiences with quitting in regard to my ""greatest fear,"" so here it is:

\>>TL;DR: I am afraid I will never have focus or energy again because of the kratom AND my age.<<

Details:  Fears are rarely ""rational,"" of course, but here's why I have this fear:

A couple of years back, I made the choice to stop using an antidepressant I was taking after 20 years of use. I felt amazing, and I thought I was strong enough. I didn't really do it ""the right way,"" though, and I wound up going through hell with PAWS for about a year.  For 6 months I couldn't sleep more than an hour a night, I couldn't eat, I lost 35 pounds, I was having panic attacks from 8 AM - 4 PM every day, I had crazy agoraphobia that I had never experienced before, I was briefly suicidal...and it took me so, so long to recover and get my life back.  After a year I got much better, and ever since then, my greatest fear is to find myself in that state again, or anything similar where I find myself unable to work, take care of myself, participate in social activities, etc.

All that said...one of the things that caused me to increase my kratom use initially was that I noticed how much kratom helped me focus, feel effective, and gave me energy and euphoric feelings!  At first I was using little amounts, but you know the rest... and after 1.5 years of 25 GPD, I'm really, really scared.

I'm not scared of ""feeling bad"" for a bit.  And I'm gonna do this completely differently.  I have an arsenal of information, a team to support me, this forum, and so so many resources.  I've been preparing this time, like I didn't last time.

But I'm scared that once I complete this process, I will never feel right again!  I'll live a small life. I won't be able to concentrate on work or other projects and passions that matter.  I'm scared that now that I'm 46, society's ""head trip"" about being useless as you get older will turn out to be true for me (I have always been a very ""high powered"" person socially, athletically, intellectually, etc. until that last process ""took me down"" a few years ago).  I'm scared of the brain fog, I'm scared of the low motivation, I'm scared I'll never sleep again.

So I'm preparing.  I'm doing my research.  I'll be doing everything I possibly can including sharing my journey and asking for support here.  And right now I'm reading others' stories of quitting from a similar dosage and it's so, so helpful, but searching doesn't get you everything a specific request might.

In summary:  I would LOVE to hear about anyone who has quit kratom and reconnected to a well of energy, zest for life, mental clarity and focus, etc., ESPECIALLY if you had the same fears or had other similar experiences.  And what you went through to get it back.

Thank you so, so much for reading, I'm SO glad you're all here, and please feel free to reach out if you relate to my story.  I plan to begin on November 15, I'll post again, and certainly down to ""team up"" with anyone else intending on a similar quit (taper start) date!",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49226457}"

One week completely quit.,"A friend had turned me on to Kratom because of my back pain. Long story short, I have DDD beginning at 15 years old (now 36). I tried meds. Got hooked on Tramodol for a few years. Finally quit that cold turkey after dry heaving in front of my kids in the mall parking lot. Those withdrawals were probably the worst I’ve ever experienced. But I powered through and tried physical therapy, twice. I had many injections, nerve blocks, chiropractors, specialists… and after being fed up, decided to give K a try. It worked! I started feeling less pain. 

BUT, the side effects. Here’s a list and I may be missing a few:
- Severe hair loss. I probably have half the hair I did 4 years ago. 
- Urinary issues. Constant running to the bathroom and waking up at night to go. 
- Horrible sleep issues. I would fall asleep and wake up 3 hours later, unable to fall back asleep. This went on for 3 years. 
- Intestinal issues. I was not using the bathroom but every 4-5 days. And often had to use laxatives or enemas. 
- Weight gain. I’ve gained 20+lbs during my Kratom use period, which may or may not be related. But something tells me it was blocking absorption of essential nutrients along with backing up my intestinal tract. 
- Extreme anxiety/depression. I’ve always struggled with both, but the anxiety was 1000x worse. If I didn’t have my correct dosage or wasn’t able to access my dosage due to being out of the house, it would cause a panic attack. 
- Irregular heartbeat. I’m one week quit and still having palpitations that take my breath away. 

I finally decided last year during quarantine that I would start tapering. I was taking about 2tsp every two hours, all day. I went down to 1tsp every two hours for a few months. Down to 1/2tsp every two hours for another few months. Then down to 1/4tsp a couple times a day for a few months. Last week I dumped my stash down the toilet and haven’t looked back. 

My sleep has already gotten a lot better during the tapering process. No more urinary urgency at all. Now I’m hoping the hair loss begins to slow down and maybe even grows back! I don’t regret quitting for even a second! Hugs and love to all of you on this journey back to health!",28,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67570275}"

I initially started taking it to combat some panic attacks I was having, but those were gone within a few months. Obviously, the kratom use continued well beyond that.


I've ""quit"" once before (lasted about 3 months, this was over 5 years ago).


I guess I'm just here for some motivation and most importantly some accountability for myself. I want to be done for good. I'm hoping that posting here and making some friends will help me reach that goal.


My plan is to taper down a gram per day until I'm down to zero, and the do my best to ride out whatever withdrawals come after that.


On my previous taper, I allowed myself a single gram during the very worst nights of it, as it did help a tiny bit (even if it was all placebo). I plan on using that method again since I have to be a somewhat functioning adult no matter what (I have 2 young kids).

Maybe 5 failed quit attempts during the whole process. I had all of the classic symptoms that I’ve come to know- day 1-7 acutes, day 7-30ish PAWS/psychological pain (which was the worst from day 20-25 or so). The last few days I’ve been able to sleep through the night, no RLS, no social anxiety, pretty much back to “normal.” I’ve been relying on kratom for so long that I don’t really know what my baseline is, but all I know is I feel way better than I did the whole last month. For me, the acute phase was actually the easiest because I expect to feel like crap and embrace it. After 20 or so days I always expect to feel better, but don’t, and then feel incredibly disappointed and hopeless. To anyone in that phase who feels like it won’t end- keep pushing. I may still have some bad days ahead but I now feel confident that I’ve turned the corner and it’s all downhill from here.

Not my first one, but definitely an experience that made me realize I HAVE to quit. I don’t want to have to rely on this “benign” product anymore. I cannot carry around kratom for the rest of my life. I want to be able to function normally without it. I started about 3-4 years ago, started in small doses, and would go through about a half kilo every month with my ex-wife. I definitely took more than her and now take even more. I’m going through approximately 1 kilo every 3 weeks. I dose multiple times a day, generally “smaller” doses of ~1 -2 tablespoons throughout the day with a heavy dose at night. I forgot to take a dose before bed tonight and woke up unable to sleep, unable sit still, skin crawling, anxiety, and the worst craving I’ve ever had. My girlfriend has been very supportive. I have been completely open with her about taking it since we started dating. We live together now. I’ve mentioned quitting to her before and I told her tonight I can’t live like this forever. I told her tonight that I need to take some time off from work to do this. I’m an ER RN and don’t know how I will safely function without it. Our plan is for me to start actually weighing out my doses (as I should have from the beginning) and then begin some tapering off. We plan to take a week or two off to really concentrate on symptom management. I know this can be a longer road than that, but I have to start somewhere. I’ve noticed I don’t think about the “next dose” as much when we are enjoying ourselves (fishing, hiking, working out,etc). There isn’t a whole lot of science on symptom management so I am open to all anecdotal experiences to figure this out. I started taking kratom trying to avoid opioids. I deal with chronic pain due to early osteoarthritis of my hip and knee after the military and years of beating my body. I’ve had multiple family members die from opioid abuse and did not want to even peak down that road. In the past (prior to becoming a nurse) I dealt with the physical pain with small amounts of THC, I know trading one substance for another is not the best idea, but the pain is very mentally debilitating. I am not addicted to any other substance. I drink alcohol occasionally socially and consume a lot of caffeine, but not any other substances. I also stay pretty active.

I've been a 30g-40g a day user since about the start of lockdown March 2020. Why? Because you're working from home and it's all just sitting there!

Prior to that, I had an event that freaked me out March of 2019... That made me a daily user. I found out in October of 2019 on a week long trip that... ""congratulations, you are now physically dependant on this crap!"" couldn't sleep for shit the whole week. My withdrawals are the kitchen sink. Anxiety attacks, heart palpitations, night sweats, and RLS. The RLS is especially maddening. It's literally like the most annoying tickle under my right armpit. It will not stop.

But i also didn't stop. I started taking it even more after that realization. Now I can get withdrawals during the middle of the day. Yay me!

I started taking kratom early 2016. So, for nearly 3 years my game was to take a big dose all in one session every 3 days. Like 30g+. I've taken weeks off in between with that regimen. Other than occasional bitchiness, no big deal. So my anecdotal theory is its more the frequency of doses than the amount. Both are bad in the end obviously. I'm not even super anti kratom, but if you have an addictive personality and weak will power, stay away! 

Anyway, I was doing fairly well these last 2 weeks. Probably about 3g-4g of kratom a day. Sometimes less. Hirsuta actually works for me so far. Doesn't do anything exciting, but knocks out the withdrawals.

Ashwagandha has been pretty good as a subtle mood lift, valerian root to sleep or to chill out a bit. I take magnesium citrate for constipation and I hear it's good for RLS (yes I know it's not actually RLS, the withdrawals just mimic RLS).

Anyway the main point of my blabbing is I took so much kratom to see if I could recapture that old fire. Not only did I feel nothing, I took so much i barfed 3 times. I guess that's a God send in its own way. If I took enough to barf, but didn't feel anything, then what's the point at all?",10,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40507558}"

I remember first taking kratom when my sister’s boyfriend had me pick some up for him. He was like “this stuff is great, and it’ll help you cruise effortlessly through your day. Best part, it’s only as addicting as coffee.”

That was in 2018. Was on K for 22 months and quit last year for 4 months during the pandemic. Went back on again from August 21st 2020 til September 26th of last month. This freaking stuff..

As a whole, I’m doing probably better than I deserve. But coming off this stuff and dealing with life completely sober has been kind of a mindf*ck. Not liking where I’m at in life is the hardest part. Granted I just opened my own business but it’s the stress and worry of it succeeding and then moving back in with parents to save money for a house that’s getting to me mostly. Now I know why I stayed on it for so long. It masked everything and gave me some sort of happiness for a few times a day that helped me deal with my current reality. But who can ever get ahead with an addiction? 

I know there’s light at the end of this. I do a lot of meditation and visualization for manifestations and today I spent some time crying over how good it felt to visualize the better life I have for myself and to actually feel the emotions. We may think kratom makes us feel but it puts us at a much lower vibration because we don’t know how to feel the natural way.

One day at a time it WILL get better. It’s an uphill climb for sure, I just can’t wait to get to the part where life starts for me again. And it will start for all of us if we keep going. I used to think I wasn’t a strong person for letting myself become addicted to a drug like kratom. And I wasn’t.

But I just wanted to ask here, because when I first researched Kratom it also often said it was totally safe which is obviously BS. :-)

My main question is not the general safety of CBD because there are quite some scientific papers on that, but especially taking CBD while on Kratom WD - because there's not any specific scientific information on this.

First of all I want to apologize for my English I use the translator: D.
 Well, on March 14, 2021, I tried kratom for the first time, a friend recommended it to me, it's great, you'll feel good about it, you'll have energy, you'll be productive, etc ...
 So I started taking it and yes I felt good, energetic, productive and all around.  I took it, I took a break for 7 days then I only took it on Fridays and then every other day and so differently now everything was fine.  The last break was July 12, 2021 and it lasted a month and five days.  Everything was fine just the first four days I had a problem with sleep and then good.  I ended the break after that month and five days and started taking kratom again until October 12, 2021. That day I took 3 grams in the morning and everything was fine in the garage and so, I took 3 grams again in the afternoon, but I started  have weird thoughts of anxiety and all these inconveniences like when you eat grass and it doesn't suit you.  I thought I would wake up in the morning and it would be good, but there was no anxiety that continued until today, October 17, 2021, the day when the anxiety started, so I say I end up with a short time, it's not worth it.  I haven't taken kratom since, but I still have anxiety and dark thoughts today, it's the fifth day.  I have to say that the third day in the afternoon was nice, I played with my cousins, he was out with his family and I was absolutely happy, but the next day I don't want to be alone anymore, I don't feel good ...
 It should be noted a month I was at home I had torn quadriceps my regimen was such that I went to bed at 3 in the morning woke up at 12 in the morning and in the morning I was without energy I felt a little shit, but I had a short time and everything was fine,  this is how it went until that day.  Interestingly, in the evening around 7-8 I feel fine, but during the day bad frequent cold anxiety, thoughts and feeling like I'm out of my body strange feeling in my head like the day after the party after alcohol.  It helps me to be out of the barracks during the day, but it's still not me, I'm going to work tomorrow, so hopefully it will be better.

 So my question is, will I get out of it when I actually started to feel anxious about the condition on kratom?  And now I don't take it for 5 days and I'm still not feeling well?

 My consumption was about max 15 g per day.  But that's only about 3 times differently, I took 3 g in the morning, 3 g in the afternoon, 3 g in the evening.

He was supportive at first but with how bad and dangerous my withdrawals were he became angry with me and we may have called off our engagement and be done. I have no idea. I’m going very well today, requiring 1/3 the detox meds and for the most part feel good just a little tired and weak. I can’t believe getting off of this shit has been the ending factor right now. He was caring the first day but a jerk the last 4. He blamed me for not researching what I put in my body- I TRUSTED the friend who told me about Kratom clearly I will never be making that mistake again. I’m off it for good now and it was one of the hardest things I’d ever done. I’m hurt, I’m angry at him and I’m sick of being made to feel guilt about my chronic illnesses. He’s a cop so I know he will use this to try to railroad me. I am a fucking phenomenal mom. My daughter was born early and I quit working and have dedicated my entire life to her and her dad, including leaving all my doctors, family and friends behind when he wanted to move across the county. I went into toxemia when I was pregnant and it was bad so she was born at 31w 5d via emergent c-section. As of now at 11 months I’ve worked with her daily and she is fully caught up on all of her milestones, she’s in the average percentile for weight and above avg. for height. I am scared if we split he will try to use this against me even though I quit. I’m sad, grateful I am over the worst of it all but hurting. I have zero want to take that sludge ever again but hate that this will be held against me.

I spent years self medicating with alcohol and pills. I eventually reached a low point with my addiction where I knew it would ultimately kill me if I did not make some drastic life changes. This led me to the v.a. where dr.s prescribed a variety of pharmaceuticals along with therapy. I was very hesitant to take prescription drugs but along with a substance abuse therapy program, I took gabapentin and at first did not have any major issues, but overtime developed some extreme side effects from the gabapentin that took me a year to taper off of. 

While tapering off of the gabapentin, I started taking kratom as a natural pain alternative to relief my withdrawal symptoms.  For awhile it worked great and I did not have any real negative effects from taking it.  Slowly overtime I started to hear it talk to me more and more. I began taking it through out the day and would get nauseous and irritable if I went more than a couple hours without taking a tablespoon.  I also started to notice that it was becoming a much longer and slower process everytime I needed to use the restroom and my libido went to zero. I had zero energy and had a harder and harder time staying focused on work and school. Eventually,  I connected the dots(i.e. was honest with myself) and tried to stop but the restless legs and insomnia were unreal and I new more extreme measures would be in order.

Thankfully, I'm connected to a community of medicine healers in South America and was able to go down and surround myself with a community of shamans to help me detox and work with plant medicines to break my addiction and detox in a safe environment. 

I am now 7 days clean of kratom and am already doing much better.  For me, it was 5 days of zero sleep. Trying to burn my limbs off with hot water every hour to ease the restless limbs and wanting to rip my skin off and run from my body. 5 days of pure hell. Minor symptoms included chills, sneezing, runny eyes and a stuffy nose..

..But then, my plumbing improved, my digestion issues decreased, my libido came back and I've slept a full night 2 nights in a row! I am still having some minor symptoms and restlessness but believe I am over the mountain and am so grateful I quit drinking that sludge before it got any worse.

To anyone having issues and wanting to quit I say you can do it and it's soo worth it! Prepare yourself to know it is going to suck really bad for a few days but if you can commit, surrender and not give in to the temptation to make the pain stop, the horizon ahead is soo much better.  If you can taper even better but for me the bandaid approach was the only way to get that shit out of my system. Best of luck to all of you!

I’ve posted in here a few times before, this is my fifth (I think, I lost count honestly) time trying to get off Kratom.

I heard it takes domestic violence victims, on average, seven tries to leave their abuser. I wonder if the same may ring true for K, or any substance?

I started dating someone new who is extremely perceptive. He knew something was up, I knew I couldn’t hide it forever from him. One day, he asked me “is there anything you’re not telling me?” (he knows about my K problem) and I straight up lied. Nope, everything’s good here. He goes “then why do you take your bag with you every time you leave the room?”

I was leaving to dose every 2-4 hours. I got back up to 20 GPD (I am a 115 lb female). I was always high or sick.

Thank god he’s in recovery as well and was understanding when I finally let the truth out. He said something that made me think. “Is Kratom really that bad for you?”

I started to wonder, is this addiction equivalent to something like a caffeine addiction? No, it can’t be, I dismissed that fairly quickly. It’s literally the exact same feeling as an opioid. It’s an opioid agonist. I’m getting HIGH regardless of whether it’s K or a pill.

And it’s even more disgusting because of the amount that we have to take just to maintain. The other day, I was swallowing my ten caps, a few of them got stuck in my throat as usual. I went to sit down and I braced myself for the K burp. This time, when I burped, green dust literally flew out of my mouth because the capsules had dissolved stuck in my throat.

I then thought about the reality of what I was doing. I am ingesting absurd amounts of disgusting green powder into my body for it to digest. The capsules alone can’t be good for my system, let alone the K itself.

Anyways, I’m trying again. I hope this time I can stick to it. I wasn’t going to post because I am embarrassed that I am going through this again. But I need some motivation to get up, get my shit together and live my life.

Then I went from one gram a day to ?. From one time a day to 4-5. I believe it was slowly killing me to a point I could not function without it. I had tried CT prior but only made it to day 5. A year later I’m almost 3 weeks in and past the majority of the physical withdrawal symptoms. On day 3 I woke up with my hands and feet tingling and numb. They continue to be that way today. I’ve been reading other posts but have not seen any with those symptoms that continued this long. I’m hoping the numbness goes away as I’m finally starting to feel good again!

My system isnt normal on massive kratom doses, but it feels normal to me because ive adjusted to the life. 

Now that im about 2 weeks out and my bodily functions are starting to return to normal it feels like a scene in a movie where an alien or a robot or whatever occupies a human body for the first time and and has to ask all these stupid questions because of how unfamiliar it all is like ""My stomach it feels... like it is angry with me, what is this?"" and someones gotta be like ""oh, thats hunger. Youre hungry, dude"" and im like ""hm, hunger.. I do not like it"".

On kratom I experienced emotions, but always just highs and lows, everything else was too comparatively subtle to recognize, real emotions muted. On kratom I was never sick, always just sorta invincible minus the low level sickness that exist every moment of the day that I was able to tune out. On kratom I was always tired but always awake, sleep was nice but I could also go without if I had to. On kratom my only priority was to feel good constantly.

Now coming out and making those readjustments. Finding out that I get hungry, finding that I need to use the bathroom regularly, finding out that I feel things deeper for better or for worse, finding that I have an ear ache and can feel pain and be sick. Its humbling.

I hung out with friends for the first time since the kick yesterday. It was so strange interacting with people without my social high. But I felt good. Im still myself. Still funny, still the center of attention with all my bullshit, but I felt kinder towards my friends. I was listening more. I wasnt hyper and rambling. Kratom was a secret, no one knew that i had an issue, no one knew that I went through the detox, but many people commented on how healthy I looked, and that my eyes were bright, and I had a more positive energy about me. When they asked what changed I just said ""ive been taking b-vitamins and tumeric"" and then turned and winked at the camera. 

But what I mean to say is with all that ive been learning and feeling, the most important thing im recognizing is that everything is ok outside of kratom. The fear of letting go is harder than the withdrawal. The idea that its what I needed to be happy. Any time youre not sure you can go without, thats the ghost of the drug in your brain trying to fuck with you. All that use over time imprinted that way of thinking. Reality is better. Life is still hard, but its better to be present for it, so you can work on the difficulties and create solutions, instead of hiding from your problems under green dirt-water euphoria. 

Even though I got a stomach and ear ache right now, even though im a bit depressed from this and that, even though i still got low mood and lethargy, I feel grateful to be back in the land of the living. The semblance of control returning is anchoring in my sobriety.

The big news this week is that my sleep has finally converted. I slept 7-8 twice, which hasn't happened in a long time. I'm not sure if other people had trouble while on kratom, but it was messing with my sleep.

However, with the new hours of sleep I am more tired and brain dead during the day. This is maybe counter-intuitive, but it seems like I don't quite ""wake-up"". I feel oddly chill and relaxed though, so compared to feeling jittery and RLSy and tweeky all the time, it's kind of nice despite the lack of motivation. It seems like my brain is just not sharp.

GI was good for several days but the last 24 hours it seem to be off again. Pain and rumblings. Not sure when the digestive drama will subside, but am looking forward to it.

IT'S TEMPTATION TIME: For the first time since wd began I thought, ""Maybe I should just do one dose tonight, you know, for the energy and socialization bit. Just once, tonight. Then I will stop.""

I said no...

For the first couple years of my kratom use, I only did it once a week. And if I could have kept it there, maybe it would not have been a problem. But the pandemic and isolation and creeping up in dose made me dependent in the end. 

The upsides to being off are numerous and I need to recognize them here for my own therapy, if I may. The house is clean. My moods are more even, if a little sleepy. I'm also thinking out several weeks to stuff rather than just getting through the days and weeks like they are a struggle. Time itself seems to have changed and the days are longer. I get more life in fact. I'm sleeping well. Even the joint/back pain I was taking it for is not any worse. And at the risk of TMI, my boners/nut are back in full force and volume. I did not realize that my drive and um, capacity, had been so attenuated.

Really, I'm doing pretty well except for a certain mental dullness and the GI thing. Once those symptoms pass (maybe in another month?) I will considered this unpleasant phase of my life over.

I began a taper in May and ultimately jumped on July 7, 100 days ago.

Fortunately, I never suffered from RLS, so the whole thing was not even close to being as painful as some of the reports on this sub. With the taper and being able to redose at night, sleep was not that big of an issue either. 

Sure it was not a joyride. Ever since I quit, I am getting sick all the time. Also I had diarrhea every few days until around day 85.

for anyone who is thinking about quitting or in the beginning stages of quitting (like myself), here is what my recovery timeline has looked like so far...

week 1: i was surprisingly active and motivated my first week going CT but i still felt low-key depressed and anxious. thanks to my long taper, i didn't have RLS and was sleeping pretty well throughout the night. that's why i recommend tapering down for a while before going CT if you can. i was doing hot yoga, going on bike rides, and exercising in the morning but nothing made me feel happy. there was no spark. i actually felt very depersonalized and like nothing was real. i was convinced my brain was broken.

week 2: i felt like absolute hell during week 2. mind you, i made the idiotic decision to drink after my first week going CT and i swear i had a 5-day hangover. alcohol is a depressant, so when you're putting a depressant in your body when you're already depressed...it's very bad. i wanted to die. i was crying all day, hated myself, had no motivation to cook, shower, work out, nothing. i ""worked from home"" and laid in bed all day doing the bare minimum.

week 3: my fiancé nicknamed me ""miss 180"" at the beginning of week 3. 😂 i went from wanting to die to waking up one morning with a fire up my ass and wanting to conquer the world. i started running every day to get feel-good chemicals pumping in my brain again. i felt motivated to do household chores again, take care of myself, and even socialize without kratom or alcohol. we went on a double date last night and it was surprisingly fun and refreshing.

currently: i'm starting to get cravings now but as soon as i go on a run or meditate, it passes. my new mantra is ""show loving kindness to yourself."" i'm starting to recognize when my addict brain is telling me lies and when my higher self is telling me to stay on track. i also highly recommend therapy to anyone who is dedicated to their recovery journey. it has really helped me check in and be honest with myself while getting unbiased advice from a professional. i've been going to her for probably 2 years now and i love her! i hope this helps at least one person who is looking for guidance and answers.",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.78515023}"

  I would like to tell you my story
  I am 25 years old, in good physical , always positive, in a good financial position
  It all started with ecstasy, I sometimes took it once every 1-2 months
  I never drank alcohol, I don't like it
  There is only nicotine addiction
  Once, after another party with friends, when I was really bad, I started reading on the Internet about how to reduce side effects, I read on the forum that there is Kratom , witch can help
  In my country, it is  legal and you can buy it in 5 minutes, I did it
  For the first time, these feelings are difficult to describe, euphoria, communication, motivation, I think everyone here knows this
  at first I took 5 grams / 3 times a week
  But when the effects began to last less, I, like everyone else, began to increase the dose.
  As a result, I took kratom for 1 year, and reached 15 grams every day.
  I no longer felt the effect, I took it only to feel normal
  I tried to leave him half a year ago, I was without him for a month, but for some unknown reason I bought it again(
  I am now on 6 days CT
  As soon as I stopped use it, my immunity was dead
  I have not slept for 2-3 hours 5 days
  Only today I fell asleep normally for the first time
  I'm not enough experienced, but I can tell you what helped me:
  -vitamin c 1000
  -Magnesium for sleep
  -exercise every day
  - The best thing that helped me to stop my addiction last time was to fly on vacation, I did not think about Kratom there at all, except for physical pains for 2-3 days

  I want to tell you that, so that you do not return back to kratom, you need to find the reason why you accepted it and solve it
  You need to enjoy life whatever it is!

I tried quitting cold turkey about a week ago and I tossed and turned in bed. Skin felt like it was crawling and if my blanket was on I was sweating but if I took it off I was freezing. I was finally able to sleep but when I woke up at 2am my bed was drenched. Can I do this safely without rehab? Ironical enough I work at a kratom bar so I don’t pay for it. I probably drink around 30g a day and honestly thought kratom was my saving grace for quitting alcohol and antipsychotic meds (bipolar + struggled with addiction been to rehab for it etc) I’ve never had an opioid addiction before but from being through rehab and AA for years I’ve heard horror stories. If anyone could share some safe ways to quit that don’t include me getting sick or checking into rehab I would greatly appreciate it. My life finally feels like it’s gotten on track and I’m even willing to just take a few milligrams a day if it’s safe. Please help :/,10,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.50746816}"

The vast majority of us are here for reasons that are much deeper than a kratom addiction.  I'm currently battling the trifecta of kratom, porn addiction, and nicotine.  I'll be honest with you all, I've had the most fucked up year of my life this past year.  At skin level, you might see a business professional with a good education who has his shit together.  And maybe that's why I began my K use 3 years ago.  Expectations of who I'm supposed to be.

The reality is, I've been harboring a childhood trauma so deep in my soul that I'm just beginning to face it in my mid 30's.  I've now realized that ""this miracle plant that has cured my anxiety, self hate, and depression"" is total bullshit.  All kratom did was add another layer of 'protection' to help numb me from the core issues that I've been always running away from.  Friends...this shit messed me up.

Over the past 1.5 years I started to develop crazy symptoms leading to me being tested for cancers, HIV, ALS, MS, Parkinsons etc... But here's the thing.  All of my tests kept coming up clean.  And what was I doing?  Using more kratom to help deal with the anxiety of being tested like a lab rat for the worst things you can be tested for.  I became numb.  I became a living ghost; a shell of myself. I looked AWFUL.  I lost my fiancé.  I slipped down a very dark hole.

So I found myself at my lowest point.  I had two options in my mind.  Leave....or get the fuck up and try to find the beauty in this struggle.  I got up.  I began therapy for the first time in my life.  I've faced, unpacked, and accepted my past.  I've began to heal.  I got back into the gym 6 days a week.  I started daily meditation and breathing exercises. Gratitude.  I've drastically cut down my porn use (this has been my biggest challenge, it's work in progress but I'm doing well), I got back on dating apps and have been on a few dates,  I'm learning how to love myself - something I've never truly done.

As I cut down on the kratom my symptoms began to improve, like magic.  I've currently tapered down from 16+ GPD to 2 GPD.  I've been sitting at 2 GPD for a 1 week now.  I'm going to make the jump soon...but I'm scared.  Its's the PAWS and mental side of it, for me.  But I know that the more I work on myself, the easier it will be to find my true self, my good self, and I won't need kratom to hide who I am anymore.

If you've read this.  Thank you.  I just needed to dump this on paper.  I can't put into words how much this subreddit has helped me on my taper journey.  I've been lurking daily.  It's so important to remember that we're all beautiful people looking for help, acceptance, love, and guidance in a tough world.  We all have our own story.  My advice would be to really dig deep and learn the reason as to WHY you need kratom.  Once you find that ""why"", and you accept that ""why"", well my friends.... That's where the journey of true self love begins.  And no substance can replace that inner happiness.

Wish me luck on my jump.  Not sure when it will be, but it will be soon.  Any advice is welcomed.  Any questions I'll answer.  Love you all.",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.70894575}"
2021-10-14 19:49:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/q8bt44/you_can_do_it/,You can do it!,"Like many people, I started with what seemed like a reasonable dose (2-3g) which slowly crept up over time.  I first started because it helped with my allergies better than anything I’ve ever taken.  Also, as last year continued to get more stressful, it helped with anxiety.  Eventually, the lymph nodes under my armpits became extremely inflamed.  Thankfully, I came across this as a somewhat of a common issue by way of this group.  

The lymph nodes scared me so I tapered down from 15-20g per day to 3-5g and then went CT.  

The worst parts were missing the morning “ritual” and starting the day warm and fuzzy as well as the RLS.  Intensive exercise, SAMe, and Hyland’s Restful Legs were the most helpful things.  I occasionally used phenibut to help with sleep on rough nights but I wouldn’t recommend that unless you do a lot of research on it.  Mega dosing the Hyland’s helped about the same so I eventually just did that instead of phenibut.  Of course, there were also bouts with random sweats, feeling generally blah, and many of the other normal wd things.

I dosed 1-2 times early in getting off it because my allergies were particularly bad (and/or to help nurse a hangover tbh) and my lymph nodes let me know nearly immediately not to do that.  That’s a scary side effect.  

I’m about 6-8 weeks out from Day 0 and most everything is back to normal except for the lymph nodes.  They’re trending  down but very slowly.  They occasionally flare but then will go back down.  I no longer need anything for RLS and sleep is fine with my normal melatonin. 

On the days where I feel particularly bad because of allergies, I do miss it.  However, the lumps under my armpits are a reminder to just deal.  

I used to think I would give myself the liberty to occasionally dose when my body is back to normal.  For example, if my allergies were particularly bad or if I had some pain to manage.  I no longer see that as a viable thing.  I don’t want it in my life anymore.

If you’re struggling, you can get through it.  It can be rough early on but it’s worth it.  You can be free and more healthy.  You do not *need* it.

I've been hiding it for about three years. I am embarrassed, and I know she thinks I did ""something"" and she has hardly spoken to me since Sunday. That's fine, I'm quitting for me, not her - if I have to hide something and take it in secret and it's costing me 60-100 dollars a week, I need to stop.

Currently I have been taking 75 capsules a day - 25 three times a day.

Previous efforts to quit have been when we have travelled out of town, and I don't take anything with me - but I ALWAYS find a smoke shop and time to get to it on the down low to purchase some after a day.

For me the roughest part of quitting has been the restless legs/being unable to sleep the first three nights or so.  I took my last 25 caps at four pm yesterday and flushed the rest down the toilet - its four pm right now, so its now been 24 hours, and I know the roughest patch is to come.

I planned to try and get through the night sweats/rls/insmonia primarily over the weekend so I am not a zombie at work - so that means having one work night (thursday) and one workday (friday) where things will be rough. I KNOW that I will be really tempted to go buy some over the course of the next few days - I just need to stay strong and tell myself that I have wasted the one or two nights of sweating through getting off this sludge if I do that.

I bought some Hyland's Restless Legs PM and some MD. Life Restless Legs capsules and will take both tonight. I know it's gonna be a grind.

I can't live like this!,"(First and foremost I am not a native speaker so I apologize for any grammatical mistakes in advance.)

Long have I thought that I can manage and overcome my addiction on my own. Long have I falsely persuaded myself that it is not as a big of a problem and that it is not something I need to talk or open up about. Well, today I've reached my personal bottom and I realized that I can not do this alone.

Let me start at the beginning. I've started taking kratom roughly about two years ago. Mainly because I suffer from anxiety and panic attack from a young age. At that time I was in an unfullfiling and pretty depressing relationship but that it a long story in itself. I was introduced to kratom by my (at that time) friend. From the first time I took it I fell in love with it as it not only diminished my anxiety but it also made me see the world in ""brighter colors"". Without kratom I would have ended that relationship in the span of maybe two months. ""Thanks"" to it I managed to stay in that relationship for almost another two years. 

At first I did not take in daily or in great quantities. I took it maybe three times at week, max 4gpd. After a month, I unconciously started to be a bit reckless. When anxiety creeped up or something slightly negative happenned between me and my (at that time) girlfriend I would dose outside of my schedule and soon after, what was occasional, became regular and I begun to dose daily. I increased my doses because I would tell myself, that I do not want to feel anxious or have to deal with the pressure of my relationship or my life. 
I wanted to go to college but for the sake of being able to afford kratom and to save my girlfriend from her abusive family by taking her into the house of my parents and paying for her school and other expenses I went to work. I worked a pretty shitty job at the time where my boss would mistreat me and never paid me on time. But every problem that arised, I would solve with dosing more a more, until the point where I did not really care about it. I lied to my girlfriend and to myself that it is ""just a tea"" and I can not be addicted to it. 

Than, 7 months into my habit (I took 20gpd at the time for the last 2 months) I went sort of broke and I could not afford to buy more of it. I had to take care of my gf and I could not afford to buy any more of it. And so I went through my first withdrawal. The shock that it is real and the psychological side of it, made the physical withdrawal very bad. I must tell you that I was never addicted to anything before. I was obliterated by anxiety and extreme sadness and shame. My body felt like I layed in ant's nest. After a week it past and I did not touch kratom for the next 2 months. But I haven't felt as happy, calm and content as before. I missed it very much and it was hard for me to cope with my relationship and all that anxiety again. I was weak. I was absolutely sure, within myself, that I have no power over my life and that I could not do anything to change it. So, after those two months I ordered kratom again and the whole cycle begun anew.

After 2 months I stopped again but after 5 weeks I went back to it. 

For a year now I am in this ""on and off"" relationship with it but not because I decided to but because I went broke so many times and I could not afford another batch. For a year I am at 30gpd. I worked only to afford it. Even if the job was miserable, I was thankfull for every piece of coin and I immediately bought kratom. When I've had the last dose I would almost panic and I could not imagine a day without it.

I went through unwanted withdrawal (for one to five days) so many times since, that I've became almost acustomed to it and many times I was determined to never take it again. But when I could afford it again and when my package arrived and I opened it, sometimes I almost cried from happines and I ate 30 grams in two hours. I could afford only 50-100g packages so in two to three days I've had nothing again.

Today, I almost borrowed money from some shady online company, just to afford another batch. Maybe fate wanted it so and they refused to lend me that money. After that, something has broken inside me and I was terrified of myself. I am disguisted of the THING I have become. I am so weak, so stupid. I can not look at myself in the mirror because I see only failiure. How could this happen...?

I have to stop. I need help, please, I beg you, anyone. If you can help me, if you can give me advice how to change this mentality. I can live through withdrawal even if I am always afraid of it at first. My mind is the problem.

I am now 20 years old. I had dreams, I worked hard on them but then my life went south (it is not only because of that one girl, there were more things). Now I am a broke husk, living only for that green sludge. I do not want this to be my youth, or my whole life. My family can not help me as we do not have good relationship (it is very complicated and personal). So, I came here. I saw, that there are many great and understanding people here.

I never allowed my receptors to fully recover and was probably the reason I was still feeling a little depressed. According to the dopamine theory of addiction, this would be true with all substances not just kratom. So I'm quitting everything today including nicotine. I'll reevaluate myself in 1 month to see if I want to moderately use weed or alcohol, but kratom and nicotine are hopefully done for good.

Recently been struggling with stacking up consistent days. I made it to 19 days after a pretty quick taper, but over the past few weeks I have been taking for a few days (same amount as before, 20-25 gpd) then taking a few days off. I want to be done, there’s really no good in me using at all anymore. I’ve quit quite a few substances over the years, but I have to say this one is proving to be one of the hardest. I’m wondering what people’s experience has been with multiple quit attempts and when it finally stuck.

Just wanted to do a quick share to maybe help someone else and to also keep myself accountable.

4 weeks ago I stopped taking Kratom CT.  For me, what finally worked was placing myself in a situation where I would be unable to obtain any kratom.  In this case it was during a field training exercise (in the military).  

I’d tried and failed tapers and CT many times before and this is what finally worked for me.  If I had to do it again, I would probably take 48-72 hours and go camping someplace remote just to get over those initial withdrawal symptoms and render myself unable to run to the store for more.

Some other things that have really helped for me were kava, Tazo herbal teas (brewed strong), and coffee.

My biggest hurdle was the RLS symptoms and those are just now finally going away.  I could not believe I was still experiencing withdrawal symptoms at 21 days but there it was.

If you’re like me, you’ve probably been lurking on this subreddit for awhile envisioning quitting.  I would say jump in with both feet and do it now!  I used kratom for 3 years and everyday for 2 and it fk’n sucked.

It’s nice not having to skip/plan meals around when I’m gonna be dosing the sludge.  It’s nice taking normal BMs again.  I’m starting to feel much better day to day.  Believe in yourself and quit this horrible bs!",16,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.49891552}"

This is my first post on Reddit so I don't know if I'm posting in the right place. If not, sorry.After a year of using it, I'm here and I feel like I need to quit because I can't take it anymore. I use 20-30 grams a day and I feel like I'm underwater all day. I'm sick of it all. I'm sick of waking up in the morning with withdrawal symptoms. I'm sick of not being able to talk to anyone if I haven't had kratom. I'm sick of lying to my family and friends. I am sick of my life being controlled by Kratom and not by me.

I have struggled with addictions all my life. I want to be free at last.

Tomorrow I start my quit. Cold turkey. There is no other way for me. I can't taper, I've tried, but I can't control myself.  
I am writing here because I need all the help I can get. A kind word or a word of encouragement is enough. I can do it! 

**Thank you all <3**

30-50gpd user for 7 years on and off, but mostly on the last 5. Last year has been roughly 35-45ish. Did a rapid taper over about 2 weeks then jumped when I hit 1. No helper meds. No support besides this sub.

Last few days of taper and first 3 days off were rough. Typical symptoms of withdrawal, which mostly subsided by day 7 (The only physical symptom that lingered was the feeling like lead throughout parts of the day, which seemed to clear around week 3). 

A roller coaster then began. Days of feeling great, followed by days of feeling down and worthless.. After around day 10/11, I noticed a lot more positive days than negative. I would say the 3 week mark was when I truly started to feel like myself. 

Some changes I've seen:
-my toddler seems so much happier around me, and I know it's because I'm smiling and laughing a lot more. 
-I feel motivated again.. I want progress and substance out of life. I want to better myself and my body. I want to be a better husband and dad, and friend. Kratom made me complacent with the bare minimum. 
-I wake up earlier feeling refreshed. I'm on a better sleep schedule and don't crave more sleep upon waking
-the sweat.. I sweat a disgusting amount on k. Inside, outside, cold, hot. Didn't matter. I can go out and not have my shirt soaked now. 
-not nearly as irritable as I was on it, and my anxiety has gone down. 
-I just feel such a relief not revolving my life around this shit. Every day, every 3 hours. Fuck that. 

Can't believe it's been a month. At first it seems impossible to make it through, then the weeks just fly, like anything in life. The first days seem like a distant memory. To those thinking of quitting and those in the process, life goes quick. Get the ball rolling and you'll have a week down before you know it. 

This sub had helped me immensely. I clung to it every day like a lifeline. Then slowly as I got better it switched to coming back to see if I could lend a hand. Thank you all.

Every single day I say “okay today is horrible so tomorrow will be better” but when will that come? I see people say after two weeks they felt totally normal again, which only contributes to my health anxiety thinking “okay then something has to be wrong with me.” The depression is so bad I’m showering maybe once a week. Brushing my teeth when I remember, if I feel like I can get up. And my hair is just a frizzy mess on my head and I don’t even care, even though I’m at work in front of everyone.

Phenibut can be even more dangerous than kratom though, so please try to use gabapentin if you can.

I failed tapers multiple times in the past. What worked this time? I may not ever figure it out. It felt like I was slowly withdrawing from society. Spending more time alone than I used to, even though I am relatively social person. I feel like my emotions have come back; I can tell that I'm laughing more easily, sleeping better, better mood, increased libido, on and on.

2021-10-13 15:06:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/q7i8dg/this_may_help_others_with_quitting/,This may help others with quitting...,"TL;DR: Valerian Root has markedly decreased the CT side effect for me. After daily K for the past 3 years, I've gone 2+ days without.

My apologies if this is a known thing but I wanted to pass on something that's happened to me twice (with the second occurrence still happening). I've taken Kratom every day since September 2018.  I've forgotten doses a few times in that span and, for me, that results in a hellish night of RLS....my brain wants to sleep and my body wants to run a marathon.  It's because of that marked physical response that I 've noted something extremely notable that has happened with Valerian Root.

A few months ago, while taking my regular daily Kratom dose, I went to bed and, as happens some times , but not very frequently , I was having trouble sleeping (unrelated to Kratom).  For decades, when I've had trouble sleeping and don't want that narcotic feeling when waking up, I've turned to Valerian Root.  If you're unfamiliar, it doesn't knock you out....it just acts, for lack of a better term, like ""sleep gravity"".  That said, something I noticed that time was, the next day, before heading to bed, I realized that I hadn't taken a single dose of Kratom....no agitation, no indications, not even a habitual feeling of needing to make a shake or take a capsule happened.

Although it was remarkable...there was enough of a possibility of a correlation/causation relationship that I didn't purposefully try it again to test whether it was happenstance or not.  Fast-forward to two nights ago when I was having trouble sleeping again. During that day, I had taken my normal daily dose of Kratom.  At bed, I took 6 x 450mg capsules of Valerian Root (FWIW I'm 255 lbs) at around 10pm.  Towards the evening of the next day, I realized that I hadn't taken any Kratom yet...then I remembered the previous time I took Valerian Root.  Wanting to see how things went, when I went to bed, I laid down and was only minorly restless....almost imperceptible, not even close to what I would normally experience but enough to possibly get in the way of sleep.  After about an hour, I was sure of it...it was minor but not going away.  I got out of bed and took 1/3 of my daily dose of Kratom, went back to bed and slept through the night.

That was last night.  This morning, as I type this, I've yet to take any Kratom.  The timeline might be a bit hard to follow above (apologies), but here's the summary...

* Day 1: 6pm - finally daily shake (2/3 of daily dose)
* Day 1: 10pm - 2,700 mg Valerian Root (again, I am 255 lbs)
* Day 2: \[+0h] 11pm - 1/3 of daily dose
* Day 3: \[+15h] 2pm - none of my normal withdrawal/missed-dose jitters/agitation

Essentially, in 4 more hours, it will be 2 full days I've gone and having only taken 2/3 of my daily dose...and that feels like it was even a judgement call since the RLs was so minor.

I'm going to see how long this lasts.  Not drawing any conclusions from it but judging by the hellish RLS and agitation I feel when I don't get enough Kratom, I felt like it was worth posting my experience.

This is all very noteworthy for me, personally, as I have a surgical procedure coming up in November that I really want to be clean for so as to not muddy the waters or have anything extra coursing through my system when I go under.  Personal preference....I understand there are others.  I'm a developer by trade, not a biologist or chemist.  Maybe someone out there knows what characteristics Kratom might share with Valerian Root.  All I know is I've taken the least amount of Kratom I've ever taken in 3 years and might be onto something that will help me (and others) quit.

If there are others with similar experiences with Valerian Root, I'd love to hear them.

Best of luck to everyone.  
\*UPDATE\* (changed times to be relative to last dose)

* Day 3: \[+19h] 6pm - no withdrawal/missed-dose jitters/agitation as of yet
* Day 3: \[+23.5h] 10:30pm - will likely head to bed in about an hour. Planning on taking Valerian Root then as I'm guessing it's well out of my system.  Very natural herb and have never had side effects so I think it's worth the try.  I've never gone (even close to) this long without Kratom and not experienced agitation/jitters (saving the previous Valerian Root occasion)
* Day 4: \[+26h] 1:00am - heading to bed
* Day 4: \[+26.5h] 1:30am - took 4x450 mg Valerian Root
* Day 4: \[+32.5h] 7:30am - up to help wife get kids off to school. Slept fine last night. No RLS at all. It’s been a little over 30 hours since I’ve taken any Kratom.
* Day 4: \[+32.5h] 7:30am - kids/wife off to school/work. Overnight 3d print finished so got side-tracked instead of heading back to bed. Sitting at desk...rocking legs a bit but, then again, I do that frequently.  Thinking about how tasty my normal mocha protein + Kratom + PB Fit + liquid stevia would taste but I know that's just craving.  Might fix one without Kratom but add my morning cold brew to scratch that itch.
* Day 4: \[+50h] 11:00pm - No kratom. No agitation. No craving.

I can't explain it but as I've only experienced this twice (i.e. forgetting to take Kratom on the day following a night that I took Valerian Root), in the past 3 years of taking Kratom, although not technically scientific, I'm personally convinced that Valerian Root may have something to offer the cold turkey method.

Why do the majority of people on here swear and emphasize on EXERCISE to help with the healing process? That is because depression, anxiety, and stress are all forms of energy. Now there is positive and negative forms of energy. You need to use that negative form of energy and transfer it into something positive like exercise. If you do not transfer that negative energy it will consume you and cause you to relapse. You must train your mind to be more powerful than your emotions. 

While laying in bed, your mind says “we need to get up and do this” and your emotions say “but I don’t feel like it” this is a critical point. You must learn to be aware of when this happens and get your ass up to transfer that negative energy into motivation, strength and power. Remember you are the only person who stands in your way. If you are not able to control yourself you will never be able to take control of anything else in life. 

Training the mind is like training the muscles, the results take time. Training your mind for a few days and expecting results is like going to the gym for 1 week and expecting to be in shape. Discipline is what majority of us lack. Discipline is key to being in control. Train your mind, transfer your energy, stay clean and motivated even when you are not. Fake it till you make it!

I look at this subreddit literally every single day bc I want to quit so bad. I am an addict - I was heavily addicted to opiates for years. I got into some legal trouble which put me in treatment court last year which forced me to get clean. I was clean off everything for about 3 months then got into Kratom. My use has skyrocketed and now I'm at 50-60 gpd. I've been using daily for about 10 months now. 

Last week I tried quitting cold turkey I was so done with spending $ on Kratom and feeling dependent on a substance. I was shocked at how bad the physical withdrawals were. For me they were much worse than opiate withdrawals. I wanted to crawl out of my own skin and not sleeping was horrible. I made it like 30 hours and caved. 

I'm thinking about starting a taper but am torn bc that means I'll have to go pick some more up today and I hate it so much I just don't even want to put myself in that position of being in the smoke shop lol but then im scared to start withdrawaling so bad that I just go and pick it up anyway.

I was cleaning the other day and found 7 clonezepams (who knows how old they are and why the fuck I have them lol). Which I held onto because they would really help in Kratom withdrawal. But then I remembered I'm in drug court until January and get drug tested twice a week (urine and oral). I don't want to risk taking any substance. 

I think my best bet would be to taper but I am an addict so I have little self control. This sucks so bad I wish I could just get through the first few days.

i can assure you that i did not feel strong at all when i was trying to quit. i couldn't make it 1 day kratom-free no matter how many times i told myself ""i won't take kratom tomorrow."" my problem with alcohol was the reason i wanted to try kratom in the first place, but it was actually much harder for me to give up kratom. i never drank every day but i wanted to take kratom all day, every day.

you do not have to feel strong on day 1...you probably will still feel like a sad sack of garbage on day 7. but i will tell you this, if you stick with it and trust the process, you WILL feel strong on day 14. on day 30. on day 100! **you don't feel strong when you begin, but you feel strong afterwards.**

i think a lot of us, including myself, want to wait for the ""right time"" to quit. *what about work? what about my responsibilities at home?* some of us have partners and kids and we don't want them to see us suffer. i have my freaking WEDDING in 3 weeks and i couldn't have decided to quit at a worse time. i was contemplating calling off the wedding because my social anxiety is through the roof and the last thing i want is all eyes on me. 

then day 13 came, and i feel like i'm looking at life through a new pair of eyes. i actually feel ready to conquer my wedding day and whatever life throws at me. because i made the decision to do what's best for me even though i felt weak and hopeless at first, that gave me new confidence. i realized that i can do hard things and ride out uncomfortable emotions on my own. and so can you, we all can.",25,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44947684}"

I hope my advice can help.,"Clean for 3 months from K (12g/day, taper to 4, then CT). I read about a lot of folks struggling and I was one of you 3 months ago. You can quit this goo. The mental struggle is 10 fold worse than the physical. 

If you can meditate, even 5 mins a day, do it. This will only help you with the mental struggle. If you remember nothing else from this post remember this, change is the only constant in the universe. 

One minute K is not on your mind and the next it is. And you start stressing that it will break you down and you will have to dose to feel better. This is the crucial moment as your stress and worry and focus on that feeling, that it will spiral into having to dose. You think the solution is to push it away or not think about it, or worse, to give in. 

In my experience this will not help. The solution is simple. Take a moment, feel the feeling, accept it as a normal part of recovery. **Accept it and know it is temporary**. In a short time it will go away. I promise you it will go away. But I also promise you it will come back. And each time just acknowledge it. It is not an enemy but a friend. A friend reminding you that your body is healing. 

Don’t get mad at yourself, your body or thinking. You did this, you quit and now your body wants to heal and this is how it does it. 

TL;DR - Change is the only constant. You feel the cravings and want to dose, don’t push it away. Accept it and know it’s temporary. It will go away but it will come back. Accept it and know it’s temporary. Rinse and repeat. You can do this.",51,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5421525}"

I am currently going through a slow taper from Kratom.  I had been using it to help with anxiety for 2 years but now I feel it makes it severely worse.

I imagine they will give me an SSRI or something similar, doubt they would give me a benzo to start (and I honestly don’t really want to fuck with them). 

Does anyone have experience with anxiety meds and kratom?  Could there potentially be some brain chemistry implications from taking them together while I taper?  I am at 7.5 gpd and knocking off .1-.2 g per day.  Should I tell the doc about the kratom or would that spook them?

Been training both bjj and MT on the same day about 3-4 days a week and found the kratom starts to hold me back, which is good because I value my progress more than the drug. I’m competitive, so I think this may—and I stress “may”—be my ticket to seeing this through.

Also been taking 1000 mg of Agmatine every day for a month, which seems to not only lower my tolerance, but blunt any extra euphoria I would have been chasing before. Maybe it’s all in my head.

At any rate, sorry for the novel, but does anyone have any thoughts when a good time to jump would be? I know it’s individual, but I’ve been able to maintain a pretty decent level of performance (for me at least) at work, parenting and martial arts training, and worry if I jump too early I will end up losing motivation to continue giving it my all at my daily responsibilities—kind of a weird double-edged sword, which could contribute to my weak brain making me relapse.

(30-50 gpd),"if you're reading this and KNOW you have to jump off the crazy train at some point...do it sooner than later. do it before it gets any worse, because the withdrawals will just get more unbearable the longer you prolong your usage.

i'm 15 days CT and i can almost say that i feel like a million bucks again. i think prolonging my daily use any longer would have made this quitting process so much harder. tapering down to 5-10 gpd for a few weeks before jumping off made my physical withdrawal symptoms basically nonexistent...it was mostly VERY emotionally and mentally taxing.

i have anxiety, depression, and issues with alcohol so because of that, kratom was my ""saving grace"" for a short while...until it wasn't. i was actually more dependent on kratom than i ever was with alcohol. i was never much of a daily drinker, because i wouldn't be able to function. with kratom, you're able to do it daily (in the beginning) without many consequences. however, as we know, that does not last.

for anybody who needs to hear this, because lord knows i needed to hear it, KEEP GOING. i am absolutely shocked about how i woke up on day 13 feeling like i could conquer the world, clean my whole house top to bottom, go on a run, and get through the day without crying. before day 13, i felt borderline suicidal. this shit FUCKS with your brain, especially if you already have mental health issues. but your brain is resilient. it is not broken. everybody is different based on their usage and their recovery process but it WILL get better. you will feel even better than you did before you were a slave to the green sludge. most importantly, you will be proud of yourself for making it through hell and loving yourself enough to kick a self-sabotaging addiction.

my biggest tips:

1. 20 min. hot epsom salt bath before bed for RLS/sleep/anxiety relief
2. roll-on biofreeze or icy hot (infused with CBD is a plus) right before bed to help with RLS
3. prioritize gut health (probiotics, apple cider vinegar, leafy greens, black seed oil, etc.)
4. light exercise (daily walks in the sun, yoga, etc.) in the beginning until you feel comfortable running and doing cardio
5. guided meditation and breath work youtube videos (even 10-15 mins. is beneficial)
6. allowing yourself to unapologetically rest and be a lazy garbage slug if need be
7. watch feel-good movies and shows, play video games, read motivational/self-help books
8. drink A LOT of water

2021-10-12 11:15:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/q6of9t/36_days_clean/,36 Days Clean,"Good morning quitters. Today is 36 days completely off kratom. Here are a few things I’ve noticed since quitting. First of all-I was taking a pretty low dose of ~8 grams a day 7 days a week…for about 5 years. I’m 31 M with formerly thick nice hair. The reason I quit was because A my hair looks like dogshit, and I think has to do with kratom. Could be stress as well (I went through some nasty relationship issues in 2019 and have only really gotten over them now) and B-I couldn’t feel the kratom anymore, like at all. So I figured I’d quit while I can instead of doubling down. 

My hair looks about the same as it did 36 days ago-I got really thin and weird hair in the front hairline area, as well as the top minus a few strands of longer nice hair. The back and sides are thick as hell. So essentially it looks like I have a combover right now. I’m praying this is from the kratom and will fix itself in time. I do see some baby hairs popping up on the hairline so that’s promising I guess. 

For about one week (last week) my scalp was very very itchy and flaky. When I scratched it, little sandy like chunks of crap came out. Not dandruff (had that as a kid) this was something else entirely. 

The first 2 weeks were the worst. I was a total emotional mess. Moods swinging around harder than a wrecking ball. Emotionally now I feel mostly normal if not slightly dull. I’ve been fortunate to not have too many cravings at all. I attribute that to really truly wanting to be off this junk. I’ve read and re-read many many posts about hair and repair time. Can anybody show me some love or encouragement concerning the hair timeline? Specifically those who have been quit for a while. What was the hair repair like for you?

2021-10-12 09:58:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/q6ms11/my_little_story/,My little story,"I've been hanging out here now for a few weeks, and I've read just about every word that's been written. Figured it was time to write a few of my own besides my occasional comments of encouragement.

Had about a 50-60gpd habit built up over several years (roughly 4-5), then switched to a powdered extract for the last 2 years, which bumped me up to the equivalent of at least 70-80 gpd. So I'm at least 6 years in, probably more, with a pretty heavy habit. I started using it because my back was seriously jacked up and I didn't want to have surgery ""until the risk of not doing it was greater than that of doing it."" Which it was, as I could no longer feel my legs after standing up for a few minutes. Prior to switching to kratom, I had been on the prescription opioid ride for a few years, thanks to a generous/ignorant physician, and quit ct because I couldn't keep going unless I was willing to switch to heroin. I just couldn't get enough. But I noticed that not only did the k help with pain, it leveled me out emotionally for the first time in my life. I have multiple mental health diagnoses, was always told I was too sensitive, unable to handle normal life swings, and have major depressive disorder with a few suicide attempts under my belt. It felt like a good justification for continuing to use this oh-so-natural herb that couldn't be bad, since it's totally legal. Ha.

Over the years, my home has completely fallen apart, I have zero ability to retain memories, and I feel like I've been mostly asleep at the wheel. You know the deal. The pandemic, and my ability to work from home, made things worse as well as made me realize what it was doing to me. Once I could return to my office, I couldn't make myself do it. I can barely leave my bed, let alone my house. I just have zero fucks to give. I've pushed myself to keep my kids happy, but this is NOT the mother I want to be. I realized I was running out of time in just about every possible way.

I was lucky enough to meet my soul mate about a year and a half ago, though how he is so easy going about my utter lack of motivation and passion is beyond me. At some point, I confessed that I was addicted to this herb, and tried to explain it to him. He seemed unfazed, which made me think maybe I hadn't been as honest as possible. I did everything I could to hide the extent of my usage from everyone, even my best friend. 

About a month ago, something finally clicked, and I started looking hard at things and decided it was time to quit. Said best friend around the same time admitted she's an alcoholic and decided to quit, so it felt like it was time to try some radical honesty. For almost 4 weeks now I've been tapering. I started with a plan based on the guide in this sub, but have actually dropped much faster than planned. Sometimes it seems easy, sometimes impossibly hard. I've been in low-grade wd pretty much the whole time, and have only slept more than 2-3 hours in a night one time (and that was thanks to the Wim Hof cold water thing, which OMG DO IT! I got to swim laps in an unheated pool of 60 degrees before bed and I swear there's nothing like it. Even cold showers and baths weren't as good, since I got the double whammy of a workout AND the cold. Now I'm thinking I'll have to find a creek deep enough for swimming but not so high I'll drown while swimming in the dark before bed so I can replicate the process lol. Alternative suggestions welcome!!).

I'm taking most of the supplements listed here that have evidence to back them up, and I don't know if they're really helping or if it's the act of taking SOMETHING, like the addict in me wants to do, that helps. Either way, I'm good with it. But the thing that's helped most is just reading your stories. Reading about how there's light at the end of this fucking tunnel of horrors, about your courage in facing your inner demons, about how, despite the variety of experiences, symptoms, and reasons, we are all so very much alike. It makes me feel a little less alone, and a little less scared. 

So. Tl;dr? THANK YOU. Thank you all for sharing such personal stories and struggles. Every one of you brings something of value to the table here, and I am beyond grateful for those who are months or even years into their recovery but still come here to support those of us who are just beginning our journeys.

3 failed quits since August (22hrs / 34hrs / 29hrs) and now considering detox or rehab. Never done either but it seems like it might be the only way to get out from under this. I've been a user since 2018 and have been in the 50-60gpd range this most recent stint (10 mos). I quit in 2020 from a higher dose (more like 100-120gpd) ct/no meds, but this time I can barely make it past night one. The first night of RLS just makes the anxiety skyrocket. I can't accept that I won't be sleeping tonight and I need to distract myself or walk or shower or stretch. Get totally stuck in my head thinking of the many nights to come. Nights 2 and 3 and 4 - which will probably be worse. Just a total psych-out everytime. 

Trying to wrap my head around rehab. Wife and family are pushing me in that direction. I can picture doing a 5 day detox thing, but a whole month? Medical leave from work under mysterious circumstances. I’m just supposed to tell the boss and coworkers that it’s none of their business? I guess. Detox gets you over the acutes hump and then dumps you back onto the street shaky and still not sleeping thru the night. I suppose 30 days is the smarter move. If insurance will cover a decent portion of it. I’m obviously having trouble with the idea. (Might try one more ct)

Feels great to be free. I’ve read everyone’s stories here through the whole process, which has helped immensely. I finally made an account so I can post my own stories and comment on others’. 

So almost a week ago I caught a bad cold, probably from the back-to-school germs that float around this time of year. Confirmed not covid, just an annoying persistent cold. During these last 3 months I’ve had absolutely zero cravings for the stupid plant we all got addicted to, minus a few passing thoughts during acutes of “if I just took a little, I’d have relief” but no actual desire for the effects. Today what I’ve been struggling with is remembering that during my kratom use, I almost never got sick, and if I did get a cold, it would last 24-36 hours max. 

I still have no desire for any buzz I might get. But I really do miss the superhuman ability to fight off colds/not catch them in the first place. My brain is trained to no longer even see kratom as an option, so there’s no chance of relapse. It’s just an annoying thought in the back of my mind. Probably the last of the addictive demon trying to convince me that “just a little wouldn’t hurt,” which we all know is BS! I’ll stay strong, and I hope you all stay strong today too. 

If anyone else is struggling with this same thought process, just remember that even if you could consider kratom a “cold medicine,” the laundry list of side effects isn’t worth it. Better to just deal with the temporary sickness than get sucked into the same old addiction that only ever took and never gave. Addiction never gives higher highs, just lower lows.",5,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5751904}"

I recently quit for the last time, started tapering down from 25g per day for ~8 months habit down to 6g per day in ~3 weeks and jumped off. I've been kratom free for 17 days now YAY!

However , I've still developed PAWS I think. Mild daytime depression and general feelings of ""meh"" followed by a slight lack of focus. Insomnia from hell on some nights, other nights I sleep ""okay"". The depression comes in waves and other times I'm ok. I find socializing helps as does exercise. Mostly, the depression strikes when I am ALONE.

I've also suddenly gotten this urge to find sober friends lol. All through my life, my friends have centered around us all getting fucked up, and I'm done with that life now.

I almost went on SSRI's during my taper , which was pure hell, but I got past it and decided against.

My question is: for those maybe with a similar intake as me or at the point in PAWS where I am, how long or how much longer should I expect the torture to last?

Also, any tips on making sober friends? Maybe an AA program? I dunno. It's a little alien to me I've always been a tough guy loner type unless I was getting drunk at the bar.

RLS is completely gone, i get about 6-7 hrs of sleep per night now, which if you would of asked me a week ago, i would of thought it was impossible. If your thinking about quitting,  do it! The first 4 days are the worst, but it gets noticeably better each day after! The feeling of no longer being a slave to this poison, and always waiting for that next dose, is such a freaking relief!

-Exercise…been said a million times but its the truth.  Throw some headphones on, find some positive, uplifting music(feel free to hit me up for some recommendations!) and go walk/run/bike in the sun.  It will give you strength.
-Music.  When that music hits you, embrace it.  I had moments yesterday just driving/walking around where music gave me goosebumps and made me feel alive.  I wish i could live in that moment forever!
-No alcohol.  I took a hard look at my relationship with alcohol a few weeks before I quit and have been staying away from it.   I was more or less a nightly drinker before that, not a lot, but a few.  Im not saying i will abstain forever, i do enjoy the social aspect, but its time for me to put it down for a while.
-Supplements.  Thought i had tried em all the last couple of quits!  This time im taking l-theanine, a mood booster with st.johns wort, an adrenal support, and a testosterone booster.  Magnesium and valerian root to sleep.

Well it’s been 2 weeks now CT and to be honest I’ve never felt better! It’s been a hell of a journey. Key point: even after 2 weeks you have ups and downs. Some days are great some are boring. Some days you have energy and motivation, other days you just want to be left alone. RLS completely gone. Sleeping much better! Waking up more energetic, rather than half dead like when on K. Stomach still recovering. Much better now tho! No more bloating, I can finally lay a fart without any problem. Idk maybe I’m the only one who had gas release problems on K. Anyway, continuing on. Cravings are completely gone, don’t even think of that nasty shit. Over all by week 2 it gets muchhhhhh better. But it’s an ongoing process. I see posts of people on like day 70CT who relapse. You must never forget why you quit. 99% of the stories I have read where the person said “one day won’t hurt” always ended in a completely relapse and back to daily use. Thank you to these brave people for sharing their stories, I use them as a reminder to never fall for that “one time” BS mind fuck game your brain pulls on you. As majority of people here state, exercise is EVERYTHING. You have to be active, even when you don’t want to! Keeping busy keeps the mind refreshed.  Honestly The best feeling is not shoving pills or that nasty powder down my throat every few hours, not thinking of the next dose, not having pockets full of pills when leaving the house. Not worrying about not having the next dose. I was one of the people who was lurking on these posts of people who CT 7 days and I was like Wow, how is that possible. Look at me now baby! I will try to continue to post my journey for other lurkers who want to quit but think it’s impossible. Posts such as these really helped me, so I will pass it on in hopes that my post will motivate one of you. God bless! Side note: Wim Hoff breathing exercises helped me A LOT! check em out. Love you guys! Keep going! Trust the process. Remember wars are not won by the fearless they are one by the feared. When you fear something enough you will defeat it!

2021-10-11 10:52:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/q5xkpu/bumpy_road/,Bumpy road,"Hey all. I just wanted to share my story. I’m a 45-year-old former crackhead. I also have all my  adult children, grand children and my girlfriend and her child living with me. I have paid all the bills and the mortgage by myself so they can get on their feet.I got my life together about 8 years ago and got a really good paying job. I worked 60 to 65 hours a week and did a lot of heavy lifting. I ended up hurting my back. I thought it was just a pulled muscle or something that wasn’t too serious. I ended up switching jobs. The pain got worse so I started using K. It worked great for pain. I started using it after work to unwind as well because I enjoyed the high. My job constantly drug tests but not for K. It was a match made in heaven or so I thought. In a year I went from 4gm twice a day to 12gm 4x a day. 

I had another new job lined up so I quit my old one and was going to take a month off to get myself together. I love all the people in my house but they are lazy slobs. All the kids got sent home from school because they had lice. This happened like three times. I ended up treating their hair and combing it out as well as cleaning their rooms and bedding to get rid of it while they’re parents watched Netflix. We have roaches now because they leave food everywhere and don’t clean up after themselves. So one night I got really drunk like an idiot and told everyone exactly how I felt about what is going on. In the process of that I also punched holes in the walls and smashed my head through the front door window. 

For the next few days I thought about how stupidly I acted. I was really embarrassed about what I did. I decided that I wasn’t going to drink anymore and I was going to quit Kratom. The first half of the day wasn’t bad. I had an 8 ounce bag that was almost full that I flushed down the toilet.Later my nose started running and my back and hips started aching. The next thing I know around 5pm I’m crying uncontrollably. All I felt was despair and hopelessness. I cried for five hours straight. I thought I was losing my mind. I didn’t know that was part of the withdrawals. Then the restlessness started. It was about 11pm. I tossed and turned for hours. I got on my phone and started researching. This when I realized that I was in withdrawals. I was having thoughts of suicide and wished I could jump out of my own skin. It was a living hell. It was around 3 AM and all the places that sell K were closed. I didn’t know how I was going to make it to the morning so I could buy more. I then remembered that I had empty kratom bags in the trash can in my bathroom and in my closet. I proceeded to pick the bags out of the garbage and filled them with some water and shook them around to get any residue out of them. I did this three times in a row. I felt so low and pathetic. It actually helped with the restlessness. I was at the gas station that sells K at 7 AM when they unlocked the door. I really didn’t think I was going to make it to the morning. I now realize I have a huge problem. I always thought I was a strong person but I could not take feeling like that. All you guys that are able to quit cold turkey are amazingly strong people. I have nothing but admiration and respect for you. I am starting my taper today. I really hope I can stick to it. Sending love to everyone else who is going through this.

I’m a long time lurker of this sub, first time poster. I didn’t want to post until I got past at least 48 hours. I’ve gone 24 hours plenty of times and have not been able to stand the second round of insomnia coupled w the even more intense physical sensations of RLS, skin crawling and my usually well managed OCD kicking into high gear on day 2. 

Context: This past stint of daily k use has been 2.5 years, approx 20-40 gpd. The first time I tried k was 2019, a friend gave some of theirs to try, I loved it. I’ve casually used opiates here and there for years, and here was a “natural” accessible way to access that feeling. How fortunate! I order a sample pack online and they sent me way more than I ordered (accidentally?). Without knowing better I quickly started using daily and on a day I didn’t “feel” like kratom, that night I woke up to this unusual feeling that I couldn’t get comfortable in any position (RLS). It occurred to me kratom might have had something to do with what I was feeling, and I vowed to quit ASAP. Being dependent on anything is unacceptable to me. I had only been using for maybe 5 months at that time, did a taper for a month and jumped one night making it through w CBD and will power. Flash forward to the start of the pandemic, I’m finishing an intense web dev bootcamp while going through a deviating breakup at the same time and I don’t have time to feel sad. At all. Kratom made it possible for me to focus on my projects and just push forward. Before all that I had been using kratom sparingly, keeping withdrawal at bay. I was so broken emotionally I knew what would happen if I didn’t let up on k but honestly, I didn’t care. I thought to myself, I am going through something and I need k to get through this hard time, I’ll deal with the consequences later. I mean I quit before, and I was hard but I did it, I can do it again when I’m ready. Well when the time came where I was sufficiently disgusted with kratom I decided to quit again but I was not prepared for how much harder it would be that time. I went maybe 30 hours CT before caving after hours of pulling my hair praying for release of the just intense intense physical withdrawals and my OCD becoming unmanageable. I would then try and taper but end up giving up, on and on, as one year past, then two. 

Present quit: I had been tapering (again) for a few weeks, trying to go longer and longer without. Cut out 2 full doses, using only to manage w/d (trying to avoid feeling high). Then one day I didn’t take my morning dose and went all day without. I thought this might be it but caved at 4:30 am and took just enough for withdrawals to subside and to sleep. The next day I was determined to do it no matter what. I bought a bunch of supplements (vit C, magnesium, 5htp) and advil. That night was so so rough, I reserved myself to the fact I wouldn’t be sleeping and watched Kill Bill 1 and 2 as well as the office and grit my teeth through it. By the morning I felt like absolute crap but I was so proud. And I didn’t turn back. The second night CT was also hell with no sleep and RLS but I made it this time, past 48 hours. And now it’s easing up bit by bit every hour. Nights still suck, but last night I actually slept a few hours so I have hope again this could be it. 

The lesson: Like many of you reading the posts here, lurking, a part of me thought I couldn’t do it. Even though I was tapering intending to quit, I also doubted I could really do it. But here I am and you can be here too. You deserve to have yourself back, to be free. Find what works for you. I was able to exercise I bit (yoga for 1 hour on day one) but I couldn’t really bring myself to much. Lots of ppl on here report it helps them and not being able to made me feel a bit weak. But it’s okay if you can’t. Find what you can do. Music has been absolutely crucial for me. Gives me the natural endorphins and the fact it sounds so good off k reminds me of how much k steals from you. It steals the  ability to connect. Yes I got to be the robot on k I thought I needed to be when my relationship fell apart while I had strict deadlines to meet, but I lost so much more then I gained. The ability to connect with myself and others, to music. Not to mention everything in your life revolving around kratom dosing, from eating to sleeping to travel and beyond. 

So if your thinking about quitting DO IT. Embrace connecting again, you’ll gain so much more then a life lived on kratom’s terms.",17,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4466103}"

I am once again starting the journey of trying to quit and get my life back.  I found this sub and I really hope it can help me stick with my plan for good.  I have pretty much destroyed my life over the last two years with kratom.  I have become a lonely recluse who is failing out of college, and I barely eat or sleep.  I've always been really depressed (diagnosed with major depressive disorder), but I used to do well in college and I had a lot of friends. I have become a loser who takes kratom and sits at my laptop all day playing games that I'm not even enjoying.  The kratom has honestly made me not give a shit about anything, but deep down I'm absolutely terrified.  I'm sorry for the rant, I guess I just needed somewhere to admit how much of a problem I have.  I am attempting to quit cold turkey, and I even gave my roomate the keys to my car and told her to hide them so I won't be able to go to a smoke shop.  I know the next week is going to be absolute hell but I know I need to do this.  I want my life back.  If anyone has any tips that can help me over the next few days I would be grateful. Thanks to anyone that actually took the time to read this!

Officially 1 week since cold turkey.

I got a lot to complain about; about sleep, restlessness, ennui, being a little lost finding who I am in this sober world. I'm frustrated with myself and the way I manage my life. I have hope to become better, but fear that I cant. I have people who love me, but don't know how to love myself. Shit is hard, man. But you know what? Its fine. I feel fine. I got 7 hours of sleep last night. I got some chores done. I talked to friends. I've been laughing and smiling, by myself even, just enjoying something I read or seeing something pretty. 

But my biggest accomplishment of the day was when I was driving to the store, feeling a little uncomfortable, a little depressed, hearing that voice in my head that says ""you could take a pill right now and you wouldnt feel like this any more. They make pills that change your mood, you know? Eat a pill, idiot. Feel the happy chemicals."" And instead of angrily pushing the voice out of my head, turning up the music, trying not to hear it - for the first time in a while I heard it out, and honestly disagreed with it. I feel this type of angst and unwellness im experiencing sober on kratom too, on xanax, on whatever. I'm always sad, or lonely, I got shit I need to work on. The drugs dont solve anything, they dont make you feel better, they make you feel in control. The illusion of controlling my state of mind when im feeling something I dont want to feel is the addiction within the addiction. Kratom doesnt fix your mood, it helps you hide from it, keeps you from acknowledging things that need to be done, and arrests your emotional development.

Thats my take on dealing with craving. Craving isnt logical, its an animal instinct of self preservation we've developed through self medicating. Logic says: I was horribly sad, it was a demeaning and difficult chunk of my life maintaining this habit for years, and my break up with the drug was an atrocious muti-day/week/month emotional process. There is no way in hell I would sign up for that again. - But the craving romanticizes it in your memory and says: You had so much fun though, remember what it was like feeling that good in the beginning? You could do that bit over again, and just not do the shit where you let it get out of control. - And you know what, I guess it was fun for a while, but that ""fun"" was an avoidance tactic my subconscious used to cleverly keep me from working on real solutions, and it painted a deceiving picture of perpetual escapism as a valid coping mechanism for depression, boredom, and introversion. 

Im trying to do better to recognize the craving as a lie. Maybe even give it some personification like he's a creepy, old-timey, Louisiana pimp with a gold tooth that says that hes going to treat me real nice, give me a warm home where i can eat off fine charcuterie boards every night; classy ones with fine prosciutto, cheeses that stink, and olives that dont. He's gonna cover me in gold jewelry and then I'll be the queen of Baton Rouge. - And from that point my logic has a little more ground to stand on, because we've seen this movie before, and this character is a recognizable villain. Now logic can more forcefully say ""Youre not gonna gonna eat cheese and be the queen of Baton Rouge, you big dumb bitch. That guys gonna fuck you.""

This is all theory and talking out loud though. Im just an addict trying to find a new angle on staying sober, I dont know shit. I could tout this dont-talk-to-the-naughty-pimp method of abstinence like its a psychological battle axe against the evil horde of dependency, but you could also catch me two months from now, arm-in-arm with the pimp like ""He's different now, and we're getting marrriiiiieeeeeed!""

I'm gonna try real hard not to do that though.

I just want to find happiness on my own. Im only a week done with the shit, but I see some hope for that, and that feels good in a way that being high doesnt.

Here's how it's going","This'll prob be my last post until things change significantly or until a milestone. I used 50-60gpd for 18 months 

So I feel really phenomenal except that I can tell I have a certain heightened baseline anxiety about facing the world again and living life bc I've got some catching up to do. This is dealt with and doesn't bother me as long as I go cycling every other day at least. Trying to stay away from THC as much as possible, for the past 3 days I've only smoked a bit of delta 8 just before bed to assist with sleep. No longer need any magnesium to sleep and don't deal with any RLS at night. 

The thing that hinders me the most during the day is the fact that after being awake for 2 hours or so the heaviness sets in, I feel like I'm made of lead and it's so hard to move a muscle. I don't feel this tiredness at all when I do real exercise like cycling or hiking but as soon as I'm just doing regular stuff or anything that's not intentional cardio then I feel so heavy and weak. It's almost easier to ride my bike 20 miles then it is to move the bicycle from the bed of the truck to the ground. During the day, trying to do stuff is difficult because of this as I want to collapse and just lay there the entire day. 

Hoping this begins to go away soon. Other than that, this recovery is going great. I've been healing emotionally and I can feel my testosterone coming back in good and bad ways. I just gotta learn to live with testosterone again, which I'm looking forward to because it's a very important part of a man's functioning.  

Idk if I'm tripping or not but I've been using biotin shampoo and eating super healthy and exercising and getting tons of sun and my hair is actually starting to look thicker and healthier, it's still thinned bc of kratom but my skin and hair looks so much better than they have in a year.",7,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5054236}"

i have had a ROUGH couple weeks mentally and emotionally. i gave myself full permission to be a lazy garbage slug, but frankly that’s the best i could do. i laid in bed a lot, cried A LOT, ordered a bunch of junk food delivery to my door because i didn’t have motivation to cook, put all of my household chores on the back burner…i was basically useless. but today, i woke up and felt like my zest for life was back. 

this morning, i got some tasks done that i’ve been putting off and got up and went for a RUN. i just felt like putting on my shoes and blasting music and being in the sun. i actually have motivation to clean my house which is what i’m doing right now. i opened up all the windows to bring some light and fresh air in, and am starting to feel a bit more hopeful.

over the weekend, i had no other choice but to find NATURAL, sober ways to feel good. watching feel-good movies, listening to music, running, drinking water, playing video games, etc. i’ve been depending on kratom for so long to make me happy and forgot that there are other ways that aren’t going to make me hate myself. i think that’s what this journey is trying to teach us…we need to re-connect with ourselves and find out what makes us truly happy.",19,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.77206326}"

Am I still experiencing withdrawals?,"Sorry for a long post, but I feel like I need to describe exactly what I feel to get some constructive feedback. I just want someone to tell me whether this is something to be expected from kratom withdrawals or maybe I'm dealing with some other problem now.

I've started taking kratom irregularly a few months ago. It felt like it helped me a lot with my anxiety and I was able to use it relatively moderately - at most 10gpd a few times a week with breaks for a week or so. I had some important deadlines in September and the closer they got, the more often I took it (still the same ammounts, but almost every day now) and at some point I've experienced something I thought to be some mild withdrawals - this strange tension in my stomach that makes me feel very uncomfortable and restless and feels similar to how anxiety manifests itself physically. This feeling was very unpredictable and I couldn't tell for sure if those were actually withdrawals. There wasn't a clear correlation between not taking a dose and feeling this thing, but usually it was pretty obvious that when taken even a very small dose (0.5g) during this feeling, it would go away after 20 minutes or so instead of lasting for hours. I kept taking these small amounts for about a week and then two weeks before the last of my deadlines I started taking larger doses again, every day with no breaks. So that's my relatively short kratom history.

After that I've finally stopped taking it after a very quick taper. I was surprised by how quickly all of my cravings disappeared and up until now, I've never had any urges to take it even though I still have a pack in my drawer. But this physical feeling of tension in my stomach is still there. It goes away quicker now, but it can still last from 30 minutes to about 2 hours. It's the only thing I still feel after the three weeks. I've also had a runny nose and sensitivity to temperature for the first few days, but it's all gone and it wasn't really that bad compared to this weird tension feeling.

Ive gotten a new phone since and didn’t remember my login. Anyways, I was always inspired by people who made it past so many major milestones, so I wanted to come back and do the same. 

My problems didn’t all end, but I’m still not missing being tied to Kratom. The first few weeks were fucking hard. My intensive sweating and crazy shitting did eventually stop. My *real* cravings for Kratom mostly stopped about 8 weeks after my last dose. Occasionally, I’ll think about how nice it’d be to dose, but I’ve not been seriously tempted. I objectively look and feel so much healthier and better. 

I’m making this post specifically today because today is actually a really shitty mood day for me. Some amount of it is my own doing - a consequence of my actions - but with Kratom, I could’ve easily blown through this day, get hyped up over something new, and kicked the grief can down the road even farther. 

My migraines are way better now - much less frequent, and most are less intense. 

Since Kratom numbed me out (except for rage), I do experience all feelings strongly. It’s a lot sometimes. 

But I wouldn’t want to go back. All of what I have now - yes, even on a day where I could barely get out of bed - was worth the early weeks of struggle.

For anxiety, Kava, and a strong CBD oil has been working really well for me. Do your own research on kava, I dont want to start shouting the virtues of a great plan-derived medicine to help your mood on a god damn kratom withdrawal board.

Sleep still crappy, some RLS, and random nausea/GI pain, but aside from rebound joint pain and lack of motivation, I was doing OK. I was working, writing, doing music.

And then, I apparently ate something disagreeable (no idea what), had one glass of white wine with a small dinner, and  holy hell, feels like the first 5 days. Headache, nausea, all of it all over again. Yeesh.

QUESTION: Is it typical for Kratom recovery to be non-linear and that my system is going to have low resilience for a while? Cause I think that's the deal. 
 
I'm in no danger of relapsing fwiw. I'm enjoying being clean, it's like time has extended and I have more time in the day, it's interesting. And kratom always messed with my GI and I found it disgusting generally. So no love lost on the user experience.

The cravings were like nonexistent for 30 days after the jump til now. What the actual fuck.

I have been 100% honest with my husband since quitting, telling him every last trick how I'll probably try to get some and talk him into thinking it's okay, where my stash spots are, all the places I can get some, even joining our bank accounts so he can see if I purchase any, as well as when I'm feeling cravings. The past couple weeks, I've been hiding my cravings and have been close to buying some countless times. I can get cash and tell him it's for a Christmas present that's cash only and stash it somewhere new. I even have been subconsciously avoiding this sub because in the back of my mind it might stand between me and just getting a bag.

About to Quit CT,"Lately I've found that after I wake up and take my morning dose of 8-14gs (eyeball two spoonfuls), that it's hit or miss. At this point I don't really feel much of anything from the Kratom, but if I wake up feeling like shit which happens about 3 days per week (depressed, really tight back muscles, tired, malaise), then the K knocks all of them symptoms away. I never get a buzz though unless I keep dosing every hour or two throughout the day and by around 6-8pm I'm pretty high/fucked up.

Does anyone else wake up with this uneasy feeling/malaise feeling? It'd characterize it as dysphoria, restlessness, low mood, can't get physically comfortable. This manifests after I grab my morning cup of coffee and sit down at my desk on my computer. Sometimes its worse than others, but I just have this feeling of ""can't get physically comfortable"" which will often persist even if the Kratom takes care of my morning back pain/low mood.

I usually take 0.5mg klonopin and feel MUCH better 45 mins to an hour later, although then I pop a caffeine pill because the Klonopin makes me drowsy. Getting up for a walk helps with the tiredness. It's a real pain in the ass, however.

I guess I am just sort of venting, but am also curious if anyone else feels this way in the morning? Its not every single day, but more often than not. Maybe I just need a new desk set up or something.

I used for 8 months or so and he used for probably 6 and we would take multiple scoops daily together just to talk and tidy everything up, he also used it as a preworkout. He would take a scoop, some espresso, and go lift. We both had anywhere from 3-5 teaspoons a day, him maybe more. He use to use tablespoons because of his size because he figured he needed more than me but eventually brought his dose down to mine and realized it worked better that way a couple of months ago. I think he assumed because of his size and health (6’5 230 lbs body builder/bjj competitor, he’s stacked and healthy as a horse) and low time of use and dose size that he wouldn’t have any withdrawals. My first week was hell on earth, he didn’t feel anything. He quit a week after me. So I’m on day 16 and he’s on day 8 or so. But he’s telling me now that suddenly he can’t sleep for more than a couple of hours every night and he feels really weak and kind of anxious.

I’ve recently began to feel bad about my kratom usage and it’s legality in my country is also in question right now. But I have a lot of worries and doubts.

First I’ll introduce myself. I’m a 24 year old college student of law and this will be my final year (hopefully). I have ADHD and has sudden onset of severe OCD last January that landed me in a psychiatric hospital. Fortunately the OCD went away. I started taking Ritalin for the ADHD this summer.

Now my kratom usage: I first used for 3 months and then had to quit when I went to the hospital. Then I started again for two months in Spring and quit CT with the help of benzos. Then i started drinking alcohol often again and did some harder drugs. 1,5 months ago, I started taking kratom again, because it kept me from the other stuff, especially alcohol. I had to pass some exams in that time period, so my usage increased with the stress. I also broke up with my Ex (after 6 month of relationship) during this time, because she cheated on me when I had to study.

Now I take maybe 30GPD, but sometimes even 50. I would like to be clean completely, but honestly it scares me. I’m worried that there will be empty space in my life that I won’t be able to fill. I also worry that I won’t be able to enjoy my hobbies for months or motivate myself to finish the school without kratom. I also use kratom to hide the grief from my breakup. I feel like an extremely weak person, that isn’t able to handle life without the help of substances.

Unfortunately antidepressants have awful effects on me, just make things worse. I’ve tried like 8-9 of them. I don’t even have any benzos to help me quit and I just can’t do cold turkey without them. I get horrible akathisia and anxiety when I try to CT. I woulf probably go crazy if Id try to. I don’t know what to do, I feel trapped 😓",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.83172977}"

I work a warehouse job and I’ve had back problems all my life but I’ve been too lazy and broke to get it properly checked. Im 21 and my back hurts almost everyday, this started when I was 12. I actually would rather say it’s more uncomfortable than painful. I’m assuming I have a mild case of scoliosis or maybe something else. I plan on getting it checked out but like I said I am lazy and have bills to pay and I already have a debt collection on my credit for a medical bill I didn’t know I had. Also I don’t like talking to people. Anyways I was clean for about a week, had pretty nasty withdrawals but I had gotten past the worse of the physical withdrawals then I relapsed. You see I work at Amazon four days a week in a row followed by three off. When I originally had quit I was taking a lot of time off. Then eventually I had to face work again, & it is miserable for me when my back is hurting. So I convinced myself taking one pill would be okay ONLY for work days and pain management. Which of course led to everyday, maybe skipping one day when I’m off if even that. I made a post before i relapsed but abandoned it after because I was ashamed to be taking it again. Then eventually I started to realize. Kratom isn’t even doing anything good for me anymore. Even when I got the high I used to look for I just felt weird. I had more anxiety on it and could barely talk to people. I had been working at Amazon for maybe three months now and didn’t know anyone’s name. Then I remembered back to the moment I came into work before I convinced myself it was okay to relapse. I may have not felt my best as far as energy and my back but I wasn’t scared to speak to people. I felt like my old self again socially. So I quit again and this is day 33. The only reason I even know that is because I downloaded a sobriety clock on my phone. I don’t even keep up with the days anymore because kratom doesn’t consume my every thought. I just don’t like it anymore I realized it wasn’t the solution to my problems. I actually don’t know what the solution to my problems are but quitting kratom was a first step. I’ve done a lot of research and I’m sure you’ve heard people say something along the lines of, you have to figure out why the addiction started. Which is one of the reason I’m posting today.

Before I talk about that I want to tell you about how it’s been physically, after the worst part of physical withdrawals. I’ve noticed I sneeze a lot more. I actually go #2. I was addicted for years so I realized how many things became normal to me that was abnormal. My boyfriend even made comments on how I used to never poop. I used to think  it was normal but after quitting it’s crazy to think how constipated I was. Also I’m not yawning all day anymore. I think I sweat a lot more because I used to never use a fan and now I enjoy the breeze. My back still hurts, I was hoping that was an effect of kratom and my back would magically stop hurting one day but I actually think something is wrong. I wear a brace sometimes but it just sucks, it doesn’t hurt 24/7 but just about everyday, especially when working. Also it is very nice to be able to get up in the morning without taking kratom and laying in bed hours before it kicks in. Quitting kratom wasn’t the solution to all of my problems but it was a start, right now I am going through it mentally. I don’t know if it’s caused by the long term effects of my addiction or if it’s just me. 

Exactly twice during me trying to quit this time, I took kratom. I only took one pill both times and wasn’t impressed. I got high but it just didn’t feel normal anymore. So it’s safe to say right after those two times I didn’t touch it again the day after. Got rid of the stash because I truly don’t feel the need to take it anymore. On top of that the day after I took a pill only ONE single pill I was depressed. My energy was down and I didn’t want to do anything. I was sad for no reason. One of those days following me taking one pill I found a reason to be mad at my boyfriend and I cried myself to sleep listening to rock music. Then I woke up thinking wtf was that about. Considering the depression I received both of the days after I took a single pill, I knew I was done with kratom for good. It wasn’t helping me with anything the high wasn’t even fun, instead even taking kratom for fun was hurting me, unless I was going to start taking it daily again and I don’t want to do that so it wasn’t worth it. When I said I was going through it mentally , I’m not fighting cravings anymore. I swear to you I have no desire for kratom but I am going through it.


I guess I’m now facing the demons that kratom covered up or like I said maybe it’s the long term effects it had on my brain. Either way, I feel like I’m at a dead end. I work at Amazon as a fulfillment associate and I know we can all agree that it isn’t the best job to have but I appreciate it. I mostly appreciate it because I have so many time off opportunities and with my mental health declining it’s been nice to leave when I need to. I just feel that’s not enough. Firstly they have too many unpaid time off options, one is voluntary and the other you can use your own limited balance. That is great for some but for me Since I have no self discipline it’s so hard to have an option to not work. I don’t live with my parents, i have to pay bills. My bills are paid but me taking every option possible to not work has reflected on my bank account but I’d rather not be there. Before working at Amazon, I used to work 70 hour weeks, I used to pick up shifts. Sometimes by choice sometimes not by choice but I had a certain hustle in me. Now that I’m 21 and have an apartment & bills I can’t find that girl anymore. What happened to her ? When I do complete my shift at Amazon I’m bored all day, I’m also diagnosed with ADHD so I need to be stimulated and doing the same thing over and over again just gives me too much of an opportunity to live in my head. The day seems so long and I’m working ten hour shifts , yet at my old job I worked 12 hour shifts but I had more of a meaningful job as a dialysis technician. I had to leave because I wasn’t treated well and I definitely don’t regret leaving. But I am just so sick of going to a 9-5, I’m sick of being broke, sick of coming home with my feet and legs about to fall off accompanied by back pain, and sick of sitting in traffic for 40+ minutes a day. But also when I’m home it’s not like I do anything useful. Being productive is sooooo hard for me. It’s hard for me to do the simplest task like folding laundry or calling my grandma but then it lives in my head and I beat myself up mentally until I do it. I am on medication for ADHD(methylphenidate extended release). I took a month break from it while I had quit kratom. I recently got back on it, I don’t feel attachment to it and it helps. A lot of the time I can’t even tell I’ve taken anything. It helps focus but it’s not a solve all to my life. It’s like I can have all this energy but I’m still mentally tired .I really want changes in my life. I want to be happy  and not struggle mentally. I want to actually WANT to do things like go out, talk to people. I want to eat healthy I want to work out. But considering the fact I struggle so hard to do normal things it seems so far off. I am not overweight but I just wish I could wake up feeling energetic and happy like some other people. I feel that I create my own problems by overthinking. I want to work for myself, everyone wants me to go to nursing school because I love taking care of people but with what money first of all. I had financial aid in the past but I screwed that up and don’t know if I would be eligible again. There is also something so unsettling to me about continuing to work for someone else even if it’s nursing. I am considering it because I don’t know where else I’d get the money to begin working for myself from. I don’t know where this hatred for a 9-5 came from because I used to be at work every moment of the day. Even when I was 16 I would skip school just to work.  I really just want to work for myself I wish I could quit now but things like that don’t happen overnight. I really wish I would’ve invested the money I made while living with my parents to work for myself. My parents are broke too but at least I had a roof over my head for free. Ive always wanted to be an entrepreneur but with the way I’m struggling to do the simplest task I have no idea where I’d start. I work so much harder when I’m passionate about what I’m doing. Im also deeply jealous of people who are able to make money online just by being themselves. But I don’t think I have the personality for that. I don’t  have a lot of friends in real life so I doubt the internet would like me that much haha. But also a reason for that could be because I rarely want to do anything. The most I do is clean up the apartment and drink when I’m free. I just wish I could enjoy my life . I’m feeling so lost right now in my head but I’m aware that my problems are nothing compared to some people’s problems. I just don’t want to feel this way anymore. I have never felt so purposeless and lost in my head. I don’t walk around showing how I feel but I am going through it in my head.

I just wanted to share that to maybe get some opinions on how I am feeling. Also to tell people who just started their journey off kratom , that there may be a mental journey following it just as hard or harder than the withdrawals. I don’t think I’m some type of know all because I’m aware thirty days is nothing and as you can see I’m still going through it but I know When you’re feeling the aftermath it’s easy to pick your addiction back up but just remember it’s not going to help you because the deeper issue will always be there until you solve it .  Right now for me I don’t know what the solution is. But I do know if I were to pick up kratom and take it right now it wouldn’t help and would probably hurt. I am so grateful I put kratom down, it was turning me into a zombie. It’s also saved so much money. I don’t have to worry about people looking at me when I slip down my mask to pop pills haha & who knows maybe you’ll quit kratom and not be a cry baby like me lol. Hope everyone has a good rest of their day, thanks for listening to my mindless rambling, that’s how it sounds in my head as well.

This is really encouraging to me. I thought I was being super weak and giving too much power to the kratom. I was like, how hard could it be to quit wtf is wrong with me? But reading these accounts makes me see it is hard and I'm going through what anyone would. I've been downing about 30g kratom a day for last 6 years. I can't believe how time has gone by. And I am feeling a lot of depression around all the time I spent half-ill on kratom, or grumpy on kratom, or sneaking around chugging kratom behind my girlfriend's back. 
We have been on verge of breaking up, so I finally told her I've been on k for 6 of the 8 years we've been together. She's giving me the chance to pull myself together now and said it makes more sense now, all my moodiness and general feeling she can't trust me.
I looked at it as an alternative to opiates and maybe it is, or can be while getting off opiates (at least kratom won't kill me). But I now see that it is keeping me in the mindset of opiates, very similar to when I used to do them. You get high 1st thing in morning, all day everyday. I mean, wtf, that is a crappy routine to be in, unhappy if it's not there. Gotta let it go. And I'm terrified always I'll get back into opiates, heroin specifically. It brought me to my knees several times in my 20s. I'm 42 now and still don't feel far from it.
Anyway, day 3. I did 2 days of taper, which I don't recommend, it still sucked and I didn't sleep, might as well just quit. It is hard, I have a very active job and I'm just smoking weed and forcing myself to get work done.",23,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6699188}"

i was thinking that writing out a long list of things that make you happy/used to make you happy might help get through the withdrawals to look at, as a reminder of what you’re working towards

even the smallest things.. 
-getting to wake up and have enough energy to walk downstairs to make a coffee and feed your animals without having to wait until the first dose kicks in
-running all your errands without having to cut them short to get home and take kratom asap because everything hurts
-enough energy to start a new hobby 
-make a meal from scratch
-playing with your kids/animals
-rollerblading/riding a bike
-being free of addiction on vacations and having extra money to spend on them now!!
-healthy hair and skin

those are just a few off the top of my head!
i think a really long list of even the tiniest joys in life will be important.. 
and write out the way the lows of this addiction has affected your life as a reminder of why you started this journey, for when it seems like going back to it would be better 

the more you write the longer it takes to read, the more time will go by!!

I am now over 3 months off kratom (I think?) and do not have a thought in the world about it beyond gratitude to be out and compassion for those of us still struggling.

I've been less active here as I tackle the rest of the vices and am now 2 weeks off alcohol, 2 weeks off sugar, and 10 days off weed. 

I wanted to share that I have found quitting kratom provided a motivation and momentum I could apply to these other areas of life. I also find myself more honest and available to others, which has been satisfying after years of otherwise.

Discipline yields discipline. I experienced this a bit like a motor that is building up energy. Hard things become easy, and new hard things appear to overcome.

During my use of kratom and the other substances, I did not believe the place I am currently in was possible. 

If you can relate, please try to cultivate an idea of the little engine that could. You don't need to be certain or committed to being sober for the rest of your life. You just need to believe that ""you think you can."" For today. For this next hour. For these next few minutes. And then a little longer the next time. Build up some energy in your motor and see where it takes you.

My sleep has finally returned and restlessness in bed gone. No more need for magnesium before bed and I've stopped taking vitamin C. Seems like other than the normal day cravings (mostly out of just shear boredom) my withdrawals are gone. All I used was magnesium ""Calm"" drink before bed and mega doses of vitamin C during the day and of course my stone cold determination fueled by hatred for the green monster. Feeling pretty normal. Relearning how to navigate the day and my normal responsibilities has been a bit of a task but I'm finding way more fulfillment in them. I'm smiling more, my ""spark"" is back. I'm more appreciative of the world around me and of the life God has blessed me with. Going to church with my family and going out on more family fall adventures. I've learned (for me anyways) that this is all a mental game. And the key to success is figuring out how you want to keep score. For me it's been obviously the number of days clean, but also the continued clarity with reality that becomes more apparent every day. It was definitely a horror show the first few days but now I'm actually kinda embarrassed how scared I was to jump. I'm ok! I feel great! Life has new promise and light for me! I feel closer to God and my family. That's what was at the end of my dark tunnel and I'm ashamed I waited so long. Anyways, just wanted to post some encouragement on this beautiful Friday. Chin up.

I feel so much better the cravings have gone down a lot and I have more energy and motivation. For me the habit is harder to quit than kratom itself. For example I went to visit my cousin on my off day and kratom wasn’t even on my mind until I approached the intersection with the gas station I would always stop at. Instantly I got that feeling in my mouth craving a kratom shot but I just kept driving and looking straight forward. As soon as I got on the highway the craving subsided. On the way back I took a route that avoided the gas stations I usually go to it added an extra 20 minutes but it’s ok because I knew I would have caved in. I’ve been trying to replace the habit of buying kratom. In the morning I work out or go for a run and at night when I get home from work I play the guitar, something I completely stopped while using kratom. For everyone who’s in the first few days keep pushing it gets so much better. Try and fill your day with as many activities as possible. It takes 20 days to create a bad habit and 20 days to break that bad habit.

many of us thought kratom was going to help us get off alcohol, pills, heroin, or “cure” our mental illnesses. i abused alcohol for years because of my lifelong anxiety. i was 6 months sober the first time i tried kratom, but let’s be real, you’re not sober when you’re taking kratom. you’re high. i gave up being sober from alcohol when the kratom stopped “working”, so it’s not going to fix any of your substance problems in the long run. 

anyways, this past weekend, i decided to drink because of my stressful and mentally exhausting first week off kratom. i can’t stress enough how bad of an idea that was. i had a 3-day hangover and i feel okay now, but still not 100% today. i was so depressed and anxious that i felt borderline suicidal. mixing kratom WDs + alcohol hangover = a serious dark night of the soul. but now that i’m kind of on the other side, i feel more motivated and on the right track to dedicate myself to a completely sober life. i don’t HAVE to go through those dark days again if i don’t want to. i can get off the crazy train and live a beautiful life. 

my first 6 months sober from alcohol BEFORE i stupidly introduced kratom into my life were some of the most challenging but best days ever. i felt proud and empowered, not guilty and shameful. i rested my head on my pillow at night knowing that i was taking care of myself and putting myself first. FOMO sucks sometimes but engaging in stupid weekends with people who don’t care about you and having multi-day suicidal hangovers is not worth it lol. i feel hopeful about the future again and i’m ready to be kratom-free, alcohol-free, and just FREE in general. let’s kick addiction’s butt!",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6112222}"

Some of the symptoms I've noticed only occurred once the span of my class had been exhausted and I no longer needed to take kratom. Suddenly but not shockingly did the side effects ambush me blindsidedly.

As per my routine upon waking , i would take kratom on an empty stomach and drink an Earl Grey tea ( i fantasized being a British gentlemen in my HIGH state while listening to classical music and studying my books ). On the first day whre the withdraws were noticeable at about 10Am i felt this feeling of mental anguish and physical discomfort in my stomach, the psychological suffering and physical discomfort only amplified one another for a potent state of despair. It was the middle of summer and my nose ran like no tommorw although it sounds like no big deal, if one were able to relate to this non stop sensation of itch and pain, one would not take this lightly. As soon as i took my 4mg scoops, it would make me feel normal and free of all symptoms but i wouldnt call it a high.

Needless to say, i Did not heed my body's warning and kept using. The straw which broke the camel's back was confirming the fear of hair lost, I would step in the shower and strand after strand of my hair would come out ( im 26 ) and have always had lush hair my entire life, after a quick google search I absolutely freaked out, yes i like being high but losing my hair was NOT WORTH IT. 

Behold upon stopping for a week, my hair lost stopped and my hair looks full and strong again. and after day 3,4 the physical discomfort and emotional torment subsided, HOWEVR upon my doctor check up my doctor was extremely shocked to find my kidney function has declined drastically over the span of 3 months which coincided with the time I took Kratom, I told him about my use and he advised me to stop immediately which I happily obliged.

Last week, as I sat eagerly across the desk from my doctor, he told me that my kidney function has improved to which I know deep down the cause of.

I come to give news as I promised, by making a post again, some of you have already been able to read my story.

Following a burnout at work 3 years ago, I had taken a Benzodiazepine treatment. Starting with 40mg of gallium which is huge. 

I then decreased little by little, until the Vallium had a paradoxical effect on me, so I switched to Tranxilium (In Switzerland) the molecule is clorazepate.

With the kratom, I managed to decrease to 10mg of Clorazepate, which is equivalent to about 7.5mg of Vallium. 

Every year for the past 2 years I have been ordering 500 grams of Kratom for the summer, or taking it 2-3 times a week to help me wean myself off the Benzodiazepines and it has worked pretty well. Each time at the end of the summer I would end up taking it every day and my conscience would tell me to stop before it was too late, and I would go through a cold Turkey withdrawal, I always came out of it pretty well and pretty quickly.

This year the same thing, in June I receive my order and decide to take some to finish my withdrawal. I quickly fell into a daily dosage because I had a lot of work (what a jerk) and the problem is that I am an elite sportsman and I had a super important world competition at the beginning of September. I decided to stop everything two weeks before the event. 14 days without a dose, but I really didn't cope well with the withdrawal this time, the restless legs were very strong, a permanent tension that prevented me from sleeping.

With the advice of some of you, I decided to take kratom again just before and during my competition, that is from August 20th to September 27th.

I took 3 grams in the morning and 5 grams in the evening.

My competition went very well, I finished one of the hardest motorcycle races in the world with a very good result!

On September 27 I stopped, and there followed all the symptoms as described above.

Today it's been 11 days since I've taken anything back. I slept nothing the first 6 days, then from the 7th day to the 8th day very little, and since 2 nights now I sleep but not deeply, but I sleep, I have intense dreams all night long and I have the impression to be awake at the same time.

In the supplements, I took vitamin C, Magnesium, L-Theanine, L-Torysol, Agmatine, Ashwaganda. 2-3 Temesta at the very beginning and I took 2x 1gram of phenibut on day 5 and 6.

But, what did me a lot of good was the 5-HTP, I normally react badly to 5-htp, it reduced my symptoms strongly.

I have been taking it for 3 days and it is like night and day.

I run a lot, I ride my motorcycle, I go to the masseuse, I go to the thermal baths, I do meditation.

I still have these symptoms: 

\- A general tension but one especially which is located at the level of the diaphragm which comes from 3pm

\- Difficulty to fall asleep and to stay asleep

\- The syndrome of the legs without rest, which is nevertheless much less strong than before, but which is always a little present

\- A lack of motivation, even though it is already much better than before

\- Anxiety

I really feel that it is the lack of serotonin that creates these internal tensions at the level of the diaphragm and the head, also a difficulty to breathe, and with the 5-HTP it really reduced this problem. Even if it is still present, but less and less strong.

In any case, this is my story! I thank again this forum to exist because I spent hours to read all the testimonies, I am grateful to you, and if we can help each other what a bonus!

I love you, take care of yourself, relapse is not a weakness, there is a time for everything.

My advice/insight for those who slip is: it’s much darker after a relapse but the rebound can be shorter. What I mean by that is coming off a relapse seems harder than the first quit because mentally you’re discouraged and tired and any physical discomfort is frustrating cause you’ve already put in time. “Why am I doing this again?” And maybe your support structure is less enthusiastic than the first or second or even third time 

There’s light at the end of the tunnel and it’s much closer than you think 

I was a 2 year 30-40gpd quit several times user. Got clean two months, felt great! Relapsed and used for three weeks and hit a nasty bottom. I was so low the first few days quitting. I felt no motivation to quit this time. All the things I knew helped me last time (meditation, breathing, exercise, supplements, eating healthy, positive thinking and many more) seemed silly. 

But then right at day 6, like a miracle, the fog lifted and I saw everything clear and all the motivation came back. Crazy to think how a couple days can change ones mind and body 

So here I am day 8, with two days of feeling pretty good and sleeping ok, to tell you that if you slip up and use again you probably will feel some discomfort again and it might seem even harder than before even though you used less or for less time than before but it’s short lived. And all the tools you put in place before are there to pick right back up

I've noticed a lot of people posting about being on day 3 or 4 today. I guess thats just that little sliver on the way out where you feel like talking a little bit and some hope is poking out behind the clouds. But its still shitballs right now. 

Recap - using for 5 years, after break up use escalated to 100-120gpd+. It was nauseating to be alive. I rented a motel room in the desert so i could be far away from everything and kick in a clean room with nothing around to make me feel connected to my life with it. Seemed cheaper than rehab. And it worked for 3 days. But I came back thinking 3 days would do it and Id be on the other side, not really realizing and it was far from over, that just because I could walk now and had some senses back didnt mean I was on the other side. I was sad and confused. Somehow knew I needed to wait longer but didnt want to. Ive been so disconnected from who I was for so many years, i could only remember a life of depression, and never being happy unless I was drunk or high, and then I thought of all the things I accomplished in my life while being on kratom, even though I was feeling terrible for a lot of it. I decided it wasnt worth waiting out and I jumped back on after day 3. Felt good. I could take small doses that still made me feel good again. The break was rejuvinating and solidified my decision. Cut to 7 months later and its totally out of hand again. The highs were starting to be hit or miss. I never know if i was going to take a 9g dose and feel great and id get shit done, or if it was going to make me puke, either way I was going to take some more on top of it to see if that fixed it, like it ever did. Moderating was all good until 2pm, thats when my maintanence doses got more frequent and higher, high duration shorter and shorter, till by early evening it was doing nothing but making me sweaty and anxious, and id go to bed saying ill just take less than that tomorrow, every day, repeating the same thing over and over again. Its crazy how you can look in the mirror and know that you have absolutely no control of yourself, and not just fucking drop it, but at the same time i guess thats what having no control means. My anger and fits were getting weird and disruptive to my friends who have no idea that I take this stuff. I was fucked.

On one of those days where the shit was making me feel weird, agitated, and unattentive, also happened to be a day where I got stuck somewhere longer than i expected, triple dosing to be social, but I felt brain fog, and couldnt think straight, then I had to ride my motorcycle home. I feel pretty comfortable, even out on the Los Angeles freeways, but this time I just couldnt think straight, car pulled into my lane too quick, coulda seen it coming, coulda braked slower, coulda done a few things, but i hit the brakes hard and layed the bike down at 70mph. Luckily I was wearing my good helmet, and not one of my more low profile mr-cool helmets, because it saved my life. head hit the ground pretty damn hard. I got some mean road rash from the skid, up my arms and legs, and as soon as i stopped sliding i had to immediately roll out of the way of an SUV. So I was almost toast. Paramedics came, I hid all my non visable wounds from them and said it was just a scrape on the wrist because I dont want to go to the hospital and deal with all that shit, not to mention being stuck there and not being able to dose. Lucky for me (I guess?) I was so chill from being high they took it that I was calm and fine and let me go. Bike seemed ok, I had some tools in my saddle so I was able to fix some swinging loose shit and was about to hop back on, and the cops were like ""ok were not going to stop you if you feel ok to do this but you should just tow home"" and I was like nah nah nah wait wait yeah let me do that. I realized I wasnt going to get any awards for getting back on a bike 20 minutes after a crash. So I had a nice, uncomfortable ride home with the AAA driver who told me that jesus saved me, and started describing in detail how many body parts hes seen on the freeway. It was like an hour in traffic back to my place, and this dude was going on about it. He said he saw a lady catch fire crawling out of a wreckage and threw herself over the side of the 101, he said he found a baby's head in a back seat, I was like ""hold up, what? A baby's head? Man, this has been enlightening, but as a recent crash survivor im going to exersize my right to quiet time for a fucking minute while I think about mortality, ill let you know where I wind up on the whole jesus thing"".

And then when I got home I used super hard, and decided to drink a bit with it because hey im alive. Im a recovering alcoholic, so this wasnt really a cool move, and obviously sobriety was thrown out the window when i got into kratom, but i wasnt counting in, you know, denial - to me kratom was a cool way to stay off alcohol without going to meetings, but there I was, fucked up on both. And I stayed fucked up on both for a week, not going into work, not telling friends, just hiding in my hidey-hole and being twacked. Thats when that old suicidal depression started up, havent felt that in a while, and that moved me a bit. Like either I die out there in the road like an idiot, or I die in my house torturing myself, or I just stop and see what happens. So I stopped.

&#x200B;

Day 4. Its still pretty ugly. Ive been taking a lot of melatonin and valerian and shit to sleep, but I dont recommend it honestly. It leaves me feeling really destroyed in the morning (3am). the sleep hangover is bad. Its better to sleep for 2 hours and feel like shit, than sleep for 4 hours and feel like mega-shit. Im going to try to not abuse sleep meds tonight and just see what happens. Ive been going for walks, and taking multiple showers. Helps in small bursts, like now when I feel like writing. But it fades in and out. Tried cleaning up a little bit in the energetic moments because my house is thrashed from being numb to it for so long. Every single corner of the room is littered with the pills. I prefered the capsules over the sludge drink, so they where everywhere. Every nook and crany. 3 or 4 for every time ive ever unleashed something from my pocket and let some spill, or every time i threw a bunch back and didnt care that some hit the floor. Full blown junkie. So i had the experience of confronting the option to use like 20 times today. every time going straight to the toilet, so im feeling good about that. Not only did i not take any kratom today, i pissed on some. 

But since today is day 4 - that means that tomorrow is day 5. If its even 10% better then Ill be happy.

In fact, I've come to realize these past 5 days or so that I wake up feeling good and ready to tackle the day and then I smoke flower or do dabs and I feel stuck, heavy, tired, sleepy, all that for the rest of the day. Doesn't matter if I just take a dab of pure d9 thc, it ruins me for the rest of the day. I did it today and I regret it because I have stuff to do and feel horrible now. THC isn't going to be a regular part of my life anymore, and I think I may stay away from delta 9 permanently except for on my 100th birthday or something. Delta 8 doesn't make me feel stuck and heavy and all of that, but I'd likely be better without it. 

I do get restless legs at night for 2-4 hours unless I take 400mg or so of magnesium glycinate, then I sleep fine. I also really want to get away from nicotine because it makes me anxious. I really wanted to spend these days cycling but it's been raining. Might just have to go cycling in the rain bc it's been a few days and I need the exercise now. 

Also, I've been having cravings, but I've not been fanning the flames. I cut them off from fuel and just let them burn out. They are romanticised memories, I vividly recall what kratom was like when I first started taking it instead of how horrible Ive felt for the past 16 months taking it every day. It's almost hard to recall just how much it sucked taking it, but I'm reminded by it similarly by how much THC is wrecking my functionality right now. 

I almost didn't take that dab this morning and I wish I hadn't. Won't make that mistake tomorrow. Idk if I'll phase out THC and then nicotine or just drop both at once and go on the bike hard for a week every day?

Also, I thought I had hypermagnesemia from taking too many magnesium glycinate supplements because I had urinary retention bad at night for a few nights in a row. Idk if I was right but I've cut down on the magnesium and am no longer dealing with that issue.

1) Waking up and going as long as possible without dosing

2) Taking half of my usual dose when I do decide to dose

3) Taking my usual dose when my willpower fails 

I record the times and amounts for every dose that I take. I have done this tapering method for two days, and I have actually been able to reduce my dosage to 20gpd so far.

I do feel withdrawals in the morning, but the challenge of going as long as possible helps me push through the withdrawals.

For context, this is the longest I’ve gone without taking kratom, in over 4 years. I’ve been a casual user of opiates, with dependent tendencies, for about 13 years. My MIL got huge scripts of oxy (contin and codone) and was more than willing to share. 12/31/16, my closest brother died. Several months later I found kratom. It gave me the peace, without the side effects! Yay! Lies. A few months ago, I was in the ER with stroke level blood pressure. 203/139. I knew it was the kratom, but didn’t want to give up that numb feeling. 3 months of watching my BP rise after dosing, I’m finally done. 

Timeline (because this is what I REALLY needed in the thick of WD). 

Day 1: 12 hours CT. Cold/hot flashes. Sweats. Irritable but tolerable. 24 hours CT, beginning to shake (bed time and sleep never comes). 

Day 2: 36 hours CT. Horrible. Wanting to crawl out of my own skin. Can’t get out of bed. Maybe I should taper. Just a little to take away this feeling. I still have a bottle on the counter. No, I got this. Maybe not? What could a little hurt? Maybe smoke weed instead. BINGO!!! I actually feel worse now, but my head is now adamant that I can (and need to) do this. **finds sub reddits** yep. I MUST get through this. 48hours CT. OMG! I made it a full 2 days! I’ve never even been able to take that long of a tolerance break!!!! If I can get some sleep before going back to work tomorrow, I’ll be ok. 

Day 3: shit, I don’t feel much better. Not like I used to when I would DT from opiates. The hard part should be over???? WTF?? Ok, I still got this. Reddit says to OD on vitamin C. Got it. 72 hours CT. At work. Omfg I should have called out. I’m not ok. I can do this. 

Day 4: 84 hours CT. I can’t stop sneezing, but when my bladder woke me up, I didn’t limp to the bathroom???? Do I feel better???? I’m freezing, but that’s pre-kratom normal!!! Omg, I DO FEEL BETTER!!!!!! FUCK YEAH! I DEFINITELY GOT THIS!!!! Do I feel 100%? Absofuckinglutely NOT, but ya know? I feel a hell of a lot better than I did on almost every dose, for the past year, maybe 2. 

Because if we are being honest, how often did our last dose actually make us feel worse? Idk, maybe I’m alone on that one. I have weird body chemistry. I’m writing all of this because I truly had to go hour by hour, and hopefully this finds the ones that need it. Keep pushing y’all. 🖤

EDIT: Day 6 now. I’m sore. So so so sore. I have autoimmune diseases, and have been in chronic pain for years. One of the many reasons I turned to kratom. Ibuprofen and CBD are helping to take the edge off, but damn it, I hurt. On the plus side, I’m singing again. Not any good at it, but I’ve always been the type to sing ALL DAY LONG. Literally. Lost that years ago and just thought, “I guess this is who I am now.” I still can’t believe I’m one day away from a full week. 🤯

DAY FREAKIN SEVEN!!!!!! I’ve made it an entire week!!!!! Last night, I laughed for REAL, at something a customer said.

Yesterday I took my last dose at 6pm on purpose because I know at about 4 or 5am, WDs will make me up. Sure enough, just before 5am, I woke up at 4:50 with watery eyes and RLS.

I've read people talking about horrible nightmares about slaughter and death, but it's absolutely not the case for me. I didn't have any dreams at all prior to quitting kratom, I thought that was because of daily marijuana usage but turns out I was dead wrong. I had multiple extremely vivid and powerful dreams each night, every single one of them awaking me and leaving me with some deep emotion making it difficult to fall asleep again. The last dream, both yesterday and today was the most powerful, bringing literal tears to my eyes with the sheer sense of deep nostalgia, bittersweetness, longing and sadness. So strong that it would be impossible to fall back asleep again. I don't really feel negative about the experience, although it was really hard to fall asleep with the rls and racing mind. The dreams were so mundane and yet so powerful I can't stop thinking about them and feeling the emotions they induced in me.

I’m not new to Reddit but this happens to be my first post/question. I’m on day two of quitting kratom after a very long and slow taper. I quit at 5gpd although I wish I’d gone even further. I was just so ready to be done with this, and it isn’t the first time I’ve quit. I always relapse. This time I want to do things differently. 3 things that always cause me to relapse, pain management as I have a lot of real back problems at 33, the lack of dopamine and serotonin or maybe just boredom, and being unable to sleep at night. At 25 I went into rehab for a serious opiate addiction, methadone mostly but anything would work. I was three years clean when I discovered kratom and at first it was a miracle. Unbeknownst to me it was just another rabbit hole. With very conflicting thoughts ultimately to me it’s just another crutch. So anyway weeks before I quit I started taking vitamins and supplements suggested for quitting and tapering. Right now I am taking a multivitamin, vitamin b complex, vit d, Maca, 5htp, and l dopa. I’ve also explained to my doctor what’s going on and he prescribed me Horizant, which is a gabapentin derivative and it’s for restless legs which as you know is the worst. I’ve really started feeling as if this l dopa is a huge game changer, although I know it should be temporary. I want to add a new sup I bought which is a combo of magnesium and ashwaghanda. My question is, is this too much? Am I putting myself in danger by taking so many supplements? Do any of you know if anything I’ve listed interacts badly with each other? I’m in therapy and am making great strides in doing this right this time. I just want to be safe. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Tia!",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47602373}"

Also, how productive I would be and how satisfied I would feel after I were done.  I didn't do it but it was such a sneaky thing and, given that my WD was kind of mild (I mean terrible but not as terrible as some other people's), I did think ""well, maybe just this once"" briefly.  

I'm still struggling with focus and bad moods and man would it have been nice to forget about all that for a while to just get a bunch of work done, go on a long run, and not resent my family for a few hours...

The anhedonia is getting better in that it is not constant but I do still have a day or two here and there where I feel completely hopeless.  Luckily, I don't think about Kratom during those times but if there's something I miss, it's not having to deal with normal emotional cycles.  I realized recently that, though I have never made a daily habit out of a substance besides kratom and caffeine, I have a difficult time dealing with what normal feels like; this is not Kratom-related, it was always like this.  It was easier to stay sober throughout the week when I knew I had to go to work every day since most things give me hangovers but knowing that I do not have to put my face on or get a good night's sleep and can just go to my Zoom meetings in sweats really makes it difficult to make the argument that substances in general are a bad idea.

2021-10-05 16:43:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/q255o7/day_3_update/,Day 3 update,"I took my last dose saturday night. This is my 7th time trying to quit in the last 5 years. The longest I've ever gotten before is a week, so here I am, 90% of the time I give up on day 2. The cravings to give up on the kick come on really hard at least once an hour, and those are tough. Especially today, because ive gotten out of bed and put on clothes for the first time in 3 days. and being able to move means im able to go to the store and get some if I wanted. But Im checking in with the group instead. Trying to kill some time reaching out and saying thank you to everyones encouragement so far. So this might be long and a lot of nonsense, but im just journaling here to stay busy I guess.

Even though I havent really slept, more like just passed out for 1 - 2 hour blocks and endured horrifying nightmares, it feels like ive rested somehow. The bleakness is heavy though. The fatigue makes me feel crazy, too weak to move, too awake to sleep. I managed to shake it off, and make myself move, drank a little coffee, not too much to trigger anxiety, but just a little in hopes it could take some of the sleep-spell off. Took a shower, went for a short walk, felt good for a moment to move and breathe fresh air. It had rained overnight here in Los Angeles, and the smell of wet asphalt is always nice. I noticed my sense of smell came back ferociously. Like the smell of every single leaf and puddle was up my nose. It was a welcome feeling outside, but works the opposite inside. The smell of my rancid sweat sheets, and two-days-unattended litterbox are bitter and intense.

Taking ashwaganda, black seed oil, magnesium, 5-HTP, and who the fuck knows if its helping or not, but im not trying to study the effects of with-or-without so im just gonna take it and say its getting me through.

I didnt want to introduce any new chemicals, no crutches or anything that could make me feel weird and lead me to give up or get strung out on something else, like xanax or something, but I figured a micro dose of the psylocibin might be a nice mood stabilizer and change perspective a bit. Micro dosing mushrooms has helped me with some bad days in the past, on and off kratom, so i gave it a shot. It started off good. I let some ibuprofen kick in and went for another walk. I could feel some emotions flood back, and it quickly became overwhelming where I was crying at falling leaves, and the way gasoline smells, and shit like that. It gave me a burst of energy where I went for a run, and Ive always known that exercise is super helpful and a good sign of coming back to life, even thought doing it is usually an impossible task. From my run I decided to brave a social interaction and go to the store to buy some milk for my protein shakes and try to work out. Focusing on the health goals of not being fucked up, like gaining weight back and being in shape. Coming back from the corner store with my gallon of milk I passed by the Guatemalan consulate that always has a long line mid-week. I honestly have no idea what a consulate does. But theres always people in line and they got their food vendors around. But today in line there was like 5 midgets, I dont know if they were all brothers, or if they all work at the same place or what, but thats when my guts shifted and I felt like I accidentally took more than a micro dose. Not a full dose, but enough where shit was uh-oh-weird. Listening to some sad ass music in the ear buds and seeing a troupe of guatamalan midgets was enough to send me into a freak out and I ran back home. I figured Id slam this shake and try to do pushups until I couldn’t move as a way of escaping, but as soon as I uncapped the milk i could smell it was supremely turned and smelled like cold fish. I laugh cried on the floor for a while. Spent a few hours rolling around seeing weird shit I wasnt really in the mood for, but it seems like its done now. Now im trying to move and clean up a bit. Maybe I should be a little more careful with psychedelics in this tedious and painful process. But Im an addict, Im always going to think that I have some clever way to avoid feeling bad.

My goal now is to clean a little bit and kill some of the stale house smell, and above all, not use today. If day 4 is incrementally better then I'll be happy.

Are used to be in amazing shape but extremely good shape. I had great hair, I could sleep through the night, I didn’t have night sweats, I never had anxiety. That’s just the start of the list. Of the last five years those things have all changed. I’m slowly starting to figure out more and more how many of those things are directly affected to heavy cream use. I will come and go in phases. I will be sober for a few weeks then fall back into it, then I will be a very mild user for two months or so and then get into heavy use and have a panic attack about my use and quit only to fall back into it a few weeks later. I can’t stand this anymore. How the fuck do you actually make yourself stop? I have never tapered before, I’ve only ever gone cold turkey. I’m about to be in a situation where I will have a month off and that is going to be my time where I go cold turkey. But I have probably a month until then. I need to go cold turkey between now and then. I’m definitely ramping back into a heavy used phase. Right now it’s not that bad though, Atake 4 to 5 g about five times a day. Just a few months ago it was only 3 g 3 to 4 times a day. Does anyone have a recommended tapering schedule for how to work this down. I don’t want to be dead inside when I go Coulter key if I can avoid it. Thank you all and I love you. I’m ashamed to be happening to talk to you again but here I am.

I normally don’t post anything but I thought I should share my story so far. I thought It might help other people out there and if anybody has any questions needs someone to talk to I’m here as well. 

I started taking kratom about 4 years ago mainly for my PTSD, depression, anxiety. kratom worked great for me for all the reason stated above, but I then started taking it everyday instead of using it on my really bad days. I was using about 25 30 gpd. After awhile I started to realize that it just wasn’t for me anymore. I was irritable, depressed, not wanting to go out, made up excuses to stay home, and not wanting to do anything. Note : That I have always been an outgoing energetic person. While taking my doses I would always be looking at the clock for the next time I can dose throughout the day. I felt more irritable and depressed between my doses then feeling good. There was more bad then good so This is when I decided to quit.

I started a rapid taper about 2 months ago I would take my first dose in the morning then I would go as long as I could before I couldn’t take it anymore. I did this for about a month or two I then got to the point where I could take 2 g in the morning 2 in the afternoon and 2 before bed. 5 days ago I took 1 g in the morning and that was it. I still feel sick like I have a cold I thought that would go away by now but has anybody had a runny nose, sneezing cold like symptoms for this long after quitting?

     I used kratom to help detox from a 7 year prescribed subutex habit. Well that led to 2 years of kratom addiction. I'd say I was taking around 40gpd at the height of it. Let me tell you the k started taking a serious toll on my body. I tapered down to about 12gpd by January and just couldn't quit. 

     July of this year I made the decision that I've had enough. I went CT at 12gpd. I went through the acutes and had myself convinced that I would never take it again. I was feeling pretty good and felt like life was getting back to normal. I really didn't have any cravings until about 45 days in. That's when PAWS hit hard. I kept telling myself ""This too shall pass"". But, I finally caved after 3 months CT.

    I went down the road and bought some head shop kratom. Before this, I always ordered my leaf online. I figured the head shop stuff would be garbage and wouldn't really cause any harm. Well, boy was I wrong! I took about 2.5g for a job interview and then another 5g through out the rest of the day. I felt so good, my husband and I went and played pool. Of course that led to drinking.

   The day all of that shenanigans happened was Thursday. None of it was worth it. One day of ""feeling normal"" has literally rekindled the k wd. Granted it's much more mild. But, it seriously sucks. My nose is running, I'm sneezing, temp issues, mild rls, the whole gammet. I didn't think one day would rekindle the acutes! 

    I know it was a small slip up and I don't want to throw those 3 months away. I guess I'll just consider it a setback. My husband and I decided we are going to try for a ""Sober October"".

I am feeling pretty normal these days and enjoying life without that battle , but at times the boredom and fatigue of every day life without substances gets to me and I think “once couldn’t hurt.” Whenever that thought pops into my head, I think about my past self. I think about the many failed attempts, the missed days of work, the multiple day ones that were lost to relapse. I think about the girl who wanted to be where I am now so badly, and who was afraid it would never happen because she didn’t have the strength. I think about her pain and hopelessness, her lost sense of self, her grey face and brittle hair. If I would have told her then that four months from now she would be completely free, would repair failing relationships, hike mountains, run a half marathon, start seeing a therapist, read books and feel genuine joy again, all without kratom, she wouldn’t have believed it. So now when I think “just once”, I think about her, and I respect her struggle. How could I make it all for nothing? How could I tell her that she made it, and it wasn’t all for nothing, but now I’m going to put everything she went through at risk to feel a mediocre 45 min high? I can’t do it to her, which is why I’m embracing the highs and lows of sober life.

I've been on the goop for 2 years, 15 gpd maybe 20 at the absolute most. I was originally told from the guy who runs the head shop that withdraw from the green was no worse than kicking caffeine (specifically 1 cup of coffee) looking back it's hard not to laugh at the absurdity of that statement. The first dose was even given to me for free in true dealer fashion. I've never felt like I've had an addictive personality which has made this experience even more difficult. I have typically been the steel cage, brickhouse type of person that everyone else leans on. Anyways, tomorrow is week 2. The first 3 days were pretty horrific for me. I've never experience what I would later describe as ""impending doom"" before. But impending doom I felt. After maybe day 6 is when everything really started turning around for me, when I finally realized I'm bigger than this, stronger than this, more of a complex creature that doesnt need something as dumb as K. My soul was never meant to be chained down by something so dirty. Every day I pause and stare myself down in the mirror and tell the man looking back how proud I am. I reach in my pocket and instead of finding pills I grasp on to a lucky silver coin my father gave me. With every day clarity returns and I realize how much stronger I am. Every. Damn. Day. You are stronger than this, I absolutely promise you. The withdrawals, anxiety and moments of depression are shoveled back into my engine as motivation not to slip. There are people counting on me, people I would do anything for and I will not let them down again. Changing my attitude has really helped me as I've realized a fair chuck of this addiction has been just physical habit (reaching in my pockets, dosing at particular times, just something to do) Once I got it out of my system and found new things to do with myself the days have really turned around for me. I dont drink or smoke and only used vitamin C and magnesium at night to help sleep. We are complex creatures, beautiful things and our bodies deserve better than this. I want you to know I love you, I truly care about you all and I'm sending you my strength and motivation fueld by hatred for the K to help you find peace. God bless you.

A bit of history about my journey.,"I just want to give a short introduction. I’ve been using Kratom for about 5 years now. I was an occasional user until 2019, when I became a daily user. I peaked at 30g a day (single dose) and have tapered to 15g a day (single dose) over the last year. I ran out this weekend and made the decision not to re-up. 

I do have to give credit to Kratom for helping me to cut back on drinking. I was a 6 beer a day drinker until a few months ago, not including binges. Now I’m down to 1-2 a week, if at all. Kratom also helped me to stay away from stimulants, which I’ve now been free of (apart from an 8oz daily coffee) for over a year.

My cannabis consumption has gone up, but I am not a heavy user and I don’t plan on increasing any further.

I finally feel as though I can move on to quitting Kratom. 

Any tips for mitigating the withdrawal effects would be greatly appreciated. Specifically, the cold like symptoms I am currently dealing with. I work for a company that does not provide sick pay, so taking days off comes at a price. I am double vaxxed against Covid, but still need to be careful when coming to work, even with the sniffles. Would an antihistamine work?

My doc gave me this stuff called ""Trazedone"" to help me sleep better, I have been sleeping better daily but it wasn't up to enough hours consistently and I was getting a little ""punchy"".  So I took this stuff he gave me and my night was for lack of a better word tortured.  I had ""lucid dreaming"" and dreamt the  first half of  the night that I was awake, even though I wasn't, or was I?    Sheesh, I won't ever take that again...I am drinking lots of caffeine trying to cut thru the fog.    What's wrong with these doctors, the guy prescribed me stuff and it feels like it almost killed me, or just made me mental.   Maybe he is a witch doctor, sick of these docs flinging drugs.

Other than that my stomach is greatly improved, I have had some moments of happiness, drug free happiness, improvements in my focus and I can write more coherently as I had lost that ability for some time it felt...but last night was the worst.  I will dump the trazedone  today.  Worst stuff ever.   

A friend in this group said recovery is not linear, and this is true.  Still it trends upward on an overall scale and for that its so worth getting off the sludge.  Funny with other drugs i have missed them when quitting, not the Kratom, I don't miss it and I loathe it.    

It was ruining my life like alcohol does the alcoholic, there is nothing good I can say about it.  I wish all of you the best today and carry on with the putting as much distance as possible between you and the Kratom.  a religious man once told me that the devil was cast out of heaven and he took wine and spirits with him; I believe the devil  also had Kratom in his bag too, or opiates...keep the faith, I will!",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7006659}"

I have a long history of both sporadic and regular substance abuse. Before I started kratom I'd gone through long periods of time (~6 months) of daily cannabis and daily benzo use - both of which I managed to quit by myself - as well as kinda frequent use of all sorts of drugs from opiates and benzoes to psychedelics and dissociatives.

Since December last year I've only been doing kratom and have not been feeling any cravings for other drugs during this time, which I'm grateful for. However, I also know that my kratom dependence is harming my quality of life, my family relations and my personal economy (which is not doing great anyway) so I've decided to quit it.

My daily usage has been quite high. I never measure out my doses but I've been running through about a kilo per month, split in about three or four doses every day. Now I'm pretty sure that the stuff I've been getting is not of very high quality (I'm in a European country and there are not many distributors here). 

I've been spending the past week only taking the bare minimum required to *barely* stave off my withdrawals (maybe about 1/3 of my usual dosage, or about one large teaspoon) until yesterday at 22:00 when I took the absolute last from my stash. It's now 14:00 and I'm feeling kinda fine. I get the occasional chills running down my spine and I'm more tired than usual, but otherwise it's not too bad. 

Gonna go get some ibuprophen and try to manage through a couple of meetings that I have scheduled today and hopefully it won't get much worse than this! I've got work tomorrow and I'd hate to have to call in sick simply because I'm an addict.

Good luck to everyone here trying to quit like I am! Even if my physical withdrawal isn't too bad atm I know that the mental dependence is really tough to beat.

I'm going to update this post regularly mostly as a personal journal.


edit: 18:00 now and I'm feeling about the same. The ibuprophen didn't really do that much I think. My stomach is really moving for the first time in a long while, though 😂

edit 2: 38 hours since my last dose. Woke up abou 90 minutes ago with the freezies. Atleast I slept like a baby thanks to my Alimemazine. Took some ibuprophen and now I'm feeling about the same as I did yesterday. I don't think it'll get much worse than this so I will probably be fine at work, even though I'd prefer to stay at home. Gonna take a hot shower, eat lunch and play some dark souls III before I have to get going. My discomfort comes and goes in waves it feels like.

edit 3: 44 hours in. I think I'm already feeling better. I'm not 100% since it still comes and goes in waves. I'm slightly more irritable and my libido has been going crazy since i last dosed (i think the kratom dulled it, i once went a month without orgasming on it simply because I had no drive). At work now and it is going fine.

edit 4: T+63h. I'm feeling more tired than usual. Don't have much energy to do much except watching YouTube in bed.

Week one was pretty terrible. Psychologically I seem to have had it better than many folks here in that I was not super depressed or anxious, but I had insomnia, total lack of motivation, restless legs, 24/7 nausea, and pain in my GI.

Week two there was something of a turning point at day 11. I noticed my nausea lift for a few hours and some actual hunger return. The pain felt more like an itch, if that makes any sense, and I ate a full meal for the first time. Of course this fairly ruined the rest of my GI tract for a day but it felt nice to eat with some sense of pleasure.

Friday was two weeks and I actually went out to dinner - and socialized without being high. This was a real challenge in the sense that for several years I had become dependent on kratom (or opiates) to deal with social anxiety and hanging out with people. Really, I don't need any kind of drug, but kratom or opiates made it a lot more fun. In one sense this was the healthiest thing about kratom - making me more social.

While I was less comfortable speaking, I noticed I had more capacity for listening to the people I was talking with. Honestly, my behavior while high was pretty lame now that I think about it. Not that I was a total ass, and often other people were drinking, but my ""real"" style is much more balanced between listening and yacking it up. That was a nice observation.

The best news I can report however is that my motivation is slowly coming back. At one point, if I didn't dose kratom, the dishes weren't going to get done. If I had a stressful meeting at work - I dosed. The dose creep was getting crazy like everybody here probably knows. What started as one or two times a week became daily or multiple times per day. I would take a couple days off to tell myself I wasn't dependent, but that was total BS. 

Kratom depletes your organic motivation. At first it gives, but then it takes. It feels much better to have something like my own directed life force returning. It's more organized and sustained if less meteoric and fun.

I'm still dealing with GI pain and RLS. At the risk of TMI, the level of gurgling noise and muscle contractions going on is nothing I've ever experienced. What the hell guts? But it does seem to be slowly getting better. Maybe at the one month mark I will have something more to report.

I'm now sleeping about 4-6 hours a night, which isn't enough, and I often get woken up by GI stuff. But it's a LOT better than week one which was an abyss of insomnia and scattered cognition. Mornings are still fucking weird.

Anyway, some progress to report... But also the realization that checking OUT of Hotel Kratom is a lot more difficult than checking IN.

I just fooled myself with the “harmless and natural” hype.  I was addicted to heroin, cocaine, alcohol..you name it in the past and have went through recovery a million times.  I’m 34 now and when I started taking Kratom I was around 28 or 29 and I thought I found the cure for everything wrong in my life.  I fell in love with Kratom immediately.  It took away my insecurities and my anxiety and made me talkative and approachable.  It didn’t make me feel geeked out like cocaine or as “numb” when I used heroin.  This stuff was perfect.  
    Fast forward a few months and I’m using it every day at least 3 times a day and I can’t sleep a wink without it.  I wake up at 2 am in full blow existential panic.  I figured I could deal with the bullshit because I needed Kratom, it was my safety blanket.  It kept me from drinking alcohol and using other drugs.  I stopped feeling really good from my doses but still got a nice little buzz and some “motivation” for about an hour.  After a few hours my joints start aching slightly and I have an overall feeling of physical and mental discomfort, but this just meant it was time for me to dose again.  Everything revolves around my dose, and I could t wait for the next one.
     I could draw this out forever, so I’ll just fast forward to now.  I’m 27 days CT from Kratom.  This is probably the fourth time I chose to withdrawal and try to get off the stuff for good.  By the end of each run with Kratom, I have no libido, very little energy besides the first half hour after my first couple doses of the day.  I have little motivation to do anything and my creativity is gone.  I’m just going through the motions waiting for my next dose.  Empty soul.
   I know how long it takes for me personally to get back to somewhat normal after quitting long runs (long runs meaning over a year, this time for me was over two) of daily use.  I’m at day 27 like I mentioned earlier,and I’m not at baseline.  I’m still depressed and anxious and some days I feel like I can barely function.  Some days I have motivation, some days none at all.  Kratom beats the shit out of your brain, I’ve had shorter paws with heroin use.  The mental wreckage is rough for me with Kratom.  Shit is no joke.  I don’t want it anymore, it’s not real life.

I gotta say put up some really negative posts my first couple days on this CT.

What seemed impossible now seems achievable and almost exciting! 

I ran 8 miles! Just flying with endorphins

Granted I still have mild symptoms and am not getting any sleep it was just so nice to get a break from the constant wd symptoms, anxiety and shame

About 50GPD for 3 years.

I had a job in Japan where kratom is illegal so I had no choice but to quit but had been looking forward to using this trip as a chance to quit. At the same time I was absolutely terrified of quitting in a foreign country with absolutely no chance of getting kratom if it got too bad.

The first week was absolute hell! Sleeping 2-4 hours a night at best, severe depression and anxiety,  missing my two daughters and wife every second of the day and night was really taking a toll on me mentally,  being alone all day due to the 13hr time difference with people from home.  The overwhelming sadness that came over me but inability to cry was pretty bad.  Felt like I swallowed a golf ball for days like if I just bursted in tears I could release the tension in my chest but couldn’t let anything out for more than a few seconds.

With all that being said my symptoms drastically got better around day 7-9. Sleep got better and was able to get 6-8 hours of sleep after day 10-11ish (using the jet lag as an excuse was helpful for my mental state during the first week).  I am on the other side now and am so unbelievably grateful for the strength I dug out of myself.  I’m so grateful for the strength I had to not back out of this trip for kratom(I thought about it a lot as the trip grew closer).

I was so scared taking my last dose in the San Francisco airport bathroom 10 minutes before boarding the flight to Japan.

I hope I’m strong enough to remember every aspect of this trip when I get home in 2 weeks and drive passed the kratom store.",16,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.36497146}"

Trying to do everything I can from keeping me from waking up tomorrow and trying to dig some out. I realize i could still drive to the store and get some if I break, but I really dont want to. I dont know who I am any more.

Last 5 years ive used kratom to feel normal and live. Ive tried quitting so many times and i go through the worst withdrawals but I never make it past the end of the week. I feel empty and scared without it. I know I just need more time off it to get back to normal, but I fear the time it takes, and I dont trust myself to let it go long enough. I feel like I need it to function, but im also aware of how dysfunctional it makes me. I cant do anything with out it, and by the end of the day my maintenence doses are too much and it starts to make me feel icky and sad. 

This is a weird story about why I got hooked but years ago I took a bunch before a date, because I was nervous. I wanted to be chatty and comfortable. And I won the heart of this amazing person because I was so outgoing and fun. within a week I knew I needed to get off it because it was making me feel like shit, but I didnt, because I was instantly afraid that I would become boring. It became a drug that I needed because I thought I couldnt be myself. Over the years of our relationship she would see me struggle at times, being weird and uncomfortable, but I never told her that I took this. I just continued to use until my doses were high and my personality was suffering from being perpetually uncomfortable. Eventually the relationship failed, maybe not because of this specifically, but it didnt help. Its been 7 months since we broke up, and my kratom use has gotten worse and worse. Im sick by 2pm, and i cant stop taking it. I use Zzquill every night to fall asleep, and then I wake up sweaty and panicked, and I lay in bed playing idle clicker games furiously as a distraction while I wait for the morning dose to kick in so I can move.

I know thats all irrelevent and the point is we all just gotta quit, but i just wanted to pour my heart out for a second. I cant count the insane amount of things in my life that are in ruins, emotionally, phsyically, and financially. But I know everyone out there who was hooked on this the way I am, you know what im talking about.

Reading all the stories, listening to all the advice, I stocked up on recommended medicines; magnesium, black seed oil, 5htp, ashwagandawana (how ever you spell that). I have water and food. I took a week off of work. I have my cats. I have stupid idle clicker games on my phone. I got movies. I got a nintendo. I have everything I need to hole up for a minute and take care of this. But Im afraid I wont be able to do it.

&#x200B;

I just want to be normal again. I want to be in charge of my life. Im 35 years old. I have a good career, good friends, and a decent life, but I dont enjoy a single second of it, except for the 30 minutes to an hour a day where the kratom feels like its working like its supposed to.

This was a vent. Thanks for listening. Im going to try to do this, and im going to stay tuned into this subreddit and read success stories, and advice while im going through it.

I was regular cyclist for years for exercise and sometimes for commuting when I used to live in city. I used to be able to do 100 mile rides but my regular was 25 miles which it took me a while to get up to. Kratom interrupted my regular cycling around 5 months ago or so and I've been dying to get back. Well, today I planned on going for a shortish ride in the morning maybe 10 miles or so but I got in the zone full my thick smoothie powering me and I ended up going 25 miles! Of course I have felt amazing for the rest of the day and today has been one where I haven't noticed being in withdrawals besides the morning before I went on the bike ride. 

My muscles even didn't seem heavy today except for the regular fatigue from exercise! Could also be because I've switched from smoking indica flower all day to just a few pure THC dabs only in the evening. 

I felt normal today. I can't believe I've made it this long. Been considering the use of DMT or psilocybin to help reset my brain and point my self in THE direction. Might not post that stuff here but rather on actual psychedelic subs bc this place probably doesn't need it I'm guessing

Not having to think of the next dose is so blissful. I can actually focus on my self and my family. Nights are not bad I get to sleep, I actually eat properly. I remember not eating just to get a better hit from the kratom. My stomach seems to be getting better. Overall 10/10 would def recommend quitting this shit. I even ordered a pair of rollerblades. Something I did as child very well. Gonna give that a go. I have been walking about 2 miles a day. Doing wim hof daily and taking cold baths and showers.the worse/best thing about quitting is doing all these healthy things to keep yourself busy. Staying busy helps a lot.

This has been going on far too long. If i keep drinking and taking kratom by myself every night im gonna fucking kill myself. My liver is def gonna give out im 21 and alrdy feel wierd bcuz of my drug abuse. I want to be healthy. I want to be happy. I want to be productive. I want new friends who dont always revolve around drugs. 

The friends thing is kinda a hard part of it. I have p much 0 support system behind me quitting, my ""friends"" r like whatever cuz they still using, i don't have a gf, and like actually real close friends, my family just shames me for using in the first place, so I feel really alone alot. Big reason i used kratom so long, it kept me company at my lowest times. But it also brought me there. Before kratom i was so much happier and outgoing and creative, kratom and alcohol killed it all. I used to be an actual person, and I have turned into a hollow shell of who I once was.

The only thing i can do is give this suffering meaning and focus on improving day by day, tbh i have already made big steps in these last 10 days. And i need to remember that 1 dose will most likely reset everything and make me go on a month long bender again.

I couldn’t wait for day 7 because I thought I would certainly be myself by then if I could just make it through 6 days of hell. I will say I feel dramatically better than the first few days, the anxiety still gets to me a lot when it arises. The lack of energy makes me feel useless. And the weird pains scare me. I’m having like a sore muscle pain in my shoulder that leads me into a panic that I’m about to have a heart attack, but I slept through the night with the pain and didn’t die so I’m probably not having a heart attack I guess. Today I’m reminding myself that I don’t ever want to have to take something to have fun with my little girl. I never want to have to give myself a bump of anything to play with her. I never want her to see me dependent on anything. I’m going to quit juuling as soon as this withdrawal is over too, I promised myself. And if I can make it through this absolute torment, quitting nic ain’t gonna be *shit*. That way she will be young enough that she doesn’t even remember mommy being hooked on anything. I crave sober happiness, joy, and energy. 2020 triggered a lot of substance abuse for me. I tried a whole lot in a very short period of time and to be frank, each thing ended up almost killing me in some way or another. I’m done. I know who I want to be, I know the kind of mom I want to be, the wife I want to be, the friend I want to be. If you’re thinking about quitting, just make the jump.

Just so I could save all my real gusto for when I decide to jump. 

I thought I was gonna jump from my 6-7 grams three days ago. I even posted “Day 1” that day. I buckled after a few hours. I took the normal 7 or so grams that day. The next day I did the same. Yesterday, what did I do? I took 11. 

I know it’s just one day of having increased my dose. But I’m so mad at myself. I think a part of me feels defeated even trying anymore to taper. But at the same time, a part of me is still fighting. Or I wouldn’t be here posting this right now. 

Fun fact, I slept LESS than any single night of my taper thus far last night. I totally thought at least one “up” side to having splurged yesterday on my dosing would be that I’d get a full night’s sleep. Quite the opposite. I laid in bed until 2:30 am and have to go to work this morning. 

I have been able to recognize what triggered me, and what my thought process was leading up to taking the two extra doses yesterday afternoon/evening. I finally made a decision yesterday to finish a course I enrolled in 6 months ago, it is a course that is required for me to change career directions. I started it 6 months ago and abandoned the idea two months later. Yesterday morning, when I was still very clearheaded, I decided I really DO want to attempt to go this direction for my career change. So, I resolved to start the course again and FINISH it. Then take
the exam. I went back for more kratom Bc on some level, I’m afraid I can’t do the course to completion. I felt like I “needed” just a little more help from kratom to give me that “edge” while studying. I’m also worried I won’t pass the exam as I’ve failed the same exam 2 times 3.5 years ago. 

I have known my kratom use a lot of the time I’ve been on it has been tied to an underlying belief that I, on my own, without ANY substance, am not “enough”. And here with this dose increase after working my ASS off to get to 6-7 grams, that negative belief is rearing it’s head again. 

Just wanted to post this here as it forces me to be honest with myself and you all.

For the relapser - I need something different.

Cause Kratom has literally ruined my life. I went from a high functioning drinker, which I think a lot of society is, to a crazy alcoholic and psychopath within a very short period on Kratom.

After a couple attempts, I finally managed to quit Cold Turkey. The withdrawal symptoms lasted for about a month. Whenever I would try to sit still I would get twitchy, restless etc... especially at night. It’s been 3 months and I’m doing better... except for at night. I’m always tired during the day but at night time, when I try to sleep my body with twitch, or like tense up, and I’ll do like a shudder... it’s like a Tick. If I do fall asleep, I wake up a couple hours later and have to struggle through the twitching all over again.

It’s really frustrating because I used to LOVE bedtime and now I dread it becasue it’s so uncomfortable and leaves me lying awake at the earliest hours of the morning (I’m typing this at 5 am) for a while I used Delta 8 to fall asleep, and it’s great but I don’t want to rely on a substance to help me pass out. 

For a short while I was able to fall asleep and stay asleep, but that was after taking a concoction of stuff like magnesium, Passion flower, L-Theanine, and Black seed oil... but again I don’t like taking things like that! 

I just want it to stop so I can enjoy bedtime again! Is this a symptom of PAWs? I didn’t think I would get much of PAWs since I wasn’t on kratom for that long. I’m not really sure what to do, should I just go to a doctor to get some relief? 

In addition to all of that I have absolutely no motivation to do anything and my anxiety has gotten worse. At this point I’m not sure if that’s just me or if it’s Bc of the withdrawals. 

I’ve been chasing away the voice in my brain telling me to buy more kratom, but I just want to be able to sleep easy again.

Reading your posts has helped me finally find the determination to stop using for good. I’ve been using for four years and I measure by teaspoon and not grams (I unfortunately don’t know how many tsp. are in a gram, if anyone knows please lmk). I’ve been taking 9 tsp for a while and got down to 8 before I decided to start a long tapering schedule. I plan to go down 1/8 of a tsp three times per week (3/8 tsp each week). I’m in my first week and I have cold symptoms, aches, rls, and a major headache. The point of me doing a slow taper was to avoid withdrawal as much as possible, and I can’t stop thinking about how I might have to go 7 months feeling sick everyday if I continue this way. It’s making me consider going CT, but I’m not sure bc I’ve tried before and failed horribly. I was wondering if anyone else has done a long taper, and did your withdrawal symptoms get easier/better over time? Any and all tips would be appreciated as well (for CT or tapering).",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4509612}"

I’m about to get a job with health insurance so I can get actual anti anxiety medication, plus I’ve been using CBD. I have no excuse to keep using this and it’s just holding me back.

I use I think around 8 teaspoons a day. I should probably measure that on a scale, but I imagine they’re roughly consistent being from the same brand etc.

But anyway, how much of a jump is too much with the taper? Can I jump down to four right away, keep it like that, then slowly go more down or something else that works? I can’t cold turkey with this job I’ll be doing. But maybe I’ll do a cold turkey every Saturday, or Sat and Sun, then go back to a steady, level taper during the workweek. Not sure.

What do y’all think? Edit: I guess I’m asking for your experiences. I’m reading the taper guide now, which I guess I should have before posting but oh well. Too hyped I guess. And I think I’ve been taking 12-14 grammes maybe per day. Lot lower than I used, so maybe I’ve been subconsciously tapering.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5082094}"

I very easily became hooked and was spending between $30 and $50 a day. I refuse to go back to it and look forward to getting myself back 100%.
Anyway thanks again and good luck to everyone!

Probably a few months ago where I was explaining that I was trying to quit this stuff and was really struggling.  I'm currently taking about 8-10 gpd and trying to taper.  A taper can be tough, but I have a highly stressful job and three little kids, so I was looking to avoid discomfort as much as possible.  But that's my problem.  I really have an ideal situation for tapering.  My wife knows everything.  I confessed everything to her a few months ago, and, as a result, we locked up a stash in my gun safe (only she knows the code now), and she gives me my daily ration each night before bed.  She also knows all my tricks.  I can't spend a dollar without her knowing.  But months later, I'm still on the same dose...And it's not her fault (she's amazing); it's my fault.  I keep pressuring her and pressuring her.  She's not trained to deal with this.  

What I don't get is that I wake up in the middle of the night feeling anguish over this.  Everything I've seen people mention on this thread is so true to me.  The lies of kratom.  Knowing that I would feel better overall if I just didn't take this crap.  Knowing that I take the pills just to feel okay for about 45 minutes, followed by a quick temper and fatigue.  If the nighttime me was present at all the time, I would have dropped this long ago.  But the person I am in the morning is totally different.  My conviction to end this isn't totally gone, but it's almost gone.  Just another day feeling good; just another day feeling good.  It's not even true anymore and I know it.

It's sad for me to know how resilient my body is, in other words, when I drop the dose (as I have done in the past), it only takes a day or two for me to feel better and the suffering is minimal, yet I still choose this.    I've been off everything.  It's WAY better.  I have motivation; less frustration; more confidence; and I actually feel better physically.  But I choose a substance that increases all those traits for about 45 minutes, only to have them plummet for the remainder of the 23 hours and 15 minutes of the day.  I'm thankful that I'm on a consistent dose; I'm thankful for my wife because I have no way of getting more without her knowing.  But I need get over that desire to have energy and motivation to do everything I need to do.  Those things will come back after the piper is paid.  I just can't bring myself to pay him.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46315673}"

Well, I feel incredible despite some cravings and the feeling of my whole body being made of metal and so heavy to move which comes in a few long waves during the day. 

Other than that, as long as I take at least 600mg magnesium glycinate at night I will fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow and sleep like a log for 9 hours. God I can't explain how great that is after not sleeping for many days. 

My reward system is beginning to heal, I'll find myself smiling as wide as I've ever smiled just noticing the gradient of the sky or the smell of the river. Riding a bicycle is an other worldly activity now. I feel so much fucking gratification and fulfillment pushing my body to its physical limits after it being in sedentary complacency for so long. This is how exercising was like before, one of the most fulfilling and enjoyable things a person can do but kratom made it bland and seem superfluous compared to my opioid zombie gaming sessions.  

I've been waking up and making a HUGE thick ass smoothie with 4 bananas, 1 cup strawberry, 1 cup blueberries, silk 20g-protein milk, 2 handfulls of kale, and 4 tablespoons of peanutbutter, which gives me so much good nutrition and energy. It's what I used to have every day for years when I was a fitness freak and my body is so used to that mix of fuel that the reward is incredible when the smoothie hits the intestines and micronutrients start reaching the brain. (Warning, next sentence is pooptalk). Also in a few days, probiotics and lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes have made my everpresent explosive diarrhea go away and now I'm mostly solid 😎
