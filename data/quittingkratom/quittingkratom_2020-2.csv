Something about Kratom really did work on my mental state. Dragged me into depression in a bad way. But I kept using it. Only when I got to my lowest did I finally decide to kick it.

I‚Äôm now over a year clean and deep in the grind of starting my business. I jumped into it full time after stopping. It consumes me. My life is immeasurably better without the stuff. I am able to experience optimism and hope. I met a high value woman I like a lot after starting to date again recently as well. She wouldn‚Äôt give me a chance back when I was using. But here we are, and I‚Äôm getting together with her again this upcoming Monday.

I‚Äôve been feeling really grateful lately, and just wanted to report back because it‚Äôs been a long while.

Change is possible, just cling onto the small piece of hope you have and take action. The rest will follow. It‚Äôs not always smooth sailing, but it‚Äôs worth it.

Here‚Äôs to forever. :)",17,0

I've gotten to the point where I'm sick of waking up feeling like shit, and feeling like shit only an hour or so after every dose. I'm having flank pain and I'm scared it's killing my kidneys. So last week I took  some time off work to withdrawal from it but it was terrible. I've been through opiate withdrawal before, nothing like this.  The akathisia is the worst part of it. The inner turmoil and not being able to sit still. Electric shocks through every extremity. Wanting to jump out of your skin. Suicidal thoughts, just wanting it to stop. The fear that this is how I'm always going to be.... Has anyone else experienced this? Will it go away with the rest of the WD? I want to be sober so bad. I'm not done trying. I'm currently tapering and then I'm going to try again but I guess it'd be nice to know I'm not the only one experiencing akathisia! Thanks!",4,0

There was a recent John Hopkins research report released (2/3/20) stating there seems to be relatively low rate of abuse potential for Kratom. The catch!

A lot of these users were found on social media and through the American Kratom Association (who we all know loves Kratom). Anyway, the results state that only 9.5% of participants had withdrawal symptoms! Ha! That is comical. I emailed the researchers and volunteered to give them my personal quitting experience.

As I said in a previous post, I strongly suggest a carnivore diet for helping with this.  If you haven't heard about it, I'm sure it sounds insane.  But it's not.

I am a little over a month without Kratom and I am at that stage where I have relapsed in the past.. The hardest part. Feeling like I cant feel pleasure without some substance to aid me with feeling good or even okay... 
For me, this is the real challenge.. Digging deep to remind myself why I am quitting and why I want to overcome this feeling of doom and general hopelessness. Maybe there is sober enjoyment out there for me, I guess I will have to find out. I started taking Kratom just before graduating high school after a bit of an opiate issue. I took it for 2 years straight, climbing up to about 30 GPD at worst. The last couple years has been off and on with this shit and I just wish I would never relapse again.. I just desperately want to feel SOMETHING. I am only 22 and my mental health is very very poor. I only wish that I made it this far without addiction, I wonder what I would have done at this point.

I split them up into 4 doses taken roughly 5-6 hrs apart. The taper was very unpleasant but not agonizing. I didn‚Äôt suffer any physical WD symptoms but my anxiety and depression still resonated everyday, some days worse than others. As my dosage lowered, I noticed that an hour after taking a dose, my anxiety would sneak in or a rush of anger. It was like clockwork. I made it down to 9.6gpd and the next day took 3 of my doses. After the third dose, that anxiety showed up like a reliable phantom. I realized maybe the K was making me moody and not the WD itself, so I said fuck it let‚Äôs just see what happens if I skip my last dose. I managed to sleep a bit last night. I was a bit restless like my skin was tingling but it wasn‚Äôt too bad. This morning I felt not terrible so I kept pushing, brought Kratom with me to work but didn‚Äôt take it. I noticed that though I wasn‚Äôt happy per say, that daily dread and anxiety was turned way down. So...I made it to 24hrs without a dose and actually feel ok.

18,2020-02-27 21:14:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/fand91/33_days_kratom_free/,33 days Kratom Free,"29/F - I had worked my way up to averaging anywhere from 30-40gpd (some days 50+) over the course of a little over 4 years. Before that I had found myself in a vicious cycle of opiate abuse, a lot of days going through 90mg roxicodone no problem. I am 130lbs and it really is scary how much of a tolerance I built to all of this. 

I decided to take the leap and say no more to Kratom 33 days ago.  I attribute majority of my success through that first week to 1200mg gabapentin daily (sometimes more was needed so I could sleep). 

I also stocked up on Magnesium, Melatonin, Epsom Salt for baths, B12, Biotin, peppermint tea, CBD gummies, and BC powder (not sure if this was good or not to use). - Oh and plenty of healthy foods - lots of veggies, fruits, protein. -And lastly, various facial moisturizers and Olaplex No.3 for the hair (suffered lots of skin and hair damage from the long term use). Seriously, the Olaplex really helps my damaged hair so much... I would definitely recommend for anyone quitting who is now wanting to undo some of the hair damage caused by Kratom (I know not everyone suffers horrible hair loss and breakage/dullness but I've seen a lot of posts where people have, and I know I most certainly did).

So I just wanna quickly describe that first week of quitting. I had gotten to a place where I had anxiety at night wondering if I was ever going to be able to do this and be free from Kratom. I had become so dependent on the stuff and I knew it was an issue. I could definitely see the physical signs my body was showing of the harmful effects it was having on me ... and yet I could not stop. I decided to do this on a whim. I had the gabapentin already around so I figured why not... let's just see how far I can get. I took my last dose on a Saturday night. I proceeded to go to work that whole next week during the toughest physical phase of quitting. Thankfully, the gabapentin did relieve I'd say 70% of the physical pain. I still had severe pins and needles, goosebumps, feelings of being freezing cold all the time, and feeling like I was in a mental fog (could have been the fact that I wasn't used to such high doses of gaba during the day). Mentally, I was definitely off that first week. I held it together the best I could. Physically in the morning, I felt so stiff and heavy like I was 90 years old. I kept taking all the pills to feel that sense of routinely taking something. It really was a struggle, even with the gabapentin. I won't downplay it. My body felt so different. I became so aware of all these aches and pains that kratom and opiates have no doubt been masking for most of the last decade of my life. This has been tough. I miss feeling so relaxed, limber, and warm like I used to after dosing. But how much kratom has financially, physically, and mentally hurt me is not worth it for me to ever go back, not even once. For me the pins and needles started to noticeably subside after week 2. After week three, my body really started to feel okay. Now at day 33, I still get dull aches and pains, but they are very tolerable. I'd like to add that I'm a long distance runner and averaged running 6 miles 3X per week, often using kratom in place of a pre workout. So, a lot of these pains are probably from cardio, which I've been very into most of my adult life. I also want to add that I wear heels 90% of the time at work, and I'm now realizing it has taken a toll on my feet so I've switched to more practical shoes. 

I struggled with anxiety a lot for the first 3 weeks. I feel better now... no depression, not too much anxiety. I see people talking a lot about PAWS, but I'm not quite sure I've noticed this in myself yet. I've struggled with intermittent depression and anxiety most of my life though, so I don't think this is something that will catch me off guard (this is another reason I think I took so strongly to the mental effects produced by opiates and kratom). 

The biggest issue I'm dealing with now is still feeling uncomfortably cold all the time, which I'm hoping will go away at some point. Also, I'm still experiencing some leg stiffness/aches, and neurological issues. I would like to start working out again this weekend, and incorporate some strength training and flexibility exercises into my routine. 

Has anyone else experienced neuropathic pain after stopping kratom use? How about the feeling of constantly being cold? Are there any supplements/vitamins you guys recommend I start adding into my life? 

I'm sorry this post is so long. I just wanted to share to encourage anyone who is struggling to quit to take the leap. Gabapentin really did help. I would definitely ask your Dr. for it as a quitting aid. I have just read from others to not take it longer than 5 days, as you can end up building tolerance quickly to it and the comedown could be potentially uncomfortable. I am still struggling, but it has only been a little over a month. I would still rather feel the way I do now over how my life was 1 month ago when I was a slave to the green sludge. Message me if you want to know anything else about my experience. Thanks to everyone posting your experiences/encouragement. I read a lot on here and truly believe it helped me to finally decide to commit to quitting. I'm so glad I did. Our bodies/minds are stronger than we give them credit for.",25,1

I typically take between 30 and 60 gpd. The easiest was following a 2 1/2 week relapse following 60 days clean.  This time, it was almost exactly the same... clean for more than 60 days with a 3 week relapse.  The results were drastically different.

The first relapse was mild.  It felt like everything came at once.  I didn‚Äôt have cold symptoms, I yawned a little bit, sleeping was lightly disturbed and I was maybe a little tired.  The worst was the anxiety, but I powered through it.  This round has sucked much more.

My sleep took a wicked hit.  I think it largely has to do with the quality and type of kratom I was taking.  The stuff I was taking (yellow vietnam) tended to make me very sleepy and even nod off.  It‚Äôs now like the inverse is happening.  The first few days royally sucked.  It wasn‚Äôt until yesterday (day 5) that things turned.  I decided not to smoke weed and instead I went to bed early.  It seemed to make a difference along with making it to day 5.  I slept a ton.  I did feel refreshed when I woke up for a little while, but then I started becoming exhausted again at work.  Finally, toward the end of my shift, I got a small boost of what I would describe as feeling normal again.

The anxiety has chilled out.  It can be pretty bad.  I find myself irritated and agitated at work.  I was already pretty burned out prior to quitting kratom.  Quitting just made it worse.  But that‚Äôs OK, I needed to quit.  I recognize what‚Äôs happening and I have a few days off next week to get straight.  It will be perfect timing.

My sleep and wellbeing has drastically improved over the past 24 hours.  I suspect by Saturday I should be in much better shape.  I believe by mid week next week this may be a distance memory.  Lots of good rest should do it.",9,0

I've been taking Kratom for two years on a daily basis up to 30-40 GPD in three or four doses. Lately extracts, lots of extracts. I'm sick of it from the expense to my gastrointestinal issues skipping meals and drinking dirt. I CT'd two days ago but I've had phamarmacuetal assistance so I haven't had an issue with many withdrawaI symptoms. I have a couple of chronic pain disorders and a bad back (and I'm freakin' old) so I wasn't looking forward to the rebound pain from quitting. For me every step and movement I make can be incredibly painful with fibromyalgia and perepheral neuropathy. The neuropathy is the worst and k helped, nevermind some euphroric effects, that I enjoyed as well as a distancing from some painful emotions. But it stopped working that way a year or more ago (except for extracts) and so here I am.

I was just wondering does anyone know how long (and I know one takes age and metabolism into account) it takes to be rid of the chemicals from k in your system? One of the most frustrating things for me is upon occasion I'm in acute pain and Kratom blocks the effects of other opiates like oxycodone and hydrocodone when I've had them prescribed and needed them.

I‚Äôm aware that some of you deeply believe that CT and prolonged suffering is the only way. Im at a critical point in my career and my back is against the wall. These are excuses that many of you have powered through, I am certain. Nonetheless, I am willing to entertain risky alternatives (obviously). 

I would like to know if anyone has successfully gotten on a LOW dose of suboxone for a month or so, and tapered. My initial thoughts would be to start at 1 MG, and get down to .5 right away (day 2) if 1 MG covers it well enough. Hang out for 3 weeks or so, start some healthy habits, let the obsession and ritual fade, let the mental symptoms from Kratom work themselves out, then use volumetric dosing to taper down to 100 micrograms or something like that. 

I really feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind on Kratom. I realize there is no silver bullet. I fully understand how risky this could be. I actually hate suboxone, but I learned a lot about the wrong way to use it before. Simply asking if anyone has any experience with a program like this. Kratom has been a different flavor of hell for me, but hell all the same. I wish everyone here peace and happiness. Thank you for any thoughtful replies!",2,0

Everything started 9 days ago when I smoked down a couple bong bowls of weed quickly and had a panic attack. I have been smoking weed since I was 18, 31 years of age now...pretty much 13 years of daily weed use, which I believe was me masking/coping with anxiety/depression/add/etc but I had never experienced a panic attack like that before. I started thinking about my kratom use and decided to kick it as maybe it had some link to it.

After seeing some posts speaking about kratom giving anxiety, it started to make more sense that I need to change my behavior. I'm also cutting off caffeine, for the most part. Sort of a total detox that I feel like my body has been BEGGING for for ages. I've been to a crisis center and talked through my problems and it seems like I need to get on an SSRI most likely. Seeing a therapist next wednesday and hopefully a psychiatrist soon after that (still need to find an opening).

It's been real rough, but I feel like I sort of crossed a hurdle going into day 4, not feeling quite as anxious although I'm nowhere where I want to be.

My main problem right now is that I wanna toke some weed, more than anything, but don't want to do anything psycho-active atm. I think down the line I may be able to return to weed but it's real hard to not give in and smoke some indica to help with sleeping/eating. I also want some of my interests to come back! Don't feel like doing much of anything. I have been reading about how working out helps a lot but I just don't have any energy, scared I will pass out if I start to run.

It makes it extremely hard to work or do anything. I try taking Advil and Tylenol but they barely make a difference. Kratom helps immensely, but I'm just stuck with all of the bullshit side effects of kratom addiction. Now I'm not in nearly as much pain, but I have extremely little energy and motivation. I know people say that quitting kratom gives you anhedonia, but it's nothing compared to being hooked on the shit.

I‚Äôve had a long struggle with OPMS kratom shots. It started off about 5 years ago, I was just taking kratom capsules. Sure enough, the capsules weren‚Äôt that strong anymore and I wanted something else. The corner store by my house started selling these kratom shots so I tried them and have been hooked on them ever since. I feel like I don‚Äôt even take kratom for the high anymore, I take it just to feel normal. I feel like I can‚Äôt even function or get anything done without it. I‚Äôm at the lowest point in my life right now. I had a great job in the military and was living in Europe. Everything changed last year when I started having severe seizures. I had an MRI done on my brain and they told me that I had a small brain tumor....a brain tumor?! I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I thought it wasn‚Äôt real because I‚Äôm so young (23 yo F). The military doctors said that since it was so small and deep in my brain, that surgery would be way too more risky than just leaving it in. However, I was seeing German doctors and they said that I absolutely needed surgery right away before the tumor grew or else I would need to go through chemotherapy within the next 5-10 years. I refused the surgery though. My seizures got worse and I had to be on seizure medications that had terrible side effects. A few months ago, the military finally medically retired me because of the tumor/seizures. I moved back in with my family and husband because I can‚Äôt be independent due to the seizures. Anyway, how does that have to do with kratom you might be thinking?? I used to only use kratom to help me get through work or to help me relax. Now I use it as more of an escape I guess, to feel numb to everything I‚Äôm going through. I always felt like kratom is that friend who is always there for you, but will end up stabbing you in the back. I want to quit but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm strong enough. I‚Äôm on day 2 CT right now because I have no money to even buy it at the moment. I feel ashamed.

My nose was a little runny yesterday, but nowhere near as bad as it used to be when I tried to CT from higher doses.

So far, the worst aspect of it has been anxiety over sleeping at night, but I have gotten between 6-8 hours of sleep every night. Overall, I‚Äôve been on an uphill trajectory since I flushed the crap. 

I know there is still a real possibility withdrawals can kick in at some point, but I am prepared if that happens with nearly every supplement that has been mentioned here. 

The ones I use regularly are CBD oil (full spectrum), agmatine, and I‚Äôll taking another supplement that has ashwanga in it. I increased my water intake and added a shake in the morning with tons of greens, berries, protein, and nut butter. I have also been keeping up with yoga, walking, and attending martial arts classes. 

So far so good! So glad to be done with this crap and am excited to put some more distance between me and the last dose.",7,0

I am on 102 days CT from Kratom (only 8 months habit). I quit vape nicotine before 1 month (with 1 slip). 

Do you think that is better to vape nicotine again? Wait to full Kratom quit recovery and then quit vape nicotine? Because I have anxiety and I think it is not beacuse of Kratom but because of quit vape.

Today I started vape again and anxiety is gone. I dont want to vape all day every day. Only limited times during day.. morning, lunch, evening.. 

Do you think that this can help with restlessness?

My  opinion is based on that dopamine system after 102 day without Kratom must be partly recovered and I dont want to burden the brain by quit nicotine which induces also its own PAWS.

So I think is better to full recover from Kratom and then think about quit nicotine - not in combination of this two WD.

I once quit for 6 months but relapsed due to boredom like an idiot....that was over 2 years ago. 
Other than that I‚Äôve quit a million other times but never made it past a week or so. 

I also quit Valium December 1st. Not by choice. I‚Äôm currently unemployed so no insurance. I‚Äôve had extreme agoraphobia for at least the last 15 years. 

So when people post about being too scared to quit, trust me I understand. I couldn‚Äôt leave the house without having constant panic attacks the first few weeks. But I can now honestly say that kratom made my anxiety SO much worse. 

I still suffer from panic attacks but they are so few and far between and don‚Äôt last nearly as long. 

Physically I feel good. Any minor symptoms, I‚Äôm able to ignore/they don‚Äôt impact my day. Most nights I sleep about 6 hours but if I have a rough night it doesn‚Äôt ruin the next day like it did say a month ago. 

PAWS are really tough this time but I should mention it‚Äôs probably so much worse because I‚Äôm home all day and have way too much time to be in my own head. Being unemployed was a blessing in the beginning but now it‚Äôs a curse. 
But even bad days aren‚Äôt THAT bad. A bad mood lasts an hour instead of the whole day. If there‚Äôs something I have to do but don‚Äôt want to, I can just do it instead of making it out to be something overly dramatic that it‚Äôs not. 

I‚Äôve been taking the following supplements that are not cure-all‚Äôs but definitely help: Black seed oil, L-Theanine, Ashwagandha, cbd, magnesium, iron (I‚Äôm very deficient) and vitamin C. 
Spend an extra couple of bucks on good magnesium citrate. When I first quit I was taking a magnesium supplement I didn‚Äôt know much about. I knew I needed it but didn‚Äôt notice it doing anything. Last week I bought a better brand (and make sure it‚Äôs citrate, your body absorbs that form the most) and it was a HUGE game changer. I feel much more calm and rested in the morning. 

The one thing to stress is that when you read posts about people who are much further along and get discouraged that they‚Äôre still experiencing symptoms - you need to know that an ‚Äúawful‚Äù day 50 is a million times better than a bad day 7 or whatever. 
I am not 100% but what I feel on my bad days is nowhere near as bad as maintaining a kratom addiction. It‚Äôs a great feeling to go about my day not having to worry if I have enough on me, when I‚Äôll dose, etc. I have no cravings at all. 

I‚Äôve saved about $1,000 in the last 50 days. Imagine how much I could‚Äôve saved if I didn‚Äôt relapse over 2 years ago. Ppphhheeewww. 

Ok, this post was just a long ramble but wanted to say something as I couldn‚Äôt dream of reaching 50 days 2 months ago.

79,2020-02-24 23:39:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/f94qp6/horrible_anxiety/,Horrible Anxiety,"I am going through a somewhat mild relapse withdrawal right now.  I‚Äôm on day 3.  I had quit for more than 60 days prior.  I‚Äôve been an off and on user for more than 2 years.  

I‚Äôve found in my mild withdrawals the mental part tends to be the hardest.  You have to sort of cope with reality once again.  Everything comes back to life.  The places where you were once hot, now have you cold.  You start noticing the little details you were ignoring before and you start to feel alive again.  Grappling with these feelings after a few weeks of not having them can really mess with you.

I keep feeling like there is some impending sense of doom.  It‚Äôs as if something is going to be taken from me.  I mostly tend to think because my work will scale back and be affected they people will look at me differently.  That my hard work will go down the drain because for a week or 2 I walk around like a zombie, doing the basics to get by each day.  I realize I can‚Äôt dwell on this.  I realize it‚Äôs beyond my control and to control what I can do... keep my head down, take care of what needs to be taken care of and the rest will be worked out.

I have a nice 5 day vacation coming up.  I will be off Tuesday afternoon, so I can take a nap and then wake up for some Super Tuesday partying.  Beer drinking with some dabs sounds like a nice way to start off the vacation.  I plan on getting back in the gym as well.

One of the things that always makes me feel better is that I can come here and vent.  I can just write how I am feeling and let it spill out into the world anonymously.  That I can be truly honest about how I feel and I just need it.  If one person reads this and even remotely relates to it then that means so much to me.  It means I am not alone and neither are they, that we may not know each other, but we are more connected than we will ever realize.

Anyways... back to the vacation.  It‚Äôs the one thing I am grinding out for... I‚Äôve been working like a madman so I don‚Äôt think anyone realizes what I am going through is due to kratom.  I think they just know I am burned out by the process.  I need a break and this vacation will be it.

The anxiety tends to come and go.  My sleep has been pretty strange.  When I first quit I slept through the first 24 hours.  Since then it‚Äôs been lots of naps.  I sleep between 2 and 3 hours here and there.  It will probably take until the weekend to really normalize.  The anxiety will probably start clearing up around then too.  Good thing I‚Äôll be in much better shape for my time off.

I just have to grind it out for the next 6 days.  After tomorrow it will be 5 and after that, 4.  Before you know I will be at 2 and then bam, I‚Äôm off and relaxing... getting healthier.

The hardest part is the initial start of your work or shift.  You‚Äôre exhausted and tired and you have to get the day going.  That initial 5 minutes sucks, but the work quickly picks up and you become busy.  The worst part is when you look at the clock and wonder how much time you have left in the shift.  That thought ruins it!

One of the best feelings though (albeit horrible idea too) is when you come home, get comfortable, eat and then nap.  That nap is always so damn good.  You‚Äôve usually been awake for 24 hours when it comes around.  You know you don‚Äôt have to be back at work for another 12-16 hours.  You wake up feeling so nice, but dreading you may have ruined your sleep for the night.  

Anyways!  I‚Äôm just rambling all my anxieties at this point.  

Message me and I‚Äôll ramble back!  Anything to keep my mind off my anxiety.

For those of you that dont remember me I quit cold turkey, threw away my stash and hunkered down in the house for a few days. It was not fun but it sure is good to not crave that shit everyday. 
I moved to kansas city from ohio and it's a lot more common out here. The other day I was in a gas station and saw a big stand of it. The shots, tablets, anyway you want to ingest it. It was the first time in a while I had that ""I want that"" feeling but I played that tape back. To the point where less than a few days later I would be back to taking it without getting any sort of a buzz at all. Just taking it to maintain. No thank you. 
Anyways stay strong. See a lot of people lately going through wd, just remind yourself its temporary and you never have to go through it again. Even when a craving hits, you still have a choice.

The first time was way, way worse. Like ER worse. They gave me valium (hadn't slept in 3 days, pounding pulse, muscle spasms, RLS), but that period of sobriety only lasted about a year. That kick, however, did leave its mark. Luckily I never became a daily user but would buy a couple ounces every now and then and binge on it. Been going on The last 3 years until 3 weeks ago.

 The other thing is that I was also dealing with an alcohol and weed problem. All three kind of influenced and enabled each other. ""I'm hungover I need some weed. Can't get weed but the headshop opens at 9 so I'll go buy an ounce of Bali. Wow feels so good. Binge on that. Wow this doesn't even feel good anymore actualy this kind of fucking blows.

Had done it once couple years ago for couple months and stopped. Tore my acl a second time picked up kratom and weed instead of pain meds cuz had previous addictions to that. So
My use was always 5 g a day did that for about 8 months every day straight then so me go a gram or two more here and there and then  decided it was to much cut back to about three times a week and been there for over a year now. Now occasionally one those days I‚Äôll take more then 5 g but I‚Äôve never take more then 9g in one day. So I would say over the last 6 months or so
My hair as thinned like crazy yea I know I‚Äôm 29 but no mpb in majority of my family my dad died at 44 with a full head of still thick hair. I looked back at pics from like year ago and you can see the difference in thickness. My hair line has receded a tiny bit but that‚Äôs from age I can live with that if it was mpb I think would be a more pronounced widows peak. The thinning was almost of shedding like I would run my hands through my hair and like 15 20 hairs would just start falling out and I could just do it basically over and over. Now I do it I get a couple and that‚Äôs only a week off so I def think the Kratom. Withdraw been minimally I just have Anhedonia pretty bad so guess asking how long till hair bounces back and Anhedonia subsides a little thank you !",3,0

Does anyone else have an obsession with QT? I am so focused on quitting that it has become an addiction. Wondering if that is healthy as I try to stay off of social media in general. I just got rid of Facebook for so many reasons but what a huge waste of time. This doesn‚Äôt feel like a waste of time because it is so important to quit and have support. 

51 days today and still coming up against road blocks but using kratom is not going to happen. My hatred for it is way too strong at this point. I don‚Äôt even want to associate with anyone I know who has anything to do with it- even if they don‚Äôt ingest it. It‚Äôs not a matter of thinking I‚Äôll use but how they do not get the gravity and of its dangers. I can‚Äôt speak to anyone who doesn‚Äôt get that at the moment. 

I‚Äôm so glad I am well on the way to being free 100% but am still cross with myself for even doing it for so long. This too will pass and is part of the process!

First of all I‚Äôm only 8 days clean. So I can‚Äôt speak to paws or other acute long-term withdrawal symptoms... I don‚Äôt mean to take away from anything anyone is feeling! 

But that said, it does -feel- to me that there‚Äôs a tendency to tag kratom withdrawals with any ill-feelings that might pop up in life, particularly when we‚Äôre looking at people that are 9+ months clear.

How do you differentiate just having a bad day from
PAWS? There‚Äôs no getting around it - we all have good and bad days mentality. Life is a roller coaster... And it seems dangerous to me to always point to an issue we might be having as some sort of long term symptom. Even before you took this stuff, you (probably!) had good days and then you had days where you were blue... You had anxiety filled ones, and you had nice, relaxing ones. 

I feel like there‚Äôs a danger there in not confronting the real life issue, and instead just ignoring it as a temporary symptom. I feel like if life is getting you down or you‚Äôre fighting anxiety it‚Äôs almost too easy to just tag it as a symptom and wait for it to pass. But you‚Äôre not helping yourself... And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs aways just the withdrawals getting better... Sometimes it‚Äôs just life moving on and new things happening. 

I‚Äôm not sure what my point is... I guess I just want everyone to be careful and not bury their problems behind an idea of long-term kratom suffering... At some point this stuff is out of our system, and we have to start battling the issues that bring us down and keep us from being our best selves... 

I don‚Äôt doubt there are longer term problems and issues that can arise... I just think it‚Äôs an easy trap to blame every low feeling on this...",5,0

98,2020-02-24 09:35:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/f8s2l0/hello/,Hello,"So I've been lurking for a few hours.  I started taking kratom about a year ago as an alternative to narcotic pain meds. I have very chronic kidney stones, and as a result of those I developed a serious addiction to pain killers, which escalated to full blown heroin use. 

I have been clean from heroin for 7 years. I have had to take opiates since due to kidney stones, but I would only take them for a few days and only when I was severe pain.  I never entered back into active addiction or dependence on them. 

Last year i had to have 4 surgeries for obstructing kidney stones. I was in constant severe pain in my flank and pelvic area(like glass in my bladder). I was concerned about the amount of norco I was needing. I get tolerant very quickly.  So my doctor sent me to an addiction specailist who started giving me suboxone(as an alternative to pain killers). 

This was a bad idea. Not only did I get dependent, but I almost died during surgery because of the amount of drugs they had to give me to break through the suboxone. I would not have even known this happened, except they knocked one of my teeth out, broke two other back teeth and messed up my jaw emergency intubating me. It also stopped helping with pain, and I didnt want to take more than 8mg.  

So CTed off the suboxone. It was pretty aweful. 

My primary wanted me to go to a pain clinic. I heard about kratom, figures if it worked I'd rather do that.  And it has been working.  I really was amazed that it touched the pain I get from these stones at all. 

Of course I got tolerant and needed to up my dose. It was a trial and error thing.  Right now, I've been taking 36gpd, it's been at this amount for 9 months. 

My stones are still an issue and I will need to have a partail nephrectomy(the bottom part of my kidney has to go).  But I have been wanting to get off this kratom. It's expensive and i feel crappy. I take capsules....the powder just makes me puke. My issue is, I've become pretty attached to it.  Even still, I cannot say I regret going this route because opiate pain killers completely destroyed my life.  It kinda feels like a no win situation sometimes. 

I am not really freaked out about withdrawals. I have noticed that with kratom, the agitation is crazy. I get really easily angered, really sore and my anxiety gets pretty bad. I would plow through this....except that I have three kids. Two teens and a toddler....so for the sake of my household, I gotta taper.  My husband works a lot so he cannot help me during the day.  When I CTed off the suboxone my husband took his vacation days and held down the fort while I went through my business.  That's not an option now. 

I'm thinking I'll slash my dose to 25gpd, take motrin and taper from there starting today.  I can deal with being uncomfortable.  I have never withdrew from this stuff all the way yet so reading all this is very helpful.  I'm functioning very well, so it hasnt gotten to a point where I cannot live my life. I do space out easier and lose my sense of the passage of time(no clue if I said that right)  I just wanna be off it. I hate feeling like I have to take something and needing to make sure I have kratom money I'd rather be spending on other stuff, and the foggy head feeling i get sometimes is miserable.

Granted, I'll be taking whatever pain medication they give me for the next month or so, but without the day-to-day pain that has made quitting so awful.  I want to be a better person than I've been.  

I'm scared.  I'm scared that something will go wrong during or after the surgery, leaving me in a catatonic state, or worse.  My surgeon is one of the best in the nation, and I've talked with others who have had the same surgery with this doctor, and they have nothing to say but positive things.  But we are all different, and the idea of hurting even more after this long stretch of pain is scary, even if it's supposedly the ""good kind of pain"".

Every decision and action I take should now be lived for my family and others.  I need to stop my self-pity, as life can be so much better than this.   I want to take my kid to places I've always dreamed of.  I want to be free of the limitations that K implied.  I want to take each and every one of you and hug you for the heartfelt sharing on this sub, as it's made my journey thousands of times more tolerable.

You guys are a true blessing, and for those in the thick of withdrawal, I know that pain well, and I've used it as my example as to how all things are finite, even pain and depression.  We will all beat this together and find the life we deserve on the other side of this addiction.

I was wondering if there are common characteristics of people who get addicted to K.  

Part of my wondering is because I got exposed to it for the first time in a pretty random way.  I think I‚Äôm older than most here (50+) and my wilder days are behind me.  Is Kratom a common part of the general drughead scene (booze, pot, coke, hallucinogens, pills ) these 
days? 

Here is me- does this connect at all with others out there:

Past history of substance abuse.  Got sober in 2002- booze and pills. Did AA pretty heavy until 2011 or so.  Like many idiots floated away from the fellowship. 

Kratom specifically was dangerous for me because- 

It‚Äôs legal- I simply don‚Äôt have the kind of life these days where I have the contacts, or the time, to get illegal substances. An arrest would have huge consequences. I got mail order and figured out the best head shop buys.   My job involves driving around a large city and I have (counting now) 6 places I could stop- one maybe ten minutes from my house. 

The damage is insidious.  At my max I was probably at 40-50 gpd.  I still functioned.  Hard to compare but what would be the equivalent drunk- 15 drinks? Shit, I would get high and scrub the kitchen.   I have had two instances where I was so incapacitated it would have been obvious.  Both times I was doing the extract shots that had other substances. My point is that I have to function- job, family etc.  Kratom is such that it didn‚Äôt have immediate impact- I didn‚Äôt stumble into work bombed or OD in the basement.  But the damage accumulated.  I have a long road to go both physically and to out together my life. 

I have chronic physical and mental illness that the high of Kratom ‚Äúmade better‚Äù.  It‚Äôs a powerful stimulant (depression) and analgesic (chronic pain).  

It‚Äôs helpful for me to take a look at my own behavior.  Just like with any addiction my behavior while using is astounding to me. I‚Äôm especially angry at myself for throwing away the insights and gifts AA gave me, but there is no upside to me beating myself up.  I gotta get back in the fellowship and build a sober life again 

If anyone is reading and is playing around with K please stop.   It‚Äôs a serious drug- don‚Äôt let its status fool you.",8,0

Which is surprising given that past attempts had been utter failures and my emotional state and physical pain levels yesterday were worse than usual. In the past I've always had serious cravings that I had to drown out with alcohol or kava and I've never made it past 1 day. Yesterday I was pretty okay sober and I intend to keep that up today. I think, hopefully, that I've finally hit that point of ""knowing"" I'm done. I'm ready to move on. My wife left me, I've got my first new band in 6 years, and am applying to med school this cycle. Might as well embrace all the change at once rather than dragging it out in stages.

There is the slightly depressing realization that some of the stuff I was masking with kratom is still there. I thought I would be more productive sober but I didn't do shit yesterday except pace in circles around my house. This is one of the reasons I picked kratom up in the first place. Because it got me to sit my ass down and focus on what I needed to do. Just gotta work on my discipline though.",2,1

It's cheaper and easier to get off of.,"I could do meth during the acute phase of the withdrawals and speed up my metabolism to get the shit out of my system faster. Meth keeps me busy which keeps my mind off throwing Kratom pills in my mouth. I'm currently on a taper from about 70 pills a day on the worst days. This is just a thought. I don't plan to go back to meth. I've been through Kratom withdrawals before in November 2018. I literally have PTSD from them I think. Seriously considering rehab but withdrawals are withdrawals and NOTHING helps. No medication, nothing. It's just God's way of instilling me never to go back to it again. I was stupid to go back to this shit. Been on it for a year now.",0,0

**Its time to not cry here**, but post something what can help someone who searching for HELP! Something useful.. and sorry for my english.. 

I had some BAD! PAWS episodes last week and this PAWS induced after bad nights. So..¬†

**1) The key is sleep!**

I think **the main key is sleep**. You need to sleep to heal your brain. It means if you wake up in the middle of the night, **don't touch your phone, don't look at clock till you alarm is not ringing**. **Don't wear smart band or any clock** \- you don't need to analyze you sleep quality. Just **lay in bed and try anything to sleep**. Try to not move - I know it is¬†challenge, but play the game! Level 1 - do not move for 60 second.. fail.. ok, Level 1 again.. , try it again and again, Level 2 not move for 2 minutes (count to 120).. fail? Let's try again. **I magine positive things**, pray, meditate, **say STOP**, empty your brain, calm your mind, take Valerian root and Ltheanin again and try to sleep. **Each minute is important, to accumulate energy for next day and brain healing proces.**¬†

My habit is go to bed at 9-10pm, then I have lot off time to sleep even if I wake up multiple time at night. **Main target is sleep minimal 6-7 hours** even if it should be intermittent. More is better.

**2) Minimalize suplements to maximize natural heal**

I am cutting supplements to absolute minimal regimen. I need to heal brain faster, but it can be hardest way. I think not essencial self medicated supplements can help but.. also can case chemical inbalance and we know.. each person is different. **Brain natural ability to heal is faster way out.. but It gets more pain.. Psychological pain!**¬†

* **Morning**: vitamins C + B + multy + Omega 3 + raw quality caccao - all before or with food.   
Important! .. take good probiotic (Protexin Bio-Kult)¬†
* **Lunch**: vitamins C + B
* **Afternoon** : Excercise Hiit (15-20 min), probiotic¬†
* **Before bed**: vitamin C + B + multy, Magnesium (L-theanin and valerian root extract, if you cant sleep - not regulary)

**3) Use second brain to produce dopamine and serotonine**

Force to eat healty, because stomach and intestines together are our second brain. Balanced digestion and  nourishing bacteria is key to produce more dopamine and serotonine. Also has big impact on your mood and how you feel! And what is healty eating exactly?

***Try to make smoothies -*** is better than anything, because it can be drinked (I know how eating is hard sometimes) example: morning smoothie.. caccao, tangerine, avocado, oat-flakes, C vitamine, B vitamine, honey, banana

***Eat varied diet*** \- we have lot of bacterias in stomach and intestines. Each one wants something different. If you balance your food, you also balance your mood and boost production of hormones.

***Use quality probiotic*** \- get some quality probiotics. I use this one .. [https://www.bio-kult.com/aboutbio-kult](https://www.bio-kult.com/aboutbio-kult)

***Force to eat*** \- Try to eat minimal 3 meals per day / or smoothies per day. 

**Avoid sugar and fast food** \- sugar stimulates you, but it is nothing good in WD stage. Try to find sacharides in natural form: fruits, honey. Do not eat cakes or fast food. Especialy fast food caused me panic attacks, because some kinds of this ""food"" destroys the environment in the stomach and intestines.

**4) Battle with anxiety and depression (my personal tips)**

Rememer that what you feeling and how you perceive things is only ilusion! **It is NOT YOU! It will never be the same as is in this moment!** Don't make important decisions.

* **Dont think about past or future**, think only about now.. and that it will go away!
* **Imagine that now brain is healing**.. opioid receptors created from Kratom are dying, it hurts but it is something like fever when you are ill and it is healing process. ¬†
* **Learn to set your mind** to positive thoughts -¬†say STOP world in your head, to stop anxiety and set mind to anything positive. Not working? Say it again! And again!¬†Imagine that you will be okay. Imagine what you will do after this passes.
* **Learn to count breathing** 1,2,3,4,5,6 and repeat, concentrate to breathing to set mind from fear. Think and remember good days to your mind.¬†
* **Practice box breathing** 5+5+5+5 (acute help) practice anywhere anytime. Imagine that positive energy is going in and stress I going out. It will destroy your anxiety.¬†
* **Use L-theanin, Valerian root** to calm your mind.¬†
* Wim hoff breathing
* **Excercise** \- pump hearth rate to 149bpm for some minutes
* **Sauna with cold bath** (Hot bath with cold shower at home)
* Morning cold shower
* **Mindfulness meditation** to get up stress.¬†

**And.. How¬† how I feel now on Mark 100 ?**¬†

No Kratom (100 days), No caffeine (84 days), No nicotine vape (37 days), No alcohol (4 days).

**The bad:** Last days.. Some days.. was kick me in hell. Depersonalization, derealization, anxiety, depression.. It starts right after bad sleep and it usually ends after 12-24 hours.

**The good:** I have baseline days. Half day or all of day! They come after good night sleep! This is why I think that good sleep is the key to heal and feel good.

***Yesterday I was anxiety from 10am to 6pm. Today it si okay - I feel like 90% myself.  I believe that my baseline will continue for some days .. ideal for weeks! I believe it will be OK for longer time!***¬†

I know, PAWS are not linear, so I am prepared to fight again and again! 

**Stay strong,  turn to God and pray! I will pray about all of you! You can do it!**

This topic is for all of you and also for me..when PAWS hits me again!",15,0

I basically use kratom because I like the way it makes me feel. Ten years ago, I was addicted to heroin, but abruptly quit by joining the military (yes, it was just as horrible as it sounds. Would not recommend, but I made it.) 

I‚Äôve been using it every single day for the last year. I haven‚Äôt even tried to quit. I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs going to feel like how it felt when I quit heroin, minus the drill sergeants yelling in my face as I‚Äôm literally diarrhea-ing my pants.

I know that something that makes me feel so good all the time HAS to be bad for me, and I want to quit now before several years and thousands more dollars are wasted. My girlfriend (she doesn‚Äôt use kratom, and doesn‚Äôt love that I do) and I are on month two of a 90 day clean eating/no drinking/lots of exercise journey, and it‚Äôs going quite well. But while she‚Äôs having a hard time trying to stay away from booze, I feel like a fraud saying I‚Äôm living clean, as I‚Äôm high literally every single day. 

I don‚Äôt know what I expect from this post, but I would love to hear some success stories, personal anecdotes about what it felt like to quit, and for someone to tell me that everything is going to be okay. I feel like I‚Äôm not super excited to quit, but at the same time, I really really want to take control over my life. Can any of you guys help me to motivate?

I really, really need help","I've always believed that kratom made me a better person, and I am very harshly realizing it is the exact opposite. Kratom is severely damaging my life, my relationships, and my endeavors.

I've been to rehab twice for my addiction. I have managed to be sober for 4 months but then I couldn't get off gabapentin. I tried it this last time out of compulsion and then got stuck in the cycle again. I know for sure I can't touch this stuff anymore. It gives me weird side effects like sweating A LOT and shakiness. People can tell when I am on it.

I feel like its impossible to stop. I don't have the same energy. I don't have the same willpower sober as I do when I'm on kratom. Without it I honestly feel no interest in anything. Right now I'm collecting unemployment and doing side gigs for extra income. Like this I'm able to afford major expenses like rent while sustaining my habit. No savings. 3,000 credit card debt which is very late. I live paycheck to paycheck

So far I have managed to taper down to only 2 doses a day, 6g once in the morning, go work, go to gym, come home, dose another 6g as I wind down and go to bed. I've been stuck like this for the past month or so. It feels like this is close to the lowest I can go. The problem is not at all emotional either, I just cannot stand the discomfort that comes with Kratom withdrawals. My body actually wakes me up earlier than I want to because at around 8am I start to feel shaky and extremely extremely uncomfortable. Like can't sit still even for a milisecond kind of antsy and honestly it feels like hell to me. To my brain right now kratom is the only way to feel ""comfortable"". Without it I get extremely antsy and uncomfortable physically. I even have plenty of comfort meds like gabapentin, soma, and I have even recently found that marijuana is a HUGE help for me if that means anything. It calms my body quite a bit but I still feel like none of this is enough.

I've experienced this struggle too many times to do this anymore. I've never felt so certain this time that I am absolutely done. Its honestly a pathetic and embarrassing addiction to have. It also tastes awful and fuck up my stomach. I just wish there was a way I can knock myself out for 2 days straight while I detox this shit out of me so I don't have to feel anything. I was thinking about going to detox, but honestly I am done with after treatment because many institutions push NA/AA stuff and I am more on the side of SMART recovery. I have gone the detox route before but I feel like making this much less complicated and cold turkey on my own. There HAS to be a way I can do it on my own. I just don't know the proper steps.

Longest I have made it is 4 days and my mind was so foggy I used some for a business event and then went back to my normal dose. Today is day 2 and I feel like shit. I set things up to be broke and overpaid my bills and filled my gas tank so I could not go to the store and buy more. I had a moment of weakness an hour ago and thought I would look for some in my closet where I would hide it from my girlfriend. I broke down in tears bc I found (literally) hundreds of the little brown bags that the smoke shop sells that shit in. I did find a couple grams and after staring at it for 5 minutes I flushed it. I think I will be ok this time bc I know what to expect by lurking these threads. I do operate so much better on Kratom but its just........not me, its the drug and that depresses me. I have not used any other drugs or drank since I first tried Kratom but it has become its own monster. My bones feel like they are splitting out of my skin and my anxiety is through the roof. Luckily I have some Seroquel that is given to me to treat my insomnia so I'm still able to rest. The last time I quit I did not sleep for more than 2 hours a night for the entire 4 days. Wish me luck and send a prayer my way. I really need to do this for my family. I have the perfect life, a beautiful family and a wonderful home. Kratom has put that all in jeopardy and no one knows it but me. Thank you all for posting your experiences, when I try to talk to people about it they are like, ""Its a fucking plant bro, you can't get withdrawals from that its natural"" I know they are wrong but don't have the energy to argue.

I've tried quitting 3 times, never lasted more than 24 hours. Tomorrow I will have been clean for a week. 

The days since I stopped have been surprisingly easy, the only real withdrawal symptom being lethargy. 

Now, the first times I tried stopping, I was taking larger doses of primarily white & green vein, and from a different vendor, whose kratom was noticably stronger than my most recent vendor. Initially this was of course a bummer because not only was my tolerance rising, but I also now had weaker kratom. 

Due to kratom being increasingly difficult to get a hold of where I live, I've been making it last by taking smaller doses from my dwindling stash, which now only consisted of red strains which I would cut with stem & vein to make them last longer. Initially I had no plans of quitting, but had a talk with a friend who convinced me to go the day without dosing. Around the normal time of my dose and for a few hours after I felt restless and a little irritable, after that I started feeling better, more like myself. My friend noted that I looked more relaxed and had a more grounded, peaceful air about me. That evening I did dose half a teaspoon due to being unable to sleep, but since then I've been clean without much issue, other than lower evenergy and libido. 

Now I found this quite odd, I'm happy and feeling great of course, but I never thought it would be this easy.

Then I saw a video on youtube where a guy talks about how the strain in question may have quite a considerable effect on withdrawal symptoms. He said that especially Maeng Da, Vietnamese kratom and the stronger white veins were the ones that produced the strongest withdrawal symptoms. 

This was in sync with what I'd experienced. I'd been only using red strains cut with stem & vein for months, and when I stopped, no problems. Two years ago I was on up to 30g of mainly white & green veins per day, and didn't even last a day without heavy emotional problems, Restless Leg Syndrome and insomnia.

This may not be the case for all folks of course, but I couldn't find another post about this, so thought I'd put it out there.",4,0

I have read through some stories, just now, and ive always felt this never effected me poorly, as it was controlled use, and not ruining my bank, till i saw the anger coming out... now im reading this stories of how much life changed for people. all i wanted to change was the snappy attitude. today i was up alot, cooking, kinda doing a bit more. i am really hoping this lights me on fire again, im a passionate person, but i feel kratom has me kinda numb.

But it seems the vast majority of these people have only only stopped taking kratom for approx 3-4 days before restarting to use again. I was one of those people. And yes, its true, the physical symptoms do subside somewhat (def not all the way) around Day 3 or 4 for most. Enough to make you feel as though you've made it through. But that appears to be only half the battle, and the comparatively easier one. At Day 4 or 5 is when the ""other"" symptoms kick in, and for me these are much harder to deal with. The agonizing depression, the crippling lethargy, the doom and gloom of hopelessness and despair - and all that kinda stuff. I think this is Part 2 of why so many restart around this time. They feel accomplished, like they can handle it if they do decide to stop, yet also mentally unwell. So one really thinks ""it helps me feel better and I could stop again without too much trouble - Why not?!"" Reading all the stories here on quittingkratom at least makes me feel like it's not just me. It's very hard. I'm trying but I'm taking it literally minute by minute, talking myself out of taking just one dose and reminding myself that it will truly only make me feel happy for an hour or 2 tops. I'm sick of the roller coaster ride of all day dosing and waking up feeling like crap every day - but damn! It's tougher and longer than I thought it would be.",63,0

Instantly threw up all over my toilet but eventually I learned to keep it down in teas or smoothies which were not much better. My usage slowly increased from 2grams x2 a week in January  to 12 grams daily that summer to using 2-3 oz a day! 


I was 15 when I started using heavily 2-3 oz and even at those doses I still saw it as beneficial to me for depression/anxiety but that much did have a effect on my stomach and my life revolves around my doses. I would have my parents drive me home first many times and go out of their way to get my ‚Äústuff‚Äù and I would dose and go but I would usually bring my doses but you know how things come up out of no where. 

But I was able to quit cold turkey during the 2017 ban scare because I was very scared but I also started doing Xanax and marijuana when I was 17 which I abused heavily for a few months but the market got flooded with pressed chalk bars I just quit but still smoked daily with some breaks occasionally I did LSD when I was 18 and used it almost weekly all of the winter that year also lots of MDMA (I love to candy flip and smoke weed!)always good rocks twice a month (I know way too often) that winter and weed multiple times a day.

Now I‚Äôm 19 almost 20 and have done nothing with my life and hate myself things could have been so different. I want to start with the Kratom because it makes me numb and while that was beneficial when I was younger at my house now it is not needed. I hate being tied to a fucking plant like Kratom that now is everywhere and causes withdrawal. 


I made this (/rant/life story) to keep me acountable this time I say it helps at my labor job but that‚Äôs bullshit and a crutch. I have adderall and klonopin and weed and CBD and a few grams of mushrooms (doubt I‚Äôll use them) to get me through the worst of it.

145,2020-02-21 15:07:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/f7gsmh/its_been_awhile_relapsedquit_again/,It's been awhile (Relapsed/Quit Again!),"Haven't been here in almost a year, so I'm not sure if there's anyone around who may remember me. Anyway, long story short I quit a 2-year 12g a day habit back in September 2018. I was clean from kratom for 7 or 8 months, until one day I was sick and achy and felt awful and of course convinced myself it would be OK and I was mature enough to handle it. 

And I was, for awhile, through the spring and summer. I'd never take it more than a few days in a row, would take weeks/month breaks, etc. etc. In the fall, I moved to a new city where I knew no one, I didn't have a new therapist yet, and my depression got extremely bad, so I fell into using much more frequently (going for like a week in a row, then taking a few day break to make sure I never got physically addicted). Eventually, I was feeling so bad that I fell back into daily use at the end of november. In december I started on antidepressants and really started feeling better in january when my dosage was upped. At that point I knew I had to (and wanted to) quit again, but I had a trip planned at the end of january and ended up prolonging it cuz I didn't wanna WD while out of town.

Anyway, I quit again 10 days ago after around 2 months of around 12-16g daily use. It wasn't too bad this time‚Äîabout three days of physical symptoms, three days of horrid anxiety, and then the past few days I've felt nearly 100% mentally except for I've had some bad insomnia, which I don't really remember having other than during the physical symptoms last time. Regardless, quitting from 2 mo daily use (and for the second time) was smooth sailing compared to 2 years daily use. The hardest thing is changing my brain's habit of ""waiting for dosing time,"" which should mostly dissipate over the next few weeks. But I've been able to keep myself busy so far so it hasn't been too bad.

So, for anyone in a similar situation as me, just wanted to share a few tldrs:

1. If you relapse, chances are, you might be fine with occasional use for awhile. But the chances are even greater that you will slowly fall back into daily use.
2. Don't feel like it's the end of the world if you've relapsed to daily use and been on it for a couple weeks or months. Quit now! I promise you it'll be SO MUCH easier than quitting a year+ habit, and the longer you stay on it the worse the WD/PAWS will get.
3. Therapy, psychiatry, etc are vital for those of us with mental health issues :). If you don't think you can pay for such things, please PM me as I have resources I've used before and can vouch for.

Good luck and well wishes to you all!",1,0

Less than 10gpd, and not every day. Eventually it got worse and worse. Taking it the moment I woke up, and all day long. Started taking it to work with me. Eventually I was taking 60+ gpd, in 7+ gram doses.

At one point I ran out before my next order came in, and the WD, that I never knew would happen, hit me. Couldn't sleep for 2.5 days, even after taking sleeping pills. Horrible anxiety and extreme restless limbs.

That's when I knew it was a problem. It took me almost a year to get the nerve to plan to quit. I did lots of research. Ordered any and every supplement that could help. Planned out a 6 week taper to align when I had a week off work.  

My initial drop was from 60+gpd to 25gpd to start my taper, and then lowered on average 1gram every other day, give or take. That was a mistake, as the initial drop kicked my ass physically and emotionally. I felt like I was wearing a led vest and it would take me up to an hour to get out of bed, sometimes having to just roll off.

My emotions were fucking and I was feeling depressed, but also enraged at the smallest thing. It scared me. I felt so out of it, and disconnected from reality. 

Insomnia wasn't an issue with the taper, but I was lucky to get 3 hours of sleep a night for over a month, and would wake up drenched in swear, having to peel my top off.

I ended up pushing someone away that I cared about a lot. Kratom cost me that. I tried so hard to avoid it, but I couldn't and things couldn't be  fixed. I underestimated the impact of PAWS in that case.

I realized a lot of things about myself that I needed to fix. In particular how incredibly insecure I was. No self esteem, no self confidence. Too easily rattled. It is something I have been working on over the last year and I feel like a new person. I am much more disciplined, exercising nearly every day and I am in the best shape of my life at 37. What has helped a lot was listening to, and reading a book by David Goggins.

It was pure hell, and I will never let myself forget it and think I can handle a little bit. You all must know that there is light on the other side of the tunnel. It will suck before it gets better, but it will get better.",13,0

I had quit for 30 days and had past all of the rls, the aches, the pains, the depression, sleepless nights, all of it! Was back to work feeling good. Hitting the gym, trying to make a come back. I even got a new job offer that was a dream come true that i couldnt refuse. But i suddenly became overwhelmed with too much work. Im a food vendor and have a sales route that eats up 60hrs per week plus my new job liquidating estates and selling antiques. It was after i got my new job that i was becoming super overwhelmed with work and managing my life with my girlfriend. I know staying busy is a good thing but im a god dam workaholic. Im actually an everythingholic! Im sure you get the idea.... so one night i was bringing a bunch of merchandise to my house to list online and i was so tired, i thought maybe a small pack of kratom caps would get me through this work. I got the smallest bag i could buy and tried using it sparingly to help with my anxiety and sure enough i got through it and made an amazing sale! After i finished the bag over the course of 2 days, i tried to put it down.... but we all know how that goes?!? Just the thought of not having anymore was driving me crazy. And the crazier thing was is that i had been through HELL quiting the last time. But i broke down, went go to store again to buy another small bag. Only this time, they sold out of small bags and only had huge bags. I almost walked out knowing that was too much, but you know i bought it anyway.. 2 weeks straight i abused it just like the old days, 50gpd like a moron. All of my joy and feeling went numb again. Me and my girlfriend were having great sex again and now i want nothing. She is getting pissed. Shes knows something is wrong but has no idea what im doing. So the good news out of all of this is that I stopped after a 2 and half week binge. The bad news is that all the terrible withdrawl symptoms are back again. I really dont think its possible to hate myself anymore than now. Im on day 3 ct now and im super stressed. My new boss is counting on me to make money for our new client and havent done shit in 3 days. I cant screw this job up! Ive been buying and selling antiques half my life and now im working with one of the top liquidators in the area. Im also letting my girlfriend down too. My sex drive is in the toilet.... im just keeping my fingers crossed that i can keep this sobriety up for longer than 30 days this time.

My outlook on life is already starting to improve.  I still have cravings but I just remind myself of how kratom effected me negatively and why I want to quit.

I‚Äôve quit many substances in the past, and I don‚Äôt want kratom to be the one thing holding me back from being my most authentic self.

On the plus side, I think that interacting with other people while using kratom is super weird.

last monday, i took what i hope to be my final dose of kratom. i'd tried to taper before, but i didn't have the self-control. i've lurked on this sub periodically, both in the past couple months, and when i was in this boat 2 years ago. i've been an on-off addict for a long time; i used a lot of prescription meds but always returned to kratom. i feel like it's my achilles heel (i even had a kratom induced seizure once, which you think would make me stop.) after relapsing on a cocktail of meds, i got off with kratom. and then got back on. i've never been able to successfully use any drug by itself before. i had 2 years sober, and was an active member of AA before going back out. at the end i probably averaged 20-30 gpd. the last time i used it my college campus was covered in fog. it felt like a womb. i've been fortunate with k w/ds before; the past 2.5 days have been quite rough. i can get over the flu-like symptoms (supplements and forcing myself to exercise have helped), but the sadness/remorse/regret follow me like a stray. at times things have been comedically bad; my grandfather died last night. the last time i saw him i was continually high. i don't really remember it. most of what i was using were his expired meds. the funeral is next week and i'm thinking of ways to avoid the rooms in his home which contain expired meds. 

i am fortunate to have gotten out of this, and very lucky that kratom isn't available to me within my community. i hope this post doesn't come across as whiny or melodramatic. today was better than the last two days, and my SO has been unbelievably supportive. for a long time, i was a functioning addict. i go to a selective liberal arts school, and carried on a deeply debased inner life while thriving academically for two years before it finally, fully caught up to me. i left, got sober, and came back. here we are. i've tried to take a cue from the stoics in the past two days, and focus on what's in my control. i can't change how my body is feeling, or, frequently, how my emotional state corresponds. what i control are the ways in which i respond to and think about my predicament; the only way is forward. right now i'm taking it hour by hour.",2,0

Unfortunately, I work in an industry that makes cannabis not an option... and I've admittedly had problems with alcohol in the past--and that's just a road that was going to lead me to incarceration or death.

It was about two years ago that I first gave kratom a try, and it was great!  My stress and anxiety slipped away and it also gave me the slightest hint of energy and euphoria.  I'd taken some time off work just to mellow out a bit, and that's when it really started.  (Interestingly, my last drink was about 2 years ago this month when I was first introduced to kratom, so there's that.)

Kratom worked for me because it kept the stress at bay but didn't leave me in a state where I was useless (like the booze did.)  I was still productive while managing my anxiety.  However, I'm careless and obviously have dodgy self-control abilities given my past problems with alcohol.  I started with a scale, measuring carefully, tracking dosages but eventually just started dosing when I felt I needed to.  That obviously escalated.

Should have seen the warning sign near the end of that first sabbatical from work when I ran out of the kratom I'd bought and hit the withdrawal wall pretty hard--like a dumbass I just suffered through a couple of days of what felt like the worst flu ever until another order came through.

Ever since then I've always had a kilo in the house, and like I mentioned before I wasn't really measuring.  I'd just dose with about a level teaspoon when it felt like time and I never did a good job tracking my doses.  Best guess is maybe I got up to 24-40mg a day--which may not be a lot compared to others--but it was definitely inhibiting me in a different way than alcohol did.  Sure, I was still working (and honestly kicking ass at work) but literally doing \*nothing\* else.  Zero motivation to do anything outside of the things I absolutely had to do.  Realized I'd kinda wasted two years of my life here, and I could no longer act like kratom hadn't become a problem.

So after the last kilo of ""good"" kratom ran out, I decided it was time to stop, nearly two years to the day after I started.  I read the supplement list here and ordered all that shit--no idea if it is gonna help, but anything is worth a try.  I still had the smallest remainder of an old bag of a really shitty strain from a vendor who wasn't my regular vendor--might be a fucking bag of dirt for all I know--but I portioned out tiny about .5mg doses into little paper sleeves.  I keep close count of those and will take .5mg when the withdrawal starts hitting really hard.  So, I abruptly went from 25+ mg a day of a potent strain to <5mg of dried turd powder a day... that was a couple of really tough days but now it's working for me.  I honestly think that might be in my head more than anything.  That was always how I dosed, a pretty hefty portion (maybe 2mg) in little paper sleeves like a headache powder that I'd hit whenever the ""need"" arose.  

Sorry, this is getting too long, I just want to thank everyone here for sharing their stories... this is obviously a throwaway and I've never talked about this to anyone, and no one would ever guess that I'm dealing with this.  I'm going to continue to taper down from where I am now until I'm done.  I'm starting to feel human again, the toughest part for me is getting good sleep... the sleep I got while using was actually the very first thing that attracted me to kratom now that I think about it.

Anyway best of luck to all of you as you go on whichever path you choose.",2,0

It was a slow taper that for the most part went smoothly.  The most difficult thing aside from maintaining daily dose discipline over a 4 month period was managing my emotions as my daily dropped.  When my emotions began to bubble up they would trickle sometimes and burst out other times.  It really took a lot to manage them in stressful situations with family and work.  Once I realized what was happening I was able to put some protocols in place to manage them closely.  I also became severely empathetic which has not dissipated (not a negative when self aware).  There were many improvements to my mental and physical well being that began to manifest before I was even half way through the taper.

The biggest blessing was the return of my spontaneous nature.  I never realized that it had disappeared after the first year of using kratom (I used 4-5 years, no breaks).  My life became dominated by rigid routines that I actually prided myself in keeping.  It evolved more or less into selfish pursuits that I can imagine were annoying to those around me at home and work.  I never wanted to do anything out of the ordinary and was quick to bring up all the things that could possibly go wrong with the suggestions of others.  The only thing that I was spontaneous about was shoveling green powder down my throat.

As I became more self aware, I began to shed these routines.  One of them was cutting my own hair.  I kept it short and cut it ever 2 weeks.  I have not cut it since June and grew a beard.  This action was very symbolic of shedding kratom, as well as the mentality that it's use saddled me with.  I look in the mirror and see a different person.  I feel like a different person.

Today I am happy to drop what I'm doing and participate in last minute family outings with the wife and kids.  I take on new projects at work without complaint or hesitation (in most cases, lol).  I no longer need to scramble up a baggie of kratom to take along and stress about how I will detach to dose.  I don't have to worry about where the money for my next 1/2 kilo is coming from.  I don't have to piss every 45 minutes.  All this stress and worry is a distant memory now and will stay that way as long as I continue to drive past the ""kratom outlet"" on my way home from work.  

For those lurking and planning a quit, do your research and get started.  The sooner you start, the sooner you are well if you can pull it off.  For those in the process, stay strong.  Focus on today with the promise of a better tomorrow.  For those post jump, be wary.  The green devil will try to pull you back by any means necessary.  Train yourself to be grateful and positive.  Your perception will dictate your experience to a large degree.  You get what you expect.  Love and strength to you all.",56,0

I posted this on the r/addiction forum too. Basically I have 15 years of abusing drugs which started with about 5-6 years of pretty impressive adderall abuse. At one point towards the end of my adderall days I was taking over 120mg/day. I simply couldn‚Äôt stop without losing my job as I was worthless because of what it does to your motivation system. I was also drinking heavily and abusing Benzos. I then discovered kratom. I thought it was a miracle substance. I got off adderall easily and also quit drinking. Of course addiction is a progressive disease so I started up on other drugs in addition to kratom like Ritalin and occasional benzo abuse. Right now I‚Äôm SEVERELY addicted to kratom. Like upwards of 100 grams a DAY which is INSANE. I‚Äôm dropping $60 a DAY on this habit. I just went to kaiser and told my psychiatrist EVERYTHING. He referred me to an addiction doctor who recommended suboxone. I‚Äôm hesitant to trade one addiction for another...but the statistics seem stacked against me. Anyone have any thoughts on getting on suboxone for a near decade long relationship with extensive doses of kratom?

Edit: the addiction doctor has a lot of experience now with kratom. He said he‚Äôs started seeing a lot more people come in who‚Äôs lives have been ruined by kratom. So he knows what it is unlike a lot of other doctors.",4,0

* DLPA 1000mg + L-tyrosine 1000mg
* Vitamin C, B complex, Magnesiun, Omega 3, L-theaning (sometimes)

**Questinons**

* Do you think that DLPA + L-tyrosine every morning was depleted serotonine? I have Tryptophan, but I dont use them from 61 - 95 day
* I dont think beers are something what is starting PAWS, but I am trying to avoid it to max 1 beer. What you think?
* Last 2 weeks excercise is very intense, my muscles are burning, can it be reason for insomnia or PAWS?
* Insomnia this night was like in acute phase of WD (every hour wake up) 8-10x
* On day 64 I stopped vape CT - vaped every whole day  juice of 5-10mg nicotine (can I have nicotine withdrawal at 97 ?)

Told my doctor im trying to taper and she prescribed me clonazepam, which helps at night to sleep and not take a hefty dose of K before bed. 

My coworker gave me vyvanse at work one weekend (I work at a nightclub) and I noticed how well it worked for the mental cravings regarding anxiety and depression to dose K. Fast forward I told my doctor about this and she prescribed me vyvanse to trial. (30mg) 

I had been taking one and a half 30mg daily for about a week and it was REALLY helping, i felt focused and optimistic and in control over my compulsion and needing to dose K. But recently I feel very weird, like Sunday I had extreme anxiety and depression and feeling agitated, shivering with dilated pupils only taking a half of one with body aches and chest pains on the left. I stopped taking vyvanse 3 days ago and feel a little better but upped my kratom intake again.

Anyway I was wondering If these three substances could interact in a way to cause serotonin syndrome or something? Or could it be from the drastic drop in the amount of kratom? I also drink coffee daily, and vape nicotine.

Throwaway account because certain people know my main and I don‚Äôt want this stuff getting out. I‚Äôm a 30yo male from central Canada, and I want to get off of kratom. Reading everyone‚Äôs experiences here has given me the courage to finally try and quit once and for all, so I thought I‚Äôd vent my situation as well. 

So my background in addiction goes back some ways, first serious addiction was to oxycodone beginning when I was around 17-18. I was mainly doing Oxycontin and Percocet, and I maxed out at about 2-3 80mg Oxys per day. I got off of that stuff in 2010 when I was 20, by moving out of the province to a super remote location with my best friend, somewhere where I was 100% never going to find it. All I had to help me was a few Seroquel I got from my aunt, which I used to sleep and get me through the real hard days. I was also taking half packs of Nytol (Benadryl) every night to sleep. My job at the time consisted of almost no human contact, so I was able to just put my head down and suffer it out. So I am a bit experienced with withdrawal, which I‚Äôm sure doesn‚Äôt help with the anxiety of going through it again. 

I did dabble in Percs and stuff over the next few years, but never more than a single night, maybe once every several months at most, but mostly not. But then I developed really bad tooth problems, and the pain was literally unbearable so I started self-medicating with Percs again. I know, super dumb idea. Anyway, after about 2-3 months of that an old friend who I used to do Oxy with told me about this miracle plant (lol) that she used to get off of it, and it piqued my interest. I never thought about getting some though, until as fate would have it I was sent some. I worked in a vape shop at the time and we just so happened to be sent a sample of kratom from a vendor that I can‚Äôt recall. I thought ‚Äúhey, I may as well try‚Äù, and then that was it. This was in about 2016, and I‚Äôve been on it ever since. I started at 4 grams per day, which eventually developed into my current intake, which varies from 65-78 grams per day, split into 5+ 13g doses. I‚Äôve been at that level for about a year, give or take. Sometimes I‚Äôd take an extra dose or two, sometimes a dose or two less. Consistency is a bit lacking, to say the least. 

So here I am today, wanting very badly to get off of this stuff. I‚Äôve gone days without it since I‚Äôve been on it, but not very often and pretty much only when I ran out. I remember the feelings I used to feel before K, the same way I did when I got off of opiates, but it‚Äôs such a struggle to get there again. For me, the worst is the restless legs. Not being able to get any rest is absolutely killer, especially since I work on my feet all day, plus I‚Äôm working 11-14 days straight with one day off constantly to pay the bills since my gf is out of work. Not easy on essentially minimum wage, to get rent, car payments, insurance, internet, food, phones, etc, and spending $200 every 2 weeks on K certainly doesn‚Äôt help that. For the last 4-5 days I‚Äôve forced myself down to about 21 grams per day, taking 7g in the morning, later in the day, and before sleep. I wake up like clockwork 5 hours after I lay down in withdrawals, which has been when I take my first 7g dose just to get another couple of hours of sleep before work. Im debating on trying to suffer it out and try for a hard drop to two 7g doses per day, one as late in the day as I can stand and then one before bed. Like I said the no sleep is the worst for me, especially since I‚Äôve had trouble sleeping for my entire life. I know it will suck, but if I can stabilize at or around that level for a month or two I‚Äôm going to try and cut my doses by about 1g every week, and jump when I feel semi-certain I‚Äôll be able to sleep. I would taper slower, according to the awesome taper guide that‚Äôs on here, but unfortunately my current income doesn‚Äôt really allow me to do that. It also sucks that I work in retail, meaning a ton of face-to-face customer interactions, which I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt have to tell you but I really do not want to do that while going through withdrawal. I also can‚Äôt afford to take any days off of work, so that‚Äôs going to suck. 

This was a lot longer than I had planned, and to be honest I have a million other things I could say, but I just had to get this stuff out somewhere. I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life I can be accountable to, and so I‚Äôve been trying to do this all on my own. I‚Äôve gotten down to three 7g doses per day recently by switching to a different vendor, but I ran out and my usual vendor that I bought from all these years has next day shipping so I went with them just to have some. I‚Äôm assuming that due to tolerance to their stuff  it does absolutely nothing for me though, and I went back up to 13g per dose just to get relief. I ordered from the other place recently, hoping it comes before the weekend because I only have five 7g doses of the usual stuff left. I also have a friend who‚Äôs going to give me a few Lorazepam just to sleep for a couple nights after I finally jump. I know the next couple weeks or months are going to be really shitty, but here‚Äôs hoping I can stick to it. Thanks to anyone that reads, and if anyone has any suggestions I‚Äôm all ears.",2,0

I have finally had a long stretch now (\~4 weeks) of feeling ""normal"".  Prior to that I had been stuck in this pattern of feeling good for a week then terrible for a week, wash, rinse repeat. 

It takes a long time to get off of this shit fully. I was on an almost year long habit of nearly daily 1 - 3 tsp doses. I still have some trouble when it comes to dealing with stress but the nerve pains, fatigue, cravings, trouble sleeping, depressed thoughts are largely gone. I believe that being able to better manage stress is also coming for me.

My advice for those who are quitting:

1) Don't leave any kratom lying around. During those times when you feel ""good"" you may be temped to say the f with it and try some more. Bad idea. It will only set you back in your recovery.

2) Don't waste money on doctors to try to feel better during the WD. They will not know whats wrong with you and will prescribe you a myriad of drugs to help, which will only delay your recovery or take you back. The brain is craving anything to ""latch onto"" to fill that void left by kratom. Just deal with the WD symptoms and keep reminding yourself that nothing is physically wrong with you, its the kratom.

3) Drink alot of water and stay as active as possible. Idle lying around feeling sorry for yourself is not good and could lead to more kratom use.

I am a thinker. I contemplate so many things and try to find meaning from every single event that I experience. I am often overwhelmed with existential thoughts about why I am alive and what is my purpose. These thoughts have always severely impacted my life as I struggle to find motivation to do anything. My anxious mind needed something to numb the overactivity in my head and Kratom filled that gap perfectly.

I won‚Äôt bore everyone with my life story, however, I am here to say that for some of us, quitting kratom is about resolving or learning to live with the psychological challenges that we have been so lucky to come across. Its so easy to choose to go back to Kratom when the reality of my problems become too much to handle. Kratom is an excellent ‚Äòmask‚Äô, however, it removes part of who we really are that I think is important. Feeling numb is bittersweet but so is life. To truly enjoy our lives, we need to learn to deal with the hardships. That may be a different journey for each of us, but this community was the biggest first step that I took to get my life back. I have a long way to go, but getting rid of Kratom is one of the most important moves.

I miss being human... sooo so much.

Best of luck to you all, I hope you can get through this stage of your life.

I was addicted to opiates and ended up going on suboxone for the last 5 years of my opiate battle. My opiate career ended with an overdose from fentanyl which landed me in a medicated coma for over 2 days. The medical staff didnt know if I would ever have full brain or heart function again but miraculously I was discharged from the ICU after a week. This was just the beginning of my painful path to sobriety. Since I was still on suboxone when I overdosed, I still had to endure the painful suboxone withdrawal. Long story short, I didnt sleep for about a month but after that my life slowly started to come back. I ended up staying sober from any mood altering substance for over a year and then I met this beautiful girl and we started dating. Life was awesome so naturally I had to mess it up and start smoking weed and eating kratom. I didnt notice it at first but the kratom slowly changed the person i was and made me lazy. I turned into a shell of myself. The highs were not as high and the lows were not as low. Sadly, i didnt realize this until after my beautiful girlfriend broke up with me and i lost my job. That was about 2 weeks ago and i finally came to the realization that the kratom was mostly responsible for this. It is all my fault obviously, but the kratom didnt help. So, here I am.

I am yet again trying to quit kratom, and my wife asked me to find someone to talk to about this. She has really tried over the years to be my support system but it just has not been good for our relationship and usually end with me betraying her or lying to her. I have been to NA meetings and the people seem great, but that really wasn't my scene. When I told them I was addicted to kratom they kind of rolled their eyes at me, or didn't seem to know what it was.

So I wanted to reach out and see if anyone in the QK family is from the Central Ohio or Columbus Ohio area that is actively trying to quit and likes the idea of meeting up with someone in the same boat, or some like minded individuals who would like to discuss quitting kratom and supporting each other. 

There's not a lot of resources in our area in terms of quitting kratom, and would like to eventually start a local support group. Not quite like NA or AA, or anything overboard or super religious. Just maybe a weekly or monthly meeting where we get coffee and discuss.

It‚Äôs clear the half life wears off at about the 12-15 hour mark. This is when I get really runny nose ,sweaty anxiety levels up. 

I took about .5 ml maybe even less first thing this morning so I could get all my responsibilities handled and get to work. I hope that wards off all the symptoms another 10-15 hours this would be great. 

With extracts there isn‚Äôt really a way to measure what this equals it n regular powders. 

If I use the math provided I had basically been taking over 3 thousands grams a day of regular. 

Honestly, there is no way.  I can still get effects from a few grams of regular... so I am certain many alkaloids equal to 100s to a thousand of grams are lost in the extract process. I don‚Äôt really even know..... 

Anyone have a similar experience? Any tips on how to ward off the WD feelings and push thru? No looking to trade and substance for another but any all natural aids?",3,0

i am at the end of day one, last dose being last night right about 23 hrs ago.

Not really sure what this post is other than looking for support, and venting a bit. this has been a huge struggle for me, as i am a huge supporter of plant medicine, however, this one as i am learning can be abused,  they are powerful medicines... i still think its better than oxy, i digress... internal battles.

i ended up on kratom \*again\* due to a massive brain injury causing alot of pain. those pain issues are gone now, and ive recently realized how negatively the kratom is effecting me, and how badly i want off it, but really how much of a grip it has on me...

 im not asking for a mirical answer to fix this, i guess this just seemed like a place to look to for support, for a bit at least, while i take on this battle. Tips are appreciated though...

\*prescribed Klonopin regularly. i take .25mg 2x/day, but im prescribed 1mg3x/day, and during this i have gone up to my perscribed dose to manage anxiety untill it passes. im not worried of this, as i HATE the feeling of Klonopin, and i know i will be so ready to drop that back to .25 within a week if the kratom withdrawals are gone. i have exp with this, i was forced by drs to take it, and constantly fought them cause i wouldnt take it... i know its deadly addctive to some, but i truly hate the stuff. i like my wits about me. lol and for what its worth, the Klonopin is for a 2 month bout after a seizure which we found the causation for. i wont be taking it long, not replacing one with another.

My story is similar to many on here. I came across Kratom after I quit drinking. My husband knew about it when I first tried it but once my use became daily I just didn‚Äôt mention it to him. I didn‚Äôt want him to worry and frankly it seemed to be miraculous. I‚Äôm a mom of a 4 year old, I work full time and go to college at night. Kratom seemed to help all my problems. I felt more focused, I had more energy and the best part I didn‚Äôt think about drinking at all. 

I had been taking it daily for approximately 6 months when I learned that I was physically addicted. I don‚Äôt exactly remember how I learned I was but shortly after I realized I decided I needed to get rid of this habit ASAP. I certainly didn‚Äôt feel mentally addicted. So I detoxed and went a month without using it and then started back on it. I‚Äôve been using it pretty regularly since. I‚Äôve tried quitting bunches of times but I can only make it a few days to a week before using again. 

I quit ct 3 days ago. I‚Äôm back at work today and I‚Äôve already relapsed. It dawned on me the last time I quit (about 2 months ago) that one of the triggers could be my job. It‚Äôs within close proximity to where I get Kratom. I also realized today that one trigger is how boring my job is and how difficult my boss is. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a good job and the pay is good and there is lots of opportunity for growth. I knew when I took this job that I would be leaving once I got my degree (this December). I could potentially find another job in the field I‚Äôm going to school for but I without my degree I would be taking a substantial pay cut.  

I‚Äôm desperate to get better. I am seeing a counselor, I‚Äôve started taking Wellbutrin to help with underlying anxiety and depression issues. I‚Äôve tried support groups and didn‚Äôt feel exactly safe. I have so many ‚Äúwhys‚Äù and yet they flee my brain when faced with temptation. 

My first question is do any of you feel like you have detox amnesia? I will go through the pain and hell of detoxing and swear to myself I will never touch the stuff and then a few days later I‚Äôm back at it. It‚Äôs insane to me. I mean if physical torture isn‚Äôt reason enough to change then what is? If you have experienced this then what things do you find help? 

My other question is: have any of you made significant life changes in order to avoid relapse? In other words, am I fooling myself for thinking that work could be a trigger for my using? I would hate to move jobs and take substantial pay cut and forfeit my opportunity with this company only to find that a different job has no impact on my cravings. 

I‚Äôm anxious to hear what you have to say. Sorry for the long post! Thanks for reading üòä",1,0

This isn't my first rodeo with this ""miracle plant"". My last time doing this I didnt get out until day 7. 
I'm not going back to kratom ever again, the love affair is over. The turning point in this battle was my first writhing sleepless night when I decided I never wanted any of the ""benefits"" of kratom ever again and that I wasn't going back no matter what the withdrawals threw at me. Well the WD's got worse, but I was determined so it didnt matter. My WD's got so bad I thought I was going to die, painful crawling skin, hyperventilating and diarrhea, so I said to God ok I guess I'm coming home because I'm not gonna use kratom to get out, it didnt last forever and I didnt die. 
I lurked for maybe an hr before I jumped in head first, having experienced this process before I felt I had something to contribute and nobody made me feel like a dumbass for giving advice or praying for them wich I beleive helped me.

When I took Kratom before, there were times when I wouldn‚Äôt take it for a day or so and experienced no withdrawal. I haven‚Äôt taken any Kratom since this morning and plan for this to be it. I‚Äôve read so many stories on how hard it is to quit and that you definitely do experience withdrawal. Is it possible not to? Everyone‚Äôs different and I‚Äôm sure varying factors play a part. I‚Äôve also heard that once you have taken substances for a certain amount of time, even once you quit, if you take something even once or for a short amount of time, you‚Äôve ‚Äúkindled‚Äù your receptors, so will experience withdrawal when before, when your brain was healthy, you wouldn‚Äôt have.

I've tried many, many times and I seem to always let my physical senses override my logical drive. The first couple of times that I successfully (temporarily it seems) quit, I always had a huge emotional drive to stop. One of the things that helped while dealing with the consequences of my addiction was to check this sub constantly, trying to find posts where the quitter was in similar circumstances as me (i.e. GPD, time using, life situations, etc.). Though I know with Kratom the symptoms are by no means linear, I am a numbers guy. I believe in the law of averages. So my idea is to create a Google Form that will collect data on peoples physical/mental experiences with respect to time use, and time off.  One thing that has stuck out to me is people say that the symptoms are waves in nature, which I have experienced myself. I believe if I collect enough data, we will see an average SIN wave whose frequency and amplitude decrease, and period increase over an average time frame. I know that while quitting, if I had access to such data, it would help me monumentally. I was curious as to if people here might be interested in contributing to such a data collection, anonymously of course, and I wanted to make sure that it was okay with the moderators of the sub. I will use the response to this sub in my decision to create such a poll, and with the approval of the moderators. Please let me know what everyone thinks. I look forward to hearing from you. -Wack

But isn't this only some anxiety that generates by lack of kratom?  Now im withdrawaling from kratom i'm 4days absolutely without it. But if my anxiety won't get better id starts abusing it again because THIS LIFE SUCKS. I just feel anxious , i dont have any good experience recently... I'm just surviving. PLEASE tell my. Do you think that my anxiety is worse because that i abused kratom??? I think that i would be rather death. Because this life sucks. Really. AND yes i have tried MANY meds. Like about 10 types of meds. AND yes i have therapy and psycholog and psychiatrist. But no it isn't helping at all.

Im just surviving. I dont like this life. If this isn't going to be better, i'll start abusing some worse drugs and commit suicide. I DONT think that i get used to be anxious all day and can't even do anything.

Im without school and without work, because i can't do anything. For real, i was just used to that i worked only on kratom, but then i said to me that i dont want life that depending only on some SUBSTANCE. Because without it im just anxious shitty person that doesnt want to live.

I know that i have anxiety disorder and i will have some anxiety forever, but isn't it worse because that i was using kratom? If yes, when i would feel better? Like how long i must to be without it until i notice some change. I hope that my anxiety is worse only because that i was used to do kratom to be happier person. But i feel like without kratom i'll be suffering even more. I dont know what to do. I'm meditating, taking nonaddictive herbs, like ashwagandha, valerian root, lemon balm, magnesium.. But it isn't even helping. And i'm on quatiapine and buspirone. DONT FEEL ANYTHING from these meds. I hope that kratom just blocked some effection of these meds. or something like this. if not, ill be dead pretty soon with this anxiety.",5,0

I have a trip coming up in one week that coincides with my taper. I will be flying across the country with my girlfriend for 6 days. 


I don't want to take a bunch of leaf powder with me or buy anything when I get there. My plan currently is to take as little kratom as I can over the next week until the trip. I was also thinking of buying some extract and putting it in capsules before flying out. Enough for about 3 small doses per day (say 20 capsules all together). 


About how many grams of extract would I need to achieve this? I have only taken extract one time and I wasn't blown away or anything.


I have quit before so I am aware of the effects and trajectory of withdrawals. I'm just looking for advice on how to manage the symptoms so I am able to function during vacation.


Thank you and peace!",2,0

I went down a rabbit hole with old QK posts recently about Kratom and IBS (or Existing GI issues prior to Kratom use). It would seem that people are using Kratom to ease their IBS, Crohns, or Colitis- or just GI issues. They were saying it was the miracle drug and the only thing ever to relieve the symptoms that some of them had their entire lives. 

Knowing this makes me feel a little better about myself seeing I was finding it hard to quit because Kratom kept my GI issues under control, among other things but that was a big one. 

A few of the people who thought it was a miracle drug tried to quit and obviously realized they were addicted and that their GI symptoms got worse after the quit. 

Another way that Kratom masks real symptoms and allows us to slide by doing the work. Today I am grateful for quitting and for doing the work to heal deep within- even if it at times causes me excruciating pain. 

I remember when I thought it was a miracle powder!! Hahaha what a joke. Energy to ride my bike almost all night- relief of all anxiety- GI issues calmed down- able to deal with human beings- relaxed- until it all backfired :) sneaky Kratom

My goal was to average around 9gpd, which unfortunately I didn't achieve. I had daily gpd from last Saturday to yesterday of 14, 11, 10, 10, 10, 8, 10. I have pretty successfully eliminated my midday dosage all together, so I currently use a dosage in the morning and the evening. I have had some success lowering my morning dosage, but this week I was inconsistent with keeping it low.

Yesterday was the hardest; on Thursday, I completely skipped my night dosage and had 4g around 10:30 Friday morning. My plan was to try not to use anymore til Saturday morning, which would mean only 4g in about 46 hours or so. Throughout the day I felt fine. Around 8pm though I was mentally looking forward to my nightly kratom. It seemed to be a combination of mild withdrawal as well as habitual instinct. I tried to fight it, but my willpower wasn't strong and I had a 6g dosage.

Some wins on the week, aside from eliminating my midday dosage, I made it an entire week on one 3oz bag. Normally that would last me 3 days tops. But I bought this bag last Saturday and will finish it today. That's at least a movement in the right direction.

And now begins week 3. This week my goal is to get around 6gpd. I don't expect this to be easy, but I do expect it to be achievable. Hope everyone out there on their own kratom journeys find peace and success for the days and weeks ahead.",3,0

I never thought for 18 months straight that I‚Äôd be able to beat this substance, especially on those days mentioned. The fog, the fatigue, the pain, the restlessness, it all dragged me down. I wanted these feelings to go away!

To help keep my mind away from craving and all the pain, I wrote a journal on those 8 days. I suggest everyone do the same. 

I read that journal every morning before I start my day. It helps me to remember what I was feeling like, and I can compare those feelings to how I feel today.

It‚Äôs no comparison, haha! The way I feel today is the total opposite of how I felt using, It‚Äôs like I climbed a mountain and now I‚Äôm atop.

With the money I saved in 6 weeks of not using, I bought a brand new car. I can afford it now.

If I go back to that life of drinking and stimulants that is me done, so I need to find a balance, maybe I can just use it on weekends when I would usually be triggered.

Or hopefully I now have enough time under my belt that those old habits will not return and I can just quit everything.

At my highest I was at around 10 grams of kratom per day, I've brought this down to 4 grams.

What do people think I should do? Just quit entirely but risk falling back into other habits?

Can anyone tell me how long it takes for the memory to return after quitting?

First time posting. So here is my brief history. Thank you in advance to any response or kind words. 

I‚Äôve used Kratom for pain off and on for just over three years. I‚Äôd take it everyday for several months, then taper off. This last time, I went maybe 8 months at around 28g per day average. After that I‚Äôd take a similar amount once or twice a week. Then I used daily again for 6-8 weeks, and have finished another taper about 17 days ago. So I am 17 days free of Kratom at the moment. 

I‚Äôve struggled all my life with a lot of anxiety and PTSD from childhood trauma. Depression is sometimes moderate to severe. So those have always been back and forth for 37 years that I can remember. There have been decent stints in life too. 

I wake up every morning and stretch. Then meditate 15-20 minutes. Usually go to the gym after.  No supplements. No medication. Just raw dogging life. I eat pretty healthy. I smoke some cigarettes at night which definitely does not help. Maybe 3-6 a night. I‚Äôve been going to therapy every other week and going to this recovery dharma meeting once or twice a week. 

So I say all that to stay,

I am REALLY struggling with depression and anxiety. Hard to get through the days. I‚Äôll get so mad over the simplest things I‚Äôll just start shaking. A hedonic is through the rough usually. Money is tight for me. I have a son whom I‚Äôm greatly fiscally responsible for and no family/help there. I have to drive Uber many hours each day. School. Other jobs. Struggling greatly financially. I‚Äôm often short/rude with most people and feel very guilty. I‚Äôm just really really down and want some hope. I suppose I‚Äôm just in the midst of PAWS, but given my life history before Kratom it‚Äôs so easy to think something is broken and I‚Äôll never feel joy for anything. So there I am.",9,0

I have been addicted to caffeine for about 8 years and have an INCREDIBLY high tolerance for it (like can drink lots of coffee right before bed and sleep fine). Caffeine was extremely helpful in the first few weeks because of the fatigue and mental fog from kratom withdrawal, so I have been drinking it regularly. At about week 3 or 4 I started getting incredible anxiety. I was basically on the edge of a panic attack all day everyday and was having actual panic attacks at least once or twice a day. I thought it was a symptom of PAWS until I realized that the only time I felt less anxious was when I woke up in the morning before my coffee. I decided to start drinking a cup of green tea instead of coffee in the morning (about 1/6-1/3 the amount of caffeine) and I feel so much better! I am a little more tired and definitely still have anxiety but I no longer feel like I'm on the edge of a panic attack 24/7. I still drink coffee in the afternoon sometimes and have now also noticed that I get crazy heart palpitations after drinking it. Like I can see my heart beating all over my body.... Caffeine has never done anything like this to me before and I am drinking less than I normally do. Has this happened to anyone else / did it go away? One part of me is happy I am more sensitive to it because I should probably drink less anyway but I also don't want to give it up forever. Also wish I could get a boost of energy sometimes but am afraid of my heart going crazy or getting more anxiety. Any advice?",1,0

I started taking Kratom in 2013. I had attempted quitting numerous times but never really made it past 2 months. The post acutes were ripping me apart. I consistently felt like I wasn‚Äôt myself. The withdrawals never seemed to go away. When I made the decision this time to quit I meant it. Whatever it took, I was going to do it. So I began to research detoxing, supplements, etc for Kratom. I came across tons of interesting information about Naltrexone, clonidine, and Gabapentin. All of these medications had been used to successfully detox even the most hardcore of addicts. 

During, my research I came across the term Precipitated Withdrawal. It‚Äôs a method that detox clinics use to rapidly detox patients using Naltrexone and some anesthesia. The patient is put under a light anesthesia and then Naltrexone is dripped which begins to force the opioid receptors to cleanse. Essentially, it rapidly removes and detoxes the brain. 

I continued researching and found that many people had attempted an at home rapid detox using just Naltrexone and some anti anxiety medicine. I am not a doctor so I can‚Äôt say that this is safe but I decided I would do it. 

On February 1st @ 9pm I took my prescribed anti anxiety medication and when I felt it start working I went for the Naltrexone. 

@10pm I took around 12.5mg of Naltrexone and a full glass of water. I then laid down and fell asleep. 

@10:45pm I awoke drenched in sweat and had HORRIBLE body aches and Restlessness. My entire body wanted to thrash and flail. I moaned and groaned in pain. At this point, my wife, who is a nurse, had me go upstairs to the guest room so that I wouldn‚Äôt risk waking our 1 yr old son. 

Between 11pm-8am: I went through Hell. I yelled at the shadows on the walls, my body felt like it needed to contort. I felt like the pain was in my bones. I punched the bed and the air. I had the sensation of bugs crawling through my skin. My head throbbed. I fluctuated between hot and cold and nothing would help regulate my body temperature. I saturated the bed in sweat. I cried a lot. I felt like I had tremors and couldn‚Äôt even hold my phone still. The intensity of this gradually increased and I felt like the ceiling was closing down on me. I prayed and prayed. 

I don‚Äôt remember when I fell asleep but I remember my wife waking me up at noon. When I opened my eyes I had this amazing sensation of being clean and sober. It‚Äôs truly hard to explain how good this felt. My body was a wreck though. I felt like I had been literally hit by a bull. All of my muscles hurt. The whole day I had this strange cloudy sensation and was extremely fatigued. But I still felt this overwhelming feeling of success. That evening I slept well. No RLS, no insomnia. I‚Äôm now on day 12 completely off Kratom. I still sleep well. The cravings come and go but have been more manageable then ever before. I get waves of anxiety some days as if my mind is saying ‚Äúhey man, you‚Äôre missing something.‚Äù Etc. But overall I feel exceptional. The Naltrexone, in my experience compressed 2 weeks of acutes into one night of hell. I now use LDN at 1.5mg each night before bed. It‚Äôs been crushing the fatigue that sometimes lingers after detox.

I have weaned myself off of opiates several times (at the worst I was on 2x150mcg fentanyl patches with 80mg oxy and 80mg hydro for breakthrough pain).

I'm 116 hours (about 4.8 days) CT at 6gpd from a high of 120gpd just a couple months ago. The withdrawals were a lot worse in my mind than the actual symptoms I am seeing. The RLS is almost non existent, the upset stomach is very minimal, and the all day (every effing minute) anxiety has evaporated.

Now with that being said, I am taking Magnesium Glycinate 400mg 2x day, kava capsules 245mg x 8 capsules 2x day, B-Complex 3x day, 4mg tizanidine (for sleep) nightly, and regular vitamins (I take a minimum of 3 a day).

So far, I do have moments where the anxiety sneaks in and ramps up the suicidal ideation, but I learned long ago to talk myself down from panic attacks rather than use chemicals. I am having moments where my energy and enthusiasm are nil, and motivation seems light-years away.

This is, however, the point where I have started thinking ""this ain't bad, I could totally still use kratom and not worry anymore"" and that scares the shit out of me. I have suffered chronic back pain from multiple injuries and a major surgery (I lived hard, played hard, and fought hard). 

Opiates are not my friend, cannabis is illegal where I live so smoking is the only route, but a chancy one. I don't want to smoke anyway because of a lifetime of smoking tobacco and bud has caused some mild breathing issues. 

So now I sit here with the pain really ramping up today thinking ""What now?"" I don't want to hurt all the time, I don't want electrodes in my spinal cavity, I don't want opiates. I don't wanna live a life where I eat mj edibles everyday staying mentally bombed all day. That's when the suicidal ideation comes in. And it sucks.

I‚Äôve quit before without realizing it (bc I was naive and didn‚Äôt think I was addicted). This was in the summer; I quit for a month bc I was in Europe. First week I slept a lot and was hot as hell during that heat wave.

My dosage increased since then to what I said above. Have been doing this for about 6-7 months now.

I was fully convinced it was making my life better, helping me with my back pain, relieving anxiety, etc. 

I decided to start tapering two weeks ago. Well not exactly a taper actually, but basically I‚Äôd go as long as I possibly could without dosing and when I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore I‚Äôd take one dose. I did this each day for a week and the withdrawals sucked. They were mostly physical. My back was in agonizing pain all day long at work and I couldn‚Äôt get any relief. 

A week ago I decided to say fuck it and went CT. Tapering was just prolonging the misery. The first four days were straight hell. My skin was on fire and my insides were ice. I was so restless and exhausted. Angry and miserable. My bones wanted to jump out of my skin. It sucked. 

Now it‚Äôs been a week though and the worst of it is over. I‚Äôm feeling real emotions for the first time in so long and finally feel like myself again. And my back feels fine. Kratom was literally making my body convince itself it was experiencing pain that doesn‚Äôt exist.

Phenibut - For immediate cold turkey withdrawal

Multi Vitamins

B Complex

Magnesium

Ephedrine - for fatigue and replacing the Kratom stim feeling ( I took it before I took Kratom) 

L Theanine - For curbing anxiety

Ashwaganda - bringing back your mood 

Walking more - keeps your mind occupied and reverses depression

Kava/CBD??

It's just a matter of figuring out what the Kratom has damaged and effected and targeting those symptoms by temporary relieving them and gradually healing them.

I joined this sub because it's time to change that, and this is a small step in the right direction. I've made several small decreases, but I'm still at 25-30gpd as of today. I'm envious of those of you that have quit and need your support. I'm 40 now and I started with pills in my mid 20s. It got to scary levels and even some heroin use. 5 years ago I got clean from that by discovering kratom. I should have used it for a month or two but here I am 5 years later. I'd like to just go qt, but have some concerns. I am the only income of my family. I work a very physical job as a contractor and if I miss days the bills dont get paid. It seems like I'm staying on kratom just to keep my family's head above water. Also when I think about quitting I'm reminded of the severe withdrawals I went through with pills and that makes me hesitate. I believe that qt is my only option as I've never had the self control to taper anything. Has anyone gone through a similar scenario, if so how long did it take for you to get back to work?

Coffee/High Caffeine is the original gateway drug. I notice that during my kratom use I would use coffee right before to give it an extra boost, and I would always need it before, but it would actually always make me eventually up my kratom dose because I'd be so strung out on coffee all the time that I would want to come down with kratom (which is stimulating itself). Now during withdrawal, coffee seems to help a lot right? Well I think that's a good and bad thing because of the high caffeine. They are related (the plants of coffee and kratom) and I don't know all the science behind it, but right now I think tea is a way better option, and I was always a coffee guy. I feel so much more calm on tea, and it makes the withdrawals a little less intense with the slight caffeine boost and theanine. When I drink coffee during withdrawals I get anxiety attacks, I get super aggressive, cry more, and I truly believe now that coffee can cause kratom cravings from the anxiety and other factors.

The definition (and benefits) of a taper come from its ‚Äúgradual nature‚Äù.  A fast taper may prolong the withdrawal symptoms and make quitting seem overwhelming & extremely uncomfortable (& worse yet, you know that you are going through all of this discomfort and you haven‚Äôt really quit Kratom.)

curious why folks seem to opt for this route (so often).

I've ordered Ashwagandha, ""restful"" leg tablets, magnesium, black seed oil, l-tyrosine, a bottle of pepto, Imodium, a probiotic, sleepy-time teas, and a whole bunch of 92% dark chocolate.

If you're still at 8-10, maybe elongate the taper another week for a higher chance of success. Thats where I am at. Thats what I am doing.

Also, night time is the worst. Its when I used to drink the most, and I feel like thats when a lot of us wish we had that head high that would to make us close our eyes and bask in that opiate like feeling. I hope this does not trigger someone. But hey, its the truth.

This is my 4th day like this and have not used any today.  Not feeling particularly inclined to dose tho also feeling sorta ambivalent in general.  I got some 1:1 THC/CBD RSO oil which seems to REALLY help knock me out n help me stay asleep .  I think deep sleep is very healing esp re the brain .

Seemed a lot of the success stories on here I‚Äôve read involved long tapering processes.  Almost a way to gradually shift homeostasis while also reprogramming mind in a more doable way.  The one time in last year I did manage to quit kratom for a week it was after the once a day mentality went on for a few weeks.  Then a day cane I just didn‚Äôt want it and instead of withdrawals I think I really just felt more attuned to fact I generally felt better.  

The time I tried to quit CT from an ounce+ a day tho... horrible.  Was like a sudden onset hangover + flu nightmare.  Looking back I‚Äôm amazed in the moment I wasn‚Äôt more disturbed tbh.

Hoping today is day I just let it go completely but must say the tapering feels doable.  Reading n writing on here really helps keep me focused too and reading the success stories of people well into their recovery is inspiring as I Know this too shall pass.

Days 1-5 HELL.  I‚Äôm not even gonna sugar coat it. Shit sucked .. today.. day 6 I feel a little better ..I have still not slept.. and when I say not slept.. I mean NOT at all. Literally 5 hours in 6 days total! It has made me mean and on edge. Zombie like .. I am constantly apologizing for being a cunt .. pardon my language, but that is the accurate word for who I have been this past week. 

Luckily I have support and kindness at home. Today in the midst of this hell.. I took a shower (although I watched all my hair continue to fall out) .. I then did the hair I had left.. I put on makeup and then left and went to my sons‚Äô school for lunch with family day.. it took every bit of strength for me to do this. 

Middle of withdrawals. Driving with no sleep.. fixing myself up so that the outside of me is different from how I feel inside.. then going to eat lunch with 200 screaming 4th graders.. BUT. I DID IT !!! .not saying it was easy... but...My son was grateful.. his smile made it worth it ... It wasn‚Äôt his fault that I‚Äôm like this now.. 
anyway.. still have massive body pain.. temperature fluctuations.. kidney/side /abdomen pain.. and NO sleep.. but every single day DOES feel better than the last. 

I was a 7-8 month user of about 25 gpd.. I won‚Äôt go back... I‚Äôm stronger than that sludge.. I wish you all luck. We got this!!

I have never talked about my problems with addiction online but I just feel like I'm at my last straw and want to share my story to people who have been on the same or at least a similar boat.

So my history with opioids started off with tramadol in 2014. Above all else, I smoke weed, and in my country there was a weed drought that lasted about a year. Not that weed has ever been easy to get in my country or that laws have ever been lenient, but during that period it was practically impossible. My friends and I started experimenting with synthetic cannabinoids and downers (tramadol, codeine, benzos) because of this (I'm not saying that weed is a gateway drug, we were just trashy kids who always wanted to get loose and wild). The synthetic cannabinoids just felt gross to me, but after a couple of times on tramadol, codeine and benzos (especially tramadol) I started loving it.

I was on 100 MGs of tramadol from 2014 to 2016, and managed to keep it steady, only taking more or combining with other downers when offered at parties. Then in 2016, I felt life wasn't going so good so I started constantly upping my doses. However, in the fall of 2016, I started going to college in Washington, where weed is recreationally legal. From 2016 to 2017, I was off all opioid or opioid-related substances, or anything with an opioid-receptor or GABA-receptor activity. I was just so taken aback with Washington's progressive and lenient attitudes towards cannabis, especially coming from a backwards country where people have been killed for it and done more time for it than something like meth. So, I mainly smoked weed. However, I also did ecstasy (MDMA/MDA), anytime between once a month to once every week, for about a year.

However, in 2017, I went back to my country for the summer, and immediately I was greeted with downers by old friends and was partying with them all summer long. When I got back to the US following that, I started seeking out GABA and opioid-type substances again, and finally found kratom. I like kratom more so than even oxy and the like, because it is more ""energetic"" and I have always preferred something like tramadol, which is more energetic, serotonergic and longer-lasting, than ""prime"" opioids like hydro, oxy and H (all of which I've tried once or twice and never felt like going back to because they are too ""dopey"").

OK, THAT'S THE END OF MY HISTORY

&#x200B;

Since that point on, I have been constantly on kratom. I have done doses up to 30 Gs, but for the most part my dosing regimen has been around 4.5 Gs three times a day. And today I just feel like I have to stop. The straw that broke the camel's back for me is the lucid nightmares that I have been experiencing nearly every day. I find that opioid-activity type substances but ABOVE ALL kratom give me extremely vivid and intense dreams unlike nothing else on this planet.

Today, I woke up from an extremely vivid dream involving many of my acquaintances, old and new, friends and family, people who I know in different groups but have never even met, let alone hung out with one another before. But they're all there, and when I ask them what's up/what's wrong, they told me to stop playing dumb, but I really didn't know what was going on. When I insisted I didn't know shit, they told me that in the past day, I had called each one of them (there were at least 50 people there) 100 times, so 5000 calls total, and that they reported me to the police because it is unlawful. Afterwards, my acquaintances and friends said that they got permission from the police to use violence on me, and started teaming up to beat the shit outta me. They kicked my head into walls.

I woke up out of touch with reality before realizing that something like that never happened, and just tried to chill out and calm myself down. But it is such an elaborate and vivid experience, a lot of the scenes are still very clear to me and it has been several hours. It's like an extremely well-done movie involving my friends and family. I have had vivid/lucid nightmares like this before but I can't cope with seeing or even recalling these scenes anymore. They are extremely traumatic. Like the ultimate bad trip. That's it for me. I can't carry on using kratom any longer.

Have any of you guys experienced anything like this?

Of course there are undeniable negative physical effects that I have suffered from kratom. And I have abused other drugs, which doesn't help, but currently kratom is actually the hardest thing to cut out and I haven't used any other drug as frequently as large doses of kratom. I have always had extremely vivid, almost lucid dreams on kratom, and they always take a fucking lot out of me.  To be honest, if I can sleep like a log for 8-10 hours without having ultimate horror bad trip dreams while being on this shit I would. I think kratom is relatively benign, it's not as toxic to the body as a lot of other stuff, but these vivid dreams and sleep paralysis are consistent with the symptoms of other opioids too. If some folks enjoy the dreams or don't get such a horror or sleep paralysis vibe from it then great. And I get that kratom helps many people a lot, more power to that. I personally really have to quit, and just ditch my whole addiction to anything with opioid activity.

Would appreciate thoughts or advice",1,0

I was at about 100GPD at the height of my addiction when I decided I wanted to quit I cut that down to 80 instantly, didnt even notice. Tried to go as long as I could on the weekend before I would use, lasted about 4 hrs next week same thing to 60GPD noticed it mentally not so much physically. Next week went 10 hrsCT, cut down to 40. This time the physical pain came back for a couple days. Went 16hrs CT, cut down to 30, went 29hrs CT and cut down to 15GPD. Pain still stays but I'm keeping my job with a very low dose (for me) when I cant take it anymore. At night's I go as long as I can until I take a dose to sleep and not use when I cant sleep just deal with it until I get to work. It hasn't been fun, but using this method I'm keeping my job and getting sleep (not a lot) and going faster. 
This weekend I have 3 days off, I plan to go CT that entire time and see how much I can get my tolerance down. Hopefully I can break free completely or knock it in half. Will keep you posted. My use time is about 2 years with a 3 month break in the middle.
Really happy when I found old notes I was taking on my taper and saw use 5√ó a day equaling 80 grams now I'm at 3√ó a day 15 grams, wow you can actually hammer this thing down it's only gonna take every bit of strength determination and willpower you have and let Jesus take care of the rest.",11,0

This post is me sharing my theory and attempt to kick Kratom for the 3rd time. I‚Äôve done both cold and taper and ct is the way to go becuase at the end of the day the withdraws are still terrible and just last longer. That being said, Kratom is killing my skin/hair. 

So as a healthcare professional and 5+ year addict I came up with an idea. This idea is formed from listening to doctors, Heroin addicts, nurses and reading more reddit post than I care to mention. I had used Kratom for 3 years and I noticed I felt emotionally drained, and my hair thinned (30-40g daily). Lately the sides are getting worse than opioids as with kratom there are other adrenal effects not well understood. my thyroid was decreased meaning it increased my over all metabolism and gave side effects I would compare with hyperthyroidism and it makes sense. So understanding subs and having kicked both Keatom and subs they both are god awful and id say kratom was worse kept me up for two weeks. So I decided to try using a 1-7 day sub taper algorithm for kratom. Let me state I am not suggesting subs long term but the side effects are much better understand than kratom and who knows what the guys at the local smoke shop put in it. If I had to stay on one for the rest of my life I would choose subs sadly it‚Äôs just better understood and the long term effects are almost non existent compared to hair loss adrenal insufficiency and liver toxicity of kratom, if kratom alkaloids pure were offered that might be the way to go. So I am going to be an experiment and share my research with those who want to kick this dam kratom. I got off subs, hydromorphone and kratom and by far the hardest was kratom.  Please only contribute valuable knowledge to my research thread. Also subs do not effect the liver thyroid and other organs, besides how hard the withdraws may be taking it seems safer (physically). I am starting a taper and will use a sub or to block the acute withdraws becuase I can not stop working and be up for 3 weeks like I did the first time. So day one log started. This is for research that can‚Äôt be done in medicine so I am doing my own and sharing the results.


Kratom usage opms shots/pills and Krave powder 30-40 g daily minimum


Day 0: last dose taken night before dr apt. 

Day 1: explained kratom to dr and got subs.
           - first dose took 8mg (higher than 4 most 
              recommend, but 1/3 of what the doctor    
              gave me for a day. 8 was very calculated   
              as a physician it‚Äôs given higher doses       
              ( 16-24)  at the    
              start for a week  to get blood level  
              High. To emulate this without getting    
              stuck taking subs to do did 1 initial                     
              loading dose and
             this stopped all withdraws completely. 
             Took at 4pm and was good the rest of the              
             day and night. 

Day 2: slept amazing, and woke up even a little            
            groggy. Went to work and had zero    
            withdraw symptoms all day except a slight     
           lack of energy which I will explain below.    
           Took a strip to work just encase, but did.   
           not even need it.  When I got home about 5   
           I took a second dose over 24 hours later at  
           4mg  and prior taking it had very mild if any    
           withdraw symptoms. 

Day 1,2  * learned research* 

Learned today that the reason kratom withdraws seem so terrible is the 2nd effect they have on the adrenal system. I had never noticed and just thought the withdraws were driving me crazy, but never realized when kratom is stopped your adrenal system  was so over worked it basically stops until your receptors detect they need to up regulate. I stumbled on this after taking the sub and feeling 150% exhausted. Before trying subs I just thought exhausted misery was the lack of opioids in the brain. After those were replaced I could tell my thyroid and adrenal system as a whole felt way over worked. Took a long nap and starting vitamins to attack an area many have over looked and that‚Äôs recovering the hormonal side of things. I would have never thought to add adrenal support and this may be a huge reason people go back because it takes the adrenal system a while to restore its function. More data to come. Best wishes everyone

Day 3- slept great and was withdraw free the whole day from yesterday‚Äôs 4mg dose. I did notice I was extremely tired like full on ADRENAL FATIGUE. So when stopping Kratom I think it‚Äôs extremely important to kick start the adrenal system, which I never realized and that‚Äôs why kratom withdraws seem worse than opioids. To kick start my adrenal glands I added rodolia rosa , American ginseng and ashwagnda. It really helped with my energy and mood. So far I‚Äôve functioned just as good if not better and needed no time away to withdraw. Stay tuned.",13,0

I am at day 37 and am eating only sweet potato, smoothies (loaded with goodness), tea and not much else really.

I have complained of this issue before to doctors - in fact- a few times over the past 4 years. They usually do not request tests because it goes away. I  have always suffered GI issues and food allergies but really take care of myself so it‚Äôs usually in check.

I want real tests but they never do them. I am hoping they do them when I talk to the doc tomorrow because I can‚Äôt live like this. I can‚Äôt wait it out...it is debilitating to say the least. Because my vitals are always normal they think I‚Äôm nuts. I am seeing if anyone has ever had anything similar? I also just needed to vent I suppose...I keep this all in most of the time but I needed to get it out there, so thanks. Makes me feel vulnerable to even talk about it.

Have wanted to be free of the habit for a long time. Over the weekend, I got terribly drunk, caught a nasty cold and used that as a launching pad. Additionally, a script for ambien was gone. So on the heals of months of shitty sleep, alcohol abuse, and habitual kratom use, I dug in an started.

It was horrible.  Not sure what to pin what on exactly, but I did not sleep for about 4 days. Restless legs were so bad that I thought I was going to saw them off. Emotionally, I was a complete mess:  incredibly confused, detached from a sense of reality (felt a few beats off each second), was irritable, and everything felt like it was leading to bleak nothingness. Above all else was a massive cloud of anxiety. I had to excuse myself from meetings, cancel plans with friend (singular), and stay in the dark. Three times a day I would have to go to the bathroom and literally lay down to try and collect myself. 

I stuck with it, not wanting to waste this first week.  Now, about 10 days in, I am relatively ok. Still slight case of the restless legs at night, still not entirely clear headed, and still some wobbliness when walking. Minor flushes of anxiety still creep in, but are entirely manageable. 

No alcohol, no ambien, and no kratom. I feel like a success. I still need to decide on meetings (AA); I feel I should go and be of help to someone else. 

Good luck to everyone trying to quit or are in the middle of the darkness.",34,0

The sleep is finally getting better. If any of you remember, I was the guy getting horrible hypnic jerks (where you suddenly jerk awake every time you're about to fall asleep) who didn't get any sleep for literally 7 days and was on the urge of psychosis. I'm very very happy to say that I'm getting about 6 hours of sleep per night now. Thank heavens.  


But when I wake up, before I've had breakfast or a shower or anything, I feel like absolute garbage. Feels like acute withdrawals all over again. Really cold but on the verge of cold sweats, every muscle aching, etc. It's a reminder every morning to how much I've screwed up my body/brain chemistry. And a reminder to keep going.  


At about lunch time though, I start to feel significantly better. This must be PAWS or the very edge between acutes and PAWS. Because throughout the day, I'll feel these sudden feelings of normalcy and like things are looking up. But then a couple hours later I might feel really bad again, muscles aching, etc. (but not as bad as in the morning).  


I'm having literally zero real urge to relapse. Sure, I get little bits of nostalgia for the feeling of kratom but relapsing is really not an option. I just want to feel like my old self again. That's the only goal. I won't risk ever having those crazy sleep issues and withdrawal symptoms again. I was literally hallucinating music playing 24/7! And had incredibly detailed waking dreams at some point. Was almost like a bad psychedelic experience.  


I'm having horrifying GI issues. I'm fairly sure they're caused by the kratom as I was having worsened GI issues (though I already had some GI issues on kratom, but was stable!) immediately after I quit kratom.  


All this to say... If you're thinking about using kratom long term... Don't. You really don't know how your body might react to a substance like this. And eventually, literally everyone will have kratom stop working as well and have to quit. It's inevitable. It's not something you can realistically take forever. If you like kratom, you'll use it very very occasionally. I can never take it again. I think I've had a more extreme reaction than a lot of people, but the fact that it's possible for me means it's possible for a lot of other people to react this way.  


Every day does get a bit better, and music is honestly keeping me going (shoutout to /r/audiophile and /r/headphones!).  


My goodness the nostalgia is insane though. Not just for remembering the feeling of kratom, but nostalgia for my life before kratom. I'm so ready to get back to normal. I'm feeling all these emotions coming back. I'm so glad I quit. I'm ready to repair all these relationships in my life. To really LIVE again.

One last thing this is in no particular order. I felt each book moved me forward significantly and while some stuff might seem repetitive. I would say you dont know the subject until you know you  CAN teach the subject.

1. The Craving Mind by Dr. Judson Brewer - this book dives into all addictions, from sugar, to smartphones, to drugs, to even thinking.

2.  Recovery : Freedom from our addictions by Russell Brand. - this books is a twist on the 12 steps that might work better for you then the original 12 steps.

3.  Unchain your Brain by Dr Daniel Amen - I'm currently 3/4 through this one. It's similar to the craving mind and goes deep scientifically PLUS gives really practical advice you can apply instantly. (Really enjoying this one)

4. 12 Stupid Things that mess up our Recovery by Allen Berger PhD - a shorter, easy and to the point book. Its 12 of the most likely reasons for relapse. 

5. 12 Smart things to do when the Booze and Drugs are gone by Allen Berger PhD - just like the other one, by dives into emotional Sobriety which has been HUGE for me. (This book for me showed me a blind spot I wasn't aware of that I had. EMOTIONAL SOBRIETY)

6. The predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely - this one has a few chapters on addiction and touches on it through our the book. I thought it does make the list because of that AND because it helped shed light on the ""I know what I should do but I keep doing what I shouldnt"" 

7. Breaking the Habit of being yourself by Dr Joe Dispenza - this one has a chapter on addiction and touches on it. I wanted to put it on the list because ""Your currently reality is based on your currently personality. And your personality is based on how you think, act, and feel. So if you can change your personality you can change your reality"" ---this book goes DEEP on that with practice tips you can apply today.",8,0

The first three days were highly unsuccessful and I realized I was going from dosing every six to every 12 hours. My goal was to make this semi smooth. I understand discomfort will be there, which it has, but bearable! On day four of last week, I decided to dose every 8 hours and the third dose still fell off the clock and it was enough to get me through the witching hour with the kids and myself! 

I have been dosing twice a day, 8 hours in between. Yesterday, though, I went 10 hours and felt fine. I noticed the clock after 9 hours and went another hour. 

I am hoping to keep that momentum and just listen to my body when I feel I do not NEED Kratom. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. Anyone looking to phase and has some insights, please post!!! Have a great Tuesday everyone and stay strong.",8,0

349,2020-02-11 07:54:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/f27x25/end_of_taper/,End of Taper,"*Hello Friends! This is long winded, I tried to break it up as best as possible so you can find what you really want to know. Taper schedule is at the bottom for those curious.*

Today marks the official end of my strict taper, though I decided Saturday that I was done and I'm currently at 72hrs CT.

**Basics - 29(M) | 7 years use | Max sustained dose: 50 GPD | No other addictions/medications**

**The PAST** |  If only I would have known what this stuff really was, that day I went to the gas station with a coworker and the clerk handed us free samples of caps, the coworker told me its great for depression and anxiety and energy and gave me his. At first it was, it seemed like a miracle, fast forward to now and I estimate I spent $40k in total on it. Could never do T&W and man are the caps expensive, yet convenient. At my worst it was $45 every other day for the last couple years.

I thought it was so harmless, I went on a vacation in 2016 thinking I don't need to take Kratom because this is going to be fun on its own, well we can add the cost of that vacation into the $40k figure as collateral damage because that was a disaster. Still didn't have the will or desire to quit though, just got home and got back after it. Later that year they banned it temporarily and I went through the same hell for a while, but once that was lifted I was on it again.

**The PRE-TAPER** | This was my third attempt at a taper. First time was August 2019, boredom did me in about 2/3 of the way. Second attempt was October 2019, the stress of the upcoming busy season was my downfall and I only made it about 1/4 of the way through. My dosing schedule up to Thanksgiving 2019 was 3 doses(14g,12g,12g) during the week and 4 doses(14g,12g,12g,12g) on the weekends. From Thanksgiving to Christmas I was at the full 50GPD across 4 doses every day. After Christmas things calmed down at work and I went back to my pre-Thanksgiving regimen.

**The BREAKING POINT** | That decrease of 12GPD during the weekdays sent me into withdrawals, and on the weekends when I would take the extra dose again I would get incredibly irritable. I spent two weeks like that and decided I needed to get a taper together and end it once and for all.

**The TAPER PLAN |** Spent several hours lining out my schedule in Excel. The big initial jump had already occurred, from 50 to 38GPD. It was unpleasant so I decided I wanted to have a more consistent taper; down 2g one day, 1g the next then plateau. I had to adjust this out to account for when I would run out and where I thought I might run into resistance (the mental battle of seeing less than 10 caps in a dose is real). Ended up settling on a 36 day taper, in hindsight I would have planned for my taper to end on a Friday as it makes more sense to face the physicals on the weekend. I printed a copy of the excel sheet with spaces for me to initial each dose and check off every aspect of my taper for accountability. I also wrote upcoming events that I wanted to face sober, reasons for quitting, and other more personal things to reference at each dose. The excel spreadsheet on my computer also allowed for me to self evaluate my symptoms(exhaustion/depression/irritability/insomnia) on a 1-10 scale and I charted that up against my decreasing GPD intake. No real revelations in that data, but it was motivating to me because I'm a nerd and I work in analytics. (The actual taper schedule is at the very bottom)

**The SUPPLEMENTS** | Vitamin C, multi vitamins, magnesium

**The SYMPTOMS** | Well, on the way down there isn't too much to report out of the ordinary. Mild depression, exhaustion, sleep was mostly regular, sneezing. Took only my first dose last Friday, things went well but I started getting very exhausted after about 12 hours. Woke up Saturday feeling okay, just tired, only thing out of the ordinary was, rather than sneezing, I would get to that point right before you sneeze and nothing...so annoying. I work a strange schedule so my first dose of Saturday was scheduled for 5pm and I took it and went about my night. Woke up Sunday, had to work to get the full sneeze but they were back with a vengeance after that. Pretty bad diarrhea, exhaustion and depression were mild. Same stuff Monday and so far today. I'd call it a moderate cold at this point. Cravings come and go, but I held a ceremonial F\*\*\* you flush to my remaining caps so I just wait it out. 

**The Recommendations** |  DON'T TINKER WITH THE TAPER! Put a lot of thought into it while you're making it and stick to it, it's only when you get to the last few days that you can make a change and that change should only result in a decrease or CT. Whether you have a moment of confidence or a moment of weakness, constantly messing with the taper will not end well. 

GET TO THE GYM! Seriously, I picked this up on my second taper attempt and it is hands down the best thing you can do. It helps with the mental game, getting you some dopamine. It helps with the physical game, tiring you out for sleep. It helps after you start seeing results... It just works. Getting your diet in check helps with the gym and with the WD. Lots of water, vegetables, quality food.

STAY ACTIVE IN THIS SUB! Coming on here and leaving nice comments or just giving a like to someone wasn't an entirely selfless act, it made me feel better too. Take everything with a grain of salt, everyone's experience is different but collectively there is a pattern of predictable outcomes. Don't freak yourself out from one post or get overly confident from another.

NEVER REWARD YOURSELF WITH AN EXTRA DOSE! It's not a reward, it's a setback. Cheat days are for the gym.

**The END of the Beginning** | At this point, only 72 hours out, I am cautious but optimistic. What happens from here on out is the great unknown, and I rely on those before me for the information they provided on what I will face in the coming weeks and months. I plan to post again after a week and then a month. Maybe more...maybe less.

If you've made it here, I sincerely thank you for reading and I hope I didn't forget anything but I check the sub daily so feel free to ask questions.

The point is, I fell back into kratom addiction a few months after getting out of treatment.  I knew it was wrong, but kept telling myself it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the other stuff I was doing.  Anyways, I quit again at the same time I stopped abusing my gabapentin prescription.  It was way harder than I thought it would be on my own, in a city where I barely know anyone and have no friends to help distract me.  (I moved across the country after rehab, which was also way harder than I thought it would be.)  A little over a month goes by, and I‚Äôm struggling with PAWS a lot.  I was so in my head and disassociating.  I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs part of the PAWS or just me.  I eventually went out and bought a bottle of whiskey, and had one drink.  Doing this made me hate myself even more, so I went and bought some kratom, and have been using it daily for about a month or so.    I also started abusing gabapentin and smoking weed again.  I also got drunk last week and hooked up with someone I really didn‚Äôt want to hook up with.  I don‚Äôt really have a problem with smoking weed, but my roommate made me sign a contract when I moved into my apartment that I won‚Äôt do it or she‚Äôll kick me out.  I keep telling myself that I‚Äôll kill myself if that happens, so I‚Äôm trying to be more careful...I recently lost my job due to sleeping in (probably because I took a shit ton of gaba the night before...I know I‚Äôm an idiot) and have been in bed all day almost every day since, unless I‚Äôm filling out job applications.

The lesson is know I now 100% sure why I should never try a real opioid in my life. I am 100% sure I would become addicted to it. Withouth a doubt. 

They say Kratom is a very mild opioid and I agree but still I find it particularly easy to maintain the habit of doing it daily. I used to do Kratom 2-3 times a week for the first months but once I switched to daily I couln¬¥t reduce it. Not because of physical dependency but because of having that crotch when you forget about your daily life it is way too attractive to the mind. I tried several times to return back to use it a couple of times a week, but I haven¬¥t been able at all to do it. My mind just finds excuses to keep using it daily.

That¬¥s why I have literally to throw it away because I see I¬¥ll never be able to use it occasionally, back when the habit wasn¬¥t that ""formed"" in my brain

It¬¥s time to let you go Kratom,

It was a pleasure to feel your unique qualities but,

I forgot to pack kratom and white knuckled my way through 72 hours. I had some anxiety and a few hours where I thought I had the flu. 

But when I finally got my hands on some kratom, I decided to reduce my dose even further. For reference, I started my taper a few weeks ago at 30gpd. When I can down here I was at 15-16gpd and putting a full day between dosages at time when I could. Well, last night I decided I‚Äôd try something crazy. 8g. And it worked. I got everything I wanted out of it, my nerves calmed down, my anxiety went away, and I‚Äôm now at about 27% of my original dose.

I‚Äôve tried cold turkey before and made it 3-6 days several times only to relapse. I‚Äôve got to say, I have more hope doing it this way than I‚Äôve had during any cold turkey attempt. I‚Äôve been using on and off for about a year and a half. So I know I‚Äôm not going through it as bad as some people, but being 5 and a half years sober from alcohol, it‚Äôs been a mixed bag of emotions having to go through addiction again.

I‚Äôm finally down to a level where I‚Äôm not embarrassed to admit it to anyone. I don‚Äôt feel sick from chocking the stuff down, and I‚Äôm just thrilled with the progress I‚Äôve made.

I‚Äôm going to keep up the fight. But at this point, I‚Äôm not in any hurry to get off completely as long as my dosage keeps dropping. I want to do this the right way instead of quickly. With the circumstantial issues in my life right now, I just can‚Äôt white knuckle it like I‚Äôve seen so many of you do. 

I‚Äôm planning on continuing to taper until I‚Äôm down to a gram and can comfortable go 3-4 days without any negative impacts then I‚Äôm cutting the cord. Maybe I‚Äôm being too nonchalant about this, but this feels right.

On another note, does anyone with success on a taper have any advice for me? Is there a point I should consider splitting my doses up? I usually dose in the evening in one sitting. 

Thanks again everyone for being an inspiration. This is such a deceptive product for some of us and I just happen to fall into the group of people who can‚Äôt have a healthy relationship with it.",9,0

Well, I think I bit off a bit more than I could chew last week when I tried to quit kratom as well as cease phenibut/adderall at the same time. I hadn't been using super high dose phenibut for a really long time like some people I have seen on here, but I had definitely been overusing it enough to have some  intense anxiety and depression upon stopping. That, coupled with the fatigue and amotivation from adderall and hell of a kratom CT quit was pretty unbearable. I took a lot of gabapentin and that helped me sleep a bit and not kill myself, but I gave in on day 4. I quit for 8 days in December and it was WAY easier, so I can only imagine that it was largely the combined WD/rebound effects that made last week so gnarly.

So now I've cut out phenibut and adderall entirely and have moderated my kratom use. Definitely a huge improvement but I used up all my gabapentin and flu/sickness excuses so now I'm facing a difficult situation. My significant other does not know about my addiction and can't know--he thinks I quit last year. I really wish I could open up to him and I plan to someday, after I've quit for a significant period of time. I don't think this is a good situation and I'm aware of the importance of honesty and having a support system, but unfortunately, this is the way it has to be right now.

I'm going home Wednesday for a week, and I don't think I can quit around my parents. I would just be miserable and make them miserable and confused, and I only get to see them a couple times a year. When I come back, my SO won't be home for another three days, so I could basically try to quit the last day or two of being with my parents and then by the time he gets back I'd be 4-6 days in and acutes would be starting to fade (hopefully). I could also taper for a few weeks, but tapering is even harder to hide than cold turkey what with the scales and timed dosing and stuff. I've also never successfully tapered to 0. My most successful quits have always been CT. Although, here I am, so there's that.

**TLDR**: Failed quit last week, tried to cease too many substances at once. Now I'm just left with kratom, but a less convenient quitting window than before.

**QUESTION:** Has anyone ever tried the method of just taking just enough to sleep and function essentially, but not a super structured taper? For me, I imagine this would start as a teaspoon in the morning and teaspoon or two throughout the night. I can't decide if this would just drag it out or not. I think people generally have the attitude that its better to full on CT or full on taper, but I'm just curious if anyone reading has attempted this method and how it worked out for them.",3,0

The problem isn't that people are incapable of quitting, though it's not as easy as you seem to think it is. Check out [r/quittingkratom](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/) to see thousands of people who were active users for years and now regret it. That's the problem. When you're addicted, you don't want to quit, and when you want to quit, it's hard. That's the very concept of addiction, and kratom is more addictive than caffeine or even nicotine. The dopamine rush tells you to keep going, and the euphoria is real with kratom. I've made horrible decisions while under the influence of kratom, because of the ""something good's going to happen to me"" mindset you experience while high on it, due to the dopamine receptor activity. It makes you more impulsive, it can worsen depression and anxiety over time, and there's plenty of other things that make it just plain evil. It's not a solution at ALL.",2,0

Id really appreciate this.,"So i was an opiate addict for almost 2 years. The ampunt I was taking was insane. Never heroin but i was hooked on ""legal heroin"". I was taking 90mg of Percocet or 100mg of hydrocodone or 70mg of oxy 2-3 times which ever one i coukd get it take 2-3 times a day at the age of 14 and 15 which is insane. I went cokd turkey off of my last dose of 80mg of hydros. Holy hell that was just 2 weeks of hell. But I eventually was completely clean for maybe 4 months. I was loving life. But I have a condition called eurlos danlos. Idk if thats how you spell it lmao. It basically causes chronic joint pain 24/7. I didnt want to go back to opiates so I looked online for a legal way to help myself and came across kratom. This was last summer btw. I eventually picked up a bag of the powder or tea as most people call it. I didnt know how much to take but online I found an actual kratom website suggesting to take 2 tablespoons. I took it and felt amazing. I did the method where you put it in you mouth and chug it down with some type of liquid. It eventually withing maybe 2 months tops became a every day thing. But the tolerance began to take effect. So i was taking more and more. Im now almost a year later taking 5 tablespoons a day at once. Which is 64 grams i think. I could be wrong. I'm now starting to grt bladder and liver sharp pains. I want to get off it but I cant. Ive became addicted. I didnt do enough research on the substance. Idk if anyone has taking more than me and has ideas to help me get off. Ive tried leaning off it. Take maybe half a tbs less every day. But maybe 3-5hrs after taking it my left leg becomes in pain and is restless just like when you start withdrawing off of opiates. I need to get off this badly. Its coasting so much aswell.

I've used kratom for 3 years now. In the end my dose was 4gx2 day. I managed very well to maintain my tolerance over the years that I figured out.

Kratom was the best thing ever that happened to me. It helped me managed my pain from ankylosing Spondylitis while I figured out how to manage my disease naturally. Yes I did just that after all my research. The medications I would have to take would shut down my immune system and I wasn't having that.

What prompted me to quit was when I realized I was taking kratom out of habit. During the past 8 months I was battling severe depression. Nothing made sense as I was doing everything right but then it occurred to me that I had a dependency on kratom to make me feel better before I could do anything. So with everything else eliminated there was only kratom left. Its been 30 days or so since I quit and by the 4 day I felt mentally better.  Now? I'm even better. I guess 60% better so I have a bit yet to go. 

With my personal experience is it took 2 years out of the 3 to have a negative effect on my dopamine system.

Or this was all a coincidence. Either way kratom is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who may also battle a life long cureless disease with caution in the long term of using kratom in the way  I experienced.

On a side note that over the last 30 days I experienced no withdrawals that I was aware of.

Nice to see it‚Äôs all the same esp re the frustrating and sudden compulsions to take just one more dose before really quitting.  It‚Äôs so seemingly innocuous and seemed so helpful at first. 

I developed a habit of consuming anywhere from 10-40g a day almost 2 years ago and the longer time passes the more reasons to quit I discover.

At first was just mood instability.  Was like I became bipolar between the euphoric 45 minute effects of a dose and then the time between doses.  Both an ex and best friend complained I seemed crazy and well both r no longer really in my life.  

Then after ex moved out I was depressed n barely eating n keeping my emotions in check with kratom and started noticing I was gaining weight.  Was bizarre as kept thinking I should be losing weight yet somehow was at my highest weight ever..  Then started noticing dreaded erectile dysfunction ... I think I was so hurt from breakup I basically just chose to ‚Äòfeel good‚Äô and gradually contribute more n more to that issue thus basically herbally castrating myself..

Then there‚Äôs the cost of course.  Instead of just buying a kilo I kept buying ounce packets from a seedy little smoke shop thinking each time it‚Äôd be my last one and acknowledging once I had the stuff at home I‚Äôd have no self control n keep taking one more dose every hour or so till I either finished it or dramatically flushed the remainder thinking that‚Äôd somehow help me quit.  Just made it more expensive as some days I‚Äôd just resist a few hours then return to gross little smoke shop to get one more dose.. I‚Äôve literally flushed thousands of dollars down the toilet as I neglect other realities in my life.

The past year is sorta blurry.  Been very productive on one hand but also aware of the level of manic crazy I‚Äôve embraced n how often I‚Äôve flipped out on strangers or massage clients ... it‚Äôs easy to say it‚Äôs better than drinking or benzos but of course I always know deep down my best self is one not perpetually numbing n dulling myself .

About a month ago I started noticing my hair seemed to be thinning!  I‚Äôm 42 and have been noticing hair receding for years but seems like in past 2 months went from looking pretty good to it getting MUCH more noticeable.  I‚Äôve read others complain about this yet as I add it all up I‚Äôm baffled I keep trotting back to the damn smoke shop for just one more dose.  Even as I type this I feel that urge to do so.  To take just one more then blah blah blah

Figured writing here could be helpful as my efforts to find accountability have failed.  Turned to one friend, an md, who basically had started kratom to stop cocaine and alcohol use and basically thought I was being ridiculous to question the magic of kratom..

Still, beyond the crazy, ED, $$$ and hair loss also noticed a lot more aches n pains.  Started feeling ‚Äòold‚Äô .. plus despite the initial euphoria I find after 45 minutes I‚Äôm just chasing the proverbial white rabbit n never feeling great.  I get super moody and bitchy and have even yelled at my sweet, old cat for no real reason.

Oh yeah, constipation.  Once I dose I basically just get all blocked n as day progresses get gassy and uncomfortable.  It‚Äôs honestly gross and I‚Äôm frustrated as even after tapering for months it‚Äôs like every time I take a dose I‚Äôm opening door to total relapse.  Even when I resist and think I‚Äôm almost off it I take that last taste n suddenly spend a day binging.

Plus, quitting gets intense.  I‚Äôm suddenly in a horrible mood with flu symptoms and feel exhausted yet sleep terribly.  About a year ago I managed to stay off it for about a week and tbh after just a couple days I recall feeling great .  

I know I‚Äôm blocking my growth and ability to connect with others and build a good life yet like many of you quitting has proven WAY more difficult than I‚Äôd ever imagined.  Each time I do stop for a day tho I always notice it wasn‚Äôt that difficult n I think that alone enables me to keep putting it off.

I found kratom a year and a half ago to get off alcohol. Went on the kratom sub for research not realize they just ban/delete anyone that has anything negative to say about it. I am up to between 30-40 gpd now. I have realized that what they said on the kratom sub is all false. This IS a drug. It DOES get you high, and the withdrawals ARE very severe. I have been getting up the nerve for the last couple of months to try and quit but holy hell are the WDs bad. 

Its gotten to the point were every morning when i wake up im already in WD. I literally rely on this drug to feel any sort of happiness. It comes down to me taking kratom, feeling euphoric for 45 mins to an hour, then just waiting around for my next dose to feel happy. Idk if thats permanent. I am scared i will never be able to feel naturally happy again. I have so much fear around quitting i have convinced myself that the few hours a day of happiness are better than never feeling happy at all. 

I can't lie to myself. I am scared as hell of quitting. The longest i have been is around 24 hours and the cold sweats, body comfort, RLS, Irritability and unable to sleep seems like to much to do for days and days.

I dont know what to do. I am scared and i dont know were to turn. But i cant keep waking up feeling like shit. I cant keep relying on this dumb plant to feel healthy. Idk were to turn. I am not sure if there is anything i can do to ease the WD. I can't taper because every morning i feel like shit and ALWAYS take my full dose. I am addicted. I dont know how to get out.

Now, I‚Äôm on day two CT and I‚Äôm in bed with aches and pains. I‚Äôve gone this long before regularly and usually have a runny nose, but never before have I reacted this way. I‚Äôm supposed to be her date to a Gala and instead I‚Äôm stuck in bed. 

For what it‚Äôs worth I tapered from 25gpd down to 15gpd.

So the question, is this withdrawal or did I get the flu while traveling and putting myself through a ridiculously rigorous Muay Thai class?

My experience,"Can‚Äôt believe after a two year run in with this stuff I‚Äôve been off it for 68 days! Been off weed for 55 of those days. Here are some rambling thoughts that I hope may help some of you! 

I‚Äôd be lying if I said it‚Äôs been easy, but the only way I‚Äôve been able to do it is by seeking out support. Seriously, don‚Äôt do this alone if you can avoid it! 

In the past 68 days I‚Äôve made some real close friends who‚Äôve gone through similar things, recorded a lot of music and learned a ton about myself. That‚Äôs been one of the best parts about this journey. Rather than sitting in my room alone getting high, I‚Äôve been going out and meeting other likeminded people. 

The most difficult thing has been feeling all the emotions I used to feel 10 years ago before I became a daily stoner and then ultimately a daily Kratom user. I have to learn to actually live with my emotions. Even though I‚Äôm 29 years old in many ways I feel like I did when I was 17 (although I‚Äôve obviously matured in many other ways). Even though I‚Äôm almost 30, I feel younger and more capable than ever, as I feel I‚Äôve been granted a new lease on life, but at the same time I feel a lot of those same emotions I ran from for so long flooding back. 

I think most of us will relapse if we don‚Äôt do some hard work on ourselves. This addiction is not just about the physical withdrawals- it‚Äôs about our coping mechanisms and (or lack of coping mechanisms). Many people I know who‚Äôve been sober for a long time have truly learned to cope with their emotions without a chemical crutch. Spend some time really sober if you can. No alcohol, no weed, nothing. Learn to meditate. Seek out a group like AA, SMART Recovery, Lifering... whatever works for you. 

From a purely physical side, it‚Äôs been hard to come to terms with the fact that shoveling powder in my mouth for two years probably did have a profound impact on my brain chemistry. The acutes are long gone and I don‚Äôt feel any noticeable PAWs, but the reality of being totally sober can be overwhelming at times. Perhaps that is PAWs? 

Anyways, thanks for this sub! Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd be sober by now without it.",8,0

Per day on average for roughly 2 years. 12 days in to quitting CT.,"41 year old male . I would say I‚Äôm of average Health overall. No major disease or major Psychological issues I‚Äôve been diagnosed with. 
10 years ago I had a roughly 8 month battle with prescription opiates of which at my worst I was using approx. 180-240 mg. Nasally of Oxycodone HCI per day (6-8 x 30mg oxycode hci per day).
The only reason I mention all of the above is because I realize that all of these factors play into each and every individuals personal detox scenarios and length of opiate abstinence syndrome and protracted opiate withdrawal syndrome. 

My question is to any individuals out there with a similar scenario to mine both in terms of past opiate use, health and Kratom use, is in regards to insomnia?

All the acute withdraw symptoms where somewhat mild compared to my oxy withdraws and passed within 5-7 days. But the insomnia is driving me mad!
12 days into quitting Kratom CT and I have had VERY little sleep in these 12 days. I am talking maybe a total of 7-8 hours total in 12 days!! ‚ÄòMaybe 30-40 minutes sustained at any one time. Most nights with Zero sleep it seems.

Please if anyone out there has experienced the same
It would be nice to know how long this lasted until you experienced natural relief? I am trying VERY hard not to turn to prescription sleep aids or for that matter other illegal or ‚ÄúGray‚Äù area remedies for relief.

By the way Benadryl, Melatonin, NyQuil and the like have zero effect on me even in large doses.
I even bought CBD tincture which would qualify as 
‚ÄúGray area ‚Äú but sold over the counter everywhere in my state with also zero effect with sleep. 

I understand at this point in order for me to be successful is to keep my head up and put one foot in front of the other day by day but for THE LOVE OF GOD!!! How long should I expect to be in this insomniac state??

Iv'e used kratom for 4-5 years and used to take breaks but in the last 2-2.5 years I have used 8-16gpd without taking a SINGLE break, even for a day. I am 7 weeks out now after a looooong taper and had only minor acute withdrawals but around the 1 month mark I had some new symptoms appear that I didn't even experience while taking kratom. For one thing I have acne, but its a type of acne I have never experienced before. Had perfectly clear skin my whole life until taking kratom but while I was on it I would get really bad cystic acne, usually on my cheeks. I have taken short breaks over my 4 years of use and it's always cleared up during those breaks but never been off long enough to get the one month mark until now. My skin cleared up per usual this time but then around 1 month I started getting small skin colored bumps all over my entire face. It's like the opposite of acne I would get while taking kratom and its in places I never have had acne before like my forehead, jawline, and chin?? I do SO MUCH to prevent acne /take care of my skin because of the cystic pimples I would get while on kratom and I never had any acne before kratom, so I feel like this new type of acne could be related to the w/d or readjustment period. Has anyone experienced anything like this after coming off for awhile / did it go away? At around the same time this acne started showing up I also started getting visible blue and or purple veins in random spots all over my body. None are bulging out or anything and doctor says they look ""normal"" but I have never been able to see any veins on my body other than my wrists and now they are literally everywhere. My friends have even jokingly commented that I look like I'm ""dying"". Can't find anything on the internet that even resembles the vein symptoms (even outside of kratom forums) except for the visible veins pregnant women sometimes experience, and I am definitely not pregnant / have not started new birth control. Has anyone ever had either of these symptoms / have any insight on if and how they could be related to kratom. I am extremely freaked out about the veins as they keep getting more visible/new ones keep popping up and I am afraid they will turn into varicose veins or are a sign of a serious vascular problem. I have another dr. appointment monday but keep getting panic attacks over it and have definitely developed health anxiety (over these symptoms and other things). I am only 22 so I am really heartbroken over the fact that my whole body looks so unhealthy right now. Also heartbroken over the acne as I thought based on past experience that quitting kratom would clear it up. Part of what was driving me to quit kratom so much was the negative effects it had on my appearance (sorry I'm vain) and it has been so discouraging that even at 7 weeks out I easily look less healthy and my appearance has declined since using kratom. I'm not going to go back to it but need some support cause I'm feeling pretty hopeless right now and incredibly anxious that something is seriously wrong with my health :(",2,0

You served your purpose, but now it's time that you go...""","Hi, I'm desperately in need of some encouragement to do this...to FINALLY QUIT KRATOM!!! I can't beat this monster on my own! 

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this :)

This has been a long time coming...I AM quitting Kratom in about a month! I'm CHOOSING to do this and I am determined to stay POSITIVE through it!! I've been wanting to quit for awhile but am scared of the withdrawals and how hard it's going to be to take care of my very active and rambunctious 2-YEAR-OLD while feeling like crap.

*A little history that I think is relevant:

I am a recovering opiate/heroin addict ( *3 years* clean today! :D). But for most of that I've been using Kratom pretty heavily and consistently every day, for about 2.5 years. I'm not promoting Kratom in any way. It was a stepping stone to a better life for me, from where I was and where I am today. But it wasn't the end game. 

***It served it's purpose, but now I'm ready for it to be out of my life for good!!!!!***

**My biggest problem I would say is:
I already feel SUPER bad when I take less Kratom. But what makes it worse is that I was semi-recently (6 months ago) prescribed meds for my ADHD, and when I try not to take Kratom, the meds make me feel completely awful! Like all the bad side effects appear and the benefits vanish. But I don't want to stop taking that too, at the same time. I still need the focus & motivation from the meds to help me function, or I'm going to be COMPLETELY out of commission! That's simply not an option.   

Has anyone had experience with this? And if so:
1) Did you continue taking your ADHD meds while going through Kratom withdrawal? 
2) Did that awful feeling go away after withdrawals were gone? 
3) In the end, were you able to continue taking meds without bad side effects? 

I just hope that I'll be able to keep taking my meds at least after the withdrawals are gone because I have severe ADHD and really need them to even halfway function!

I'm just asking for any personal experience that anyone might have. Thanks!",8,0

Wow, what a ride this has been!  I'm 90 days clean today from Kratom and 226 days free from alcohol and everything else.  Honestly though, I feel like I didn't really get ""sober"" until 90 days ago when I quit Kratom.  That stuff had me thrown for a loop.  

I'm not gonna lie.  It hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows.  The first month was miserable. Month 2 I was so excited to not be having the withdrawals anymore I was on a pink cloud for the first few weeks.  However, since then I've been all over the place.  I wanted to drink horribly bad at times. I experienced EVERYTHING again and I had urges at times to go back, but I won't and I can't.  I don't ever want to be addicted to anything ever again.  It was such a nightmare.  It scared me because I LOVED it so much. It scared me to think I would never be free of it.  But I made it and I am here to tell you IT GETS BETTER.

At 90 days I feel like I have finally forgotten what it was like to be on it.  It's no longer fresh. I feel completely adapted to being sober again. My biggest fear was that I wouldn't be able to run as fast without it.  But I am here to tell you friends....you can do anything you set your mind to.  I am determined to race my next marathon faster than my last one and this one I'm doing it KRATOM FREE.  I did a faster speed workout today than I did before with Kratom so I am all the proof you need!!  Look what I did today drug free!!  

Don't doubt for a second that you can't overcome this drug. Just rip the band aid off and be done with it.  Life gets better everyday sober and I feel stronger than I have probably ever.  

Much love ya'll!

Before I would just take some kratom and it would stimulate me into doing things, but now I lack that extra push, and I'm left feeling lazy and sad. I don't have many motivating factors in my life, and things around me are becoming progressively more disorganized or messy, like my car for instance. The bigger the mess, the harder it feels to get up.

It's never been this bad for me. I don't whole-heartedly blame the withdrawals for this, but they're certainly contributing. I'm considering trying a stimulant out like phenylpiracetam for a boost or something, and I don't want to hop on a SSRI.

Now I had WDs everyday for the last couple months of varying degrees. I used kava tinctures and cannabis to manage WDs.

Been taking doses at 8pm and tonight I will skip the dose and take something to help sleep (trazadone or tizanidine). Just wanted to post my results so far for anyone thinking of making the jump from double digits grams per day to single ones. It's really not bad at all.

I used to cup the sinkwater in my hands after popping two capsules onto my tongue, suck in the chlorine scent and shudder as they slipped down my throat.

Every time I smelled that bathroom, I would quiver; an involuntary cringe would run down my spine. It was like my body knew I was turning the key and clicking the lock of my own cell each time the green-tea scent mixed with the sink water in my nose.

Those capsules kept me still, told me moving forward was wrong. They were choking me slowly, like invisible plastic wrap clinging to my skin. 

I'd walk out of the bathroom and breathe a sigh of momentary relief. I didn't want you to touch me, though; not until a half hour later, when the shivering, the cold, the lying became worth it: fifteen minutes of glowing relief.

And then the plastic wrap would tighten again, tell me *that's all for today...but just wait until tomorrow. We'll let you loosen up again.*

I was okay with this for a long time.

But your sink water no longer makes me quiver. Your bathroom isn't cold anymore. I don't take secrets with me behind closed doors now. I've unwrapped the plastic and felt my real skin for the first time in a while.

I missed myself a lot. I missed you a lot, too. We'll have to re-learn how to love each other, and I'll have to re-learn how to love myself. But I'm getting better at it. I'm done shivering in silence, gulping down my feelings, hiding from you and myself.

I'm sorry I hurt you. But I'm finally ready to right those wrongs. We can all be stronger than we were in the past. We may have done some damage, but that never means we can't move forward. Let's leave kratom behind and follow our own individual beacons of hope for the future.",119,0

Laughing way harder (was on insta using dumb filters to alter my face and was laughing so hard I was crying) I haven‚Äôt done that in a while. Anyway, if you‚Äôve seen my posts before, you probably know I used to drink. A lot. I worked in the bar industry and that was just what we all did. Helped mask my anxiety and I can tell you bartending is high anxiety. I had panic attacks constantly the first year or so of it but I fought it (usually with booze) as I got older I really hated how I drank every day but it was a vicious cycle. I wasn‚Äôt blacking out or like going insane with it,  but I definitely didn‚Äôt know how to just stop. Kratom helped me in that regard. Anyway, my parents are full blown drug addicts. Severe. My mom was hooked on percs for ten years of my adolescence, my dad loved crack, booze and graduated to heroin a few years ago but he‚Äôs clean now and my mom is in prison for meth sales. I‚Äôve had this constant fear as a child I was going to end up like them. I was convinced I‚Äôd be an addict no matter what because my parents were. I was talking to my boyfriend last night (I had a really rough day, so I had a glass of wine and then stopped. I don‚Äôt care to drink anymore, it‚Äôs so weird) and I go, ‚ÄúI feel like Kratom reset my brain somehow with drinking. I can just have one and be like meh, I‚Äôm done.

You‚Äôre older now and want different things in life and that‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre too hard on yourself and constantly tell yourself you‚Äôre going to be like you‚Äôre parents but you‚Äôre not.

It started with pills like many, then I met kratom when I was trying to get clean after a relapse. 

Kratom is just a lie , honestly it would be a lot easier to just pop pills or smoke some opium than to take this shit .  It completely destroyed my stomach, and had a lot of effects I didn‚Äôt even realize until I quit for 14 days just two weeks ago . 

This wasn‚Äôt my first time going through withdrawal from kratom but this was the first time I intended to actually quit . the WD is just as bad as oxy tbh (just my experience ) .

After I got out of the first 7 days , chills, rls had faded away , I still felt sick . Unable to do anything , no interest in wanting to do anything but bored out of my mind . At day 14 I was still feeling weak, anxious , unable to function at a normal level . 

I got scared , I feel as if I‚Äôm never going to get over this . On day 15 I had to get some shit done (considering I‚Äôve been MIA, sick af for the last weeks) . And honestly felt as if I had to get some kratom , foolishly I did ... I‚Äôve used for the past 4 days . 


I‚Äôm not sure what to expect tomorrow when I stop again , I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs going to be unpleasant , but unsure where it will land me on the WD scale . 
The good thing is that I actually feel the kratom now as opposed to it being a requirement to feel just normal . Which is a good sign that my brain has healed a little ?

What do you guys think ? And honestly just some love and encouragement from y‚Äôall would be much appreciated. Thanks for your time üôè",1,0

Emotionally things are a helluva lot easier with less weird ups and downs. Things are certainly smoother, but every once in a while I'll have a bad day. Or something will feel off... I think it's nothing abnormal, everyone has these.

Overall it's my second time where I was able to stitch a few months together. I rarely think about Kratom, probably because my relapse after five months of sobriety was so nasty and was so difficult to quit.

Exercise is a must. I do some sort of a workout almost daily. Nothing crazy, but at least get the heart rate up for an hour and work up some sweat. 

Quitting this crap was scary, but life is so much better now ... It's like someone pulled me out of a hamster wheel in which I've been stuck for months. It's simply great to be able to look forward to something other than that next dose. 
At the same time it's important to be able to move on after relapse. I was feeling so guilty... And for what? Rather I should have taken some action. Hopefully another lesson learned.

Relapsed after having 5 months clean. Life events girl left, financial impact I couldn‚Äôt handle, stress for work. The girl thing was tough we met in rehab and she started pursuing me after we left rehab. Long story short I fell in love she just wanted sex. After I told her I loved her she put the brakes on the relationship. Then a week or two later we would hook up again giving me hope. The final time she ended it after 4 yo-yos. I picked up the opms gold. 

Was good only 1 shot a day at first to get throw a fairly stressful job.  After 2 weeks I was picking up 4-6 a day starting in the morning until night it became my only focus for 2 months. I spent a small fortune, well it was a small fortune for me. I got kicked out of my outpatient rehab.

Thankfully I was honest with my family and took off time of work. I‚Äôm also a severely depressed individual while I had used kratom Before in large amounts I was all about my big 4 weed, booze, DMT, kratom. Occasionally roxies or coke. I had been really into coke/crack 5‚Äì7 years ago. I‚Äôm getting off topic though. The depression and anxiety are so exacerbated by the use and I never dealt with it in rehab learned how to handle stress like spending half my savings on a car emergency, or having a woman I loved leave me. Well plenty have left me but I always turned to drugs and alcohol my true loves so it didn‚Äôt matter. But she was the first I loved sober. First person I had sex with sober. So that emotional connection was intense, and addicting.

But here I am on day 3 of CT can‚Äôt sleep or all I do is sleep. No energy. No libido, haven‚Äôt gotten an erection in probably 2 months. Crying over every stupid mistake I‚Äôve made in the past which is a lot. Considering I‚Äôve been using for 20 years. 2 decades under the influence. The withdrawal is close to being dopesick, diet dopesick I call it. It‚Äôs not as bad as coming off dope or the stronger pills but it‚Äôs pretty fucking close. 

I‚Äôve been trying to get back into the psychiatric hospital I went to originally for rehab. Get my antidepressants, anxiety meds straight. Enroll in a DBT program to temper my catastrophic thinking.

My last drink was around 5 years ago, however I still am always looking for that magic new pill or something that will give me a nice buzz with no side effects.  I have kicked at least 10 opiate withdrawals; 2 in rehab, and 8 on my own.  What I am saying here is that I have experience and an addiction disease with drugs and alcohol.

When I first heard about Kratom, it seemed pretty harmless.  My disease took over my rationale and told me that since it was legal and you could buy at any smoke shop that it should be pretty safe.  My first dose was about 2.5 years ago.  I took 3 grams, and I felt great!  I couldn't believe it.  I had a boost of energy, and a mild euphoric feeling to boot.  I thought I found the perfect supplement (DRUG) for me.  I felt like it gave me motivation to conquer the world.  Long story short, I went from taking 3 grams a day to around 125 grams a day in the span of like 2.5 years.  It ramped up fast and it got really bad.  I am afraid to look at my credit card statements, but I believe I spent around $10,000.00 total on Kratom.  This addiction can get very expensive.  But it didn't matter.  I needed it, or at least my disease was telling me that I needed it.  And who knows?  This shit that I was buying was not regulated and could have tainted with other addicted chemicals.  

Its been a little over a month since my last dose.  Its been really hard, but like many of the other commentators say, it gets just a little better every day.  The withdrawal is not as painful and acute as a typical opiate withdrawal, but with Kratom seems to drag on and on and on.  Mainly leaving me with some added stress, anxiety and depression.  I write this to just warn people if they are truly have an addiction problem, this drug can be very dangerous.  Just be very careful.  However, if you are not an addict, then I'd say...  your lucky, but still proceed with caution.",13,0

Everyday is getting better...even if it's just 1% a day, I'm grateful for the tiny wins.

I think the thing that messes a lot of us up...especially those who have been addicted to other substances as well...is that we expect to be completely back to normal by now.  But with kratom it's very different...for some reason this takes a lot longer than most of us imagined.

That's why this quit time I told myself that I am giving myself permission to suck at life for the first 90 days...hell I don't care if it even takes the rest of this year.  This has been a tough pill for me to swallow because I run multiple businesses and have a couple youtube channels and have a lot of responsibilities in my life...but I've decided that it's time to be selfish and put my own needs first before the worlds.  I don't care if my businesses suffer or if my productivity tanks...this year is about me and finding myself again.  I felt like I had lost my soul to kratom and I'm sure many of you can relate...I wasn't sure if I'd ever be able to quit again, every time I tried to quit the withdrawals buckled me to my knees.   Fortunately this time somehow someway my fighting spirit has kept me strong, but it aint be easy.

Somedays are better than other.  Monday was day 17 and I was mess...felt all emotional and like total shit.  Then yesterday on Day 18 I felt amazing...then this morning I woke up crushed a great workout had a productive first half of the day, but now by 1pm I'm feeling lethargic unmotivated again....but it's all good.   I'm in this for the long haul.

And the the thing that I keep thinking about is that I know that by day 30 I will be better than I am now...and by day 60 I will be better than at day 30...and at day 90 I will be better than at day 60...and at day 365 I will a totally different man.

Stay strong friends, and just keep focused on the long haul...this too shall pass...give yourself permission to suck at life for the first couple of months...sometimes you gotta take two steps backwards in order to take just one step forward.  If you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but no matter what just keep moving forward...be easy on yourself, forgive yourself for being human and having weaknesses.

Started out barely quarter of a pill a day then to half a pill then full pills. Fought that CT for awhile then finally remembered kratom and how I've read it's helped people get off opiates.

I've gotten off fent a few times last year one solid time I just randomly woke up and felt myself didn't feel the need to immediately take kratom sure enough that following payday I relapsed. This was 2 months ago. Well I am now officially 4 weeks clean I'd say 5 I bough a pill bought it was so cut it didn't even really get me high. But I could still feel w/d when I woke up so I put it all on that I fucked up and can't let myself slip. But now that It has been 4 weeks nd still feel awful. It's def the kratom.. sucks all I have is little bit left in the bags from before so I'm kinda tapering. Just eating qaurterish tbs when I have to fubction for life. Doesn't do much but it eases the body load. Sucks cause my car broke down and now I'm burning my vaca in supposed to use for Florida that I already paid for and trying to immediately find a new job locally...

I have spent a ridiculous amount of money on it in the past years, and I think it is starting to affect my urinary tract, which I got checked out and was attributed to ""gas"" but the doctor didn't seem to know what was going on, which tells me it's the thing I didnt tell her about.

I have no clue how much I am taking on average right now, as I dont keep track, but it must be close to an oz per day. I take somewhere between 6 and 10 grams 3 to 4 times per day, sometimes more.

This morning I went with 6. My plan as of now is to drop my normal dose by 1 gram each day. So today I will take 6 grams x 3 times = 18 grams. Tomorrow I would take 5 grams √ó 3 times = 15 grams, etc. I am concerned this might be to fast considering the amount and time I've been taking it, but i have nothing to compare it to. 

I would also like to know what the withdrawal is like from people who have actually gone through it, instead of getting my information from internet advocacy groups from either side, which will either exaggerate or play down the withdrawal to suit their narrative. I already know of the sniffles/tears and weird body feeling from missing doses, but I don't think I've gone a full day without Kratom since close to when I started, so I dont know how bad it gets.

Thank you in advance and I would appreciate some suggestions in how to best taper from where I am now. How long to drag it out, how quickly to drop the dose, etc.

Edit: I would also like to know about any OTC supplements/vitamins that would help. Currently I've been taking magnesium as I've read that it lowers your tolerance, so I dont know whether it would be beneficial to continue that or not. I also have some potentiators like tagamet and cumin/black pepper extract laying around, and I assume I may as well throw these away but I don't know if there's a way they would help",3,0

It's not really an organized taper, but more of me making a conscious effort to skip doses until I get closer to a number where the large jumps become problematic. I was probably at around 40-45 gpd about a week and a half ago. I am now down to about 21 gpd spaced out among three 7 gram doses. I feel very little, well anything as it pertains to withdrawals...except...right before I drift off to sleep, I jolt awake with a sudden (albeit short lived) panic attack. Like, I feel like I'm about to be killed panic. I'm not really thinking of anything in particular and can't pinpoint what it is that's even terrifying me. This will usually happen 7-8 times per night before I finally fall asleep, and it does NOT reoccur when I wake up in the middle of the night (which is often).

This is my second time quitting the stuff. The last time I quit I suffered from all sorts of stuff. I was also 20 pounds overweight during that quit and it was a quit that had 500 mgs of hydrocodone a month mixed into the equation. So I expect this quit to be easier as I am healthier (I work out 4 times a week minimum \[a lingering gym injury is what caused me to take up kratom again\]) and don't have the second drug in this mix.

460,2020-02-04 17:03:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/eyy08j/starting_ct_today/,Starting CT today,I did kratom liquid OPMS shots starting at just one a day. I did it because I wanted to quit the pain pills and at first it really was a huge relief to stop taking pills. I thought to myself every day it‚Äôs better to do kratom than to be doing pills. Very quickly within about 2 weeks I was doing it every day. It made me feel like I had something to look forward to for work given I worked 3PM-11PM shift from Thursday-Tuesday. The loss of having a social life and not having friends to have around to keep me in check made me start using. By the time i realized that‚Äôs it was a year of using the liquid shots I was using 2-3 a day. I got married and moved in with my wife this past July and that‚Äôs when I realized it was pretty hard to keep justifying spending $45 dollars at a smoke shop every single day. So in September I started using the powder because it lasted longer and I didn‚Äôt have to go to the store every day. In January I was up to a 3oz bag being finished every 2-1/2 days. And that was going on for about 2 months. My wife caught onto it eventually and confronted me and found where I kept my bag and was devistated. Because of the person she is she forgave me and said we will move forward but that can not be a part of my life anymore. To which I went 1 day with not doing any. I went to work feeling groggy and tired and at night was very restless with the legs. I bought some more with cash so she wouldn‚Äôt see a paper trail. But I stopped dosing every 2-3 hours and only dosed about 5grams in the morning and right before I got off work as I was keeping a stash at work so I wasn‚Äôt withdrawing at work. So it was somewhat of a taper but not the best way to taper probably. I would also pop off a liquid shot here and there because it was quick and I didn‚Äôt have to bring it home I could just take it and throw it away. Yesterday I went 24 hrs without any but when I got up for work today I bought a liquid shot and took it so I would have some energy at work. That was at 7am. Now that my schedule has changed and I am living with my wife my urge to quit is so intense that I am officially marking today as day 1 of no more(7am being the starting point) I‚Äôll be at 24 hours tomorrow morning. I‚Äôve built up the withdrawals in my mind as being horrible and it‚Äôs gonna suck. Also this morning after taking the shot I felt so horrible emotionally and my conscious made me open up to my wife and tell her that I snuck a shot this morning. That was a very very big step for me to come clean to her before she noticed and just finally getting it out there to someone else other than just the thought cycle in my head of justifying a reason to cave into a craving and then feeling bad about it after it wears off. But I know it won‚Äôt be as bad as withdrawing from pain killers like I did at least 5 times from 2016-2018. I know it‚Äôll be still a little rough but I know it can‚Äôt be as horrible as oxy withdrawals were(or at least that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm justifying to myself that the withdrawals won‚Äôt be as bad as I‚Äôm fearing) I‚Äôm posting to join the community and finally say out loud to people that I‚Äôm quitting today.

This last one reminds me of one of the reasons why I am doing this in the first place. 
Decrease caffeine....detoxing baths are amazing.... https://home.wholetones.com/ Wholetones is healing music that anyone interested should check out (link above).... https://donovanhealth.com/courses/...Donovan Sound Solutions has helped as well. Just the breathing exercises calms me when I am so anxious waiting for my next dose....find something/anything to distract you. Scream into a pillow if you have to. Cry in a closet if you need to. Get the negative out of your body, no matter the form (obviously being safe and courteous to others). When I feel the B‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢T‚Ä¢C‚Ä¢H coming on, I remove myself from my family for a few moments (hence the bath) and try to recalibrate myself. Anyway, I hope some of this helps. Sex works too!

I figured it was a decent way to perk up and dial in on tasks when I had a busy day ahead and didn't want to procrastinate. I would maybe have a few grams a month and would go many weeks without it completely. This was basically how I was from 2015 to most of 2017. I developed a bit of a drinking problem that gave me a lot of concern towards the autumn of 2017; and so I began using kratom regularly to break the alcohol addiction. So one addiction gave way to a new addiction. 

2018 began and I was using kratom regularly, about 10-20gpd almost daily. In 2019 I probably averaged around 18-25gpd. And it wasn't until December 2019 that I started to grow concerned with my usage. I began thinking of what goals and resolutions I wanted to set for 2020 and I realized that I hadn't gone a single day of 2019 without using kratom. At that point I tried formulating a plan to quit. And so here I am. January was mainly for trying to get my gpd down and now my goal is to taper weekly until I get adjusted to very low amounts and then just jumping off completely.

For this first week of February, I'm staying at 12gpd, then the next few weeks will be 9gpd, 6gpd, then 4gpd; at which point it will be March 1 and I plan to be at a point where I stop. I have a long line of addiction in my family, and I'm not trying to remain on that path. I am fairly health conscious aside from this one thing; in the gym frequently and eat pretty decently. But I worry about what other health issues this can cause to my organs. I imagine this has many ill effects on the liver and kidneys just as heavy drinking does. I'm really looking forward to getting away from this. Also the extra money I'll save will be a huge incentive. So here I am at the end of one battle and the beginning of the next one.",2,0

Thats what calmed me. I fought it and it turned into a long battle with eating disorders of every kind with brief years of stability. 

After I had my son (who is now 4) I fell deeply into post-partum depression and anxiety. I started drinking daily to cope. Eventually I was given a prescription for lorazepam which helped me calm myself into a blissfully uncaring state. I quickly started taking way too many a day. All I wanted to do was sleep, my husband was scared and I would just forget everything that happened the days before. After the initial great relief of not feeling I started to wean down. When I was almost off of it I couldn‚Äôt take the withdrawal that came with jumping off completely. It felt like hell. While researching how to combat lorazepam withdrawal I came across some information on kratom and how helpful it was. I decided to give it a try. When I first tried it, it honestly felt like bliss.

I've been using kratom on and off for about 4 years. More so in the last 2. As many people have, I got introduced to opiates by my doctors some years back. Went from 40 mg oxy's to a full blown H addiction. Those were the darkest years of my life. Thankfully I had a support system. My ex-wife and mother were there to help me, as I kicked the habit. Kicked the addiction CT, and went sober for about a decade. 

Then I relapsed. Relapsed HARD. For a second time, my ex and family members helped out but clearly they weren't going to put up with this ever again. Managed to kick the habit once more and was clean after that, other than consuming cannabis.

Due to circumstances out of my control, Me and my ex split up, causing me to fall into a big depression. By this time, I happened to find a kratom/kava bar where I was introduced to kratom tea. I always used to T&W or took caps. It turned into my escape, a crutch of sorts. Once a week turned into a daily habit..... Now I'm buying 100gs bags and making the tea at home, and going thru that in about 4 days. I didn't realize what I was getting myself into. Always read about kratom being natural, minor wd's symptoms, etc. Until I started getting that ""all-too-familiar"" symptoms when in WD's from opiates. I never thought of finding myself here, after all I went thru.

I want to quit so bad. But then I read about your stories and how hard and difficult it has been for everyone to quit, and get scared. I tried quitting CT last week and lasted 36 hrs before giving in....

I pray that I can find the willpower and courage to quit soon. Just don't know where to start. Im scared of the wd's and letting people find out I am once again addicted to some opiate-like substance. I'm afraid of my chronic pain coming back with a vengeance... But right now I feel like such a failure!

Thank you for every success story, and for all the help you guys provide by just posting your experiences. Your stories give me hope. I find myself reading tour stories often, and I too want to be able to say ""I'm free!"" 

Until then, I'll keep lurking around here, trying to motivate myself to quitting this crap once and for all!",17,0

First time really posting for me but want to thank everyone for the support I've gotten just reading others post. First let me start by saying I don't have any history of drugs of any kind other than maybe Tylenol up until I started taking kratom 10 months ago. I have Crohn's disease and someone suggested kratom for the stomach pain and diarrhea. It really helped at first but within a few months I found myself having to take more and more for the same affects. I got up to 60 plus grams a day and decided to quit CT 14 days ago. This is my first withdrawal experience and thus far it's been a challenge to say the least. All of my withdrawal systems are pretty much gone now except insomnia. I work 12 hour shifts on third. 7PM to 7am. So my sleep schedule tends to be screwed up anyways but this as really messed it up. I've tried every supplement listed on here but little help. I can't take over the counter sleep aids because it makes the RLS come back. I'm going to the doctor today to maybe get some prescription sleep meds but don't want to become dependent on those. Any advise would be great and thanks again for the support.,6,0

My blood pressure was rising to very unhealthy levels and it started to fuck w my mind and my train of thought. I was on it over 5 years. Quit once in 2016 for 6 weeks, then picked it back up. I would take it mom-fri then rest on the weekends. Then sometime in 2018 I started taking it everyday and had not gone a day without it in over 2 years. I took an OZ a day. Sometimes more. The shit kept getting cheaper, stronger, and more available. Even the gas stations around here sell the good brands. 200Gm packs of powder for $29.99. I was spending too much money on it. Years ago I had racked up several thousand on a credit card buying capsules. My wife found out and I quit paid it all off. I am secretly kicking because there is no way I can go though that again w her. I have no debt because of it but I still spent more than I should on it. The problem is that it wasn‚Äôt just that I had to take it everyday so that I wouldn‚Äôt get sick. Other than the health problems it was causing I actually enjoyed taking it everyday. The shit felt good!!  I fucked myself up surfing in Cali last summer and was prescribed Lortab. It didn‚Äôt even feel as good as the K. This last weekend I decided that enough was enough. I can‚Äôt taper. I would just end up taking tomorrow‚Äôs dose. I jumped ship cold turkey. I‚Äôm right at the 24hr mark without it. I didn‚Äôt sleep but about 2hr total last night. Kicking my ass off of course. I‚Äôm about to get out of bed and get ready for work. It‚Äôs going to take all I have in me to get through a busy as work day that requires my focus to then come home to cook and clean and take care of kids. Any remedies that anyone can suggest I would appreciate. I don‚Äôt know enough about Gabapentin to order it offline and don‚Äôt trust any vendors. It would have to be OTC or herbal remedies. I wish I had some friends that had some benzos to hook me up with but nobody I know takes any of that shit. I‚Äôm not going to ever take K again. I know that I can stop by store here in an hour or so and feel right as rain again but fuck this shit!!!  No more!  Never again. I wish this shit were illegal. There has to be so many strung out kids in my state. The opioid crisis is in full swing in every state and in most states K is available everywhere. It is a bad plant. Yes it has some therapeutic advantages and I‚Äôm sure it helps people get off true opiates but it is a scourge and addicts like me cannot use it responsibly. We‚Äôre going to exploit the shit out of it for our pleasure every time. I have a buddy that was hooked on H and had been clean for years. All he can offer is his sympathy and someone to talk to but he has his own shit to deal w at home and won‚Äôt answer the phone at 0315 when I‚Äôm kicking my own dick off. I appreciate the support. I don‚Äôt have any other ‚Äúgroups‚Äù to turn to as I am not going to verbally acknowledge this shit and just kick is silence. I refuse to let K beat me. I‚Äôm gonna beat this shit I just hope it doesn‚Äôt take too long and that my heath will improve and damage done will reverse!!!  Thanks.",3,0

My body is also having slight temperature problems, as well as mild aches.  I have had periods of clarity and energy tho, but they have come and go thru the process of getting clean.

I‚Äôm so baffled by what‚Äôs currently happening in my ongoing mission to get off this stuff. I was taking doses of 100-120gpd up until two nights ago, when I suddenly got very bad Parkinson‚Äôs-like tremors with my last dose of the night. It was actually quite scary because I didn‚Äôt know if it was permanent or why it was happening, but 20 minutes after my last dose, I started shaking like a leaf.

When I woke up and took my morning dose the next day, the same thing happened. I thought maybe it was the strain causing it and tried another for my next dose but got the same results.

I decided to stop taking any k and see what happened. 10.5 hours later (I normally was dosing every 2-3 hours), I finally started to get agitated, RLS and sweaty, so took a small dose. It didn‚Äôt banish the w/d symptoms so I took another, nothing yet, so a third dose and this one took me out of w/d and put me into Parkinson‚Äôs mode again. My daily total for the day was 75 grams‚Äî45g less than I‚Äôd been taking.

Apparently there is a very small window of what I can take that gets rids of withdrawals but doesn‚Äôt make me shake. I‚Äôm still figuring out what that amount is, but as long as I don‚Äôt feel too crappy I don‚Äôt take any. It just feels really weird to drop down in dosage so drastically and not be in agony!

 2.5mg hydrocodone (against my better judgment and good advice from other users) to get through the withdrawals on the first day of going CT. I hate pill form of opiates and I think that is the only reason this worked for me. The last two days, I have only used ibuprofen and today is the first day I woke up, before my alarm went off, feeling rested. 

I feel like I got off a little too easy for 5 years of nonstop use, but I'm not going to question it. Strangely, I don't have any urges to make myself a cup of kratom tea- It does not sound appealing at all. I have replaced my tea habit with herbal tea 3 times a day. Also, feeling strange and different, a lot lighter - like my body just feels lighter. Also, I usually wake up puffy in the face every morning and it takes about an hour or two to go down - woke up without any sort of puffiness today for the first time in years. 

I'm excited to see/feel how y body heals over the next few months. This experience has definitely given me an appreciation for my body's natural harmony - something I haven't felt in a while.

My question to you is, did I sort of ""reactivate"" my WD symptoms by caving in those few times? I still have a majority time as sober, and I didn't think the amount I took when I got weak was enough to activate the sweats and extreme anxiety again. But here I am.

I‚Äôve been taking all the supplements religiously since day one and they did nothing to help with sleep. 

I‚Äôve also been eating super clean and drinking a gallon of water a day. Which helps with energy and fuels your body with what it needs to heal. 

You need sleep! And I‚Äôd highly advise doing whatever you have to in order to get it. Went to my psychiatrist and told her I was in WD and desperately needed sleep so she‚Äôd wrote me a Rx. 

I‚Äôve always been against prescription helpers in the past but now my stance has definitely changed.

Proper sleep has been a game changer for sure.

Good luck to everyone especially those still in the trenches just getting started. You will get there and be glad bet you made the leap!",3,0

Hopefully someone here can give some guidance here regarding ldn and Kratom.
Brief history. Long time kratom user over the last 5 years. Successfully had at least 6 months off until recently. I‚Äôve been back on kratom for a month at a dosage of about 25g a day - thing is this time I have been taking ldn (low dose naltrexone) every night I have been on it at about 2mg at bedtime.
During the day the euphoria was not as pronounced, but I was still getting some effect. 

Now I need to quit and want to stop immediately- like tomorrow morning. I have been waking up with some watery eyes and yawns which indicate some withdrawal.

Has anyone done this? Anyone one know what I will be in for?",1,0

The kratom just makes me so sluggish that I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs depression and what‚Äôs kratom anymore. I‚Äôm so fucking sick of the constant obsession of having doses with me, watching the clock when I can dose again.  But I also hate the idea of quitting because I‚Äôm an addict and this is it for me. The end of the line.  Nothing left to take and still keep my life together.  

Awhile back, I started to taper because I didn‚Äôt want to repeat the experience of CT. I am taking less for sure but I am all over the place.  Some days more than others. Dosing every two-three hours because I‚Äôm not taking much at a time and I am not getting The pleasure of the high.  I keep chasing it but don‚Äôt want to take as much as I was. 

I have a five day, kid free, work free period coming up.  I am either quitting on the 5th or 6th.  The kids will be gone and I won‚Äôt be working by the time the WD set in.  I‚Äôm scared but I just need the maddness to end and to hopefully get better. I truly believe this is adding to my depression and lack of motivations. I‚Äôm tired of being tired.

I just thought I post an update. Just a bit of a background. I used kratom for years. I used about 6g a day.  (2x 3g, morning and evening)

I don't really think about kratom a lot anymore. Occasionally I have the thought ""wouldn't it be nice to do some kratom right now"", I even feel briefly tempted to order some, but then I remember how bad I felt being a user and I realise it is not worth it.  I will say quitting didn't solve any of my non-kratom related problems (obviously). Sometimes after quitting it is tempting to think ""from now on everything will be different"", but that requires additional effort. Still, I am happy to no longer have the burden of a kratom addiction on my shoulders. 

I hope you guys/gals stay strong and remember it will get better. Just hang in there. (yeah, pretty cliche, but true)",36,0

This time kicked my ass not gonna lie.   These last two weeks have been hell, but each day has been getting slightly better.

I know that tapering would have been a smarter approach, but I wanted to feel the pain...I wanted to have this experience emotionally scarred into my brain so that it would scare me from ever wanting to go back down this path again...I did not want this to be too easy or else I knew I'd be tempted to go back to kratom.

Humans are creatures of amnesia so I have been journaling like crazy every single day long entries about everything I have been experiencing, the up's, the downs, the emotions, everything...and these will serve as scary reminders someday....because I know a day will come months from now when I may think ""eh what could a little kratom hurt?"" but at that moment I will re-read my journal entries to remind myself of the torture I went through trying to free myself from this stuff.

The first week was the worst....The first 4 days my blood pressure was a stagger 200/115...scared the piss out of me....because I've always had normal BP, but in doing research online I discovered that this is a typical symptom of those going through withdrawals...especially from kratom....and this is especially scary because blood pressure is the silent killer.   Fortunately that only last a couple of days, and by the end of the week was back down to normal levels.   Sleep was very difficult the first two weeks....but finally the last two nights was the first nights I have able to go to sleep without any sleep-aid...win!

Today is a proud day for me because I am feeling a solid 6 out of 10.  In my journaling I've been keep track of how I feel each day.  The first week was a stead 1-2 out of 10.  The second week was a 3 out of 10.  And now that I'm getting into week 3 I'm feeling much better...I know I still have a long way to go because emotions are still all over the place....sometimes I feel really good and then a few hours later I'll feel depressed and lethargic.  But I'm grateful for all of the small little wins.

I've made so many realizations.  Something I have come to realize is how much of a hermit I became while on kratom.  I've barely dated over the past year or two.  In fact, barely even hung out with friends....kratom just made me content living like a hermit.  Now that I'm off of it I realize that was not healthy.  I'm a fairly attractive guy, and have women come on to me all the time, but I always blow them off just to stay home alone and watch Netflix by myself.  The past week have blown off multiple opportunities to go out with very attractive women basically throwing themselves at me, but just didn't want to be around any humans.  So last night I forced myself to hang out with a chic and we had a really good time, jammed out on music, and just felt so good to feel some human interaction...made me feel so good and get sensations that I haven't felt in a long time that I decided tonight I'm going to go out with another girl and I have to admit I feel really excited about it.  I'm not saying this to brag because trust me I'm no player by any means...I've lived like a hermit the past couple years, but I'm ready to go out and start having fun again and enjoying the fruits of life.  It feels good to feel these kinds of emotions again that I haven't felt in a while.  

This group has really helped a lot.  I haven't posted, but I'm here everyday reading posts and getting inspiration from you all.  

I'd say the biggest things that have helped me is sleep, daily exercise, acceptance and forgiveness.  I think a big part of what causes things like Kratom to become so addicting is because our society puts so much pressure on us to succeed and be perfect and keep up with the joneses.  And when you go through these withdrawals your performance in life drops like crazy which can be really depressing...but we gotta be easy on ourselves...forgive ourselves for being human and not being perfect.   Hope you all are staying strong!

I reached 35 gpd and stayed there for about a year. I moved back in with my parents in May after graduating college and have been working since. Yesterday they found out about my kratom use. They knew about it before, in college but I told them I quit. Thankfully, my parents are wonderful and they want to help me quit, they know how much I've struggled to stay clean in the past with other stuff. They recommend me seeing an addiction specialist and a sleep specialist as that's what I'm really concerned about. Also coincidentally, my job just unceremoniously ended which is unfortunate but it also seems it makes it a good time to CT.

I coincidentally ran out of kratom yesterday and I have been taking 15 gpd the last two weeks as part of a taper. I've tried to taper twice before but this time has been the most successful by far. Taking the smaller doses has felt way better once I've adjusted to them. I have more energy and emotion along with some withdrawal symptoms. I swapped from taking two large doses a day to 3 or 4 small doses and it's a change I should've made a long time ago. Now I'm not going to buy anymore and try to go CT. I'm going to buy some basic supplements today and I wanted to ask your guys advice. I've gathered a lot of info from this sub over the past few months about supplements but want to ask:

&#x200B;

does taking melatonin make RLS symptoms worse? I would often take melatonin but haven't taken it for a month since tapering. 

what will help with getting to sleep? will THC or CBD help? This is the issue I am most worried about. I can deal with the unpleasant feelings during the day but not being able to get comfortable and fall asleep at night is torturous. I started consuming THC a month ago as a way to encourage myself to continue with the taper plan and also assist me in falling and staying asleep. It's worked great so far. I'm going to stop taking THC as soon as I feel like the acutes are gone and the paws are manageable.

&#x200B;

I don't think I'd be this far along in quitting if it wasn't for this sub, so I'd sincerely like to thank each and every one of you for contributing to this thing that's really helping a lot of people out there.

BETTER MAN (ROBBIE WILLIAMS)

Send someone to love me,

Keep me safe from harm,
In pouring rain,

Give me endless summer,

Feel I'm getting old,
Before my time,

As my soul heals the shame,
I will grow through this pain,
Lord I'm doing all I can,
To be a better man,

Go easy on my concious,
'Cause it's not my fault,
I know I've been taught,
To take the blame,

Rest assured my angels,
Will catch my tears,
Walk me out of here,
I'm in pain,

As my soul heals through the shame,
I will grow through this pain,
Lord I'm doing all I can,
To be a better man,

Once you've found that lover,
You're homeward bound,
Love is all around,
Love is all around,

I know some have fallen,
On stony ground,
But love is all around,

Send someone to love me,
I need to rest in arms,
Keep me safe from harm,
In pouring rain,

Give me endless summer,
Lord I fear the cold,
Feel I'm getting old,
Before my time,

As my soul heals the shame,
I will grow through this pain,

He has to work a lot, for long periods at a time.   
Anyway, he was taking several doses (every 2-3 hrs) adding up to around 45 grams per day, and loving the results. For whatever reason, without thinking about it, he went longer than normal between doses and he began having, what I perceived as a panic attack; had the shakes, nervous, sense of impending doom and looked really scared. At first we didn‚Äôt make the connection, and couldn‚Äôt understand how a person with no history of anxiety, suddenly have panic attacks so severe we almost went to the emergency room. After searching several times on Google looking for an answer to possible medical conditions that could cause this as a side effect I came across an article about Kratom withdrawal.  After seeing the article I discussed it with him and the next time he had an attack he went and took a shot of crate him and sure enough it stopped. the  articles I‚Äôve read  say that it‚Äôs similar to opioid withdrawal except milder. his symptoms do not seem mild to me except that he does not have any of the diarrhea/throwing up or runny nose/eyes symptoms.  He is trying to taper down slowly to reduce the intensity of the withdrawal symptoms,  but I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre doing it in the best way possible.

I'm feeling pretty good though. Sleep isn't that great still, and I'm having some horrible GI issues, but I'm just happy to be off kratom.

My body temperature regulation is getting better. I can go outside with a jacket on now and not feel like it's -20¬∞. Aches and pains are like 5% of what they were on day 1-3.

The only weird thing though... Is that I keep getting feelings of nostalgia CONSTANTLY. Like memories of my life before kratom popping up over and over again, along with powerful emotions associated with them.

I think this is my body saying it was definitely time to quit and life can be good again off kratom. Looking forward to the future.",3,0

But thats why I'm doing this. 

I'm on week 3 of my taper, with an average starting point of about 50 grams per day, I'm now down to about 38-45 depending on the day.

 I'm going very slow. May not sound like a lot, but the important part is that I'm developing a rigid dosing schedule that I'm sticking to. Before, when I wasn't at work I would be dosing every 1-2 hours just chasing that feeling (spoiler: i never got it). Now, I never dose more than every 3 hours, sometimes every 4 or 5 hours. Which is nice because it gives me a reliable and fair way to lower my dosage over time. 

Over time I plan to drop each dose by a gram at a time, until I'm at a level where I'm comfortable with. Honestly, whether I want to jump off completely is yet to be seen. I simply want to reach a point that i can take sensible dosages and not have it control my moods. Hoping to get down to 20g per day then i will reassess.

I knew that it was a bad deal overall, but I had a few unexpected Bill's pop up and wiped out my cash flow until got paid again in a week and a half. So, when I say phenibut, I mean those limitless pills you can get at smoke shops. Atomixx limitless. I had been taking them for about a month ever day, aside from a short, couple day break halfway through the month. Even just at the two week break point, I had some issues when I stopped taking them. I have no clue how much phenibut is in each pill. It just says "" proprietary blend "" with no actual specific number  on every ingredient individually.  So each package had 4 pills and I'd take one of those packages usually 3 times a day. Then I'd start buying a big bottle of them, which contained 20 pills, 5 at a time, 3 times a day. I even took a whole bottle in a day on a few occasions. So anyways..I managed to come up with a little bit of cash, and knew I was guna have to cold Turkey one of them and chose to do the phenibut, and the kratom I had, would hopefully ease the phenibut withdrawal. I started to panic when I read all of your replies, saying a few of you had ended up in the ER quitting phenibut. So, I figured if I'm guna end up calling 911, that's just what it was. The first 24 hours wasnt horrible. But the next day, shit started to get kinda sketchy.  My heart was beating out of my chest. No matter how much kratom I took, I still felt like shit. I was having a real hard time breathing.  Shaking. Panicking! Racing heart. Racing thoughts. I didnt have any way to get a prescription or know anyone that had any benzos or anything, but I did have 5 ativan pills, and also scored a few xanax from my stepdad. I think those are what kept me from calling an ambulance to my house. Scary shit. So, once I got through the week, at about the 5 or 6 day mark, I decided to move on to the kratom detox. That was last Sunday night. I gobbled up that last of my kratom that night and monday was my day 1. Well, I was taking between 40 and 60 gpd of the kratom . Not sure how kratom detox goes for you guys, but the time goes SO. FUCKING. SLOOOWWWW....anyway, I tried to scrounge up some more benzos with no luck. The only thing that really helps me is drinking. It's such a bad idea and really slows the recovery process down. Waking up hungover AND in the middle of a detox, is fuxking rough dude. And dumb but its the only thing that kind of helps me pass the time. If I can keep it to  minimum, and avoid a ridiculously horrible hangover, it's not bad. Ofcourse I cant manage to do that though, and ens up going hard, waking up hungover and drinking more. Fuxking hair of the dog. I'd advise you guys to NOT use my technique. Hahaha. So , I did that this whole week but two days ago, a bunch of old friends are blowing up my phone, asking what happened.. well, turns out, my ex girlfriend, what had gotten pretty hard into heroin after we broke up, ended up overdosing Nd passed away. This fucking kills me and I'm kind of losing my shit, so I go hard on the beer the night I heard about her dying, and then yesterday again. I probably killed between 16 and 19 beers throughout the entire day. I'd say I'm averaging out at 3 or 4 hours of sleep a night. Tossing and turning a majority of the night . So, I woke up today after about 3 hours of sleep. Hungover as all hell, still not through my kratom withdrawal, and fucking CAVED.. went to the herb shop and picked up some kratom. ..... ....... I feel like a fucking idiot. Just threw a pretty rough 6 days. I was in my room/ bed just about all 6 of the days. Didnt leave my house once. Pretty fuckin bad week. So today. Day 6 of cold turkey...threw it all away. So I'm not really sure.. if I pick back up tomorrow, do you guys think I'll be back at square one and have to start over? That's kind of my guess. Which sucks. But if I don't shake it off, and get back on the turkey train, it's only guna get worse, the more days I keep using kratom . It's so fucking hard. This back and forth bullshit. You want something so bad, but you wrestle back and forth to yourself. And boom. You're tossing back a cup full of that green garbage. I know it's a choice, and some could argue that I'm just making excuses to relapse. But I know there are those of you who know the struggle.

Like everyone else here, at first it was great. I own a small company and it helped me relax after work, while still being able to function completely normally. I read up a bit on it and realized that I shouldn't make it a daily habit, but in my head I rationalized doing it because it wasn't something I viewed as extremely harmful, like say cocaine. For awhile it was great. I'm very into lifting and hobbyist bodybuilding. Kratom blunted my appetite which helped me stick to my diet perfectly and get in the best shape of my life. After a few months I noticed my sex drive was non-existent... Which went perfectly with my intent of avoiding putting too much emphasis on being single. I travel somewhat frequently and my first trip while using krater was when I noticed the withdrawals. I was only using 2-3g/day but even still, going those four days without felt terrible. I got home, downed some kratom, and was instantly relieved. I knew at that point I needed to stop but I had never dealt with a real addiction like this. I've used quite a few addictive substances before, but always proceeded with caution and practiced harm reduction strategies to avoid regular use. 

Over the next 19 or so months I quit and relapsed constantly. Occasionally I'd go 2-3 weeks, at which point I'd justify that I could use it sparingly, which was an obvious lie. My use never got too high as I was on this board and realized if I increased dosage, it'd get exponentially worse. Max of 10g or so per day. Keeping a low dose, along with a perfectly regimented exercise routine, and great diet allowed me to mitigate a lot of the nasty side effects that people deal with. Except for one, my sex life was absolute garbage. I've had plenty of dates and flings with attractive women but for some reason I just didn't enjoy the sex. 

Fast forward to the end of 2019 I finally realized I had to take action and quit. I stopped the day before New Years and have committed myself 100% to self improvement. Over the course of the past month my life has changed so rapidly. My libido has completely returned as expected, but also my burning passion for life has as well. I had no clue how much of a zombie I had become on the inside, because for the entire period of kratom use I masked that with what seemed to be a great social life and relationships. I'm back to being the driven entrepreneur that can work 60 hours a week without hesitation. I've planned out the next huge step for my main company, and started another to get my feet wet in E-Commerce. My emotions are coming back in full swing and I've realized how beautiful life is. My friendships and relationships are improving by the day.  I'm more compassionate and present. I've always been a music addict, and while kratom never killed that love, it was greatly diminished since I felt none of the emotional intensity that comes from great music. I'm surprised at how much of a life changing revelation that quitting this garbage substance has been. I've made some other lifestyle adjustments over this period, so I can't say with exact certainty what I owe to stopping kratom use, but I do know that the extremely minimal buzz that I got the first time I took that garbage substance isn't even remotely worth the extent that it diminished my overall quality of life. 

Sending the good vibes out to everyone struggling with this shit. Keep at it, I'd bet my home that you're life will improve once you've kicked the habit! Everything in your life is under your control, you just have to decide to love yourself enough to sacrifice short term comfort for long term results.",11,1

About 8 grams a day with the very occasional day off. I started taking it to chill out on drinking but didn‚Äôt know how to keep my anxiety in check and found out about Kratom at my work (I used to manage a smoke shop/adult store) it was super great at first with helping my anxiety but I slowly just got more and more isolated. I also notice my energy is super low and I feel run down/like I‚Äôm getting sick constantly. Even when I was boozing my immune system was amazing, I rarely ever got sick. At first I felt great cus I wasn‚Äôt drinking and no longer had a perpetual hangover. But I feel like I experience hangovers from Kratom, I get really dehydrated and anxious in the am. I will say one thing and that it got me to stop drinking completely, which I‚Äôm happy about. Not sure if I would‚Äôve had the will power to stop on my own... Anyway, I decided I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on anything but it‚Äôs tough when you have constant anxiety and no health insurance. But I want to be healthy and deal with my anxiety in a more efficient way. I felt like Kratom was no longer serving me. I‚Äôm not here to judge anyone, only here to share my experience. I cut my doses in half the past few days and already felt the withdrawals. I decided to just stop completely now, no use dragging this out, I just want to get it over with. I just want to be social and have energy again but I always relied on stuff to do that. I wish I could reset my brain. I‚Äôm attempting to. Good luck to y‚Äôall out there. If anyone has any tips on how they endured the withdrawals, I‚Äôd love to hear them. We got this!",11,1
523,2020-02-01 17:04:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/exdfk3/day_0/,Day 0.,"I did a poor job tapering. I took around 18g today. My use the past few weeks has ranged from 12-20g. Tapered slow from 35gpd in the summer. Today at work I felt so shitty. Maybe depression from realizing major suffering is coming and being unhappy with how I am at work. So dull and unsocial, doing my thing. I felt like my fluid balance was extra messed up too, dehydrated and pissing a lot. 

My 4.5 year ‚Äúparty‚Äù is over... using 5-8x per day. I took 3g after work, I don‚Äôt know why I bothered . 

I‚Äôll sleep tonight and then starts what I‚Äôve feared early in the morning. At least I don‚Äôt have to work. 

I‚Äôve also been a 4.5 year phenibut user. .5g 2x per day. I have been feeling the crash from it about 6-8 hours after taking. I have to be sure to take the bare minimum, maybe even less during this quit. 

I hope I make it guys. I fully intend to, but everyone has a breaking point. I‚Äôve quit years of suboxone before and didn‚Äôt sleep 6 days, but I was in a rehab and didn‚Äôt have a choice. Thought about flipping out and making a scene one night at 4am in hopes they‚Äôd give me something to calm cause it was hell inside me. I didn‚Äôt though. 

I wasn‚Äôt even feeling the suboxone and only took it once a day. I have a feeling this may be worse. 

To everyone with some clean time: much respect. I can‚Äôt wait for this shit to get out of my system and to get this over with. My brain has been so compromised, such a burden on it. I would go into debt 20,000$ if I could wake up on day 30. Maybe 10,000$ for day 7.",2,0

Pretty sure I‚Äôm creeping back to my baseline but there‚Äôs definitely still bad days.

Anyways I‚Äôve been on here a bit and something that I‚Äôve been doing that seems to be helping that I haven‚Äôt seen anybody talk about. Is hypnosis.

It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs easy, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be possible during acutes because of insomnia. But it‚Äôs definitely changed my way of thinking and I‚Äôm feeling more happy, more confident, less angry, less sad, etc. 

Basically when I lay down for bed I put on this audio book and it puts me right to sleep and it‚Äôs supposed to re-wire your subconscious for the better. And just a heads up, it‚Äôs not an instant fix. You have to do it consistently to notice the changes. I‚Äôm on day 5 of listening and I‚Äôve definitely noticed something different about my thought process, emotions, and happiness during the day.

Anyways just thought I‚Äôd share. It‚Äôs a different approach to re-wiring the brain following the terrible imbalance kratom puts your brain in.

And if you‚Äôre looking for something to help in addition to the supplements, exercise, eating healthy give it a try.  I know that stuff helps but I kinda hit a wall where I felt like I was stuck in bad days for about a week and this has definitely been beneficial for me.

Hope this helps! Good luck!",1,0

Im on day 3 of of a quick taper. I went from 6-7 tablespoons a day to about 3 teaspoons a day. I decided to quit this stuff when I noticed a lot of irrational fear building up in me and thinking people at work were trying to hurt me. I have suffered Depression and anxiety for many years but never on quite a level where I though I was going to constantly die. I've been experiencing all the typical withdrawal symptoms like extreme sadness and crying, body chills, dread and anxiety etc. The lack of sleep is the worst of course. I started taking magnesium, New Mood 5htp, and cbd oil. I have a job interview on monday so I dont want to completely jump off yet because I don't want to be a total wreck for it. Im planning some cardio during the day only taking a teaspoon at night before bed though I still cant sleep with that. Im also meditating which I think helps with the anxiety. Anyway, does it sound like Im on the right track?
I appreciate any support.

Whoops.

An hour later, my RHR was at 140 and rising, and I was having palpitations. Went to the ER, they ran tests, gave me an IV of Toradol and Ativan, and then left me alone for two hours before discharging me. Nothing was gained, nothing was learned. Except that toradol sucks. 

By the time I left the ER, my RHR had dropped to 109. Came home, slept for a few hours, woke up, still feel trashed.

Living awesome life. Low gpd usage dosing once in morning and once in the evening.
One year usage, used for pain due to interstitial cystitis and gnarly anxiety.
Well I took my dose age last Sunday and I had random heart palpitations and then onset INSANE panic attack thought I was dieing. 
Thought it was the smoke shop crap I bought because I ran out of my organic brand. Next day I took what I had left of my organic brand and soon enough after morning dose I started having heart palpitations and then had my panic attacks. Fast forward it‚Äôs been five days of arrhythmias I got referred to cardiologist. I‚Äôm just looking for some love and support.
Wtf did I get my self into.
I planned to quit Jan 1st through tapering because I was tired of being addicted. Started messing with my eyesight, and cognition. The panic attacks are day in and day out and I have been taking Xanax just to get by. Scared to fall asleep at night. I know I‚Äôm being a wuss but I was living an amazing life with this ‚Äònatural added supplement‚Äô to help with the pain I feel in my bladder everyday. 
Any suggestions on supplements for the panic attacks, how long until I can level out after w/d,
And are these arrhythmias going to screw me up or what?
This is my first post, please be kind I am trying to better my life. 
I‚Äôve been eating healthy as best I can while withdrawing.
I had pizza the first day and I had ice cream in between (throw me a bone here) but I have been supplementing with healthy omegas, vit d, ashwaghanda, gaba, lemon balm, .5 Xanax, water, chia seeds ,flax seed oil, collagen mix, Himalayan pink salt...(electrolyte mix)
Hope I‚Äôm on the right course of recovery.
Started wim hof breathing course, those have helped. Anything else that could bless me at this time, especially with the anxiety and panic which is damn near causing me friggin hallucinating.!
These are pretty much my only symptoms so far besides feeling sluggish.

I have to say the comfort I feel quitting finally is like no other and I hope to keep the strength to stay away. I swore by it and suggested it to everyone, but I started having issues I just couldn‚Äôt  hang with and consciously knew I needed to stop. The random arrhythmias were a sign it was time to stop.",2,0
