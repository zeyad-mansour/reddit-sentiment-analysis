Anyway, I am 24 and I have been taking kratom for about 4 years exactly now. I started kratom to help with anxiety and depression. I had an opiate pill addiction at a young age and since then I haven’t taken another pill that can be abused. Started off as an oz from the local smoke shop would last a week or more and I could take t breaks whenever I wanted. Zero wd, then as time went on I used kratom as a very strong crutch to my mental state and since I am an addict already I just did what addicts do and I jumped in full force. 

Next thing I know I’m taking an oz a day, then it’s more and more. Well as of me typing this I got myself to taking tonight 15-18 grams per dose, 5 times a day. It’s because I still get the “good feels” at that dose. I know it’s ridiculous, but I chase that feel. Well I have been taking that high of doses for about month and it’s effecting my sex performance (I am a male). I have issues getting in the mood and thus, have issues in being able to get aroused. 

I also can’t do this anymore, I can’t be dependent on a plant, I can’t keep waiting the moments as to when can I sneak to the bathroom and lock that door to secretly take a dose, I can’t let it control my thoughts.

I used kratom daily for 2 years, approximately 12 g a day. I tapered down somewhat and then quit cold turkey about 3 months ago. I do believe I am mostly over withdrawals with some exceptions. I have definitely found that I am thinking about creating less and less as the days and weeks go by and I'm no longer dealing with the intense depressive moves that I was once in. However, they are not totally gone by any means. Here is a list of things I've noticed since quitting.

The good:

I no longer have a deep sense of guilt that I would wake up with everyday as a kratom addict.
I no longer have the feeling of addiction chains in my life and I feel free from the addiction.
 I'm actually way more productive at work because I'm not constantly thinking about getting off of work so I can go home and get high. 
 I feel way more better physically, maybe not always mentally, but most certainly physically.
 I'm finding that I am getting into some very positive daily routines consistently such as working out on the regular. This is the best shape I've been in and probably 8 years physically. 
 I have a sense of peace in my soul that I did not have while on kratom.

The bad: ( take this with the grain of salt because anything is better than taking kratom)

I still have some episodes of depression that would easily be remedied by some kratom. I do find it hard to enjoy the activities that I once did and it is a challenge at times to get motivated and interested in such activities such as playing music, listening to music, etc. It is a challenge to meet the level of energy and enthusiasm that my kids have grown to expect from me after work and I'm tired. While on kratom I had lots of energy and it's not that way these days. That being said, I believe that my kids are also responding to the changes I've made in a positive way and their own lives.

Bottom line, I have gained a way more healthy and responsible functional life as an adult and parent. And maybe I have lost some degrees of comfort feelings of happiness and senses of well-being. But I can tell you straight up that quitting kratom is most certainly been way more positive than negative. Remember that even after 90 days the brain is still rewiring itself and it could take a couple years to really get back to your old self. But I think that I am over the majority of the withdrawals and post a cutic withdrawal syndrome. Next time you start feeling depressed and hopeless start thinking on the positive. What is it that you have in your life that you are thankful for? I find that if I start thinking positively my mood starts to change for the better. Just don't replace your drug habit with another drug habit. You need to start exercising. I exercise every weekend. I do cardio and yoga and I eat healthy food everyday.

Hope this helps. Keep it up, it does get easier. You have power and strength. Just be on the horizon that you never knew you had. Just keep going! ✌️",18,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9785386919975281}"

 Idk, I just can't believe it effects SO many parts of the body. I couldn't even list all the weird side effects I've gotten. And I can't believe I didn't realize it was the kratom sooner. It took months of trying to figure out what was wrong with me before I made the connection. Really till my hair started falling out lol.

I started taking kratom to get off of xanax and ambien. I knew about the dangers of kratom and addiction when I started, so I told myself I wouldn’t go over 6 grams a day. I used kratom as a tool (along with caffeine) to get through the day and to keep me from feeling too depressed. Which it worked, my life did get better and I made a lot of self improvements, as opposed to being on benzodiazepines. I don’t give all credit to the kratom, but it sure helped me get through tough times. Still, I hit a point where I just needed to get sober from it. My life started to feel dull, was losing a lot of hair, & had little motivation for hobbies. 

Days 1-4 I got body aches, headaches, and fatigue. Day 5 I had a bad day, not because of wd but was dealing with some stuff and got drunk that night. The hangover mixed with K wd was absolutely horrible. I felt so depressed, nauseous, and got cramps throughout the day. Worst days were 6&7, because of the hangover. I used to drink that much alcohol while I was taking kratom and my hangovers were never that bad. Do not recommend getting drunk, at least 1st week of withdrawals. Day 8 is today and I feel pretty good.

All in all, the wd is not as bad as I thought it would be. I took vitamin C, CBD gummies, Metamucil everyday. Drank a lot of water, and valerian root to sleep. I was able to sleep okay this past week, never got runs, and managed my depression and anxiety for the most part. I know I wasn’t taking a lot but it still feels like a big accomplishment.

It was relatively easy to quit that when I ran out. Now that I found an in-person place I've realized the real addictive potential of this plant. I had issues with alcohol in the past which was scarily addicting stuff, and I'd put kratom like one point below that now.

So I'm getting pretty ready to quit at this point due to kratom basically sucking the soul out of your life and turning you into a shell of your former self. The apathy and laziness and lack of sex drive is ridiculous. I've been using like 10GPD for the first month, and then up to averaging 20GPD in the second month. So 2 months now in total.

I've also rationalized the ""Oh today I'll just get 10g and that would be like a rapid taper and I'll be off tomorrow."" multiple times already. Hasn't worked. Would you guys recommend just cold turkeying this and it should be smooth?

After I stopped the tinctures I was up to 50 - 60gpd. I've been on a slow taper and now I'm down to about 8gpd. I'm really proud of myself, but I've been stuck here for months and I can't bring myself to go down anymore. I have 4 little ones and my husband works 3rd shift and is either sleeping or working so it's usually just me and my kids. I can't see myself just jumping off CT and being okay. 

I don't know if I'm just sick or if it's the kratom doing things to me, but my hair has been falling out, I feel like my muscles are squeezing me to death, I'm dizzy and shaky all the time, I get muscle spasms all over, and I can't eat. I've lost 45lbs in the last year and I'm down to 104 lbs. I've been to so many doctors and had so many tests and I'm completely healthy. I have absolutely no emotions and feel like I won't ever be able to feel things again or enjoy life. My marriage is failing because I'm just a shell of a person.

Been taking kratom once a day (never twice), ever day, for ten years. There were periods where I got up to maybe 16GPD, but overall for the last 5years I only took 3-4GPD, occasionally 5 every few months if I had to attend some stressful social function, and then would drop back down to 3-4GPD within a few days.

Week before last I dropped down slowly in the 2 gram ranges, and I took 1.75 grams on Monday and Tuesday of this week, nothing Wednesday, and today is Saturday. I haven't had any chills, sweats, nausea, or more acute symptoms since Friday morning. In general I just keep feeling very hyper, but unable to concentrate or focus on anything. And my sleep is bad. Overall quitting is bearable, all of this is quite bearable, and there's no desire to take more kratom, albeit 'kratom' occupies A LOT of my thoughts.

Unfortunately most of the reports on this reddit that I can find are people who were taking far larger doses than me and/or have a long history of opiate abuse, and/or took it more than once a day. I had two *huge* breakthroughs in therapy this month and after the second one everything in my body just told me: quit kratom, you got this, you can be sober. So I believe the underlining issues that were driving me to take kratom have been at least semi resolved.

Does anyone have any lessons, or expectations, for someone in my position? Has anyone quit from around 3-4GPD, after consistent use, and if so, how did that go?

I'm still smoking pot, but my pot use cut down 1/4 after the first therapy breakthrough (1/5/22), and I haven't needed to increase it while kratom withdrawing, although the thought has crossed my mind. (Once I feel all kratom WD issues are *fully* out of my system, I'll work on quitting pot). I quite caffeine the day after thanksgiving, and felt depressed for at least 2-3 weeks.

Sometimes I justify cheating by telling myself it doesn’t matter cuz I’ll just do CT instead?! I know it doesn’t make sense but I’m sure you know all about the self deception. I keep swinging back and forth between fantasizing about a triumphant CT or a slow and steady taper. 

I have been tinkering with memantine which has been helping me stretch out my doses. I have xanax I’ve been saving for when I jump, I’m wondering if memantine during the day and xanax at night could get me through a CT. 

My biggest fear is PAWS. I have ADD and dysthymia and I become absolutely useless without kratom in my system. I’m concerned that I won’t be able to work and keep my life on track in that state.

Long story short, I was born with some congenital heart issues that needed to be repaired surgically in my early 40s. Serious surgery. I also have (previously) substance abuse issues.  Booze and pills and such. 

Despite this, i’ve been off to the races with kratom. About a week ago I went cold turkey off a really high daily dose, I don’t really measure it or anything but it’s probably a minimum of a couple ounces a day. I really feel like shit and I had some symptoms that are common for people here like shortness of breath and palpitations that if you don’t have cardiac history you can kind of ignore but for someone like me you got a fucking deal with it. 

I’ve had a couple of long quits off a kartom him in the past couple years. So I knew what I was in for but I’m really suffering this time. I had a couple of episodes of cardiac symptoms and so I made appointments by cardiologist today and went in. It’s a big deal for me to go to to his office. I’ve been going and seeing him for 15 years, almost 20. Long story short is my blood pressure spike in the office. Way way high. Enough that the nurse sort of scurried off. They did an EKG and an echocardiogram.

I posted something very brief on the daily check-in thread. And somebody on here wrote “just be honest “, with a heart emoji. I took that as a sign to just not allow my addict obfuscation to get in the way and just tell my doctor the truth. I really appreciate the person who wrote that.

The result is much better than I thought it was going to be. He heard me when I said I was in the midst of Kratom withdrawal and that was probably why my blood pressure was spiking. But he didn’t judge me. It turns out that my EKG is fine and the echocardiogram is actually really good which means my heart is structurally OK and the electrical impulses in my heart are OK but my blood pressure is out of control. I got to get on a regime to get my blood pressure down. That’s what’s causing my symptoms.I’m 100% certain this is because of kratom withdraw. I’ve taken my blood pressure pretty regularly for almost 20 years and I’ve never ever ever gotten the readings even close to what I get when I’m withdrawing from kratom. I’m sorry of me saying that scares people but sometimes fear is a motivator. For most people withdrawal probably is in dangerous but if you have underlying health problems you got a fucking stop doing kratom.

Two things: 

1- honesty is challenging and hard to do but it’s the right path.

2- Kratom is really physically bad for you. Look take this is somebody who has decades and decades of history with literally every drug that you can consume, The only exception being intervenous drug use. I was in a medical emergency today lying in a doctors office because of my kratom  abuse. Directly because of my kratom use.  If you’re young and super healthy you probably won’t happen to you but this is a dangerous drug.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9631128311157227}"

Jokes aside.  This blows.  

I was going down the righteous path of tapering util October.  I had a dumb reason for relapsing.  I just moved into a new place and realized how much money I was blowing on Kratom shots.  I wasn't taking as many as I was when I last quit so I decided to switch strictly to leaf and thought I could start at 10g/day.  I might have a been a bit too optimistic.  I've been waking up earlier and earlier the last 3 days .  I'm still getting 7 hours of sleep which is way better than my last quit where I was waking up at 4:00 then having to dose to go back to sleep.  Today I took 2g then took another 1g a little after 9:00.  Having to work sucks during WD, and I'm in sales so motivation is kind of important.  Oh well, time to pay the fucking piper.  Piper is a dick in case you didn't know.

I cut my daily dose down to 15gpd and started my taper there, that fist week was rough but once I adjusted I went on, over the course of the next weeks I got down to 6gpd pretty easily with only a few rough patches.

The innitial withdrawal symptoms have all but dissipated, but I'm struggling with major depression every single day. I only have a few brief moments of relief throughout the day. It seems like there's nothing I can do to take my mind away from these hopeless feelings. On top of my kratom sobriety, I've gone through some significant lifestyle changes recently. My girlfriend of 7 years, who I loved dearly, left me for someone else 6 months ago. Our relationship was pretty tumultuous at times, so perhaps it's for the best, but the loneliness is difficult to bear. We had some incredibly close and intimate times together, but we also had some extremely unhealthy arguments. The job that I used to love is becoming overwhelming. I can barely focus at work now, and I'm crippled with exhaustion despite getting 6-8 hours of sleep every night and eating a reasonably healthy diet. I'm caught up on my bills, but I constantly worry about getting behind on money, losing my apartment, and just giving up. I'm not suicidal, but I feel like giving up. After the break up, I started taking as much Kratom as I wanted to numb the heartache (20-40gpd) It seemed to ""help"" for several months. During that time, I was functioning at work, and I felt like I was getting my life back together. About a month ago, I realized I was experienceing some withdrawal symptoms and the constipation was terrible. That's when I decided to quit. I took two weeks off work (my boss has been very understanding and supportive) I got through the acutes, but now I'm struggling with what I assume is PAWS. I know I have some mental issues I was masking with kratom, alchohol, and weed, for years now. I started to see a therapist once every two weeks, but I haven't been honest about my kratom usage in fear that they might label me a drug seeker, and perhaps they hesitate to give me meds. I know I have untreated ADD, so that's been the focus of my therapy so far. Maybe getting back on ADD meds will help me overcome simple tasks again and take away this constant fatigue. That's where I'm at. I barely get through each day of work, and I'm just looking forward to the moment when I can go home and sleep. I almost caved yesterday and bought some Kratom. I know just one scoop of the green sludge can take away all this anhedonia and hopelessness,  but I know that's not the right solution. I just have to take one day at a time, do as much as I can, and someday soon I'll get some sort of relief. For now, it just sucks! I've complained about my relationship issues and depression to my friends and family for way too long, I don't want to be a debby downer, but sometimes I just need to vent to someone so they understand what I'm going through. That's my sob story. I hope you're all doing well, and I just want to thank this page for all the priceless and supportive insights that have helped me out tremendously.

At my worst, about 70 gpd, but now currently taking 3-4 of these terrible 'Feel Free' shots from 7-11 that have kava and kratom, only probably 2 grams per shot. Been trying to use them to taper but having a hard time dipping below 3. That's not much kratom but the psychological aspect really feeds the relatively minor w/d symptoms because some part of me doesn't feel ready. 

I'm frustrated with myself because how can I not be ready? I'm losing massive amounts of hair, to the point that my forehead hairline looks patchy asf, and I have hashimotos thyroid disease which I know and have known for a long time is reason enough to not take kratom bc of how it screws with the thyroid, and I'm constantly worried I've fucked up my liver permanently. I'm normally a very thrifty person and yet I've been sinking probably $600+ a month on this stuff for years. I also just know that I became dependent on it because I'm a really sensitive person that tends towards the lower end of human emotion and kratom really numbed that and made profound sadness just feel like regular sadness, and numbed my chronic depression, and it gave me the energy to actually go on hikes with friends and go do things. I started drinking at 14 for the same reasons + social anxiety and kratom was a step up from that, it felt like the healthier choice at the time but i know it really isnt any more. Every time I stop I go back to crying and pacing or couch-potatoing at home and feel like such a worthless POS until I cave and get one and affirm this belief that it helps me by suddenly having the energy to go out on a hike. 

But I really need to just suck it up and do it. I wrapped string around my finger to try to remember throughout today of all the reasons I shouldn't. I'm not the person I want to be and I'm too old to keep doing this. I just hope I haven't permanently screwed up my hair and my liver.",26,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979071617126465}"

You’ve either already quit Kratom (great job!) and are trying to stay quit. Or you are looking for the motivation/tools/support to quit. That being said…you cannot have Kratom just once if you’ve had an issue with it before or currently have an issue with it now. 

I was over 6 months free of no Kratom after it had taken away my personality, money, ambitions and livelihood for 3 years. The thought of it didn’t cross my mind much and if it did it was out of fear. At about 4 months CT my daughter died. She was under 4. 

My whole world turned upside down. There is truly truly nothing a human being can go through that is more painful, unimaginable or unfair. I sunk into a deep depression once the casseroles stopped coming and we weren’t busy picking out a tiny casket or buying our burial lots as early 30 somethings so we could be next to our baby. Fucking sickening. My amazing supportive husband took a lot of time off of work because he knew I wasn’t right. But we have two other kids running around and their ain’t no rest for the wicked. So he went back and I sunk deeper and deeper into depression, self loathing, what could I haves, why me, why her and even at some points wanting to die just so I could be with her. 

One day I got the bright idea that maybe just maybe I could take Kratom once to feel a little bit better. To feel something. Then it was maybe I could take it twice. Three times. Every other day. Every day, but only dosing once. Twice. Three times. Pretty soon I was up to my tolerance as when I had previously quit. WITHIN 3 MONTHS. 

I hated myself. I hated lying and the deceit. I hated what I was doing to numb out my daughter’s passing. What a disservice to her. 

My husband straight up asked me one day, ‘Are you taking Kratom again?’ I couldn’t lie and I didn’t. I just crumbled and said I was sorry over and over. He held me and told me he understood why and that we were going to get me off of it. And WE DID. I am 5 days CT and feel pretty close to normal. I think due to the short time taking it. 

Moral of the story is…if you’re thinking of trying Kratom after you’ve quit or thinking you’ll be able to maintain a low dose or just one more time…no you’re lying to yourself. Don’t fucking do it. Don’t.

It was rough but I got thru it with Gabapentin and supplements. Since then I’ve taken it 3-4 times but only 3-5 days in a row max. So the last 11 days I’ve used it daily (8-10gpd less than my old usage) and I decided to stop today. Oh hell- let me tell you, I think I feel worse than the first time I ct’d. I only used it for 11 days!! WTH when I first found kratom it took about a year before I felt wd’s if I didn’t dose. How could 11 days get me this shitty!? Like I said, I’ve used it for a few days in a row and stopped like nothin. I’m a tard. I’m kinda scared rn I know I won’t be sleeping tonight and I have anxiety and my entire body is like buzzing with tense pain. Y’all know the feeling. See, I still love using it now and then but shit, I don’t wanna go thru this ever again. I’m on the Sinclair Method for alcohol use and I can’t take nal until this crap is out of me at least 7 days. Also, when I took kratom in the past a few days in a row, I was able to take naltrexone 2 days later by titrating the dose beginning with 1-2g then 3g more til I reached 25g or til I felt slight pwd’s. I’m considering LDN before consuming it in the future (I know, I shouldn’t touch it again and I won’t for a while I promise). I really hate the feeling of HAVING to take kratom. It sucks so bad. It’s fun for a few days, I get shit done and feel positive and uplifted. That lasted about 8 days then I started waking up with that nasty achy feeling in my back. I will never ever again take it in the morning I swear. Doing that is what got me really addicted the first time around. Also, I’ve taken 7g of stem and vein and 1200mg gab today and I feel sedated but still awful. Tomorrow will likely be worse and I don’t plan in using the s&v.

Got my first full night of sleep last night.

Amaze-balls and much needed.

Quitting during a rainy cold wet winter in some bullshit. The only good I can find is at least everyone else is also bundled up in layers and freezing(except for the mofos who wear shorts still when it’s below 40• F... you guys are a special kind of crazy).

Shits a trip once you get out of acutes and you’re literally feeling your body system trying to reboot. At least I’m finally fully present for my family and not trying to constantly take breaks from them to regroup as well as being able to slowly and carefully handle my daily shit.

Currently holding onto all the little wins to get me through my day(showering, walking, making it through my shift, spending time in my garden mindfully, etc). It really helped me before my quit and during the acutes researching what to expect. Now I’ve shifted to not expecting shit EXCEPT to keep my commitment to not using today, and it serves me well.

Honestly, I’m mourning my relationship w Kratom. I didn’t want to quit, but that shit becomes unsustainable pretty quick. Feel like I broke up w my first sweetheart. Hoping that eventually runs its course, again not expecting shit.

Grateful to be here in this moment being able to make this post. Even more so not to spend every day a slave to dosing.

Today is day 47 and the last two days I feel the same as I did in week 2. I have noticed a pattern though. I will have a string of good days where I feel the withdrawal is behind me and then get blasted with severe anxiety and depression. I never had this before Kratom use. It’s worth noting I quit smoking cigarettes for good 2 weeks ago after tapering on those. Quit marijuana the same time as Kratom. I have quit both of those in the past so I know my problems are still Kratom withdrawal. I do believe Kratom can produce PAWS. That has to be the only explanation for what I am experiencing. I had a massive panic attack last night which has been the usual in this experience, but I feel so good once they pass. Anyway the point is I just need to hear it from somebody who went through this and it eventually got better. After about 9 months of use I know it will take a couple more months for the brain chemicals to balance back out. I am hoping by Spring to feel better. The last day and a half have been tough and usually I find peace in the night time and that carries on the next few days then a couple anxiety fueled days will mix themselves in there.

I have a 5 month pregnant wife and a business. Got clean off heroin in 2013 but had to go to rehab for a year honestly to reset. With the baby on the way and me feeling like shit all day everyday Im starting to get ready to make a move. No one knows about my addiction. I’m super scared to tell everyone. I put my family thru the ringer in 2009-2013. And my wife I can tell knows something is up but I haven’t told her yet. I’m really scared of loosing everything I built up since 2013. I was in a homeless shelter for a year and now on the outside my life looks perfect. Trophy wife, business, truck, house, boat, motorcycle. I’m really scared but know in my gut I need to make the move. I’m not sure what to do, go to detox for a week or 2 and then try to make it on the outside or just fake Covid and detox at home with people around. I don’t want to fuck up my business either. It took years to get these accounts and build them up. Honestly the taper thing doesn’t really work for me. Yea I’d rather just be miserable for a month then drag this fuckin thing out over a year. I’m really scared. I’ve wanted to stop for at least a year as my tolerance has grown exponentially but I’m afraid of loosing everything I built up over the past 9 years and just keep raising my intake. I need help.

 Just keep dragging myself to work everyday. But it’s actually easier that way I think, because it keeps me busy. I usually like to stay very busy.

I was back in the gym last week several days, but this week I’m just so tired. I think the not eating is part of that, so I’ve been trying to force myself to eat more. 
I keep reminding myself that it took me months and months to get where I was, so it will take some time to feel like me again.  I’m down to 140-145lbs and just feel so frail. I was about 160-165 and muscular before K. 
Still peeing dirty for THC. I drink a gallon of water a day and I’m pretty active, considering all. Taking supplements and detox stuff too. I just feel like I’m walking down the longest tunnel, and I know there is an end, I just don’t know when.

I have taken 25-30 gpd in 3 doses every day for around 5 years. At first it really helped with feelings of depression and anxiety that I was having, but I over time, I began to feel those negative side effects that come along with addiction. I hate how I am always having to plan out my doses before hanging out with friends or family and oftentimes have to sneak off to a bathroom to throw back the green sludge. I was never a homebody but I have found myself preferring to stay home where I know I can comfortably get to my kratom rather than doing fun things with my friends (which is ironic because I originally took it to be more social and loose while out). I feel like I have the interests and hobbies that helped to define me. I used to hike and backpack, bike etc but these activities have taken a backseat to my hobby of drinking kratom. At work I feel that it has made me unmotivated and last but not least, I have a 1 year old son and wife, who I need to be 100% there for, and while I dont think I have been a bad father, on Kratom, I do not think raising a child, while having a multiple times a day kratom habit is  sustainable. I have lied to my wife more times than I can count and this has effected our relationship . 

For me, acutes are manageable . Its the weeks of depression and anxiety that always get me back to the head shop.

Hopefully this is valuable to someone regardless of where they are at in recovery. So here it goes.

**History:**

My history of abuse started my senior year in college, waaay back in 2012. A lot of dormant, internal problems erupted all at once. I was struggling with my sexuality, depression and anxiety reared their ugly heads, I hated what I was studying, and the stress of everything on my plate just overwhelmed me. It was at this time that I learned a really unfortunate lesson, alcohol could temporarily relieve me of these feelings. Before I knew it, I was drinking a fifth a day, completely disengaging from school, and isolating myself from my friends and family. I soon dropped out of college and just started skating by in life, drinking heavily the whole time. This lifestyle got me sent to the hospital twice and to a psych hospital once. My life, as AA likes to put it, had become completely unmanageable.

Then in the fall of 2018, what I thought was a miracle happened, I took my first dose of kratom and my urge to drink went away in almost an instant. I had found the antidote to my spiraling life. For a while it seemed like I was right. I went back to school and finished my degree, I got a great job soon after, and I had met someone I was head-over-heels for. But then I noticed that my doses were getting bigger and bigger. I was no longer just taking it in the evening to relax, but I was also taking it as soon as I got up and then again at lunch. And again, in what seemed like the blink of any eye, I was taking over 100 GPD. My bank accounts were perpetually overdrawn, my relationship was deteriorating, all my life aspirations were falling apart, and worst of all, the kratom made me feel fine with it all. I was numb to everything. So I decided to quit.

My first quit was about a year and a half after I had started dosing, and I made it three days CT. The acutes were unbearable and I quickly caved. So I thought I just needed to cut back and I'd be fine. I'd save money and I wouldn't be high all the time. I could manage my life with kratom as a part of it. Clearly that didn't work, I'm an addict after all. So six months later I tried to quit again. This time I thought I could get through the acutes if I could just drink alcohol to dull the pain. Absolutely horrible idea. Over the course of two nights, I killed around five fifths of hard alcohol. I'm incredibly lucky that my partner was able to get to me and take me to the hospital. As soon as I was out though, went straight back to kratom. A year goes by, and my life is in tatters. Relationship ends, no job, no money, and I'm abysmally depressed. I end up moving states and back in with my family. I tell them everything and we come up with a plan to taper. I couldn't do it, not even for a little bit (addict again). So a couple months later I go to detox. It was a really shitty program, and if I'm honest, I don't think I really wanted to quit. So I relapsed again two weeks later.

I can't explain how or why, but several month after my stint at detox, I woke up with the burning desire to be free of substances forever, no matter what. I knew the acutes were a huge obstacle so I found a new doctor and told her everything. I spilled my guts. They were very empathetic and we came up with a plan. I was prescribed gabapentin and signed up for an addiction program (an IOP which stands for intensive outpatient program). And on this last Christmas day, I took my last dose. The gabapentin helped me sail through the first couple days, and I thought I had finally cleared the hurdle. But then a series of family tragedies happened just as the PAWs set in. I had an extremely hard second week, but that burning desire to stay sober was still there. I started exercising, mediating, journaling, going to meetings, and everything I could to just get me to the next day. I was so glad I did, because by the third week all my symptoms were so much more manageable, and I felt happy again for the first time in almost ten years without the aid of booze or kratom. That feeling has kept going since then. Yes, there have been some lows too, but I'd take those feelings any day over feeling trapped by addiction. And now here I am pooping actual turds and sharing my story in pure bliss.

**What Worked:**

Gabapentin - A godsend for the acutes. Use it at the direction from your doctor. Stop after 4-5 days, and taper as you start to end it.

Mental Health Medication - Once I started my addiction program and before I quit, I was assigned to a person who could prescribe and manage medication. I had been on a whole pharmacy of meds in the past to varying degrees of success. This time, however, I tried something new and it's been extremely effective. I'm on Wellbutrin and Lexapro, then Seroquel for sleep. Everyone responds to meds differently so work with your doctor or addiction psychiatrist to find the right combo for you.

Exercise - Don't want to beat a dead horse too much, since this is always recommended, but it seriously does so much good. Just do whatever you can to get your heart pumping for 20 minutes, and you'll feel amazing afterward.

Meditation - Again a common suggestion. I meditate for 10-15 minutes three times daily, and I always am in a much better mood after I do it. I use a guided mediation app called Headspace which works well for me, but there's tons of other options out there. I had a really good experience with an app called Sanvello too, and at least in my state, you can use Medicaid to pay for the premium version.

Rituals and Routines - Having a morning and evening routine has helped with the cravings, especially because the morning and evening were the times I would dose the most. I also try to create a ritual around rewarding myself in both the morning and evening with something I enjoy to eat and drink. In the morning it's toast with coffee, and in the evening its hot cocoa or tea.

Individual Therapy - Having someone to talk to and work through feelings with and really understands addiction and mental health issues is so helpful. They can help you develop strategies and tools to get you through cravings and triggers. My therapist does DBT therapy along with CBT therapy and that combo has been very effective for me.

Group Therapy/AA and NA Meetings - Group therapy is wonderful, though my groups happen over Zoom, so they lose a little bit of their effectiveness that I think you'd get in person. It's a great way to keep yourself accountable and to remind yourself that you are not alone in this journey. Now AA and NA are a bit complicated for me. I absolutely loooooove the people and meetings. They are such a great dose of perspective and you'll always find unconditional love and support in those rooms. However, I haaaaaate the Big Book and am not too fond of the twelve steps for a number of reasons. I'm still working the steps with a sponsor but it's definitely a process right now. Another caveat here is that I go to queer and LGBTQ recovery groups, which as you might imagine have pretty generous interpretations of a lot of the things AA and NA suggest.

This Sub - For many of the reasons above. It keeps you accountable. There's nothing but support here. There's great suggestions. And it's also very therapeutic to  get your thoughts down and work through them with other people.

Hot Showers and Masturbation - For immediate relief, these are my go to. You'll get a rush of endorphins and feel good for at least a little bit of time. As I've had more sober days under my belt, I need them less and less, but still love a good shower and wank every now and then ;)

**What Hasn't Worked:**

Supplements - I know this might be controversial, but for me, none of the suggested supplements seemed to do much. I recognize that I have an addict brain, and that if something doesn't work right away or get me high, then I consider it useless. So maybe they did work, and I was just too fucked up to notice it. Either way though your mileage will vary here.

Kava - I want to call this one out in particular. I tried it because many people had recommended it for anxiety and sleep. This one did get me high, and that freaked me out. I also had a huge panic attack as I came down from it. It's always hard to tell what causes what when you're going through withdrawals, but I did not have a good time with Kava.

The Big Book of AA - This books was written in the 30s, and that is very apparent from the get go. This book should have stayed in the 30s. Lots of people find strength in it, but it was definitely not for me.

**Books I'd Recommend and Final Thoughts:**

I've read a couple books that have helped me so I thought I'd share them with you. *Man's Search for Meaning* by Viktor Frankl, *Mindset* by Carol Dweck, *The Tao of Pooh* by Benjamin Hoff, *Atomic Habits* by James Clear.

I'm sure I'm leaving lots out, but I'm an open book and am happy to elaborate on anything I've shared here. Please feel free to DM me anytime or chat with me here in the comments.

I have a long way to go still, but feel more resolve than I ever have had before.  You all too can get here. I hope you can take away something from my story, but I really believe that recovery is a deeply personal experience. You have to find what works for you and what doesn't and unfortunately that can take a lot of trial and error. But when it clicks, oh man is it a magical feeling. You will learn a lot about yourself on the way, more than most people ever will, and when you come out on the other side you will be stronger than ever before. You can do this, you might stumble, you might relapse, and things might seem incredibly hopeless, but as long as you keep that desire for a better sober life, you will get there eventually, I promise.

I'm new here and just looking for community support and connection while I taper.

My story is a long one but in short, I recovered from a heavy pain killer pills addiction but after about a year I started using Kratom. For the last two years I've been taking the extract capsules, about 1-2 a day. I'm ready to quit because I hate the feeling of being dependent on anything and I feel like it's really affected my personality, decreased my motivation overall, and just doesn't allow me to fully be human with all of the emotions of pain and pleasures.

I take 1-2 capsules of the extract a day. I take a dose as soon as I wake up (I open up the capsules and take like 1/3 or 1/2 at a time). I wake up really groggy and tired and just feeling so blah every day. The krarom helps get me out of the morning ""funk"" and ready to start the day. I have a young kid and I hate waking up annoyed and without patience for him. I want to wake him up with breakfast and kisses and smiles, but  if don't take Kratom in the morning, I'm miserable and irritable. I feel like he doesn't deserve that, so I excuse my use by telling myself it makes me a ""better mom"". Really I just hate sitting in the irritability that I get without it.

Mid-morning at work, I start getting really irritable and annoyed. My coworkers are great and I don't want to be irritable with them either. So I excuse my use again.

After work, I pick up my son and we go to the park, we have fun bath time routine, we have bedtime routine. So I use again then to help me stay present and engaged with him instead of tired and miserable.

This cycle has been so hard to break because I feel like I'm not the only one that suffers from my withdrawals. I don't want it to affect my son. I'm a very anxious person and the Kratom helped with that.

I understand Im just in a use/withdrawl loop and have to make the jump. I want to know what I'm like again without any opiates in my mind. I want to remember what I use to enjoy and what brings me peace that doesn't come in a pill form. I don't enjoy anything anymore unless krater is involved. 

Always needing to have some on me is also so stressful.

I've been on some sort of opiate since 2015 when I broke my back, and I've been dealing with chronic pain ever since. I've been on kratom for two years and have finally decided now's the time to quit. I initially worked out a methadone plan with my doctor, in part to treat withdrawals but mainly for pain management, but since I was experiencing bad emotional problems during the switch anyway, I decided to just stop all opiates altogether.

So what I'm wondering is, how do I deal with my back pain? I expect that it might get better after the initial withdrawals start to fade and as the hyperalgesia improves, but I'm not sure what to do in the meantime.

I'm hoping to start exercising more consistently as part of dealing with my withdrawals and trying to stay busy, but I'm nervous that that might be really painful.

I did a cold turkey withdrawal back in December of 2019 and honestly it wasn’t near as bad as I thought it would be. I stayed off kratom for a year and then started back using January 2021.

Its been rough, I will say, definitely was feeling pretty bad with the PAWS & an overwhelming sense of emptiness & depression. I am sleeping better than I was when I first quit, at this point probably sleeping too much due to the depression but it is what it is.

I think for the most part I should be over the worst of the PAWS, but my mind is still very f*cked up. I have no energy, im so tired, feel hopeless & useless. But I know its just my brain adjusting to the lack of serotonin, dopamine & endorphins that it was dumping non stop during my 7 year daily kratom use... abuse. 

I'm not going to give up, I'm not going back to this crap. If anything, all this shit has reminded me how horrible this poison was for my body, mind & soul. I just remind myself that getting this poison out of my life will make me a better mom to my amazing son.

Now I listen to music while I work. I really appreciate music so much now that I'm not on kratom. I've been trying to walk or workout a little. Trying to be patient with myself. This community has saved me during these last 16 days. No one in my life knows what I'm going through as no one else got into kratom, but having all your stories & support has saved me. 

Hang in there friends! We can all do this, just do not give up! Listen to music, rest, be patient with the process & do your best to push through. As they say the only way out of the fire is through. 💜",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.876852810382843}"

I was on the phone with my wife when it happend and she heard my shoes squeaking and my gasps for air. Now she's also lost me for 2 days because I overdosed on the side of a highway a little over a year ago. Few months prior to that I chopped my arm up pretty good and got myself taken to a psych ward by the cops. I also have 2 other overdoses before we came into eachother lives. So it's safe to say I've put this girl through a lot. First time I detoxed and stayed sober I was on 16 mg of suboxone and 8mg of xanax daily for 5+ years and lemme tell ya that shit takes a full month to kick and the anxiety oh my fucking lord I felt like I had shrink wrap around my brain for months. I expected this kratom to be a cakewalk as I've detoxed from oxy, subs, xans, alcohol, coke, adderall. I'm an addict of opportunity as many are. For the first time ever though I can look at my little daughter and and my wife and see all that kratom was taking away. Sure I could work and function but I was a shell of who I was as many of you share the feeling I'm sure. I thought this drug was finally my way out from all the other drugs which idk about any of you but it's not easy to raise a family when you're taking trips to the pysch ward and emergency room every few months. Anywho I'm still not sleeping until about 5 am but my wife is really picking up all my slack. Not the hardest detox but man this stuff really kicked my ass. If I can do it so can you I promise. Just remember in those almost irresistible moments of thinking you can't do it anymore that it will pass. You're all strong and you got this.

As a life long cannabist, always after work, not the whole day, never saw that as a problem, used some other stuff, always in control, have a job , a family, no problem.

few years ago i got a hernia, pain , got oxycodone, i know the stuff, i am a nurse. 8 weeks on the couch, netflix and oxy, i really liked it, but was well aware of the dangers, so taperd down to nothing hernia gone, pain gone, back to life.  This however planted the seeds for a renewed liking for drugs and changed the boundaries i always kept. 

i read about kratom and curious i orderd some, legal in the Netherlands, it felt almost like oxycodone, it felt really good. We all know what happens here i think, in a year i used almost daily, and experienced an unnatural tiredness on the days i didnt use, oops. i decided to quit for a month, january 2020. That was no problem, i missed it but i didnt do it. on the 27th of that month, puberty of my youngest daughter hit me in the face with a battlehammer, she was depressed, suicidal, cut her arms and legs, i was shocked. 

So i started using kratom daily from that moment on, 30-40 grams per day till 19 january 2022, last summer i started professionel help, i taperd down to 10 grams a day, but situation at home became more stressfull i relapsed. last week 19-january i went in rehab, cold turkey. scared as hell and yes sleep is not so good, but i sleep, i have some cramps in arms and legs when i lie in bed, but thats it.

So is it possible that withdrawal hell still has to start, or is this very very mild withdrawal possible whit 2 years continuos use of 35 grams a day. i dont even have cravings, or very very mild ones, and i am so clear, i feel, i FEEL again, and i didnt even knew that i didnt felt anymore, love, music, this is so good.",13,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9810439944267273}"

The mind’s ability to convince you to try occasional use when you rationally know it will never just be occasional and the end result is misery is remarkable.  I feel like the biggest idiot especially when I look back at my old comments warning people about the evils of Kratom. It’s crazy. The whole time I was relapsing I knew how awful this shit is but the fear or what the withdrawals would be like again kept me using for months longer than I ever thought possible.  My memory was garbage and I noticed myself withdrawing from friends and activities I previously enjoyed. I think exhaustion with the pandemic and the social isolation that has come with it played a role in my dumb decision to start back up.  Stupid. 

I know from my last quit what to expect and it’s sucked just as much as the last time. Overwhelming anxiety, restlessness, GI issues, inability to sleep, temperature irregulation, RLS from hell, extreme sadness, etc. 

The only things that really seem to help are exercise, hot baths, music (it finally connects again!), masturbation, and thc to help sleep. And time, of course. 

Day 1 - wasn’t awful until it was bedtime and then I tossed and turned all night. Heating pad and thc help a bit. 

Days 2-4 - Physical and mental misery. Maybe a few hours of sleep each night.  

Day 5 - 5 pounds lighter. Forced myself to exercise which helped mostly in distracting me from spending all day in my head.

Unfortunately I made it back to taking kratom after a 6 month break. I've been using about 10-12 gpd for the past year or so.

I take 1.5g when I wake up (between 430am and 5am), then 1.5g around noon, 1.5g around 4pm-5pm, and then 2.5g at bed (9pm or 10pm)

I quit a few years ago from 35gpd. I did that CT and I don't want to go through that again. I'd like to taper down to 0 or as low as possible before it doesn't benefit to taper anymore. I don't feel terrible during the day. The first 2 days going from the 10-12 down to 7 I felt a little anxiety, and woke up for brief periods in the night feeling excited. But managed to go back to sleep with not much of a problem. Starting the 3rd day on the lower dose I have felt great since then, but still would like to quit.

Noticing increased symptoms since last week,"TL;DR: Seeking advice from those with experience tapering...Is it better to taper by numbers of grams, or percentage of weight?  Or do symptoms possibly intensify as you finish a taper?

**Backstory:** As of tomorrow I'll have been tapering for 2 full months.  For about 18 months I was using what I consider to be a lot of kratom - 25-30gpd (I understand that's not heavy compared to some, but I was having a lot of side effects from my usage).  Through some life changes and by going on a busy vacation where I had much less time to take kratom, I reduced to 15gpd.

I began my taper two months ago, at 15 gpd.  The first week was the hardest, with some anhedonia in addition to my personal nemesis, restless legs.  I then dropped to 12gpd the second week, and definitely had more w/d symptoms.

Since those first 2 weeks, the taper process has been pretty kind, and gentle, and I've started to have some ""good days,"" and a pretty recurrent pattern of first 2-3 days restless legs, then no more restless legs, and starting to feel great by day 5-6 of the week, and then it comes time to drop again.

I'm just wrapping up a week at only 2 GPD.  I'm psyched about that, I'm so close to done!  But also, this week was a LOT harder somehow!  I suffered restless legs every night of the week except one (and it wasn't last night, meaning I thought they were gone, and they came back, and I've had to take ""double"" the stuff I use to manage them (like the Hyland's tablets or Dopa Mucuna), and I've had terrible insomnia.  Last ""night"" I didn't fall asleep until 8 AM.  And I'm taking different sleep aids at midnight each night and not falling asleep until 4, 5, 6, etc.  So they're not really working.

**My detailed questions**:

1. Could I be experiencing increased symptoms because the ""percentage"" of grams I dropped from last week (last week I was at 4 GPD, this week I'm at 2 GPD) is much higher than any other week?  (I've listed my complete taper schedule with grams and percentages below).  I wouldn't think it would matter now that my GPD are so low!  I can think of no other lifestyle changes that might be bringing on this terrible insomnia.  But maybe my system is still really ""detoxing"" from nearly 2 years of regular use.
2. Are these increased symptoms likely to continue as I ""finish up,"" and would they be less if I decreased the percentage drop and slowed down just a little?  Next week I had planned to drop by 50% again, from 2 gpd to 1 gpd, and then stop completely the following Monday.  I'm eager to finish up ASAP, but at the same time, I'm not eager to suffer.\*  I've been doing great with the process, I haven't been ""tempted"" at all, I already did one ""pause"" holding steady at 6 gpd when I got really sick and there was a terrible winter storm in my area, and when my health and situation improved I resumed right on schedule.
   1. \*I have a really hard time with insomnia.  I'm sure I'm not alone, but I've been through a PAWS experience (not from kratom) a few years ago where I didn't sleep more than an hour a night for 6 months, and it was a living nightmare. Because of that specifically, insomnia stresses me out terribly, especially when it seems like it's not going away. I'm not remotely eager to throw my body into a high cortisol state and I would much rather take just a little longer to finish if it means less suffering.  On the other hand, if this is just the way the taper and quitting process ends, because kratom sucks like that, well, okay, I'll get myself ready for that.

It sounds a lot like I'm talking myself into slowing things down, but I would still love to hear anyone's thoughts.  I suppose an alternative would be to take more sleep meds for a bit (my dosages are pretty low).

Thank you all, sending you all much support!  Overall this process has been very good and much less scary or hard than I thought it would be!  Just don't want that to change as I finish up (if I can help it).

**My taper schedule (Mostly I've been been dropping by 2 gpd each week):**

* Week 1 - 15 gpd
* Week 2 - 12 gpd (Drop: 3gpd, 20% from previous week) - moderately intense symptoms
* Week 3 - 10 gpd (Drop: 2gpd, 17% from previous week) - moderate symptoms
* Week 4 -   8 gpd (Drop: 2gpd, 20% from previous week) - starting to feel better, mild symptoms
* Week 5 -   6 gpd (Drop: 2gpd, 25% from previous week) - mild symptoms, feeling pretty good
* *Week 6 & 7 - 6 gpd. Paused due to being very sick and crazy snowstorm (no power or running water for 12 days)*
* Week 8 -  4 gpd  (Drop: 2 gpd, 33% from previous week) - mild symptoms, feeling pretty good
* Week 9 -  2 gpd  (Drop: 2 gpd, **50% from previous week**) - intense insomnia, restless legs.  Still feeling many of the other benefits of being so low in kratom use - elevated mood and energy).
* (Next week, original plan) Week 10 - 1 gpd (Drop: 1 gpd, 50% from previous week)

This is about the 4th day 1 quit post of mine...  
I quit for the third time in the beginning of December.   
I managed to not use any for about 2,5 weeks.   
After that I had a pretty intense craving, while downplaying its effects.   
I caved, and told myself I could keep using with break day in between.  
I started out using 3/4 days a week, but after a while I was on it again pretty much every day.  
It makes me feel so good, but I feel way too stuck to it. I forget the addiction for a while when using it, but generally when I'm using Kratom is on my mind 24/7 and it's just terrible.   
It's so so addictive to me, feel like a total slave.   


So the main withdrawal symptoms are starting to kick in from about 10gpd. I feel uncomfortable, but resilient. It's not all that bad so far, honestly, I can do this.   
I really want to make it this time. It would empower me a lot to know I can do this on my own.   
I definitely don't trust myself fully yet though. Sadly, I can kind of see myself making excuses and buying some even tomorrow... Do any of you have any tips from keeping me from doing that?  


I would be so proud and happy if I can leave this behind forever, and all of you should be as well.  
My best wishes to all of you, and I am thankful for this sub.",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5044879913330078}"

These past 9 days have been a real struggle. Everyday has been a mental battle with depression and cravings; but so far I've stayed true to my plan of quitting. But my lymph node is still swollen even after 9 days. So I'm wondering if anyone had a similar experience with quitting kratom and lymph nodes.

What did it for me was, I was down to like 6 - 7 grams a day on a LONG taper (was taking 30g a day), and I was getting close to making the jump and I got covid. Of course, my addict brain said ""You don't want to be having bad withdrawal symptoms while battling covid"" so I upped my dose back up a bit. This worked fine for a couple of days, but then I started getting just horrific stomach and reflux issues from the Kratom. I knew it was time to end this madness.

3. I’m able to hold food down this time! I don’t have an appetite much, but eating has made me feel so much better. And when I feel like I can’t eat, I got a couple of soylents.

So I have been waiting in line since August to start Spravato for my treatment resistant depression. Timing is bad bc I am tapering kratom and am currently sitting at 5gpd and the anxiety is pretty bad. So my question is should I stop my taper while going thru the Spravato treatments? I had a treatment yesterday and bc of the anxiety it wasn’t very pleasant. If I stop the Spravato treatment I’ll likely be put at the bottom of the list again or worse just kicked off completely. 

I thought maybe for awhile I could find a stable dose which is prolly around 7-8gpd until I get thru the other treatment. Of course I know the kratom itself is likely a part of why I am depressed. I feel kinda screwed here. My highest kratom dose was anywhere between 20-30gpd. So some progress has been made.

My kratom dependency started around 2 years ago, and since then I've been on and off of kratom several times.  I'm currently off kratom, and have been for maybe 4 months now.  Before that, I was off kratom for around 10 months to a year.  

Since going down the kratom rabbit hole, I've noticed that my hair has been thinning extremely fast over the past two years.  Even when I was off of kratom for almost a year, my hair continued to get thinner.  Over two years, my hair went from extremely thick, to noticeably thin.

I've only been on other medications fairly recently.  Currently, I'm taking Suboxone and Gabapentin, but I doubt it's because of those meds.  Over my 10 month break, I took zero prescription drugs, only psychedelics and supplements.  Nothing crazy.  Definitely nothing that could cause this to happen.

Has this happened to anyone else?  I've heard from plenty of people that their hair started to grow back after quitting, but it seems like my hairloss is more or less permanent.  I've also been having pretty severe dandruff/dry scalp.  I'll run my fingers through what's left of my hair, and a lot of hair and flakes come showering down (sorry I know it's fucking gross).

This is the first time I decided to quit nicotine at the same time and so far it seems like a good choice. The typical withdrawal symptoms are about 20-30% worse so far but as long as this is the final quit it will be well worth it.

One thing I've noticed which always brings me to relapse is my Mothers cancer getting worse as she is running out of options. I would use kratom to numb that specific pain but ended up with many other problems on top of the main one. I feel like life is passing by rapidly as I am turning 27 and not where I want to be in life. I can attribute drug use as one of the only things that I can control.

First thank you all so much for being here and contributing great content, it really inspired me and helps me not feel so alone. I wish I could meet all of you beautiful souls! ❤️ last fall I tried CT and went about 10 days and caved. I am in a doctorate program and it is super stressful and I’m incredibly busy. During that 10 days I took a few days off of internship and told people I was sick. I had NO idea id gave withdrawal symptoms for so long and day 10 didn’t feel promising as I was sweating like crazy, freezing cold, still couldn’t sleep and I just couldn’t handle it with my busy schedule. 

I wanted to CT over Christmas break when I went home (where I live with my bf) but I was so afraid he would not be supportive and need me to be active and myself during the holidays. 

I have decided I need to taper. Really wanna be off this shit. Only started in the first place because USPS was taking forever to ship me kava from California (I’m in South Dakota for grad school). I should have done my research I guess and no one told me it was so physically addictive. I have been sober off alcohol for almost 6 years so the addict in me was taking a lot of Kratom for awhile before I realized what it was doing to my body and how dependent I would become. 

My body is really failing, I’m severely anemic (taking iron now) and women are prone to anemia to begin with let alone the fact that Kratom depletes it even more. Well I have a reason ti eat lots of steak now 😝. Constipation is so bad Some days that I am very worried I’m giving myself polyps, which can be precursor to colon cancer. 

I told myself it’s fine that I’m numb all the time because I’m miserable in grad school and in the Midwest. BUT I get to move back to Cali permanently in 105 days and have secured my dream residency at home and I am SO ready to be happy and excited about life again and not just living to complete assignments and research with no recognition. I will soon be seeing patients full time! 

So I just went and bought a scale and some condiment cups. I’ve read through the taper guide and I’m creating myself a schedule. Going to weigh how much I’m actually taking and divide it out into portions in the condiment cups to have throughout the day. 

The last 10 days I’ve been taking only as much as I need to feel okay once every 12 hours. Which has been tough! I really think keeping an even steady intake throigh the day will help a lot. I start to struggle a few hours after a dose. It’s odd, some days I can go 12 hours, others not even 2. 

Anyway thanks for reading. We can do this. If we can suffer through the side effects while using we can handle some discomfort while detoxing 💖",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9948574304580688}"

I have to push through.,"So, I already stopped kratom once few years ago, got into it again. This time, I am at MUCH higher dose (25gpd, I am 115 pounds woman) taking it half a year. 

Previously I quit CT and I experienced little of the symptoms ppl are describing here - but I feel like shit and have insomnia in general, so I don't think I would even notice something like sweats or stomach ache etc
 BUT there's one symptom, and it made the experience living hell on earth - groin tingling. 

Sounds weird but it fucking sucks. It's almost as if my uterus is spasming instantly, dull ache, tingly feeling, only relieved by movement. I suspect that it's some form of RLS. Last time this lasted a week and I only got some sleep thanks to benzos.

This time around, I have no benzos & much higher dose to quit. It makes me so scared, I've been putting off quitting for two months now. If anyone experienced this and has any advice or words of encouragement, please, tell me. 

I am at that point where I can feel slight tingling each morning before taking my first dose and it is already sending me straight into anxiety mode. For a week, I am planning to take few grams each morning & night, thinking about 8 gpd, and then I am gonna go for CT. Hopefully my resolve to actually do it will last this time. I am on sick leave so I can afford to feel miserables and not sleep all night - there will be no better time in my life to stop.

It still sucks, but I'm feeling a bit more confident that I can make it through this, one day at a time. I have a bunch of questions for this community, though, if you'd be kind enough to indulge me.

I just got my shipment of black seed oil. What dose should I take, and how much is safe to take? I've glanced over some encouraging academic literature about black seed oil for long-term treatment of things like kratom dependence. How has this worked out for you folks on the front lines?

Also, I need to find something to address my anxiety and irritability. Right now, the withdrawals are making that worse, I'm sure. But it's a problem I had long before I started taking kratom (I'd say it's the main reason I turned to kratom, tbh). During these first 7 days of CT, I've told myself that it's OK to double my prescribed clonazepam dose, but I know it's not something I can do for much longer than that without getting myself in trouble with benzo dependence. I have a long history of practicing meditation (even lived at a Buddhist monastery for a while), so I know how effective that can be. But with work and a child, it's hard for me to maintain the kind of regular meditation schedule that keeps me on an even keel. 

I quit kratom 5 days ago so my son's mother wouldn't have any grounds to deny me 50% custody of our son. But I'm scared that, while going off kratom will protect me in court, that it'll make me a more irritable dad - which is the last thing I want to put my son through.

I was probably up to 35 grams a day at my highest. I was first taking kratom after I got home from the work and the gym as a reward. This moved to once during the day and once after work. Eventually it turned to every few hours. It took about 3 years until I realized I was physically, possibly probably emotionally addicted to the drug only after traveling to Japan for 2 weeks. I had not brought the kratom with me in case there was any issues at customs, not knowing the extent of my addiction. Japan was pretty miserable. I slept maybe 2 hours a night after walking 5 - 10 + miles a day site seeing. At first I thought it was jet lag but towards the end I came to realize it was WD. I got back from Japan and definitely was experiencing some PAWS. I got right back into the kratom. 

As I said its been 5 years and in October I decided I was sick and tired of being dependent on this drug  and I say drug because thats exactly what it is. I bought a scale and started to taper. I think I went from about 25 grams to 20 then to 15 then 12 then to 10 then to 7 now im at 5. Some nights I would wake up tossing and turning with RLS feeling like I want to jump out of my skin. Usually I would go weigh out .5 G and wash it down to get back to sleep. I wake up forgive myself and push on keeping myself accountable. Im usually dosing a few doses in the am and during the day and then saving a larger dose for when im home relaxing before bed. That time and the weekends seem to be the toughest. If there's any advise I can give its to 100% get a scale .. do not eyeball it. The kratom can compact on a spoon and you can get 15 grams on it or more if you wanted. cant cheat the scale. 

Inadvertantly going through a cold turkey in Japan I would say this will deffinitly not be for most people. It was pretty fuckin miserable. Get a scale, GO SLOW, stay accountable. Good luck",17,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982365369796753}"

I start taking Kratom for about 5 Years ago, just for fun. I had no addiction to other substance in the past and now. Never tried anything ecept a few times weed, but I never liked it.

After the first years i start to took it daily. I quit it a few times CT, and want to go back to ""take it sometimes"",  but that never worked, as you can imagine.

In the last two years during the pandemic, i start to take a lot more than before, before i always take the first dose after work, and now i start taking it in the morning. In 2020 and 2021 i had no thoughts to quit it, but during the turn of the last year i decided to quit that green powder forever.

The last two weeks i have done a fast taper from 30-35 grams to 10 grams now.

1. First week off to 15 grams took the first dose only at the evening, (Very hard)

2. Second week (this week now) 10 grams first dose only at the evening. (A few times hard)

I very enjoy this clearness durnig the day.

I have booked a four-day short vacancy in 3 weeks to kick it off.

How should i go on with tapering? I have 3 weeks left. I´m very afraid of the physiological  WDs and want to get as less as possible of them!? Any ideas?

I don't remember the dosing but it was fairly high for both Gaba and Vyve. Remember to not dose too high on the Gabapentin because if you go past like 2100 mg it could exacerbate the symptoms of WD.

I started using kratom full time after every meal at the age of 23 when I quit opiates. The Kratom sank its hooks into me for far longer than the actual drugs I was (at one time) addicted to.

I finally did it. After EIGHTEEN months of tapering, I jumped off. And outside of some mild physical withdrawal symptoms and some moderate mood swings, I can officially say I’ve been off of Kratom fully now for 3 whole days. This is a landmark for me, I have taken this crap 6 times a day every single day uninterrupted since Christmas 2015. 

I haven’t even had to take a single day off of work coming off of this stuff. Better than I could’ve imagined. I am not taking any replacement drug or assisting medication outside of ashwagandha for my anxiety, which I already took before I leaped. 

I started tapering sometime in mid 2020. I started losing hair and gaining weight (I took Kratom after every meal). Kratom always made my blood sugar drop so I had to take it with food. I was taking huge doses for long periods of time- 12-13 capsules of klarity (+/-750mg/cap). I was hypersensitive to opiate withdrawal symptoms back in the day so I was mortified of having to quit this stuff too, so I decided to allow my body as much time to adjust to the lowering doses as possible. Long story short, I got down to 2 capsules 6 times a day and yet the ill-effects Kratom was causing me got worse. So I started cutting out doses entirely, down to three times a day, then two, then one…

Now we’re here! 

It is still very early but I feel a great deal of power and control over my circumstances. I exerted an amount of self control I didn’t even know I had, to reach this point unassisted. Thank you to the people of this sub who post their positive stories that gave me the inspiration to be like you! Can’t wait to hit day 7!",12,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5766578912734985}"

1. This sub helped me quit Kratom. I quit on 5/20/20. I will cherish the support and shared experiences from here forever. 
2. I never had delayed withdrawal. I still believe it's easy to confuse that with the emotional problems that led us to kratom to begin with. I used it to hide from fear. Find your courage in all things.
3. The number one thing that helped me break kratom was to exercise first thing in the morning. If you want to quit you need to change a behavior. This is my single best piece of advice. Exercise first thing in the morning. No supplement, no tea is going to help you more.
4. I don't miss it it all. Not even a little bit.
5. Don't be hard on yourself
6. Withdrawal was real and awful, but it's not the same for everyone. A friend of mine used much higher doses that I and he kicked it like it was nothing. I was at 15GPD and had 11 days of misery. Certainly didn't help that it was May 2020. Fuck you Twenty Twenty. I love you Twenty Twenty.

Most of the posts on this forum are success stories where people feel fine after 3-5 months of quitting and it is a bit harder to find details from people who suffered prolonged Kratom withdrawals. So I'm hoping some of you who can relate would share their experience here.

 Sober life can be quite rough sometimes but it gets better, as long as you keep chasing your dreams and not ducking from  your responsibilities you can alleviate much of the dread and pain that is life. There's a lot of beauty to be found in carrying your burdens and facing your demons, facing your fears. You become a stronger person, a better person, someone you can look up to. Someone you never thought possible to be. We are much more resilient and capable of growth than we sometimes are willing to admit to ourselves.

As for the mental battle, I see kratom in every gas station, and minus the fleeting thought of, ""just once"", it currently holds no weight in my mind, this is my second quit and I have more than learned my lesson of ""just once will be ok, you can control yourself"", that's just a flat out falsehood. The bouncing between heavy anxiety and heavy depression is exhausting, but I know it will improve steadily as I reclaim my healthy lifestyle. 

I'll be starting weekly 1-1 talk therapy sessions on February 1st. One thing that has really resonated with me is that I was using Kratom to numb a lot of unprocessed traumas, I've had a rough go at life thus far, and just because I've gotten clean, and am pursuing sobriety, doesn't mean my problems are suddenly gone, they are there, and I have to deal with them, to break the cycle.

I know this one was a bit of a ramble, that just comes with the mental territory I'm in currently, hope you all have a great day, cheers.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8935196399688721}"

I'm fairly new to kratom. I only discovered it in mid october while going through paws from almost a decade long addiction to tramadol and also while in paws from pregablin which I used to quit tramadol. Since then I've taken it at most 16 days straight, but most days since mid october I've still been on kratom, even though I've taken shorter breaks to not get fully hooked. At first 5-6 day breaks, then they got to about 1-3 days max off of it before needing to refill. 

Now I'm at a point that I can tell I'm physically dependant on it. I'm 3 days CT off 25 grams a day... last time the wd after 2 weeks straight use was only around 2 days of moderate discomfort, a bit of chills, sweats and some runny nose and eyes and no apetite, but this quickly resolved and in about 4-9 days I was basically fine. Not 100, but fine. I could still sleep. 

This time however I only used for a week, but the wd was worse starting immediately. For the past 3 days I can hardly sleep, I get 7 hrs but wake up so much it feels like three. I have diarrhea, I can hardly eat though I force myself, Im both freezing and too hot. Its basically opiate wd, though very mild compared to what Im used to from the past. Mentally its not unbareable like with stronger stuff, but its enough that it really bothers me because its severe enough that my bodily functions are out of order, even if I can take the mental aspect, I can tell Im now dependant on it. 

Thats part of the problem though that Im used to alot worse than this. I came off 2100 mg's of pregablin. Arguably the worst comedown of all drugs. A girl in a different support group said coming off H and benzos at the same time was easier. And I went through that while still doing a 9-5 in acute wd. Compared to that, kratom is a walk in the park. So I dont really fear it like I do the others, and that makes me afraid in a different way - my point was never to trade one for another, and thats what Ive done now. And I know if I keep this up, soon enough I'll have full blown opiate wd just from this, and it'll be as bad as Im used to from before.

Even worse I have 110 g's in my mailbox today. I still have it unopened and its calling me every second. Just one hit and I can eat, not be cold and stop going to the bathroom constantly. The thing is though this crap doesnt even work anymore, I take a hit and 1 hr later have anxiety, a racing heart and mood swings. Its not like in the beginning where it killed all that the whole day and actually worked. Its turned on me.

I need help. Im close to a full blown hard addiction to this stuff if I keep this up just for a while longer.

It's not really directed towards anything, but it is such a powerful emotion that I've directed it towards bettering myself. I've been lifting, taking cold showers, and many other things that I wouldn't imagine doing on a regular basis. It doesn't seem to be dissipating in intensity like my anxiety did, for example. I have a feeling that it's a part of me that I kept locked away, a part of me that absolutely despised what I had become. I will admit though, I absolutely hate feeling weak and pathetic. I really, really fucking hate it. I want to charge ahead the way I have been so far and never look back. I've never really been the type of person to be determined, but that has changed.

I’m writing this for others who are having a hard time with quitting because of a lukewarm animosity to kratom and subsequently a lukewarm resolve towards actually quitting this plant...because that was me. Tried tapering multiple times to no avail because there was still a part of me that loved kratom, despite knowing that quitting was in my best interest...I used kratom for 2.5 years and ended a 30-50 gpd habit CT by allowing my kratom addiction to become something so fucking annoying, inconvenient and exhausting to me that I eventually built up such pure hatred for it and the effects it had on my life. December 17th (33 days ago) was the date I picked at the beginning of October to quit CT because of a long amount of time off from work I knew I’d have (holiday leave) to deal with acute withdrawals. From the beginning October to December 17th I allowed the cravings, sneaking around to dose, sneaking off to the headshop, zombie-like affect, etc. to manifest as they would. By the time my quit date came around I was just so fucking tired of all of these habits, and the loss of control that they made me feel. The rose colored glasses for kratom I had were gone. During the worst of my withdrawals I’d look back with such disgust at who kratom made me and how kratom made me feel that I didn’t fucking care about the withdrawals. I knew they’d pass. I’d allowed myself to get as excessive as I could with K that there was no mystery in my mind as to what turning back to it would entail. I know this is a rant, but I wanted to put this out there for others who may have a similar disposition...

The withdrawals are nasty if you don't taper properly, but they PALE in comparison to benzodiazepine withdrawals, so at least feel lucky you don't have to go through that.

For myself, I never have problems as long as I keep my daily use below 5 grams.

Decided to do a New Years detox off of everything from sugar to cannabis to Kratom.

I will be tapering at 0.25-0.5 grams per day, which will have me completely off in 1-2 weeks with almost no significant withdrawal effects; will miss a few hours of sleep per night and MAY have some runny stools, other than that I'm gravy.

I'm currently on my 5th day. I read the guide and learned about PAWS and the withdrawal symptoms which gave me helpful perspective. Because of the diarrhea, runny nose, sneezing, insomnia, and muscle aches, I was paranoid that I had COVID; but now I know it was just the withdrawals. I used kratom daily for about 2 1/2 years, with a few short breaks here and there that lasted anywhere from 1 day to a week. I averaged 8 - 15 gpd. There are many reasons I have for quitting, I'm sure they've all been mentioned on here before. The main reason for me was I felt like a slave to kratom. I had to have it just to feel normal. The Euphoria that kratom gave me was long gone. I was constantly struggling with hydration levels, because instead of drinking water, I would drink kratom. I noticed I was getting injured more often while weightlifting, which I think was due to my kratom use. My stress tolerance was also dramatically lower than usual, and I experienced mood swings. One day I would feel very optimistic and happy, then the next day I would have severe depression. My complexion was degrading; people started telling me I looked exhausted all the time. What put me over the edge, and finally made me quit was primarily two things: tachycardia and a swollen lymph node in my neck. It usually happened when I laid down to go to sleep, my heart would race so bad that I would have to sit up in bed and do long, slow, deep breathing. A very uncomfortable, scary feeling. Despite this, my addiction was so bad that I kept taking kratom. Then eventually I noticed a swollen lymph in the ride side of my neck. I learned that other people have experienced this from this subreddit, and that the swelling went away for most after about a week of abstinence. I tried tapering several times without success. I would always get down to 3 gpd, then succumb to the craving and just go back to my normal dosage. So for me, cold turkey was the way. The first day without kratom was surprisingly easy. I was motivated to quit, and felt pretty normal. The second day, and especially the second night, was by far the worst. Throughout the day I was very depressed, and cried several times. Then that night I experienced severe muscle aches and spasms. If there was a camera watching me in bed that night, viewers might have thought I was possessed from the writhing, tossing and turning. It was a radiating pain in my shoulders/upper back that would come in waves. It took me about 3 hours to fall asleep that night. Days 3 and 4 were milder. I still experienced flu-like symptoms, but they were beginning to subside. I've been managing the withdrawal symptoms with lots of tea and exercise. When it get's really bad, I'll have a glass of wine or a delta-8 edible. My ultimate goal is to be straight-edge, but my priority right now is to just eliminate kratom. I originally started consuming kratom because it helped my social anxiety. I made friends, and had a lot of good times partially due to kratom. But after enough time past, those effects diminished, and I was just chasing the feeling that kratom no longer gave me. Now on my 5th day clean, I feel like I'm over the worst of the physical symptoms, but I'm weary of the psychological symptoms of PAWS that I've read about on here. I'm determined to quit though. I feel like quitting kratom is a foundational step to my growth as a person, and to regaining my health. I'm just taking it one day at a time, and reminding myself that these terrible feelings will pass.

Should I try dosing extremely small before bed for sleep and taper how much i need for sleep until I don’t need anything?

A lot of the physical issues I had gotten from my 85+gpd habit have completely resolved since then. Hyperpigmentation being one of them. I have also started to transition into a meat only diet. For some reason since I’ve quit I lost the ability to handle sugar/processed foods. It will bring back alot of the issues I’ve had since quitting. I won’t go into detail about the symptoms as the list is so long and there doesn’t seem to be any clear link to any of them. But for some reason when I let my diet go it will temporarily bring back the hyperpigmentation. Even being almost a year(relatively clean) I really wish I knew why. And I guess I’m just curious if anyone else has dealt with this. I’ve made a few posts about sugar-processed foods and the connection to withdrawal. It doesn’t seem like anyone has had this experience. But most people haven’t gotten to the point of developing physical health side effects in the first place. So I’m just curious if anyone who’s has gotten the hyperpigmentation or any other health issues to begin with notice a worsening of symptoms when your diet is particularly bad. Or just being unhealthy in general ie. lack of exercise/smoking/drinking. It would be really nice to be able to make sense of this. Either way I’m gonna try to stick to this mostly carnivore diet as it has helped more than anything else throughout this quit.,5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984896183013916}"

The biggest ongoing struggle after PAWS was managing an addictive personality. That doesn’t go away after Kratom, and must be kept in check. I was dumb in that I went through phases where I replaced it with other harmful things.

But I’m happy to say I’ve made it 2 years. Looking back it doesn’t even seem that long. When you’re in the thick of it, it certainly does though.

My morning routine is starting to come back to me, I'm actually eating breakfast in the morning now rather than dosing myself immediately after waking up.

I’ve been addicted to Kratom for the last 1-2 years, and I’m currently using between 50-100gpd and extracts. I’ve quit before, but my usage was not this high, and it was agonizing. I couldn’t sleep for days, extreme anxiety/panic, etc.

I’m considering entering a 4-7 day detox program (and probably outpatient rehab afterwards) to help me get through the acute WD’s, as the only thing stopping me from quitting are the acute WD’s. I usually feel ok after a week, but that first week is brutal.

To those who have been to detox, I’m curious how your experience was, and how difficult the WD was during detox. Also, I’m very curious what medications they administered to you in detox, and the dosages. Although I haven’t used any benzodiazepines in a number of months, I have a naturally high tolerence to them and I’m honestly afraid that I will be under medicated in detox and will be freaking out as I can’t leave. I may be overthinking this, but I’d love to hear about people’s experiences in detox for Kratom and the medication regiment that they underwent.

I started taking kratom to help me focus on my business and initially it worked great, but the last year of my habit it was completely counterproductive and I can feel the damage it's done to my brain.

Luckily I can get away with about 2-3 hrs of focused work per day, but even that has been a massive struggle to get through!

But each day I can feel things getting easier. By sitting and forcing myself to get through some messages, even for 5 minutes before giving in and scrolling YouTube again, I am slowly getting through my focus problems.

During the first 6 days, there were some days where I literally could not force myself to even open Whatsapp messages without peaking my anxiety, let alone accomplish anything useful.

I also feel that meditation is getting easier and more beneficial. On kratom I stopped meditating completely because it wasn't helping much, now I notice the upsides a lot more so it's easier for me to do.

My mood regulation and lethargy is slowly lifting, still present, but getting noticeably better as each day goes on.

I'm focusing on the ""no zero days"" mentality, where even if I feel terrible one day, I will not let myself do NOTHING. I will at least force myself to get through work in 5-minute chunks or WHATEVER the heck I can muster.

# I can freaking hyperfocus again!!! What! 

**Day 32 CT**

I knew that my brainpower and such would start coming back around the 1 month mark, but wow. Last year when I started up with kratom again, I was also on Zoloft, and the combo of kratom with the SSRI really messed up my ability to focus and killed my energy levels. I thought, stupidly, it was the Zoloft, so I got off of it and went full-force into kratom dependence. Obviously, that didn't help with the focus issue, lol.

The last year has been so hard and I've been unable to find much enjoyment in anything I previously loved, let alone the energy to do the thing, lol. My memory was completely shot and it was really hard for me to recall anything quickly or easily, as well. I've always been fairly intelligent/intellectual and it was hard to deal with a brain that wasn't performing at its normal capacity. **It made me feel stupid, honestly.** 

Before I finally quit kratom last month, it got to the point where I could really only do a few activities every day before I was both exhausted and mentally blocked. I'd maybe do one productive thing and then I'd just sit in front of my computer for hours, stuck in thought loops and activity loops of opening and closing the same webpages multiple times to create a distraction I couldn't even focus on. I could barely get through a Youtube video, let alone do my writing work. It was so frustrating to be stuck in those loops and be completely unable to get out of them, even after taking more kratom.

Since I quit, I was worried I'd permanently ruined my ability to focus,. However, I have spent several hours over the last few days getting into the ""flow"" state with various activities that I haven't been able to enjoy in a long time. 

I've been writing and hooping and instead of forcing myself to do the thing, I'm actually getting into it and losing myself in activities again. **As an artist and creative, the flow state is soooooo important to me, and it's really hard to access it when your reward centers are all fucked up from kratom.** 

If you're feeling creatively blocked or unable to focus even after quitting, I promise it gets better. Last time around I was on kratom for less than a year and it took about 3 months for my brain function to return to baseline. This time I was on it for over a yr, abusing it heavily, so the timeline will probably be longer. I'm just grateful to see the rays on sunshine cutting through the clouds.

Seeing her really bolstered how worth the struggle this is, I have so many great things in my life that I'm completely unwilling to lose to addiction.

I dropped her off at home, and headed to work.

I’ve made a post half sure half skeptical on if this substance is safe for me to use anymore. 

I can 100% say without a doubt, kratom is doing damage to my body. Everytime I take even a small amount, it takes me atleast 3 days to pee normally (without pushing). It’s to the point where I cannot function normally. The urgency is so bad. And I pee fine until my next dose. 
I did take a couple weeks off from it &amp;amp; even that .5 dose put my body out of whack. 

On top of that, my stomach would be weird. I’d get nauseas even when I stayed hydrated. Woke up constipated, etc. And if I drank too much water, my whole work day would be in the bathroom stall. 
There is no way around it, Kratom can be harmful in many ways. And I wasn’t exceeding 3-4g 4 days out the week.

I’m unsure of how many grams I was at because I never measure it, but I’d estimate about 35gpd for the prior year and a half. Throughout the month of January and February I got down to a half tsp dose 4 times a day. One of the guides I found on here said a half tsp is about a gram, so my intake was about 4.5gpd. I guess my addict brain felt that was good enough, and I held steady at that amount the entire year.  

A couple months ago, I started experiencing bouts of recurring strep throat. I’ve been on 4 rounds of antibiotics since the beginning of November. By the 3rd round, I was having breakthrough symptoms and would maybe stay well for 24 hours after my last dose before I’d be sick again. The lymph nodes in my neck stay swollen. I finally got into an ENT specialist Friday morning, and was prescribed prednisone basically to see what happens. My gut told me combining it with kratom wouldn’t be a good idea, and after doing some research discovered it most likely wouldn’t be, so I decided enough is enough! I’ve been tired of drinking the sludge for a very long time, so why not use this as motivation to finally quit? 

My last dose was 12 hours ago! I’ve had minor w/d and I’m hoping that the low dose I jumped from will keep it this way. I worked a 6 hour shift today and will do so again tomorrow and I definitely noticed I was more forgetful and unfocused. I also have weird light sensitivity. I got a headache around 8pm but ibuprofen and staying hydrated helped. I’m sure I won’t get a good night’s sleep for a bit either. 

My biggest fear is that the kratom was keeping whatever infection I’m battling at bay, or that the detox will lower my immune system and I’ll develop some kind of insane illness that will kill me. I have severe health anxiety as it is.🥴

I hate waking up sweating, then shivering cold. I hate every aspect of this.
This ruined my life. I’m an addict, I got off heroin a while back and was doing good. I was sober for about a year and thought I’d try this harmless plant. Worst decision. It just sparked my addiction up, and although I was lucky and didn’t get back on H or pills I did dabble once I started kratom. I wanted the rush, kratom was a tease. 
Eventually I learned some self control and purely took kratom daily. I usually dose 3 times a day, about 12-15g each time. 
My wife and the love of my life is leaving me over this addiction. I’m going to have to fight for custody. I lost my job due to no motivation because I feel like shit constantly from kratom but if I don’t have it I feel worse. I hid my addiction from my partner for years.

I’ve found that if I get any kind of inebriated be it from smoking or drinking it seems to put me back at square one for about two weeks. But then slight anxiety lingers. I smoked a lot over Christmas and have been paying for that ever since, I just keep waiting for it to end for good.

I read in someone else’s post that after quitting opioids that quitting anything that has to do with dopamine can be more difficult for us. Maybe that brings me some comfort in that I just quit nicotine again (decade long addiction) and maybe that WD is just hitting me harder than before, because this is the only time I’ve quit opioids prior to quitting nic.

It also happens that I work evening shifts, starting at 3 and ending at 10.

I'm starting to get my routine back, slowly, I'm starting to feel connected to my body again, my energy, and appetite are slowly returning more day over day. Before Kratom I was an extremely fit individual, I cooked all of my own meals, I lifted heavy weights 4 days a week, I was a cyclist.

No supplements or helper meds help more than being in company with someone going through the same thing or someone that just wants to help. 

I know many of us hid our addiction to Kratom from everyone, I was one of these people for 3+ years. I don't think I would have made it as far as I have without coming clean to as many people as I could. Talk about how you are feeling, check in as much as possible.

After a year of about 15grams a day and many months of trying to give up, I finally pulled the trigger. 

I did a rapid taper dropping a spoonful every few days over the course of a few weeks, until I was at 2 teaspoons a day and one last teaspoon the morning of my last dose.

Now my situation is unique, I was moving countries to where it is illegal so knew I had no other option. 

But, before I left the country I was in I moved to the capital city to run errands, having taken my last dose the morning of my flight.

The key here was keeping busy.  I had a shit tonne of errands to do so my mind was preoccupied with that, despite feel like shit.

If you’re sitting at home feeling sorry for yourself, then yes, it’s going to be 1000x harder. Like it was for me every time I tried to quit.

So my challenge to you is this. Take a week off work, book a vacation somewhere, plan out an itinerary that’ll have you busy from the time you wake up until you hit the pillow.

You’ll have an amazing time, and be free when you get back. Maybe somewhere you can enjoy some exercise.

This shit really isn’t like any illicit substance, 99% of it is in your head.

Just laying around doing jack shit on the couch. Sensitive to the slightest sound. Crippling anxiety. Bouts of unprovoked rage. Dizziness. Wobbles. Nausea. Then getting to where I started to need to drink or take benzos to even handle it. It was a rough kick… and to be totally transparent… I was kicking more than just Kratom. Booze. Benzos. Cocaine. I went hard after the first lockdown back in March of 2020. The withdrawals sucked. I thought I was gonna be stuck like that forever. Those first 4-5 days were brutal. Then… the first 9 months with the whole on and off PAWS thing. I did and still do 12 step programs. I started to get more physically active. Started doing more outdoors activities like kayaking and fishing. After a while I started to feel passion for my career in music again. (Which even during COVID has rebounded in a major way) My marriage has started to heal. I know who my real friends are. It’s coming up on 2 years pretty soon and it’s rare for me to think of Kratom. I am still neurotic and moody and all the shit I have ALWAYS been… but I have learned healthy coping mechanisms that actually WORK. (Unlike Kratom and the rest)

I highly suggest the 12 step programs, or a drug therapist if you can afford it. I really probably should have went to a treatment facility but I am stubborn and poor so I just sweat it out. If I can do it, a ridiculous musician with ADHD, then so can you. Good luck.

I feel so ashamed and embarrassed because I seem to be addicted to Kratom and now I’ve found out I’m pregnant, not even 5 weeks yet so very early. This is my 5th pregnancy and I have had 2 births with a history of miscarriage. I also currently have Covid despite being vaccinated. I have a teen and a 2 year old. 

I have been taking Kratom since July 2021 and had slowly worked my way up to daily use, about 27-30 gpd with 3 doses daily. About 6 weeks ago I decided to take a break and realized the next day I was having withdrawal symptoms. I felt so stupid once I realized it was that and not Covid or flu, which is what it felt like. I broke down and told my husband who knew I was using it but not at that quantity or frequency. He is very supportive and encouraged me to taper down. So I began tapering but stalled a bit over the holidays. 
Installed at about 6-9 grams per day and this week while having Covid and after finding out I’m pregnant, I’ve cut down to one 6 gram dose in the morning and one 3 gram dose in the evening. I’m wanting to taper more because I don’t want to harm my embryo or be on Kratom any more and am terrified. Currently when I stretch out my doses my WD symptoms are NOT as bad as the first time 6 weeks ago. In fact I feel fine during the day but it’s the nighttime that’s an issue. The other day I went 23 hours between doses because I figured I was already miserable from Covid so why not? 
However I have not been getting any sleep and having severe RLS. 
I guess I’m looking for encouragement to keep tapering. Since my WD symptoms decreased in the past 6 weeks, if I continue to taper will they continue to decrease? Will they be super mild by the time I “jump off?” 

I have a demanding job as well. I’m so ashamed of this and the hormones aren’t helping. I’m a professional with a graduate degree and great career and I feel like such a horrible person and mom for letting this happen. I’m a “normal” person who loves her kids and family and job. I don’t want to tell my obgyn and have made the decision not to at this point. 
I’d like to do a faster taper at this point than what I’ve done. I had almost zero problems tapering after the first incident when I inadvertently went CT for 36 hours 6 weeks ago. Can anyone give me some hope with this? Please.",16,{'covid': 4},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9932829141616821}"

Yes, I know, I put myself in quite the predicament. Regardless, I dropped from 60 gpd to 36 (3 12g doses daily), then to 33, then now to 30 using the same dosing regimen. I tried not taking my morning dose the other day, but felt pretty significant withdrawal for most of the day. Although I will say when I got home from work I actually didn't feel too bad until I took my normal nightly dose. Still, I dont feel comfortable jumping off just yet. 

I'm thinking I'll drop by 1 gram per dose every two weeks, until I hit 5g, then I'll drop by .5, then at around 3g I'll start dropping by .3, and continue in that fashion. Should I drop by smaller and smaller amounts until I'm basically taking nothing? Or could I jump off by the time I'm at like 2g per dose? Cuz when I started, I was taking 4-6g doses. And once I was taking such doses daily, I was feeling withdrawals after around 12 hours without dosing. So I'm thinking, once I get to about half that, it should be safe and comfortable to jump off. Idk. 

People who are now fully clean after tapering, when did you jump off? Was it still uncomfortable? How bad was the withdrawal, if you had any? 

Thank you. I'm coming off close to four years of daily dosing, and at one point I was taking up to 90gpd. That's 30g per dose. It was hell on my stomach, as you can probably imagine. I'm really proud of myself for coming this far, despite my other addictions. Once I get fully clean I can finally get MAT for alcohol and finally be completely drug free! But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it I guess.

I'm ready for sleeplessness, body cramps, kicks, hot/cold sweats...I want to feel the pain! Bring it! I want to remember how bad the withdrawals were so I never go back! 
    A little back history, I started Kratom about 4 years ago after hearing about it from the JRE podcast, and since I started using, I haven't gone a day without it. I started with a couple of caps a day. It slowly escalated to taking up to 25-45 caps a day, depending on my daily tasks were. About 9ish months ago, I discovered OPMS liquid kratom (the green bottle), and WOW! That bitter-tasting black sludge grabbed me by the balls and sucked me in! I've been taking 1-2½ bottles a day since, and I've also been taking about 10-20 Dilaudid pills a month for the past year or so. 
    With that said, I just took the last of my meds and juice today, and I'm quitting cold turkey. I guess I just wanted some advice on what to expect. I used to take 60-80mg daily dose of methadone for about 4 years and was able to do a fast taper off in about 3-4 weeks, so I'm familiar with withdrawal symptoms to an extent, but this will be my first experience with Kratom and cold turkey. 
    Do you guys have any helpful advice on what to do and not to do would be greatly appreciated. Is there any way to speed up the symptoms? Some sort of body detox? Vitamins? I know nights are going to be super rough. Any OTC meds to help with sleep for the first few days?? I know I said I want to feel all the withdrawals, but I also have 3 kids and a wife I need to provide for still, so I want to bounce back the quickest way possible.

Once that got 2 expensive I settled on 2 in the morning then 3 oz of powder the rest of the day. I have 6 Bio kids, 4 adopted kids, and 2 long term foster kids.

I had been on kratom for 3 years at that time. It was surprisingly easy as I went really slow. Dropped to ~18GPD day one and over 3 months went down to 6GPD with pretty much no symptoms or discomfort beyond cravings. Didn't last long though and I've been at 24-30GPD for almost two years (oops). 

Well I decided enough is enough and moved from roughly 4x 7g doses down to 7-8x 3g doses a few days ago and added agmatine (28g down to 21-24g per day with 2g agmatine daily). I have always scaled my doses. On the second day the doses already weren't stopping WD for more than an hour and a half, and sometimes I don't even feel a dose. I also wake up like 4 times every night which is making work difficult. The beginning of this taper is a lot harder than last time for some reason but I feel like I didn't drop much at all. Maybe it's because I dropped from 7g to 3g doses?

Does anyone have any advice on how to make the taper less painful? The withdrawal symptoms aren't as bad as they could be but I thought I wouldn't have WD symptoms this early... I'm not allowing myself to cheat beyond taking an extra dose if I have to at night. But I'm never allowing myself to take more than 3g at a time ever again!",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997901439666748}"

I guess that doesn't really surprise me after what I've been through. This is mostly a warning to people who look at the dosages here and say ""Gee, I don't take that much/I don't use every day!"" If you're even looking here there is likely a reason. 

Thought I would share my story of the last 1.5 years of extract abuse. I used maybe once every 5-7 days religiously. Typically on a Friday night to ""relax"" (all it really did was give me this fake euphoric feeling where I was constantly agitated). Started noticing withdrawals when I'd hit like 8 days without and thought maybe it was just the change in seasons. Deep down I really knew what was up. Fast forward and it was a week and a half before Christmas and I'd had enough. Just was sick of the diarrhea and agitation. Was literally sick if I didn't take it, so I said to hell with this demonic sludge I'm gonna fight this. It wasn't easy, but it's already been one month. Anxiety and hear rate issues are pretty much the big lingering thing for me, but compared to a week ago, or two weeks I feel great. Even those two symptoms themselves have come and gone with less strength each time. Avoiding any stimulants is key for me. 


Like most people the physical stuff wasn't a big deal compared to the emotional and mental side. The weird manic into shameful states convinced me to talk to my doctor about clonidine. I got that and some diazepam which made things so much easier. Thankfully I've never had an issue with benzos or alcohol so I was happy to have some help in that department. But I'm not going to lie, CBD did just as much as the valium minus the sleep aid. I swear by that stuff for anxiety as long as you're not constantly taking it(I hate the idea of constantly taking anything to feel okay, it scares me). I'm not hugely religious, but I started praying. It feels like a way to acknowledge my own problems while asking for strength and protection. 

Exercise was huge too. Even just light jogs/power walking each morning helps. An evening jog is good too as long as you hydrate and relax before getting in bed. This was mainly for the restless legs. I'd been recommended Hyland's RLS PM by a loved one and started using it the same night I started my evening jogs, so it's hard to say how much help it really is. 

I get that this is the same shit everyone else here has said, but I really want to stress what this did to me as a weekly user. This shit is not a wonder drug. It is not a cure to anything. It's a narcotic substance that provides 0 benefit outside pain relief. Now ask anyone who's come to opiates via pain if that's worth it. They'll tell you it's not. I want to stress that the high is not worth it. Shit changes as you get older; In my early 20s I had no issue taking things without the urge to repeat usage. As life's stresses began to mount I looked for something besides weed and the occasional drink. Turns out I wasn't the invincible, handsome young man of yesteryear, but instead a mortal human who falls into the same pitfalls as others. For me personally the problems I had were totally manageable. Social anxiety sucks, but I have my friends and it's just something you take one day at a time. Adding addiction to the ""one day at a time"" regimen sucks! If you're browsing this place because you think you have a problem, you probably do. 


And just remember everyone has bad days. Even the healthiest people feel anxiety and sadness. We are all taking it hour by hour and day by day. I have tremendous faith in each and every one of you.

During those 50 days, I woke up crying every single day. I sobbed and I sobbed. What have I done to myself? I had no one else to blame. I was terribly depressed on a level never previously experienced.

Honestly, I CANT work right now. My head hurts too much.
I think this could be a successful quit. My taper was super long, and since my relapse a year ago, I stayed between just 2-10 grams, occasional extracts. So I don't anticipate the major withdrawal symptoms.

But these headaches could certainly send me to extract.

I have Gaba, valium, thc, CBD- I don't use any of these until the evening, since I'm trying to be awake and alert I'm relying on IBprophen mostly. I have tried DayQuil and Tylenol cold sinus in a previous quit - but it gave me horrible anxiety.

I haven't been seeing my partner while going through this, as I didn't want her to see me in that state and experience the accompanied manic behavior, definitely miss her a lot.

2022-01-13 01:25:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/s2skpk/introducing_myself/,Introducing Myself,"I'm finally ready. This will be the last time I dance with the dirt.

I would like to introduce myself to you guys. I've been lurking for a long while. I can't remember exactly how long, but I've been here watching on my main account gathering information and seeing everyone else's stories. I have finally made the decision to quit and whether I need support from you guys through this or not (I have an incredibly supportive wife, family, and friends outside of reddit, thank whatever deities are listening) I would like to tell my story to put this down into words to other human beings, solidify this promise to myself once and for all, and maybe inspire someone like you have me. Thanks for that by the way. Seeing other people not only try, but help eachother succeed has helped me know that I'm not alone and this truly can be done. 

I started taking kratom 5 years ago at the age of 23. I had severe chronic pain from a shitty car wreck when I was 18 that I refused to take any opiates for. I knew their potential for addiction (I danced with that devil in my teen years and swore I wouldn't again) but I had been clean from methamphetamine for 3 months (another story, I kicked that one's ass all on my own) but the cravings at that time were fucking insane, including making my pain worse, and I just couldn't take it anymore. I needed something bad but I refused to go back. So I turned to the internet for help and found a promise of a natural remedy that would take away my pain and my cravings, but never get me hooked. Like everyone else here, holy shit was I so very wrong. I was lied to just like you. Sucked in by false promises. 

It did save me then absolutely. It even saved a young couple I met later on from the clutches of morphine. Yet still the longer I went on with it the worse it got for me without me even realizing it and before long I had an ounce a day habit that was doing far worse for me than good. I think at my lowest point I was taking 12 grams a dose every four hours just to get the bare minimum.

The last year or so I've put a limit on myself. I knew it was only a matter of time before I had to put this stuff away for good so I never allowed myself under any circumstances to exceed 1.5 ounces a day, or 9 grams a dose, whichever was first and in that time I was to figure out what the hell was wrong with me. I have quite twice before and the longest I've gone without a relapse is 3 months so I've been through the hell already and came right back.

I figured out why. It wasn't the pain anymore, and maybe I'll discuss my journey of self discovery, what I revealed about myself, what I've done to fix it, and all that later on. Right now it's irrelevant and I honestly can't tell you guys up front for reasons and we can leave it at that. I'm here to quit just like you and that's what I want to focus on. Long story short, I know for a fact that I don't need it for physical reasons anymore. I found a way to truly heal my body. I don't need it for psychological reasons. I found a way to truly heal my mind. I don't need it for spiritual reasons. I found a path to walk. 

Honestly, now that I know myself and my potential, I never needed it at all.

The information on this sub and my previous attempts at ditching the dirt have given me the knowledge and experience necessary to get a solid plan together and put it into action. For the last four weeks I have been steadily tapering down to about 1/3 of what I have been taking in the last year in an attempt to reduce the severity of my withdrawals. This was a stunning success and I have been doing so much better than I thought I would. I have cut down to the dose I started at 5 years ago and I never thought I could do that without giving in and having to just throw it out and go cold turkey. Yet here I am.

I estimate that I have about a day and a half supply left. I was going for six weeks but after the first couple days of this week, first: The physical withdrawals are starting to kick in and I don't think I'll be able to keep tapering down without being frustrated and unhappy. From what I've read here dragging it out is just torturing yourself and I opted for a hybrid method to begin with so that I could jump whenever I felt ready, and second, well, I feel like I'm ready. I'm just done with it. Now that I can see, feel, and taste the light on the other side I feel like waiting any longer is just pointless. I can do this. I WILL do this. 

It's time to say goodbye to what I was before and become what I know I'm supposed to be. In two days time I'll be making the jump. I have everything I'll need and then some. I have love, I have life now, I have a diary to write in to keep my eyes forward and how far I've gone, most importantly I have a purpose to strive for, I know that now, and it doesn't have anything to do with this demon.

I'll see you all on the other side.

Thank you for being here.

I'll be back to see you all again soon.

My body muscles were so absolutely sore & I had no energy compared to the very beginning.. which was odd to me. My anxiety & depression was peeking the most it ever had since day 1 when I quit. I took my ibuprofen, vitamin C, & oscillococcinum , & by the time I did that& drank about 5 cups of water, around 7pm I was feeling actually pretty “normal”. I only ever just want to share my journey because we are all different & our body’s really do handle WD differently. I was terrified for the 3rd day because I got on here & saw everyone saying day 3 was the worse. It scared me. & it wasn’t even that bad for me. Bottom line, we may start to feel awful at the beginning of our day because we are still getting use to waking up & not taking anything anymore, but instead of getting high & taking something that serves us no purpose at all to our lives or bodies, now it’s about putting good things into it . Like water & vitamins! Oh& did I say water?? Being 4days CT in, I’d say right in this moment that it’s a great day to be alive & SOBER! I hope this post gives some of you fresh beginners some kind of hope that we do feel some great moments even in the beginning of WD.

The way I look at it is I did this to myself so I have to man up and deal with the consequences “rolling with the punches” the good thing is my intrusive thoughts are not getting the best of me anymore I’m feeling a sense of control over my anger which is nothing to be around. The next thing is I’m slowly getting back into working out light stretches, push ups, core work, some box jumps and brisk walks. Baby steps right? Today I actually went to a job interview and felt great about it had to walk 1.5 miles but looked at it as a workout no biggie. One thing I am learning about myself is how to harness all this pain and anger and it’s giving me motivation in itself. For example, on kratom when a thought of someone wronging me came across I would feel this instant burst of uncontrollable anger, like “fuck this person” “fuck this world” “fuck everyone” now being ten days off I feel the anger but it’s not towards anyone it’s towards thoughts of being where I want to be in life, somewhat towards myself for not being where I want to be. (Accountability) it became from “me vs. the world” back to “me vs me”. You have to have that non giving in attitude and get out there and do what needs to be done by all means necessary (of course in your pace) or be in a mental prison forever! I’m done! I’m so fucking done with this shit! And when I feel my mind creeping back, NOPE! I tell myself remember the pain! The loneliness, the cry’s, the anger, the worthlessness, the betrayal, the loss of control, and more importantly forgive yourself but never forget the pain!",21,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9820661544799805}"

I honestly did not think I would be posting in here again, but k snuck its claws in again. I went almost 6 months without it after seeking professional help for kratom amongst other substances (Partial Hospitalization and Intensive Outpatient). There were obviously cravings, but I told myself that never again, ""you worked too hard to get here"" and ""what will it solve?"".

I had a handful of slip-ups with other substances these past six months (tianeptine and phenibut), but was able to stop, flush and move forward, but I never allowed my brain to process, accept and adjust to sober life. Kratom was where I drew the hard line in the sand, but an intense craving came so unexpectedly, I felt that I had no choice, but to act on it. For me, kratom always gave me that warm blanket, ""everything is okay"", ""I have nothing to be really anxious about"" feeling- It's what became dangerous, as in the past, I would begin to drift and numb with kratom.

Funny enough, I had COVID, felt miserable, wanted relief, couldn't exercise to get relief and the kratom thought popped into my head innocently at first and then it would simply not go away. I was out riding my bike and rode 20 minutes home having an angel vs. devil debate the whole time. I finally said ""I will only settle this by trying it!"" and went into smoke shop, bought a shot, ripped it open and took half without even thinking. In my eyes, I got closure at the moment, but I allowed myself to let a boundary erode and a familiar pattern to take hold again.

I justified it with ""It's just one shot"", ""You tried it; now you know."" Just how kratom finds a way to always creep back in, I began to use it instead of drinking or if I was really stressed. Pretty soon I realized that I had ""tried it one more time"" 4 out 6 days. The accessibility was a kicker and anytime I got stressed, I would impulse buy a shot. I had worked hard the past six or so months to get and stay sober, but it was mentally very taxing and a day to day struggle. I found that kratom turned down the volume and allowed me a brief rest from racing thoughts, cravings and anxieties.

I basically used 9/13 days in sporadic doses leading up to Christmas and was able to refrain for three days home being around family and loved ones. However the second I returned back to work, the seed had been planted and now I was taking a shot or a scoop to enhance or tolerate day to day activities. I kept telling myself ""you've quit so many times before. You're not in as deep this time. This is temporary"", but still I used now everyday and before I just quit, I had used 9/9 days.

I let my boundaries grow weak and turned to k, when I thought it was the best available answer. It allowed me to numb, escape and rationalize: I will not lie it felt great at times, but there is always a cost. My grandmother's recent passing snapped me out of it. I realized that I needed to emotionally be all there for my Nana, my mom, in the rest of my family. I knew if I continued to slip deeper into k use, I would regret not truly being there for the passing of such an amazing woman who gave me life.

I was able to quit and the kindling effect is real! It's been 8 days of increased anxiety, night sweats and restless leg. I realized that I was taking shortcuts with my recovery and not allowing myself to truly heal from six months ago. I'm not saying kratom is evil (or any substance for that matter); what can be evil is depriving yourself and your loved ones of your true emotions, hardships, joys, and support. For me, kratom brought out what I thought was a better version of myself (more sociable, more relaxed, funnier), but there is always a price to pay and if I could moderate use, I wouldn't be in this position.

For me right now, a really helpful tactic is to play out what would happen if I used. I would get a shot (spend $20), I would feel good for 4 hours tops and then it would go away. What then? I would know that in order to feel that way again I would need another shot and eventually 2 shots and thus begins the cycle that got to where I needed professional help 6 months ago.

I'm 6 days in. I'm an alcoholic and an addict for sure. Quit drinking 6 years ago but never got ""sober."" I just stopped drinking and searched for anything else I could get my hands on. Once I found kratom it was only a matter of time (weeks in fact) before I was doing it all day every day. It's such a f&ck'd up substance, at least for an addict because it instantly makes you feel good and more can make you feel better. But when you come off it you are down, depressed, anxious and the only thing that makes you feel better in the short term is more kratom. I can honestly say this is by far the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.

The silver lining - I'm convinced this experience is finally going to make me sober...gotta be positive.

The one thing that I wanted to say, and hopefully this is good advise that someone else can use to STAY off this sh!t, **don't try and do this alone**, don't try and lock yourself in the basement and suffer through the withdrawals in isolation, you need to surround yourself with friends, you need to force yourself to talk about it.

Every time I've tried to do this before - it was by myself and clearly didn't work. I never spoke about it with anyone and hid everything I was feeling and thinking. That only lead me to resent stopping using it and it was only a matter of time before I found myself back on it. Kratom wants you alone and isolated so your only option is to keep using it.

This past week, on day four, I was home by myself and was literally going crazy. Constant panic attack, tired from insomnia, agitated, chills, everything. The next day (yesterday) my wife got me out of the house. We went to an AA meeting, saw my parents, and had me call a friend to talk about what I was going through. To me, this was a miracle. That good feeling that we were chasing with kratom came back, but it was natural. All the panic and anxiety died down to nothing...mostly.

I'm far from through this, still feel pretty rough, but the difference is this time I'm going to use my relationships, talk to friends, be open about it. Even writing this make me feel better. This morning I woke up on the couch, tired from being awake since 3am and did not want to get up. The anxiety started to creep in at the thought of doing anything. But I was able to make it to a meeting, spoke to some people and instantly felt much - felt like I could finally manage. For some reason, the things we need to do that will make us feel better are so hard to start. That's why having someone force you to make a move and stay accountable is key in these first 2 weeks.

After 2 sleepless nights in a space that wasn't my own, we both agreed I would be better off returning to my own environment to finish out.

However, as soon as I finished the 2 hour drive back home I felt a million times better and much, much more confident in my ability to stick to embracing the suck this time.

I managed 9 hours of sleep last night, which was mostly due to the fact that I had been up for 2 days, but sleep is sleep, so I'm thankful. 

The main reason for my relapse over a year ago was due to me not fully accepting that I can never touch K again, and having a brief moment of confidence that I could ""just take a small dose to reward myself for 5 months clean"" and now I'm here. I've become aware and acquainted with that little voice in my head, and have come to know that that voice isn't me, it's my addiction.

Anyways fucking PAWs!  Always wondered what it was like n pretty sure I now know.  Ugh.  Yesterday was first day I really started craving kratom as had first day of a pottery class I’d been wanting to take forever.  Well the reality of now it’s today plus insomnia issues had me seriously doubting going then think kratom was the answer but ended up going, resisting urge to flee when it proved far more difficult than imagined, and made it thru day without kratom.

But today craving still n definitely feeling dreaded PAWs.  Keep going to sleep fine but then waking super early unable to sleep.  Not restless limbs at least but just totally awake.  Thinking to just embrace it and become a 5am gym type instead of my old 2pm.

Haven’t been to gym since New Years.  Went a bit during first week CT but was using klonopin to resist kratom so that first week was a blurry mess of questionable decisions.  But made it thru n still no kratom.

Been using gabapentin but keep forgetting to take it n think I should let it go now too.  

But PAWs even wide awake no real urge to move n feels like everything requires great Will to accomplish.  It’s like being stoned and on kratom but minus the high part kinda.  Just numb n dull.

At first music n emotions were so magical yet now nothing really seems to cause emotion or reaction.  Suppose it’s peaceful.

Anyway just posting for encouragement as the urge to get kratom seems significant today and that idiot voice that tells me ‘well the past 2 weeks were easy (they weren’t, was an effort that took literally 4 years to get) so why not reward yourself n enjoy the day’

I was using responsibly for the first 2 years then as life got more crazy, it was how I would numb myself to get through it. It wasn't until I started getting digestive issues this year, did I think I had a problem. 

I just wanted to share a few things that I did that might help someone. Naturally I figured I could go cold turkey, but did not have the time or if I'm being honest, the willpower to get through it. So I planned a very long and methodical tapper. 

At my highest I was probably hitting 3 tbsp of the green stuff a day, but for the last year I was around 1 to 2. Tappering down to 1tbsp was pretty easy. But I've been working on that last 1, since October. 

I was patient with it and have always been pretty good at sticking to just 3 doses so I would cut 1/4 of a tsp out of the middle dose first, wait a week sometimes two if it felt right. Then the third dose, then the first. 

Eventually I got to the point where the 2nd dose was gone and as enough time passed, I was down to 1 tsp. (Just two doses!) 

This is where it got tricky because when I started reducing from there the withdrawls were not fun. 

So about 3 weeks ago my stomach was really hurting and I was reading how Vitamin C can help with tappering. So my logic was well why don't I just do a vitamin C flush? Mind you this isn't exactly a fun thing to do, but you feel great after. Much to my surprise though the next day I only took 1/2 of a teaspoon, and felt fine! 

So I kept that going for 2 weeks, did another flush last sunday and have not touched it since. 

Here is the thing... I feel pretty good all things considering. Yesterday I had a bit of a headache, but it was more annoying than debilitating. But today is pretty okay! But the big thing is, my stomach issues (mainly really bad acid reflux... seem to be improving rapidly). 

Anyway if you are stuck on a tapper dose, I think it is worth a shot to read up on the flush. Good luck! And good health!",8,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6945529580116272}"

Now my battle plan is: Go there and and be 14 days clean already - that way I get the most out of it - we would be able to focus on managing my addiction in long term, instead of getting over acute  withdrawals first.

So I commit to start now! Wish me luck guys. Was at 12g a day. I can not do taper (I have tried). So I am dropping it now! Just put bleach into my Kratom bags and throw them into the trash (that way I wont be tempted to take them out and take more Kratom). I will keep exercising 5x a week, I have bought a meal service (they deliver me meals for the day 3x times a week). And I wil be posting into a daily tread.  


So my promise is: 

* Exercise according to my workout plan (5x a week and go for a quick run other days) - this is something I already do...
* Eating every day my meals (from 10 am to 18 am). I am gonna fast the rest hours

I started Suboxone treatment for my 10 year Kratom addiction after at least 30 relapses and use sometimes averaging 50-100gpd. I was on Suboxone for about 3 months, up to 12mg/day, then moved to the sublocade injection which was the ultimate lifesaver here (for me).

Anyhow, I completed treatment, this is my second month off Suboxone and I can't believe I'm here. I don't have any urges to use, I have a job in my field of interest, a new family member on the way (so exciting), better grades in school, and renewed appreciation for feeling things sober.

Not only have I curbed kratom (still day by day, but often I don't even have to think about that anymore), but I haven't touched any RC's, stimulants, benzos, and I stopped drinking.

This forum helped me make many changes, and saw many of my relapses. I just have to say, while there was some negativity here surrounding my choice, I am not sure I would have been able to accomplish what I have without the resources I sought out. Always I used to think I could take care of this beast myself, but I needed therapy and I needed a new approach. I also needed to accept this as a part of myself and not try to surpress it, and lie about it to my family and loved ones.

God willing this is the last time. On Christmas eve morning I woke up and said no more. Threw everything in the toilet and flushed it.

When you’re accustomed to suffering, the act of suffering's no less painful, but you know what to expect and it becomes normal. This time was no different. The sweating and stinking (yes stinking), the anxiety, the irritability, the bloating, the headaches, the body aches, the nausea, the diarrhea…all old hat over here. Thank God almighty the worst of it seems to be over. After steady progress for a couple weeks, the last 2 days were hell. Unbelievable headaches and body aches and brain fog. I caught myself more than a couple times staring into my monitors at work with my mouth agape, practically drooling. I just couldn’t brain. The brain wasn’t working. Then I woke up this morning, and despite some threats of misery, the headaches never really came, not fully. Maybe like 10%. I’ve been super productive at work, I can think; it’s the first day in a long, long time I’ve felt like a person.

I’m so happy to have even a tiny taste of normalcy I’ve shed some silent tears. Grown man crying. But it’s good. If today was good, maybe tomorrow will be too. At least I know that after all this misery it’s possible to be normal again. In time the good days will outnumber the bad, then eventually I will have recovered.

So if you’re suffering in acutes, don’t worry – It gets better. It takes time. It’s not linear. You’ll have spells of misery out of nowhere for seemingly no reason, but hold the line. This is the proverbial battle of good vs evil. We choose agency, we choose free will, or we jump in a demon’s backpack and go on doing his will. I have some experience with recovery from other compounds, and I don’t mean to turn this into a 12 step diatribe, but we 3rd step in reverse when we use. I turn my will and my life over to the care of Kratom, and I’m shocked when it laughs and slowly leads me to hell. And I do this again and again. Insanity.

Today has been my most emotional day so far. I’m either on the verge of happy tears or pissed off, no in between. My kids were watching an animated film and I swear any cute little scene made me tear up. Later on I got super upset because I fucked up dinner, and that’s not something that would normally cause an extreme reaction out of me. I’m fighting the urge to nap with really strong coffee, and fighting the cravings by reminding myself that the kratom is why I feel this way and that it’s never going to get better if I don’t stop.

A couple new things I’ve tried this time around: 

No more attempts at tapering. Cold turkey this time. 
My failures in the past were due to the lack of sleep at night. Anxiety hits me hard at bedtime during withdrawals, and it gets to the point where I need to take kratom because I simply cannot function normally throughout the day. I’ve taken a few of the supplements that are recommended by the sub and they do help! They don’t completely kill the anxiety and RLS, but it’s enough to help me sleep! Highly recommend!

Cannabis is also suggested regularly, which I personally don’t enjoy at all (more anxiety), but I did try delta 8 THC, and that definitely helps in small doses throughout the day. It kinda levels out my mood and while it does make me feel lazy, I’m not sleepy all day. I’ll take that over wanting to nap all day and then having insomnia when it’s actually okay for me to sleep.

Taper is holding steady,  but there were some BIG non kratom challenges over the last 2 weeks, and I had to pause for 2 weeks at 6g/ day:

1) I got really sick (not from the taper, just a virus)
2) we had a terrible snowstorm where I live and lost power and internet for 12 days (hence my radio silence).

In consultation with my therapist I didn't keep dropping my taper amount (but didn't increase) so as not to put my body through increased stress while sick and dealing with trying to survive 12 days in the cold and dark with little communication. 

I kept it up,  though,  and didn't go back! Now that we're free and clear of the worst of it, I've resumed my taper and I'm excited to be mere weeks away from done!

I’ve been sober from alcohol for two years now and my only takeaway is the inner feeling that Im such an addict that I did it to myself again without realizing it.

My battle now is with extreme lethargy and lack of motivation, which has always been my reason for relapse.

The longest I've made it before was about 21 days, and I've made it past 1 week 3 times, but every time is the same story. I have an extremely hard time getting myself to work due to anxiety over even things as simple as answering my emails, so I procrastinate HEAVILY.

Literally some days I will not even answer a single message from my team or anyone. I own an online agency with 20+ employees, and even 1 day of doing this stacks the workload up heavily, then after multiple days it becomes a massive task to catch up, which of course causes more anxiety.

It's such a battle every day to get anything done at all, but I am pushing myself to do something, even if it's constantly interrupted by giving in to my procrastination on YouTube or video games.

Acutes for me are a cakewalk compared to the long, drawn-out lethargy of PAWS that I expect will last for at least 2 months. Question is, can I force myself to work just enough to not cause massive problems in my business?

I am doing my very best to meditate and go to the gym every day, but some days it's so hard to even get off the couch at all, let alone do all the things I know I should do for self care.

But screw it, I'm in this quit for the long haul, and even if it destroys my business I honestly will take that over continuing to be a slave to the green poison for a 4th year in a row. I just turned 30 and I can feel the destruction kratom has had on my body and mind.

Missed all of last week as first week I got off kratom in a dangerous way by borrowing 30 klonopin from a good friend.  She also suggested I microdose psilocybin every few days too.  First week was fun but messy as looking back was definitely mildly insane on the klonopin.  Had gabapentin too so used it to get off the klonopin rather successfully BUT definitely more crazy and had to basically explain to a good friend why I was so off as I’d hired a web designer for my massage business he’d suggested n was close to n just knew I was being a bit psycho so was met with support and definitely feeling less psycho and less drawn to the gabapentin as it can get addictive n have an unpleasant withdrawal but really is pretty great at mitigating kratom withdrawal.

Figure I essentially detoxed myself but definitely see how I might have triggered a full on alcohol then hard drug bender but thank all the gods I seem to have finally almost gotten off this filth.

It feels like a fungal or bacterial overgrowth that i was feeding throughout my years of abuse. This has happened to me on kratom alot but i found ways to manage symptoms and mitigate. After quitting nothing seemed to let up.

I also felt a huge mental withdrawl 13 days in. so sluggish, can't move much. brain fog. and i have to move to another by myself in a week! i don't have alot of things so its not that terrible but it has still been daunting as i go through this.

Well i recently started a very controversial protocol of taking mms to clean out my gut and i cannot tell you how astoundingly wonderful i feel. like actually feeling like myself in my body.

TL;DR I've decided to quit and already dreading the next few days. Please give me some words of encouragement and or share your quitting story.


So, I've been using Kratom fairly consistently for about a year and a half. It has caused a few issues for me that have built up and caused me to want to stop. I really don't have the money to keep using it, and at times I've found myself buying it when I really can't afford it. The good feelings that I get from it aren't worth the financial strain it causes.
I have a history of drug abuse, I was addicted to Robitussin so much in the past that I became homeless and went to prison from my use and lifestyle.
    Nowadays I have my life together, I live in a nice house, meditate nightly, have a good vehicle and job so forth, but I'm finding my cravings for Kratom are so strong lately when I don't have it. There have been a couple weeks in the last few months where I didn't have Kratom for a few days, and I felt like I couldn't enjoy anything! I would wake up angry that I have to go to work. At work the clock would tick by SO slow! When I get home I would just try to go to sleep as soon as possible so that I could make it to pay day and buy more Kratom.
 It's so shitty, it feels like all my motivation and happiness or anything comes from a stupid powder. Even worse is that it doesn't fuck my life up like alcohol or Robitussin so it's so difficult to find motivation to quit, it's like nicotine in that sense.
 But I'm really sick of the weekly pattern. Buy some Friday, run out by Wednesday and then have two days that absolutely suck until pay day comes and I start all over again.
I was 100% Sober for about 2 years recently, and I just remember everything was so much more relaxed. I went to work, did what I needed to, got home and played video games or watch shows, and go out on the weekends. But nowadays it seems like I need Heaton 3 to do these things that were normal to be before.
 If you have gone through what I have, please help with some encouragement or your own personal story. Right now, quitting seems like a really difficult task. How long will it be until I start enjoying things again off of Kratom?",8,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984409213066101}"

Back to work today, sitting here miserable AF. Was hoping having something to do would help pass the time, but this really sucks. 

Having to take it 1 hour at a time at this point. I do have to say that it’s almost like a fog is slowly being lifted off my brain. I’m regaining clarity, however, my thoughts are just racing and racing and so intrusive. 

I’m wearing multiple layers to help soak up all the sweating. Still cold though, I’m sure my coworkers think I look batshit crazy right now 😅. No appetite. Having to force myself to eat little bits.

The alcohol last night was an absolutely horrible idea. It gave me no relief and just made me feel worse. Haven’t really had much diarrhea until today, but I honestly think the alcohol has a lot to do with that.

Although I'm fortunate enough just a couple days away from my 6 month mark that I rarely think of Kratom anymore, this morning I started to think that maybe I could just go ahead and see what a single small dose would be like again. Not proud of myself for having that thought this morning but I have to acknowledge that I was strongly considering it. What I noticed the last time I quit CT is that around 4-6 months in where everything is normalizing is that it's harder to recall just how much crap I put my body through those first couple weeks of CT. Just reading some of your posts helps me re-frame and live in those moments again as a valuable reminder that even just one small dose isn't worth what consequences will inevitably with come when 1 becomes 2 and I'm back trying to figure out how I got back to feeling like complete garbage on a daily basis.

after 3 years of using and approx. one year of using daily in kinda high amounts (30-60GPD) I finally kicked the sludge. I tried to kick it 2 times prior with little to no withdrawal symptoms but quickly hopped on it again since my brain told me: ""Yo, quitting was not that bad so you are not really addicted. Just go slow this time. Max 2 times a week"". I guess my love for fairy tails is still strong in me...  Yeah it used daily again 3 days after that lol.

After this relapse I used alot again peaking at 60-80 grams for a very short while (maybe 2 weeks) and also felt lost, depressed and motivationless again. At some point I realized how much this bullcrap plantpowder cost me. No libido whatsoever, brainfog, no motivation, heigthended depression and anxiety. I was just sitting around taking kratom for 5 minutes of slight euphoria and then hours of feeling like shit and berating myself for using, rince and repeat, only watching stupid Youtube-videos wasting my f\*\*\*\*\*\* life away. I was not motivated to do ANYTHING but sitting around and wasting my time. No training, no meditation, no DJ-ing, no music, no gaming, no reading. Essentially all my hobbies were dead. And man this sucks so much to see your old self falling appaert from a incredible numb and apathetic Point of view. I once was a person embracing change, doing new stuff, working on myself, progressing to beat my depression and BOOM kratom entered the chat and set me back in so many ways.

I changed so much in those 3 years. It is crazy. And only for the worst...

I dont't need to tell you guys how great it is in the beginning. It was a wonder weapon against depression and anxiety but as soon as I started to use higher and higher amounts to get high it morphed from a crutch into a hurdle. It started to controll my life. Most days I would only eat one meal so the food would not lessen the kratom high. And the crazy thing about this is I DID NOT realize I was addicted to this shit. When I think back I am just baffeled about my stupidity and the power of my brain to rationlize my behaviour. Opioids ARE sneaky. I know this for a fact now.

With peak consumption also my depression and anxiety peaked. I have problems with those things anyway but I am pretty sure kratom made it way way worse. Never in my past I had to be six week on sick leave because I cant handle everyday life...

After giving myself alot of time to think about all that slowly but surely I relized all that I wrote above and I decided to quit for good this time. So I started a slow taper.  I started with something like 2 doses a day with a max of 15 grams per dose and slowly lowered my dose every week until I willpower did not allow me to go lower. This was somwhere around 7 grams two times a day. At this point I completely switched to Stem&Vein and this was kind of an miracle for me. S&V didnt give me any high but I also had no withdrawal symptoms at all. So I took two doses of S&V a day starting with 14 grams per dose (normal leave powder is approx. double in potency of S&V) and slowly started to go down. With a few slip ups of using to much (but not getting high anyways) I met my wall at 7 Grams (which would be 3,5 Grams leafpowder). So I just emptied the 250 gram bag and kicked it. The taper was pretty painless by the way!

So I quit CT from quite a low dose 12 days ago. First to days I didn't feel to bad. I was proud of myself and nothing really happened but sneezing and cold&hot flashes. On day 3 I started to experience severe insomnia. For 5 days I could not sleep whatsoever. Since I am an insomniac I have a perscription for Argomelatin but it didn't to shit. I also think I experienced some kind of restless leg (or more like restless body) syndrome which made me to switch positions every 30 seconds. I challenged myself to not move at all until I counted to hundered. I only made it under great stress and pain. I felt pins and needles in my whole body and felt an urge to just kick full force. In those 5 days I also felt like a literal zombie. I had intense brainfog and felt the most depressed I ever felt in my life (And this means something lol. I have been very low in my past). I couldn't do anything but sitting around and wallow in self-pity lol. I am also on antidepressants \[Wellbutrin 150mg, so I don't want to imagine how I would have felt if I wouldn't be on the medication. My anxiety peaked as well. I had crazy moodswings from depressed to agressive and irritable and back. Paired with my inability to sleep it was really no bueno for me but hey... I am actually happy this happened to me. Only now I can really see clearly what the green sludge does to you. I dont wont to do that again. I don't want to be that person again.

On day 8 all of those symptoms started improving. I could sleep again with the help of a double dose argomelatin and sometimes 25mg of quetiapin when noting helped (also the restless leg bullshit stopped <3). I am so happy I had those meds at hand since they really helped me to feel more fit in the mornings ready to do stuff. If you have the possibility try to speak to your doctor and ask for a sleep aid for those days if you are an insomniac like me. Since I am in Europe the meds are very cheap. As far as I know Argomelatin is veeeery expensive in the US. Also please be carefull with phenibut. I used it a few days in a row for sleep but it didnt do much (I was kinda addicted to that too in the past...). I just gave me a crazy anxiety rebound. I would advice not using it or just use it 1 time a week max.

On day 8 all my physical symptoms like szneezing and cold-hot flashes, as well as the shivering stopped for good.

If you are like me every otc stuff does not work.  Diphenhydramin  for example just gave me horrible nightmares and sleep paralyse combined with twitches. Also weak antihistamin stuff like promethazin (witch is not otc in my country) did nothing but made my nights a living nightmare for the reasons stated above lol.

Starting from day 8 my depression got way better and my anxiety dropped from 9/10 to 3/10. I still got those mood swings but they are not severe anymore. Sometimes I just switch from happily talking with friends to sad, not wanting to talk anymore, which got me some strange looks lol. After I explained it to my closest friends those looks stopped and I only got support <3. Speaking about it feels liberating for me. I was hiding my addiction for so long. Showing this to my friends somehow made me feel so much better. No lying anymore.

Right now on day 12 my depression is still getting better und my anxiety is not always present which is great! My sleep is getting better and better. On days when I don't get tired in the evening I take a microdose of my amanita muscaria tea which seems to really support my sleep quality. If you want to know more about that send me a pm. 

Besides my mental and physical recovery my life is changing a lot lately. I am reading again, I am training again, I am listening to music again (for hours lol), I am djing again, I am meditating again. I also bought materials to draw mandalas again in the evenings. I also started to cultivate king oyster mushrooms and started fermenting white cabbage and red cabbage. Sauerkraut incoming (Yes I am german lol). 

Why am I telling you all this crap? Because I want to show you that YOU GET YOUR LIFE BACK, after kicking the sludge! In the last 4 days I spent maybe 1-2 hours on my PC or smartphone wasting time. The rest of the day I was busy doing things that have to be done or things I want to do since they are fun! Also I am so so so happy that my libido is coming back slowly... I thought I lost it forever. I am so amazed that I lost all these things, which make my life beautiful, over those 3 years. I wont get those years back but I learned a lot. NO substance, no matter how it feels in the beginning, will improve your life in the long run, if you abuse it! I know this is logical but for some damn reason I always have to experience it to understand those things. Those realizations always have to come from within for me to accept it.

Right now I would say im 80% back to myself and I hope the rest will come back in the coming month. There is still lingering anxiety and depression. I don't know if those are PAWS (I never got this far haha) and how long they will stay. I also developed a tinnitus and an atopic eczema, but you what? I don't give a shit. If I have to trade a slight tinnitus for my real self and better life I am happy to do that!

**Dear community, I wish you all the best and a lot of strength on your recovery journey**. Reading your sotries helped me a lot regarding my decision to stop! And since an week minded dude like me can make it you can make it, too lol. Give yourself the time you need, dont hate yourself for relapsing. **Just take one step at a time and you can break free and reclaim your life!**

Much love and good luck to you all!

PS:

Those are the supplements I used for withdrawal:

**Lipsomal Vitamin C**: I mega doesd Vitamin C everytime a felt the physical withdrawal and it really helped me alot in that regard. I didnt take it every 3 hours like some people say (which has it benefits I of course!) but just take it when needed. It nearly stop all the sneezing and freezing which is amazing. Only tip: Don't take it in the evening since it makes trying to sleep even worse for me. Also tried the calciumascrobat version of Vitamin C but it didnt provide as much relief as the liposomal Version.

**Black Seed Oil**: I took it 2 times a day in conjunction with the vitamin C. Black Seed Oil eased the cravings by a lot and also seemed to lower the physical sympthoms of the withdrawal.

**L-Theanine**: This is the only supplement which really does something against my anxiety. In regards of the withdrawal and anxiety spiked it lessened my anxiety just a bit. I took the edge of. But it is no wonder cure. It maybe dropped my anxiety from a 9 to an 8, but I guess every little bit helps!

**Ibuprofen**: Not an supplement but it helped the few times I hat some discomfort in my joints.

**Amanita muscaria tea**: I used this mushroom to make microdose tea from it. As soon as the hardcore insomnia subsided I strated testing the tea and it does help me. It makes me more tired, let me fall asleep faster and lets me sleep trogh the night.

**Magnesium**: I used magnesium for the restless leg stuff and it helped a little bit if at all. Other people seem to have more luck on that.

Next week I will start do supplement lions mane and reishi to boost my immune system to counter my eczema and maybe help my brain recover a bit faster.

currently on day 3 (monday) of the cold turkey stopping with kratom from 30 gpd. I listened to your recommendations guys and I got some vitamin C and magnesium. I took some yesterday evening and not really sure if it helped, but what helped me sleep for more than 4 hours was a bit of weed. If I hadn't had that, I probably wouldn't be able to sleep at all. Woke up very early, around 5:30 AM and smoked one more bowl to get me to rest and sleep for at least 1.5 more hours. It's 10:15 AM right now and already took some magnesium and vitamin C, as well as ibuprofen. That's mainly because today my physical symptoms got a bit worse in a way where every part of my body hurts, my muscles hurt and basically everything, so I decided to take some ibuprofen. I'm still quite restless, so hopefully I'll beat that a bit with magnesium. Regarding my mentals state, I feel like I have no emotions at all except a quite strong anxiety feelings which come in waves sort of. No will to do anything, just super low and kinda sick.

I have struggled with it for 5 years now. Been at 30gpd for the last year. 
My question is timing my quit- would it be best to try to get time off work now if possible, or do you all think paternity leave might be a good time to do it? Anyone have experience with this kind of scenario? 
The benefit I see with doing it on paternity leave will be that I will already be completely sleep deprived, so the insomnia would basically be a non-issue. Also, caring for our new baby might be a really good distraction and motivation I’ve been looking for. But the downside is that I would rather not taint this special time around the birth of my first child by withdrawaling the whole time. And it will require a ton of energy, and withdrawal totally drains me..

I made it over a week, and I told myself that if I make it a week I would flush my stash. I held onto it for the week because I knew if I gave in it wouldn’t matter if I flushed it I would just go to the store and buy more anyway. Anyway, today I flushed everything I had. I was buying a brand that came in a plastic tub, about the size of a large jar of peanut butter, and I save the containers for starting plants in the spring. It wasn’t hard to flush it at all , felt powerful. About an hour later, I washed the containers out with hot water and was immediately hit with the smell of kratom. That gave me a sinking feeling in my heart and I had the desire to just chug the liquid in the containers for one last high. I didn’t but it was a temptation for sure.

Thoughts welcome,"Hello lovely community - Day 7 CT from 45ish gpd, almost 5 year user. I was fortunate to get by with relatively mild physical symptoms this time which have mostly subsided (had helper meds) however now the exhaustion and anhedonia have set in and I have to work tomorrow again after a week off. I have used naltrexone in the past but usually started a super low dosage around days 3-4 (very carefully researched and planned, knowing the risks) by diluting a 50mg tablet. I now have a proper 2mg LDN rx (low dose naltrexone) from a doctor and would prefer to avoid pwd's this time around in any way as I have to start working tomorrow.  Any experiences with lower dosages at this point? Would I be safe with 1 or 2 mg tonight? I have found these lower dosages help melt away the symptoms and cravings without the anhedonia of a full 25 or 50mg dose. I am afraid if I take any amount even if I don't get any pwd I will still get insomnia, and I have been lucky enough to sleep well so far except for one night.

Obligatory Disclaimer: Please do NOT mess with Naltrexone without working with a doctor, or extensive research, if at all - it can send you into nightmare withdrawal and even to the hospital if taken too soon.

Update: For anyone who happens across this, I did take a super small dose of about .25mg in the evening, and with the help of some gabapentin was actually able to sleep although I woke up a lot. This morning I just took .5mg, so far I am feeling the best I have so far. Brain fog is starting to clear so I do have hope that it's helping.

I tapered all the way down to 1g before I jumped with the K. So physically…not horribly bad, I went through most of the withdrawal DURING the taper, believe it or not. But I came down from 50+gpd. 
Mentally I’m dying. 🥲
still getting quite a bit of anxiety (amplified because of the no weed I think) and the cold chill/sweats are still there. Occasional skin crawling/RLS but that has reduced a lot.
I’m just like, dude, when is my body temperature regulation going to return to normal😩 
Not having THC is REALLY tough right now tho because it was getting me through the K withdrawal, but I’ve GOT to get my pee clean for an upcoming dream job opportunity. So I’m embracing the suck as best I can.🥲
I just caved and bought a bit of vodka to take the edge off. I feel guilty, but I’m dying over here man. I got 4 of those little airplane bottles lol. So, 4 shots that I’ll try to space out.  Cuz I don’t want to replace one thing for another, I’m an addict, through and through.🥺😔😢
 The mental obsession, non stop craving, and overall unrest is pretty friggin tough right now.

I kicked heroin 11 yrs ago and everything else, I can do it again right? 
But I have to say guys, from what I remember, these K withdrawals are pretty👏 darn 👏 close 👏 to when I kicked heroin and other heavy opiates. 
If that doesn’t scare you away from K, I don’t know what will. I just know I lost absolutely everything from abusing opiates before, and I’ll be damned if I fall in that same hole and lose everything again! 

I think tomorrow may be easier because I’ll have work to keep me busy. Who knows?

Also, anything to help heal your serotonin/dopamine receptors etc? I'm 2 hours away from beginning day 6 CT. I know the physical aspect is coming closer to it's end. The hardest part for me has always been pushing day 20-40. The PAWS. I have always caved in and relapsed. So, I'm here asking what is my Greatest defense in battling paws? Throughout last quits, even being hydrated, eating good, hitting the gym and jiujitsu, the paws were still intensely strong. I think I should see a psychologist. I just don't have good insurance, so last therapists I've had honestly seemed not to give a sh*t and or take me seriously (from my personal experience). This quit, I'm taking it very seriously. I need to really focus and address the source, and to heal that piece of myself that I would cover up with Kratom. The thing that frightens me deep within. I need help on which path to take, to truly uproot it and to heal and to help identify it. I have a wife, a 1 year old and a baby on the way. I need to get my shit together and quick! So, please anyone reading this, I need advice. I need to snap into action and change and build something for my family's future. 

Also, a side question I've been dealing with for years, if anyone has some advice for it. I've been bouncing around dead end jobs for the past two years now, surviving paycheck to paycheck. Unfortunately, I'm a highschool drop out and no GED. So, my job options have been very limited. I am sick of stacking boxes and or cleaning toilets. How can I find something that I can feel fulfilled and satisfied? I know these jobs at the least, have been providing for my family with a roof and food. Which I'm thankful for. But, to be honest, these jobs are causing immense chaos within myself as a man. I'd say a big percentage of my depression and stress is directly connected to this. How can I follow my dreams/passions and at the same time be financially successful? I honestly have no clue on how to do this.

I’m trying to get my life together and the worst part is is nobody knows I’m struggling like this. I really don’t know what I should do. My parents would kick me out if they knew but I just need a little push in the right direction. I’ve never been addicted to anything else, but there hasn’t been a day I haven’t taken k since my very first dose in trying it out, it seemed to just fix everything.

My girlfriend of over a year doesn’t even know about this and it eats me up every day to know how fake I am.

I'll be starting regular therapy and attending a group via zoom meetings daily. Those are both things that I didn't do after my last quit, stayed clean for 6 months before relapse. 

I'm lucky enough to have a partner that is very understanding of my situation and is willing to stick around and support me while I go through this.

Despite all of the preparation, this is still the hell that I remember it to be, barely slept last night, very nauseous, digestive issues, temperature fluctuations, and the worst of all of it, RLS and the accompanying body twitches/aches.

2022-01-09 14:48:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/rzzs6y/1_year_clean_and_life_gets_so_much_better/,1 year clean and life gets so much better,"So it's been a year since I stopped taking kratom. I was addicted for 6 years at a 50-65 gpd habit. This substance stole my 20s from me. I quit CT because tapering never worked for me. I have probably 50 spreadsheets of me trying to quit over the last few years. I wasn't even getting any effects from kratom for the last couple years I was just running from withdrawals. I'd dose every 6 hours. When I woke up every day I choked on dirt. Then again before lunch break, then again after work, then again before bed. Oh and if I had to brave the outside world? Had to take another dirt dose because I couldn't deal with withdrawals. Don't forget the 10 kilos of high quality dirt that was stashed everywhere in my house that I threw away when I stopped. 

I looked at this top paragraph every time I felt like I'd falter in the first couple weeks. Read it again and tell me how pleasant that sounds to you. Your brain in those first few weeks will trick you and say it's not that bad or you'll finally get that good sleep if you just take a little more dirt. But with it comes that garbage schedule and life. 

So you might be starting your journey or in the thick of the first few weeks and I'm not going to sugarcoat it, those first weeks suck. I learned some breathing exercises which really helped the anxiety and smoked CBD during the day and hit a THC pen before bed (legal in my state, might be harder to obtain in yours). That was all I did besides taking a good multivitamin (not your store bought pressed pills, those don't work) and drinking lots of water. I found supplements besides magnesium didn't help at all in my many journeys quitting but everyone is different. **Absolutely do not drink alcohol**!! 

I was also going through major relationship issues at the time (she was caught cheating and we were just starting to try and fix it) and my mantra during that time was ""*I'm doing this for me, I'm doing this for her, and I'm doing this for us.*"" It was a very grounding mantra for me and helped me remember why I was doing it. I recommend finding why you are doing this and create a mantra you can repeat to yourself as you pace around at night because you can't sleep. Maybe it's your kids, maybe it's your significant other, maybe it's just for you. Those reasons are why you won't relapse because you won't let them or yourself down again. 

After I'd say 2 weeks I was through the thick of it. After 3 I was feeling just blah and after a month I could tell my brain was healing. After about 6 weeks I was doing perfectly fine. I could sleep again although not great, my RLS was gone, and I stopped smoking the THC and CBD pens. I worked out every other day and just sweat it all out. 

I was talking to my friends again because kratom made me a recluse and I lost a lot of great friends over the years. I'll never forget when I messaged one of my old friends and told him what was going down and I hoped we could grab dinner and catch up and he said, ""brother you are family and always will be. I'm glad you are back and I'd love to have you over for dinner."" People do care was what that taught me.

Some tips for those first few weeks: 

* If you like music experience music without kratom, feel the kick of the drums, let the melody take you away again because on kratom you didn't get to experience that. 
* Go outside and walk. You won't feel like it but do it. Feel the sun, feel the breeze, watch the cars go by and think to yourself, they also didn't have to consume dirt to leave their house and go about their business. Look for someone jamming out to music in their car. They are having a moment and you will have those moments of happiness too. 
* Be kind to yourself. Maybe you are tired and want to sleep, maybe you only ate once today and that's okay. Maybe the best you can do is one load of laundry. Write down your accomplishments because that was all you. Look at that list and realize you are a badass human kicking an addiction and doing laundry or cleaning the house. 
* Maybe you eat like garbage for 3 weeks. Get that taco bell, eat at McDonald's, maybe you just get food through Uber eats every day. Just treat yourself because you are going through hell and don't need to make it any harder. 
* Try and stop consuming material about kratom if you don't need it. I found after two months staying subscribed here was detrimental because it kept me thinking about kratom. I needed to put it far out of my mind to move forward. 

**Some hope it all gets better:**

I will NEVER EVER go back to kratom or any substance like it. You want to know why? I don't look like a skeleton anymore, and I am not so white I'm a ghost. My eyes have life to them again and when I smile I'm legitimately happy. I'm a 6' male and I weighed 120-125lbs when I was taking kratom and I ate once a day at like 10pm. I've been strength training every other day for the last 9 months and I am sitting at 150lbs. I look better than I ever have in my life. I got that v-taper and a great set of abs. My arms, back and chest are getting big and cut. I feel great, I'm not scared to look at myself in the mirror, I take pictures of myself again. I have like 3 pictures of myself from 2016-2021. I have probably 60 from this last year. 

My soon to be ex-wife never stopped cheating on me but that's her loss because I'm leveling up. I make great money, I look great, and my personality is back. Don't need her around for any of those things. If I was addicted I'd have given her yet another chance but I have too much self respect now. 

I go outside now and do live music again. I missed so many good concerts because of kratom and now I'm traveling to other cities to see shows. I have concerts, cruises, music festivals, and personal goals to look forward to in 2022 and not a single one of those goals involve kratom. 

Life gets so much better when you stop taking this dirt so just push through those first few weeks and take your life back. You will be amazed at what you've been missing trust me!",103,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9890642762184143}"

i have been really adament about exercising as much as i can and getting as much natural endorphins as possible... i spent 13 days of wd's just sitting on my ass feeling too heavy to move. one day i just decided to get on my bike and climb this really fat hill by my house, and it felt so good that i've made it a point to ride every single day like i used to before kratom took over my brain chemistry.

For the mental health aspect of wd's, riding my bike along with meditating every morning has been such serious upliftment. I sing HU in my meditations, i know everyone wants to tell me about AUM or YAM or whatever works for them, great! But let me tell you about one you've never heard of..no mantra has ever aligned my will power in such a way as this one, but damn it is powerful potent and efffective. Highly highly highly recommend if youre not feeling so mentally strong. HU is the oldest, most ancient name for God. The implications of chanting the name of God over and over and over again! Powerful shit dudes. I owe Hu so much on my quitting journey. Its certainly the hardest thing i've ever had to overcome. I seriously feel hugged by the cosmos during this healing crisis.

This has physically been one of my easier quits (i have taken ashwaghanda in dry herb form to mitigate physical wd's, diahrrea and anxiety. Magnesium Bicarbonate for RLS, the only 2 supplements i've been using)... but mentally is where shit has been hard. i'm also in the middle of moving which has given me anxiety and even made my chatter brain start coming up with excuses to dose again and get shit done. i won't even feed that voice anymore. i'd rather move slow as fuck than fuck up my bodies already amazing chemistry again.

The only physical effect still bugging right now is my gut microbiome. just get this feeling of a rock in my stomach constantly throughout the day. it gets a little better each day, but thats about it. i'm dealing for now with lots of root vegetables, bone broth eggs and cheese.

so guys I've posted here before about my withdrawals about 7 months ago. That withdrawal itself was caused by the fact that I really wanted to quit, but overall I failed. I feel so ashamed of it, but that's the truth. I got back into the same dose I used to take - which was about 25 - 30 gpd. Now the country where I'm from made kratom illegal and I had no idea about this and didn't prapre for a taper which I was planning to do. I straight up don't have it available anywhere as of yesterday and started going through the withdrawal yesterday. I only have a tiny amount of the K, which is around 2.5 g and that is not at all enough for a proper taper from 30gpd. I went through the night with help from a bit of weed and injesting tiny amounts of kratom throughout the day, making sure I divide it throughout the days as much as I can and sometimes I get this placebo thing where after taking a super tiny amount I feel a tiny inch better, but definitely not fine at all. It's 13:20 right now and today seems to be even worse than yesterday, since I only have 2.5 g of it left and trying to not touch it at all. My symptoms are a huge restlessness, I've been lying in my bed since yesterday, cannot bring myself to do anything, just suffering away in bed and I'm getting a bit emotional right now. Tears pop up out of nowhere with this terrible sadness feeling. I would be able to somehow deal with the mental part, but together with the physical symptoms, it feels super uncomfortable and bad, don't know what to do to get through this. I don't have any kind of medication except ibuptofen and really I have almost no apetite. Is there anything I could do guys? Do you have any tips on how to get through this relatively normally and push the symptoms away a little bit? Thank you so much, I appreciate every single one of you.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9984979629516602}"

I just tapered my caffeine from daily 600-800mg to only 400mg by yesterday. I also tapered my kratom to only 1-2 tbsp a day. It's just weird that I feel more energized and motivated with this kind of tapering. 

I tried kratom CT but it didn't work. Make me feel foggy. But cutting kratom to a very little dose makes me feel better than as usual. Didn't feel like I'm tapering.

Inspiration for Quitting Green Sludge,"For those afraid to take the leap into quitting cold turkey, here's your daily but of inspiration from someone ~100 days in.

So I posted here about 3 months ago that I had finally come clean to my husband that I've been hooked on oxycodone and kratom for almost ten years (we met 5 years ago). I said how scared I was to find out WHO I REALLY WAS, since I'd been stifling my authentic self for a damn decade. I was terrified to take the plunge, scared I'd be a ""dud"" of a person. 

When I first started talking pills, I did it mainly to turn myself into a talkative, proactive person. And wooooWEE, did that work. For a couple years. Then it just drug on and on and on. Fear. The terrible, all encompassing FEAR of quitting, being ""sober"". Would anyone even still like me? Would I like myself? Would I just continue not to live up to any potential, floating through life day by day, nothing changing or improving? 

I figured that if I started taking opiates/kratom to feel more awake/personable/energetic/happy, that if I stopped I'd be the opposite of all those things. 

Well it was quite a journey the first few weeks of cold turkey. Life was HARD. Some days everything was dull. Some days everything was in Technicolor. NOW though, 100 days sober... GUYS let me tell you: I wish I had made this leap YEARS ago. 

I still talk a mile a minute when I'm excited. 

I still LAUGH. 

I still enjoy my hobbies. 

I'm no longer tired every. damn. day. 

I CARE about people and relationships now. I CARE. I text my friends I haven't talked to in a couple weeks things like ""how are you?!"" I call my really annoying aunt lol. 

I no longer have to worry about being in a really low point at any given time of the day, just waiting for that peak of the high to get ANYTHING remotely meaningful done. 

I finally want to take care of myself. I just got done with my first week of an amazing new job. It's the first job I've ever had that actually utilizes my college degree. I feel so important. I finally don't feel like a piece of shit. I can finally begin to start respecting myself. No more HIDING. It's absolutely freeing in comparison to my life on opiates. 

Fuck oxycodone.  Fuck morphine. Fuck fentanyl. Fuck KRATOM especially though; what a sneaky fucking monster of a substance. 

TL;DR - Don't be afraid. You CAN absolutely get back to normalcy. I promise you. Please don't waste any more of your precious time on this Earth.",20,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9678226709365845}"

I have quit kratom twice! The 1st time was in 2016/2017 - I used for like 5ish years, then again in January 2021 - seven months prior I shattered my arm twice and was prescribed major opiates... it was game on after I got a taste.

I've never had any other major addiction issues like I've had with Kratom it's my Kryptonite.

I've been total clean and it's been really good. I am actually able to connect and have a healthy relationship with my daughter, my fiancé,  and my newborn son! I have a other account that I use to post and comment in this subreddit and its so very fulfilling that I get to help others go through what I've put myself through twice.

Here's where I fucked up......

My car broke down(the engine completely seized) about a month ago. I do have another vehicle now but the broke down car is kept at a family house in a neighboring city. I have another vehicle now thankfully

It snowed hard about a week ago and early in the morning I had to drive to my old vehicle to get some e-liquid I had left in there as I was out if liquid for my vape and don't have any money at all to buy any.

On my visit to my car I looked everywhere for e-liquid.... even in the spare tire compartment of my car(this is where I used to keep my kratom) as it's a hatchback. Well I found a small unopened bag probably 1oz under the spare tire that must have been sent as a sample to me long ago and slipped under the tire.

Instead of throwing it away I held onto it. I even mixed it with water and kept the bottle in my backpack. I didn't tell anyone. I could feel all of the temptation every time I saw the backpack!

Four days ago I took it out of the backpack and opened the waterbottle. This is where I was closeted to consuming it. Instead I spilled it and man it got everywhere!!!

I frantically cleaned it up and I moved the bottle of sludge from my backpack to behind a dresser in our laundry room.

My fiancé was cleaning the room late last night and found it. I did a shit job of cleaning every last bit of it up off the old concrete floor - I'm sure she noticed this too .She placed it on my desk and didn't say anything but in the morning I found it.

Immediately -I threw the entire thing out. We still hadn't talked about it but after that I went back to sleep and when I woke up she went back to sleep with our newborn and I took care of our daughter while she slept.

I knew she knew what she found. I knew I needed to talk to her about what happened. It was eating me inside and out so I woke her up and said ""Hey, I know what you found and I'm sorry"". Of course I went onto explain why I had kratom. She said "" I just don't trust you. That's where we are at."" The last thing I want is her believing I'm using Kratom again. I don't even have a job and my bank account is negative so even if I wanted to I have no way of buying any.

Why didn't I just throw it away and tell her? 

I'm on this subreddit every day yet I let myself hide this..... I just can't figure this out!!!!

Why did I let myself get to the point of hiding it and holding onto it? I feel like fucking smeagol.

What is wrong with me?

I want to rip my skin off. I feel like a piece of rotting asshole. I didn't use which is good of course but I don't even have a good explanation to myself why I let this happen.

About 8 grams a day of it which is basically like 32 grams of kratom powder.  Last time I quit I was taking about the same amount but just the powder and not the extract.  Same amount of time as well, about 6 months.  

Well last time was horrible, it rivaled when I quit morphine.  I spent days in bed, writhing in agony.  Couldn't sleep or eat, insane cold and hot flashes, absolutely horrible.   Well I'm on day three this time, the first night u was a little restless, but the next day I felt great.  I thought It might just be a delayed onset but I just woke up on day 4 and I feel amazing.  Completely feel normal, my mood is stable, I slept great last night with no help from any substances!!

I'm so beyond relieved Im not going through hell right now.  I don't really get why I'm not though, is it something do do with just taking the extract?

At the beginning I had mild side effects and mild wds then it progressed.

During occasional use I had dizziness, nausea, lack of concentration, and occasional constipation. When quitting at this time wd was mild - I felt like I needed to sleep for days, depressed, anxious, mild rls, and lack of appetite. Recovered in a week and relapsed a month later because quitting was easy. Did it a second time and quit longer. 

Everyday use started and stayed on for a year before trying to quit. Developed Chronic constipation that changed my movements from a few times a day to once in the morning with straining. Constant fatigue. Appetite suppression and weight loss to the point people were asking if I was on something. Social isolation and social anxiety. I was unable to workout anymore because I was too weak. I went from 180lb muscle to 155lb within a few months. Bad hand tremors. Involuntary jerking limbs at night. Waking up with rls and needing to dose. When quitting ct - disassociated, depressed, anxious, worse constipation, nausea, vomiting, rls, full body aches, sweating, no temperature control, fatigue, and insomnia. Only made it a couple days.

Year 2+ everyday use reduced dose to around avg 30 gpd. Issues from the previous year persist.Early yr 2 I went to my pcp and told them I wanted help quitting kratom. They said they don’t practice addiction treatment and gave me pamphlets for detox. I got blood work done and found my creatinine was elevated in my kidneys. The dr told me to drink water and come back. I didn’t come back. I kept wanting to quit  then giving up hope over and over. I bought a scale and some pill containers to taper and let them sit in my closet. Eventually I worked up the will to cut my dose down a little. After a few days I developed a urinary issue where my stream was restricted. Ejaculation was also effected. I immediately looked it up and found kratom was likely the issue. I joined quitting kratom and started my taper. Followed the taper guide after a few days of trying it my way. The urinary issues persisted. They got a little better but continued. 

I’m on day 9 no kratom and still have the urinary issues. I have a dr appointment soon. No constipation but still have unhealthy looking stools. Pretty much everything else has gotten better.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988332390785217}"

I'm now on day two of CT and it's already starting to get better. The first day was so damn hard! Cold sweats, restlessness, insane depression, insomnia, RLS, the whole gamut! Day two started off ok, I've been taking ibuprofen and Ascorbic acid along with a good diet and lots of fluids, seems to help a lot. I jogged a few blocks for about 15 minutes this evening, got a good breath in, now I'm getting cozy and feeling fairly comfortable. I still have a ""general malaise"", but what's new? Anyways, I know this has been one of strangest withdrawals I ever felt, but I think it's getting better. If you're going through CT right now, just hang in there! Keep your mind occupied! Go for a walk if you can! I know forcing yourself to stay busy is extremely difficult when you're down in the dumps of withdrawal, but It'll be worth it! Pick yourself up! And when in doubt, just know there are thousands of people like you going through the same thing! You'll get through it! Stay strong and never give up!

2022-01-07 23:32:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ryrdhp/day_9_i_think_im_free/,Day 9 - I think I'm Free,"I'm on day 8 or 9 depending on how you look at it. My last dose was last Thursday at 8 a.m. so it's been over a week.

This was my third time quitting and this was hell. I quit before and it was terrible, but only 4 days or so before. I almost caved day 4 and 5 but I feel much better now. Around day 6 is when I started to do high dose vitamin c and it felt amazing. Had some of the best workouts too.

I may be speaking too soon but I do think physicals are done for me. And while it took a while to fall asleep yesterday, I did sleep in and was late to work but they didn't care because they knew I wasn't getting sleep.

I took kratom for about 4 years and I was lucky enough to keep my dose low like 4-6gpd but for a long time. I started when I was 19 for social anxiety and I just hated being in public, except for when I was on kratom. I'm 23 now and I was worried that anxiety would all come back but now I've gone out in public and I feel even better than when I did take it. I kept the dose the same for so long that it just wasn't affecting me other than the 10 minutes when it started kicking and then I wouldn't feel it. I had anxiety still on it in public because I felt different and like there was a secret I had to keep.

So now off of it, in a way way different place in life, I feel good. I thought once a year ago when I had quit just for tolerance reset that it's almost like kratom for me was some sort of exposure therapy to myself by giving myself courage to go out. But off of it I still feel good and I'm just in a much different place than when I was 19. This might be controversial but just kratom didn't really mess with my life and I don't think it's a terrible substance. I quit because I don't think I need it anymore.

Either way, I still did have negatives and decided to quit when I wanted a therapist and thought they would never take me seriously if I just casually had an addiction I didn't want to talk about or try to fix. The waves of anger and good feelings would make me want a therapist, and then feel great later and not care. So on kratom it took me over a year to actually get a therapist because of those waves.

Again though, I didn't take much compared to others. I'm fortunate that I kept it low for YEARS without increase. So that probably does help me with quitting and I may have been closer to reality while on it than those who took higher amounts. But I still was addicted and couldn't go anywhere without it. These past 2 months with the holidays were of course annoying for having to take it everywhere. So not having to do THAT feels like freedom. Being able to say yes to hanging out with friends instead of needing a layer of ""Do I have kratom? Is there a bag somewhere I can take? What if I'm there for a while? How much should I bring?"". I envied that my friends didn't have to think like that and can just live.

My last thing that I would say about this from my perspective as someone who was maybe only taking kratom but never really abusing it to get high - I was still addicted, I still had withdrawals, the addiction on its own without major effects was enough of a negative for me to want to quit. Almost as if I was addicted to a slot machine, but instead of putting in $100s, I was putting in $1s and still couldn't stop.

But I think I'm out now. I hope I'm fortunate enough to not have long-term withdrawal, and I don't think I will. The outside world looks different because it's not like I need to take a backup oxygen tank wherever I go.

I think I'm free, and I couldn't be happier. Goodbye kratom. I'd be lying if I didn't say it's been fun, but I have to let you go. You made me feel better about myself and in a way, I think I learned from that. You showed me what thoughts I had were just anxiety thoughts by taking them away. You gave me courage to do things that scared the shit out of me, but I can do those on my own now. I know you hurt other people and you went easy on me, but I have to stop and it feels right to stop.

I'm closing a chapter of my life because you made me feel fine with the chapter I was in, and while I did enjoy it, I need to turn the page. I'll still be rooting for you on the news for those that can actually benefit from you. I won't fall back and although I'm grateful to take some positives away from what you helped me with, for others you won't be so helpful. That light on its own is enough for me to call it here before things get worse. I know I can't trust you, so this is the only option.

2022-01-07 20:07:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ryndh1/blurry_vision/,Blurry Vision,"Quick rundown. I started using Kratom heavily in 2018 from March to May 50-60gpd. I went ct and it was fairly bad, but the worst WD symptoms cleared up after 5 days. At the time I was using cannabis which I think helped alleviate some of the symptoms, but I’m not sure. I was sober from then all the way until July 2021. 

I should have know better but I began using some supplements for energy like Tongkat Ali and maca root. They made me feverishly workout and hit the gym. So much, I wouldn’t allow my body to recover. I’d go to the gym and lift with my entire body sore and aching. It affected my performance not allowing my body to recover. That’s when I thought I could use kratom as a cheat code and started using again July 2021. Not only did it allow me to ignore aching sore muscles, but in combination with the other supplements, gave me even more energy. I started with 2gpd and my tolerance was so low that I got the energy I needed and then came home and had the best sleep. Over the course of 6 months, 2gpd turned to 4, then 4gpd turned into 6, and I got up to 28gpd.  I became very busy at work and stopped taking many of the supplements I was using for energy and just used kratom. I decided enough was enough and tried to go ct on Dec 28th 2020. It just wasn’t happening, so I started to taper. Then, Jan 4th 2022, I received the Voacatox supplement which is known to lessen withdrawal symptoms from one of the ingredients the Voacanga africana. It definitely works, I’d say that it takes the away 80% of the withdrawals, but it’s not a cure all. I still have most or all the symptoms, they’re just substantially less bad. 

Anyway to the point, I’m at day 3 ct now creeping into day 4. The last time I quit, I don’t remember it affecting my vision as bad as it has this time. I literally can’t see straight, my vision is very blurry. Does anyone know what this is, what the contributing factors may be, and if there’s a supplement that helps with this. I’m a big supplement junkie when I’m not allowing kratom to consume my life. I’m taking most things suggested on this subreddit besides magnesium because the brand I usually get is sold out.

I've had run-ins with kratom habits in the past, with probably the longest being like 3-4 months. I recently got a habit again, of around 10-20gpd, for a little over 1 month. Reading some of the posts on quitting I see ridiculously long withdrawal periods of weeks to even a month. And I can understand why some people might get such long withdrawal as there are those with years of use. But to be honest when I did it for 3-4 months I probably had like 3-4 days of withdrawal stopping cold turkey. Other times I used for shorter periods for 3 weeks or so I'd get like one tired flu-like day. I have a theory it's like a day for a month of use.

I'm definitely noticing a physical dependency at this point, in the mornings I'm yawning way too much and feel like I'm coming on with a cold or flu, until my first dose. I'm ready to quit now as kratom has too many side effects in terms of making you anti-social af and lazy imo. It makes me just want to code or work all day and not workout and meet friends. 

So I wanted to ask what do you all think my withdrawal timeline would look like with my current usage? And should I just cold turkey off the 20gpd now or do a rapid taper halving the dose for like 2-3 days? I'd rather keep all symptoms to zero as much as possible so I can keep my productivity up, but I also think just ripping off the bandaid might be an option with only 1 month or 1.5 months of use.

I take 5 per day which is about 300 per week. It is financially draining me and I really want to quit. I use to work offshore for 2 weeks at a time, then home for 2 weeks. While I was home I took 7 star every day, and when I would leave back offshore I didn't take it with me and would go through withdrawals for about a week and not be able to sleep and it was the worst.

 I have read a little about tapering off but most of what I'm reading is information on switching to powder and weighing it out that way. The thing is I can stomach the powder I instantly throw it up.  Has anyone successful tapered off 7 star, using 7 star? And if so do you have any recommendations on how to taper off with minimal WD symptoms .

 I get off work around 430 and religiously go to the gas station to get my 5.

I work a professional job and have to get up at 340am every morning so sleep is crucial. That's why I've been so scared to quit. I can't go into work sleep deprived and be proficient.

I've seen people mention it so I'm pretty sure there's a correlation to Kratom. I'll wake up and a few of my fingers will be asleep but I'm not sure it's that primary side effect that's doing it. Kratom seems to make me jittery. My picking hand isn't as precise as it used to be like I don't have near as much control. Minimal movement is key and it jumps around more than it used to. Been playing for 20 years and for the longest time while using Kratom I never made the connection. I ran into some Subs just so I could take a break from the Kratom and in days I noticed my playing was normal. This is what caught my attention. Now that I'm back on Kratom it feels like I'm losing control again. This is totally unacceptable for me. I didn't practice thousands of hours to have this end up happening. I've been addicted to every opiate imaginable and only Kratom seems to affect me in this way. I either have to quit it all or if I can't then I'll go back on subs (which seems to depress me) but having my musicianship decline is a lot more depressing than the mental fatigue from Suboxone.

For  reference I take 18 gpd, divided in 3 doses (every 8 hours) and I'm a  long term user (8 years in a few months). I recently found out about  ashwagandha and decided to give it a try, as a tool to combat the  anxiety that comes when I lower my dosage. The thing is ashwagandha  seems to completely block the effects of kratom for me.

I can't find any  information online supporting this, but two other posts mentioned  ashwagandha neutralizing schrooms and parkinson medication.

After 7 years of daily anxiety and private shame, making sure I had my daily supply with almost zero benefit the last 5-6 years, I finally began a daily taper of .05 grams every day.  Simply weighing out my 3 or 4 doses for each day every morning.  It took a year and a half, but absolutely zero withdrawal symptoms.  Sure there was a cheat scoop here and there, but just enough to remind me how empty the pit is.  I measured the doses for my gf too and she had no problem either.  I had most of a kilo left over at the end and let it all fly in a whirlwind around me and out of our lives.  FINALLY!!  I highly encourage you to try the daily taper using a small scale and tiny plastic baggies.  Eventually the act of measuring the green dust becomes more trouble than its worth and you just stop.

Finally said enough and opted to quit cold turkey on January 2nd. Had extremely rough WDs for three days with no sleep, full-body tremors, cracked our french press while washing dishes due to my limited motor functions, and pissed off my partner a couple of times by pacing around the house semi-delirious at like 4 AM and taking a shower at 3 AM. 

I've never had any serious experience with opiate addiction, or any physically addictive drug, and I might be something of a wuss but the withdrawals were excruciating. By the fourth day (yesterday) I thought, ""fuck this, there's gotta be a better way"" and have opted to taper down half a gram a day starting at 8g cut between four doses. Today I am down to 7.5 and don't feel too many negative symptoms, other than some minor depression, RLS, and lethargy. Part of me is ashamed that I couldn't fully cut it CT, but also dropping from 20+g a day to 8g in three days is sort of an accomplishment, I guess. I plan to jump off completely in 10-12 days or so. 

I've read plenty of experiences on this forum of people quitting successfully using both routes that were very educational and inspiring, but I was just wondering if anyone who has had experience with both strategies could let me know what to expect after jumping off completely at 2-3g a day. Are the withdrawals significantly less intense? Also, has anyone had success treating WD symptoms with L-Tyrosine or Ashwagandha? Ordered both online today.

Wondering if anyone has experience with this treatment. It’s a nasal spray rather than an infusion, and it only uses one of the two mirror image compounds that make up ketamine - esketamine.

The real thing that helped was getting omicron and accepting basically sleeping for 3 days straight, which prior that wasn't something I felt would be okay to do. It's been about 8 days.

Only thing that sucks is before I started taking kratom I was diagnosed with acute depressive disorder syndrome and went through a couple different medication combinations such as Lexapro Adderall Clonazepam. After two years I was able to move away from all this medication as kratom sort of served as a stabilizer paradoxically. 
Now I am sort of back at square one of being kratom free and not really even wanting to consume kratom or pharmaceuticals.

I am 27F and have been addicted to kratom for a couple of years now. I have struggled with drug addiction since 14 but mostly have kept it together due to my amazingly supportive husband. I just wanted to rant about my kratom journey/ horror. 
  
Bipolar disorder runs in my family and both my mom and myself suffer from this disease. Two years ago my mom attempted suicide. Her coworker called me saying that my mom was sending weird cryptic texts to him saying how he means a lot and she’s “grateful for the friendship they had”. This was a red flag for me, I figured out what was going on, rushed to her house, and found her about to overdose. I got her into a hospital and they found she had a nearly deadly blood alcohol level as well as the medicine she consumed. She survived, and they told me I saved her. She went to rehab and has been recovering from alcoholism since, and is currently THRIVING. 
  
Though it all turned out well, this event left me traumatized. I’ve taken care of my mom most of my life and I felt like I failed her that night somehow. So I wanted to relapse but not “really” relapse. On a whim I bought some kratom (legal where I live). Because it’s legal I believed it to not be addictive. I didn’t research and didn’t know much about it, I was just looking to get high.
  
I immediately found myself taking it everyday. Having been in this spot before when I was a bad addict, I decided to just try to stop. Immediately I began having physical and mental withdrawals. Only then did I research and realize it was an opioid. Well… fuck.
  
Then, 2020. Besides Covid it was a bad year for me for reasons I don’t want to get into. My kratom usage increased 10x and I found myself eating 30 capsules three times a day.
  
I hated everything. I didn’t (and still don’t) get high from it anymore and was basically just taking it to avoid the withdrawals. Found a therapist and started tapering. It’s been a year now and I am down to 8 capsules, two times a day. On weekends (when I’m off work) I will try to not take it for a day and my withdrawals on these days are much more manageable.

The whole time I was surrounded by cats and dogs, so unhappy, screaming and howling out in pain.
I just sat there twitching and shivering, as every bit of warmth in my body became drained by the cold. Apparently I also caught covid at this time, tested positive a couple days later.
I never imagined a more luciferian hellish existence could happen. I was so sad and worried for my cat who also had to sit in the corner, tired cold, hungry and sick. 
It occurred to me that, below the surface all those years of addiction, this is what was manifesting for me that whole time.

I really didn’t notice the difference pre/post kratom until after the holidays. I have a lot of personal issues which lead to bouts of rage and depression. But recently it has been a LOT less intense than when I was taking the leaf, and even in the months following my final dose.

This makes me wonder, did it really take me 4 months after quitting to start feeling normal? I wonder if kratom had that much of a negative effect on my mood and body.

I used this time for about two weeks but felt immediately my body depending on kratom and got very quickly all the withdrawal symptoms.

I took my campervan out one week before I have to start working again and isolated myself for a few days. Previous quits I got very (socially) anxious and just wanted to hide for a few days.
I downloaded lots of nice series and films, took my guitar (the moment I started kratom again, I didn't play any) and healthy & good foods.

Since the first time I quit I've been taking Magnesium. I think it does help with the RLS.
The biggest game changer for me this time is the VITAMIN C.
I've read somewhere here about it, and had some laying around so I gave it a shot. It's the one that dissolves in water and I take 2 a day which is 1200 mg I believe?

I've been smoking weed daily for a long time, but normally at the end of the day and a few puffs. Also not to be zoomed out watching TV but to play guitar, go for a walk, do something creative etc. 
Now I've taken some extra weed with me in the camper and smoked some more, especially the first few days. Watched a lot of movies, knitted socks and snacked on fruit, went for little walks to stretch.

The first days I get very nostalgic, slowly the feelings come back and I just feel very sentimental. I started playing guitar again, for me thats a great way to 'measure' my feelings coming back. This time I also didn't experience much depression or anxiety, I completely gave in to the 5 days recovering in my den, going inward and not having to do or answer to people. 

I took a walk everyday and did yoga because my back still hurt, but definitely not comparable with the other times where I had major RLS and back pain, couldn't sleep at night etc. 
I've been able to sleep every night before 1am! Ofcourse I cannot say it's because of the vitamin c but it's such a big difference with the other withdrawal. Also barely any RLS and to sleep a full 8 hours was really unexpected for me. 


I understand not everyone has the privilege to take a few days off, owns a camper to get away. It must be so much harder if you have kids, or live with people who don't know about your addiction. Before I took a week off and called in sick. 

I think it's important to give into the withdrawal, especially in the first week to create space where you can do so. Start taking the supplements some time before so you've built a 'level'. Also valerian has helped me in the past with anxiety. When the physical symptoms are not too bad, it becomes much easier. 
Embrace the phases you'll go through, take notes or start journaling. Especially the first time you quit, in my experience it was very intense one I got some feelings and emotions back, I remember the moment candidly, how nostalgic I felt. 
Ofcourse the dullness of it all will come back too, and you think that with 1 spoon or Kratom things will be better again. But it will not, your feelings will be numbed and a few hours later you'll be withdrawaling again.... and for what?",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8987911343574524}"

Time sure has seemed like it’s flow by but I’m embarrassed to say I’ve been doing this green sludge for this long. I was introduced to it by my cousin at a family reunion and after going through a 9 month oxy stint a few years before it gave me a nice little opiate buzz that I got from oxy, and the fact that it was legal and so easily accessible made me think it was ok (my oxy dealer died which forced me to quit, sad to say but it may have saved my life). It started out small and it’s gradually gotten worse over time. I’ve stayed pretty consistent with anywhere from 15-30gpd without having to go up. Well anyways the part of the story I want to get to was that two and a half years ago I started to get some urinary problems. At first I thought it was a UTI. I went to urgent care and they prescribed me meds and I thought it would all be over. 7 days go by and nothing was better. I was then referred to a urologist. He said sometimes you need to be on meds longer for UTI so he put me on 14 days worth of meds. 14 days go by and nothing. At this point I was in the middle of relocating across the country for work so I dealt with the issues and once I got to my new city and got settled I went to a urologist here and he said it might be my prostate. Prostate was fine but he said it may be slightly enlarged so he put me on flomax. I tried that for weeks and it only seemed to make my symptoms worse. Months went by and I went back to see him and said nothing was improving so they scoped my urinary tract and he said it appeared my bladder neck was tightened so they switched me to a new medication for that. The medication seemed to help a little but still wasn’t completely going away. Keep in mind I was doing K during all this thinking it had nothing to do with it. I finally gave up and figured nothing was going to get me improvement. I’ve struggled to try and quit K because of the energy I get, and without it i feel tired all the time. I actually quit once for a month and my wife complained about how lethargic and lazy I was so she said I should go back on it. I’m wondering if all along Kratom has directly been giving me these urinary problems and want to know if anyone has experienced this or know someone who has. This might finally be the reason I can quit because I can’t handle this anymore, my addiction is so deep I’m brushing my health aside in favor of the green sludge. Thank you in advance.

I started with capsules but around Christmas I found out about extracts. I was doing about 25 gpd in capsules by the end of about four months then by bad conversion when I found out about extract I ended up at the equivalent of about 60 gpd on that.

So I know my timeline isnt exactly the years of hard abuse I have seen on here but I finally feel the need to get my story out there. Mostly for me.

I got a DUI in July of 2021 and ended up having to do court mandated drug and alcohol testing. Which sucked but at the time it really got me off drinking and I was so much better for it. It gave me the break I needed to find out for myself that I didnt really need alcohol I needed to work on myself. But curiosity is the fuel of addiction and having heard about the possiblity of a kratom ban I decided to give it a go and see what it was about finally. I mean if it was going to be gone forever I might as well see what it was. 

Very quickly I fell in love with the opiate quality of kratom. It didnt inhibit me the way alcohol did and at just the right dose it gave me the glow of opioid enjoyment with which I dabbled in my youth. Very quickly it went from once in a while to every day. Then upping the dose more and more. All the while not thinking about any possible negative effect it was having on me.

I realized I was quickly going from 20 .5 g caps a day to 30 to 40 to more. But of course I had it under control didnt I? Obviously this wasnt really abuse right?

Then I saw one day they had extracts and ended up giving that a go. Looked like a lot less work for a lot more payout. And it worked. I could take 3 extract pills and feel what I felt from 40 normal pills. Quickly I was reglarly doing 5 extract pills and sometimes re upping with 3 more.

Boy was this getting expensive.  And then one day I realized my stash was running dry. No big deal right? Just call it a tolerance break and I will re up on payday. Wrong, I found out about the rls fairly quickly and had to ration quick to function.

This brought me to my decision to quit. It was just the right time for me. So I did some reading on here and prepared. I finished my extracts on new years eve/day and ended up taking my last 30 g in caps on the second. And so I prepared for it.

The first night was aweful. Unbearable RLS, inability to quiet my mind. Absolutely horrendus anxiety. I could not sleep at all. So I got on here and I read, I knew I had to do it. Luckily the RLS only lasted that first night. But discomfort, anxiety and other symptoms remained. I spend that second day in bed, trying to be comfortable. Nothing worked, I couldnt get the energy to do anything other than watch television paralyzed with anxiety. I still could not sleep but I was feeling markedly better. 

Now today on day 3 I am realizing what a lot of you guys meant about the mental game. I feel a lot better and have been reflecting on how dull and numb kratom made me. Reflecting on the person I was and the person I want to be. And I have realized there is a lot more work to do, but I am ready to do it. I dont want to be numb with alcohol or kratom or anything. For the first time in a long while I am listening to some of my favorite music I havent heard in years and remembering who I was before I numbed myself to near extinction.

I know I havent had it near as bad as some people on here. I know I still have a ways to go. PAWS is possible. Maybe its the pink cloud. I still dont feel 100% but I am feeling.

I also have some benevolent psychedelics I’m thinking to work with over next few days to hopefully help bring out the deeper wisdom I avoid as I binge on drugs that only lead to more craving n ruined health.

But tomorrow will be 10 days and so far I’ve had no kratom this year which makes m voice break with emotion as I dictate this so very proud about that.  But after five years I’ve definitely learned that there can be no moderation with Kratom like picking it up it’s just deciding to start using it every day all day right away and it’s just the nature of the beast for me and I like to think I REALLY KNOW that now  know whereas in the past I kept like trying again to control myself over and over typical addict behavior instead of just giving up yeah we keep trying to control but there’s a lot of other better ways to exert control in one’s life than a perpetual struggle with something both ruining my abundance AND definitely ruining my health in so many areas .

I kicked heroin and everything else 10 yrs ago and did AA. Then I stopped going to AA…over time my mental health issues/bi polar depression/OCD got the best of me. I am an athlete and had to have several surgeries in 2019 and 2020 and couldn’t walk for a year and couldn’t go to the gym which is like my whole identity. And couldn’t travel, which is my other love.😭 That’s a long story short. So I have chronic pain which led me to this “great natural herbal supplement” 😒😒🥲🙄 and immediately my opiate loving ass was hooked and abused it. Got up to 50gpd or more. I got to the point I’d take like 1/4 cup of powder at a time. Just disgusting. So now, 10 miserable months later here I sit…. Because Kratom does this weird thing with your tolerance, like no matter how much you do, you’re still going through withdrawals like all the time! I’ve been going through it y’all!!😢😢😢 So I have been tapering (3rd try, but more structured) for the past 2 months or more. I’ve basically been sick for 2 friggin months, so at this point. I’m over it. And now I’ve just found out that I’m going to need another surgery and I’m pretty bummed, but I’m sticking to the plan and I will not use. Tomorrow is the last day of my taper. I’m down to 1.5g, I sped this past week up a lot. And I flushed a whole bunch of what I had left down the toilet!",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990170001983643}"

I come back to this sub every time when I’m going through this and stay away when I’m using because I’m content and delusional with my abuse. I have hidden this from my wife which has caused all sorts of issues for us. I have five beautiful children that even though I have been there for them for the last couple of years, I have also been numb to all the emotions. I literally feel as though My addiction has stolen almost 3 years of my life. This is attempt #4 for me to stay away. This time I’m trying to treat this differently.

Mostly, that kratom makes you feel like dog shit.

When you’re using every day, you get used to the side effects. Here’s what I noticed:

-the nausea was awful. It wasn’t just right after dosing; I felt nauseous all day from just 10 grams

-kratom is 10% euphoria and 90% dysphoria. After the brief initial high, I was lethargic, cranky, and just felt awful overall

-the euphoria only lasts a couple of minutes, after that I just felt terrible. Lots of rebound anxiety, too.

Hopefully this helps someone out there having a bad day. It’s easy to forget the bad parts.

I believe this is the reason I am where i am today in life and I feel worthless. I feel the anxiety of not being enough, seeing life pass by while I sit still wondering what the hell im going to do with my life. Is this it? Depression hits the hardest for me when I’m not on kratom, intrusive thoughts of the past which knock me down even lower. People who have wrong me tends to aggravate me, my anger has gradually increased and fuse got shorter. I want my life back I remember being a very dedicated and disciplined human being but once I took kratom it gave me such a sense that everything was ok that I just went with it and before my eyes here I am. I already took care of my marijuana dependence but this is no comparison. Also coffee is another dependence I want to let go.

Hasn’t been so bad as I’ve had klonopin and cannabis oil but having been hooked on klonopin in past I’m worried now that I have 3 left worried about how  best to proceed to avoid falling back into the inevitable temptation Kratom will become once klonopin is gone ..

I do feel better so far but know the klonopin is preventing me from truly cleansing.

But I’ve had enough and am desperate to not fall back to kratom.  I have a huge about of gabapentin which I figure I’ll use as klonopin runs out then just taper but I guess I’m just scared and each times I’ve ‘quit’ kratom by just using another substance it just doesn’t end up working.

But it’s gotta end sometime and after this long I just KNOW There no ‘just once’ for.  For me kratom always ends up being about a heaping teaspoon per hour.  

Any and all advice it welcome.  Definitely don’t want to get more klonopin as it did it’s part to help get me a week off kratom but it’s even worse for me so KNOW they both must go.

Gabapentin made quitting kratom
Almost too easy in past but it too is addictive with what can be deep irrational depression out of nowhere.. thinking I’ll just get back to yoga tomorrow and gym as been very lethargic this past week but getting more energy and hope I wasn’t on klonopin long enough for withdrawal
To b too horrible., was just over a week but pretty continual use..

So hope gabapentin helps with klonopin withdrawal enough to avoid kratom relapse and be easy to taper off..

I also have capsules for microdosing psilocybin, a bunch of dried shrooms and a dmt cartridge I’ve been kinda intimidated to use.  Tho typical
Addict logic I almost wonder if these could help sorta shatter my ego n hopefully come back more willing to resist kratom.  So would love any input in that tho definitely don’t want to trigger anyone

Just rso helps immensely with kratom withdrawal so may just try to keep adding more of that as I phase of all the helper meds than just gradually quit that too as it’s not at all addictive for me.  I always crave the kratom
And benzos but never the psychedelics.. helps me Know which r the true Medicines 

Just Feel my true self struggling to emerge from this slimy kratom cocoon that’s do insulated me from a series of horrific events.. BUT now life is good n I’m
Just holding on to a crutch that I don’t need and know it’s limiting my capacity to really live and love again.

Sorry to ramble but think I’m ready to finally do  this and welcome all input especially from my fellow cosmonaut wizard types!  Lol

I feel like my recovery has been slow yet steady. I’ve hit paws yesterday with unbelievable lack of motivation and brain slowness. 
I also developed a pretty shitty flu which has me in tremendous pain. Right now is probably the most pain I’ve been in throughout this quit.
For some reason I have this brooding reassurance that my body is resetting through this high ass fever. Through resting hard as fuck. My brain is feeling happy and pleased to just be laying here healing. I have always had a rigorous spiritual practice and always hungry to seek God, this opportunity has brought me closer to myself than I’ve felt in years. I’ve never made it quite this long before! Might be my fifth quit now... done for good this time. Every day the cravings get easier to shove off. They do come though. Meditation gives my mind and gut the will power to push through like warrior strength! I’m in the middle of moving into my bus and I am very excited to spend the next couple months getting to know myself even further at the beach or in the hills.
Coming off of kratom has made me see how much the nuances of the way I was living were a lie. I would not have lived this way sober. I had a huge reckoning, and felt the only way is a complete life shift. It feels tremendous and is generally how I’ve always over come my crisis moments, however I am one of the more unique circumstances you guys may hear of. I am a painter writer musician and philosopher, I through kratom made those endeavors better but they only became hollow. I feel very supported in sinking into absolute healing healthfulness. No matter how much my body is suffering right now, I dream of the girl I was before this stuff got a hold of me! I was so active and traveled this whole damn world with utter effortlessness.

Ive been on and off these past few months but on day 3-5 i tend to fall into a fantasy of using in my head and end up saying fuckit and get some more kratom and put off my quit. I have 3 fucking days left at this job. I just need to get through them. Then i can finally leave all this negative energy behind here and go and live life like a normal person. Kratom has done so much bad in my life, its insane i kept making excuses and taking it. If i never relapsed, i would be over 365 days today. But after 8 months, i decided to try it again. Look how that turned out. This time quitting is much more of a mental battle rather than physical. But i dont want to be like this anymore, so im not going to.

I’ve been having signs of swollen prostate and was curious if anyone else developed this under 40. I’m 31 yrs old and was using 30 gpd for 2+ years. I had to go frequently while using kratom but didn’t have any kind of retention. Now I’m having more issues mainly at night like it’s being squeezed when I go.

I went to the doctor and told them I had been on kratom when I started having issues and have been off for 13 days. The doctor immediately said it should clear up and can take 30 days or so after opiate use. They said urine looked ok and they drew blood. I will have results in two weeks and have another doctors appointment on the 25th.

Doctors appointment 1/25/2022:
My bloodwork came back fine. No issues with kidneys, liver, or infection. The doctor basically told me he thinks it’s mental lol. This is even after I told him I have started getting soreness in my pubic area since last week. I still go every 30 mins without caffeine. I still have to take like 10 mins at night to start a stream. I still have issues with ejaculation where it does not release everything and constricts it. I guess some of the other things have improved but it’s still there. He also prescribed me adderall because I add was in my medical history smh. He didn’t do any other tests for the retention. I’m going to watch my symptoms and do what I can to get better. If they don’t improve I’m just going to the ER to get all my tests at once.",5,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9854397177696228}"

This tip i give too you will be a life changing.

So first of all buy Vitamin D3 2000iu , vitamin k2 and magnesium (citrate or bisgynclate.

When WD kicks in about 24-36hour mark then start take 1 pill D3 with breakfast with fat, afternoon take vitamin k2 with dinner and before bed take magnesium. The all three works togheter and will help with WD but remember D3 takes 4-6 days too kick in and keep taking these supplement and it will help with mood/energy/sleep and deppression.

I have taken these supplement for 2 years and it helps with alot of things, it will not cure the WD but will get you energy and feel less shit.

And the last thing i wanna say is exercise , take a walk or hit the gym even if you feel shit just do it and after 5-10 minutes you will feel much better.

This may not work for everyone but trust me the best is D3 and exercise.

Good luck ladies and gents and keep fighting this green sludge!

EDIT: Don’t take vitamin d3 afternoon it can ruin your sleep. Always in the morning!

EDIT 1: its a good thing is too take a blood test and check your D levels before supplementing it but trust me if you are not outside in the sun for 30min-1 hour a day or lives in hot climate country you can follow this guide but always check with DOCTOR and do test.

I began with a couple green Maeng Da pills a day, and then moved up to the Gold Shots on a tip from a lady at my local convenience store. Then the OPMS Black shots came out, and now I'm hitting a shot every 12 hours or so, one upon waking, another at night. For a while I was hitting a Black and a Green shot at night. 

This god awful sludge.... I have to take a sip of lemonade or dr pepper to even swallow the stuff and unless I follow up with a pack of gum I'll straight up vomit. 

I work out a lot. I've noticed my endurance and strength has tanked since being on this stuff. I'm stuck at a plateau that is lower and slower than I ever was back when I was just smoking herb. 

I get addicted to everything. I was addicted to hydrocodone for almost 2 years before this, and have smoked MJ for nearly 20 years now. Crazy to think it's been that long. When I started using Kratom, I just randomly quit smoking herb one day and haven't touched it since. 

Ugh I also smoke cigarettes. My routine is to buy a shot of opms blacks and a pack of Marlboro blue 100's, I'll smoke the whole damn pack in a matter of hours. 

Then I'll do it all over again at night. 

I do Beachbody's Insanity Max 30 program daily with weight lifting mixed in. I honestly don't know how the hell I haven't killed over yet, smoking 2 packs a day with Kratom and doing intense cardio is a horrible combo. But working out is the only thing that keeps me sane and I notice my morning and evening withdrawal symptoms, as well as my poor lungs, get far worse when I don't. 

Worst of all, I haven't spoken to anyone about this and am totally a closet addict. I found this board and after reading everyone's stories I have found much comfort. 

Every time I've managed to quit anything it's always been CT. I'm an all or nothing kinda dude. 

I don't have it in me to taper. Plus OPMS ehots are expensive. As are cigarettes. My freaking bank account is currently overdrawn. Over the past few days it has become incredibly clear just how badly this is ruining my life. 

I have enough food for a few weeks so I'm not gonna starve but I straight up can't even afford the kratom I would need to taper right now. I can't afford cigarettes either. 

So now I'm faced with CT quitting both Kratom and Cigs. 

I just wanna be healthy again. My digestive system is totally FUBAR'd. I wake up every morning with the sweats. I can't take it anymore. I'm living the life of a hermit now and nothing I previously loved gives me joy anymore. I even built a moderately sized social media following from writing and I just abandoned it. Haven't produced anything in months. I don't play guitar anymore. I don't play video games anymore. 

I just drive endlessly around back country roads high off Kratom and chain smoking. 

I made a decent money freelancing before but at this point I barely even produce enough to get by. And I can't even seem to manage that anymore as, I'm totally broke now. My car is falling apart. I've put nearly 70,000 miles on it just this year. 

I started the Kratom habit around January of last year. So I just passed my 1 year mark. 

Literally never felt this low, or this alone. Hundreds of people have messaged me asking where I've disappeared to and if I'm okay, but I can't even bring myself to message them back because opening my inboxes gives me major anxiety, and I'm not even sure why at this point. 

I just want my life back. I didn't expect to rant this long but if you're still reading this I am extremely grateful to you. 

I'm just trying to gauge what I'm about to experience. 

Like what is the equivalent to a Kratom Black shot in dry leaf grams? I'm not even sure what to compare it to. I see people having withdrawals from 10-14 grams a day, I know some people are using an Oz+ a day, when up to 100+ grams. 

I have no idea where I'm at on this spectrum. All I know is after 12 hours I start to feel that nasty dopesick sensation that I've come to dread more than anything, even a negative bank account. And that is just depressing. 

The Kratom Black bottle says it's 50:1 extract, Mytragynine - 48%, about 180mg per bottle. It also says 7 - OH <2.2%, <8mg per bottle. 

Am I just being a wimp? 

Ugh. Any help/advice/support would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you all so much for your time, and I deeply appreciate this subreddit, and thank you to the people sharing your own stories as well. It is helping my mindset tremendously right now.

If you count day 0 as the last day I took but also the first day I stopped taking, then I'm on day 5. If that was day 1 then I guess I'm on day 6.

I've quit before and I know these symptoms, but I was fine after a few days the last times I quit. This is somehow so much worse. The frequency and amount I took, unless I was mistaken, is about the same.

But I'm still getting 0 sleep. I'm still getting RLS which I don't think I've ever had for more than 2-3 days. Day 5 night sleep was somehow worse than day 3. Day 1, 2, 3 got progressively better and now the daytime is ok for the most part but sleep is still nowhere to be found.

I lie down and think holy good God my body feels fine now I can sleep. Then the moment I start getting close to sleeping, my body decides it RLS time.

I'm so close to cracking just because I need a break from this. I need one good night's sleep from just a half a gram to help let me sit still for one God damn night because my work is suffering. I waited until new years because 3 day weekend and that is the amount of time I usually needed before. I can't wait 2 fucking weeks before I can sleep again. This is insanity.

I also am taking magnesium but idk if it's the right kind, just had black seed oil delivered from Amazon, have a bit of CBD but that usually never did much for me unless I treat it like alcohol and consume as much of it as I can.

I know you probably feel like shit and that it would be easier to give in. I'm here to tell you it will get better.

I got completely clean last April. I had spent at least 5 years taking large amounts a kratom everyday. I never measured, just scooped my tablespoon into the bag every few hours or so.  I was exhausted everyday, still in pain, couldn't shit, bloated, my hair was falling out and even though I no longer was taking pain pills, I was still spending a lot of money buying kilos just so I wouldn't feel like more shit without it. I mean it was totally asinine. I was trying to feel better, and now I was stuck just trying not to feel worse. I was worried about my health and felt like I had no where to turn.

Now last year around this time I had decided to taper. Oh boy were those first weeks of the year fun. I was slowly tapering and although I didn't feel horrible withdraws, I missed dosing when I wanted and how often I wanted. I started by only allowing myself 4 tablespoons a day. I stayed their for a long time. By early feburary I had gone down to 3. I was just moving at my own speed and even though in my head it felt like it was taking for ever, I knew I was making small, but significant progress. 

March is where it got a little crazy. I decided I didn't want to buy from my normal supplier and switched to head shop kratom. it was trash. that switch alone put me into some nasty withdraws but I kept going down and made a jump to 2 teaspoons a day, a big jump. I wanted to be done with it so bad, so the next drop, i decided to quit, april 7.  I wanted to be over it. I didn't want to keep drawing this out. I started the last withdraw of my healing. 

I went through hell, I know we all know what it feels like. Cramping, shitting, sweating, feeling like we have no end in sight, guilt, humiliation, the how did I let this happen? Why did I do this to myself?

Trust me when I say it all gets better with time. I love waking up and not having to take something to not feel like shit. I love being able to travel and not worrying if I'm going somewhere kratom is illegal and having to explain it. I love feeling my emotions again, the good and the bad and feeling motivated without having to take something first. 

I know a year is a daunting long time when you're at the starting line, but I promise it's going to get so much better. Yes, hurdles will need to be jumped along the way, and thats okay, but I remember last January thinking about how I was never going to feel myself again and I do feel normal again. I feel great and getting clean while being in chronic pain and being away from kratom and opiods for the first year in over a decade was hard, but one of the proudest things I've done for myself. I have emotions again. I'm not attached to a leash anymore. I can do this life thing without a crutch. 

Anyways, I have a hard time articulating what I want to say, but I jsut wanted to come here and let you all know it's going to get better. You will feel yourself again. You will stop sweating all the time and be able to sleep again and your poop will eventually get back to normal. Just stay strong and keep going one day at a time. Try not to think about how long its going to take and just go for the ride. I remember realizing one day i wasn't sweating like a crazy person, just out of the blue. Or one day I just felt motivated again. 

Other things I'd say are musts.

drink lots of water or other hydrating drinks, even when youre not thirsty. 

Exercise, even if you want to lay in bed all day, exercise just an hour or better yet, small 15 min exercises throughout the day. I have a bad back and nerve damage in my leg, so I would literally walk circles in my living room up to 5 miles a day. (it really isn't that much. 15-20min spread out adds up)

make a list of things you can do to distract yourself when cravings hit. It can be small chores you need done, or a show/movie you wanted to watch. maybe a metal earth kit. whatever, make the list cause when those cravings hit you aren't yourself and it can be really hard to think rational in the moment. 

I don't know if supplements work or not, but taking them made me feel like I was trying to feel better so it comforted me in some way. 

Don't chase sleep, it made me crazy not being able to sleep, but getting up and doing something else made me feel better, a hot shower, a brain puzzle, anything but laying there thinking about how sleep will never come. 

heated blanket really helped my RSL. I don't know if it helps everyone, but it calmed mine down much like a hot bath does.

it’s debilitating. even at .5g

ik it’s the kratom bc right when it was getting better, i took kratom & it got bad again. now i’ve been off for 2 days; & the urgency & uncomfortableness isn’t as bad. i wanna justify that it’s not kratom but it prob is.

I thought it could be a good idea to share our own timelines for recovery as we head into the new year- it's a good way to remind ourselves and each other of why this is worth it! Anything you want to share might help someone reading. It's also just a very positive and motivating topic. :)

I'll start, and for reference, I tapered for a couple of weeks and then quit from an approximately 2 year habit at about 10g/day. Today is 20 days CT for me.

 I noticed a drastic improvement in my skin by day 7 or 8, and it continues to improve in texture and elasticity. I was having a lot of problems keeping my hair and skin moisturized by the end, and I'm already noticing a lot more life in my hair and skin now. 

My emotions started to come back by day 2/3, but continue returning even stronger, I've been having a lot of both highs and lows since probably day 8 or so. 

My immune system is very sensitive now, but completely functional- I got a cold while tapering, and now I'm getting seasonal allergy symptoms pretty strongly (mostly a stuffy nose), and lots of sneezes like all of you. 

My energy was pretty low the first week, but after that I noticed it starting to come back slowly day by day. I don't -need- coffee the way I used to in the mornings. 

Social outings are much more enjoyable than they were- I feel like I have so much more fun meeting new people and just having conversations with others. I'm so much more easygoing and relaxed not having to worry about my next dose. I'm a lot less irritable and impatient. I noticed all of this really starting to surface by day 6 or 7. 

My natural motivation is coming back as well, definitely slower than some other things, but by week 2 I had some good days where I was deep cleaning and getting chores done that I would've had to force myself to do on K. Tapering and my first week CT, my motivation was pretty much gone, but it's been coming back, and isn't dependent on me taking a substance anymore. 

My eyes are brighter and clearer! I am sleeping much, much better than I ever was on k. By day 5 or 6, my eyes had cleared up completely and look bright and even blue now, compared to always looking dull or red. I would wake up looking bloated and tired with dark circles, that are slowly getting better. 

I would often want to sleep so long while using, and never felt really rested when I woke up. Now, I feel so much more rested in the mornings and like my sleep is deeper. The first few days it was hard not to instinctually reach for a dose to wake me up in the mornings, but now that I'm past that first week, I've come to really enjoy the clear-headed feeling of waking up sober and rested, and I feel like kratom just immediately takes that away from you. 

My metabolism has picked up a lot since quitting! I'm eating a lot more than I was while using, like many of you I was eating less to maximize my doses. Even though I've been eating a lot more, I haven't been gaining much weight- just getting the nutrition my body needed all this time. I was always so bloated around my stomach while on kratom, even eating hardly anything, and would gain weight pretty easily while using. By the end of week 1 I noticed my body was much less bloated. Slowly my digestive system is starting to heal and speed back up as well, I would say only now in week 3 is it really getting back to normal movement-wise. 

I lost a lot of muscle while on kratom and was unable to really put any on despite my best efforts, like many of you. I've noticed already my body looks like it has better shape and tone to it, despite having no time at all these last few weeks to work out. I anticipate that when I do start regularly working out, I will see actual results so much more easily than I did while using.

My aches and pains are pretty much gone now, and have been since probably day 15 or so. I occasionally have some issues with restless legs, and initially had RLS symptoms at night, but nothing too unbearable. That has gone away and I can go to sleep without a problem. I'm on my feet at work so lately I've been noticing some movement-related pain in knees or feet that I hadn't before, but I consider this a positive, because kratom was just masking this pain and inflammation before. 

While tapering and about a week into CT, my body had a hard time regulating temperature and I had some dramatic swings from normal to freezing cold or really hot. After that, this symptom got better pretty quickly. I actually feel warmer now on average than I was feeling day to day towards the end of using, and I am someone who runs very cold to begin with! I'd convinced myself I couldn't get through winters without kratom, but this is very untrue.

I'm just barely starting to notice some neurological improvements in things like memory as well, these probably heal on much larger timescales though.",11,"{'immun': 1, 'mask': 1}","{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7463899254798889}"

As the title says I've been taking Kratom every day since mid 2016. If I were to estimate, I'd say my dosage would be anywhere from 30-50 grams a day. Like most people, I discovered kratom as a method to improve my quality of life and work ethic. And oh man did it work. Fast forward to today and I now own my own restaurant and I'm making way more money than ever before. I should be happy right? Well, I have a loving Fiancé and beautiful 9-year-old daughter which I'm truly greatly for. However, along the way I've become very dependent to kratom. Especially when it comes to work. While I own my own place now, we are extremely busy and these past 13 years of restaurant work have done a huge number to neck, back, and shoulders. So now I'm dependent on Kratom for mood regulation (I need it just to feel normal) and to help manage my pain. Luckily my family is very supportive, and they understand why I take it. However, They DO NOT know just how bad my addiction has become though.

Last month as a gift to my Fiance, daughter and nephew I bought us a Universal Studios vacation package! This takes place in June and I'd really like to not take Kratom while on vacation with them. The powder is messy and I'd have to take Kratom every couple of hours just to regulate my mood or else I'll feel like crap most of the time. June is my target month to be completely off.  I will be taking 10 days off very soon to try to CT. However I can see that easily failing but I will try.  Any recommendations how to go about quitting from such a high dose? Thanks for the help!

TLDR: Been taking large amounts of Kratom daily since 2016. Looking for recommendations on how to quit while also run a business. Looking to be fully off by June.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9967488050460815}"

My use has just continued to go up over the years and reached as high as 60-70 gpd. About 5-6 months ago I had a trouble getting some, as in the UK, so was forced to rapid taper from about 60-70 grams to about 5-10 grams in the space of 2 weeks. Towards the end of that I was really struggling as I couldn't sleep at all. 

The whole body had restlessness and I tried everything I could get several types of magnesium, to epsom salts, to black seed oil and nothing worked. This was the worst symptom for me. 

As was so bad to function at work with zero sleep I crumbled and bought more and planned to taper long term. 

However over the months my use just kept going up. I struggle with social anxiety and depression quite a bit, so especially hard for me to go into work without my crutch. But again this could be the kratom doing it, as my motivation is as low as its ever been and find myself getting anxious over little things. Anyway I managed to up my dose to as high as 50 grams a month or so back, but over the weeks since then I'm hovering around 20-25 grams a day. 

I'm just wondering how I quit for good. From experience is it possible to rapid taper over a few weeks and have withdrawals being bearable? 

The thought of a very long taper however is concerning for me though, as it involves continuing to get more. 

If you were to do a rapid ish taper over the next month or so, how much would you drop from 20 gpd, over the next few weeks? I guess i'm just looking for some help. Any advice? If it wasn't for the RLS and lack of sleep i'd probably have jumped already.

Anyways, quit last year for a few months, then started using occasionally which soon became a daily thing. I was able to quit after I dosed for the first time 2x a day again.

Fast forward a few months later, I now find myself with the RLS up at 2 am again.. 
I dosed 4 times yesterday, after already a few days of dosing more than 1 once a day. and the withdrawal comes so quickly, I can feel my body every day becoming more dependent and 'longing' for the kratom. 
The RLS and back pain keep me up tossing and turning in my bed. 

This time I saw how quickly the bad of kratom starts to outweighs the good with the mood changes and annoyance. Not feeling the music any more, not being able to laugh. I remembered feeling this way and then especially with the first withdrawal, where I suddenly started to feel a lot at once, and the first time really hearing music again. 

This time I am consumed by the physical withdrawal, and I know that it will be over soon considering the length of my relapse, but it gives me such a realization what this shit does to my body, how its in pain and screaming for a dose again. and I know it will instantly relieve the pain but it's just not worth it. 

Overall the effects aren't worth it - I much more enjoy a few puffs of good weed and get creative. But the Kratom helped me with my energy levels and therefore my depression and just getting shit done. So I focused on my health, started working out, eating nutritional whole foods, slowly getting my life back. lost a few friends on the way but now I'm making new travel plans and bought a camper and am excited about life again. 
Going to the withdrawal again, I'm grateful for the RLS that makes me realize it's all in my head (but so is everything). that the nostalgia and sadness are coming from the Kratom, not depression. and that the work that I've done isn't not worth anything because of this relapse.

I’m having trouble sleeping right now.

I decided to quit for good on New Years Eve.

Additionally, I’m at a resort facility with my family right now. I knew I’d go through WDs but damn if I didn’t underestimate how bad they’d be.

I did a little research and found out about the “kindling effect”. Basically, if you quit over and over again (like yours truly) it’s possible that the severity of WDs can be more intense. (There’s a physical reason for this if you look it up)

Anyway, I am definitely “kindled”. This shit is straight up hell.

Everyone is asleep in the room here completely oblivious to the fact I’m in my own personal hell right now.

To make matters worse, I decided to drink a few beers today to loosen up. (Note that I rarely drink anymore as I’ve had problems with that too.)

I didn’t go too crazy (5 beers over the course of about 6 hours) but I can already feel the onset of a “mini hangover”…all of which I will be able to enjoy in exquisite detail due to the fact it is physically impossible to sleep.

Think I’m quitting drinking tonight for good measure. I need alcohol like I need a hole in the head.

2022-01-02 19:27:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/runy0e/day_1_ct_and_an_interesting_anecdote_regarding/,Day 1 CT and an interesting anecdote regarding Vitamin C.,"I wanted to post and share a little bit about what’s been going on the last couple of days. For context, I used Kratom for a year or so many years ago, quit for over a year, and then in April 2020 during the lockdowns in New York City I started using it again and have gradually worked my way up to a 20 to 30 GPD habit. Primarily I’m wanting to quit because it just does not make me feel as good as it used to, 50% of the time it makes me feel very yucky, and in addition I have been having shortness of breath, that I thought was long Covid, but I’ve been checked out by pulmonologist and other doctors and they gave me a very clean bill of health. 

I knew things were getting out of hand about three / four months ago when I started regularly waking up in the middle of the night, usually around three in the morning feeling extremely uncomfortable and unable to go back to sleep, thus needing to dose again in the middle of the night. If you keep on reading, please note this. 

I attempted to quit a year ago, but only lasted two days because it was incredibly unbearable, and since I live with my girlfriend I just feel so incredibly ashamed and pathetic with her here with me watching me go through all this. I also get very emotional, hostile and angry so I don’t like her being around because that ends up getting taken out on her. Since that last attempt, we moved a couple of hours upstate. My girlfriend goes back and visit the city to see friends about once a month, so I discussed with her if she can go away for more than just a weekend and visit some friends in the city, which will give me a good opportunity to quit. 

The plan was for her to leave Friday the 31st through Monday the 3rd giving me a window to get through the worst of it. I woke up Friday after she had left and pretty much made it through the entire day. It was excruciating, I was sweating like crazy but then would get really cold, all the usual withdrawal symptoms of yawning with tears pouring out of my eye, full body discomfort, extremely emotional to the point where anything sad on TV made me cry, etc. It was completely unbearable and I could not sleep so around midnight that night I ended up taking about 2 g to help me sleep. Then yesterday when I woke up I made it about an hour before I took a regular dose, and then proceeded to take about 1/2 as much as I would during a normal day throughout the day. At that point I was pretty much ready to give up on  trying to quit because it finally felt good again and brought me so much relief compared to withdrawals , but then I thought about how my girlfriend made special arrangements to go away, even taking an extra day off work and being ok with not celebrating New Year’s together, which made me feel really guilty so I decided I really need to make the stick.

I spent a lot of time lurking this sub Reddit the last few days and noticed a couple of people mention stuff about taking lots of vitamin C when quitting. I was skeptical, however after thinking about it something struck me. About a month ago, I got sick, so I started taking my vitamins and supplements more regularly. I have continued taking them regularly since, as I have a tendency to get sick a lot I figure I should really take care of my immune system throughout this winter. One of the supplements that I take is vitamin C, and I always take my supplements at night because I generally intermittent fast through most of the day and eat a big meal at night, so I take my supplements a few hours after that big meal before bed to avoid the stomachache. After thinking about it for a moment, I realized that in the last few weeks, although my daily usage has been normal, I have not been waking up in the middle of the night at all needing to dose. I found this to be really interesting, And gave me some anecdotal evidence that vitamin C may help with withdrawals, because I was no longer having withdrawals in the middle of the night.

Now today is my first day cold turkey again. Last night, I took a pretty large dose of vitamin C before bed.
This morning when I woke up I took vitamin C right away and felt pretty good most of the morning. Definitely had more energy and emotional stability than I did when I woke up Friday morning when I tried to quit. I was much more easily able to drive to town and do some errands today, one of which was picking up some other supplements that I’ve read about and powdered vitamin C so I could take more and have it work more effectively. I then started taking vitamin C powder every two or three hours. It has helped so much it’s unbelievable. By no means do I feel like I’m still at my peak of pleasure high on kratom, but my withdrawal symptoms, and general unease / emotional instability is probably 20% of what it was on Friday before I started taking much more vitamin C. In addition, on Friday I was completely bedbound and could barely get up to go to the bathroom and make myself meals, however today I went to town, did a handful of errands, stopped by a local gym and signed up for a membership, and then did about three hours of manual labor on my farm in 15°F weather with gusting winds. It can be possible that perhaps by going through withdrawals all day Friday, and then taking less throughout the day yesterday that I potentially got much of the withdrawals out of my system already, however from what I remember days two and three are way worse, so if this was the case, that would probably mean that today should still be very hard for me. 

One potential caveat - After a few hours of doing manual labor outside, I had to drive home due to extreme stomach cramps. It was excruciating to the point where I could barely stand up straight, and reminded me very much of what it felt like when I had Alcoholic pancreatitis a few years ago. I drove home, laid down in bed, and felt better 15 minutes later. I have read accounts of vitamin C in high doses  upsetting the stomach for the first couple of days, however that usually comes along with diarrhea which so far I have not experienced. In total the discomfort lasted probably 30 to 45 minutes And I have taken more vitamin C since with no issues.

As a sidenote, I remember the first time I quit years ago it took me a very long time to get my sex drive back, and the way that I felt on Friday I cannot imagine having a sex drive in the slightest. I do not want to share too much, but I will say that my sex drive is well above baseline today, which I think is an interesting phenomenon. 

I really wanted to share this because based on my recent experience with vitamin C helping me make it through the night, and then how I feel today using vitamin C to mitigate with withdrawals, I think that it may be the vitamin C that’s helping me. I understand that this is not concrete evidence and everyone is different, but with everything going on in the world right now there is a real attack on the scientific process, especially when it comes to randomized controlled trial being the only acceptable form of study and stuff like that. I wanted to mention that through us discussing things that work and things that don’t work, anecdotal evidence, etc. we are participating in what scientists like Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying call “citizen science”. Perhaps this is not exactly what they are speaking of when they use that term, however it is close enough and I’m sure some useful information could be gathered if one were to compile reports on this sub Reddit of peoples experience with taking vitamin C throughout the quitting process.",10,"{'lockdown': 1, 'covid': 1, 'immun': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980765581130981}"

Day 5 CT (Positivity Thread),"Right now I'm **117 hours and 53 minutes from my last dose** after 5 months of heavy extract use (**3-6 shots per day**). Things are not ""easy"" by any means, but with every passing second I can feel myself getting better.

For some context, I'm a 24 year old male, 6'0"", 160lbs. I've been an addict/alcoholic since I was 15 and used kratom from time to time, but after nearly 3 years of total sobriety, I began using kratom every day about **5 months** ago. I decided to do a **2 day mini taper** in which I lowered my dose from 3-6 shots to 75% of one shot in the morning and a 50% of one shot at night. I would have tapered more gradually but I couldn't stand the thought of prolonging the suffering, and I'm happy I didn't.

**The first 48 hours** after my last dose were undoubtedly the hardest. I've had severe crippling anxiety my entire life and I had been using kratom to treat it, so when I stopped it was the symptom that came back the hardest. My heart was pounding a mile a minute and I could feel the adrenaline pouring out of me.

On day 2 I was prescribed a **beta-blocker** called **propranolol** which works by slowing the physical symptoms of anxiety (**adrenaline, heart rate, shakes, sweats, etc.**). In my opinion it was very helpful in getting me through those first few days. For all I know it was just the placebo effect or the natural improvements that came with the passing of time, but as soon as I took it I felt major improvements. Now on day 5 I don't feel like I need it anymore, but it's nice to know I still have it. 

Oddly enough I slept like a baby the first 2 days, but night 3 and 4 have been noticeably more difficult. Each of the last two nights I've slept a total of 5-6 hours over the course of a 10 hour window, but I'm optimistic it will only get easier from here.

I've been lifting weights obsessively for the past year (something for which kratom gave me a lot of energy and motivation.) Working out is one of the few things that brings me peace, so on day 2 I somehow managed to crawl into the gym but couldn't make it 15 minutes before I had to leave. I decided to take off day 3 and returned on day 4 and 5 for some relatively enjoyable workouts.

This is all to say that **my experience has been better than what I expected**, and I think that reading some of the horror stories on this sub only served to intensify my anxiety. 

I know that everybody's experience will be different. Some have been using for longer than I have, or more heavily. Regardless, I think it's important to share **the positive things about getting off this drug**. Things will not be easy, but in the long run it will certainly be better.

Hard to believe it has been 41 days of no sludge. Man, it has been a rough and strange journey...used on and off (more on) for the last 2 years, whenever I wasn't doing other drugs/opiates. At my peak I was at 60 GPD, but managed to taper down to about 10 GPD, from which I just said ""screw it"" and jumped. Tried to many times before and failed. The longest I lasted before this quit was 2 weeks...needless to say, feeling VERY glad about that! No more waking up in the morning and running to the dirt to feel 'better' for my work day. Acutes are long gone. Cravings are far and few, but I have managed to squash them by the grace of God.

One thing I will say that seems to persist is this very strange, constant, and weird feeling of indecision, aimlessness, and anxiety. Like, even if I have something in my head that I have to do, I'll just procrastinate FOREVER before I finally do it. I will literally just sit and stare at nothing (or doom scroll) instead of kicking myself into action to accomplish the task that needs attention. It is SO odd and frustrating. I hate it. I want to do the things in my head, but it's almost like there is this invisible barrier of some kind preventing me from being that way. Feels like I am always in this bizarre twilight-ish state, where it's neither day nor night and nothing feels 'right'...

Also, I still get hit with a tad bit of fatigue (eventually) everyday, around afternoon time. Not unbearable, but still highly inconvenient and unwanted. It's almost like once that happens, it triggers some old thought/feeling in my head from the 'heavy usage' days. You know the ones...where you are constantly telling yourself you are a weak, incapable pile of garbage who is far too ill-equipped to finish the race in life successfully...and it just spirals from there. 

Sorry for the chunky post, I planned on posting a lot less lol. I will finish by saying many congrats to all who have quit and are in the process, and to those still on the fence...trust me, do it. Do it now. If you don't, you never will. It will never get easier. On the contrary, it will only get more difficult and burdensome in life. You don't need this garbage, you are FAR better than that. We were all created for a purpose and made unique and special. Kratom is a lie and a poison...

I'll do okay at tapering, then be trying to sleep and I am all of a sudden replaying traumatic events. Certain ones make me so angry that I feel I can't cope inside my own head without hitting something (or myself ;/ don't do that anymore but I used to). I used to drink myself to bed for this reason but I quit six months ago. My brain just goes round and round and I end up in a PTSD type spot where i'm reliving it and refeeling stuff and I feel I just want to implode. This is getting in the way of progress almost every time I try, or when i'm successful for a few weeks and then I have a bad day and just want to shut off the flashbacks so I just take a huge dose again and reverse to try and calm down.

Does anybody relate to this? In the past i've tapered okay, felt I know what I wanted, felt freer and ready to be vulnerable. But with some recent events, I feel totally different and stuck in a tension-brain of anger and memory loops and I don't know coping mechanisms for it. It's hard to be physically vulnerable when my mind is so stuck in the past. I can't afford therapy. What are other coping mechanisms for something like this? I really want to make progress and I keep trying, but I bail out like nope eventually because I just don't feel safe enough. Is there a place I can rant and people won't judge me, free therapy, or even simple ideas of things to do that will make me feel safer?",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988303780555725}"

Every day like clockwork I would take my 8:00am dose and go to work where I would need to take my second dose at 12:00pm. Third dose came at about 5:00pm on my drive home from work. This dose was supersized consisting of 25 capsules that I would dump into my cup holder and pick out like popcorn.

I started abusing Kratom when I was 23 so I could drown out the childhood traumas. As the years went on I would justify my worsening addiction by telling myself “look at what you have accomplished on Kratom.” I’m now 30 and during this time I met and married my wife, excelled in a marketing career to the point of receiving raises and promotions without asking, bought a house, and travelled extensively… All while maintaining this crippling addiction.

Looks can be deceiving. Nobody in my life knew about the addiction and internal suffering I experienced every day as a result of my use. I had to buy under shirts that absorb excessive sweat, I withdrew from friends and became a recluse, I only ate once a day to “maximize the high”, I lost my sex drive in a major way, I revolved my day around dosing, I dissociated every day, I faked being “normal”, I stopped talking to family, I lost motivation, I lost passion, I developed tremors, I would randomly stop breathing, I lost control of myself, and I lost all capability to experience emotions.

On December 23rd, 2021 my wife found a high top sock stuffed with 300 capsules of Kratom that I brought with me to get through our Christmas vacation. This was the best thing that could have happened to me. I had lied to my wife’s face countless times about using but she quickly switched from anger to support mode. I would have never been able to quit on my own no matter how much I wanted to.

My wife, my aunt, my psychiatrist, my addiction counselor, and this Reddit group have helped me tremendously over the last 8 days. Looking forward to taking my life back!

The worst withdrawal symptoms for me are RLS, insomnia, and physical back pain. For RLS it helps to take epsom salt baths, magnesium, and Gabapentin. My insomnia is linked to the RLS and is eased by the same things. For the physical pain Clonidine helps as well as yoga. No matter how you approach withdrawals it will suck.

The hardest part of not sleeping is struggling with the fact that I couldn't sleep. For me, I had to stop struggling and just accept it. I know, easier said than done. But it was a point that I ""got brought to"" rather than a decision I made, if that makes sense. Pain and suffering will do that. It's humbling. After a few days, acute WDs let up. I think, for me, PAWS and acutes kinda' began to bleed into each other at that point. Then, my toughest bout with PAWS was between 40-50 days, then again around 80 days but to a lesser extent. I never gave up. I refused to believe in the LIE my addict brain told me. There is no ""just this one time"" or ""just once in a while"" or ""I can control it this time"". Those thoughts (cravings) or all LIES. Don't believe the lies. I choose to replace the lies with the TRUTH, then take ACTION to ensure the LIE doesn't become a reality. Once practiced a few times, it becomes easier (maybe not easy, but easier). We have to **RETRAIN OUR BRAIN**. 

Fast forward to this year... Wife was in the hospital after another major surgery... Months later, thinking she had went missing after she started driving again (long story), and my brain convincing me she died in a car accident (which she didn't and is fine)... The loss of a beloved pet in November... And probably other things I'm just not remembering right now... Regardless, thankfully **I made it through all those things WITHOUT USING KRATOM**. You can too.

The best tools I've personally found are exercise and some type of breathing exercise or meditation. I prefer Wim Hoff Method breathing myself (Google or search on YouTube). 

Here's wishing everyone a Happy 2022. Hoping we can all make this quit our last. And as I always say, **QUIT AND STAY QUIT!**",20,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9931040406227112}"
2022-01-01 09:04:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/rtk1bf/1st_post_need_help/,1st post - need help,"Hey quitters,


Long time lurker and kratom abuser (5+ years, stable at 20GPD now) here. I’ve managed to quit a few times before, but they were usually in rehab from polysubstance abuse (I’ve spent way too much money for a few week-long suboxone/phenobarbital/ativan tapers).   I’ve had a lot of un/mistreated mental illness and codependent relationships growing up, that have painted the backdrop upon which this fucked up painting comes to life.  I know this is where the source of my healing must come from.  This time needs to be my last and final kick, lest I forgot this new bottom I’ve hit (I rang in the new year suffering outside alone sobbing in the fetal position watching fireworks explode, longing to return to the void, procrastinating the inevitable).  

I’m an addict, a liar, a manipulator, and a generally trash human when I have gone too far with kratom.  How have I gone too far?   

#1) hiding my use

#2) destroying my health 

#3) knowing better


Last night I faced the music and got honest with my loved one about it.  It was cathartic and nice for us to actually be really open, honest and vulnerable with each other for the first time in a while.  This just isn’t possible for me when I’m hiding my use and trying to get by on 2 extract shots a day to avoid withdrawal. 

I let girlfriend know that I’ve likely caused organ damage to my liver and kidneys and the reason I’ve been so irritable and disinterested in sex and the reason my hair is falling out (and the reason I’m missing $1000 each month).   My doctor is ordering labs for me next week and I told him everything too.  When I read the things I just typed I ask myself why the hell any woman would want to stay with me?

Well, i guess the reason is because there’s a small glimmer of humanity left in me.  The part of me that tells the truth, that is empathetic, the part that would die for my kids, the part that is still fighting to break free so I can experience the vision I have for the future.   A life free from kratom. A life where I feel my emotions and I don’t run from them.  A life of honesty regardless of the repercussions. 

I have serious adult responsibilities and commitments that affect many more people than myself, so I don’t have the luxury of going back to rehab for kratom (nor do I want to) or to CT withdraw.   I’m going to do a medically assisted, supervised taper with my doctor and just bite the bullet.      

Wish me luck and thanks for letting me get this out of my head.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9958415627479553}"

Had a breakdown the other day. Confessed to the wife about the ongoing kratom use and issues with gambling. She knew i was using kratom. I told her i stopped awhile back but i hid everything from her. She promptly decided to leave. So here i am on the couch bundled up with the heat cranked on and still shivering. All the classic symptoms. Even with helper meds. From a previous quit  i remember feeling drastically better physically  on days 4 or 5. Question. Isnt each time you quit progressively more difficult? The last time i quit wasnt this bad physically.,15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993903636932373}"

Just want to post what is working. I went to a doctor that works in detox and he is admitting more patients into in-patient detox for kratom WD because kratom WD is real. My 2 previous CT attempts were rough so I got help this time. I'm doing this at home alone with a non-narcotic drug taper prescribed by this detox doctor of gabapentin (large doses x 3 days then taper), baclofen, and clonidine and omg I virtually have no acutes and no rls at night and I'm sleeping since day 1 of CT. It's like the best for coming off kratom. He uses this for his in-patient detox kratom patients. We don't have to suffer through this, the medical community is getting skilled in how to help us. I bought an electric heating pad from cvs and I put it over my top sheet at night and lie on it and I did this when I CT before with no meds and it helps the night rls. It automatically turns off so I don't have to worry.

2022-01-01 02:50:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/rtekua/2_year_update/,2 year update,"I got a question about how I'm doing so I thought I should make a post.

I am normal now, and its great to not be dealing with the issues of dependency. I'm not sweating or restless and I can relax at night. I can enjoy the usual things in life that probably sound incredibly boring to you right now, if you're in the early stages. Trust me its worth it... and I did not have it as bad as some of you.

My particular journey came with the expected: PAWS, basically exactly as described by everyone - occasional bad days, decreasing in frequency slowly. Also a subtle reduced capability for handling stress... Stress just hits a bit harder. These things can be very challenging at times, but after 100 days or so I did not feel overwhelmed by it. It is manageable. I do still experience them, but its massively better and infrequent.

I had very little desire for hobbies too... for about a year. Eventually I started working on a personal project and it felt great to be excited about something productive and not substance related. Thats probably one of the more memorable parts of the recovery although its difficult to just make this happen. You have to discover something you havent done before that is exciting to you. Easier said than done, involves luck.

The journey also came with some unexpected issues:

1- A massive drop in libido. Maybe I should have anticipated this. It would be at zero for 30 days then spike for 1-2 days then zero again for another 30. There really is not any research on this subject either. The most I could find was 'it happens, and its not known when/if it recovers'. Its a little better recently, but I have been taking maca for a long time on and off to keep it at least above zero (dont take maca for the first 6 months because it can cause irritability and anger if you take too much, and your mood will be sensitive. Introduce it very slowly... Start at 0.5g).

2- Acne. Really bad acne. I think its called nodular acne but I didnt see a doctor. Nothing seems to work, also came in cycles like libido. 2 years to stop.

The other thing I've had trouble dealing with mentally is getting absolutely no credit from anyone for getting through this. Only my wife knows about it but she could not care less how hard it was (not that she could comprehend it). When I was going through WD and having bad days, it would often only make her mad that I wasn't feeling good (her mood is really dependent on mine). Man, did that just make it harder - but again she could not give a shit. And now that I am through it, the attitude is 'you get no credit'. Literally she has said this (I guess I can understand to a degree).

I think the lesson here is to find the strength within yourself to do it, and be proud of yourself for doing it. You can do support groups... but in the long run you have to be able to face challenges yourself as they show up, because someone's not always going to be there for you. It sounds a bit cynical but I think its true. Now that I got through it, I feel a lot of confidence in myself and know that I can probably handle most things in life.

Good luck everyone and hold on.",17,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.7259604334831238}"

Starting fresh for 2022","My last post, I was ready to quit over Thanksgiving, however life had other plans...a family member had a seizure because of what turned out to be a brain tumor along (he survived surgery to remove it but is and beginning treatment for stage for 4 cancer). Long story short it was a stressful time and I delayed my quit. The last two years have been shit, being laid off, a bad car accident, a parent with cancer, and now a sibling with cancer, and covid on top of all of this. I know that there are much worse things, I am still very lucky and privileged in life, and not succeeding in the past or trying to quit is all on me, that there is never a good time, and I should have just jumped regardless. But I have this week off, and now I am determined. I have helper meds, a long Netflix queue (WITCHER S2!!! (no spoilers!))...LDN for day 7, and a positive mindset. I'm tired of this cycle, and this time I HAVE to succeed, for my career, my relationship, and myself. I miss real joy, real euphoria (and my sex life).  I just flushed the last of all my capsules. I have an rx for suboxone but I am super hesitant to even touch it. I believe I can do it this time. Thank you to all in this group, it is such a huge source of support and inspiration!

I know this is more for recovery help but I’m hoping to find an experienced sober individual who’s used suboxone and agmatine to help them stay clean. 
I wanted to know specifically if agmatine helped them and if I’m taking both at the same time am I making the suboxone not work as well? Just curious if anyone knows.
