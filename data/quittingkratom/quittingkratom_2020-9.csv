I have quit heavy opioid addiction three times, as well as other substances. 4 years ago, I got clean to have my daughter. Luckily all I had to quit was meth at that time- I had managed to use the meth to distract myself from using opiods for two years. After she was born, I got on kratom almost immediately. I started with about 10-15 grams a day and then about to 2 years ago I switched to OPMS gold capsules- which I had been taking about 8 capsules on a good day to get by. 

I am in HELL right now. Not as bad as a methadone detox, but very similar to all the other options.

2020-09-29 13:41:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/j246bw/4_years_without_kratom/,4 years without kratom,"Hey ya’ll. Today marks my 4th year of sobriety from kratom. 

I used to be a moderator on this site under the name Yoghity, but Reddit decided to delete my account for some reason, so I am using my back-up account. (Sorry mods. I stopped using Reddit for awhile after finding this out.) 

These have been a long and difficult 4 years, but that’s not to say there wasn’t good in them. If you are part of this subreddit, or thinking about joining this community, I’m very proud of you for seeking help for your problem with kratom, even if you’re not completely committed to quitting. 

For reference of where I was 4 years ago, I had been using for 2 1/2 years, and nearly the last full year, I was using kratom daily. I was unemployed and living with my mother. My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me for lying about quitting kratom. We had several other problems, but I believe that was the last straw. This day 4 years ago was the day she broke up with me for the last time, and I decided to go to my first NA meeting. I was a depressed mess. 

My life now is completely different. I have a salary and I have a family with my wonderful fiancé and her two kids. We live in a house we rent, but are planning on buying a house within a year. I’ve never felt such stability or love, and I attribute most of my success in life to quitting kratom. 

A year ago, a friend, who I had grown up with, died of a fentanyl overdose. He was the one who got me into kratom. I cut him out of my life a year prior to his death because he had turned into a monster, and apparently was in and out of rehab with his wife. Although I don’t truly believe that I would have turned to harder substances because I didn’t have the kinds of problems my friend had, he is a living/dying example of where my life could have led if I hadn’t decided to change. 

My reason for posting this is twofold: I wanted to check in with the community that I had my start with, and I wanted to drop some knowledge bombs based on personal experience on those of you who are struggling (I’m sure a lot of this advice has been repeated by many on this subreddit). 

1. You will quit many times before it actually sticks. You won’t really stop until you come to the realization that kratom stands in the way of your happiness/being a functional, responsible person/insert a third thing here, and that the only way to achieve your goal will require you to first remove kratom from your life. 

2. Some people do better quitting cold turkey while others do better with tapering. If you can’t taper without rationalizing using more, you need to just bite the bullet. I tried tapering many times and the only time it was effective was when my mom was giving me my doses, but that time didn’t stick. 

3. Each time you quit, withdrawal symptoms get worse. I don’t know if that’s true for if you were to relapse after a long time of recovery, but I’m too afraid to find out. 

4. Helpers are your friends. Black seed oil saved me through the worst of my withdrawals. I can’t even imagine facing my worst symptoms without BSO. I also highly recommend CBD even for general anxiety. I know some contributors on here have praised other helpers like magnesium and ashwaghanda. Sleeping is important in your recovery, so make sure you take the appropriate helpers before bed. 

5. There’s never a good time to quit. If you are like me, and keep telling yourself that you’ll stop tomorrow, but you keep telling yourself that so tomorrow never comes, it’s likely that you are afraid of dealing with the withdrawals or afraid of never feeling the pleasant buzz of kratom again. Maybe you rationalize continuing to use because it’s the only way you know how to cope with work. The cold reality is that life is hard and that you will need to learn how to cope on life’s own terms. 

6. Recovery is a lot like you are a hollow shell, but slowly becoming a real person again. You have likely been using kratom long enough to the point where whenever you’ve felt much of any feeling, you’ve used kratom to dull your emotions, so quitting kratom will mean having to confront and deal with your emotions again instead of letting yourself be sedated to pass through life. The more you recover, the more you will rediscover who you are as a person, and I think you might be pleasantly surprised with the results. You will eventually feel normal again and no longer feel horrible without kratom. Withdrawal sucks and the time dilation you may experience will likely make your first week feel like two weeks. PAWS also sucks, but is still manageable.

7. See a doctor if you can. If you have healthcare and can afford it, get a physical. If not, perhaps there is a local program that can give you a physical for free or on a sliding scale based on income (for this you might have to do some research). With all of the emotions that you will be feelings, hopefully this can help give you peace of mind. Tell the doctor about your substance use disorder. They may prescribe you with something to help with your anxiety and sleep that is non-habit forming. They might also be able to recommend something for counseling. 

8. Tell people close to you about your problem with kratom. I’ve heard many people with substance use disorder say “I got myself into this mess, so it’s up to me to get myself out,” which makes no sense since you are the one who is having trouble with yourself. The people whom I had notice struggling the most on this subreddit are people that refused to be open with their friends and family, and if you aren’t being transparent with people, you can’t have accountability. Accountability helps give our lives the structure we need. Without it, we are in a figurative free-fall. Creating a personal support group among your friends and family is an excellent way to cope and get through this. You may find that your strongest cravings occur when you are feeling strong negative emotions, and you may also find that talking out those feelings can make those cravings go away. 

9. Find a group to be a part of. This subreddit is great and all, but what it sorely lacks is the accountability that you need. It’s too easy to feel anonymous online, but being physically present, or perhaps part of regular Zoom calls with groups, helps with the structure I mentioned in the previous tip. Being part of a community does wonders to the psyche, and it doesn’t even have to be a community centered around addiction for you to reap the benefits. Just Google “rat park” and check that out. I believe I heard that there are NA and AA group meetings on Zoom in the Time of Corona. Even if you find you don’t like one NA meeting, I encourage you to try a different NA meeting because they aren’t all the same. If you don’t like the religious aspects of those groups, I encourage you to either think of the “higher power” as the group since it is larger than you alone, or look for an outpatient program, if you have the means. Even if you don’t have insurance, government grants exist to help fund your treatment, so that might be worth taking a look. Personally, I went to a few NA meetings despite being atheist, and I liked them, but I did an outpatient program through my clinic, and that was similar, but the therapist knew how to run the meetings much more effectively. 

10. Get counseling. Between gathering together a personal support group, and finding a group to attend and feel a part of, this may sound like overkill, but hear me out. Your recovery is important, so it only makes sense that you get as much attention and validation as you can get. With addiction, there is almost always an underlying disorder that the addiction is treating and masking. For me, it’s my depression. For my friend who died, it was his narcissistic personality disorder. If these problems had been treated (I don’t think there’s actually treatment for NPD), we may not have developed addictions. This is where a therapist comes in. If you choose to get a therapist, make sure you feel comfortable with who you pick. You are wasting your therapist’s and your own time if you don’t feel like you can open up to them and work on your problems. There are apps like Better Help and Talkspace that are affordable alternatives at the comfort of your own home. I’ve tried Better Help, and I was really impressed by it. Depending on why you need a counselor, they can match you with someone who specializes with your problems, and many are certified drug counselors. 

11. Find a hobby or two. Hobbies are wonderful things that can help occupy your time, give you a sense of accomplishment, and they can help regulate your moods. They are also great for helping keep sane during Quarantine. Playing video games and watching movies or shows are fun, but that’s not exactly what I’m talking about, though I do love doing those things. As you grow to become a real person again, you may discover new things you like to do as well. Hobbies may be able to help with the time dilation from acute withdrawal, and hopefully help get your mind off of the withdrawal. Especially during PAWS, it’s good to feel a sense of accomplishment, and that feeling can help motivate you to get that dopamine rush again from a healthy source. Hobbies can help regulate your mood by taking your focus off of the cause of your mood, which can help you compartmentalize the situation you’ve experienced. One of my hobbies that I’ve discovered is woodworking. Having to be a parent to my fiancé’s kids is stressful, especially after a long day at work, so I try to work on projects during the days we have them. So far, I’ve built a pull-out spice rack on wheels out of recycled wooden pallets and a bed with storage underneath. Now, I’m working on an arbor for my wedding. Another hobby of mine is making jokes on Twitter. You can find me at this link https://twitter.com/imnicholasaurus/status/939159494269030401?s=21 Humor and laughter are important during recovery, so I’d love it if you were to subscribe and let my dumb jokes give you dopamine rushes. 

12. Learn to be a little selfish. Your recovery should be one of your top priorities, so if something threatens that, you need to protect yourself. When I talk about being selfish, I’m not giving you the go ahead to do whatever you want. What I’m talking about is taking care of yourself before you try to please someone else. Apply your own oxygen mask before helping others. You might be a parent that needs to take a little break before attending to your kid(s). You might have people in your life demanding things from you that aren’t your responsibility. Whatever is stressing you out, you need to look after yourself, because you won’t always have someone watching out for you. When my friend died, I didn’t go to his funeral because I knew the kind of people he surrounded himself with, and I was too afraid being around them would lead me to relapse. Even years later, I needed to prioritize my mental health rather than go to a funeral to support other people. 

Recovery from kratom was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever done. I hope that my tips can help you with a successful recovery. You absolutely can make it to the other side and life can get better.",133,"{'rona': 1, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4763846}"

thankfully i’m not hurt or anything. i woke up with a killer headache and my teeth hurt from clenching my jaw while it was happening. i’m done taking kratom forever now. that was incredibly scary especially because i was alone while it was happening. 

my main symptoms today are cold chills and depression. pretty gnarly headache too. i’m quite sleepy.

I've got two major exams this week (one in a few hours) and a busy work schedule. I have basically no energy and it feels as if my bones all weigh twice as much as usual, but I'm in too deep now and I'm beyond ready to be with this stuff again. It took me over an hour to get out of bed this morning. I can't help but laugh at how shitty I feel knowing that I put myself in this position.  


I'm also having a hard time eating because everytime I do I get a major spike in anxiety for whatever reason, so I've basically just accepted I'm going to be in a caloric deficit for a bit this week.  


On the bright side, the weather is beautiful and has cooled down significantly (I'm in the deep south). Only a few more days and this shit will be over, and then I can go back to my normal high-functioning self instead of losing literally hours everyday because I decided I needed to take some kratom to feel good, only to be consistently disappointed when I'm instead greeted with 20 minutes of excitement followed by light headedness, losing about half of my IQ points, and a flurry of negative emotions that basically turn me into a different person.

Over the weekend I took more kratom than my taper schedule allowed. It was too much for me. I got that hot but cold feeling, extreme sweats and nausea that eventually led to me vomiting up nothing but kratom. I sat on the bathroom floor ashamed. My twin daughters know I’m tapering and they are all too familiar with me throwing my guts up from taking too much. They are almost 20 and still living at home while in college and they are my biggest cheerleaders. One was like “you did it again didn’t you?”...she knew I’d fell off my taper but instead of beating me up she made me some soup, got me a cold rag and made me a comfy spot on the couch. This set back was embarrassing and motivating at the same time. Since that ugly gross experience I’ve dropped my early morning dose. I felt like I had to make up for my setbacks. Granted I’ve only gone without the morning dose for 3 days but 3 days is a longtime I’m the kratom world. I’ve made a point to stay up later so that I sleep later and have totally changed up my morning routine. Instead of waking up and getting coffee and taking Kratom, I’ve been sleeping in, having just one cup of coffee, a hot shower and a healthy breakfast and have been able to wait until at least 9:30 to dose. I guess my main point is, it’s okay if you slip up. But don’t just say F it and go back to where you’re were before tapering. Get back on the horse and keep riding this ride into the sunset. I wish this was easier to quit but it’s not for many of us. So some days we aren’t going to be perfect but it doesn’t mean we’ve failed. We just have to put those bad days behind us and keep going. I’m down from 60gpd to 32 and to me that’s a huge victory. I just want to and have to be as transparent as possible because so many of us have not so good days but guess what, it’s perfectly okay and so normal. I think it’s important to share our “failures” too. There are many positive and helpful posts but we must be honest with ourselves and others and share our hiccups.

For those of you who didn't see my posts:
I had my first ever tonic-clonic(grand mal) seizure on Wednesday that was triggered by an absurdly high dose I took that morning (15g strong green Malay in one go).

I was heavily addicted to kratom and was fighting with it for years now. Tried to quit 3 times only to fail hard and up my dosage each time I relapsed. 

This run I was using about 40gpd for almost a year straight. It was the first thing I did when I woke up in the morning and the last thing before I went to sleep.
 
My physical health declined rapidly this last year as I wasn't eating much at all (like starving myself just so I could feel the effects) and was always dehydrated. My hands were almost constantly shaking, I felt dizzy and lost a ton of weight. 

Mentally I felt nothing but numbness, anger and sadness. 

And nobody in my life knew I was on it 24/7. 


Now I am clean since Wednesday and am dedicated to never take that stuff again.

I'd use for a week or two, run out and quit for a week experiencing little more than lethargy. Fast forward to December 2019 - I find a local tobacco shop selling quality kratom and that's all she wrote - I've been daily at 30-45gpd since. 

So I'm ten months into a 30-45gpd habit and my life revolves entirely around kratom. I'm already a shell of the person I once was and I've forgotten how I once felt before I began using.  I have also noticed both cognitive decline relating to my studies in combination with a distinct lack of drive to even bother with them at all. My grades are suffering, my work is barely getting done and I'm exhausted to a point I've never felt and shouldn't feel at my age.

I managed to go twenty-four hours without Kratom today; I dosed at 6pm last night and didn't dose again until 6:02pm this evening - I convinced myself to dose as I have work in the morning and there's no way I would be in any condition to go after a night of withdrawal. 

I relate to not feeling yourself - this stuff completely numbs who you are as a person, all emotion a drive to connect with humans disappears. Even during sober time such as today, I begin to feel much, much better as a human. I would like to get off Kratom entirely for forever, soon. I plan to take a few weeks off from work while getting as far ahead as possible with my studies before a cold turkey quit.

I've been lurking on this sub since February, around the three month of usage mark and when I first became concerned with my usage. Tonight, I've finally decided to post my troubles and reach out for you all for support moving forward. I hope to be completely clean and sober by the holidays so I may enjoy time with my family without being completely numb, exhausted and uninitiated.

I figure this... if i can push the amount of time between re-doses (yesterday I got to 12 hours ugh) and get used to the uncomfortability of all this and possibly get my tolerance down in the mean time (NO ABUSE AND NO USING FOR A BUZZ JUST THE BARE MINIMUM TO FUNCTION) then I'll be better equipped when I quit. 

Also I think I need at LEAST another week with being off suboxone as when I quit suboxone before I was sick for 3 months. (First 2 weeks were hell) If I quit the kratom too fast im going to be feeling the repercussions of kratom withdrawal and suboxone withdrawal which is, initially what my body is going through hell from.

*But how long does the kratom withdrawal itself last in comparison to suboxone? I mean the physical shit. How long is safe to stay on kratom? Is it possible I can just ween off slowly with no sickness?* I feel its important to note that I weaned down to 0.25mgPD of suboxone over the period of about a month annnd started drinking kratom then. Mostly daily but not 3-4x per day. Its really only the last 2 weeks that I've began drinking multiple, or at least more than 2-3 doses per day.

Thanks for your help. My important questions are *wrapped in asterisks*. And to give you an idea of where I am, I'd say I use about 4-6 cups a day with 2 heaping tablespoons. I dont weigh, should probably start, but this seems like an ounce a day (or 5-10 grams per dose) once I find out how much im using ill have a base line and an idea of where to skip doses....

How does all of this sound? Should I just cold turkey or does it sound like I have a chance? I know I can do this, ive had multiple years clean twice from opiates in NA I'm just so frustrated I want to be clean NOW.

Thanks.

Edit: im strongly considering getting some gabapentin off the onion as i know it works wonders for opiate withdrawal (for me) but the problem is I get pop-up drug tests once per month for probation and they test for EVERYTHING... and gabapentin is a scheduled substance here. I do have a leftover prescription for clonidine and hydroxyzine but they are so mild in comparison

Im thinking of weaning down till me next drug test and hopefully after the next one I'll have a good 2 weeks at least where I can just detox at home and make myself comfortable. Ugh i wish I wasn't on probation.

Edit again:
So a heaping tablespoon is about 2.5-3 grams for me

And ill be dosing at around 4.5 mg tonight. Hopefully for the last time.

I've got a feeling I never dose much more than 6g at a time to get well. Especially because I gag at the texture and taste. Anything 5g is definately me abusing and definately reaching for something I'd say.

Well its day 21. It's also a Monday which are the worst days of the week for me. Glad to say this one hasn't been to bad.

I have not taken any kratom since 9/7. I think the turning point was Day 16 for me. I had some sense of normalcy again though my sleep isn't perfect yet. 

Noopept has been a great help taken sublingually at 15 mg to give me some stimulation. I only allow myself every other day for it.  The brain fog is getting less but it is definitely still there. I believe that is just how it will be for a few months. Also, I've been steadily lowering my caffeine intake which feels good to know.

WARNING do not attempt unless you know what you are doing....

The other thing that helped was microdosing. On day 17 I felt safe enough in my schedule and where I was mentally/physically without Kratom to take a 10 ug dose of liquid LSD that I've have dosed at 2.5 a drop. 

What I can say is it did work. It was the happiest easiest day I've had all since stopping Kratom. Also this dose is above my usual 7.5 ug that I would normally take from time to time. Micros were maybe a once a  month thing for me. The reason being is I just found it easier to take Kratom all the time instead of microdosing. But this dose was higher then my normal for a reason. Through many trial and errors I know how I feel on 7.5 vs 10. The higher dose is just a little too much that it's noticeably not in the background as a microdose should be. The whole point of microdosing is to not feel high or overly stimulated. 

I mention this because I was not overly stimulated. This micro was in the background. So much so I forgot I had taken as my work day went on. When it was time to go home from work I realized how happy and productive the day went without feeling ""too beautiful"" which means to high of a dose. 

This makes me believe that Kratom and/or the withdrawal means my brain is not fully back to a normal state. Which is to be expected. I'll be waiting at least one whole week to micro again. Since last thursday when I took it, the days would all be considered good in my book. Mood has been up. The only thing that is annoying is sleep is still not perfect. I can sleep for four hours, wake up, bathroom, then toss and turn till alarm goes off. I imagine I'll get over this hump soon and then the energy will start returning a bit more naturally for me.

This is the Point of this post. I’ve let the work pile up. I have zero motivation to do it. What’s worse is have this feeling of dread that THIS is what life is going to be like. Kratom gave me that false sense of focus and energy. I’m not going back to it, but still, there’s that lingering question of what life will he like without it. Will I just be lazy? Will I be a fat mess? I see people post about feeling better then they have in years and I’m really curious what that even means. What does normal feel like? Life on life’s terms is a son of bitch and after Kratom is gone completely I won’t have it to help cope. I don’t drink or do any kind of drug whatsoever so it will be daunting. Ugh I need to stay in the day, just typing this shit is making my anxious.

Helping others, when possible, on this sub to quit is obviously part of me staying quit.

I have my up and down days / moments physically and mentally. Vastly more ups than downs. Daily back and hip pain is still present but has improved tremendously. My attitude has improved and is positive 95% of the time if I had to make a rough estimate. I'm getting more physical activity than I have in years (even before kratom) and most of the time I no longer have to force myself to do it. It's gone from ""need to""... to ""have to""... to ""want to""... to ""love to"" over the course of 3+ months. 

I wouldn't even say sleep is an issue any more. I average around 5 - 6 hours a night. Sometimes more, sometime less. Getting to sleep is soooo much easier now. I'm usually drifting off between 10 - 11pm. If I wake at 4am, I'm totally cool with that. I now enjoy waking up when it's still dark outside.

Cravings? None. Random thoughts? Occasionally. As I've said here multiple times, those thoughts are LIES my addict brain tells me. I dispel those lies immediately, replace them with the TRUTH and then either attempt to help someone or just be productive. I have control over my thoughts. My thoughts don't control me. If I romanticize those thoughts... those lies... that's when they can eventually lead to ""cravings"". If I'm serious about STAYING QUIT, why would I take that chance? Nip those lies in the bud! I want kratom to remain out of my life FOR EVER. 

I've long since gotten rid of any left-over stash. I've unsubscribed from vendor email lists. And I've unsub'd from pro-kratom subreddits. Why would I even want to browse there? Why would I care about what they're saying? Who cares! My primary purpose is simple: Staying quit and helping others who want to quit.

I went for an extract to really experience it, and now here I am slightly addicted to extracts. Moved up in dosage from once to twice a week, to every other day, to now every day except the weekends, where I spend my free time in withdrawal. Also moved up from one shot to two each time I dose. The withdrawal isn't as bad as I expected, but i've only made it around 4 days into it. And I should mention (I know it's frowned upon, but it's for accuracy regarding this post) it's the OPMs shots. The thing that is making me nervous is when I would dose with these, I would feel it for a lot longer than any other kind (8-10 hours, vs 2-3 hours for other kinds) and the typical withdrawal symptoms wouldn't hit until at least 24 hours later after it wore off.   


Now, I know from experience with suboxone that long activity in the body = longer withdrawal that has a delayed peak. In my 2-4 days of staying away from it each time before having to go back to work and  stupidly resuming taking it, I noticed it doesn't really seem to be getting worse. On day 4 it feels like I might be getting close to being over the hump. But the thing that gives me extreme anxiety each time is remembering my suboxone quit, where I thought I was fine at day 4, and it didn't peak until day 9 or so. This thought keeps freaking me out and sending me back. I was wondering if anyone has successfully quit this stuff and can tell me what the timespan was. I'm on day 4 right now and I don't feel that bad to be honest, and I have the next 3 days off as well. I'm hoping I have the time to at least get to a point where I can function at work. I actually don't feel that bad at all right now, probably because last week I made it 4 days, took it daily for 4 days, and am now 4 days clean again. Right now I just feel kind of mildly depressed, legs uncomfortable, and runny eyes. Stomach isn't even bothering me.

Im a 40 year old woman, I have cirrhosis but good liver levels due to exercise, good diet, and no alcohol. (just some genetic high lipids.)

Was doing a kinda-vague amount of k everyday, maybe 5 or 6 doses a day for around 4 years with this plastic scoop that one of my vendors sent, which I guessed was around 1/2 or more teaspoon. I was totaling around 20-30 g a day. After feeling really shitty the last few months (basically the complete opposite of what the kratom initially did for me for the first two years- depression, fatigue, helplessness, hopelessness, zero sex drive, irritability, anger, not suicidal but not caring if i died, other stuff. Ive always had depression and it was back.) Basically i started to realize every morning, “Damn I really am tired of kratom, it sucks now.” i started reading here about how tapers dont have to be hell. 8 years ago, got off dope with subs, then off the subs with k. So i am not stranger to WD and a major wuss now. Long story short, I seriously dropped my dose for last 8 days. My trick? I bought MINI measuring spoons. Like 1/4, 1/8, and 1/16th teaspoon set from Amazon. I know everyone says use a scale but i havent yet. So I am now at total of 4.75 g/day, spaced out in 6 small (3/8th tsp, six tiny 1/16th scoops) doses every 3 hours. Im definitely not sick, sneezy and achey a bit more, but I taste things again, starting to feel emotions. I know my difficulties are ahead but this initially has been very encouraging. I am not tempted to take more BECAUSE i know more than that 1/4 teaspoon makes me feel numb, irritable, and edgy and i hate that. I also have a small arsenal of supplements recommended by this sites taper guide. I exercise a lot, bike, yoga, run a mile in the morning. Eating more.

Thanks guys. Will check in when i start to actually feel WDS. Unlike many posters who are quitting and now vehemently hate kratom, i dont. I KNOW i ran that ride deep into the ground by overindulgence and daily use. So, i ruined it for myself. I truly do feel it has a great part of a balanced lifestyle... because for my first few years of k, because i have an addictive personality, depression and anxiety, I KNOW i tend to seek out destructive substances to numb. Ive always been like that. But when i had a regular small bit of k in my routine, it quieted those urges. So... for me maybe one day it can be a maintenance herb but for now i am trying to give my brain a chance to heal and learn how to feel again.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.42445487}"

You may have seen me posting on here thinking I was going to die, as I had such intense anxiety that it would send me through panic attacks throughout the day. I would cry myself to sleep almost every night because I was so scared of going to bed and it was really difficult to relax enough to even lay down.

I’ve gone through withdrawals before with other substances, but I used K the longest and it truly showed. I really didn’t think I would get better.

I went to the doc and he satiated my fears that I was dying. He did my blood work and assured me I was a healthy young lad, and after the three long, agonizing months I finally feel normal again. It feels so fucking amazing, words can’t describe.

The sleep problems and brain fog recently resolved. I didn’t think I was ever going to get a clear head again. I think the reason why I experienced withdrawal so badly was because I used K as a crutch for my severe anxiety I already had, and when I stopped suddenly the trauma and anxiety I had suppressed all came instantly and put me through the worst loop I have ever experienced.

My friends, you can do this. I didn’t think this was going to be possible, I thought my anxiety was actually going to kill me in the first few weeks.

\-2nd week: ""pink cloud"" situation (with lingering muscle aches, insomnia and exhaustion)

\-3rd week: PAWS and crazy insomnia

When I halved my dose for a week I had some moderate depression, I talked to my wife about it and she really shed some light on the whole depression thing.

It’s funny because that seems so obvious but at the time it wasn’t.

2020-09-26 19:42:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/j0ght7/using_memantine_to_taperquit_kratom/,Using Memantine To Taper/Quit Kratom,"Hello everyone👋I wanted to share my success with using Memantine to taper Kratom (and eventually quit). 

A little background to start. I abused various substances over the years with several years of being clean in between each bought. I started taking Kratom for pain to get off opioids (which I started due to several legit chronic pain issues) that I eventually started abusing. 

I started Kratom at 7 grams a dose every 3 or 4 hours due to my high tolerance to opioids. I was prescribed 10mg percocet 4x a day plus 20 mg a day of methadone. The methadone wasn't an attempt to get me off the percs, they were prescribed in addition because of my tolerance. They didn't want to increase my perc dosage so at first they added a Buprenorphine  pain patch. I was on that for several months when I suddenly developed an allergic reaction to whatever was in the adhesive. For that reason they took me off and added methadone. 

 As I said, I eventually started abusing them...both the percs and methadone. Oddly enough, I actually enjoyed the methadone more than the percs but that may have been due to legit pain. Methadone, at least for me,  had a better analgesic effect. Whether it was due to tolerance of the percs or actual efficacy of the methadone, I'm not sure. 

Anyway, I'm not sure of my actual daily dosage of the two but in the end, a 30 day supply of both never lasted more than 5 days. For that reason I was always having to suffer through  withdrawals every month. Then I found Kratom! It took away the withdrawals and helped my pain so I decided I wanted off the prescription opioids. 

I quit the rx's completely and was taking 7, sometimes 8 grams a dosage every 3 to 4 hours for the last 3 years. That usually amounted to somewhere around 45 to 50 grams a day.  I never really increased my dosage because the few times I tried, I didn't receive any extra benefits. It just gave me the wobbles and made me nauseous so I stuck with the original dosage. 

I have a steady supply and I always buy in bulk, usually 2kilos at a time so I never run out and never had to face withdrawals. EXCEPT, while trying to sleep. I was waking up at least once a night having to dose. In the mornings, I would always dose the powder 15 to 20 minutes before being able to get out of bed and get ready for work. 

I really don't get anything out of Kratom other than pain relief whereas I used to get a decent mood boost and some anxiety relief in the beginning. That was a huge bonus for me as I suffer from depression, anxiety, panic attacks and agoraphobia. Unfortunately that mood boost was very short lived and eventually I developed anhedonia on top of everything thing else. (I'm not saying the anhedonia was caused by Kratom, there were many factors involved) For that reason I also added Phenibut.( Now I know this is a quitting Kratom sub, not quitting Phenibut but I feel it's relevant and worth mentioning  in the interest of full disclosure. )

The Phenibut was great at first but being prone to addiction, it wasn't long before I was abusing it. It lost its magic quickly and after chasing that initial mood boost and anxiety relief, my dosages quickly sky rocketed and I found myself dosing 4 to 5 grams a day just to avoid withdrawal. 

Well fast forward to a couple of months ago. I decided I didn't want to be a slave to either of these substances anymore. Like I said, I get no added benefits from Kratom other than some (not total) pain relief and I feel like I can get that from high dosage cbd. As for the Phenibut, I get absolutely nothing from other than it staving off withdrawal so I wanted off it too. 

I started trying to titrate down but it wasn't going so great. I would usually end up saying f**k it and take my usual dosage again after a few days in. Then I'd start over and it always ended up to me going back up to the 7 or 8 grams. However, a couple of months ago, I started taking memantine in theraputic dosages as I heard it could be used off label to treat treatment resistant depression and anhedonia as well as anxiety. This is when I realized it was allowing me to subconsciously dose less frequently on the Kratom. Like I would forget to dose. Usually I was counting down the hours and minutes until my next dosage but on the memantine it was an afterthought. 

Memantine is an nmda agonist mostly prescribed for alzheimer disease but has gained popularity in the nootropic community as a smart drug. It's also prescribed off label for depression and anxiety as I've already mentioned but has also been used by some to reduce tolerance to various substances. Therefore it made sense that it had that effect on me.

Sooo, I did a little more research and found that a lot of people here on reddit have actually used it for tapering various meds. With that knowledge, I started knocking off a gram from each Kratom dosage just about every day.  I was also waiting AT LEAST 4 hours between dosing where before it was 3 or 4. After a week I was waiting 5 hours between dosages and down to 3 grams 4 times a day! The best part is that I really didn't suffer from any noteworthy withdrawal symptoms. 

I was also tapering my Phenibut by 100mg a day so I really expected to feel a lot more discomfort but thanks to the memantine I didn't. 

I felt that 3 gram a dose (12 grams a day) was  reasonable  so I kind of stuck with that for almost a month. In the meantime, I continued my Phenibut tapering and rapidly got down to 1 gram a day where I also also hovered for awhile. 

After staying at a gram for a few weeks, I begin tapering my Phenibut further beginning a couple of weeks ago and I'm now down to 500 mg. Im doing a much slower taper now that I'm down to this dosage. Once I got to 800mg, I was taking 50mg every other day. Now I'll only be dropping around 25mg every other  day because I've found the lower your dosage gets, the more you'll start to feel the discomfort if you taper too fast ( regardless of any helper meds)

Now back to the Kratom. I decided to start tapering on that again as well a couple of days ago. As with the Phenibut, once you've gotten to the  lower range of dosing, it's best to go slower. I've been taking a few mg of every other day and I've gotten down to 2 grams 3 times a day. I can even sleep through the night without waking up in withdrawals. I do wake up for other reasons but I don't need to dose. I simply take my last 2 gram dosage at 8pm and it holds me over until I have to wake up for work at 5.

Today, though, no work so I slept until 7am after being up until 3am. I let my dogs out, fed them and my cats and went back to sleep without feeling the need to dose! I woke up around 10 am and although I wasn't desperate to dose due to withdrawal symptoms, I did for pain purposes. 

I've been at this dosage for 2 days. I'll probably stick with it another couple days then continue to taper. I honestly don't think I could have done it this quickly with so little withdrawal without the memantine. 

I also take cbd as needed as well as several vitamins and supplements I've been on for the last year. Those include, NAC, methylated b vitamins, vitamin d, magnesium, l-theanine and taurine.  Although I do feel like those are also helpful when tapering, I fully attribute my success thus far mostly to the memantine.  

I also use a little thc (no more than one hit) a couple times a week along side the cbd.  I have gastroparesis and get extreme nausea and will vomit uncontrollably for days at a time without it. I don't feel the small infrequent dosages have any bearing on my ease of tapering though. It's just worth mentioning so you have all the facts. 

Good luck to all those trying to quit and congratulations to all those who have already succeeded. I just wanted to share my experience with memantine and tapering because it's been so helpful.

The doctor ended up telling me that not only were both of my ears full of huge amounts of obstructed earwax, but my right ear canal was infected and inflamed. They had to irrigate both of my ears with water to remove the trapped wax, and having this procedure done on the infected ear was almost excruciating. I was in a lot of pain for the rest of the day, which is why this post is late, but I ended up coping with it really well (I was also prescribed anti-inflammatory/antibiotic ear drops that have really helped me). I think that kratom is ultimately what caused the earwax obstructions; abusing kratom can lead to some pretty serious dehydration, and dehydration can thicken your earwax significantly. It turns out that my blood pressure is also a lot higher than it normally is, probably because 1) kratom WD is stressful for the body and 2) kratom lowers your blood pressure. It's crazy just how many ways the green sludge can stealthily and insidiously mess with your health. 

I don't have too many complaints today (day 6). I'm still sweating more than I should be, but I managed to sleep 8 hours last night (by some miracle!). I have some pretty shitty mental symptoms—anxiety, emotional instability, frequent threat of tears, sluggishness—but I'm managing. I am trying to be as pro-active as possible by taking care of my physical health for the sake of my mental health. One thing I'm pretty pleased about is that I can eat whenever I want now. When I was on the sludge, I skipped breakfast every day so that I could dose as soon as I crawled out of bed (and wouldn't even eat afterward because I didn't want to 'diminish' the effects). Most days I was only eating one large meal; now I can have three. Kratom actually made me lose a lot of weight when I was using it, and I really couldn't afford that because I was only 115 lbs. to begin with. I look forward to hopefully gaining some weight back.",6,{'infect': 4},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49247056}"

Honestly, today feels worse than yesterday. Got about 45min of sleep last night and maybe another 25min this morning. The lack of sleep is crushing, but I’ll take what I can get at this time. I know that this is only temporary. 

Honestly can’t say that I’ve had any serious cravings as of yet. The anger towards this substance & my personal decline is a huge motivational factor. Yet.. I know these will come. This attempt feels different than past quits, but each usually does. Depending upon where we are at that point in time. I’ll also add, this one is significantly worse acute wise. Of course, I only have myself to blame. After each quit I’d revert back to using daily and upping my dosage. Horrible decision. 

I’ve also noticed that I am insanely angry today. Mad at the entire world and will blow up at the slightest thing. I can check this symptom off the list. There’s that anger that was discussed in the “what to expect” segment. With each quit I’ll  circle back and cruise through those writings as if somethings different within there. Like an updated timeline has been added or new information has surfaced. As always, nothing’s changed. I know what I’m in for.. and it’s usually just extended with the increased dosage/ timeframe. 

These past 4 days have been brutal to say the least. Really need to pick myself up off the bed/ couch and get moving, even if just slightly. I’ve promised myself that this will happen this evening. No matter what.. 30 minutes of movement will happen. Days 1-3 .. there was just no way I could physically do this. I’ll take this as a good sign that I can now force myself to pick up and move.

A feeling of “pride” is something I haven’t felt in years, so forgive me. I’ll begin by saying I’m absolutely giving this decease of addiction to Kratom a truck load of respect and caution. 

Yesterday was the first day in YEARS that I didn’t take an extract. An extract that I’ve been spending $60-$80 A DAY on for the past 3 years. An extract that, in order to buy and maintain my habit, I would hide and stash money away from my family (wife and children) for years. Money that could have been used to better the life of my family. (Note: I had to pause after typing that last sentence to take in the enormity of that last statement. The feeling of guilt and shame. The enormous sense of self centered-ness. Fuck man what a piece of shit I was at times with this drug. I digress)

Today will be day 7 of the taper and day 2 of no extracts. My plan is to get in some exercise early. Exercise has been my silver bullet for this detox. The endorphins and then just being tired have helped. Sleep also. Not going to lie I’ve been taking a TON of herbal sleep aids to get to sleep. I planned this out before starting the detox because I heard that insomnia can happen. 

Going into any battle well prepared is always smart and that’s exactly what this group has helped me do. From the exercise, to the vitamins , the rest and scheduled time off of work. All of it has helped. So here’s to today 🥂 and the battle ahead. I go into it cautiously optimistic knowing that my enemy has been doing push-ups all night waiting for today and to take me out. I’ll stay connected and I’ll stay frosty.

Breaking away gets significantly harder & worse the deeper you get wrapped up within. To rationalize that there will be a better time to quit is an absolute lie. Do this for yourself now.

During the past 2.5 months, I have gradually reduced my kratom intake to four daily doses. Currently, I'm taking 0.45 grams upon waking, at 11:30 am, at 5:30 pm, and before bed. As someone who has used kratom almost every single day for more than eight years, I'm very excited about being so close to the finish line. 

I continue to reduce my dose by small amounts every other day, and getting close to the jumping point. Though I could jump now, I feel it is important to keep reducing the dose and getting closer and closer to zero before I stop altogether. 

For the most part, I have not been experiencing acute withdrawal symptoms ever since I got down to around 4 grams per day. Minor symptoms include very mild RLS at night, insomnia and an inability to go back to sleep if I wake up in the middle of the night, and an occasional ache that goes away within a few minutes. The only new symptom has been a persistent withdrawal cough which I am 94.3 percent certain is not COVID.  (I might post questions about this in a separate thread.) 

This morning, my wife was in the shower and I needed to get on the treadmill, so I skipped my usual morning dose and completely forgot about it for several hours. I eventually decided to wait until the 11:30 slot to take my kratom, which means that I'll only take three doses today. This is all great stuff. 

I'm wondering if the addiction is almost entirely in my mind at this point. I do feel those minor symptoms, and the cough is very annoying, but at some point it seems like there just won't be enough of the alkaloids in an individual dose for my receptors to even notice that I've taken something. On the other hand, I suppose that my receptors could have become incredibly efficient at processing all of the available alkaloids and are still extracting some effects from these tiny doses. 

Of course, everyone has a different body chemistry and different levels of sensitivity. I also realize that gradually reducing the availability of alkaloids is the entire premise of tapering, so my question is: at  what point do people think the 'physical' addiction has mostly diminished. 

To be clear, I'm not hoping to continue taking small doses of kratom indefinitely. I'm not feeling any positive cognitive or physical effects at this point and just want to get this green sludge out of my life. I'm simply wondering if the prison door is already unlocked and I merely need to open it and stroll outside.",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.44667196}"

I’m about 10 days in from 2-3 unnamed extracts a day (having taken that amount for around 1-2 years? Powder for a year preceding that) and I wanted to bring up something weird that’s happened to me, and is only now just ending. Curious to see if anyone has experienced similar.

The most common WD symptoms for me: extreme anxiety, panic attacks, inability to sleep, extreme RLS, the works.

Anyway, this is the main aspect I wanted to bring up. Last night, I woke up at 4a with the worst stomachs pain I’ve ever had. I could not hold water down, no liquid, still haven’t eaten. Preceding this was a mysterious feeling migraine; I get them frequently, but this felt different. Hard to explain. Now, I know that WDs can really come at you in any combination possible - but I’ve never ONCE experienced stomach pain as I did yesterday. I was vomiting every 20 minutes. Almost went to the ER I’d it wasn’t for the fact that by the end of the day I was able to hold down sips of water and knew I wouldnt dehydrate completely.

I used for almost 2 years. I'm unsure of exact dosage, but I think it was about 10-15g or so a day. (I used a medicine cup and filled it to 1tsp once a day) Sometimes took 2 doses, but usually cut them in half if I did. And there were times in the first year that I probably used 20g or so each day. 

I originally started using kratom for back pain. It helped a lot.......until it didn't any more. 

I quit CT on July 16. I had an episode of vertigo followed by a very weird uneasy feeling and decided that I'm never taking that stuff again. (In case it had anything to do with it). 

The first month was terrible. No sleep, crippling anxiety, depression, depersonalization, high heart rates, shortness of breath (I had this toward the end of my use as well), extreme fatigue,chest pain. I felt like I was going crazy. I ended up getting a prescription for Buspar to help with the anxiety. I think it helps some, but it's hard to tell.

Now at day 70, most of the symptoms are still lingering, but not quite as bad. I can usually sleep 6 hours or so, sometimes more. But still feel anxiety almost every day. Not as bad as before though. I still feel tired in the afternoon. 

For the last week I have been getting chest pains that have been there all day.  Sometimes it's the""normal"" center of the chest and sometimes it is the left side and my back. I've had an ekg, blood work, chest x-ray, currently wearing a holter monitor. So far everything checks out with my heart. The doctor says that my heart is fine, the anxiety and constant stress are to blame for the pain. Can't wait for this to pass, I think it gives me anxiety because I keep thinking something is wrong with me. 

Paws has been a pain for me. I felt like I was getting better around day 50, then got hit with a huge wave of anxiety and chest pains. Man, if I had any idea that this would happen, I never would have used this stuff. Oh well, I'm never touching it again, no matter what anyway. 

Don't let this discourage anyone. Yeah, this sucks, but soon it will pass and my life will be back to normal. I feel a little better just making this post.

I remember when I was still using but wanting to quit and seeing posts like the one I'm making now and thinking it was so far out of reach, I could never be strong like those people.  BUT I AM!  And you can too!  

 I only used kratom for 5 months but it was on the heels of a 10 month oxy stint.  My doctor weaned me off the oxy but I still had back pain and I was severely depressed and anhedonic after 2 weeks of quitting opiates.  I read about kratom in the opiate recovery sub and decided to give it a shot.  Wow, I thought, this stuff is almost the same feeling as oxy and I can use as much as I want and it's relatively inexpensive, AND it's just like quitting coffee they say.  This is for me!  Even though I believed all that, in my heart I knew it was wrong.  Then I started to realize I needed more and more to get that same feeling and once in a while the wobbles would strike and I knew that wasn't normal.  I spent the last 2 months trying to taper but kept failing.  I was up to 35gpd at the end and tapered to about 15 for a week then jumped.  First two weeks were utter hell.  Honestly I think it was worse than my oxy quit.  I had aching bones, sweating like a pig but freezing cold the whole time, akathisia, RLS, insomnia, debilitating stomach pain, violent sneezing fits, rebound back pain, depression, anxiety, you name it. Most of the physical symptoms subsided after 2 weeks but the depression and anxiety worsened.  

I'm still not 100% after 90 days.  I had some pink cloud moments after 2 weeks then again after a month.  The last month has been an emotional ride and I know I'm deep in PAWS.  I have started an SSRI but I think I needed that anyways because I'm going through a lot in my personal life.   Things I needed to deal with in life were put on hold during my oxy/kratom days and I have a lot to catch up on.  But I'm ready to take it on now and come out of this a better person!

I do know one thing, I thank the heavens above every single day that I am no longer a slave to the green sludge monster!  The stress of always making sure I had enough (it's not legal where I live so I had to order online) and when the package was late I would have to lay in bed with withdrawal staring at my phone for that text from the post saying the package was ready to pick up.  PURE HELL!   I figure I have saved about $600, which is nuts because money is tight right now.

i've been using kratom every day since i turned 18 three years ago and my average dose per day now is 30-40grams per day PLUS i've been using a lot of extracts lately which are expensive and have really ratcheted up my tolerance/cravings. 

it's made my life & mental health so much worse over the last few years. i've never been more depressed in my life and that's saying something bc as a teenager i was addicted to opioids (oxy, hydro, heroin, etc.) and cocaine and was a suicidal trainwreck. i have such an addictive personality, severe depression, and a shitload of ptsd from abuse and growing up with a chaotic and manipulative mother who has borderline personality disorder. 

the last few years don't even feel real. it's all a blur. there's nothing significant about them. jm 21 years old working a minimum wage part time job and living with my parents still. everything just feels so cloudy and dark and bleak and i don't feel like i'm living at all. it feels like a never-ending nightmare. a nightmare that i keep reliving every single day over and over and over. i deal w a lot of chronic pain (probably from the kratom & general poor state of physical health bc of my mental state) and just don't feel like i'm actually LIVING.

I was able to kick the alcohol problem 6 years ago and never looked back. Not the same with opioids. I am 100 percent disabled Veteran so the VA was feeding me oxy like candy. (Those were the days.🤣) I realized it had gotten bad 4 years ago when I was taking at least 120mg just to maintain. I decided I was going cold turkey detox. After feeling like I was going to die for a week, I was able to kick the oxy physically. I still thought about it, and still do 4 years later, daily. To ""prevent"" my self from using oxy, I jumped on the suboxone train. I took 16mg of suboxone for 2 years. If I thought opioid withdraw was bad... Holy sh*t suboxone was 10x worse. After going through almost 2 weeks of withdrawal from hell, I couldn't take it anymore. In comes kratom to the rescue.

I started taking a gram here or there. Then a couple grams... So on and so forth. Now, I just judge by the spoonful. I guess each spoon to be about 10grams and am taking 2 spoonfuls 5-10 times a day. Yeah, I know WAAAAY more than a therapeutic dose🤦. I feel like shit all the time. Am constantly sleepy, isolate hard, have bad depression, have no motivation etc. Some of this is caused from past trauma and mental disorders but I have not been this low since recovering from alcohol. The mental part is the worst but I don't know how much my liver and kidneys can take either. I realized my sink was clogged with kratom. Got me to thinking that if it does that to a sink, can't imagine what my liver, kidneys and intestines look like🤮. If I'm being honest, kratom never did much for the pain. Although that's what I told people I took it for. Addict thinking at its finest.

I am done depending on this stuff. The problem I'm having is it's so damn easy to get! It isn't destroying my relationships and life like alcohol. It isn't emptying my bank account like oxy. So I'm having a hard time even beginning to taper. 

If you've gotten this far, thank you for bearing with me. In a ""normal"" world I would go to any variety of the ""anonymous"" groups, as I've have success there before.

I am new to reddit but I read online that this is a good place to talk to other people who are struggling with the same thing I’m going through. I started Kratom about 2 years ago. The reason I started was because of injuries and anxiety. I was a high level gymnastics and went through a lot of mental abuse and injuries. The first time I took it, my anxiety completely went away and my back and shoulder pain suddenly disappeared. Because of how it made me feel, I started taking more and more. I feel like it has taken over my life and I spend all my money on it. I am also a nursing student and with the amount of stress I’m going through, it helps calm me down so I can focus on studying. I need help and know I am completely addicted to Kratom. The last few days I have decreased the amount I was taken an unbelievable amount and tomorrow, I will not be taking it ever again (at least I really hope now). I know I can’t do it anymore and I want to stop completely. Just by lowering doses it was difficult. I have a complete psychological addiction to it. I would love if anyone can give me suggestions on how to deal with the withdrawals. My doctor told me it should be about a week for the major withdrawals to go away and then I should be good. Thank you to anyone who took the time to help. I am so proud of myself for taking this step. I am just very worried about this next week of not doing it at all.

The eye wobbles were making my life miserable but had to deal with them because of the doses i needed to not WD and it got very expensive. As a former opiate addict i could quickly see after the first few months i was getting back into the addict mindset and carrying addict behavior around with me and im just so thankful it is all over. After a year and a half of using kratom every single day i am telling the complete truth when i say I DO NOT MISS IT AT ALL. Wish i never even started taking it but i cannot dwell too much on the past. Praying for all of those out there struggling still. I dont believe for a second that if you are a heavy kratom user that you are happy with the addiction i hope you make the choice to get yourself off of it, if i can do it anybody can :) if anybody needs somebody to give advice or even just to let another soul know how they are doing and feeling dont be shy to comment i am here for anybody going through this.

After how much I’ve suffered being on it for 5 years and not being able to stop without horrific withdrawals, I can confidently say I don’t want to touch it ever again. I’d be insane to put myself through all of that again.

To be fair, my body does miss it at times. I have these feelings at night where I reminisce on how it used to feel when it kicked in well. 

But, I truly don’t want it anymore. To be able to sleep every night without waking up in agony is incredible. Never worrying about dosing again is better than the high. The fact that I thought it was IMPOSSIBLE for me to stop and seeing that I’m at day 76 is better than the fleeting few hours you get from Kratom. It’s a drug that can be too easily abused for me and there is no situation where I can take it even once. Once will cause the whole ship to sink again. 

If you are suffering, life is so much better on the other side of this nasty shit. Life is still going to be hard, things will stress you out or make you depressed. However, by beating Kratom and having a clear head, you will prove to yourself that you can actually get through almost anything. And you’ll be free of this literal purgatory state that you are still stuck in. You will evolve and that will cause your life to get better in ways you won’t expect.

Hey everyone. I’ve posted in here a bit, never a quitting thread but motivational things to try and help others on their quitting threads. My story is somewhat common. I am getting out of the Army on September 25th (my last official day in), and the next day I plan to go cold turkey. I’m not sure what my GPD is. I’ve never once tried to measure it. I do a decent sized table spoon (yes table not tea), about 6-10 times a day. Depending on the day. I got hurt in the army on deployment and this is when I became an everyday user (my wife would mail me it). 

A little bit about my history, I was a heroin addict for about 8 years IV, so I know the hell of a next few weeks that I’m in for. I’ve been to more rehabs, meetings, and detox facilities than I care to admit. I joined the Army while living in south Florida in a halfway house, had I not joined I probably would have OD’d at some point. So I joined, and basically as soon as I got out of OSUT(basic training), I began drinking incredibly heavy. I’ve gotten in a lot of trouble in the Army due to my drinking and actions while drinking, luckily not enough to get me kicked out however. Anyway, on deployment I broke a part of my back that’s been forever painful ever since, so that’s when I stopped drinking and started taking kratom everyday, especially a few months after I got hurt and we came back from deployment. That was a year ago at the beginning of this month, haven’t missed a day without Kratom since being home. 

So, I know this isn’t what people want to hear, but the reason I am waiting until I get out to quit is because I plan to smoke Marijuana. I moved to Denver so it’s legal and I’m just waiting until that last day so I don’t risk being called back to my unit for a UA (I’m on terminal leave). I would love to do it without having to smoke, and I’m not going to act like it’s for the pain in my back. It will help for that and that will be great. However, since being 14 (I’m 29 now) I’ve never been able to not have some kind of substance in my life. I went 2 years complete abstinence in halfway, and I literally hated my life. I’m on depression medication and all that good stuff, always have been, I just simply do not like life sober. So I have quite a bit of different non narcotic pharmaceuticals that I think I can use as well to help with sleep and RLS, etc. Like everyone else I know how withdrawals feel, and I hate it. I’m the biggest sissy when it comes to lack of sleep and just withdrawals as is. But I’m going for it. I thought about tapering but let’s be honest, do I sound like the type of person that can taper? Haha no. 

So I’m just coming here to let you all know, my journey is soon to begin! I’m both extremely excited and terrified to get this going. I’m hoping some people might be able to throw me some tips and tricks that helped them throughout the early stages. Like I said, huge sissy lol. Also, I always love words of encouragement.

Coli test 100%. After trying to quit cold turkey the last few weekends I decided I needed to taper. However, I’m having a really hard time cutting my dose even a little bit. 
Then I remembered I was taking this brand before I quit in February and it was, by far, the hardest quit I’ve done. When I picked up again, I was taking another brand that I quit In July. I was taking almost double the amount. I tapered a little bit in a short amount of time before I quit, yet I was still taking more than when I quit In February. 
I couldn’t tell at all when I was cutting my doses before my quit in July (which were relatively significant) and when I finally jumped I had a very easy time and my symptoms were completely over after 5 days and I stayed off it for the longest I have since starting kratom. I gave it some more thought and i believe that I’ve struggled to quit every time I take this particular brand.

I did some tests und was asked questions by the brain doctor and told him about my kratom usage.

He said he doesn't know that substance yet and will research it. Hours later he said I should stop that immediately because it's proven to lower the seizure treshold.

So today is day 11 free from all substances, and kratom especially because that was the one substance that I struggled for the longest time to put down. Up until today, everything was going for the most part okay. I had some days where I was feeling very very well, and other days that were rough. 

Recently I've gone back to work, and my drive home is very long. Yesterday the cravings and irritability were the strongest that I've dealt with since quitting. I'd say they were stronger than the last few times that I attempted to quit. I thought yesterday was going to be the toughest, but today's ride home was by far the worst. 

The whole drive home it was a back and forth debate with myself if I should or shouldn't buy more kratom. I made myself eat because my logic is that if I take kratom on a full stomach, I wouldn't feel it. I was still hungry and still in a terrible mood. I caved, went to the store, and purchased my favorite strain. After an hour or so goes by (I didn't take any), I decide to run an errand or two while still debating if I should or shouldn't break my longest sober streak that I've had in a long time. I ended up pulling up to the store to purchase a game I've been wanting to play, and with the kratom in my hand, I decided to throw it away, buy the game, and then treat myself to some food :) 

This is the first time I have ever purchased a drug with the intent of relapsing and then tossing it. I didn't get high and I'm still sober!!! 

I thought this would make me feel better in the end, and I'm glad that I didn't take any, but I'm still incredibly irritated, in a bad mood overall, and mentally exhausted. I have a lot fear inside of me rn because that was an extremely close call. Again, I'm thankful I didn't cave and this is a milestone, but it doesn't exactly feel like it.",32,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.43795323}"

I’ve read just about every thread in this r/ for help getting off Kratom. I was severely addicted. I mean I would go through 300 capsules of white maeng da in 2-3 days. It took over my life and made me do a lot of things I regret. I tried going ct several times and would make it about a week. I got through the flu like symptoms just fine. But the restless leg syndrome took over my whole body at night. I couldn’t sleep at all. It was the closest I’ve ever been to wanting to die. I was in a really dark place and I felt like I deserved the misery for all I put myself and my wife through. I also tried to taper down but the anxiety during the day and the RLS at night was still very prevalent. I had not been to a general physician for at least a decade but I finally sucked it up and made an appointment. I was too ashamed to tell the truth about the kratom use but I told the doc all about the restless leg syndrome and how it was through out my whole body at night. She prescribed me 2 months worth of Gabapentin for it. I didn’t have much hope for it working as I felt like I kind of screwed myself by not revealing the kratom use to the doc. But nevertheless I started taking the Gabapentin as soon as I picked it up from the pharmacy. I took the first dose and within an hour or so literally every ounce of the anxiety and the non stop butterflies in my stomach melted away and I felt normal again. I was ecstatic! But I was still dreading going to bed that night because I thought there was no way this drug could stop the hell I was experiencing. But I took the other two doses, one at lunch and one after dinner. Around 9 PM the wife and I went to bed. I had my leg massager and muscle rub cream all ready like I did every night in my futile attempts to dull the RLS. We watched an episode or two of Friends and I was anticipating the RLS to start within 20 minutes like it always did. I ended up passing out during the 3rd episode of Friends. And when I tell y’all that was the best night of sleep I have ever had, I am not exaggerating! My point is don’t be afraid to go to the doctor for help with this. I know some of these drugs don’t help some people. But if you’re like me don’t put it off. Get help. It is possible to quit. Don’t ignore that possibility. I am on week 3 since quitting and haven’t had a symptom since starting the gaba. I just thought I’d share my story and try to help anyone else that’s suffering.

I totally lost track of how many days during the rough parts of withdrawal so i don't know for sure, but I think i'm finally making it out of acute and into PAWS. These last couple weeks have been absolutely awful. Went to the doctor who prescribed me Hydroxyzine, which made me feel more shitty, but helped the anxiety. Glad to say, that i'm finally past the rough part and my outlook on life is much more positive today.

Sit and setting was important. Since I did most of my kratom in my bedroom alone with my dog, my anxiety seemed to be the highest there. I spent most of the acute phase out of my room and while it was still awful, it seemed to help quite a lot socializing with my friends out of the usual place

My advice to you is, limit your caffeine consumption, like really limit it if you drink caffeine. Literallya couple sips of an energy drink made my anxiety rocket sky high during the initial phase of withdrawal. Next is absolutely stay busy no matter what, play a video game, or go exercise, meditate anything is better than setting around wondering why you took kratom in the first place.

Well Its officially 14 days since my last 4 gram dose of Kratom. I'll start by saying Mondays are the worst.  I hate Mondays so I know its just playing into my bad mood today. When I leave on Friday the work at my plant continues. My job is to come in Monday and organize/fix everything that went wrong over the weekend. 

With that said the want to take some Kratom is strong. I so just want to put a smile on my face. I long for my brain chemicals to become overly happy. The physical withdrawals are gone. I'm sleeping fairly well compared to most stories I've read. Waking at 5 hours of sleep to then periodically drift in and out till my alarm goes off.  Appetite is still not back to normal. Tested it out with my favorite lunch. Only got through half of what I'd normally eat. 

The adhedonia and bad mood are still as real as they were when I started. Even this saturday/sunday I was struggling to have avg happiness. Once again knowing some kratom will turn that frown upside down. 

Working out has been getting tougher not easier. No sun in the morning makes me want to lay in bed. The fact that stimulants are having zero affect on making me more awake does not help my cause. I used to have 3 capsules of kratom and 50 mg of caffeine on my bed side table. Alarm at 445 am, take the vitamins, then ""caffeine"" nap for 25 more minutes while it would kick in. This would make for the easiest of wake ups and go getter mentality.  Now 200 mg caffeine and L-Theanine doesn't do anything. I legit slept through taking it on Saturday morning. Thankfully anxiety has not been an issue after the first few days of CT passed. Though Black seed oil did help a bit.

Guess that is all for today. I'm stupid to have believed it would be all roses by now. My stubbornness and determination will continue me on this path of not taking Kratom.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.61762565}"

So I started a taper since then. Last Thursday morning before work I took my last dose at 6 grams. And I honestly feel pretty good except the bubble guts and runs. I have very minor anxiety and brain fog but it's very manageable. I slept well last night.

The first time I tried to quit I was at 15-20 gpd half in morning half after work. I tapered down to 5 grams only in the morning. Thursday was the day I jumped after reading a few people's updates on this thread.

So far so good just barely started feeling somewhat normal emotionally today.

I just want to thank everyone on this sub for their updates and motivation for me to think about stopping. Honestly I thought life was normal drinking the tea. I justified it as my morning coffee. I been on it since 2017 after motorcycle accident and I broke my leg. I can say that kratom helped me off oxy, but now I can actually feel normal starting to come back. 3 years I forgot what normal life was. Anyways I hope this can help at least 1 person. I'll update in a few more days to see if anymore symptoms arise.

I was taking 10 grams a day for a couple months then went down to around 5 grams a day for another couple months.  last month I didn't go over 3 grams.

Has anyone had a similar dose to me that could tell me their experience? I have noticed small amounts of a lot of the symptoms described here like extreme boredom, mild panicky moments, and I had some depression when I tapered down to less than 3 grams per day though that seems to have almost disappeared.

So I have been trying to ""taper"" myself from 24-30 grams a day and lemme tell you something kicking heroin I swear was a cake walk compared to what I was going thru the other day.. I was huge fan of the blend train wreak for obvious reasons but Soo not a fan of the withdraw with it. So now I do 5-7g wake up at 7 am and boy Kratom is the best alarm clock.. moving forward I try and wait 6-8 in-between but recently it's been about 4-6 hours I'll start feeling off..I actually get horrid indegestion and anxiety attacks but with that I have also been dabbing with Crystal Meth aka Ice -NOT RECOMMEND EVER!! They both target the same receptors and I wanna say the ice was making the Kratom withdraw come faster .. ok so now I try and do only 6g wake and twice during day depending on how bad 2-4 grams and all these doses anew Green Maeng Da and at bedtime it the Red MD and about 6-7grams but I'm need to cut back more and in a way I don't get all the uncommon withdraw symptoms cuz I'm that gal that will get those and not the normals one.. Kratom will kill your kidney function main reason I need to come off because my kidneys are shot to tell and now have CKD- chronic kidney Disease.. and it's awful.. so yeah my usual withdrawal symptoms are heart palpitations sweats extreme irritability and my legs twitch only when I'm walking around when I'm laying down I get the arm flaps which is really weird and we all know about the constipation factor. And how fun that can be so if anybody can please please help me with a good taper regimen so I don't feel all that and can function normally and go to work and be human I would greatly appreciate it thank you.. 💯💚

Always have had a job, my family is doing fine financially but I have a drug problem. Earlier this year (mainly due to being off work for two months, paid,) I was abusing lsd, mushrooms, kratom, phenibut. This is bc I can’t smoke weed, which is what has always kept me grounded. I was barely functioning going through phenibut WD. It landed me in a hospital parking lot once, and I was having daily panic attacks. The mixture of kratom and phenibut slowly turned me into a hypochondriac which I’m finally gaining control of. 


I finally got my mind right after the phenibut WD, and then the kratom started making me paranoid/dizzy/depressed but I still kept taking it bc that’s all I knew. This lasted about two weeks before I said enough. I got my dose down to about 6 or 7 half tsp before this started. As of this past Tuesday, I started only taking 2 half tsp at night, along with lower doses of gabapentin during the day which I know I need to stop. I’ve just felt unhealthy lately. I got a gym membership semi recently and have been using it, even through the kratom WD. I’m on a walk as we speak bc I felt like shit laying around the house all day. 

The kratom was giving me all of these weird symptoms, and most have since subsided. I’m going to try and not dose at all tonight, hopefully am at a low enough dose where it won’t be so bad. I’m so done with the ups and downs, and damaging my body with these substances. I feel better than the past week, especially when I’m up and doing something. I feel dizzy, brain fog, headache, and worried about what was in the kratom I was taking recently. That’s the main factor in my quit, is why it was making me feel so weird. I felt so positive earlier this year. 

I’ve been through the hardcore opiates in my younger years, so I know how this goes. This shit just feels so dirty. Something bad was building up in my system it feels like after I changed vendors. It’s tough bc my days have been rough for awhile, and since I take much less kratom lately the little dose I take at nice is actually relieving... but at the same time this is the FIRST time I actually feel like I’m taking a drug that is toxic, besides phenibut in its own ways.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59014285}"

Quit 3 months ago. If I can do it, you can do it!","For me, it started out as ""If *they* can do it, *maybe* I can do it."" (That's called HOPE.) Now hope is a reality. The same thing that helped me early on continues to help me today: [Wim Hof Method breathing exercises](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/7si4ui/the_wim_hof_methodan_awesome_little_set_of/), daily cold showers, trying to keep a positive attitude, not ""romanticizing"" the least little thought of using again (as I always say, **I don't believe the LIES my addict brain tells me**) and (seemingly the most helpful of all) submerging myself in this QK subreddit.

The things I've added to my routine over the past few weeks that have helped tremendously: morning jogs / walks 6 days a week, longer walks with my dogs (they're happier too!), an evening walk at night if I'm restless or not feeling tired / sleepy, and yard work a couple or few times a week (this week was a lot of hedge and branch trimming... I never thought I'd climb a ladder again). CBD also helps me, especially at night to combat my pain (which usually hits strongest after 5pm like clockwork... and even that's improving!) and getting to sleep. 

I also try not to let anger, frustration and resentment built up inside of me. If I don't agree with someone or am bothered by something, I try to ""let it out"" as calmly as possible. But on the flip side of that, I'm also learning to ""pick my battles"". (Some people ya' just can't reason with, or you're going to have to ""agree to disagree"". It's ok to just calmly walk away.) It's also ok to be wrong... And to admit that.
 
Essentially, doing the things I never wanted to do or thought I couldn't do while using kratom, are the things that keep me off of it today. I suppose I'm one of the lucky ones... I don't ""crave"" or obsess over it (at least I haven't yet). Occasional thoughts (LIES my addict brain tells me)? Yes, of course. But I combat those lies with the TRUTH and staying busy. I find that if the body is busy, the mind remains at ease. Is my life perfect? Of course not. Am I happy and content 100% of the time? Of course not. But I'm not using kratom! Nor do I ever want to again. FOR ME relapse is NOT an option. I will NEVER be able to ""safely"" or moderately use kratom again. Nor would I want to if it was possible. I've not left any ""ifs"", ""ands"" or ""buts"" as negative dangling carrots that I am aware of. For me, there are no reasons to ever use again... only excuses. And I've long since run out of excuses.

Thank you to this entire subreddit. If you're struggling, hang in there. There was a time that I thought I'd never be able to quit. But I was (and still am) determined. I found the vigilance to keep on trying. I remain vigilant to stay quit. Probably the hardest thing for me was patience... patience with allowing my mind and body time to heal. They're probably still healing. If I can do this, I know you can too. If you don't have hope, faith and confidence in yourself, please use mine.

The last time I dosed was last friday, so I'm currently sitting at the end of the eighth day free from kratom. The last time I ""Successfully"" quit for a period of time, I cold turkeyed a 15gpd habit. The first few days were filled with depression and just feelings that nothing was entirely pleasurable. Once I managed to pass those first few days, I felt like a completely different person and managed to stay clean for about a month. I continued to use for a few months after this and it spiraled into a twice a day habit ranging from 15gpd to 4gpd and so forth. 

Last friday with the help of my girlfriend and friends, I decided to quit again for the 50th time, but things felt different. I haven't taken any kratom since and have been attemping to remain completely sober minus caffeine and nicotine.This week has been a total trip of absolute ups and downs. The first few days weren't exactly the hardest. Major anxiety and cravings in the morning due to my usage starting right as I woke up, feeling down for brief periods of time throughout the day, and eventually brief moments of natural euphoria from music and other activities with others. 

The fourth day was hardest with a solid chunk of the day leaving me in a rutt, but I managed to power through. Yesterday was one week clean and by the end of the night most of the positive feelings I was having seemed to have gone away.Today seems to be the hardest day overall. Music was one of my outlets and nothing seems to click, same with movies, or other activities that would have normally kept me preoccupied and somewhat okay. My body is aching fairly heavily and the cravings have been a little stronger throughout today. I'm exhausted even though I've done nothing today, but I'm also feeling very restless. 

I guess I'm wondering why are things are getting a little more difficult now vs earlier in the week? PAW's or could it still be the normal withdrawal symptoms? 
Either way, I'm gonna push through and I just needed an outlet, so if anyone here has read through this post, I appreciate you taking the time and wish you the best of luck in your journey! Hopefully tomorrow will be a much brighter day, and so fourth! Much love everyone

I had a battle with opioids one 2016, haven’t had one since. A friend introduced me to K, I felt like I did on pain killers. What a rush it bright back. A few hours after I felt irritable, and annoyed by most everything, but that opioid feeling, I enjoyed that, I could deal with the after effects...so I thought. 

I was doing 8-10gpd alternating between three stains. After about a month of a near dead limbo, irritable when not on it, weight loss who knows what - I have been feeling like crap when not on it, I was able to stop everyday use and go to every other and then every third. Most days between, were difficult, I couldn’t wait to take it again. The exact same feeling I had on opioids! This scared me.  

I recently went back to taking ever other, a few days back to back. Telling myself this is an exceptional time, as I am going through some tough times (who isn’t - but these are harder then normal times right now, entirely different long story - using K does help me lose that anxiety at but, but it comes back with a vengeance, or so it seems). 

Speaking of anxiety, few months back depression and anxiety kicked in unlike I have ever had. I have never been anxious, no where near like this. I just recently read on here that others experience heightened anxiety because of K too. Never crossed my mind! I am a part of other groups that praise K and they talk about how it saves them from a world of depression and anxiety. I didn’t think it may be cause mine. It was so strange to be having anxiety. I never experienced anything like it. 

Not that anyone cares about my story enough for all the details. 

Fast forward again. I Decided to stop two days ago. This morning I am feeling bad and have convinced myself that one more time and I’ll start a fresh stop tomorrow (or taper?). It has only been two days, what’s one more restart? 

I have never posted here, instead of mixing my glass of sludge I thought I’d vent.  I really do want to have one more go. But I know I’ll feel worse about myself on the come down, the urge tells me to overlook that. Just one more time... I am going to go exercise to see if I can get it off my mind.

What a wild drug kratom is. 

I really didn't believe the stories people said when they talked about how it was an addictive substance. I've never really dealt with addiction before, so I just assumed I didn't have an addictive personality that would lead me down this road. 

Wild times.

Anyways. I wasn't a user for that long. I started taking it because I thought it would help me in social situations that I was uncomfortable or nervous about (I had just started spending time with someone I was interested in), but it often left me feeling withdrawn and apathetic, and sometimes it caused me to just panic about stuff that didn't matter at all.

I was taking about 9-12 grams per day (my measurements weren't accurate) for about 2 months, which is on the fairly low end of the spectrum, so I really didn't think quitting kratom would be difficult. 

Man, was I wrong. This stuff isn't something to joke around with. 

I quit CT last Monday, and it's now Saturday. There's some tiny lingering effects still, but most of which I can ignore and no longer affect my daily life. 

Thank you for your stories. It helped me get through this and make me feel like I wasn't just losing my mind as I was quitting.

I was thinking about how one of the main reasons I liked kratom was because I thought it boosted my productivity and creativity (I write a lot and am also creating a lot of content for my new business). This was probably true in the beginning, because it gave me energy and also lowered my inhibitions slightly to where I wasn't overthinking what I wrote (is it perfect? Is it too controversial? etc).

But kratom only enhanced my creativity right after I took a dose. As soon as it started to fade away, I got dull and tired and foggy-brained. When the doses started to lose their original effect (towards the end) I couldn't be creative at all cause I thought I needed ""that feeling"" to do my best work. Plus I just started feeling like shit all the time and didn't want to do anything. 

Well, now that I'm mostly through the physical WDs, I have never felt more creative, motivated, and energetic. And although I've already said this before, the best part is knowing that I did it all on my own without relying on a substance to do it!

This is an amazing community with a lot of strong people. There are so many inspiring individuals here, I can't thank you enough for sharing your stories.  


I'm not sure why I started buying Kratom, really. I've never really been into drugs... only tried marijuana a few times and never really liked it, and only took hydrocodone/oxycodone as prescribed from bone fractures, etc. I think I stumbled on articles mentioning it when I was researching ways to overcome alcohol addiction, it sparked my curiosity, and I ordered some. It was at my doorstep two days later. I have to admit, I don't drink anymore, nor do I miss it, and I'm not sure I can discredit Kratom from helping with that (although, I'm not sure the addiction tradeoff was worth it).  


I'm currently near the end of a very, very, slow taper. I've been taking Kratom daily for two years now, at my height probably 28GPD, 9.3G\*3 doses/day. never forget the number 9.3G on the scale... for whatever reason, that's the number that scared me, and I knew I wouldn't go any higher. This is when I started having health issues (constipation, gut issues), performance suffering at work, etc.  This was the number where I realized an obscure powder was taking over my life.  


I've since turned a chapter in life, and I consider myself extremely lucky. I started a Kratom taper about 8 months ago, and I've recently quit vaping using nicotine patches (nicotine, caffeine, alcohol have been the only other substances I've ever been addicted to). Once I kick the Kratom, it'll just be me and coffee again (I hope!).  As of right now, I'm way more productive, once again a top-performer at work, my wife enjoys being around me again, and as of two weeks ago, have learned I'm going to become a dad.  


My taper looked something like this:

* Morning Dose (started @ 8G)
* 4x doses after morning dose throughout the day (started \~5G)

Each day, I'd reduce the weight of each dose by a tenth of a gram (0.1G)... VERY slow. I had a couple of by-weeks where I wouldn't reduce at all, which seemed to help normalize things for me.  


Today, I'm currently at 1GPD (0.6G morning dose, 4x 0.1G doses through day), and I'm thinking it's time to take the leap. The resolution of my scale won't go lower than a tenth of a gram, so it's sort of forcing my hand.

3 months heavy use shouldnt be bad right? The only thing I noticed is since Ive gone through wds from opiates, alcohol and kratom now several times.. the speed I get back to where I used to be is a lot shorter. Like it took me a long time to build up enough tolerance to wd from alcohol. Last time i got back in it took a few months before I was shaking and vomiting with no hangover. Could have been shorter for all I know. I didnt stop drinking during that time.

I know replacing isnt the best long term plan but for now im going back to being a stoner. Eating an edible and some cbd is much better for my health than taking kratom.

I have no clue what its sprayed with. Its coming from overseas and not FDA regulated. They could be spraying it with god knows what chemicals. Also it fucks with your organs and brain function. Not good. Fuck that. Im done.

Thanks for giving people a platform here to talk about this shit. I hate being an addict. It fucking sucks. Most people dont understand how hard it is to battle yourself. Like arguing with yourself over if you should use again or not is absurd.

Swollen lymph nodes, semi severe dizzyness that didn’t feel like what a normal wobbles would feel like (only a few times this happened,) major uneasyness, etc.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7574125}"

From some other users and my own research I’ve landed on 2-3mg melatonin, 500mg of magnesium and l-theanine, but I’d like to get some other ideas.

I used Kratom for 9+ years every day. 10-30 Grams

Kratom would give me nausea at such high doses so I would wash it down with Vodka (when I wasn't at work or on vacation) - So I was able to quit two habits, I still drink beer, but I reduced my alcohol about 60%.

Before stoping, you have to constantly say in your mind, write it down, say it to whomever, 10,000 times for weeks I am done with this crap - I will never touch it again. You want to demonize it as much as you can. I would think of all the time how my addiction was controlling my life.

I took a two-week vacation and let my family know, if you can, let your immediate family know because it will help with the process of withdrawing, knowing that they know you are going to feel like crap.

You must have Gabapentin or you will not sleep at all (and I mean at all) due to restless legs also, I would get a good multivitamin and B12 Spray. Also, some kind of mood stabilizer, if at all possible, I was lucky I am prescribed Ritalin. I would avoid things like Phenibut even for a day or two (I did it a day or two), and it crushes my mood a few days after. Do not take Suboxone.

Do not trade one habit for another.

Exercise is key to getting a little dopamine. I jogged every day, which I still do now.

I used Gabapentin for a month and just stopped, no W/D

Where ever you did kratom, mine was in the basement of my house, rearrange the room as much as you can.

I burned all my Kratom, $300 worth. It's symbolic.

Week Two on Vacation, I stopped cold turkey – Tapers do not work for most people because it is so easy to just up the dose especially on the weekends. I tried tapering, no luck.

Day 1 – Not much happened until nightfall. Restless legs started – Gabapentin works miracles.

Day 2-5 – Physical Symptoms kick in

Overall stamina drops like crazy

Restless legs only at night (Gabapentin)

I was breathless walking upstairs.

Body pains.

Diarrhea (which will last 2-4 weeks)

I used 2mg of Imodium, and it worked well, do not abuse Imodium.

Overall lethargic.

Depression (Mine was not terrible).

No desire to do anything at all

Sneeze all the time.

Muscle Jerks, not terrible though

I had crazy intense cravings, one of the worst symptoms, but it was not for Kratom. It was bizarre and would last around 5-10 minutes every hour or so.

My mood was not that bad because I still tried to have fun on vacation. I was lucky the house was on a lake, go out in the boat even though I did not want to. However, once you force yourself to do something, you feel a lot better. I was surprised my anxiety levels decreased when I stopped (I will chalk this up to Gabapentin). I am prescribed Ritalin, which I abused just to have some kind of normalcy (Not recommended, ran out before I could refill and I was exhausted).

Believe it or not, Kratom gives you a hangover, nothing crazy just brain fog the next morning. I would wake up and be like holy crap my brain is clear. I started waking up an hour early than before.

Day 5-10

Mood gets slightly worse

Ran every morning (You need to exercise to increase Dopamine levels)

Again had no cravings for Kratom

I continued to have less anxiety from baseline

Restless legs

Change daily habits, mix it up, avoid places you did kratom

Take time by yourself, reflect on life.

No News / Anything that is a downer

Physical stamina was lacking.

Day 10-30

Back to work (Which helped me)

Depression

Feel crappy

Restless Legs Stopped around day 20-30.

Very hard because you are so accustomed to using it daily, it messes with you.

This is where people relapse because it is hard to get back into the usual life.

This is where most people relapse because it is hard to follow through with it.

Keep telling yourself kratom is the devil, make yourself feel sick just about the thought of it.

Stopped Gabapentin

In some sense, it is worse than the first week because now you have to deal with real-life without it.

Day 30-60

Fleeting depression

You feel like you dopamine is slowly coming back

Still not at baseline before kratom

Still hard to deal with life without kratom

It takes some time to kill the daily habit stuck in your mind.

I found some Kratom and tossed it out, do not ever take it again.

Taking it again will become a habit eventually (I can not control it personally)

Day 60-120

At some point, you will no longer think about it as much because you changed the habit

I want to say I am back to normal, however, it is still difficult to live your life not having Kratom as a coping mechanism.  I am so used to using Kratom when drinking for the boost it gave me, so when I drink I immediately am looking for a stimulant, I landed on coffee.  I wish I could kick drinking altogether because it reminds me of Kratom.  So those who just have a Kratom habit, it will be easier to quit IMHO.

Still Jogging.

At first, you think it is going to take forever, 3-6 months fly by.

Post-acute withdrawal syndrome takes roughly six months. When you get there, your dopamine levels start increasing as your brain is adjusting. Kratom dumps out your dopamine, so your body stops producing it.  It is pretty damn awesome when it comes back.  I was like this is freaking amazing, I can be happy without Kratom",34,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.48957282}"

I went to detox and a week after i got out i said “hey i can get a little kratom for a buzz. Just once and i wont do it again”

Classic stupid addict logic

I was taking kratom on and off for a few years. Now its been everyday for 3 months. I just recently started taking more and more and more everyday. Im treating it like alcohol where i dont stop till it makes me so dizzy, i can hardly drive and focus my eyes on anything. It sucks. 

If i tell my fiancee, she will probably leave me. I cant keep breaking her trust and sneaking my addictions behind her back. I will lose her trust completely.

I said tonight that this is it. Id love to have a kratom buzz everyday but i cant handle it. I just know it. How long does it take to build up enough tolerance to wd? I was doing aroubd ten gpd at the beginning and now ill eat like 60-70 of the bagged pre-capped capsules. Im gonna weigh em out but my guess is about .4 per so anywhere from 25-30gpd.

I actually only had mild withdrawals for a few days and it was over with (The worst part was my eyes constantly watering?). I was however opiate naive and only 22, daily gym goer, and healthy eater.

Since then, i had a break for about a year, then started abusing multiple hard opiates for short periods of time and stopping, always getting withdrawals for a few days. I abused the hardest opiate there is for 3-4 weeks and had severe withdrawals for 2 weeks following. Now the only reason I can think of that it was so bad is that i kept putting my body in and out of addiction regularly, and even though only for short periods of time, it messed up my brains neurology (there is a word for this exact process but I cant remember it).

I then took to Kratom, again, to help keep me away from the harder stuff. 6 months down the road I was up to 20gpd and realising why I quit the previous time. Morning withdrawals feeling like i've been run over by a heavy goods vehicle, brain fog, performance reducing at work (I'm a high level sales executive paid a lot of money, I can't afford this to happen).

So I decided to quit CT, Terrible idea, could not work and the sweating was insane, all standard WD symptoms, dont need to go through them. So I jumped back up to my normal dosing schedule, and dropped a gram per day until i was at 8 gpd.

From 8gpd I started using capsules, and dropped 2 caps a day (each cap is 0.35-0.38g). Now im at around 2.2gpd, and honestly, I didnt even feel the slightest withdrawal any of the way through this fairly fast taper. In fact, at about 6gpd, i actually felt more of a 'high' from the kratom than i did at 20gpd.

I know this goes against the grain of this sub, and trust me, I am 100% an advocate for this sub over the other naive one that we all probably fell for at the start of our kratom usage.

But, I just wanted to share this as I am so surprised myself how painless this has been, Im going to drop a single cap a day now until im at 0, then never look back at this terrible substance again.

So, I guess i'm writing this not only as a process for myself of nailing the coffin of Kratom in my life by sharing my experience, but also to say that the WD process is so strange and is never the same for anybody, or even any single person's different quitting attempts. If CT is painful, just try a taper, you may end up like me who's wondering how the hell I didnt have to pay the piper.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.641774}"

This is my first actual post. Today I am a full 30 days free from Kratom. I have dealt with Opiod related addiction off and on for the past 20 years. The worst of it was a long period of snorting extended release Oxymorphone. From that I jumped solely to Kratom, but not without extending my Opana use (I just used Kratom to eliminate the constant  withdrawal that came with that drug when I didn't have any) Eventually though, I was able to finally break the Opiate pill addiction all together- I have NO desire whatsoever to ever go down that road again....  But after the passing of my 5month old son, My Kratom usuage became astronomical! And stayed that way for a very long time...years. A little over a year ago, I was up to average 88GPD and sometimes more. I had gotten to a point where I was literally only using it to stop from being in Withdrawal. I couldn't even take a 3 hour nap without waking up in full-blown withdrawal. It was still helping tremendously with pain...but I was gaining NO other benefit- and had to dose just to be able to function. I wasn't (for the past 2 and a half years) ever able to eat anything without knowing it would make me either fall asleep unwillingly, or feel incredibly grumpy and physically beyond sluggish for hours after (so I never ate anything expect right before bed)- I realized I was in a never ending state of Anhedonia have been unable to feel pleasure for years because of Kratom. So,    about a year ago, I started to taper, without any strict expectations. At first, I just wanted to lower my daily usage, because I couldn't afford buying a kilo every 2 weeks. I did drastically lower my dosage fairly quickly without any negative withdrawal, After all I was constantly battling withdrawal anyway.... eventually I got to anpoint where I was sleeping better, and waking up every morning feeling less and less intense withdrawal. I kept comfortably dropping more and more, to a point where I was only dosing 2-3 times per day, AND I was able to wake up every morning, get ready for work and not take my first dose till after already getting to work. During that time period of my Taper, I was able to enjoy music again, and have random genuine small laughs here and there. I sat for quite a few mo ths only dosing 1 tsp 2-3times a day, and I was mentally comfortable there, thinking that I would be proud of myself If I just stayed with that.-I realize now, that It was vital for me to feel proud of myself having gotten to that point, and being comfortable there. I used to not be able to Get moving at all in the morning without first downing 6tsp's and waiting half hour.... but even though I was proud of myself, I always had the knowing in the back of my mind that I wasn't free from dealing with withdrawl, and I also knew I couldn't progress along my spiritual journey the way I am meant to if I kept using. 
     I ended up having leave a domestic abuse situation, and my Husband who had relapsed back on the Heroin bus earlier this year. I moved to a whole new state in June, and by the end of July found myself back up to using 5 tsp per day.... not cool...and really I recognized that it was because I suddenly no longer had a constant  flow of adrenaline stringing me along, the Anhedonia had returned...I was bored seeking stimulation. Just like  most others, I completely ran out of money, and made the Decision that it was time to be completely free. I was running out already, but had enough to do a very rapid Taper...I got down to 1/4tsp 2 times a day for 2 days, and jumped- My acute withdrawal was manageable to still function, but the Anhedonia hit full force on day 6...that second week sucked worse than the first...but now here I am 30 days completely clean! Completely clean except Caffiene and nicotine- but to me, those Don't count lol. I am not even on any SSRI. I am CLEAN! Most of my physical withdrawal is gone. The lingering Anhedonia, is still with me, and I think I am gonna have to accept that it will be for a while.... I stopped being able to enjoy music again(I had a bit of Pink cloud during the first 5 day and Being able to enjoy music those days was encouraging) For now, Anhedonia, but Can honestly say I'm not depressed...my normal level of anxiety is back to full force but not enough to want to take something to make it stop.

Edit: I’m dropping the kratom I just can’t handle CT, I went through hell with phenibut WD just a few months ago and it damaged me.

So I’ll begin by saying I have been on one opiate or another for almost the past 10 years, I’m such a fucker (28.) I think my past experience with WD opiates has actually made this worse rather than easier. (Methadone, heroin, oxycodone, Dilaudid etc..) 

I got down to a pretty low dose, idk exactly but about six 1/2 tsp the last few weeks or more. Kratom started making me feel really weird the past two weeks, so I’m dropping it. I became a hypochondriac after quitting phenibut a little over two months ago, and the kratom makes it WORSE. 

Yesterday I only took 3 1/2 and today I only took 1 so far.

What neurochemicals process causes this blank state, no emotion anhedonia?","I noticed ever since I started Kratom 27 months ago, I'm barely interested or passionate about anything in life other than working, coming home and staring at a computer screen.

Maybe it's just me getting older and growing up, but I used to be a video game fanatic from age 5 until 26 years old when I started up on Kratom. If I try to play any game nowadays, I just feel empty and uninterested. I don't feel any joy, just a blank state so I don't even bother with a lifelong hobby I used to be a fanatic over. I went 4 months without loading up a single game which made me sad.

Same with music and social interactions. On Kratom I can't stand music and feel blank. I drive my car in complete silence. But when the withdrawal hits music sounds better and I can even feel strong emotions come through from the audio stimuli. Like a cloud slowly being lifted.

Why does Kratom rob happiness and joy when in the beginning, it ""gave"" the user joy and contentment? Is it Just tolerance and the drug basically reversing itself, causing opposite effects?

Will I enjoy even simple video games again off Kratom? I'm tired of feeling dead inside everyday for a fleeting buzz (it rarely ever does anything anymore except a small energy boost) Woop-de-do",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7312131}"

\-**Insomnia**...I've always been the type of person who sleeps super lightly and if I have any type of stimulant in the afternoon I get horrible sleep, so I suspect this insomnia will stick with me for a while. 4-5 seems to be the usual number hours I can get with melatonin, CBD, and magnesium. Every few days I take a Xanax which has been a total lifesaver to keep me from going more insane.

\-**This feeling that my whole body is vibrating super fast** (especially my core). This is pretty much constant and is either worse at night or I just notice it more then.

**-Exhaustion**...Usually kicks in in the afternoon. A mixture of sleepiness and just not being able to make my body do much.

\-**Panic attacks**...I've woken up from what little sleep I get by them a few times. Luckily I have experience with them and they don't scare me too much but still...not fun. Also other weird emotions/sensations that I've never felt before...kind of like a weird hybrid of dread and disgust very randomly.

\-**Body aches**...I do intense workouts and had no pain/soreness at all while taking kratom so I guess it's only fair. These are finally getting better.

\-**Diarrhea/nausea**...slowly getting better

**Gratitude is really getting me through, so what I'm thankful for today is:**

\-**This community** of super kind, supportive, badass warrior kratom quitters

\-**Being back to working out** (I had to take a couple days off due to exhaustion) and being able to feel my muscles working on a whole new level

\-**My mental clarity** is sooo good! Yesterday I was so creative and got so much done. I'm starting my own business and my mind was so full of ideas and I was so excited!

\-**That I only wasted 7 months taking kratom** and 1 more month (so far) tapering and quitting. I don't ever want to waste more than that on this stupid drug, so the only way to go is forward.

Another thing, I thought kratom helped with my social anxiety but it made it so much worse, I felt so much better answering questions this time around, I don’t overthink every little thing I do as much, and my motivation is coming back more and more each day. I’m feeling really proud of myself for keeping this up and not substituting this addiction for another, I just am really happy about how things went. I’m not feeling regret every second of the day, there’s still times where I feel terrible and feel the need to escape, but there’s no way I’m ever going back to my old life I promise, my whole family and girlfriend see such a difference in how I’m acting, I’ve put on 20 pounds since the quit, which is a lot, but I was very light to what I was before, almost all of my muscle is back to where it was prior to kratom (very into working out) and it’s just getting better and better. Yeah there are very long and tiresome days ahead, but I’ve gotten this far, I know that no one can stop me. I’m finally taking charge and doing shit for me, and no one else.

No ones gonna help you but yourself, and I’m still fighting now, but there has been countless positives since quitting kratom. If you’re on the fence about quitting, just do it. Better to quit now than dragging it on. Tapering wasn’t working for me, and I just wanted to be off of it. The first few days are the worst physically, but by a week most of the symptoms were minor.

My step kids just emerged from their dad getting divorced a few months prior, and I couldn’t do that to them, twice in a year.  I came here for support and I got it, when I started quitting my wife and I weren’t talking at all.  Today we cuddled on the couch and i realized how far gone I was.  Cue tears.  

I tapered down starting with a detailed plan and proportioned doses.  It went good for a few weeks, but after a big disagreement I went back hard, taking doses up to 20g at once.  I was self destructive.  I think I was suicidal at this point.  

My 3 year old looked at me 3 weeks ago and said “I don’t want you and mommy to be mean to each other any more.”  That was it.  I recommitted you my quit day and here I am, last day of the taper.  

Tomorrow is my first day without and I’m so ready I might just jump today, skip my bedtime dose and get on with it.  

Tapering was really strange.  Some days I was fine taking less.  A few days I felt like I was fully in withdrawal whether I took my doses or not. Emotions are wacky, but I missed them and welcome them back.  

My creativity is rebounding, and I’m starting to notice all these things I was ignoring, like hygiene, cleaning up my messes, giving my pets more love, and making sure I show all the people I love how much I appreciate them. 

I’m ready to come out of this stronger than ever.

This time was the worst. Sunday a week ago at 9 am both my friend and I took an identical 10ml liquid Green Maeng Da kratom shot that we bought at my favorite local tobacco shop and within 12 minutes we were both in psychosis, hallucinating and my mind and brain were going in and out of reality. I was SICKKKKK and so was he. At the EXACT same time. I said ""OMGOODNESS. I think something is happening! I can't think right!"" He said ""something happened!"" Neither of us had EVER experienced ANYTHING like that before in our lives. It took several hours for this ""RUSH HOUR"" feeling to stop. The spinning to STOP. I FINALLY passed out for 4 hours. When I woke up, I felt normal, only to get up and within minutes the psychosis started happening again. I made the decision THAT DAY to stop kratom FOREVER.  I poured every bit of powder I had into a bowl and burned it in my fire pit, feeling if ONE CONCENTRATED ""SHOT"" could cause me to feel that way, WHAT were these little doses multiple times per day DOING TO MY BRAIN little by little??? I've been experiencing all the normal side effects.  The bubble-gut, bad belly gurgle,  diarrhea, nausea, head thump, irritability, sneezing like crazy, but I just want to encourage those out there that it is SO WORTH THE QUIT. IT doesn't last forever. Just MAKE IT THROUGH the day. And then tell yourself the next day the same thing.  It will be just a memory before long and you won't have to worry about dosing on the road, running out anymore, spilling that crazy green powder everywhere or explaining to anyone what KRATOM is. Just be done with it. Be free. P.S. This is my first post here ever. Much love to everyone in this group. STAY STRONG! KEEP SHINING!",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54448086}"

I used to use this thread quite a bit, having quit in December (got back from a detox center 2 days before Christmas! It was hell). Well I got on the Vivitrol shot after detoxing, and things were going fairly well for a while. But then I was laid off from my job I just got in January after being unemployed for months. And then I got a letter from my doc in March saying that there would no longer be in-person visits, so there went my Vivitrol safety net. I stayed relatively strong for a couple of months, slipping a couple of times briefly, the second time my bf caught me. He was ANGRY. We have a very healthy and great relationship, I had never seen him this disappointed and angry with me. It scared me and I stopped.

Fast forward to the end of June, and I had really intense suicidal ideation issues. My brain was completely held hostage by the idea of drugs to get me out of this funk. So I started back up again, saying I'd only do it for a week max, well now it's been 2 months.

My therapist and my peer supporter both know what's going on, but I haven't told my bf (that I live with). I am terrified of losing him, and it doesn't help that we are going to move across the country in 3 weeks, so I don't want to stress him out too much. He just doesn't understand that relapse is normal, and I fear that I could lose him if I told him. I have always been so open and honest about my addiction issues, and it feels weird to be back in the closet.

So here I am, turning to you guys so that I can feel a little less alone in this. I am actually in relatively a good space dose-wise compared to what i was taking last year - last year I was at about 90 gpd, and this time around I max it at 20 gpd. I've been trying to taper, and days that I've been good about it I've only taken about 11 gpd. So withdrawals shouldn't be as bad as last time, at least.

I have never succeeded in a taper, so any advice on keeping with it is appreciated. A big incentive I have this time around is that Kratom seems to really be fucking with my health - my blood pressure keeps going through the roof with it, especially by the end of the day, and I have had such bad neck tension that it makes me dizzy and feel unable to breathe. I got some muscle relaxers for it, which is helping, but damn, why is kratom doing this to me this time? The one difference I know is that I'm no longer on an SSRI, which may have been holding my anxieties/tensions at bay. It's very very scary though when it gets really bad, and seems to be much worse when I take higher doses.

I was so hopeless and in severe physical pain with no real help from doctors. I was close to just ending it all.

So I started shoveling 30 grams of Kratom down my throat every day, and this went on for 2.5 years.  


1 year in to use I developed a weird heart swoosh sensation that happens once in a while, doctors claimed it was harmless after wearing a holter monitor.

1.5 years in to use I noticed worsening of some existing cranial nerve damage in my face, which makes talking a bit more difficult.

Through these problems I STILL KEPT USING 30 grams per day.

Then at the end I developed worsening of my underlying neuropathy symptoms due to dopamine deficiency.

And I also got these new eye floaters which I pray to god go away.

So now I have quit and am confronting all of the guilt of doing this to myself.

I destroyed my body originally by substance abuse really with Vitamin B6 - and then I go and do the same thing AGAIN with this herb that I viewed as ""harmless"".

I also have Anxiety/OCD/Paranoia/Verbal Tics that I developed near the end of my use.

I also worry about:

1.) Brain damage from constant Kratom use

2.) Did I impede healing of my underlying condition by abusing Kratom?

I'm sure that both are PROBABLY true.

Hopefully the brain damage will only be mild, and similar to how nicotine addiction likely damaged my brain in the past.

As far as healing of my damaged nerves - I'm sure it probably was not good for them.

Now I am a pit of complete despair and feeling hopeless again and it feels like I'm going through all of the same guilt from what I originally did to myself with energy drinks.

However, im going through these WDs and it's rough to speak out loud at all. I'm afraid that if I can't keep it together, I will lose my job.

I'm trying to hang on to the thought that my health and happiness comes first - but I'm struggling with feeling guilty. I don't know specifically know what I'm asking for here - I guess, should I be feeling guilty for simply trying to *survive?* Or am I not pushing myself hard enough? I can barely be to be here right now, let alone be productive. I hate this.

Well sleep was okay. I'm normally getting down for 3 to 4 hours. Then waking up a lot until the alarm goes off. It's better then being up all night.

Otherwise I would probably give Oscar the Grouch a run for his money today. I'm in a piss poor mood. Want this to move faster but I know that only time will heal. Grumpy and not wanting to be bothered. This is the turning point where your a week out and your brain is telling you, just have some kratom today, be happy and get back off tomorrow. 

Frustrating to say the least. The chill mornings of fall have arrived. I'm the type of person who would rather have 98 degrees rather then 65 degrees. The unexpected need for a jacket to go to work probably kicked the grouchiness up a bit.

I’m still in that place and my resolve is even stronger, but I have a few updates I want to share, and would appreciate any insight and advice from the community.

I’ll be entering an outpatient program on Monday of next week.  The program I’m joining follows a suboxone/cold turkey model.  I’m nervous about the cold turkey aspect of this, though eager to be off the green dust.  I am a little bit nervous about the suboxone as I’ve heard mixed reviews.  Some say it’s a miracle drug that does wonders for eliminating cravings and helping ease (or in some cases outright eliminate withdrawal.  Others say it’s more difficult than kratom to wean off of.  Any advice for using suboxone?

I am also nervous about the sleep aspect of withdrawal in particular.  The program I’m joining asks all participants to be free of all mind-altering substances.  While I feel pretty strongly I don’t have an abuse problem with either substance, I regularly use alcohol (typically one beer each night) to relax and use cannabis every night to help me sleep (I started using cannabis when I decided to get off of ambien — a god-awful drug — several years back).  So, I don’t yet have any fucking clue how I’m going to sleep for at least the first few nights.  But the program does have a medical component so maybe there is something non-addictive they can give me to at least get through the more difficult nights.

I have to say to everyone how much I appreciated the responses I received to my previous post.  I do not post on reddit often, so this was such a needed reminder that there is a community of folks out there who have been in my shoes — in many cases, in much more difficult situations than I’ve ever been in.

This cycle was 15 gpd for past 10 months. Have used on an off since 2015 but slipped up this time not taking proper breaks. Brain fog and memory issue on top of ""not feeling it"" anymore plus dosage getting to my pre-determined danger zone meant it was time to stop.

Day 6, yesterday, there was finally sunshine outside. It definitely helped raise my mood. I was able to get a decent nights sleep. Late evening I started to become very aware of my mind and body being present. My brain was all over the board with signals ranging from why do i feel this way, i shouldn't be this aware, I shouldn't be this happy, I should take something to offset the natural high that I'm getting. Two friends had come by to hang out and watch football. Thus the anxiety was that nervous energy of hanging out without being on some kind of substance. My brain is telling me this shouldn't be possible, you need to be on something to be socially present. I imagine this is going to be my biggest struggle for the next few months as I except the new norm. Again I gave up alcohol few years back as I replaced it with Kratom. I don't intend to bring it back into my life anytime soon.  Using BSO once in morning and once at night.

My goal is to get back to sober socializing and being okay with it. Not letting my brain whisper that I shouldn't have that as an ability unless I take something.

Day 7 Today, woke up with what I would call the Monday back to work blues. I wanted another day off to spring board into another good day. There is mild frustration in my mood and a bit of adhedonia. Thankfully no anxiety currently. Appetite is still hit or miss. I will get hungry but start eating and I lose interest.  I'm once again aware I'm not taking a supplement anymore. I'm present but not high or using anything to make me feel. Energy is still low. I'll know more when the clock hits 7 pm tonight. I have crashed every night at this time since stopping Kratom. Except for one night I used Noopept and Choline which allowed me to find some energy to hang out with friends later into the night.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44452542}"

The problem for me is that Kratom is starting to have negative effects on me (mood swings, irritability), but I still struggle to motivate myself to keep clean. I am currently 12 days clean, and I feel 90% ""normal"". The problem is that this ""normal"" is not enough, at least anymore. Kratom gave me a glimpse, of what is it to live life without anxiety, to be able to do things, that other people do with ease, and even enjoy. Now, after two years of daily kratom use, I start to remember, why I started it. Yes, I can function, do whatever needs to be done, but I don't enjoy almost anything involving other people. I've had a lot of friends during my life, but never felt at ease with anybody. Never felt that connection people are talking about. Not even with my closest ""friends"". Well, until I got on kratom for the first time. The first time I took it, I met a female colleague at work, and we started talking. At some point I realized, that I don't struggle to keep the conversation, even more I ENJOY it, which was something unheard of. That made me take kratom on the next day and on and on... I even get a better job, only because I wah kratom high at that period. I know that most of you would say to go to therapy, but 1st that's not an option here, and second the main idea of CBT (for example) is to learn to live with anxiety, and not pay attention so much. Well I've lived that way for more than 20 years, not knowing that I suffer, pushing through evening instead of just enjoying my life. My anxiety has never been so bad to prevent me from living, but rather steals the enjoyment of living. It is like having a headache for all of your life, without knowing, and then with kratom you suddenly feel... calmness... ""non pain"", but at a price of addiction. The pharmaceutical treatments of anxiety are not better than kratom, I 've tried xanax, and SSRIs, both, apart from being addictive, had pretty bad side effects. And the anti anxiety effect was more like drinking (brain fog), while kratom makes me feel, ""happy"" with myself, content ... ""normal""? I 'am starting to feel (or rather convince myself) that the opioid system of my brain is somehow defective, and needs that extra endorfine boost. Before Kratom, I became addicted to running, to the point of injuring myself, just to feel, the runner high, which felt not like ""high"" but more like normality to me. Is there anybody else, who feels that Kratom gave them too much, to just swipe it out of your life, which makes it harder to just quit?",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43307975}"

Feeling like I've lost an identity,"I took opiates for the latter part of my teens and early twenties. Then I went on suboxone for around 6 years. At 27 I got off that completely for about 6 months before trying kratom. I've also been prescribed Klonopin throughout this ordeal and more recently adderall (and Lexapro!) 

I went off the kratom for a while at the behest of my wife, but started it again after we almost decided to divorce (not kratom related). I feel shitty for taking it again. I don't feel like I get the highs/lows I ever got with harder opiates, but I think my brain just clings on to any sort of stimulation to the opioid receptors.

All of this has led to a feeling of identity crisis. I don't know what I like. I don't know what *I'm * like. I never developed many close relationships and I don't have many hobbies. My late teens and 20s were so heavily marked by drug use that it defined that period. I still worked, I went to college (and dropped out). I never stole or did anything truly horrible to support that habbit. But I look back at that time knowing I was a bad person due to prioritizing finding opiates over friends, family, and romantic  relationships.

Now I find myself at 32, recently having gotten a pretty good job in a newish career. My wife and I have our problems, but I love her. We have a beautiful daughter and another one on the way. I see that I have so many things to look forward to but I feel like I struggle to look at life objectively in the way a non addict would.

I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist who wants me to get off the Klonopin (she just doesn't like benzos for long term use and after a decade on them in inclined to agree)

So now I find myself quitting Klonopin, trying to quit kratom, all while feeling completely alone.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5512916}"

What I wrote in my journal will be in quotes. My commentary, if any, will be in parenthesis.

**Day 6:**

* ""3:30am: Ibuprofen. Back really hurting this morning... more so upper-back... like I slept on a lump or something.""

* ""About 4 hours sleep last night, from ~11pm - 3am.""

* ""Yesterday was the toughest day so far mood-wise. Pain wasn't great, but it was manageable.""

* ""4:30pm: 6 full days!""

* ""6pm: Ibuprofen.""

* ""12am: Ibuprofen.""

* ""NEED SLEEP!!!""

**Day 7:**

* ""Start of Day 7!""

* ""5:50am: Yesterday was better than Wednesday (the day before), except at one point I snapped at my wife. But earlier we sat in the sun with the dogs. It was nice. Felt good. Physically, back felt better than it has in a long time. But, I took Ibuprofen 3x in 24 hours. Not good. Watch that. Took a 1 hour nap yesterday afternoon. Slept 4 hours straight last night (~1am-5am). PROGRESS!""

* ""4:30pm: 7 full days! 1 week ago was my last / final dose. I truly suspect I *might* try kratom again, but I kinda' hope I don't. (This was true for me at the time. Now, I absolutely don't ever want to see, smell, touch or ingest kratom in any form what so ever, EVER AGAIN!) Pain has been about 2 - 3 (out of 10) most of the day. Awesome! Thank you! Try to wait until at least 7pm to take Ibuprofen. None so far today.""

* ""7:15pm: Ibuprofen, after eating.""

* ""2:10am: 'Sleep3' tablet. Can't sleep."" (These tablets only worked for me if I took them once or twice a week. The second night would always be ineffective if I tried taking it two nights in a row. That's how Melatonin works, as I understand it.

I started dragging myself through work. And here I am. Taking caffein every day. Then the nerves kicked in. And I had left my last 40gm bag of Kratom at my girlfriend's place. I was there the other day and just picked it up and stashed it in my bag. I came home yesterday morning and then took some. For no reason. And I felt sick and numb. I remembered why I hated it. I got up again this morning and took another 2-3 spoons. Felt nicer this time. I remembered why I started using it. Didn't feel like puking. But it went away soon enough and I had to take more again. This is how I got hooked to pills again. I was clean and one day I just decided to take one 50mg Tramadol since I was going to the dentist. Continued to take them for years again. I still have my other stash of pills lying at my girlfriend's place. Why? I feel like a deadbeat. I was doing well and kicking ass at school (doing my post grad). Getting good grades. But why did I do this. I know what I need to do but yet I come here. Looking for someone to tell me what I need to hear. Please help me. I feel like its compulsive. I should have gotten rid of my stash. But instead I got it back home. If I were being honest to myself right now (I am a little buzzed), I feel like I will keep using it till this bag of Kratom runs out. And then? Withdrawals again and the cycle continues. I got free from all this shit after such a miserable time.

This reminds me of something we would do in meditation. When our mind wanders, we come back to the focus of our attention. We don't get angry or annoyed at the nature of our monkey-mind. Our mind is untrained and always wandering. We just put the reps in. Just come back to focus. Each time. Without reacting. Without hating. Without judgment.

In March of this year, I underwent Ibogaine treatment in Mexico. At the time, I was about 2 years deep into a 30 gpd habit. On top of that, I was heavily abusing amphetamines. I am happy to say, that I haven’t used Kratom or amphetamines since treatment. I can’t express enough to anyone still struggling how amazing it is to be free of that terrible substance. 

I also want to stress to everyone how important a recovery program is. We are addicts, and our issues run deeper than the surface level addiction to any particular drug. About a month after Ibogaine treatment, I started drinking. I drank heavily for about 2 months before going into a rehab facility. Currently, I have 90 days clean from any mind altering substance. I go to an AA meeting every day and I work the steps. 

I say all of this just to remind anyone who may be considering Ibogaine treatment. It DOES work and gives you a great head start, however, a recovery program is essential in sustaining long term sobriety. 

Good luck to everyone still struggling. On the other side of this seemingly impenetrable wall is a life that is happy, joyous, and free.

Pretty much daily with no more than a few days without every so often. It’s typically been 36 GPD, but within the last few months, I’ve exceeded that drastically. The month before last, I was averaging 45 GPD. This last month, I’ve been averaging 63-72 GPD. At 36 GPD, I was dosing 9 grams every 4 hours. At 45 GPD, I was dosing 9 grams every 3, and at 63-72 GPD, I was dosing 9 grams every 2 hours. I’m aware of the “ceiling” effect Kratom has, but I was too stubborn to believe it.

 On 9/11 I thought I took what would be my last dose at 11 PM, and since then, I’ve been through absolute hell (e.g. the runny nose, the watery eyes, the lack of sleep, the cold chills, and the constant sweating). These symptoms were (barely) bearable throughout the day, but the lack of sleep is seriously taking it’s toll on me. Tonight, I decided I couldn’t take it any longer, but I’m still here for a reason. I want to be done with this, and I am determined to do so. Unfortunately, I’ve already relapsed with a 9 gram dose just over two hours ago simply for the sleep I know it’ll give me. If I only dose at 9 grams a night, will this still be an effective taper considering my recent habit? I know I’ll still be experiencing withdrawal symptoms by the morning, but will it all be for nothing if I continue dose only at night? Would it still be an effective taper since I’ll be going from 72 GPD to 9 GPD? My plan will be to go full CT on 9/21. Will my withdrawal symptoms be as severe as they were these past two days, or will I be seeing at least some improvement?

 I’m making this post because I know it’ll give me some form of accountability, and I just informed my significant other of my problem. Thus giving me a second form of accountability. I want this more than anything, but the lack of sleep is taking more of a toll than the other withdrawal symptoms. I know sleep will still be hard to come by, but I’m hoping not to the extent I’m currently experiencing. For once the CT begins, I’ve procured eight, one mg doses of alprazolam which I will be using solely for sleep and only when absolutely necessary (i.e nights before work when I absolutely cannot fall asleep).

You all are so awesome, and coming on here everyday to read the posts (both positive and negative) really got me through. Love you guys! I'll share a little about my journey below.

 I had been taking 20+gpd for 7 months. I tapered for 3 weeks and then jumped off at 5gpd a week ago. Even though it seems my use was on the lower end of things, it still wasn't fun. The whole month of quitting I felt like I was operating at about 50% in terms of mental power, motivation, and sleep. But I started to get flashes of real energy and feelings and my horrible sluggish brain fog cleared up almost immediately which was enough to keep me going.

When I jumped off the taper, I basically felt like I had a flu (sneezing, chills, body aches, exhaustion, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, etc). It started around 24 hours in and went til about day 5. The insomnia really got me down. I got about 4 hours of sleep per night (I took Xanax a couple of the nights). I  would wake up with this awful feeling of dread and no matter what I did I couldn't get comfortable. My whole body felt like it was vibrating from the inside out (is this RLS? Anxiety?)

Slowly things are getting better. My body still aches...but last night I got 7 hours of sleep without Xanax! It was the best 1 week sober present I could have ever gotten. And I'm starting to realize all the things kratom took away from me while I was too busy chasing the high to notice.

My skin looks amazing and the dark circles are gone from under my eyes! My creativity levels are higher than ever. I feel like being social again. My head is so clear. I've actually been hella productive throughout my quit and I can take credit for 100% of it instead of thinking I got it done thanks to kratom. My mood has been super positive throughout all of this. I know I'm not out of the waters yet but I'm happy to be where I'm at. I'm proud and thankful to myself for making this life changing decision before wasting another day with kratom.

Well, it didn’t really mess me up, taking 5mg every 24 hours to sleep for 6 nights got me moving, feeling better, and just let my body heal some. I went from explosive diarrhea and throwing up with zero energy to functioning. I had to get my house and boys ready for virtual learning so I don’t regret it. I didn’t take one Thursday night and didn’t sleep, little jitters, but made it through Friday’s virtual learning with the boys and was not feeling great Friday night, but got some Gabapentin and felt almost normal again along with CBD joints and herb. Have slept 6 hours the last two nights and just feel so much better! Even have had great sex with my girlfriend since Friday night. Not saying everyone should take a Percocet, I’ve had 10 years of experience with various opiates due to a broken spine that I got fixed with surgery and stopped everything. I knew it wouldn’t make me hooked on them and it only caused one uncomfortable night and day which may have been much better if I had gotten my hands on Gabapentin sooner. Quitting Kratom has been harder for me than opiates because quitting them only took a week, I’m on day 20 and have only felt good since 2 nights ago. Probably was worse going from 70gpd to 0, but I just wanted to stop and not taper. All I know is I feel pretty darn good and am getting better each day. I highly recommend Gabapentin, was a game changer. I feel alive again, and look forward to being 100% again. Everything feels better, music sounds better and gives me chills again.

I have only spoken to one person who knows OF it but has never taken it. The first time I was addicted (several years ago) I kept everything to myself and suffered in silence. It led to more isolation and more psychological turmoil from within. Others who are reading this, I encourage you to tell everyone you can about your kratom addiction - even if it freaks people out it can allow you to talk about your withdrawal and lead a more open life during the process of recovery.

Earlier this week I quit a pretty mild kratom habit that I'd picked up around 6 months ago, dosing daily with no breaks of any sort.

I really believed I was an exception and that the honeymoon period was a thing that only applied to irresponsible users who killed kilos quickly.

Predictably I was wrong and eventually my doses satisfied less and less until any euphoria was just replaced with agitation and irritability.
The magic was gone but my habit wasn't.
My days would revolve around each and every dose, with everyone and everything else becoming an afterthought.

Eventually enough was enough and I went cold turkey, cue 5 days of absolute guilt and many teary breakdowns.
It wasn't the nausea, aches or flu-like symptoms that hurt, but the mental baggage of having to relearn what it is to feel something instead of being in a numb bubble of ignorance. 

Days took forever to go by, the week becoming a bigger test of will than what I'd expected.

Now on day 6, I am feeling much better and actually have the motivation to live life and can appreciate the small things and the connections I have with others. Ultimately, that connection is all we have for sure and addiction is the polar opposite.

But the issue isn't so much the withdrawal, but the complacency that comes with the good times in the first place.
At least with withdrawal I am occupied.

Sober and with everything to lose, the idea of using again recreationally is becoming increasingly attractive as the days go by.

I'll start with a more important part of this journey in case you don't read all of this.

You should be asking yourself, why do I want to quit kratom? Why does part of me want to continue taking kratom? The surface reasons are rarely what motivate us to make these choices.

Yes, withdrawals are awful. Cravings are hard. Boredom, irritability, it sucks. I find however that for me it wasn't actually the desires to cease these negative affects and to feel stimulated that were the deeper reason I chose to use it.

&#x200B;

I loved Kratom. I loved feeling stimulated and high every minute of every waking hour of my life. I loved being free of the nightmare that was alcohol and medications and other drugs. It helped me with physical pain and to get through life too. Even though I had my own rationalizations about 'microdosing'(which was a lie) there was no other reason for me controlling my dosage or cutting back on it at all other than to get a better high on my next dose.

But deeper down, Kratom functioned as more than a high. It helped keep anxieties at bay. It helped mitigate some feelings of insecurity. Even deeper down at the core, I found there were two real reasons for my choice to continue to use it. The first was that I was afraid to stop taking it, because I couldn't picture what life would look like without it. The second, the real reason, is that Kratom numbed my emotional pain. And in a way, the numbing from Kratom itself, it hurt. All the time it hurt. But I liked it. I liked the way it hurt because it felt like something.

&#x200B;

I don't know you or if you have a problem with drugs/kratom. But if you do have an ongoing battle with it, I would look at what your deeper reason is at the heart of that choice, what it is you're fighting against. The second part, and the important part that I've learned about anything, is that people just choose the best option.

When I finally stopped drinking alcohol, it wasn't because it had destroyed my life, relationships, sanity, self. The real reason was far simpler. It did do all those things I mentioned, but the real truth is I stopped drinking because alcohol stopped working. I couldn't get a buzz anymore. So I look at myself and I can see, there's no fairy tale in which I rose up strong and overcame alcohol, that might be the story I tell myself, but in reality it just stopped working so I had to find a better option.

For me personally with quitting kratom, it was that I realized I wanted to heal. I wanted to feel. And I wanted to feel my own pain. I was tired of feeling it hurting me and not being able to access it. I used kratom in order to feel, and eventually the idea of quitting (which now meant for the first time being entirely off drugs) was the option that in my head was, ""maybe I can feel even more if I stop taking it. Even better.

With my other reason, being afraid of what life would look like without it, I became curious and interested in wanting to know what it would be like, and a bit excited, and that desire to know overcame that fear.

So in a way I didn't really quit kratom, I just pursued something I thought was better and more worth it to me. My advice for getting off something, is pursuing something you want even more in your life. Maybe that's a practical reason like saving money, or something deeper like searching for happiness, love, god, facing your insecurities..or even pursuing the question of what you should pursue..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That's all I have to say on quitting. There's some things I found later I wanna share though.

First, most of the ""high"" I thought I was getting from kratom continued after I stopped taking it, but that could just be a me thing from doing many drugs.

Next, I didn't know what real sobriety was like. I had pictured in my mind that the world of a sober person is like this cold harsh reality where everything is fixed and concrete and people wear suits and everything is ""normal"". To my surprise, reality sober is definitely still crazy as fuck. It might even be less stable than it was with drugs.

Next, as my heart begins to unfuck itself, it opens, I feel a lot of good feelings, and, my pain. The pain kratom was masking, it's here. it hurts. it gets better.

Next, I'm way better equipped sober to face some insecurities, face myself, work on issues like confidence if I need to.

Next, I thought kratom was helping me function, nah. It was destroying my ability to visualize things in my imagination. It was reducing the creativity in my dreams.  My ability to write and think coherently suffered in ways I couldn't see. Now, I am watching all of these slowly rebuild themselves day after day and that becomes worth it to stay sober is to watch these abilities come back as I work on them.

Next, my mood is far more stable being sober.

Sleep is still hard, especially with a lot of physical pain.

Lastly as you've heard I'm sure, experience is all in the mind, you can have far more powerful experiences without drugs than you can with them.

I quit cold turkey from my 50 gpd 5 year use. I feel good. Physically I am tired & I am working really hard not to let myself give into depression. Ive struggled with that my whole life & I know it has played a major role in my substance abuse issues. There is so much going on with covid & I can't even go outside for my usual daily walks because of the smoke from the wild fires. 

I've been listening to music non stop & trying to keep myself busy by cleaning & working out (well only 1 time, lol). For me taking one 10 mg THC candy a day has helped alot as well as avoiding alchohol since I quit drinking, Im also taking my usual medications.

I do feel stronger mentally this time.  Since I've quit I've been feeling more & am capable of more enjoyment & appreciation than while on Kratom. The thought of giving up & getting kratom isn't as appealing as it was last time I quit. 

All I know is that I am myself now & I have to be okay with that & stop numbing myself to life's ups & downs. As many people on here have said ""embrace the suck"". I owe it to myself, my boyfriend & my amazing son. They deserve 100% of me & not some doped up, numbed out zombie version of myself.

I really need support with this. I feel alone in my struggle against quitting kratom because, I am alone. I want this to change so I’m first going to put myself out there, talk about my struggle and ask for advice. I started doing kratom early this year.

I would do around 15g per day on average. It was nice because I could do it anywhere: during class, during work and while hanging out with people and function 110%. But I really felt it taking control of me. I started planning my days around the sessions, and figuring out how to keep it with me when I went away to places. Then I made an effort to quit for the first time, and was successful, considered it done after a week. But, I had a hard day at work and slumped into another kratom routine when I discovered the extract. 

Finding the extract marked the second phase of my kratom addiction. I did about a bottle a day plus another 8g every day for the majority of the summer. I was able to quit for a week of vacation, but I went right back to it when I came home. Then I had a day where I tried a new kind of extract and it had the weirdest effect on me emotionally - instead of high I felt guilty, distant and insane altogether. I slowed down and stopped taking extract after that odd day, but my habits went to doing about 16-20gpd. Then I visited my family again and it felt horrifyingly similar. So I tried quitting CT after that day. I lasted about 3 days before I relapsed again. I’ve been going back and forth between resolving to quit CT and getting past the withdrawal symptoms and relapsing for the past two weeks. This past weekend, I made it past some withdrawal symptoms and lived fine for most of the week, but then I had too much to drink a few days ago and it made me decide to get back into it so I bought another bottle of capsules. I threw them away and now I’m trying to quit again. 

I need help from a community like this. I can’t do it myself anymore. I’d love advice for helping win the victory of recovery. I have questions for you guys too. What are some of the things that help you when you overcome the cravings that kick in and your brain starting to say “let’s find a way to get high on kratom”?",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5111388}"

I don't remember exactly. I - regrettably - spent much of the past year taking a ""rainbow"" variety that contained 11 different strains. Deciding that was too much, I changed to white bali for a month or so...until, one month ago, I had a REALLY bad ""panic attack"", or something similar. I promised myself that night that I was quitting - period - and I did. Tomorrow, Sunday, will make one month.

But here's the thing. I'm now having mental health issues the severity of which I've never experienced before. I've now - just in the past week and a half - gone back on several medications I'd left off of for years; Zoloft and Seroquel). I have always had anxiety/depression issues, but had largely controlled them on my own the past few years (or, I suppose, with kratom).

How am I feeling now? I feel, completely at random, as though a wave of EXTREME irritation/agitation spreads throughout my body. I feel INCREDIBLY irritated much of the time, so much that I swear I can physically feel it in my chest. My heart does pound, and my ears ring; usual ""panic attack"" stuff, but the weird ""agitated"" feeling is the worst part. It's like acid throughout my body (or some chemical pumped by my brain that causes anxiety/agitation), it's absolutely maddening; I just want it to go away. I could barely sleep at all until the Seroquel, but last night, I lay in bed and the exact same feeling came over me again despite the Seroquel. Beta blockers - that I've taken for years - have absolutely no affect on it. Neither has avoiding all caffeine or stimulants; and it doesn't seem to be in response to any specific/direct event or stimulus. And even when it ""calms down"", I'm generally left with a headache.

I'm feel like I'm going crazy; literally. I've been to a general practitioner thus far, who was able to put me back on the afore-mentioned meds, but I'm very close to a visit to a psychiatrist, which will be pretty costly. Does this sound similar to what anyone else has experienced before? I've had panic attacks in the past, but NOTHING as bad as these. It's debilitating, I wake up dreading that feeling coming back.

Tapering is still my plan- I realized just how irritable this shit makes me when I take too much. I’m letting myself fall and not be hard on myself- this is part of the process. So normally my tapered dose doesn’t get me high but it’s just enough to keep me feeling normal. And I feel like taking less kratom has me getting more of myself back. And the more kratom I take the more I want to drink or constantly have something to alter my moods more than normal. Anyone else feel that way? I’m cleaning my house today and see project after project that regular me would tackle but kratom me gets overwhelmed and shuts down.

2020-09-12 14:17:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/irhp7x/day_65_wow/,Day 65. Wow,"Hello friends, today marks 65 days without Kratom and 37 days without suboxone (used it as a tapering plan). My habit was 30-40 gpd for 5 years. My life is so stunningly different than it was when I was on the sludge. 

I got hired for a really good job on day 5 of my quit and I took it as a sign that I was on the right path. Now I work and feel so much more clear in my head. Kratom robs you of clarity. My memory is at least 3x better than it was before I got off K. My relationships have improved so dramatically I can’t help but be grateful. I feel comfortable in my skin and can be genuinely proud of myself for once. 

I love people again. I’m not uncomfortable talking to co-workers or strangers anymore. I thought Kratom was supposed to solve this, but it really made me more of a recluse. Now I hang out with my friends as much as I can (something id never do with K). I don’t want to waste time anymore with bullshit and I actually want to work. 

The greatest lie we tell ourselves about Kratom is that it is a solution to anything besides maybe severe chronic pain. You think you need it to wake up, to work harder, to tolerate life, to sleep, to eat, etc... but it’s all bullshit. Your brain and body are capable of doing all of this by itself. 

Now when I think of Kratom, I’m scared of it. After everything I went through, I don’t want painkillers of any kind ever again and I mean that. I have anxiety about the thought of trying it again because I know exactly what will happen. I bet if I did it even one time, I’d go through some shitty WDs again. And that feeling is not normal and it’s not fair for me to make myself suffer more than I already have. 

If you go through my account, you’ll see how many times I’ve tried to taper, quit, or admit I had a problem. It took years of trying. YEARS. Now, when I think about the last few years of my life, I’m in shock that no matter what I did, I was either dosing, feeling high, or coming down while trying to live at the same time. 

Idk why, but it stuck this time. Don’t give up hope and PLEASE stop now because your life will get so much better. Get help if you need to, there’s nothing wrong with that. I promise you life is better on the other side. 

Btw, you will suffer if you took as much as me. But, that suffering is something to be embraced, not scared of. It’s something to be proud of and something to accept. And it will be over before you know it. I know that’s INSANE to hear when you are in the thick of it, but it’s true. 65 days have passed already for me and they will for you if you keep going.

Well yesterday quickly went downhill after lunch. Work had a mishap (not my fault but its my job to inspect and clean up the mess). Ultimately this was challenging due to the poor mood. Used BSO right after lunch to try and help my mind. In the end it worked out though it meant I had to stay later at work on a Friday. Once it was time to go I grabbed my keys out of my desk and wouldn't you know it two Kratom capsules 1 g each coming rolling forward from the back of my desk. Thankfully I laughed and looked at it as a mean trick the world was playing on me. I survived the workday and didn't need them. Now was not the time to cave. Maybe 3 hours ago but definitely not now.  Dropped them onto the floor as a knee jerk reaction knowing there is no way I'd use them now. Which made it easy to throw them out.

Energy was sub par to say the least. Was able to get through dinner and have some Kava and chill at night. Sleep was once again sporadic at best. I cut a .25 xanax in half to use around 4 am. I don't know if it helped but I did get some tranquility although mostly tossing and turning till 8 am.  Brain zaps were not to apparent.

Today, Saturday, hasn't been all that bad. Anxiety is at ease. Adhedonia is the main culprit but completely expected so I'm okay with it. Just feeling blah.... I've been able to do some choirs and force some push ups. Really wishing this weather would stop raining. Don't think we've had sun since Tuesday. Caffeine and Amino Acids have me moving better then I expected with the low dose benzo I imagine is helping. No BSO last night or this morning.

To try and keep this short. This log is really helping me want to make it to the next day. If no one reads these thats fine. It is holding me accountable and gives me a sense of success. I can't wait to write that first day where I feel the haze has lifted and I can truly say I'm feeling upbeat.

Good luck out there friends!

I’m wanting to quit my kratom habit but like most am having a difficult time. Earlier on in my life I gave up alcohol, marijuana, any other Rec drugs (I was a heavy drinker at that point) and I remember how difficult it was to adjust to the lifestyle change, but I’m glad I did it. I started taking kratom almost three years ago to help with chronic pain and low energy levels. I’m currently at around 45gpd. 

I’m tired of depending on this stuff to keep me going and I don’t want to be a slave to any substance. Plus the physical symptoms are starting to affect me as well. (Hair loss, gastrointestinal issues)

Anyways, I’m terrified. The reason I haven’t quit is because I am a full time mom to two toddlers, I run my own business and I do not have help from other family members and friends at this point. I just feel like I won’t be able to keep up with my kids and life if I’m dealing with withdrawal symptoms. It feels impossible :(

I know it’s not. And I’m sure a taper would be recommended. I’m going to try that but Tapering generally isn’t a great choice for me because of my addictive personality. 

I appreciate all of you and love seeing the success stories and raw real life experiences on here so I’m happy to have found this forum.

2020-09-12 09:31:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/ircneb/please_know_that_every_kratom_withdrawal_can_be/,Please know that every kratom withdrawal can be very different.,"I'm no stranger when it comes to kratom withdrawal. I have been through it multiple times over a decade. It really can be bad. Don't let anyone try to downplay what you are going through. I'm sorry, it is not like ""stopping coffee"". Not even close. The point of this post is not to tell you that you are exaggerating the pain that you are going through. I've been there and it can be awful. But I also want to tell you about an experience I just had where it wasn't bad. Maybe it will help.

The first few times I started kratom, I would buy quality kratom from online vendors. The stuff seemed really good and if I over did it, the kratom would hit me hard. I would get intense wobbles, hard to focus, hard to physically do things with my hands, etc. When I would quit, the withdrawals were intense. My whole body ached, I would have horrible restless legs and get it really bad in my chest too (this was by far the worst symptom for me), I couldn't sleep for days, and I had absolutely no energy. There was no way I could even perform my daily routine around the house. Mowing the lawn felt like climbing Everest. Work was an absolute no go. I HAD to take at least 3 days completely off life to get off this stuff. And even the next few days after those first 3 days were still bad. I went through this at least 3 times and it was the same every time.

So of course I still ended up getting back on this stuff even after going through this multiple times. It is always ""I'll just take it a few times to help get through this thing going on now, and then I'll stop."" You guessed it, I didn't stop. This time was different though. Instead of ordering from my usual vendors online, I ended up just grabbing the crappy kratom from the local head shops here. I think it was nJoy or something. I started taking a little bit and then after a mont, way usage skyrocketed again. I would still get that kratom ""feeling"" but it wouldn't mess me up like the online kratom if I took a bunch. It was like it stopped working after I took a certain amount. Probably because the quality was not good. I was still taking a bunch though. I'm guessing a minimum of 60 gpd. Having to wake up in the middle of the night to take more. I was right in my old ways.

So I decided I had to stop. I probably don't need to explain why because most of you know what happens when you are dependent on this stuff. I was scared to stop because I knew it was going to be bad. I had no option of taking off work. So I decided to stop on Friday, power through work that day, and us Saturday and Sunday to get through it. So my last dose was at like 2:00AM on Friday. I went cold turkey from 60 gpd. Friday at work I did start feeling bad but I just kept going. All the normal symptoms were there. I finished work and was feeling pretty bad. But by around 9:00pm that night, I started getting tired. As most of you know, this isn't supposed to happen in the first 24 hours. I had some restless legs but it wasn't too bad. By about 11:00pm I feel asleep. I woke up Saturday around 6:00am and actually felt pretty good. I'm sitting here now and really have no major symptoms. I don't understand it. I do feel sluggish but this really is not a big deal. I'm able to function just fine.

I'm guessing this is because I was taking the crappy head shop kratom. I was taking it for at least a year and was taking 60 gpd. This is a lot for me and I only had about 12-16 hours of withdrawal and it was over. This is amazing to me. I'm telling you this because this may be a way to help some people get of kratom. It may suck at first switching from high quality kratom to headshop kratom, but I'm sure it will not be as bad as full blown withdrawal. I'm guessing your body will adjust to the crappy kratom pretty quick. Once this happens, you can start to completely get off it. This is a true story that just happened to me. I can't believe how minor the withdrawals were. I was on it long enough and at a high dose, where it should have been bad. It wasn't though. I've been through it before so I knew what should have been coming. Just trying to throw out some ideas people may use to finally get off this stuff.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5973124}"

Maybe against the rules but I finished up writing a song the other day that represents this willful change in my life and it was therapeutic to let my feelings do their thing.  Music is my blood and I feel like kratom was stealing it from me.  Kratom is a vampire for creativity, even though I thought it was helpful.

Initially I started taking kratom to stop taking painkillers recreationally. Literally no one in my life knows about the painkillers or kratom usage (probably quite a few friends puzzled as to who raided their medicine cabinets in the past), so it’s been a lonely struggle in my life for a long time. It just made me feel OK within myself, something I had never felt before due to heavy social anxiety.

Anyway, since the COVID situation started, my “down the street” shop closed up, which was a real pain in the ass because the quality and price were amazing. Since then I’d been driving 45 minutes both ways across the fucking state line three to four times per week. This had really interfered with my job performance and general anxiety to keep the WD at bay. Not to mention throwing $120-$180 down the drain every single week.

Since COVID it seems that kratom no longer is working for me - the downsides have outweighed the upsides by far...lethargy, not engaged in hobbies anymore, anger issues, and anxiety issues. Plus I’ve been hiding this habit from my wife for ever and it’s super unfair to her - makes me feel like a complete asshole and loser.

I’m at the beach on vacation this week and decided to make the jump CT the night we arrived. It certainly has made the vacation experience a little...different than usual so far, but the thought of WDing while trying to work was not happening.  Tried that many times before and never made it a single day.

So far the RSL has been the real bitch, but it seems to have eased up tonight. Only an hour or so of sleep in the past two days. We shall see. Besides that, the usual symptoms of cold/sweats, runny nose, sneezing, aches, lethargy. Today has been quite a bit better - definitely not 100% but BETTER thank God.

Here’s hoping that I can stay on the train once I get back home. The PAWS haven’t hit yet and I’m kinda worried about them. Right now I feel no need to dose again.

I take 6 capsules a day, 1 per dose every 3 hours or so, the bulk of them in the evening. That’s when I’m the busiest caring for my family cooking cleaning etc... I know I can do this in just scared. I’m scared to give it up. I’m scared of the lack of motivation and being tired. I was a previous opiate addict. I do feel more of myself during the mornings but as I get more Kratom in my system I do get more numb. When I take my afternoon dosage my hands and feet cranp and I have a bit of fluid build up in my ankles. I really hate it but I am having a hard time letting it go.

Let's assume this subject has a fast metabolism and a low BMI.

Let's say Week 1: You dose 20 GPD for 7 days (140 grams total)

Week 2: you lower your dosing to 10 GPD in a taper so 70 grams total.

Week 3: You drop down to 7 GPD for 7 days, 49 grams that week.

At the end of that third week, when you go into finally go into full withdrawal... will the 20/10 GPD daily amounts in the past weeks STILL be accounted in your system? Or would all of that Kratom no longer be built up in your system, thus the withdrawal will be less severe only having to face the mild WD intensity of jumping off at 7 GPD instead of the higher amounts?

I am a recovering opioid addict, and had been clean for several years.  Then I discovered kratom, last August (2019).  I got up to around a 25-30 gpd habit up until December, when my wife — who is aware of my addiction history — found out what kratom is and its similarities to opiates.  I spent around three weeks to a month tapering down and eventually got completely off kratom, but was nowhere near prepared for the length of the withdrawal.  I relapsed around a month later, after swearing on everything I could that I would never return to the drug.  I lost my wife’s trust through this process, but over time earned it back to at least some extent.

After restarting my kratom usage a month after quitting, I continued to hide it from my wife, initially thinking I could control my usage and only use every now and then.  I would like to add my voice to the chorus of other users on this subreddit who have attested to the fact that there is no such thing as casual usage of kratom, especially for recovering opiate addicts like me.  Eventually, the pandemic hit, and the constantly-home nature (along with the stressful work from home environment in which I was operating) of the virus led me to eventually use regularly, initially dosing twice a day for a total of around 11 gpd, working my way up to where I am now, dosing three or four times a day 20-30 grams total.  I knew during this entire seven month period that I would eventually have to pay the piper, fess up, and quit kratom again, and that I could never keep this from my wife forever.  I told her tonight about my relapse, and she was heartbroken over my deception. We are expecting our first child in February, and this — along with the importance of saving my marriage today and in the future — is why I am now bound and determined to get clean once and for all.  But this isn’t my first time, and I now recognize I have to admit I do not exactly know how to do this.  I just know that I can if I work harder than I’ve ever worked at it before.   

I plan to seek help as I begin this process — while I think I am capable of quitting kratom on my own (with support from my closest friends, family, and wife) for a short period of time, I am less confident that I have the tools/understanding to stay clean in the long term.  As an opiate addict, I had always told folks when I talked to them my addiction that I was thankful I was not an alcoholic (I recognize most addicts are addicted to all substances, but while I probably drink too regularly, I do not consider myself an alcoholic) because it’s too easy to access alcohol legally.  Well, kratom turns out to be my worst nightmare.  I can walk ten minutes and pickup as much as I want.  

Anyway, I plan to slowly taper down off the kratom under the supervision of a professional in the coming weeks.  Part of my plan to get clean is to regularly journal about my quitting here on reddit, so here I am.  I hope that expressing my true feelings and thoughts during the detox will both be a release for me and garner support from what is an incredible community of folks who want to rid themselves of addiction to kratom.  I appreciate all of your help in the future - clearly I will need it.  But I am ready and determined this time.  Any advice, pointers, support is greatly appreciated!",25,"{'pandemic': 1, 'virus': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4674995}"

A week ago I was at 60gpd and the last 3 days I’ve been at 45gpd. Jesus I can’t believe I got up to 60gpd...and easily could’ve gone higher but my bank account said otherwise. That jump from 60 to 45 wasn’t horrible. I definitely felt it but it was manageable. I think I’m leveling out and took 1 gram less on my last dose today. I know it’s just 1 gram but it’s ⬇️ and that’s the direction I want to keep going. I’m being easy on myself this time around and keep reminding myself that this is not a race. I didn’t get here overnight and sure as hell am not going to get off of it overnight, unless I jump. The last time I was here I was in a hurry to quit. Not only was I ready to, but I had an upcoming surgery and was freaking out about what negative interactions the Kratom would have with the anesthesia. I was able to get down to 3.5 grams a day and a half before surgery. All went well, I used my prescription meds after surgery only as needed because at that point they really did nothing for me because of my kratom tolerance.

I am preparing for another quit because now, Im in my mid 30's, I lost weight, my heartburn is crazy, I feel and look like horseshit. Everytime, this is what happens. 

Kratom is good for awhile. Then shit starts to happen. Health starts to decline. Start feeling like shit- Plan to quit- then I quit- then 2 weeks to 1.5 mnths in, I have a weak moment, then it is over. 

This cycle has been happening over and over again. Im sure I've decreased my lifespan dramatically from the quit methods I use, the cycle of withdrawals, my body is broken. I've done this so many times, I have a quit kit lined up and ready to go. I do some stupid wreckless shit to avoid the pain. Im just sick of drugs, but I'm not if you know what I mean.

I imagine if I ever stuck with it, it will take me 1-2 years to feel normal, whatever that means or feels like. 

I don't know. I just feel cursed. I have the addict gene, no doubt about it. I have to do this all over again, from 80+ gpd. God help me. My confidence is wrecked from the amount of times I've quit and never could do it forever. It's like, what's the point when I know I'm going to fail?

I've been on that train years past chugging the green sludge daily and going about life like nothing was wrong. Until depression, lethargy, and anhedonia hit and hit hard. So I quit using the help of this community I found.

Fast forward 3 months after that quit and feeling all bright and peachy I decided I could handle my shit and dose every now and then. I will never forget the insomnia of that first quit so I made a pledge to only take once a week.

Things were...working out pretty fine actually for a bit there. I'd chug my crap once a week and sit around noodling on guitar for hours.

 Then came a time I severely messed up my back for work. I walked into that head shop near me seeing if they had anything for 'pain relief'.  The kindly old head shop owner said they had these gold caps see that users tend to be very fond of, ""some even buy these every day!"" Hah that should of been a warning sign, but lo I took those gold devils and felt hella good for a hella long time.

So I switched completely to gold caps and was blessed to not have to chug algae slime once a week. Well this newfound powerhouse of an extract let me slip up a few times and I'd take it twice a week sometimes always watching out for the warning signs of previous dependencies. And they were all there...

Insomnia, depression, anhedonia, phantom never pain, these symptoms visited me throughout the months of this extract use. Whenever I would go a full week without using I would start getting serious cravings and could not resist the urge to buy more. I knew what I was getting myself into and I just let it happen.

So I went on a road trip out west with the intentions that it'd impossible to find any gold out there in the west...it's all gone. Wrong. It's everywhere in head shops nowadays and so I continued my weekly ritual up and down the pacific coast and ending in Colorado. It was there that insomnia hit me...and hard. When I could least afford it to. When I needed to end the trip on a positive note instead of coming back sallow and beaten down. 

So I made a promise to quit. Didn't think it would be that bad I mean I've only used about once a week right? WRONG!!!
This has been the hardest quit by far, insomnia for two weeks followed by major depression, phantom pain, anhedonia, everything! I know how to play the game and that exercise, healthy eating, and meditation is the way to get through these days but man I didn't expect such a pronounced withdrawal.

I'm on day 24 currently and still only sleeping about 3 hrs a day. To those who have moderated their use and are able to, watch the fuck out.

My better half had been using at a similar dose to me for about a year and half and she tapered off and didn’t use the Lucemyra like I did to come off. But she seemed to only have the worst sides for the first couple days without, unlike mine lasting a full week basically.

I definitely feel better being free from the vice grip of this stuff. Never in a million years would have thought it was doing the damage to my body that it was. For the longest time I thought the kratom was helping my aches, pains and various other issues but eventually realized I was no longer benefiting from the tea and only used it to keep from feeling like shit, and that shitty feeling was from the kratom use lol

It’s started messing with my hormones really badly, testosterone, estrogen and prolactin levels especially.. guys don’t need a lot of estrogen and prolactin just FYI lol. Fortunately, I see my PCP and endocrinologist often enough for them to monitor and help with my blood work as I’m also on TRT, which is likely being caused by the heavy prolonged kratom use. We had addressed all the issues causing the hormone imbalances so I did some digging and found a medical research article from 2018 with someone having the exact same issues due to kratom and that’s when I said enough is enough.

I feel like my body is resetting itself which I expected would happen. But my sinuses and my GI tract are going crazy. Does anyone have some insight to make these sides a little better?

Well very jaded sleep last night. A few bathroom breaks and restlessness. Brain zaps anytime I got close to falling asleep. I could feel myself drifting off. Then a complete head to body shudder and awake again. Thankfully its Friday. Got myself out of bed. Grabbed the BSO and a protein shake and forced a half ass workout. I have optimism on my side today. Goal is to not use BSO until bed time tonight. I am a determined sometimes stubborn person. With that said, if  I had not thrown all my kratom away giving in would be so easy right now. If you are going CT, I don't think its feasible to keep any in your home. My saving grace is knowing I have a few .25 xanax set aside if things get really hairy. Thankfully those aren't my thing. The dumb downed couch feeling of benzos give me no pleasure plus the hangover into the next day. Tonight would be the night too use one as I have nothing going on till tomorrow afternoon.

At my worst I was around 30 GPD, but I've dropped down to around this range. I started taking Kratom because it masked my mood/depression, and gave me energy.

**Going without taking a substance everyday is terrifying to me. I don't know how to live without taking SOMETHING.** I used to be heavily addicted to the hardest substances years back, and been through hell and back over and over.

*Kratom in the beginning looked like a promising path* towards a better life. It was a tool to get off of suboxone, fentanyl, pills, crystal meth, you name it. I've put all of those long behind me in the past But now Kratom is just another ball and chain. Another addiction. The first time I felt that warm euphoria I knew It was inevitable it would be just another addiction. **Any substance I take a liking to, I will** redose over and over every single day until it no longer works.

Tomorrow is day 1 with absolutely nothing to calm my brain and it's relentless cravings to take something.

I'm honestly dreading the fact I have to face this, going into it with a bad mindset priming myself to fail and relapse. I know I should try to be more positive, but this is all I know, taking substances to run away from some black hole in my character.

Not fake temporary happy, with the nagging realization that it is fleeting, but a true happiness that is my own. 

Things are INSANE right now. The pandemic, wildfires, work, family life & its tough not to want to turn to kratom again. But I feel now that kratom just made things worse.

I have quit much much harder substances in the past & quit drinking alchohol in November but kratom has been really hard for me. I think what makes this one so hard is the accessibility of it. The fact that you can drive down the street and LEGALLY buy it, at least where I live, that makes it that much harder to quit. And that you can still function on it, sometimes better than without it. 

The other substances I was addicted to before were highly illegal & once I disassociated myself from the people I knew who could get them, I couldn't access it even if I wanted to. 

I'm just trying to remind myself to be patient with myself & everyone in my life at this time. We are all just doing the very best that we can.

(Make sure you check-out our sub's [Taper Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/). I had tried ""planned tapers"" before and failed. With this taper I didn't plan too much ahead (just daily planning really) and went with intuition and how I felt. It's kinda' the opposite of what our sub suggests, so follow the [Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/modquittingkratom/comments/63tjtd/tapering/)  first and foremost.) To keep these posts as short as possible, I'm going to post them over multiple days. What I wrote in my journal will be in quotes. My commentary, if any, will be in parenthesis.

**Day -1 (my second to last day tapering):**

* ""Try 3.5g this evening."" (I was down to one dose per day for 10+ days by this point. I had dosed 4g the prior two days and 5g the two days before that.) ""Withdrawals have been minimal, other than feeling sluggish the previous three days.""

* ""4:30pm: dosed 3.5g."" 

* ""Diarrhea 8 times today."" (This, to me, was a clear-cut sign that I was really close to quitting.)

**Day 0 (the last time I used kratom... although I didn't know it would be at the time):**

* ""Try either 3 or 3.5g again today.""

* ""1:15pm: Only two small BM's so far. They're loose but not diarrhea.""

* ""4:30pm: dosed 3g.""

* ""8:45pm: Ibuprofen. Burning back, hips and upper legs.""

(I forgot to write down how much or how little sleep I got that night. But I'm sure it was 3 hours or less... broken sleep.)

**Day 1 (although I didn't know at the time, this would be my first day actually quitting kratom):**

* ""I *might* try to not dose this evening and see how it goes. Withdrawal symptoms seem almost nonexistent this morning. I also want to see how my back pain is by ~6pm. (My back pain always ramps up in the evening / night.) At the moment (10:45am) it's about a 4 or 5 out of 10. Not bad.""

* ""1:40pm: Took Ibuprofen. Back pain is up to a 7/10. Try not to take Ibuprofen before bed tonight. It's been helping with pain, but it hasn't helped with sleep all week."" (Insomnia started my last week of tapering. Only 2-3 hours sleep per night, if that.)

* ""11pm: 30.5 hours since my last dose! (I napped and slept through what *could* have been another dose. I fell asleep around 4pm and woke about 7pm. The longest nap I had in ages. I realized I missed my 4:30pm dose and I didn't feel too bad. I decided to fulfill my ""*might* try not to dose..."" wishful thinking statement from that morning. And, sort of, ""by accident"" it came true.) Back is much better after ibuprofen and a nap. ~2-3/10, but brain is foggy like that Reddit post I read.""

* ""2:35am: Can't fall asleep yet. Didn't take Ibuprofen before bed. Trying a 'Sleep 3' tablet (a combination of L-Theanine, Chamomile and Lavender Extract, Valerian Root Extract, Melatonin and more).""

**Day 2:**

* ""6:35am: Lousy sleep. 3 hours broken-up at best. Back pain is 8-9/10. I was restless last night. Occasional leg and arm twitches (before I knew what RLS really was). And dreams, when I did sleep. OMG, the dreams! I was always lost or late for something or in some stressful situation. Good news is, 38+ hours since my last dose.""

* ""4:30pm: 48 hours since my last dose!""

* ""7pm: Excruciating back pain came on suddenly! Walking and feeding the dogs was a struggle. Pain = 9/10. Lower back feels like it's ON FIRE! **DON'T GIVE IN! IT PROBABLY WON'T HELP ANYWAY!** Try to wait until 8:30pm for Ibuprofen. Also, **REMEMBER TO DRINK MORE WATER TOMORROW!**""

* ""7:30pm: 51 hours. Thoughts are there. FIGHT IT!""

* ""8:45pm: Ibuprofen.""

Short update: Still experiencing shortness of breath and fatigue. Saw my doctor a week ago and he ran blood work and an X-ray to try and get to the bottom of this but couldn't find anything abnormal. Oddly noticed my lymph nodes have been swelling up under my armpits, neck, chest and groin which caused the doctor to schedule me to come back in on the 17th. Kinda scary but I'm optimistic.Mentally doing a bit better, still pretty anxious and having days of intense depression but for the most part it's manageable.I'll update again once I've visited with my doctor and give an update to how things are going and if I found out anything.  


 Mini update: Haven't been to the doctor yet. I realized that whatever is causing my shortness of breath may be either stomach or throat related. I lean more towards stomach related because I have difficulty breathing into my stomach in general but also after every meal it's a lot more difficult to breathe. As for my throat I just notice a tightness or feeling of something in it which I know all too well is my anxiety. I've decided to self-medicate for the time being by drinking, nothing hard just beer. Night five of drinking, hangovers aren't terrible but the increased anxiety brought by them is somewhat poopy early on in the day. Lymph nodes are still swollen and it probably doesn't help that I've been drinking haha.

Started using Kratom back in 2015. Had a very tough year and accident abroad leading to improper treatment until I arrived back Stateside. That lead me looking into nootropics and/or supplements to calm my anxieties (benzos out of the question) due to the circumstances and getting out of college looking for a job.

Researched kratom heavily before taking the dive. I noted from day one if my dose ever got to 4 grams / the 15 gpd amount it was time to quit for good (take note of this for later in my story). From my reading it sounded like the 15 gpd was the minimum PITA dose to quit from and things start to get hairy at 20 gpd and even tougher above that. My starting dose was 2 grams. I was using on and off over these past years. Never more then 6 months straight with 1 month breaks. That leads me to now. 10 months straight and the dose started around 2.75 grams and quickly got to 3.5 grams per dose. My excuse was it was a caffeine replacement that was giving me an edge. The problem was the edge was wearing off. The brain fog and memory issues were becoming apparent. Tried quitting before 6 months or so but then Covid happened and life became more hectic as my work picked up.

I knew over the past two weeks when the dose of 3.75 wasn't cutting it my days were numbered. Go back 3 days ago and I measured out 4 grams. Took my dose and 30 minutes later it kicked in with the original excitement and happy grin we all know when it starts to work. Instantly I remembered the promise I made myself.

I truly don't have a use for kratom anymore. It was just a habit that originally made things even more grand, but now is a nuisance and unnecessary. Glad to say I dumped everything two days ago. Days 1 and 2 weren't unbearable. Melatonin and CBD has allowed me to sleep at night (I consider this very lucky).

So why am I posting on Day 3? The anxiety and depression came ranging out this morning. I have no reason to feel this way as its a light day at work and things are going well.  Thus it made me realize I need to document this journey for others and my own reminder as to why I am doing this.

I'm very glad I trashed all my kratom as I would of cracked this morning.  Instead I have a bottle of Black Seed Oil on hand. Took 2 tsp and half hour later I've definitely calmed down though a bit on edge. I hope to hold myself accountable with logging this journey.

Some other info, no appetite what so ever. Stomach upset is very real though (many bathroom trips). I'm adding in protein shakes for calories. I've worked out 3 of 4 days this week and plan to stick to at least four days a week to help get me going. Adhedonia is the most difficult struggle for me. I can handle anxiety but its true how Kratom makes you okay with not doing anything. I realized my hobbies have become nonexistent and become okay with sitting on the couch. I really look forward to wanting to get back outside again.

The reason I put winter is coming is I know winter depression is real. I have roughly 75 days to thanksgiving and 100 days till Christmas. I hope to reach those days with Kratom being a thing of the past. Will any lingering effects still exist? I don't know. But this is why I plan to document along the way and keep reminding me of the goals of reaching these holidays Kratom free for the first time in 5+ years.",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49449125}"

It ""works"" in the often cut-throat business world. But does this seemingly trite throwaway line apply to addiction? Does it apply to quitting kratom? In my opinion, no... and yes. It depends on how you look at it.

If you take the words ""quit"" and ""quitters"" to mean the act of quitting kratom and we are the quittERs, then no, of course it doesn't work. BUT, if you take it to mean ""Never quit trying (to quit kratom)... And you will eventually ""win"" (succeed at quitting kratom)"" then yes, by all means, it applies. 

Makes sense to me. (Although, many nonsensical things make sense to me :) The bottom line for me is: Never quit quitting (kratom). Until you've quit. Then you've ""won"".

I love waking up at 7 am with the world and getting stuck in traffic with people rushing to work. I love the feeling of making money. I miss that so much. Kratom helped me tremendously get amazing grades in college. As I was finishing my usage became so high. I was spending more money on kratom than I could afford. The honeymoon phase vanished quickly. I became a lonely girl going to sketchy smoke shops everyday. Now, I am going on job interviews daily. Like I said previously, I have so much money to do so many things to my new car. I have been buying everything that I have wanted these last four years. Put it this way, I did not spend a single penny of my money on anything but kratom. I use to do 6+ shots, on pay day 12. I was almost at 100 gpd!! This second time quitting I was coming off 72-84gpd almost 6-8 shots again!! It was sick!!!!!! I am done with that. Money does not buy happiness. However, having money is helping me do things that make me happy. It helps me feel safe and financially stable. I feel truly great. I have zero symptoms besides trouble sleeping at this point. I am so beyond grateful for this process and all of you. I might not be on here much to answer, but I have read everyones message and have thought a lot about them. I appreciate you all.

I feel as if my mind has been warped.,"To make a long story short, I got hooked on $20 extract shots during my Junior summer in high school. Flash forward two years, I’m taking two a day. Spending about $320 a week. Then I quit. 

Found a cheaper brand of kratom shot. Thought it was knock off and just a herbal supplement because it was so cheap. Sold me one and I was hooked again. It gives me a strange feeling these days. Almost like it gives me the energy to be relaxed, if that makes any sense. 

I have a stressful job dealing with people all day. Good salary but I don’t want this burden of shit to come rain on my parade every day. I just wish I could always be relaxed. I have a bad problem with relaxing, always have. 

When I get home from work, I like to start cleaning up right away, get the house looking damn good, fire up the grill and go to town. I probably take 4-5 extract shots a day, drink two to three beers a night and chief down on my wax pens. I want to go through a full detox (except for wax). But I need to find something to keep my mind calm and collected through my long work day. 

My mind gets bored very easily. I process things too fast is what I’ve always been told. My great grandfather was apparently the same way, and he drank constantly to give his brain something to do. This man built dams and bridges.

My grandfather is the same way, except he channeled his “energy” or whatever into just working on something CONSTANTLY. That’s kinda how I am. Kratom makes me be able to just sit and do nothing, that’s why I love it. 

But I need to stop. I’m tired of waking up every morning and shitting my guts out, or waking up and vomiting white foam shit. I feel like my body is getting fucked. 

I will of course go cold turkey, but does anyone have any ideas that will help me stay stimulated during the first week? After the first week I’m in the gold. 

I’d love to hear some of you guys’ stories or experience quitting. I’ve never thought of the withdrawals as being that bad, I just really wanna get the buzz the entire first 3 days

Went from 40g+ daily for 6 years to about 28gpd now. I feel it’s manageable for sure. Finished packing and painting over the weekend and pre weighed all my doses at 4g. 3 in the am and 4 for the rest of the day. It’s been keeping me from feeling like crap at work or my wife noticing any difference in my behavior. Im going to drop my doses by 1g every 3-4 days. I’m just happy I’m working towards quitting...AGAIN. Third times a charm right? Even had an amazing leg workout yesterday. The gym is necessary for me and has been for years. It keeps me disciplined and keeps those endorphins going. Plus my sleep and eating hasn’t been off much which is awesome. 

   I’ve let this plant run my life for too long. My days revolve around dosing and making sure I have enough. It’ll be nice to have that extra $, it’ll nice to be 💯, and it’ll be amazing to know that I don’t have to hide anything anymore. People on here have been awesome. They don’t judge my situation or anyone else’s. They just want to quit and be free of this. That’s something I can get behind 100%

People understand that. Don't they? Well, if they don't, F 'em!"" That attitude is suddenly no longer acceptable to ME. For me. Myself. No one else.

I harm people with my tongue... my attitude... my sarcasm ""gone too far"". (Don't get me wrong. I love sarcasm. Especially when it's humorous. But once in a while, mine goes too far and goes from humorous to hurtful. I need to recognize when to and how to ""put on the breaks"" so to speak.) I sometimes yell at or am very curt with my wife. I justify it as ""Well, it's the only way she seems to hear me or gets my point."" That has to change. I need to be more patient with others and myself. And I tend to get annoyed by little things. And if I never hear ""Oh that's just ____ being _____. He doesn't mean it."" again I'll be very happy.

Also naltrexone heads up if someone searches the sub.,"This past week sucked. I couldn't have picked a worse time (interdepartmental promotion) but I had to for my family.  I'm an alcoholic and chronically relapse as well and things were just getting worse in that department so I wanted to stay naltrexone this weekend.  That meant kratom had to go asap. 

I was only on maybe 20-30g spaced throughout the day from morning until 4:00 in my water bottle so I thought this was going to be easy. It really wasn't at all. I've detoxed off of alcohol and a few other things in the past and this was very much comparable and I would rather not do it ever again. I don't know if it's that I'm a smaller female, my meds, that I don't eat a lot, or that I drink like crazy and stopped that too. 

The worst is over but I'm still restless and can't control my body temperature.  Night sweats are ridiculous. I'm changing clothes and flipping blankets about 4 times a night. I've lost about 12 pounds in a week with no appetite and don't need to loose any more.  I'm drinking a ton of water and electrolytes but probably still dehydrated. That needs to go away quick. 

However!! My energy is back! I feel happier and very motivated to make positive changes in my life. Getting rid of the jungle juice along with finally having the help to stay sober from alcohol gives me such a peaceful feeling. Instead of coming home and rushing through everything all sped up until I crash into a bottle or a mood I can take my time and enjoy each moment.  

On to the naltrexone bit.  I took my last kratom dose Tuesday morning at 9am. I started the naltrexone stay night at 9pm. 4.5 days is NOT long enough if you want zero side effects.  I had actually felt better that Friday evening and Saturday up until I took the naltrexone, then I felt like I got knocked back to day 2. All that night, Sunday, and up until around noon Monday I felt disgusting. Like day two plus something else. Like my skin was sharp and my head was confused and my eyes were tight. Nothing too crazy like if you took it before even starting to detox. My heart rate seemed fine for the most part. There was digestive distress.  It was just very very uncomfortable and I could tell i didn't wait long enough. It took until tuesday morning for all that to go away.  My Tuesday evening i felt great. If you are going to start naltrexone I would just wait until you're detoxed comfortably before you start it or you're going to go backwards a bit. I was a relatively low doser... so if you are one of those very high dosers thinking about taking it you might really want to wait or you could possibly have even more issues. 

So far no cravings since the weekend for alcohol or kratom, which is actually really amazing and freeing. It's crazy how much time shit like that takes out of your day.

We played with my meds for a little while and I was set to try yet another new pill when a friend gasped in horror when I told her that I had been a daily user of kratom this whole time. Mind you, I knew this was an addicitive substance and knew that it was hard to quit, but I had stayed willfully ignorant about the process of withdrawing. I kept daily using because I was terrified of going through whatever withdrawal process was necessary to get clean. This habit started 2 years and 2 months ago, so I have been in it daily for a long while. Going back to the depression, its onset has been insidious and I totally believe it's related to my slow tapering down. However, I have read that depression is something usually dealt with in the PAWS phase. Is my initial hunch that the depression and the tapering are linked a correct assumption? Going through this slow dive into deeper depression has me rattled a bit, but I have vowed to get through it. Part of me still wants to rip the band-aid off and go cold turkey to get it over with, but I have too much going on in my life to be out of commission for 2+ weeks. If the depression is set to last the entire tapering down, what should I do other than immune system support and take my regular psych meds as prescribed? Thanks for any feedback and I wish you all strength and power as you go through your journey of quitting!",1,{'immun': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55491847}"

I'm almost 7 months sober now and thought I'd share some of my experience from getting free of this shit. It's been quite a journey. Reading these threads brings right back to the first day I decided I was done. If you're experiencing problems with Kratom, consider reading his entire post. I'm going to put a little list of withdrawal solutions at the end.

Firstly, I gotta say that if you think you might have a problem and you're taking kratom regularly or everyday... try and stop while you're ahead. If you get to the point of physical dependence it's not pretty coming off of this stuff. I've detoxed from other drugs before. Adderal, alcohol, cocain... This was the worst of all in my experience. I felt absolutely exhausted for at least three weeks, it wrecked my digestive system, could barely sleep, and I got the shakes real bad for the first week. So try and quit early before it gets too gnarly. This seems like a harmless drug only because there is so little general public knowledge out there about it. Don't get it twisted. It's a fucking drug just as much as any other mind altering substance out there. If you have experience with it you'll know what I'm talking about.

What about if you actually can't stop? That was me. I tried many times, and failed many times. I justified my daily abuse with ideas like ""Well, it's literally just a plant. It's holistic medicine."" or ""This is better for me than some terrible conventional pharmaceutical pill"" or ""I can quit when I need to but for now this is working okay"" or ""I'm not losing work or relationships over this so it must not be that big a deal"" or ""I'm so much more sociable and creative with kratom, if anything it helps me"".... the list goes on. 

The truth is that kratom was a solution for me for a while. However, that solution was short lived. In a short time after starting to take kratom regularly my dependence grew and I was popping 60-80 half gram capsules per day. Gradually, I no longer felt euphoric when I took it. It simply became what I needed to function and feel some semblance of normalcy. It got to the point that I literally couldn't take enough to get high because I'd get sick and throw up. It was something I hid from everyone, was ashamed of, and it made me feel less than.

So I tried to quit. I told myself changing my diet and lifestyle would do it. So I started practicing the Wim Hof Method, went on a clean keto diet, took up meditation, and started working out. Got a nip of withdrawals and went right back. Tried to quit a few times again later and didn't last a day. I was truly a slave to this stuff and knew on some level that I'd lost almost all control over it. 

Time passed and eventually I found myself at bottom. In my sobriety I've found that really I started taking kratom to try and quell my other addictions. Alcohol, Aderral, and cocain being the main ones. Again, kratom worked to do that for a while.... but soon I found myself coming to from a two day/night coke and booze bender that almost cost me my relationship and my home. I had enough and decided to seek help. I finally admitted to myself that I had lost control and couldn't do this alone. I reached out to AA and found an incredibly beautiful community of people who dealt with the same struggles as I had. I found a real solution in that program and have been sober and free one day at a time ever since. 

Look, this isn't a pitch for AA or anything. It's not for everyone. Not everyone needs that drastic a solution. Also, people have their issues with 12 step programs and I get that. But look, if you can't quit. I mean, if you really can't quit... it's there and it does work. Chances are that if you have no control over kratom you might not have control over other substances as well. So if the shoe fits, well, consider trying it on. It works amazingly for me. I'm happier, healthier, more productive, and present than I have ever been in my adult life. 

Okay in terms of managing the withdrawals there's a few things that helped. Here's a little list of things that you might try:

1. In the early stages my stomach was killing me. What really helped was taking a hot shower, lying on my back, and letting the hot water beat down on my stomach. Sounds weird I know, but when my stomach was turning inside out while cleaning out all that sludge it helped.
2. Wim Hof Breathing Techniques. If you don't know what this is look it up. It's really easy and will help with mood, relaxation, and just generally make you feel better.
3. Magnesium supplements. This helped keep me relaxed and supports cellular function. 
4. Melatonin. It's hard to sleep in the early stages of WD. Melatonin helps, just don't overdo it. 
5. COLD SHOWERS. I don't recommend this during the first couple days, but after most of the shakes are over and you're feeling the stomach problems, depression, and lethargy.... this is by far the most effective thing I found to make me feel better. It kind of sucks but it really works best out of anything I tried. 
6. Staying busy. Don't call in sick to work if possible. Going to work and staying active will suck but at least keep you somewhat distracted from your misery.
7. Reach out for support. Be honest and let people know what's going on. You don't need to suffer this alone and having someone in your corner can make a world of difference. 

&#x200B;

Hope this post helps someone out there! Know that you're not alone and being free of this substance is possible. I'm rooting for you and wish you all happiness, peace, and strength.

It was great as a temporary harm reduction tool, but terrible as a long-term solution. My meth addiction was like an injury that never healed properly because I was putting a band-aid on it, which was kratom for me. 

I have now taken kratom regularly for about two years.I don't go so far as to hate the drug, or call it sludge, because I can still remember how precious it was to me when I first started taking it. It gave me my sense of self back after torturous mental withdrawal from meth. I felt my psychomotor functioning return every time I dosed. It was like emerging for air after being underwater for an incredibly long time.

The reason kratom became insidious for me is because it replaced sobriety. Never have I taken a drug with such frequency and devotion, ignorant of any consequences and thinking it was generally safe. Because the kratom high was my new sober, I remained ignorant of the ways it was changing me overtime as I fell deeper into its grasp.

The reasons I want to quit kratom are:

The clock is always ticking to when I don't feel good anymore, creating the ultimate anxiety.

If I spent $5 a day on kratom for a whole year, I'd be spending $1,800. I can't afford that.

If I finally land a stellar job or meet a special person while still taking kratom, it will become almost impossible to get off or explain it to others and the experience will be ruined.

It is stunting my mental and emotional development. I am only acting instead of having genuine interactions with people. I'm only going through the motions.

It is causing me physical weakness and chronic conspitation, as well as other physiological issues.

It narrows my scope and prevents me from expanding upon my own ideas. It prevents me from reaching further in life.

But the greatest reason I want to quit kratom is because I'm sick of always feeling vulnerable, like I never have full control over any situation I'm in because I need kratom to feel okay.

Today is my 8th day of CT, and I feel as if I am past the acutes, but have now hit PAWS. My enthusiasm for life is returning, but I am still greatly inhibited by fatigue and a lack of concentration. I can feel it in my bones that it will be a while longer before I'm better, but I know in my heart of hearts that I'll make it through this time. 

The one thing I try to remember is that the way I am feeling and the content of my thoughts are constantly changing. I cannot always control my thoughts, but I can control my actions. If I choose not to act on a thought, or to dwell on a thought, it passes. Every hour of every day of withdraw is hard, but there's always moments of hope to hold onto.",24,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.63938147}"

Why I Stopped Kratom and won’t go back

DON’T GO BACK. It’s too good. It’s the perfect drug. You’ll say that you can manage it on a schedule. You’ll say that you’ll dose small. It will take over your life. It will be all you think about. Your relationship with friends and significant others will suffer and you will have a huge separation from things happening around you. My experience, of course, not everyones. 

Effects during: 

It gave me serious energy and escape from bodily pain. However, I couldn’t remember priorities. I would go into a short-lasting depression. I would feel like a junkie waiting for my next hit. My relationships I felt like I was faking everything. My short term memory was shot. I was not productive in the most important things because my strategical brain was taken over by Kratom. 

Effects while getting off: 

You’ll have a runny nose whenever you used to take it on the hour. You’ll have mild cold symptoms. You may have aches. Besides those physical symptoms, you’ll battle serious anhedonia, where every day things just aren’t super exciting or fun. However, your relationships will improve right after stopping because your mind won’t be dominated by thoughts of kratom.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5003872}"

I was at a point about a year and a half ago where I would take at least 30 grams a day and I’ve made my way to 1 gram twice a day. Yesterday was the first day I decided to quit. I’m mostly tired of losing my hair and relying on something so much. The last time a quit something was a nasty adderall addiction in my early 20’s so I sort of get the process. I have a question though. I’ve seen a lot of people post guides on what to expect, but not so much ways to make things more bearable. What are the best OTC medications to help with the withdraw symptoms? I’m assuming some NAIDS would be useful and I’m sure things like alcohol would bandaid the feelings but have a potential risk of gaining a new addiction. I know there are herbs like ashwagandha to help with vitality and fatigue. Is caffeine helpful or does it make things like restless legs and anxiety worse. Basically can someone give me a comprehensive list of things to help? If this is already on here I didn’t see it and I’m v sorry to post again. I started using kratom daily after the SSRI I was prescribed for anxiety made me feel like I couldn’t be fully happy. By the way I hadn’t always had anxiety, but it was something that came later in life after adderall addiction and a Xanax overdose.

I wanted to know if this has happened to anyone else, and ask to warn people how much you take.","I’ve been a kratom user for about 2 years now, but will say I have been a extremely heavy user during this pandemic. Long story short, Friday I took a lot of kratom periodically throughout the day (a lot because I wasn’t feeling it for some reason). Had dinner with the girlfriend at home, I started to feel extremely cold, regardless I got up to wash the dishes after dinner, and the next thing I know I’m waking up on the ground to my girlfriend crying saying EMS was coming....

Thankfully I felt fine when I woke up ( just a little confused), and after 2 long days in the hospital, they determined I suffered no damage, I’m a healthy male, and it was stress produced by kratom.

This has been a wake up sign that I need to quit. You’d think after experiencing something like this I’d be scared cold turkey, but of course I took some yesterday just to sleep. I realize how fucked up this is, and I’m looking to quit for good. It’s going to take a little bit of time, but I will quit this demon, as I never want to put my family or body through this again.

This is a fair warning, as the doctor says this happens more than you would think with ppl who are heavy users of this. So this is my warning to anyone out there still using a lot.

I realize that's noir much given the huge daily amounts some people are consuming. I'll also add in that I think that negative withdrawal symptoms are/will be mainly psychological for me (anxiety, irritability, mild to moderate depression). The only physical consequences I anticipate are tiredness from sleep deprivation which paradoxically is my main reason for quitting.  I wake up after 5 hours or so of sleep and can't return to sleep due to being wired from the absence of kratom in my system. I'm thinking that trying to slowly taper from 15 grams is almost pointless and that I could push past all side effects in 10-30 days.  The one tapering strategy that makes sense to me is to  slowly reduce my early morning dose and then hold out until late afternoon/early evening for a second dose which I would slowly reduce as well. The only snag being that I work as a waiter 10-5 4 days weekly and I'm pretty dependent on it for optimal job performance. I'm very into self care and ""biohacking "" and am also aware of various supplements and psychological/therapeutic tactics for dealing with the psychological fallout yet I just can't seem to get out if my comfort zone and let the ease and comfort that kratom provides go even though I know that within a month or so I'll be in a net benefit situation.  Another consideration is the fact that I am currently interested in someone romantically whom I just met and I feel like the temporary ""non kratomized "" me would shut down and totally fail to win her affection. I feel like after a while I could explain my situation and she would understand.  There's also one other specific situation I'm dealing with that will be resolved in the next 1-2 months that is in consideration.  But hey, there's always something right?

I've been on off kratom for over 4 years now...this is my 4th time relapsing back on this stuff.

I can't believe how viciously fast my tolerance has built back.  It's the worst it's ever been.  I think that is what makes this addiction so frustrating is that there is no reward for it...if I were still even experiencing a tiny kratom high then I'd just stay addicted for the rest of my life...but I get nothing from this.   Everyday it's the same routine....I wake up and dose 10g, and then I keep dosing trying to chase getting a tiny kratom high, and then I start to feel like shit from dosing so much.  I end up feeling nauseas so I eat and then dose more, and then I get the wobbles and the nods and my day is ruined.

I have to admit that I feel like I can't trust myself anymore.  This is the only place I can feel safe talking about this because I know others can relate.  Outside of kratom I have a very successful life...I run multiple businesses, make great money, I am an athlete, and have lots of things going for me...but kratom is destroying my life.  Kratom is killing my energy.  I wake up everyday feeling the kratom hangover and have like no energy to push myself in my workouts.  

It is so true that every relapse is worst than before...I wish I never heard of kratom.  I am terrified to think of the 30 day withdrawal period i'm going to have to go through again.  That last 30 day quit cold turkey near killed me....but unfortunately I just can't do tapering....my brain doesn't work that way.  If I try to taper then I'll just keep dosing more.  

The hardest part is that I don't have the time to take off 30 days of life.  I'm a single dad and so I can't just go to rehab. I'm not sure what I'm going to do...I need to think of a plan...any advice or tips or words of encouragement would be grately appreciated...i'm not giving up.  I""m going to quit no matter what it takes. Just need to think of a quit date...and create a plan of action.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.84984106}"

My jeep needs work which can be done in 3 days also my license is screwed but I can take care of that by wednesday also but it is a hard process. I'm literally an outlaw right now but I love the car camping traveling lifestyle. My point is I need to function for those things.

So, many years of up and down addictions, opiates and benzos had their hooks set the deepest. I've always kept myself in ""check"", with the mentality that I didn't want to be controlled by a substance. I hit rock bottom after my Mom passed away 7 years ago and started slipping hard. I had always turned to kratom to help with WD and DT's, which turned into a crutch rapidly. I've always hung with a ""rough"" crowd that insisted on dragging others to their level. Two years after Mom died, I had mostly rid myself off these ""friends"" and started working construction with a Christian foreman and Mennonite co workers. They took me to a Christian event, that turned my life around at the time, and put me on a positive path for a bit. I started attending church regularly, all while taking kratom on a hourly basis. Hard drugs were gone though. Over the next five years, I went from buying at a local head shop to purchasing online. The price difference (30g for $30 vs 250g for $25) exponentially increased my intake from 15g a day to around 64g a day, over a year or two. I quit going to church, kratom was like a black cloud hanging over me, that I kept secret and simply felt I was ""fake"". I maintained the 64 -80g daily intake, with quitting/lowering in the back of my mind for what seemed like ages. ""At least it's not oxycodone or xanax"" was my go to excuse, for the habit and the cost (those addictions were much more expensive). Living that lie (still do), has been my personal hell for what seems an eternity. Anyhow, a couple months ago, I started preparing my kratom in capsules vs toss and wash. Way more convenient while at work or public outings. I prepped half full water bottles with 8 one gram scoops before that, and had checked the accuracy of the scoop so there was no doubt that each dose was accurately 8grams. My day revolved around the time for the next dose, which I carried pre mixed in my work bag. Back to the last couple months, I've been using 00 gelatin capsules which I mistakenly assumed held one gram of powder each. After a while, I realized 1000 capsules only used roughly half a kilo. It took time to notice because I simply had several kilos on hand of a few different strains, and I mixed and match with no inventory by weight. Well today, just out of curiosity, I checked the weight. My ""00"" caps only hold 0.58 of powder. Granted, since making the capsules, my day mostly still revolves around the next dose. Taking capsules vs toss and wash, for me, has different effects. The caps take longer to kick in, but I've noticed that lately I've been skipping doses without realizing the time lapse. Mild victories, but major for me. Now, after learning that I've effectively reduced my intake by almost half, I'm ECSTATIC!!! I feel that I CAN get a handle on this addiction. Im sure the correct course of action is to continue tapering. But by how much? Should I start taking one less cap per dose for a week or two before knocking another one off then another? I know I'm still at a high daily intake, but looking for insight from people who have been through it.  Sorry for the long post, and thanks to anyone who reads it!

I dont want to have to quit again & I know the energy that I got from Kratom comes at a great price. Financially, physically & spiritually & I know now the answer is not to take the "" easy"" route & start using again. Although I have struggled with multiple chemical dependencies in my life. I must remember that before I used Kratom I was able to get things done & not be at the mercy of this stupid gross green sludge. 

I am also reminding myself of the negative side effects of using Kratom such as puking for no other reason than having taken kratom. Also when I started using kratom again I had a very very scary episode that felt very similar to a seizer. I suddenly had no control over my body, I forgot who I was & where I was, I was shaking uncontrollably & ended out falling to the ground. It was a terrifying experience & I do not want to put myself through that again.

Life is hard sometimes but I’m ready to let this stage of my life shape me into the person that I want to be. I haven’t been feeling the terrible regret that I was feeling during my time with kratom. Just know that all of you are stronger than you could ever think, and there comes a point where you just want move on. I know I’m at that point, and I’m not going to let anything or anyone change my mind. The first step is knowing you have a problem with controlling yourself with kratom. To me, this was probably the hardest step to get to, because I justified my usage for months on end. Being aware that I was fucking my body up and ruining my relationships was enough for me to call it quits. There will be good and bad days ahead of me, but each day I will go to bed happy knowing I’m one more day closer to being myself again.",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5149285}"

Kratom fucking did that to me! I started my try to quit when I realized . I was literally going to bed and in a hurry to do so and so excited forrrr ... you guessed it MY NEXT KRATOM DOSE IN THE MORNING. I found myself going to bed not tired at all and so restless thinking about my morning dose. Same with my after work nap, I would have a hard time napping beacuse I’ll I’m thinking about is in 3 hours I’m gonna take my dose. It robbed me of any excitement  to do anything but dose.. 

Think about this guys I know some of you feel like this.

Here's a little background.
I shot heroin for 7 years and have been dependent on kratom 3 different times, always as an opiate substitute. The longest I used kratom for before was a year and then went back to heroin. This time I finally got sober when I went to prison for 14 months.  I managed to maintain my sobriety for 9 months after being released and was then hospitalized due to an infection I got from a cut at work. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital and almost died. The whole time I was in the hospital I kept accepting the 20mg of oxycodone they were giving me every four hours and by the time I discharged I was seriously hooked again. I started using kratom when my prescription ran out, for fear of going back to heroin. I'm tired of this shit, it doesn't even make me feel good anymore but if I dont have it I feel like shit 

My primary encouragement for quitting is my love of crossfit. I am a level one coach and have serious aspirations of doing something ""great"" with crossfit. Ever since I started using kratom I've noticed my resting heart rate has gone up from 41 bpm to 58 bpm and my HRV has gone down from 180-195ms to 45ms( on a good day). The workouts have become much harder and I feel like my fitness is never improving no matter how hard I work.

Anyways I wanted to start this thread for some accountability and to welcome you guys on my journey. 
My last dose was yesterday morning  around 9 am and im definitely feeling rough right now but I'm determined to stop. I slept well last night but woke up with rls, anxiety, stomach cramps, and a runny nose. I have 2 weeks off from work starting on tuesday because I'm getting carpal release surgery so I figured this would be a great time to kick this crap.

I had a back injury and picked up a pill addiction. I've been using kratom ever since. The original back injury is long since not an issue. But I'm still on the krarom. And I'm sick of it. It's $40 every 2 weeks I could spend on other things. 

I'm not a very heavy user. Around 20 gpd. But I've been using for over 10 years. The second I'm awake I tnw and it goes in small amounts all day. It's ridiculous. 

I didn't think I'd have much of a problem going CT. I've beem through withdrawal from ""real"" opiates before and did it. It's 3 days of hell and then mostly done. 

I didn't even last 48 hrs off kratom. I ended up dosing around 3 am because the restless legs had me in tears. 

I feel like I've failed. I'm going to try a taper. Dose only in the morning and before bed. Around 12 hrs apart. Kratom seems to have a longer half life than pills. But even tapering is *still using* and I didn't want that. Just looking for some words of encouragement I guess.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82113415}"

Day four and five weren’t so bad lots of aches and pain but I have fibromyalgia so that kind of normal but the pain was worse then it ussually is.  Mentally I was fine.  Worst thing was no sleep the second I would fall asleep I would wake up five minutes later with nerve pain so bad I would wake up every couple minutes only able to sleep and hour or two if you call it sleep.  Last night I went to work and my whole body felt like I had done an iron man it was so soar.  But it didn’t feel like nerve pain is was more like soar muscles from too much activity but wow was it soar.  Last night I slept 7 hours only waking up a few times. Felt so good I can’t describe it.  But today I feel like I’m over the hump physically.  Once mentally this was a cake walk.  I’m reallly bad with anxiety and depression but never struggled with either so far.  I do take gabapentin for fibromyalgia but I’ve been taking it so long I have a real high tollerance but that could have been what helped but I don’t think it was that much.  I’m not discrediting other people experiences I feel for those who had a harder time so much that has to be terrible.  But don’t let other exsperiences pych you out.  The brain is powerful enough to induce physical symptoms with fear alone.   I can’t tell you how happy I am despite still dealing with some pain.  Stay strong and be prepared for a hard time but don’t let things get in your head.  Look into gabapentin too I’m not a doctor or telling you to try it but it is pretty easy to find legitimate reasons to get a prescription.   I’ll check it later this week too for an update but thank for this feed and keep it up the hard work,3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44323966}"

2020-09-05 20:28:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/comments/inccnj/kratom_thought_experiment/,KRATOM THOUGHT EXPERIMENT,"—My background (not necessary to read) I  work in the medical and pharmaceutical industry, I have my bachelors in organic chemistry with a minor in biochemistry and sonographic science and as I was going through withdrawal I had what felt to me was a spiritual,  as well as scientific epiphany.

-I have a belief that many people, even in the scientific community find quite controversial. Its has to do with the law of conservation of energy. The law in of itself is not debated as it's well known in physics that both matter and energy cannot be created nor destroyed. An example of this law would be boiling water. As you put energy and heat into the water, you are adding energy that was in the gas that was then ignited by the energy of the spark from the energy generated from pressing the igniter on the stove, which in turn caused the gas coming from the stove to go through a change in state due to the addition of energy. That gas,fire,spark,water is all going somewhere, its’ energy is being converted into steam. Not a single energy particle is ever lost, ever. “Since the beginning of time, everything that ever was or ever will be is already existing”

-TL;DR So my theory: I believe that if we apply this same law to all of this time we have been enhancing our energy by trying to be happy all the time (or numb) by fucking with our biochemistry; that's not how the body works unfortunately, we can't be happy all the time. And all that time we spent happy when we were supposed to feel something else, we have to pay back that energy to universe; and the universe always comes to collect. If you’re in WD that time is now.

Unfortunately I quit and relapsed several times untill about 3 years ago when I finally kicked the addiction for good. Sadly I lied to her about my relapses. I would relapse and she always caught me. This damaged our relationship and her trust for me. We got married  just a little less than two years ago.  I have suffered  with  undiagnosable stomach issues for the last 12 years of my life so I'm always dealing with abdominal pain . This is what started my pain killer addiction and also led me to Kratom. About 2 and a half years ago (7 months after being sober) I heard about Kratom. I'm desperate to fix my stomach issues so I figured I would give it a try. That was probably the second worst decision I have ever made right after taking opioids. I don't have to tell the story because all of you already know. You start with teaspoons and end up with tablespoons. I was probably up to about 30 grams a day towards the end here. It has turned me into an impatient, agitated and angry person. I have been treating my wife like absolute garbage for the last two-and-a-half years. We just recently got back from a family vacation that was with her family and I treated her terribly. Her entire family saw it. Everyone was asking her what was wrong with me and if we were okay. That was pretty much the last straw. My wife is now not sure if she can put everything I have done behind her to give me another chance to show her that I can be the person I used to be. There's nothing more that I want than to be normal again; to treat her with the respect and love that she deserves. She is the best thing that ever happened to me and I would be devastated if I lost her. She took off Thursday morning for Maine with her family to get away and clear her head. I supported her decision to go as I really believe she needs the time and space to think. I decided I was going to take the opportunity to show her that I am serious about changing and quit Kratom while she is gone. I'm starting today when I get home from work. I'm flushing it all down the toilet and I have the next 3 days in a row off. I'm hoping I can get through the worst of it by Wednesday morning as I am back to work then. She comes home Tuesday night. I'm not worried about her seeing me withdrawal maybe seeing me suffer she will realize how dedicated I am to getting myself right. I can only hope that she gives me another shot. There is nothing in this world that is worth losing her over. Wish me luck guys! I will continue to post as I go through the withdrawal symptoms over the next several days.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6967036}"

So at least it won’t be as bad as quitting after 3 years of using everyday. 
My Kratom use was once every month... and then I met this guy.. and he wasn’t really a good person.. and I didn’t want to let go. It was nice to have someone in my life. I numbed everything with kratom. I almost think I was miserable in the relationship so that was the only thing that helped me deal with it. But there were also times it agitated me pretty bad. 
I am really just babbling. So here’s my first post on here. I can’t do this anymore. 
I cannot even take the powder anymore.. I get instant sick.. so it’s all extracts. 
I have money to buy it which makes it very hard. But if I keep doing a bad job at my work....I not going to have a job. 
I just need to get to 3 days of no use. And then I am taking Naltroxne. And hopefully this month supply will give me the strength to stay away. 
So I’m sad over a breakup that I shouldn’t be sad about... and now I’m quitting this. Sometimes anger can get me to be tired of it all. 

I am also curious.. am I going to realize something I did bad in the relationship?? Has anyone gone through a break up and realize after quitting that is the problem?

This week was harder than the previous one, mostly mentally, I had some physical symptoms showing up, mainly back pain and joint pain, mild and manageable though.

My mood is very calm, Its like I dont feel nothing, emotionally dull. I never had those usual mood swings as others have. I feel dead inside. No sex drive, but have no ED.  
 I have become extremely self aware, sometimes I feel like Im watching myself from third person , very dissociative feeling, I feel like something is lacking in my life. It come and goes, its not like that the whole day. I feel mildly anxious during the day in waves. Im naturally neurotic person though.

I have no desire to do what I love, drawing, play games, go out,,, the anhedonia is the worst part of K withdrawal in my opinion. 

I experienced these symptoms before, so I know it will pass after a month and a half probably, but I hate it.

I was on suboxone until about 3.5 months ago when I decited I was strong enough in my recovery and didnt want to be addicted to anything anymore. The withdrawal from that was torture. I had heard about kratom and how it gives you energy and that it isn't addicting. I heard that if you did withdrawal, it would be like withdrawaling from caffiene which would be a cakewalk compared to suboxone so I started using it. At first I tried to not use it everyday, just a couple times a week. But ive gotten to the point where im using it everyday. I take anywhere between 6-14grams which I know to some of you, that isn't much. When I do take a break, i take a little left over suboxone so that I dont feel sick. And now Im in the same fucking trap I was in 3.5 months ago. I know that if I cold turkeyed it, it wouldn't be as bad as suboxone. But as I said, I used to bang dope so any feeling of withdrawal at all sets my mind into pannic mode. I am looking for supplements or any advice to get my through. I suffer from PTSD, severe anxiety and insomnia. Kratom helps with that. So any supplements that would help anxiety in particular would be great. Also I get really bad restless legs without kratom.

Do you think this would be an easy withdrawal since I haven't used very long and have all these backup drugs that they would give you in detox if you're lucky?

I felt confident that I could go in and get gas and a granola bar and not be tempted to buy, and that's exactly what I do: I go in and I remember the smell of the place and the feeling of anticipation I'd get as I was about to top off my supply and I picture myself getting home and having my first toss and wash from a new bag. It's not a good memory. I feel cheap and guilty for succumbing to convenience store pleasures for so long.

So, I'm at the register paying for my gas and a granola bar (I glance at the kratom display, but have no desire for any) and the manager comes up and says, ""Hey, we've got some new samples in. They're free. You want some?"" I tell him, ""No, no, I'm done with that."" I looked at the little packs in his hand, they were nicely designed, a brand I'd not heard of. He kept holding them out to me telling me to take them. I just said no thanks and left.

But as I was going to back to my car, it occurred to me that he seemed different, almost like a shade of himself, and I wondered if he was now addicted. And I felt bad for him and I hoped that I in my tie coming in and buying from him every few weeks for the past year had not tempted him into thinking that this stuff was ok. And the whole thing made me feel sad and wonder if I shouldn't go and tell him that he shouldn't be selling this stuff. 

Anyway, has anyone offered you free samples? Is this a new thing? Does it happen to people the clerks recognize as users? I had never been offered them before.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5696168}"

I have plans to bring my remaining kratom to a friend Saturday morning (he is also giving me some of his home made kimchi and a bottle of my favorite hot sauce so I can distract myself with hot sauce endorphins)

Tomorrow morning Im going out to shop for a ton of healthy food so I can gorge myself on berries and such for distraction.

My plan is essentially to isolate myself in my apartment with non-kratom related distractions and fooda, and bear through the first three days in solitude.

Never really felt like I was abusing a drug. I also had my battles with alcohol and recently stopped drinking and am 64 days alcohol free. I feel like a bit of a fraud on my sobriety groups because they don't know I am using Kratom shots. I think the shots definitely helped quitting drinking because the shots always even me out.

This is my second time trying to quit kratom. This time Im doing it for me. I have been taking about 70 grams per day for like 1.5 years and have been taking it regularly for about 2 years. Im so constipated and tired all the time. I feel so terrible if too long has gone between a dose. If i take too little before bed I wake up with my muscles jerking. 

So thats me. Im not sure how some of you have been able to go off from a large habit cold turkey. Magic? My body would literally shut down if I tried that. I have experienced that withdrawal when running out and waiting for delivery. Its awful. I suppose some of us just react differently than others. 

Anyway I just don’t want to be dependent. Its expensive. And i feel like at this dose its wrecking havoc on my body. It felt like a miracle when I first started taking it but i don’t have the self control to take it responsibly. 

So the last two weeks I have put together a very slow taper of 10% per week.  The first week was ok. This next cut I have really felt it. Have not been sleeping as well. 

I wish I could just quit, suffer and be done but I cant stop functioning for a week or two. I work, Im a mom, im a student. 

I would really love some tips or support. Any recommendations for those who have been through it to stick with it and make it easier?

Things in my personal life are far from perfect but I didn't expect that freeing myself from the shackles of kratom would make everything perfect.  

I have made many adjustments over the last year, especially with how I deal with difficult and negative situations.  In the past I would take kratom and kick the can down the road when it came to problems.  I have learned to be much more proactive and attack issues and put them to bed.  I found early on that most problems can be dealt with swiftly and there is no reason to overthink them and ignore them out of fear or laziness.  

It took effort to quit kratom and it takes effort to be successful in day to day life as well.  This is what normal people do every day.  I might sound stupid that I am saying this but this is how it was for me.  I allowed a drug to keep me locked down and I wasn't willing to put in the effort to better myself.

Yes, I spent close to 6  years of my life using kratom and quitting.  For much of that time I thought kratom was a godsend and was really helping me.  All the emotions, feeling and pain that it caused could fill a book so I won't even go into that.  All the regret associated with that time is too much to process much less carry.  I prefer to think positive and move forward making living amends to my family, friends and other that my behavior affected.

Used for years, new to this sub","I started kratom because I heard it on the Joe Rogen show and it sounded fun, and of course it was.  I don't even remember when that was.  Years ago.  I feel like I don't remember many times that I wasn't either dosing or thinking about dosing.  I did it mainly on weekends.  It made everything more interesting; cut the grass? Sounds fun! Clean the car? What a blast!  Etc etc. Then I started using during the week.

I also had a drinking problem, which I will admit kratom helped me stop last March, just in time for the pandemic.  I'm genuinely grateful for that.  The only trouble is that I've apparently swapped one bad habit for another.

Now I'm at 5 gpd, 7-10 on weekends. Maybe not a lot to some, but it feels like a monkey nonetheless.  It's on my mind constantly and I'm sneaking around the family dosing.  JFC that feels low.  And now sleep is pretty crappy, ringing in my ears, and so on.  It's the end of the line for me and I've got to stop now because I know where this is going and it ain't good.

I quit for a week or two a few months ago.  That's when I learned about RLS, like all through my body. I won't complain because I know some people here have it WAY worse.  I'm more concerned about the psychological part. When I stopped depression followed, like I was paying it all back. I never had depression before kratom.  And as far as willpower goes? At night and morning, I'm ready to quit forever.  Let's do this!!!  Noontime?  Um, Where's the kratom!?!

Anyway, I'm self aware enough to know that I've got to stop, now.  So hello everyone.  Today is day one CT.

(20 days kratom CT),"Hey guys and gals! The people in here have helped me immensely when I was down at one of the lowest points in my life, so I though I'd give at least a little bit back to the community.

I was using about 30+ gms for about a year and suddenly ran out of supply when the orders somehow got messed up. I had no way of getting to kratom for at least 5 days so I was heavily into CT in day three when I found this reddit. The people up here helped me get through it and not take any more when it was time for my order to arrive. 

It's day 20 today and I can honestly say that overall, this might be the best version of me in the last 20 years since starting my adulthood. In little less then three weeks since quitting, I was able to get from an irritable, angry, emotionless, antisocial and unhappy mess (which happens to most of us heavy users after the initial highs) to a calm, collected, thoughtful, cheerful, clear-headed, empathetic and creative HUMAN BEING. 

I've been experiencing social anxiety my whole adult life, and that's about the length of time I've been on the lookout for substances to ease this burden of mine. I've always been weary of the prescription stuff, but thought that if it's easy to get, then it shouldn't be too hard on me, right? Yeah sure. Anyway... I've only started using kratom for the last year, after my daily dose of phenibut, which I've been using now for more than 5 years (went from 100 mg to 3 g in this time), didn't do it any more for me and I was afraid of upping the dosage any higher. So while reading this, keep in mind that it's also been 10 days of CT from phenibut for me. 

These habits are not only helping me to heal from long-term substance abuse, but also moving me into higher planes of consciousness. I'm starting to live life I've always dreamt of. How do I know it's due to the habits? Because I'm NOT TAKING ANY SUBSTANCE that would have the power to do that! :D 

So, without further ado, here's my daily habits plan that has literally changed my life upside down. From the worst time in my life to the best in three weeks. 

Each morning upon waking: 
- 4 series of Wim Hof's Method (WHM) breathing 
- 30 minutes of meditation 
- 5 minutes cold shower 
- journalling 

Each afternoon after work or evening before bed: 
- rinse and repeat (if very close to bed time, skip the cold shower as it will wake you up)

Additional extras: 
- I'm also making sure to get regular exercise 3-5 times a week with at least a couple of heavy cardio and/or weightlifting sessions in there to push the limits 
- trying to eat better food (organic, less sugar, LCHF if possible, intermittent fasting on weekdays).

But even before these extras, I was starting to feel amazing simply on the twice daily habits above. 

I'm starting to become religious about my morning ritual and complete it in about an hour in succession before anyone else wakes up. With a family and a child, as well as running a business, it's harder in the afternoon, so I sometimes spread the routine throughout the afternoon and evening (ie breathing before leaving work, journalling in little chunks throughout the day, cold shower immediately after coming home, meditation right before bed etc). 

All of this is supported by science as well. A lot of the physical aspects have been quite thoroughly researched by Wim Hof and his team, while the psychological aspect, which is in my opinion even more important, is lagging behind as always. But some ground-breaking work is being done on this topic as well. I've studied all that I could find on it abseil be continuing down this road for the foreseeable future. Check out the polyvagal theory (also in connection with PTSD and CPTSD) if you'd like to learn our more about why breathing exercises, cold showers, meditation and writing down your thoughts help heal and optimize your vagus nerve (the one that also regulates your anxiety, fight/flight response etc.) and thus help get you in balance psychologically, emotionally and spiritually. 

This in turn means that there is a way to handle life naturally without substances! And not only handle - but thrive on it! I've now written 150 pages of some of the best events of my life that have taken place in these last three weeks since starting this journey. Might turn it into a book some day haha. My social anxiety is now virtually non-existent, I'm social for the first time in decades and happy to meet (new) people, I'm laughing, I'm not in my head all the time, I'm not self-conscious, I'm living in the moment, my energy has been picking up daily, my focus is the best it's been in years (I can actually read a book without rereading the same sentence 47 times in a row lol), and I'm generally happy in my day to day activities, appreciating even the small stuff, not irritable all the time and looking for the next chemical buzz to forget about the dull life for at least a fee moments. The nice extra has been that I'm starting to be more spiritual about life, something I was into when a young adolescent, but which somehow got trampled when ""the real life"" kicked in. I'm adamant that I'll be exploring this aspect of life in the coming times. 

And the best part of all of this? I know I haven't even scraped the surface! For instance, I'm still not sleeping all that well (kratom and phenibut CT will do that to you apparently), I still get random flushes and heavier heart beating, so essentially still dealing with many withdrawal symptoms daily. But I can still honestly say that it's as good as it's ever been for me. 

Oh, and one last tip regarding my daily routine: I've completely blocked out all of the mainstream news and their destructive propaganda about the world and current events. It's their world, not mine. I only need to look out the window to see the weather, don't need them to tell me it's all doom and gloom. I've started following about half a dozen of people on YT with different areas of expertise (politics and world events, economics, as well as some other successful people etc.) with a positive outlook on life, centered on solutions rather than bitching about everything, instilling fear in us every chance they get. 

Hope all of this helps anyone. It certainly changed my life in ways I could have never imagined. I'm calling it the new me - the true me - my rebirth! See?! I AM becoming spiritual after all! :DD

A lot of out of control emotions, crying or wanting to cry over small things. Muscle twitches. Random, deep pains. The list goes on really, but that's the majority of the issues I've been having. Oh, and GI issues as well. Kratom used to keep me constipated, but now I have a lot of loose stools and am never constipated, ever.

^(Eventually, I want to write an even longer piece about this topic... possibly with the help of some of you, especially since I haven't experienced using ""helpers"" for sleep or during WD. The ""strongest"" things I've used since I quit Kratom are CBD and Ibuprofen, both for pain. Helpers are important for a lot of people, I just personally didn't go that route.)

Anyway, my experience with sleep issues / insomnia: 

* I started getting only 2-3 hours of broken sleep during the last week of my taper. That continued for 3 weeks into my quit. (So, almost a month total.) 
* Then things got better some and I had a couple of weeks where I'd get 5-6 per night, with some 4s sprinkled in (I think one night was even 7).
* Between 40-50 days I experienced PAWS, which included 10 days of 2-3 hours sleep a night again. 
* Last month, I went through about 3 weeks of 4-5 hours sleep. Better than the PAWS 10- day span, but still not great. 
* I was finally adjusting to 5 hours sleep per night when last Wednesday night I got zero. 
* Then I went 3 days in a row of 6 hours each night. I thought I heard the angels singing! It was great! 
* Then, Bam! Last Sunday, 3 hours, awake at 1am and stayed awake. 
* Monday I got 5. And last night 6.

Mind you, I'm not complaining about any of this and I wouldn't even say it's a problem for me... NOW. I'm functioning during the day just fine. But I know A LOT of people here who are just debilitated by the lack of sleep that occurs when we (thankfully) take Kratom out of our lives (like I was for the first couple or three weeks). Somewhere about mid-way through my first month clean **I accepted that this was how it's going to be for a while**. I gave up fighting my body and brain repairing themselves. If I laid down to try to sleep and couldn't for an hour or so, I just got up and attempted to do something productive (and quiet, since it's nighttime). If I didn't have motivation to do anything, I watched TV or YouTube until I felt tired again and tried again. Most importantly, I browsed this subreddit. 

In my experience, part of the reason we experience so much anxiety from not sleeping is because we don't ACCEPT IT. That anxiety just causes even more Insomnia. In other words, **the more I allow myself to stress out about not sleeping, the more I'm going to not sleep**.

The good news is a.) I haven't used Kratom in 2 1/2 months and I don't EVER want to use it again. Period. No ifs, ands or buts. b.) I haven't died from lack of sleep. I've been functioning good enough. And since I started jogging again 10 days ago, I feel better than I have in years... physically, mentally and emotionally.

So, if you're struggling with sleep like I did, hang in there. I believe, the sooner we accept the situation, the sooner we can get back to at least 75-80% of the amount of sleep we used to get. Remember, our bodies and brains went for so long being dependent on Kratom for sleep. Now that damage we did has to be repaired. Ultimately, only our bodies / brains can repair it... naturally, and for the long-term, that is. (As I referenced earlier, I'm not here to judge anyone who takes anything for sleep. Some people absolutely need it. I didn't and don't want to.) So, **have PATIENCE** with the repair work that's being done behind the scenes, so to speak. Acceptance and Patience have been key for me.",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4954295}"

I'm not sure whether to just jump from the hirsuta after say 7-10 days, or taper it down over 14+ days. **Does anyone have experience using hirsuta to get off kratom/eliminate WDs?** Please tell me how it was and any suggestions for how to go about this optimally.

I started using kratom back around 2010. From that day forward I essentially used it everyday thereafter. In the final 2-3 years I was up to about 50gpd, and the final year I was 75-100gpd. In addition to kratom I was lying to my psychiatrist and getting prescribed all kinds of drugs for depression and anxiety like lexapro, Ativan, as well as Ritalin for ‘adhd’ (kratom murdered my ability to focus). The extreme kratom use was wreaking havoc on my mental health which is why I needed all those psych meds. I lost many thousands of dollars, decimated my finances, virtually destroyed my relationship with my wife, and watched my physical health unravel. I had a job that paid very well (around $100,000 a year) and was always broke and behind on bills. But I couldn’t tell anyone and was convinced I couldn’t go to rehab because I couldn’t lose my job, because if I lost my job I’d lose everything like my house and car. But eventually it became too much so I came clean to my family. I dreaded this day for years. I thought they’d be so disappointed. After years of shame and dreading telling my parents, I went to their house and said “mom, dad, I’m in trouble...I’m an addict.” The moment had come. The moment is been dreading for so long. What were they going to say? Would they disown me? Would they chastise me? Shame me? Nope. They said “yeah we know. You need rehab.” And just like that, all those years of dread and fear, evaporated just like that. Man I cry just writing this. So off to rehab I went. I got placed on disability for a few months and went through the process. I’m clean now and have been for over 6 months. 

For me now the most frustrating part is trying to impart this feeling of freedom on others who I see doing the same craziness I did for so many years. I was TERRIFIED of coming clean to my family so I lied constantly for fear of looking bad essentially. But now that I’ve done it - come clean to everyone and admit I had a problem - I cannot believe I went so long living in such extreme misery. I just wish I could somehow transmit that feeling of courage and RELIEF to others. I gave up everything for my sobriety. I lost my job and right now I’m unemployed. The thought of losing my job before when I was using was not an option. I told myself repeatedly that I can’t go to rehab because if I lose my job my life will be over. But the thought of going back to having a job and money but also being enslaved to kratom literally turns my stomach. I wouldn’t go back to that for a million dollar a year salary. I’m literally willing to give up all earthly possessions for my sobriety. Nothing is like the freedom of a drug free life. I now don’t need any psych meds. Magically my mental health problems cured when I got sober. I enjoy painting and socializing now, something I never did in my using days.

Today I quit cold turkey and about 16 hours in was freezing cold, sweating, whole body aches, runny nose, sneezing, and excessive yawning.   This scares the shit out of me.  The other times I stopped and felt close to no symptoms for days when I was taking more then I am now.  I take gabapentin regularly and decided to stop until my symptoms were at their peak just to get the most out of it.  Halfway through work I cracked and took a small dose of my medication and within a half hour I wasn’t cold, sweats were gone, stopped yawning, no sneezing, no watery eyes, and stomach had an appetite.  The only thing that continued was really bad pain in my legs but once again with my health issues that is normal.  Fear went away and was able to joke and have fun.  I’ve read a few post of people who take the same amount of kratom daily that didn’t feel symptoms and the commonality was gabapentin.  Both times I quit before I was taking this during withdrawals but not specifically for them.  I guess I’m writing this post because I believe strongly now that this medication can be a huge help getting through wds.  I’ve seen a lot of people recommend it and report that they have used it to help as well.  I know what your thinking now though what about being hooked on gabapentin now?

I woke up every morning saying one last shot. Then got high just making my next trip to see that neat little box of shots at the smoke shop. Google mapping smoke shops when traveling. And that in itself became an addiction. And since I was buying shots, I’d throw in 5 extract pills for another $50. I’d tell myself I deserved it because something good happened at work. I’ve since quit all substances. At 45, I made the decision that I really couldn’t live this way any longer. I hate myself and need help beyond my 12 step program to address both my disease of addiction and the unaddressed trauma that nothing has been able to address. 

So, I gave up. I asked for help. Hardest thing I’ve ever done. But now I’m doing an intensive outpatient treatment program for 90 days with another 90 days of post recovery with my counselor. In the past, I don’t think I was really ready to quit whatever substances I’d play the chess game with by replacing this for that. The hardest part for me was accepting I needed help beyond quitting Kratom. 

But that was the starting point. I have a HUGE amount of work ahead of me. But at least I’m starting to have some hope that I wasn’t overlooked by God or am permanently broken. I would have never seen that small glimmer of hope if I kept using. And physically, I look like a healthy person again. You can get your life back. But you have to trust that the suffering will end. And don’t use no matter what. The best things in life for me have required the most work. I’m not healed, fixed or reborn. Maybe one day I’ll be. But knowing I’m actually worth something is more than enough for today. Thank you Kratom.

So I've been trying to quit for months now. Since quarantine started I tried to go cold turkey three times and never made it more than five days before the physical withdrawals were so painful I had to cave. After the discouragement of failing so many times, I slowly rose back to my old dosage, and watched my life go back to being entirely controlled by kratom despite its effects destroying my physical and mental health.
Something clicked in me when I started trying to make more of an effort to actually experience life and as I began tapering again I realized I could finally feel joy again. Something I hadn't been able to fully experience in years, since this addiction took hold of me. 
I meet with my doctor and my therapist every week and I began recording my tapering progress which has inspired me so much to see me actually accomplishing something.

I'm so stoked on my progress, you have no idea. Only two weeks ago I had gotten up to 4 doses a day, 30g a day. It seems small but this is a big deal for me. My depression and anxiety is already easing up so much and I feel so motivated to take back my life and I'm actually doing it. I'm finally starting to hate myself less. I'm crying now because it's been so so so long since I felt this capable and this proud of myself.

I still have a long way to go but I'm finally excited about the future and feel confident in myself for the first time in so long.

I used ""recreationally"" (once a week for so) since 2018. However, I've been on 3 - 6 GPD, once a day, every day for the last six months (since quarantine started). Keep in mind I'm 115 lbs so this is the max I can dose before full-on vomiting.

For the last six months I can not go a day without skipping my dose. Wasn't a big deal when the lockdown (where I was) was very intense - no one was leaving their house at all, no one was seeing friends, nothing was open. And I was bored, stuck at home, and maybe a little depressed. So why not start taking kratom every day?

However, things have eased up a little where I'm located but the habit hasn't changed. Meeting up with my SO? Need to take my dose. Friend wants me to come over for a drink? Need to take my dose. I end up excusing myself from pretty much any event early so I can take kratom. I almost don't even remember what it's like to be around people sober and I'm scared it going to affect the way I view my relationships. I'm sick of my life revolving around needing to take kratom, and how it makes me so clouded mentally, how it gives me the false sense of accomplishment, the unwarranted feelings of euphoria for wasting afternoon after afternoon melting away. It also has a 50 / 50 chance of giving me an upset stomach even on a low dose which means a 50 / 50 chance I'll have to run to the bathroom or run home to puke and try to hide it. No one knows I take this.

While my withdrawals may not be as extreme I'm still def getting cravings, fatigue, RLS symptoms, and insomnia. I slept SO easy on kratom, I was in bed by 9pm every night and slept like a baby. Now I toss and turn and toss and turn, feel like I constantly have to move and cannot sleep throughout the night. I don't even remember it being this bad before kratom.

I'm prescribed Atrax for anxiety and find that that helps the insomnia / restless a little. My brain keeps telling me one more small dose won't be a big deal, but I don't want to have to keep starting over.",4,"{'quarantine': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6047411}"

You will acclimate to life without Kratom and you will be happy about it. You're going to have some days when you'll feel happier than you have in a long time. You'll have some tough days, too, but those get less and less. But the biggie here is that you'll be FREE. I love not having to schedule my day around a substance. I love not thinking the cashier is thinking of me as an addict. I love being able to feel again. I love having hope again. This is what awaits us all when we make a smart, committed quit.
