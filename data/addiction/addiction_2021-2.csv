Long history with polydrug abuse peaking in 2010 with 4-methylmethcathinone and oxycodone, luckily got off with suboxone for 8 months and didn‚Äôt really feel the two week withdrawal. Off drugs from 2011-2016, slowly introduced back into oxycodone with doses rising as high as 300mg/day binges for 4 days before jumping on to kratom or suboxone.

Flash forward to 2021. I‚Äôm 34 and my poly drug radar is going haywire. I‚Äôm in the medical profession and am limited in my options but I seem to be doing everything possible to sabotage myself. I got off a 2mg/day Suboxone habit only to transition to a 2mg/day Clonazepam usage backed by spikes with 100-120mg/day methylphenidate binges leaving me depressed and phenibut run-ins with no self control. I have Lyrica and clonidine which I‚Äôm supposed to take to manage the symptoms but I can‚Äôt seem to stable out. If things look too boring, I‚Äôll purposely fuck it up and justify using oxycodone when it comes around every month as a way to even out, but I gotta stop this immature behavior. I have a wife who was minimally supportive getting off suboxone and a beautiful 2 year old. Any advice is greatly appreciated that doesn‚Äôt involve tucking myself away in a rehab.

So just as an update, when I got to the rehab I had snuck fentanyl in with me and did it in the bathroom. Thankfully my roommate (who is a great friend I‚Äôve had for 5 years) was awake at 3am and heard me making the death rattle in the bathroom. She found me on the floor, purple and not breathing. She was slapping me, yelling at me, and trying to do compressions. She ended up grabbing a tech who narcaned me twice and  thankfully my friend had already called 911 and the ambulance came and picked me up. I woke up to the thought, ‚ÄúI really fucked up this time‚Äù and I had never felt so cold in my entire life. The tech said 40 more seconds and I‚Äôd be dead. The paramedics took me back to the treatment center and for the next couple days I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought that I wish they hadn‚Äôt found me... I wish they would‚Äôve just let me die. Now, two weeks later, I‚Äôm incredibly grateful. I‚Äôm happy to be alive. I can finally feel hope again. I can‚Äôt keep doing this to myself... and I know that if I do, my luck will eventually run out. I couldn‚Äôt imagine the pain my parents would have felt to hear that their daughter died on Valentine‚Äôs Day from an overdose. This time I will truly do everything in my power to stay sober. And I just wanted to thank everyone who commented on my last post, the support was overwhelming and so helpful. I love you guys so much ‚ù§Ô∏è",58

Does anyone in the UK remember this? 

This guy was clearly an idiot but his image appeared in every UK newspaper and he was eventually tracked down and outed....but it wasn't like he was acting in an aggressive/racist/nasty manner.

Only the linked article expressed concern for his welfare. Now, clearly the guy was being an idiot but many of us have acted like idiots at the age of 23...the difference being that every person around us didn't have high quality video recording devices in their pockets. 

What happened to this kid? Do we think that the media behaviour was warranted? Yes what he was doing was illegal but did it justify destroying the guys career and was any consideration given to potential addiction/emotional issues he was suffering from?",2

Give or take a few prison terms. The things I'm learning about addiction,  myself, and how addicts are in general, and i would like to share with the Group, in hopes if touches someone else, like it did me.
   Addicts are looked at like selfish people, when infact we wear our hearts on our sleeves in some form or fashion. And we use to get away from those feelings. Doesn't have to be we care too much. It could be we hurt too much. But our addiction is an escape, we can at least all agree on that (am I right?) 
    I was just speaking to someone about how even  after I'm clean if I see someone from the old days of using and they need a favor, I'm quick to help. (I've been there) I know what it means to get even the slightest help when in a bad spot. But as this frien pointed out, now I've compromised myself, my hard work, infact I've compromised everything, and I need to 1st, think, and be slow to respond as I would usually. And 2nd, be as selfish about my recovery/sobriety as I was about my addiction. (Now I wasn't selfish per-s√©, with my drugs) but I was quick with a lie or excuse when asked about it. I now need to apply that to the flip side of the coin, ""can you help me with blah,blah,blah?"" (LIE) ""sorry I'm in a rush, gotta do X,Y,Z right now."" Seems easy right ? But for an empath like me, it's a real challenge. But in the long run (And THAT is what we really need to look at)  it'll save me from a slip. ""Hey thx here's a (enter drug of choice)  for helping) or a** BLURP**  ""pull to the side of the road!"" And I'm back in, (bc I was being nice) but my record (which is ALL the court will see) says I was back at my antics. So in short, be selfish for your own sake, and think slower, to save your sobriety and freedom. You've been lied to by a fellow user, or dealer (yes you have) what's a lie to them, if it's to save your sobriety??",6

An example is best way to ask is my friend a problem gambler.

We will play poker regularly, but the game itself is not enough. He always wants to put in side bets, such as owing a few euro more to the person that knocks you out.
Or changing how much of the pot the winner gets ( we play 20 euro per rebuy and often second place will win 80per cent of the money, chips are just for the game).

He gambles online for more money than that, but would never go to a real life poker tournament.

He is also heavily involved in bitcoin and constantly pushing others to invest in it because 'it can only go up'.

He gets very frustrated if you don't go along, to the point where I won't play poker with my friends of he is playing, because of the aggressive response to me just wanting to play casually.

What do you think?

2021-02-26 20:52:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ltdfp3/the_key_to_longterm_sobriety/,The Key to Long-Term Sobriety,"  

## Long-term Sobriety

One of the many keys to the ever-changing lock of long-term sobriety is compartmentalization. The idea of compartmentalization is very simple however, this does not mean the application process is an easy one. The definition of compartmentalization is, ""the division of something into sections or categories.""(en.wikipedia.org) But, how does this relate to my sobriety? We've all heard the coined term ""one day at a time"", clear use of compartmentalization. Many, if not all of us, can not imagine our whole life without the use of drugs or alcohol. However, this is possible by using compartmentalization to break forever into one day at a time. Some addicts can go 24 hours without getting high or drunk, this is how they must break it down. For the addictions and alcoholics who cannot abstain from using or drinking for 24 hours must break this concept down into smaller pieces, I will not drink for 6 hours. There are those of us who cannot even imagine 6 hours and must be broken down even further, I will not drink for one hour. The true success of this method comes when you can realize you ONLY have to not drink for 24 hours. Sure, you can drink tomorrow but just not for the next 24 hours. The secret sauce, if you will, is that by the time that 24 hours ends you reroll the dice and a new 24 hours commences.

## Large Tasks

Though this concept seems simple and counterintuitive it has been proven again and again to work. Not only can you use this for sobriety you can use this for day-to-day hassles and mundane activities. Say I have to clean the entire house, an enormous and daunting task. Naturally, as addicts and people in general we will procrastinate and leave this task for the very end. The solution to this problem is apparent but not easy. You can make this daunting and intolerable task seem simple and easy through the use of compartmentalization. If you have 10 tasks to do start with one. Tell yourself, ""I will do one task and then I will be done."" By the time you are down with the first task, you have initiated that spark of motivation. If you don't trust me try it for yourself. About 80% of the time if I have a big task and I tell myself I will do one thing I end up completing the entire task. Completing that first task will give you the motivation you need to complete the subsequent tasks. This works incredibly similar to your sobriety. You develop a 'streak' of sobriety time and you've already completed one day, why not try to get another day. These days string together and before you know you're sitting there wondering how the hell you got a year.

My current WIP has two characters who struggle with addiction. One of them has been addicted for a long time and the other is forced to take the drug over a period of time until he becomes addicted. What I wanted to ask was: how can I write the characters addictions respectfully (ie any words that I should stay away from, any stereotypes that should be avoided etc) and also if you had any experiences you wanted to share to help me write their addictions in a way that doesn't show them in a bad light. So many characters that are addicts are portrayed in a terrible light and I'm looking to break away from that as I firmly believe that addiction is an illness not a crime.

I understand if no one wants to share with me as I very much do not want to make anyone upset - that is the exact opposite of my intention with this post. Please don't feel as though I'm trying to poke my nose where it doesn't belong; I simply want to write my characters in a way that will not harm the community.",7

I get sad thinking about the number of hours he spends just scrolling - time he won't get back and time he won't have spent with his loved ones.

He stays up later and later (going to bed at 2:00am a few years ago - now it is 5:00-6:00am). Apparently the majority of what he does is read the news and post articles to facebook... When I visit, he frequently disappears to go sit at the computer instead of spending time with his family. There was a time when we would eat lunch together on my lunch break, but now he wakes up at 1:00pm, sometimes 2:00p, and that is no longer possible.

I posted my relapse on Facebook and they pinged my phone to find my location. My friends thought my post was a suicide note. I‚Äôd like to say it wasn‚Äôt but I can see why they thought that. The police knocked on my car window less then an hour after making the post. I didn‚Äôt want to go with them. I just wanted to fade away. Ironically the Police Sgt that talked me into going was at my wedding about 20 years before.  I climbed in the back of the ‚Äúescort‚Äù police car, and went on the long drive.  The longest ever. I just wanted to sleep. Sleep forever so I didn‚Äôt have to face anyone...I had done it again... I let everyone down. I‚Äôm a failure. 

It was ironic going to St Michael‚Äôs Hospital... walking in and recognizing a number of the people in the waiting room, as I had worked in the surrounding area for almost half my life. I thought everyone was looking at me. Laughing... ‚Äúlook at Jay hahaha‚Äù. They weren‚Äôt but that‚Äôs how I felt.  After all. I‚Äôm a failure. 

I was surprised at the visits I got.  A barista from the Starbucks I frequented, some coworkers, a couple police officers and a homeless guy I helped reunite with his family.  I figured everyone came to fill the gossip with other coworkers and friends. I thought I was so important that everyone was judging me. ‚ÄúWhat a loser... a failure‚Äù. 

After being released I went to my mothers. She gave the look of disappointment. I knew what I had done.   She took me in. Then it hit. Covid.  Nowhere to go anymore. 

The year has passed quickly.  It‚Äôs one I won‚Äôt forget... I never really knew how amazing my mother was   As the years went by, life went by... I would see her a few times a year as work or schedule always seemed to get in the way. I can honestly say if it wasn‚Äôt for her info not know where I would be... after all. I‚Äôm just a failure. 

Clean and sober, i got to spend some quality times with my kids... I miss the everyday interaction more than I can ever explain. It‚Äôs something we take for granted. Until it is gone.  They are growing up so fast. I‚Äôm happy I can see that. 

I grew closer to my eldest daughter. she had been my rock since my downward spiral  all began.  

So here I sit. So many to thank... the treatment Center I was at prior to my relapse - who gave me so many tools to help with my recovery. Including some friendships that will last my lifetime. To my family for giving me another chance. To the group I admin as well as the many I‚Äôm a part of who inspire me daily with their own battles.  Thank you to the ones who got me into treatment in the first place... the DM‚Äôs in my life.  Most of all. Thank you Mom. I‚Äôm a decent writer but when it comes to actual external emotions I struggle. Just know I love you even though I do not say it often. 

Although I‚Äôm not where I want to be mentally as I‚Äôm sure most of the world is during these trying times. I am getting a little better everyday....I can smile when I look in the mirror...because I‚Äôm not a failure. I‚Äôm a fucking warrior...

Hi,
I'm a long time reddit user but this is a burner acc, im not a bot. English isn't my first language so pardon me if there are any grammatical errors. 
Also on mobile, so the formatting might be off. I've been visiting this sub on my main for a while(never joined because I don't want people to find out.)

Im almost 20 and weigh over 160kgs(over 350 pounds). I love food. So much so that I dont stop eating until my stomach hurts and sometimes i feel an urge to eat even when my stomach hurts. I loved eating for as long as I can remember. The problem just got worse during the pandemic. I had to come home(parent's house) and with everything being online, I stay here. Both my parents are working and I stay alone at home all day. 
They are obviously worried about my health and pressure me to go on a diet and exercise a bit. I know that they are just concerned about my health and wanna help me. And I agree. I've joined a gym but I dont go because it's very embarrassing for me and people stare at me when i exercise and give advice that i never asked for. I technically am on a diet(as far as my parents know). But as soon as they both leave for work, I start to feel an uncontrollable urge to order food and just go to town. The sad part is I dont even enjoy eating food anymore, but I still order, eat and then the worst part, I go out and throw the packaging and stuff somewhere in a dump so my parents don't know I ate that much. With me being a 20 year old college kid with no job, I obviously have trouble finding money for food( my mom makes delicious food, we're not poor. My mom just makes it for 1 person. I feel like i eat for 3 people). So i steal money from my own parents. I am tearing up as I write this. I STEAL MONEY FROM MY OWN PARENTS FOR FOOD THAT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T EAT. These realizations hit me atleast once a day and I vow to stop ordering food, i delete all the food ordering apps. But then after I while I lose all that motivation and I order food. Before it was just secret extra lunches. I feel like I hit a new low recently. My dad's 52 and my mom's almost 50. So they sleep by 10 pm. I stay awake till about 1 or 2 am atleast because I have work to do. Ive started secretly ordering food at night after they sleep and silently eating it in my room. I store the packaging in my bag till the next morning and throw it out secretly.  The other day, i was eating at night and started tearing up in between the meal. But i still finished it so that no one finds about it.

I feel so shitty and I do want to change but Ive been very unsuccessful. I am not tooting my own horn, but I am generally a  smart kid. I topped classes with minimal effort. I understand computer science concepts relatively easier than a lot of people and so on. But my grades have been tanking recently(recently as in college. So thats 2 and a half years. I balooned after i went to college. I had no one to help me control my intake and I ate as if everyday was my last). The reason I feel is .. food. I eat a lot, I feel sleepy and lose time studying. 

I really really do wanna change. As ive said I don't enjoy eating that much food anymore. Ig after so much eating, im just tired of it. Please someone suggest me ways out of this hellhole. I really do want to lead a healthy and happy life. I've tried herbal life. It worked for a while and then as with everything i lost motivation and started cheating again. I want to be that smart kid again. And i don't want to lie to my parents or anyone anymore. I can't afford therapy by myself and I doubt my parents are going to agree(mental health is still not accepted as a real thing where I live).


Edit: I forgot to add that I sometimes I just give vague reasons and my dad always trusts me and gives me money. Most of the time i just say Im buying a course online and I need money. He always gives me more money than I ask for just in case I need it. I DONT EVER WANT TO BREAK THAT TRUST.  And if I decide to come out with all this to my parents, I feel that first Id lose their trust, and they'd worry a lot more than they are now and I don't want them to worry when they're 50 years old.",1

I am a 30 year old Male, with a decent life, some schooling under my belt and a decent career in printmaking. 


I have been abusing alcohol for nearly 9 years.
Abusing my adderall prescription for about the same amount of time. 

My addictions have caused me to drop out of school, cut relationships and lose multiple jobs. 

I am a musician and artist so the drugs and alcohol seem to come like a normal ‚Äúmind alteration‚Äù 

But it has reached a point.

Although I‚Äôve never gotten into trouble with the law. The drinking and adderall combination has caused me to pull some real stupid shit.
(Like steal clothing from a donation bin at 2 in the morning, or spend 50 dollars on porn steams at 4 AM.) 


I am now afraid the alcohol abuse and adderall
Usage is beginning to affect my cardiovascular health. My heart hurts at times, and I get numb in my fingertips. 


I have tried to reach out to my parents for help, maybe to send me to a rehab, but it all seems to cost too much. Is rehab really only for rich celebrities? How can I get clean? 

I am in need of help before my addictions give me heart failure or death.

I thought I‚Äôd beaten it, I didn‚Äôt drink from March last year and was aware of the quantity of codeine I was taking and when I thought it was creeping up. I reduced.

I‚Äôve lived in this house which was my parents for 40 years.  My dad died from cancer here, my mum collapsed and died in front of me too, both over Christmas periods.  In between I escaped an abusive marriage, got diagnosed with epilepsy, was made officially homeless for a while and many other things I‚Äôm not proud of.  My brain couldn‚Äôt cope, my only thing I had left was the children.

We were doing ok, I took them abroad, day trips, short holidays.

I sold the house but I struggled to progress that because I can‚Äôt talk on the phone I just can‚Äôt due to anxiety, so it took longer than it should.  Focusing on that I ignored the social services meetings I should have attended, due to CoVid the children had time off school and due to depression my daughter missed appointments.

But the social worker would visit weekly, I‚Äôd make sure it was clean and tidy and try to tell her things even though I didn‚Äôt trust her.  She didn‚Äôt tell me once anything was wrong.  They dropped the PLO process that threatened the children being taken saying I‚Äôd progressed enough to drop that. 

We were looking forward to a brand new start, in a brand new, much smaller manageable house in the country.  I had offer accepted and nothing was said.

January 3rd the anniversary of my mums death social worker came.  She told me it had been decided I hadn‚Äôt done enough and they were taking me to court to remove the children.  The next day the house sale etc fell through.  I spiraled, I managed a few days clean but couldn‚Äôt eat, sleep, I just sat on the sofa wallowing and not understanding how this happened, I felt they planned it, they must have we were 2/3 weeks ago from starting a complete new start and it was gone.

One night after a bottle of wine earlier in the day I sneaked to the shop to get another, I got stopped, drink driving, arrested.  Children were taken the next day. I couldn‚Äôt understand why they let me plan a new life, but a house, arrange schools, and then right before literally telling me I can‚Äôt it‚Äôs cruel at best.

Two days later was first suicide attempt, hospital for a few days I was scared to come home.  Then I caught CoVid. Codeine came out again.  Started drinking daily, until the weekend I hit rock bottom, paranoia, palpitations, vomiting blood, thought that‚Äôs it I‚Äôm screwed.  Had conversations with Donald trump and the queen sitting in my bed, had flashbacks of my life, pretty sure I had seizures.  Begged to just die.

Zoom call with children last week I was drunk and they knew, this weeks cancelled.

It‚Äôs not a pity party I‚Äôm creating here.  I think I‚Äôm over the worst, I pray I am, I‚Äôve been drinking water easily and been able to eat, house is a shit hole but that can wait.  Once your heads clear guilt sets in, worry for the future, worry my children hate me but I have to get passed that.

I‚Äôm planning on continuing selling this house and I‚Äôll rent for a while, I‚Äôm thinking about volunteering or training , my children are safe, so time to work on me.  I don‚Äôt know if I will but I need to try.

I‚Äôm going to get a kitten as a distraction I think. I need to implement routine in my life, I need to get out this house, too many memories and you always remember the bad ones.

I feel ok today, I did have to take just two tablets this morning because my legs were crazy but I didn‚Äôt take any yesterday and haven‚Äôt drank so I‚Äôm praying they don‚Äôt set me back, I also only took 8mg ones.  I  think I might have cracked it again but this time I need to keep it up.

I‚Äôm in trouble I know because the court‚Äôs ordered a hair strand test which will show some alcohol but loads codeine I‚Äôve been trying to avoid it but I can‚Äôt anymore.

I think it‚Äôs time to admit everything and pray after a period of proving myself I‚Äôm given a second chance.

Anyone ever lose their children this way?  Did you get them back?  I‚Äôd love some hope.",2

I‚Äôve struggled since losing my mum two years ago.  Periods of good, bad and bearable.  Social services got involved last year after either the drinking, codeine or both knackered kidneys, I lost my children for a while but got them back and was doing ok until the anniversary of mums death at Christmas .  It started with the occasional wine, then bottle, 2, 3, then I got caught drink driving at night after sneaking to buy more.  Now I‚Äôve lost the children aswell.  Two suicide attempts later at the weekend I think I hit my rock bottom for the first time.  I‚Äôve battled for days to clean my system, I‚Äôm amazed I‚Äôm alive, but I am, and I need to retrain my brain and that‚Äôs what you have to do too.

You will lose your daughter and then everyday becomes a battle not to just not drink but becomes a battle to want to live.

Today I‚Äôm not too bad I‚Äôm tired because I haven‚Äôt slept for days but I still can‚Äôt, but the physical symptoms fingers crossed are now bearable.

Add me as a friend and maybe we can help each other.

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll get my children back, it terrifies me but I‚Äôve finally realized i shouldn‚Äôt think that way, because that‚Äôs my selfishness I should be thinking they are safe, they may be sad but they are safe.

I have no family left,  none, no friends, people say you must have someone but truth is I don‚Äôt, I even gave my dog up.  So this battle I have to face alone, but I have to, I have to accept what I‚Äôve done and stop making the excuse of my mum dying in front of me, I need to put my children first, I won‚Äôt get them back anytime soon if at all, but I haven‚Äôt lost them forever, as they grow the decision is theirs and so I need to work on me in the meantime fans start to prove I can change.

Overdosing on Tylenol can be fatal. 

Em said she has tried everything to get rid of this addiction, she's even resulted to eating ice cubes to try and distract herself from the urge to take the pain killers. 
I asked her if she had tried getting addicted to something less dangerous like food but that didn't end up working either. 

If Em continues to go down this path of taking the Tylenol, she could do serious damage to herself. I cannot do too much because we don't live in the same country and I can only suggest what she can do.

My boyfriend and his brother have a coke addiction and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short but this has accumulated over a long period of time so bear with me. My boyfriend, his brother and I all live together. Since the beginning of quarantine we have all been spiraling into addiction. First it started with nicotine and then eventually coke (we were all previous users). The coke began just as a special occasion to go to a party. And then over a few months my bf and his brother started to bring it home more often. I‚Äôm no angel either. I would get upset with them for bringing it home but would end up doing a little anyway after they said they weren‚Äôt throwing it away. But the switch flipped for me after my boyfriend had a terrible comedown experience and thought he was going to have a heart attack. I had never been so scared. After that we all said we weren‚Äôt going to mess with this shit anymore. Since then (1-2 months ago) I have stayed far away from it. But they have still been getting it behind my back. While I‚Äôm sleeping, at work, etc. It not only upsets me to be lied to and for them to think I won‚Äôt notice but every single time I confront them they tell me it won‚Äôt happen again and still they keep doing it. The last it happened I had a heart to heart with my bf and said if he doesn‚Äôt stop lying to me/ doing coke behind my back I‚Äôll have to send him to rehab, tell his parents, or just straight up take a break from this relationship. After that conversation I thought he had realized I can‚Äôt take this revolving door anymore. Only 3 days after that I got home from a double shift tonight to find that yet again they brought home coke. For no reason, on a random Tuesday l, just because. Part of me is mad that they keep lying to me and I‚Äôm exhausted from this situation, but the other part of me is empathetic that they have a problem and I was part of it up until 2 months ago. Not to mention I love my boyfriend to pieces and the last thing I want to do is leave him like this. At this pint what the hell do I do? Do I tell their parents? Do I force them to get help? I can‚Äôt take being their watchdog anymore because the second I turn my back they do it again and again and again. I‚Äôm just tired and need advice. Thanks for listening.",7

A little background info. I (33F) have a brother (37M). My parents divorced, which wasn‚Äôt pretty, when I was 13 and bro was 17.  My bro was close w my mom during his high school years, got decent grades, played basketball and never caused problems. He was the golden child  (this is important later) and could do no wrong bc he just did what my mom told him to. He got a partial scholarship to college and went 4-5 hours away. We were not close before (he was that ‚Äúmean big brother type‚Äù). 


From what my mom has told me, I‚Äôve always been very independent and self reliant from a young age.  This never changed. Combined w this unaddressed anger about the divorce, my teenage stupidity and her misdirected need to control me, we did not live well together. Long story short, I was kicked out of my house at 17. I went to community college and worked full time to support myself. We reconciled after a few years and realized we have diff points of view on things and agree to disagree which is ok. I love my mom endlessly. 

That brings me to my problem w my brother. During sept 2016, he asked for a family meeting and told us his situation. He was addicted to opioids.  Even though he was making $300k a year plus commission, he hadnt paid his mortgage or any bills in over a year and the $65k he had borrowed from my mom (which I was not aware of) was for drugs. He moved into my moms house and basically shut down. We handled his condo sale and moving his belongings, looked into rehab or in/out patient centers. He said he could do it himself and has been successful/unsuccessful at times.

After a lot of literal blood, sweat and tears, I own my own company and doing ok for myself. After being labeled the bad kid who was a let down, I‚Äôm proud. Now that my bro is home, my mom has been leaning on my emotionally and psychologically a lot but in the last 3 years it‚Äôs been overwhelming. Her perfect child is mow her biggest stressor and she can‚Äôt fix him. Between started my own business, my family, Covid and life in general, I‚Äôm exhausted in every way possible but grateful I‚Äôm still working and providing for myself and employees. 


My mom has provided every ave of help that a person in recovery could ask for but he consistently has user habits, lies and won‚Äôt get a job. It is wrecking her. She‚Äôs aged 15 years in just 6. 

I‚Äôve given the suggestion of giving him a timelines of when he needs to move out so my mom can spend her retirement in Florida as she had planned before he moved home but she refuses. She says she can‚Äôt leave him without knowing he‚Äôll be ok. I‚Äôm a little resentful she was able to kick me out so young but that‚Äôs not the main issue. 


My bro has a history of stealing money. There‚Äôs never been direct evidence but both mom and dad had cash missing within days of my bro being there. The last time my mom found out he stole cash she was barely phased. It broke my heart. Well today he stole from me with hard proof. I called him to confront him and he said he had just forgotten to give me money which was obvious bullshit. He said he‚Äôd pay me that night but didn‚Äôt.

Idk how to handle this. I love my bro and know addiction is not easy but he‚Äôs done nothing to help get his life together. He‚Äôs continually making bad decisions and my mom is a diff person due to the stress and upset. 

I just need some advice as to how to help my family please. I feel like I‚Äôve tried everything and need some outside advise.",2

Hi everyone, 

I really need to get something off of my chest. First, I think I should share my background a little bit. 

I started smoking cigarettes when I was 15. For what? Idk. I was always drawn to being a ‚Äúrebel‚Äù. Then I drank for the first time, and the same night at a drama production after party tried cannabis. Throughout my high school years I truly made a fool of myself at parties and with friends while drinking. Also getting the most ‚Äúfucked up‚Äù, blacking out and getting very sick. 

Cannabis was something that I would do maybe once bi-weekly. It then progressed by the time I was 17 to smoking every night before bed. I would sneak out of my house when my parents were sleeping to smoke a joint or out of a homemade pipe. 

At my prom after my high school graduation I tried MDMA for the first time. And that‚Äôs when I would say my true fascination for drugs developed. That summer I would do it at least once weekly. 

Then, that same summer (still 17 years old) I tried cocaine for the first time with my friends. We walked around outside for at least 6 hours continuously taking lines. By the end of the night I was strung out and extremely speedy, couldn‚Äôt sleep for at least 4 hours after I took my last dose. 

Fast forward to today. I am 23 years old. From the ages of 18-21 I would say I definitely used drugs (alcohol, cannabis, mdma and cocaine) to cope. Every weekend was filled with use of at least one of those, but usually a cocktail. I was also using cannabis daily. If I was not at school or work I would be high. I thought it was a lifestyle. Then my mental health deteriorated. 

From the ages of 21-22 I was truly doing very well. I distanced myself from the friends I was doing drugs with and focusing on myself and building healthy relationships with healthy people. I was happy. I was clear headed. I was proud of myself. Then, one of our friends died and I started rekindling with those old ‚Äúbad influences‚Äù. 

Every time I‚Äôd hang out with them, there would be cocaine there. I would dabble with it and think nothing of it. Fast forward to now and I am doing cocaine at least 3-4 times a week, and I have impulses to buy it and not think much about it. I haven‚Äôt really told my good friends that are good influences because I am ashamed of myself. I know it was my choice to hang around them and partake in it. I know it was my choice to continuously see them. But now I am at a point where I crave cocaine. I don‚Äôt want to be this way. 

Anyone else have any similar experience or can give me some advice? And thank you for taking the time to read this behemoth post.",2

I (32F) live with both of my parents who are 70+ and act as their caretaker, as well as work full time from home for the time being. This has been my living situation for the last 6 years and it works out very well for my parents and I. I am really close to my mom and my dad and spend a lot of time with them. However, 3 years ago, my brother was convicted of several felonies for possession/intent to distribute. He served a short jail sentence, the charges eventually were dropped, and he immediately returned home to live with my parents. Shortly after, he wrecked his car (which I believe was 100% on purpose to get pain killers) and went to court to sue over supposed back pain issues that resulted from the car accident. This process took 3 years, during those 3 years he has not had a job and lived solely off of my parents. After receiving a sum of money after the car accident court case, my dad ""manages"" his money, but my brother takes complete advantage over him. Every few months he goes through a week-long withdrawal from god knows what. Even so, his doctor continues to prescribe him opiates even though the same doctor sent him through rehab and has helped him during several different withdrawals over the years. 

With all of that being said, I am having an INCREDIBLY difficult time because I can see things that my parents choose not to see. For example, my parents are going out of town tomorrow for the first time alone in 20 years, but my brother chose to use this time to tell my dad to give him hundreds of dollars ""just in case something happens when they are gone"" and unless my dad gives it to him he will simply bother my father NON-STOP til he gives in. Last week he went out to a bar and brought a random stranger home (we have all been very strict about COVID), proving again that he just truly doesn't give a fuck about anyone except himself and his drugs. Now it's causing severe tension with what was once a very good relationship I had with my parents. 

Do I have to cut my parents off until they cut him off?? It feels like my only option because I can't live like this and watch my parents be treated like this, but then I would be abandoning my parents when they need help, despite them enabling my brother. If I put up with the way things are running then I too an am enabler, so how do I keep a relationship with my parents and not the human leech living on them?

He is supposed to move out by March 1, but I doubt that will actually happen as he is blowing through all of his money on bars and drugs so far, despite my dad ""handling"" his money. Gosh there is just so much to the full story but this was the best synopsis I could think of. I feel like he controls all of us and we are trapped. I used to have more sympathy and compassion for his addiction, but it's taken every last ounce of energy I have. 

I don't know what I am looking for in writing this out but if anyone takes the time to read this and has any advice to offer, please let me know.

Addiction, and Dependency, are quite different.

Dependency, means someone heavily depends on it in order to have a pleasant or enjoyable time.

Addiction, however, means they feel such unpleasant withdrawal effects, that it greatly defects the quality of their life, and are highly likely to steal, or lie, to support their habits alone. 

Someone who steals to support their habit, and fucks over other people, without caring, or giving a shit, the effects it has on others, is highly likely to be hated and disrespected, and solely for their drug habits. 

In 2015, I was addicted to Cannabis. I stole to support my habit. 

I supported a smoking partner and his girlfriend willingly, not even acknowledging the day I would be caught, and I did on the Friday Morning of June 26, 2015. I was 19-years-old.

In the past year, since covid lockdown, I ran out of money, every, single, month.

Since I have been laid-off due to the global pandemic, and apart from disability pay, have no source of income. 

The past 9 months especially were beyond unpleasant for me to deal with. It was mild for family to get annoyed with hearing me sulk or complaining of being broke/having no money and especially nothing/fuck all to do around here, apart from smoking or drinking. 

Yesterday I crossed the line, and decided perhaps uttering countless malicious and brutal death threats towards family (middle sibling and father) for no reason whatsoever other than attention would provide relief, and it sure did. 

Making violent threats that I am going to kill someone, and inflicting fear towards the other person, gave me an extraordinary pleasant sense of power, dominance, and adrenalin. 

Getting the attention of uttering terrible death threats, gave me a sense of psychological relief, and I never, would have done that, if I just had some weed to smoke, OR some alcohol to drink. 

I had absolutely neither of either or, because I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO MONEY. 

I ran out of money in the middle of the month, every single month, and can‚Äôt buy either weed nor beer, and for the 9th goddamn month in a row. It was then, I flew off the handle and decided to utter death threats toward my older brother of 18 months, along with our father. 

I still have neither (cannabis or alcohol) and the last purchase was a gram on Saturday.

Until my money is in, the next 3 days are going to be brutal and disturbing UNTIL I can either more weed to smoke OR have more beer to drink. 

Being broke (having no money), especially when where in a covid lockdown, with literally fuck all to do, causes extremely unpleasant, psychiatric distortion. 

Obviously It doesn‚Äôt EXCUSE threatening to kill my father along with my middle brother, but it sure as hell EXPLAINS it. 

Being in my very unfortunate financial situation would make anyone, totally insane, it‚Äôs not just me.  ",0

A few weeks ago I had a discussion with a friend about a story of a friend of ours who claimed that she had had a relationship of over a year with someone who was addicted during the relationship. The relationship ended after the guy ghosted her. Years later he confessed to her that he was a drug addict (hard drugs) during that relationship.

I was thinking about it:

1. is it even possible that you have a relationship that long and being able to hide a full blown drug addiction (not even occassional use, but a real drug addiction). I mean, even in cases of a long distance relationship you should notice that someone is not always behaving normal. I get it addicts may lie about something.
2. how can you recognize that someone has this issues?",2

Don't look at my previous posts that I posted in r/heroin or r/drugsarebeautiful. Thank y'all!.","  Hey guys i'm fucking withdrawling right now i know it'll get better I am almost to day 3. Was at an AA meeting with an addict today who said she relapsed on day 3 everytime. Lemme tell y'all what's going through my head. I had 6 months sober at 17 then fucked that shit up. I'm in an APG which i don't know if you guys know what that is. Basically a teen sober group that helps drug addict kids get sober. Crazy Right? In AA meetings I always hear "" When I was your age I wish I got sober so i didn't fuck all of my family up and lose people"" I have lost people to overdoses, drug deals gone bad. I don't know why I am saying that. In the past three months shit has gone south. The person I was living with in spite of my 6 months sober, my program helped me live with someone ""hosting"" as they call it in the apg. Well I fucked that shit up, stole from my good friends mom kpins, codine, adderall vyvanse. A bunch of shit. Got tramadol too. That was the beginning. Then I moved home from ""hosting"" continuing to go to AA meetings fucked up, show up at my APG high, and was lying to my family. This is where shit went south. I bought from a dealer who used to be a friend of mine. A day later she overdosed on xannax. My friend in the APG who i've known for 4 years out of highschool was best friends with this girl. I have to make a living ammends for that. Coke and Oxy's, was it worth it? fuck no. Then I proceeded to prostitue myself for nudes to try and get meth and meetup with people who did meth and had heroin. I found a guy who was going to have sex with me for meth Luckily he gave me his dealer so I didn't have to do that. Also I had sex with a man for some alcohol who was 31.. I am 18. Anyway yeah shit went really south. Speedballed for weeks, my job knew something was up. Stopped the meth, was buying a gram of fentnyl laced heroin every chance i could get, twice a week I don't even know if that's a lot. I've had nobody to talk to about this shit. Welp the fent made me paranoid, threatened to kill someone in a whataburger because I thought I was getting jumped. Was going to overdose, had a knife to my throat. Then I called my sponsor who i'd been lying too for months. He's taking me into his home and holy fuck im so grateful. I have been crying to my friends who somehow are still there for me. I fucked up my family, 4 rehabs 2 years in recovery overdose at 13 I live in the subburbs what the fuck is wrong with me. Besides suffering from childhood abuse but dosen't everyone have that shit??? Anyway I hurt people time and time again. If I gotta be homeless in downtown houston after I can't live with my sponsor anymore I'm probably going to do that. I WANT BEING SOBER TO BE THE ONLY THING I HAVE LEFT. Don't know where I got that but this is defnitley a bottom. parents kicked me out and I don't know what's gonna happen next. Quit my job because I found out I gotta go live in downtown 2nd ward with my sponsor. I need to get this shit on lockdown because if I fuck it up. I am dead haha.

At least the food I really liked and enjoyed. I remember when my ex and I started making decent money and I think that‚Äôs when it really happened. It was more so about the ability to eat at restaurants we really couldn‚Äôt before. To enjoy take out on a regular basis. My jobs have played a role too. Up at 7am not returning home until 10hrs later sometimes. Too lazy to pack lunches most days but also thrilled to eat fresh fast food on my breaks.

When you can quit, you won't want to.

When you want to quit, you won't be able to.

No addict ever sees it coming. Not even in hindsight, no one can say ""That. That was it, That was the moment I became an addict and lost control"".

They just kept breaking the ""I'll never do [x] for drugs"" promise we all make to ourselves. We just keep pushing that line. I'll never take out a cash advance for drugs. Until I did. I'll never take a payday loan for drugs. Until I did. I'll never ""borrow"" money from my 401k for drugs. Until I did. I'll never straight-up clear out my retirement account for drugs. Until I did. I'll never take money from my child's savings account.  You guessed it. Until I absolutely did.

And it keeps going. And eventually, you're no longer in control. You're driving across town, tears streaming down your face while you scream at yourself to stop, turn around and get help. But you won't. You'll keep driving, meet the plug to trade more cash that isn't yours for a substance that will ultimately lead to you either incarcerated, institutionalized, or dead.

This sneaky disease is telling someone who is reading these words: ""That's not you, don't worry"". It's telling you it won't be you, that you're in control, that only weak-willed pathetic people who have no sense of when things are getting bad will get themselves into this trouble.

Long Post.","Don't really know where to begin. I have a depressive personality and have been diagnosed with BPD traits in the past. Ever since childhood, I have been dealing with emotional issues. My father being a surgeon, I had easy access to prescription medications at my home. As a teenager, I got into the habit of abusing painkillers and codeine syrups. It wasn't too bad. I didn't use daily. I was suffering from heavy depression and insomnia, and i would use maybe 3 nights a week on average. I stopped when I went to college.
I started smoking cigarettes and pot at 18, alcohol at 19. At 20 I realised I am really prone to addiction, and that awareness kept me from trying anything harder in college. But I was smoking a pack a day, was stoned all the time, and the drinking kept getting worse. I failed 2 years of college and had to start seeing a therapist to deal with the emotional issues.
I was able to stop drinking daily when I was 24. Couldn't lay off the pot and cigarettes though. It ruined college for me. It took me 7 years to graduate engineering school (normal is 4 in my country). But laying off the alcohol cleared my mind a bit and I found my calling as a scriptwriter. It was hard to function normally while high on pot, I tried limiting it but couldn't really manage it.
Last year in march, right before my 26th birthday, I quit cigarette. My ability to do so encouraged me, and I was able to quit pot in July. I haven't smoked pot since.
The problem now is, whenever I read or watch something where a character struggles with addiction, I feel myself falling back. I have been back at my parents place for a couple of months, and while watching Euphoria, I slipped and had a bit of codeine. Currently I'm watching The Sopranos, and the arc of a character dealing with H addiction got me twitchy again. Yesterday I took some painkillers. Today I had my first cigarette in 11 months.
The thing is that being a writer, I have to watch and read stuff. I can't really avoid that. But I need to be able to deal with it, or else I will fall back into my old habits. I wanna stay clean. I don't mind having a joint once in a while, or a drink on occasions. But I can't afford to feel weak the way I feel while watching these characters struggle with their addictions. I don't wanna use just because I felt the urge.

Weed, benzodiazepines and alcohol have been my worst enemies, with a sprinkle in of an assortment of pills.  A little backstory... I have a huge opportunity to get a job as a pipefitter.  I am an addict of weed gabapentin and benzodiazepines in my opinion.  I need to pass a hair follicle test to get this apprenticeship opportunity.  I need to get sober of weed which I smoked 2 or 3 boof carts and plenty weed each week and Xanax or Percocet and many gabapentin while I drown myself in Hennessy, bud light and Jameson after work üòÇüò∞.  Last Sunday I took about 3 grams of gabapentin and drank approximately 550ml of Hennessy vs and 6 Budweiser.  I later smoked all the empty carts and leftover weed before I had quit.  I cried for hours to my girlfriend and it really felt like more tears I‚Äôve ever cried in my life.  I have been shielded and blinded my whole life.  I also today kept on keeping on and relapsed.

I got this.,"I've smoked weed every single day for the past 13 years with the exception of a couple of very short breaks. Even during those times, I swapped my weed out with alcohol, or xanex. I genuinely don't know if I've been a whole 24 hours, totally sober, in 13 years. Not this time, no weed, no alcohol, nothing!


My partner has still been smoking. I have still been sitting with him whilst he is smoking. An oz of weed is just chilling on my living room table. I thought I had no willpower. I've never been able to say no to a joint. I didn't want to have no weed in the house and try to quit. I think if I couldn't see it, or know that I couldnt have one if I reeeeeaaaally wanted one, it would be too unbearable.

People say weed is not addictive, they are full of shit. I am (was) dependant on it. Cant eat, sleep or even shit properly and my stomach is constantly in knots. I'm hoping my bodily functions will return to normal soon. 


I am really proud of myself. I really needed to come to this subreddit to let you all know, if I can do it.. YOU SURE AS HELL CAN DO IT. I don't want to get ahead of myself as it is only day 3, but today has felt easier than yesterday and the day before. The only way is up, right?


Meditation has been a godsend. Specifically the Monroe Hemi-Sync tapes. If you haven't explored them, take reading this as fate. It is your time to start.


Whatever you are all battling, take every moment as it comes. If anyone needs support, please reach out. Never be too disappointed if you haven't reached your goal today, there's always tomorrow and I have full faith you can do it.

I'm a 25 year old guy and I have been smoking hash for about 10 years now. I've also been a heavy drinker for nearly 8 years though my alcohol consumption has gone down to once every couple of months in the past two years. 

The thing I really struggle with is my hash addiction as I regularly smoke at least 12-15 joints a day on my own and every time I try to stop I fall back even harder on it. I almost dropped out of uni because of being extremely lazy and wasting my life away. 

My alcohol addiction stopped when I ruined my relationship with the love of my life. I cant stop smoking up. I haven't smoked up in a week and I am suffering from extremely bad withdrawal symptoms that include
- migraines
- restlessness 
- sleep deprivation 
- nightmares/extremely uneasy and shitty sleep
- insomnia 
- extremely high levels of anxiety and depression that has made existence unbearable to the point I cant function 
- fatigue 
- total disconnect from everyone and everything around me
- anger out bursts. 

These are the ones I can remember at the moment. 
What I want help with is some guidance as to how I can quit smoking up. Anything I read online is extremely generic and doesnt work. I just need some help from someone who can understand me I guess.",2

2021-02-21 03:03:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/losajh/im_lost/,I'm lost,"I am 28 years old. I have been in and out of AA since the age of 19 and am currently 7 days sober from primarily THC. I cannot think simply enough to ""just surrender"" and embrace AA.

Alcoholism, or insert drug of choice, is a ""thinking disease"" as described in the Big Book. I understand how unwavering belief in a Higher Power would help mitigate these adverse thinking patterns/reinforced pathways in my brain. I suppose I'm discovering my recently developed agnosticism, in saying that. Rather than just believing without question, I merely see how unwavering belief could alleviate alot of my negative thoughts, emotions, and, thus, behavior.

I understand how I lack control over a portion of my thoughts, probably more than I even realize. I can only control how I respond to them. I'd imagine I'm much less in control of craving thoughts (especially early in sobriety) as the chemical response from drugs is very strong compared to ""everyday life"" stimuli. 

As I'm writing this, along with every past attempt at ""never using again"", I genuinely realize how much better life goes for me in sobriety. However, AA just doesnt ""click"" all the way like it seemingly has to for it to work. I'm always trying to understand what's causing these repetitive thoughts followed by poor decisions (especially in active addiction), rather than just accepting I'm ""powerless"" as a blanket explanation. I've said this to my sponsor (and likened AA to horoscopes, which he didnt like) and it was unsurprisingly met with ""your best thinking got you here"". I frequently believe that AA and the idea of ""powerlessness"" leads to self-fulfilling prophecies and feeds the cycle for me.

 ""You've got to put AA 1st above ALL else"" is the biggest turnoff that led to this questioning. I was merely existing in addiction, very isolated and distanced from loved ones. I didnt get sober to live in fear of relapse. AA describes fear as the root of all of our problems, so why does it seem like it's the root of their solution? 

If I dont go to a meeting every day of the week, I'm ""falling short"" and ""nearing the next drink""...the list of things ""suggested"" seems to just grow. It's common for sponsors to force meeting attendance, especially home group, even before important family events (scheduled in advance) just to make sure I am keeping sobriety 1st on the list. The common response is ""you wouldn't be there if you weren't sober"" (whether in the physical  or mental sense). That's the point though, I AM SOBER TO BE PRESENT FOR LIFE.

 I want to understand more what is physically occurring in my brain (much like mental health diagnoses that I also do not accept, but that's another story/post) and how to rewire these negative pathways I've reinforced through several separate periods of substance abuse.

 This is something that has been on my mind but buried for awhile now.",2

Just to preface, this post is not meant for using anyone's advice to ""secure a diagnosis"", I am merely looking for peace of mind.

So  I have repeatedly dealt with hallmark symptoms of ADHD my entire life  such as hit-or-miss focus, disorganization, time blindness and  confidence issues which stem partly from what I believe to be ADHD.  Since I was 19 (25 today) I have used substances to make up for these  mental shortcomings and it developed into polysubstance abuse where my  preferable drugs of choice are cannabis and stimulants of any kind. I  had this idea of possibly having ADHD while I had been sober for 4  months though  I did break my sobriety streak at the end of January this  year.

However, ever since I relapsed I have been wondering whether or how ADHD psychs treat patients  who along with (possibly) having ADHD, have a history of substance  abuse and I hope to get some input from you guys in the r/addiction community.  It is worth noting that I have been receiving treatment for depression since the summer of 2019 but haven't had much success.

I brought this topic up with my psych but he refuses to prescribe  stimulants as a principle and even if he did I doubt he would prescribe  an addict like myself. This sort of mindset is very draining and I doubt  that it's justified but that's why I post here hoping for some  reassurance I suppose. In light of my psych situation I booked an  appointment with a psych who specializes in ADHD on Monday and once  again hope to have some doubts cleared.",1
2021-02-20 20:03:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lolett/my_mom_is_addicted_to_a_variety_of_drugs_and_is/,My mom is addicted to a variety of drugs and is mentally ill,"Hi everyone. Never had a reddit before but I have gotten desperate and afraid enough to reach out and see if anyone had any advice for my problem. My mother had cancer twice and multiple surgeries over ten years ago and during this time her husband cheated on her. Throughout this time I spent middle and high school with my own problems and also the emotional turmoil from what my mother was going through. My siblings and I were her only support during this time and there was a lot of fighting between my parents that involved my infant brother and the police were called multiple times. I distinctly remember waking up crying and throwing up almost every morning from anxiety about what the future would hold. Fast forward some years and I made a 4.0 in high school, earned a STEM degree, and have involvement with an industry I really want to work for. I had a great internship happening the summer of 2019, but once COVID hit, I lost all my opportunities and had to move back home (I had to move out of my place for the internship). I have been here ever since. Before I moved back home and would only visit, I noticed my mom was getting dangerously thin, as in, severely underweight. Since I have been back, she has declined even more physically and mentally. There are a lot of days that she simply will not eat ANYTHING. Most days she makes herself eat at least one thing. Other days she will get hungry and eat a lot of food. I am posting here because ever since her cancer and surgeries, she has been hooked on a variety of drugs. She has been on a combination of muscle relaxers, pain killers, anxiety medication, blood pressure pills, sleeping pills, cigarettes, and marijuana all at the same time for years. These years have been nothing but constant fights with her doctors about needing pain meds for the pain she still has after over ten years from the reconstructive surgeries (she had a double masectomy and reconstructive surgeries). Many doctors have told her that she should not be feeling pain still and they have done numerous tests, scans, and have found nothing, and keep trying to get her off the pain pills. I have heard from others that have gotten off of pain pills that once they did, their body was able to heal properly in regards to the pain they felt. Aside from the physical addiction aspect, there are other important factors at play. I highly suspect she is also mentally ill, she at least has depression and definitely generalized anxiety, but maybe also BPD. I make assumptions because she refuses to see anyone that can help her even though she has the resources to do so and is extremely stubborn. She is also heavily into conspiracy theories and believes she is waiting for God to fix her problems. She is not even 60 yet and has a lot of great years ahead of her and I cannot fucking stand seeing her do this to herself anymore. About the cheating husband - he doesn't OPENLY cheat at the moment but there are a shitload of other issues in their marriage right now. The mental and emotional issues run deep with my mother and there's more to this than a physical addiction to drugs. She is withering away more each day, her teeth are falling out, I can see most of her bones, and she is getting more and more fantastical and illogical with her beliefs. I am watching this unfold right in front of me and I really want to fix this. My siblings and I have absorbed all of her problems over the years and are depressed as well. We are actually afraid to move out right now because no one wants to leave her in the condition that she's in. Also, the last time we all left (college, military, internship, etc.) she had a breakdown and tried to kill herself. I am so sorry if this post doesn't make sense, but I have felt so lost for pretty much my entire life, with my mom and her problems always haunting the back of my mind. I want to get out and live my life again and I want the same for my brothers and sister. My mom needs help and I thought it would start with the addictions, but now that I have written this post, I think the issues causing her addictions need to be addressed first, in therapy. I have no idea where to start but I do know that my mom not eating and putting all these drugs into her body every single day is literally killing her. I appreciate any advice anyone can offer.",5

Watching the character spiral down on coke addiction triggered my memories on my own past spiral down in a nasty way. I came here seeking for a place to vent my thoughts, since I haven‚Äôt been to therapy since late 2019. Maybe it‚Äôs time to go back. 

As I said before, I was severely hooked up on cocaine back in 2015/16. And I managed to escape, to rebuild my life to be successful, I mean very very successful. I am right now at a place people envy and admire me. 

So the addiction is not a problem anymore... Or is it? I am feeling bad today. I still have a problem. 

I go out maybe once or twice a month. And I drink. Gosh, I drink. If I‚Äôm at home I get a glass of wine or a beer and that‚Äôs it. A glass of wine once in a while is not bad. But when I go to a bar with friends I absolutely cannot stop myself. I drink like a maniac! I chain-smoke. And I crave coke and always end up doing it. Last night I went on a bender and fucked it again. Two fat lines. Countless drinks. Sipping gin out of the bottle. The hangover is not too bad. But I feel so bad! Emotionally fractured.  Why do I do this? I don‚Äôt hate myself anymore. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself anymore. But I can‚Äôt control myself around booze. Maybe it‚Äôs time to accept I‚Äôm a coke addict and also an alcoholic? 

I avoided accepting that my whole adult life. I never admitted to be an alcoholic. I don‚Äôt drink at 8am on a Monday. Never. I don‚Äôt drink on a Wednesday afternoon. I drink twice a month, on a Friday night, and I do coke and smoke a pack of cigarettes. Does not hurt my life. BUT I DON‚ÄôT WANT TO DO THAT ANYMORE, AND I CAN‚ÄôT STOP!! 

I don‚Äôt want to feel guilty, because guilty isn‚Äôt helpful. But I can‚Äôt help feeling bad for being so weak. For being so damn hypocritical. I can help people and give awesome advice but I can‚Äôt stop myself from slowly and painfully killing myself. This may seem to be an exaggeration - oh she only drinks twice a month... But I waste myself twice a month, you know? And I can‚Äôt stop it. 

I go booze free for two or three weeks fine, Fridays on the couch watching tv with my son. But after two or three weeks, as Friday approaches, I start to feel uneasy, agitated, I can‚Äôt focus properly on other stuff, anticipating the moment I will get to drink and smoke and snort. I was chugging down negronis last night. One after another. The bar closed early because of cv19 restrictions. I went to my friend‚Äôs place, because he had coke. Then went to another friend‚Äôs place because the after party moved there. 

This is the story of my life. Even before I got hooked on coke, I was already drinking in this same pattern, even more because I‚Äôd go out every Friday. Now it‚Äôs not as often.  

My point is: I WANT TO STOP. I don‚Äôt want to love gin as much as I do anymore. I don‚Äôt want to crave it as much as I crave cocaine. 

I need to admit I am an addict and I am an alcoholic. And I need help. Again.

Today we, here in the United States, are facing a culture that tries very hard to confuse us with comfort. With all that clambering we need clarity more than ever. As it was expressed in my interview with [@RubyWarrington](https://www.instagram.com/RubyWarrington/) clarity isn't just something you have, it's something you work towards.  


One of the questions I used to ask all my guests was ""When did you know you were thinking clearly?"" and each of my guests would address how their thinking is only getting clearer and that clarity was not a destination.  


We are all going to have to find clarity within ourselves. That clarity is increasingly under fire from our own culture. And for every one of us alive today we were born into it so we may have never experienced true clarity in our lives before.   


I love you and I wish you and those you care about health, happiness, and safety (inside and out).",4

Ugh it's a big task I must say, but I'm just taking it one step at the time. Logistical it's a nightmare. I've spend so many years isolated in my addiction, so friends and family are either dead or just vanished along the way, and I haven't got a drivers license nor a car so it's difficult, but where there is a will, there's a way.

It's kind of funny going through the stuff one room at a time (currently at number 2). I think many homes of addicts, especially addicts like me, hides on stuff that has been lost or forgotten, and mine is no exception. 

Yesterday I found benzos, a bag of deschloroketamine, and a syringe that still contained liquid, what ever that might have been. Today I found 2 more syringes, empty though, and a bag of coke. I'm so glad it wasn't heroin in that bag, I'm not so sure I would have been able to throw it away, but luckily stimulants doesn't appeal much to me.

I wonder what else I will stumble upon as I'm going further in the process.

That being said, it's just freakin' awesome to do this, creating a home. I haven't had a place to call home since I was 15 or so, so it's a really exciting process.

The truth is that what we want is within us and cannot be manufactured. Nobody has our answer. No product is the key. No path is correct.

It helped me stay focused on my recovery. It was nice. Until there were layoffs, supposedly from covid. I was one of the lucky winners. Me and another guy that went through the program. He had been hired for the same position, maintenance. Fresh outta rehab. They shipped him to the other side of Florida to work at the Pinellas facility. He went back home after the layoffs. He made it about two weeks before he overdosed. He died January 20th 2021. 

   You see nine times out of ten, the people that come to treatment have lost everything. Rock bottom as they say. Generally, it takes a real calamity to motivate an addict to seek help. Their lives have crumbled. Their world is upside down. So, most of the time clients in recovery are completely starting over; rebuilding from the rubble. Desperation, denial, pain, suffering, loss, hopelessness. An overwhelming sense of loneliness. All of these things drop on¬†their¬†head like an anvil when¬†they¬†sober up and¬†they¬†have no choice but to confront them.¬†They¬†have no choice but to confront¬†themselves. 

  True introspection is a foundation of recovery.¬†Addicts in recovery¬†have to look inside and try to conceptualize what¬†they¬†are looking at. It is hard, it is uncomfortable and usually quite painful. Most people are terrified of themselves, whether they know it or not. That self-ridicule begins. That shame. That guilt.

  ‚ÄúLook at you. Look what you‚Äôve done. You have ruined everything. You have no purpose; you have no place; you are nothing but a burden.‚Äù¬†

  Being an addict¬†going into rehab, I¬†felt¬†as if¬†I¬†have been thrown away by society, or by¬†my¬†family; and¬†I knew it was all my¬†fault. The vision of¬†my¬†future¬†went¬†blank.¬†My¬†perception of¬†the¬†present¬†was just¬†a kaleidoscope of raw devastation and unregulated emotion.¬†¬†Getting sober, drying out, detoxing. It‚Äôs grueling. It's painful. It‚Äôs physiological torture. But you would be surprised what you can do when you have no choice; when you are cornered and out of options.

  But what happens when you are back upright and you learn how to play that shit hand life dealt you? When you are doing everything right; staying clean, going to work every day, exercising, getting closer to your goals. When you start to feel what it's like, to actually be proud of yourself. What happens when you do everything by the book and still, life decides to blindside you with another fucking catastrophe?

  As an addict, maintaining sobriety during a crisis can feel like swallowing a live grenade. You want to explode engulfing everything around you.¬†There is¬†no hiding from the threat. No running.¬†Because it is you. Your mind. It‚Äôs¬†your thoughts, beliefs and emotions. An intricate spiderweb of cognition and you are tangled in it.

Because depression and anxiety came with the addiction, towards the end it really was a physical habit not a mental one. Kind of like being in the dark so long then going into the light being too much so mentally i would withdrawn because of habit.

It has only been in the last few months that I have started being openly vocal about my sobriety. It's not that I was ashamed or anything like that. It was just something I felt was personal, and just lived my life.  Well, I started finding out that people close to me also dealt with addiction, or have family members dealing with it.  It was then I decided to start talking about my journey into recovery. 
I have started a Discord chat room where people striving to live the sober life can come chat with others desiring the same thing. If you would like the link, please reach out.  We are open to everyone!

I do think some people are more prone to addiction then other people for example some people can try dope and never use it again.

However other people will not stop using it once they get their first taste.

I am not saying addiction is a product of your environment although I do think it plays a part.

I have never met someone who uses heroin and is truly happy with their life, in fact from what I have seen they are only happy if the dope is in their veins.

The reason why I think using drugs is a product of your environment is backed up by science and in this video, I will go over why and what makes me believe this to be true because at the end of the day numbers don't lie.

Hopefully this will give people a new perspective and possibly a new hope, I still plan on making a video on EMDR.

However, it's very difficult to say everything that needs to be said in 10-15 min because no one wants to watch a video longer than that lol. [https://youtu.be/9tcI0Ck30yQ](https://youtu.be/9tcI0Ck30yQ)",1

I am writing a zine about my mother's journey with opioid addiction. I'm 26 and she has battled nearly my entire life. Thankfully she is healthy and thriving as of a year and a half ago. I am so proud of her and want to use our story (that is an ongoing fight for the rest of our lives) to encourage others to openly discuss addiction. It can feel so dark and like it needs to be hidden. How isolating! 

I was told horrible and helpful things throughout the years by people who loved me when I shared my mom's struggles. My zine will detail these quotes and how they impacted / helped / hindered me in my own health and support of my mom. 

(A glimpse into the best thing someone ever told me: my teen mentor met up with me for lunch after I got married. They apologized for not advocating for me more and seeking to get the help my brother and I needed. Their honestly spoke such raw love over me.)

If you feel comfortable, I would be honored to share and experience you had with someone giving their unsolicited input or reach out with the perfect words.

31 / M for context if it helps.

It's my 1 year anniversary of starting therapy for severe depression, anxiety, and childhood trauma. As we have progressed through the year I have come to terms with my active involvement in gambling addiction and severe nicotine addiction (2+ packs per day, vaporizers, nicotine mints/gum, snus on a regular basis and 2-3 premium cigars a day when the weather permits). I have a history of sex addiction when I was younger and borderline alcoholism (mostly as a form of passive suicide). Though I don't believe I've hit my ""bottom"" I am slowly coming to term with the trauma these addictions cause myself and others, most importantly my fianc√©.

The past few sessions of therapy I've attended have had a recurring theme of 12 Step programs and whether I am open to the idea. I made good on my promise this week to start reading about it and pick up a devotional book to skim through. The more I read the more I feel a sense of understanding that I truly am an addict (which I guess is how it's supposed to work).

The problem I'm having is there is a nagging feeling that if I take my therapists offer of going to group I will be out of place as I'm neither an alcoholic (runs in the family though) nor a user of any narcotics. My understanding of these groups are that while they deal with the struggles of addiction they are usually specialized in the type of addiction associated with their titles. 

I know that there are resources available for gambling addiction. 

I know sex addiction is slowly becoming more recognized.

I know that nicotine addiction is extremely difficult to kick for the majority of users. 

What I don't know is whether I truly belong in a traditional 12 Step group.

I don't know if I would be accepted.

TL;DR I'm curious to know if anyone has any insight on whether traditional AA/NA groups are right for other addictions.",2

These days it is easy to see the world closing off. With everything that has happened, and continues to happen, in 2020 no one would blame us for closing off a bit. There is nothing in it for us, however.  


Closing off, to not welcome change, or simply offering resistance is no longer an option. There was once a time where saying ""No"" to something new was the easiest way forward, while saying ""Yes"" to toxic friends and relationships also seemed the least intrusive. Today we are more important than that, we are more than that in every way, but we have to step forward in order to experience it, we have to try no matter how much or how little. Changing our lives happens by the slightest shifts so if we can open up just the least amount possible today, tomorrow will be a brand new day.  


We all have to learn how to better say ""No"" to our past and ""Yes"" to our future. This quote from Miles Bingham  is not just for those of us in recovery it is for everyone.",8

Once we identify strongly with something it is not easy to shift away from that. If we identify as a dancer, for instance, it may destroy us to become injured. But injuries happen, and when they do we may very well be resistant to change course due to our how we experience our identity. This can be the same if we identify as a victim. When we find relationships that don't victimize us, we may distance ourselves as we are resistant to the change.  


I am a proponent of having a strong and flexible mind. Working with clients it's important for me to have them become aware of where they have rigid thinking. When we get stuck trying to get hard answers it is often due to an inability to be flexible.  


Being flexible in, and aware of, our thoughts allows us the space to grow beyond our old identities. Keep your mind limber and keep questioning ""Why?"" because having the answer to ""What"" doesn't get us as far as we would be led to believe.

My own experience is more like addictions are maladaptive redirections of willpower. Coping isn't simply about things being bad. When things are bad, that can be used as motivation to make things better. However, it can also be used as motivation to do other unrelated and potentially useless or harmful things to try to feel better.

The narrative about powerlessness over addiction also seems weird to me. Instead the root seems to be ""things are bad, but I feel powerless in making things better, so I'll just do something to feel better instead"". This can be a learned helplessness trauma, creating the impression of powerlessness even where there are ways to make things better. The habit of soothing emotions in addictive ways can help that powerlessness impression to continue.

Healing seems to be about directing willpower in more useful ways.",8

Due to circumstances beyond my control, I had to temporarily move into a shelter until a friend returns so I have somewhere else to go.

At the shelter, while outside having a puff of my vape someone brought out the cocaine, and all clean equipment. 

And I said ""you know what? Fuck it, once won't kill me""

I haven't used since that one shot, but I left the shelter and have been drinking so heavily that I'm now in withdrawal just from that.

In the middle of a detox is going to be one of the hardest steps to reclaim the life your addiction stole from you, there will be suffering. Its the sacrifice of temporary pleasures that only lead to misery and ultimately more suffering. Take joy and strength in knowing this will be the last time you suffer. imagining the person your going to be when this is all over, how its going to feel having your peace of mind back, taking back control.

We met years ago. When I was just a kid. And I admit we did have fun at first. But it wasn‚Äôt long until things got ugly. My family noticed it first, and soon I realized too I had a devil by my side.

Some say I was born with you there. Others say that getting rid of you was as simple as not picking up the phone or showing up at your door. All I know is I have tried one hundred times to kill you, but in the end you won and damn near buried me.

Looking back, you‚Äôve been the cause of a lot of wasted years, a lot of tears. And too much disappointment to begin to count. 

Relationships have been sabotaged. My physical health deteriorated. You fucked up my career, my education, my motivation and my mental state. 

The amount of money I have spent on you makes me absolutely sick. 

I was never able to live up to my full potential having you around. So now it‚Äôs time you go. 

In my heart I always knew I would thrive without you by my side. 

I do not know what the future will bring. But I know won‚Äôt be spent with you. 

I‚Äôm going to trade you for co-workers that respect me, a family that loves me, friends who appreciate me, and a nice girl by my side.

Whatever this life brings I will take it on clear-eyed and sober. 

So goodbye to my addiction. I never liked you anyway. The best years of my life are right in front of me. A farewell has never felt so sweet.",54

just a post to get some advice of my good ol fellow junkies. so to start off ive been using benzos and opiated for 5years straight. ( for the information, i just turned 18 so im pretty young )I went to a detox in last year, was there for 10weeks. My tolerance was that high that it took 8 weeks to get off benzos and opiates. After going trough that missery i said to myself: Now i am really done with it! ( yeah sure...) so full of confidience, feeling better, sitting on my pink cloud thinking i can do everything now im clean. I come up with the amazing idea that while im still in a clinic when i turn 18 i can still use that last time to close this chapter. 

Long story short got a urine screening they caught me with almost everything possible and sent me away to another rehab in africa for 2months. I am homeless, broke and broken at this point, already failed in my eyes with the relapse and this is my last change, last one to fix the trust and pain with my loved ones. Here i really try my best, follow the program, try to change my people places things and thinking patterns etc.
I attend to meeting, do my stepwork and i try to talk to people with a long clean time to see what life is like.

Okayyy, Here is the part i want advice for:

As im sitting here i am in a safehouse with screenings every week. I am on anti depressants and i start feeling better time by time. Problem is lack of motivation. im already sick and tired of life and it didnt even start yet. So i am here sober for 4months now trying to find a life worth living, and if i trust the people around me life will get better, but for me it doesnt the only thing that changed is that now i can feel things again ive always pushes away.

I gave up last night and ordered benzos, opiates and smoked some cannabis yesterday night.

i can start counting again with clean time but i feel just like giving up. Because why working for a life that i am not going to like. Please help me i am desperate and dont know what i can do.

Should I just accept what i did and use again(what i want) and try to quit when i am older or just try again and again untill i see things slightly changing and hoping that that will bring external factors in my life that will motivate me?


I really hope someone can help me or just lift me up or give advice

All I want is to be free.,"I've posted in this forum many times before pleading for help with this. But here I am again, looking for any words of advice that might change the way I think. 

I've used crystal meth daily for more than 3 years now. My addiction really spun out of control once I started administering it by injection (>6 months ago). I have been using a gram every 2-3 days. I tell myself everytime I buy a bag that this is the last time. I research day in and day out about what it's doing inside my brain and look for methods of recovery from it. But once I run out of the stuff it's like a demonic energy takes over me almost right away and my mind becomes a storm of fear, anxiety, and self manipulation. I act on impulses immediately all the time. I know what I should be doing, but I can never act upon it or think with reason once I enter this state.

I have been on a hard bender since Christmas. Prior to it I had made it almost 20 days clean and I actually remember feeling better and the chaos in my life had really gotten more quiet. I have been skipping my support group meetings out of shamefulness and things are starting to darken again. 

I really just cannot live this way anymore, I've gotten myself way too deep in this though. I feel helpless at this point. I really want to think that I do not need rehab and can overcome this without but damn I just don't really know anymore. I want to create a written recovery plan with realistic goals that are achievable. I promise myself I will try my hardest to focus on it with first priority.

If any ex addicts or anyone at all has any stories of what got them free, please ü•∫ I want this so much, I know that my thinking must be changed, but how?",5

I come home from work, and there's people here smoking meth. I wake up in the morning, and those people are still here. I left for a meeting yesterday, and some other random guy that I don't know was smoking meth in the living room. These random ass addicts are always here.

It's his house. I'm just staying here. I can't talk to people at work because he knows everyone in this town, and when he finds out, he'll kick me out. I can't talk about it at meetings, because they know him, and he'll kick me out.

2021-02-14 19:56:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lk1v25/gambling_issues_and_more/,Gambling issues (and more)....,"Posted it already in r/problemgambling but I guess I'm going to share it here also, sorry if I broke any of the subreddit rules.  


I will try to explain this in a way that is short and simple and yet detailed so I'm not sure how long it's going to be really....  


So let's start it off, I have gambling issues and I'm.. reformed gambler which went back to gambling. Basically it started off innocent, literally harmless bet of quite literally few cents no harm or anything.. but it went into a habit.. eventually I realized that the only way to win ""big"" is to bet more money and that's what I've done... (now we're talking about few dollars, again nothing serious).. the issue is that it went into a habit...  


Before I was even aware of it, dollar by dollar it went into few hundred of dollars.. (and eventually it went more and more).... - now to note it, I was strictly spending my own money whatever if it was given to me or I earned it or something else it was never loan or anything like that...  


Eventually my parents figured out that I'm gambling (which is quite ironic considering the fact that they were watching me gamble (online gambling) infront of them for years and completly ignored it and went mad once they realized I'm spending real money).. so we had argument over that and I have agreed to stop it under one condition (which I'm going to mention soon) and I've stopped it, and went even a step further and literally cut anything what could trigger that gambling (what I was able to control) from my life.. and I was reformed for a while, probably over a year.. and well, I've started making daily spins (free daily spins) in one singleplayer game not related to real life or anything whatsoever and it slowly but surely ""triggered"" my gambling addiction back (triggered is a lie, it only unlocked something what I have locked in myself for completly different reasons).. and here I am again with the issues...   


Now, to give a bit of a perspective of what's going on actually... it's not a matter of me gambling for the sake of gambling, the issue is that I have no respect for money whatsoever because I was raised in that way.. living in a very toxic family which thought that money can be replaced with everything, save every cent and penny which you can but at the same time be cocky, drive luxurious vehicles and make sure that everyone else is jelaous of you... and I'm not like that.. I just can't pretend to be something what I'm not.. and it's even more complicated.. basically I'm not in the position to do anything because looking at one point I really need to move away and looking from another I can't because I'm in university and I'm without a job (looking for one) and while they're supposed to still finance me (by the law) through the time while I'm studying, I can't exactly say that they don't but they're again counting every cent and that's what's just driving me crazy and forcing me to gamble and lose respect for the money.. ""oh you need new shirt/jeans? Why the hell did you tear apart old one?"" - well maybe it got torn apart on it's own because it's old damn it? And well, the thing is that toxic behavior was going on way before I started gambling (or for a matter of fact before they had any idea of that whatsoever) and the thing is I just got to the point where I got sick of their money and ""tried getting some of my own"" (by gambling.. which didn't work out too well)...   


How I'm standing right now? Well.. nothing really changed, I'm not in debts or anything like that to worry about but the issue is (as stated) that I don't have any respect for the money... like, let's say I take some money for the coffee or to go out - person didn't show up or cancelled? Throw that money into gambling straight away... and the thing is.. while those are mostly small ammounts if I was to save up the money which I lost those would be some serious figures (which I don't really want to talk about)... and those figures are getting higher and higher because I keep doing the same thing over and over again....  


...another well at the same time issue and solution, honestly saying I don't have motivation to do anything really.. due to situation mentioned above (at home, not gambling) I'm pretty much at breaking point every day and it's been going on for years, so while I am holding it together (not really) at the same time I don't really see a reason in doing anything.. whatever if it's studying, going out, finding a hobby or something... not that I don't want to, I do but like studying for example.. like if I don't study and I don't have any expectations I fail exam and I know why I failed it, but if I do study and fail then.. it's actually a huge dissapointment and I just don't know what to do at that point..   


If someone has some follow up questions please do ask them, but also please do not answer with some hotline number for gambling issues or something like that.. that's why I'm posting it here...",1

Yesterday, I was assaulted by a security officer in a Home Depot parking lot. To give you all some context: back in 2018 I was brutally raped and assaulted and it was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever had to go through. To the point of almost taking my life. I went down a very bad path cause I didn‚Äôt know how to cope. Attempted suicide, turned to drugs, self harm, and more. I was put on SSRIs and anxiety medication. I was admitted to the psych word for a 72 hour hold for slicing my wrist cause of the assault.  I was admitted again for severe panic attacks. And I  was 5150d for a psychotic break down shortly after. It‚Äôs been a rough couple of years. After getting myself to NA and therapy and a psychiatrist, i  eventually clawed my way out of this dark hole and got myself together. I went back to school, was able to get off my medication, and just celebrated 15 months sober. The night terrors were finally going away and I hadn‚Äôt had a panic attack.... 

Until yesterday, all the years I‚Äôve worked towards getting better gone in a matter of minutes. A security lady punched me in the face and threw her body on top of mine. I‚Äôm a small girl. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 and 120 lbs. she must have had 80 lbs on me. And violently attacked me after berating me for ‚Äúrolling‚Äù through a stop sign and almost hitting her. I kept apologizing. I was with my dad and we were talking and I must of been distracted while talking to him but he swears I didn‚Äôt roll through the stop sign and she wasn‚Äôt anywhere near us in the intersection. She wouldn‚Äôt stop yelling in my face and her breath smelled like weed and eventually shoving me to the floor and punching me in the head. I was triggered. Last time someone was on top of me they were punching my face in and raping me violently. When she was pulled off me I felt like I was right back at the night of my rape. 

I relapsed last night and today. I‚Äôve had the worst panic attacks and thoughts. I‚Äôve already called my therapists and I‚Äôm going to go to a meeting tomorrow. I feel so damaged, hopeless and helpless. 

Why do people hurt me. Will I ever get through this trauma? Did I deserve to get attacked for said ‚Äúrolling‚Äù through a stop sign? 

Get this... she wasn‚Äôt even Home Depot‚Äôs security guard. She was the strip malls. Not Home Depot‚Äôs. She didn‚Äôt even have any right to be in their parking lot. After the incident the security company allowed her to go back to work and continue her shift. 
Some witness told the cops that he was there two weeks ago with her wife and she did the same thing to her. 

Can we please be nicer to people. I bet if she had known that I‚Äôm a rape survivor she probably wouldn‚Äôt have hit me. You never know what someone is going through or has been through.",3

First, some background information: I am male, 19 years old and live in Germany (where cannabis is not even allowed. 

My cannabis addiction started in March of last year. 
I did not get the desired school leaving certificate, I did not get a job and sat at home because of the first one  Lockdown. 
So I thought to myself: What do I have to lose? 
So I smoked all the time from morning to evening. This was where the first addiction developed. 
When I got a good school course in August last year, I had to  getting rid of cannabis addiction. 
In trying to escape that addiction I created an even bigger one. 
I tried building joints with more tobacco and less cannabis. And it helped against the canabis. Unfortunately, I became addicted to nicotine. 
I did not question my nicotine use.  But at least the nicotine is not that negative for everyday tasks, so I ignored the addiction, until 2 weeks ago, thats when I realized  how bad it is for me and how little it gets me. 

So I smoked the last cigarette and didn't buy any new ones.  
It was very hard, especially the 2nd and 3rd day.  But it was manageable and I'm happier and richer than ever.",15

I was addicted to smoking from 11yo until my mid 20s. When I quit that, I was very proud of myself and felt I could do anything.

I still drank though, and though it took me years to realize I had a problem, I did have one from my early 20‚Äôs until I landed in the hospital in my early 30‚Äôs just a few months before my wedding. Even that and the known damage it did to my body didn‚Äôt stop me until I found out that I was going to be a father. I quit right away when I learnt that, and I haven‚Äôt drank for 4 years now since then.

But after I stopped drinking, I shopped. Always justifying it as spending money on things that were ‚Äúuseful‚Äù etc, but I just kept buying and buying. Luckily I could afford it, but it was nowhere near the responsible thing to do with my money, and I‚Äôve spent tens of thousands when that could‚Äôve been put to much better use. It got to the point where I faced myself on it, and have cut down and really tried mentally talking myself out of the next purchase etc.. but it‚Äôs still something I‚Äôm struggling with a bit..

And as I make progress on stopping the shopping addiction, the better I do at that, the worse I do with another issue I see developing... emotional eating.

For the past few months I‚Äôve done good spending little to no money buying things, but my eating habits have went out the window and I find myself not just eating out of boredom but also out of despair at times. I really didn‚Äôt notice it for a while until I started gaining weight recently, and I‚Äôve been feeling like I *need* to eat this unhealthy junk food just to get through the day.  It‚Äôs a very weird and new feeling for me, which is why it took me so long to identify it as emotional eating.  It‚Äôs as if the food is regulating my emotions in lieu of other things... and it‚Äôs way harder for me to talk myself out of this for some reason, like my body is on auto pilot and I‚Äôll go out of my way to get something sweet/junky into me just to feel ‚Äúok‚Äù. It‚Äôs scary.

So, I realized I‚Äôm just an addict. To what? Everything it seems. As soon as I conquer one thing another one pops it‚Äôs head... and yes My parents had addiction issues and yes I‚Äôve had l early trauma that I went through therapy for, so I understand how it can be related but... here I am just wondering to myself...

Can it ever really end? Will it ever end? Is it possible? Will I ever get to be the person I really want to be?",2

It's because our family expects the best of us and loves us. But if I were to tell the random guy at the grocery store I am an addict he would say ""I'm praying for you, and I hope things get better for you."" But if I was to tell my mom she would be like ""how could you?"" ""When are you ever going to learn."" Or worse ""I disown you.""

I just don't understand. I know parents have tough love for their children, but hell if you have an adult child suffering treat them like one. Not like a person who brought shame unpon the family. We need you to love us. Not tell us how disappointed you are. 

If some random person could reach out and say positive things for us instead of beating us down why can't our own family do the same? I bet you there are people who refused to go to treatment because they are scared of what their own family will say to them. 

Come on parents, we are people too. We know you love us. It's time you look at us like a stranger would and stop tearing us down!!",6

When I relapsed this time around, there was no warm up period. Almost immediately I was back at my worst. This time around though, my mind wasn‚Äôt ready for it and I began experiencing drug endured psychosis without doing large quantities of drugs. I think the time sober and going to the gym every day got me healthy for the first time in my life. So when the drugs were reintroduced, it sent shock waves through my healing brain. The last couple months have been daily use of meth and heroin. I kept telling myself that I wasn‚Äôt using very much heroin, but when I stopped, my withdrawals were horrendous. I have been living in denial of how much I have been using. My girlfriend caught me in the act of trying to cop a sack today and took me home empty handed. Like watching a storm roll in from the distance, I started withdrawing from both my drugs of choice. My body and mind were being ripped in different directions. The anxiety is so extreme that I thought I was going to break my fingers from pulling and bending them so much. There was no more down playing how much I have been using when the severity of detoxing makes it obvious. And this is only the beginning of my detox. This is a pointless post but I know there are people out there that get it. Unless you have stated into the abyss and had to fight off the demons, you don‚Äôt get the hell that comes with kicking a habit. I just wanted to tell anyone out there that needs to hear it, you are loved and you are worth it. I hope everyone has a safe and happy night.-",2

It just feels like this will be an endless cycle. I knew quitting Kratom, a huge crutch I leaned on getting off both meth and Suboxone in late 2018....

First, when I met my boyfriend, I knew he was addicted to cannabis, but it didn't really bother me. The problem now is that he can't have access to cannabis when he wants.

Indeed, when we met, he has just begun to stop to deal cannabis, and has just begun to have a legal job. He said meeting myself has motivated him more to stop to be a dealer : he knew it is the best for him and I said since the beginning that I can't accept to be with a dealer. 

When he was a dealer, he could have access to all the cannabis he ""needed"". Then, with his legal job (15-20h/week I think), he got a lot less money, but it was ok for buying his consommation. Sometimes, at the end of the month, he would ask me 20-30 euros to buy his drug, it was ok since he would refund me next month.

But, in december, his contract ended, so no money anymore. He has find a new work that will star on Tuesday. His parents are poor and know about his consommation, but can't pay for a the drug he needs : he smokes for 20 euros of cannabis in 2-3 days. So, as I am financially ok, he asks me to pay... I think I have spend around 250 euros if not more. It is a lot since I am a student. My parents can give me money if I ask, but I don't want to always enjoy of them.

I use the verb ""need"" since he becomes totally crazy when he doesn't have his cannabis for 1 day or more... he becomes very aggressive, and suicidal. He says cannabis help to calm his mind, since he had a very difficult childhood and traumatic memories. 
So, when I can't help him he always talk about become a dealer again and leave me so I wouldn't have to deal with him selling drug.

What makes me write espacially tonight ? This afternoon, he asked me if I could help him : but I had no money on me since I have lost my credit card, I have to wait next week to receive it. Then, he canceled our Saint-Valentine's night because he said he would walk around the city to find drug. Finally, he didn't find cannabis. But when he went home he became totally crazy and said it was over between us. Morever, he made me the reproch to not have him given my personal consommation : I had some weed on my pocket (I spoke very occasionnaly on a more therapeutical way)... I didn't gave him since I knew it wouldn't last long enough for him.

I don't know if I am asking for help or whatever, I am just very sad and even if I know he is addicted, I feel like secondary to his cannabis. It is the first guy that really loves me and cares about me, my heart is broken.",7

Brief background... recovering H addict, it‚Äôs been about 7 years since I‚Äôve touched the stuff. I‚Äôm approaching a year since I last had a hiccup with some benzos I found. 

For whatever reason I seem to have a spike in vulnerability this time of year. Perhaps it‚Äôs the weather, I‚Äôm an avid outdoorsman and hate being stuck inside. Maybe I‚Äôve developed an association with February and using..

I don‚Äôt have any connections at this point, but I have come up with a plan. I work in an industry that necessitates testing our products in a myriad of chemicals. My plan is/was to get ahold of a chemical that is a precursor to a (fairly) well known street drug. I know that it‚Äôs probably a bad idea, but the concept of having something that I could use every once in a while is appealing; it‚Äôs been stuck in my head for 3 days now.

(we had to make sure the house was safe before leaving) that being said we highly doubt anyone was there and his paranoia was taking over which wouldn't surprise me if it came from doing cocaine like a mad man. me and buddy talked for a while after the second call where he claimed again people were at his door. we think its a sign that he need help and bad. now we go to friend 2 this guy does coke like a mad man hes the true addict but he never wants to do it alone and that's when friend 1 gets pulled in (and its bad like that, peer pressure to the max)  during red phases here in our province they both went out to do coke and stay up all night during lockdown and these guys couldn't wait a week till it was over they were ready to risk it all. that action there cost friend 1 to get kicked out of his house. We are at this point today none of their parents know about any of it completely oblivious to it all (doesn't help that friend 1 relationship with his parent is toxic as fuck) we want to give them help bad but we aren't sure what will work or how to go about it. but something needs to happen tho and fast.

Sure I may have made the choice to pick up but I didn‚Äôt choose my body and mind to be addicted to it craving about it thinking abt it 24/7 and even my choice to use in the first place wasn‚Äôt because I wanted to party or have fun it was because I wanted to escape my own fucking head

I have no support system I have like 2 friends, and trust me I do take accountability for my drug use I am well aware the role I play in my self destruction. I may be wrong but I feel like that‚Äôs just a piece of the puzzle.

I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a never ending shame cycle with no love or support. I know so many people have it much worse than me and I‚Äôm sorry. I really just wish I was dead than I cld break free of this fucking cycle bc the guilt and shame are fucking overbearing",10

Besides having a sip of a drink with the family, I have never had my own glass. And well yeah I fucked up pretty bad. I like this girl a lot and she said she had a glass of wine in her hands. I wanted to seem cool and to fit in with her so I said, ""wait for me to get a drink too"". While my parents were sleeping I ran into a cabinet with some drinks. Like the stupid kid I am, I grab the first thing I see, Buffalo whiskey stuff. I poor a lot into a cup again not knowing the amount. I think it was like as much as a soda can. So I run to my computer, and we have a great time. I don't think she actually had some, cause she seemed pretty normal, and she said she chugged it. I mean maybe she did but my goodness. So I take my first sip, and let me say it was so gross. Burned my throat. I started to down it and I almost barf. We continue to talk and then I feel bad. I'm sweating, and I don't feel good. I decide to call my 18 year old friend who is a pro drinker (at 18). She gives me the sleep on stomach advice. I eventually go to bed at 4am. I wake up at 9 due to class, and I feel awful. Like I can't describe the feeling, as if my head was 10000lbs, and I was in like multiple worlds and time was going fast. A bad headache is another word for it. So, I get through class and here I am now writing this. I feel better now, after I had whiskey, I drank two soda cans, and ate a whole family sized Dorito pack (I'm super bony idk how i did). I am having a strong urge to get more. My family has a big addiction problem, many relatives died from addiction. I am nervous. I don't want people to find out, but I can't continue this.

basically drank lots of whiskey to impress girl I liked, and I feel awful... I am now struggling with the idea of getting more...I take advice of any kind, whether its getting away, addiction, impacts on health at a young age, etc",1

Her addiction has always been a huge struggle for her and I think she has been clean maybe for the most a month or two, although she tried to hide her addiction so I can‚Äôt say for certain how long her longest is. 

Most recently, me and my grandfather went to check on her as we couldn‚Äôt get a hold of her in the morning and found she had overdosed and had to call emergency services and perform CPR. She is currently still in hospital but is hopefully getting out soon.

2021-02-12 12:29:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lify0a/interesting_how_addiction_reveals_how_broken_my/,Interesting how addiction reveals how broken my brain is.,"I'm addicted to stimulants. What makes this so difficult is that I have ADHD and stimulants are the most successful treatment for me. Without my medication, I crawl through life in a fog. I was also at risk for addiction since my father is an addict and my mother used to be an addict (she sobered up years ago, passed in 2019 due to unrelated reasons). 

I started stims in highschool for ADHD and they were the best thing to happen to me. I had a lot of side effects, but it made me so productive and astute I didn't want to go back. I was responsible with my medication during this time. I also took the suggested breaks.

It all went downhill when I got into college. I stopped taking breaks, because I wanted to feel what I felt on the medication all the time. My tolerance went through the roof. I was no longer as good as a student as I was in highschool and it drove me mad. I upped my doses, I switched medications. 

Somewhere, more recently, I lost control. I repeatedly blew through my medication despite telling myself that I won't. It's so aggravatingly simple. Just take one pill a day like I'm supposed to. Easy as that. So I do that. Then take another pill a couple of hours later, sometimes two... knowing I shouldn't. Like I'm broken.

It got so bad I blew through 30 pills in a week and a half and finally fessed up to my dad what was going on. He now keeps my medication in a safe and gives me one pill a day. After a month of this, I asked for them back, just to see if I can be normal... and failed, so they're back in the safe. 

I just feel like I'm utterly made wrong. I don't know why I can't just do the smarter thing. I'm an otherwise intelligent and bright person. I should know better. I should be better. But I'm not.",19

I have a plan to stop soon, but I'm at a point where I don't even know that I believe it'll last. IDK if I even care.","I like the money I'd have if I didn't use. I liked the amazing job that I lost. I liked the car I had that I had just finished paying off. I love my SO, who doesn't use and is one of the only people that knows that I use Opiates. Two of my friends know but they think I've been sober for over a year. No one in my family knows, and I also like that.     


I still have enough money for bills and rent. I am currently collecting unemployment from the job I lost. I used the money from the car I totaled (plus 3000 more) to buy the same car, except 3 years newer and with 40% less miles. My SO is still with me and wants to help me get clean (again). My friends are awesome and trust me. My family couldn't even begin to imagine how much I've used.   


I haven't really had consequences. Not really. I lost my job, but for now I'm making a similar amount of money from unemployment. I also get monthly disability pay for being a disabled veteran (I'm physically fine, it's basically anxiety issues). I've also been supplementing my income by taking advantage of other peoples addiction - playing poker. I'm playing a lot now that I don't have my job, and I'm confident in paying against any players at the lowest stakes (60$ minimum / 300$ maximum buy in) but I do seek out the weakest and drunkest competition.     


I snort my fentanyl and that's always how I've used it. The last time I got clean I really thought it was going to hold. I made it 5 months and I felt good. I pretty much use for maintenance at this point, and the only time I get a really good feeling from using is when I sleep. If I sleep 8+ hours I wake up feeling like crap, and those first lines of the day ‚Äì my morning coffee sort of ‚Äì make me feel amazing. That might not be the most accurate way to word that. I don't actually feel amazing, I feel amazing compared to how I felt before I used. The contrast is what makes it seem so great.   


I've gotten sober plenty of times and I know I can again, but I lost the confidence that I used to have that I would stop and stay stopped. But I don't even feel like I'm getting high at this point. I feel no better then I felt when I had been sober for a few months. When I'm sober for a few months, I know that if I use then I will actually get a real high out of it. That's the only reason that resembles logic I can come up with for why I go back to using. I work pretty hard to stop people from knowing I use and if you asked me I would honestly say I would prefer being sober. This is not sustainable long term. It's sustainable only for the rest of my life, which I know will fall apart completely at some point. I have never overdosed, but that streak could end at any time.     


I feel like I haven't had consequences and I've let myself be a baby about it all. If I've been sober for some time and I feel like using I just do it. Why not? So dumb!   


I have about 30 strips/pills of suboxone and I'm going to pick up more. I plan to stop when I run out, which should be in a bit over a week. When I stop I usually sleep for like a day. I'll sleep as long as I can, then toss and turn for as long as I can, then wait a while more and start taking subs. I've found I need about 24 Mgs for the first 7-14 days, and I try to take it as spread out as I can. The less I take the easier it is to stop taking (this has been my experience). Once I can start taking less I can cut down to zero pretty quickly. Whole process takes about 3-4 weeks iirc, Each time is a bit different.   


I really want this to work. I totaled my car when I was ‚Äúsober‚Äù. My car flipped and ended up on its side. I had no injuries at all. Seat belt gave me a nice little bruise while it was saving my life but other then small scratches that didn't even bleed, I was completely unharmed. I had brown and white on me that at first I put in my sock, then decided to toss into the bushes between the guardrails. I got a warning from the cop ‚Äì not even a ticket. THANKFULLY no one else/no other cars were involved and I was alone.   


Whenever I go ANYWHERE I have to go off to the bathroom about once an hour. At poker today I thought I had forgot my to-go stash. I remembered I had a backup in my car so I didn't have to leave after playing until I started to feel withdrawal take over. They only have one stall so I have to make several trips sometimes and I can't help but think that someone will catch on. Masks definitely help not show a red or runny nose though, and I try to be careful about making sure I clear the snot from my nose without that being noticed.   


There are so many things ‚Äì small and big ‚Äì that I end up having to account for to keep using and not be noticed. I really wanted to pull out my bag with straw and juts snort at the table because fuck it. I've snorted at the urinal a few times when the stall is in use.   


I used to not only do drugs in the bathroom at work, but at my desk too. I stopped snorting while driving. I don't know why though ‚Äì as strange as that sounds. On my drive home from work I used to snort coke and fen, and I'd turn my laptop on and use my cell to connect to internet, and I'd hop into like a 10$ tournament online. There was absolutely no good reason for this except a kind of fuck it mode where I just didn't care. I was drinking and driving a lot more at that point in time also. So the progress that I've made in the past few years is I stopped snorting while driving, I've greatly cut back on drunk driving and stopped drinking while driving, and I'm no longer playing poker on my laptop or watching YouTube on my phone while driving.     


Sorry for the rant. I never get to be this honest. That's my choice I guess but it's tough to imagine talking like this to anyone that's not being paid to listen. Even when talking to a therapist I would somewhat edit what I say. I'm aware they take notes and from reading their notes (they're available to you), it's caused me to be increasingly aware of what I'm saying   


I would appreciate any thoughts, feedback or criticisms. I had no clue what to expect but it was nice to just write that out.",7

I've made a couple of attempts to get clean in the past (made it as long as 4 months sober once), but I always ended up failing because I never anticipated the hell that is addiction withdrawal. I wasn't prepared for the PAWS. I wasn't prepared for the unbearable dopamine deficit. And I wasn't prepared to face the problems and emotions I was using the drugs to mask. 

I truly believe this time will be different because I now understand exactly what I will go through. I can anticipate the thoughts, feelings, and experiences I will encounter on the long, painful journey to becoming the better version of myself.  I made a list of ""things to keep in mind"" which I plan to read over each day. I wanted to share it in here because I... a) want to see if any of you have any input or additions I need to add, and b) believe it could help anyone fighting a similar battle.

1. It's going to be hard, and it will probably continue to get harder for some time. Be tough and be patient. It *will* eventually get easier. 
2. Your productivity will suffer. Your mood will suffer. Don't freak out. This is okay. It is *only temporary*, and it will be worth it in the end. 
3. Be content with the lack of productivity and focus on making it through each day. Work is not important right now. Your social life is not important right now. Detox is the top priority in your life. 
4. You will have thoughts that your life was better with drugs. *It wasn't*. Don't be deceived by these thoughts. It is *because* of the drugs that you are in a dark spot. This is the reason you're quitting.
5. Always remember that freedom is on the other side. Freedom from dependence, freedom from frequent unnecessary spending, and freedom from the masked version of yourself that's hiding the real, great version of yourself. No more needing *this* to do *that*. No more crash. You can be you *all the time*. You can do what you want to do *all the time*.

Going to an inpatient facility as soon as a bed opens up to deal with my sober mind. Daily weed is an addiction and daily pharmaceuticals are a medicine.

It always seems easier to just lie the whole ordeal away, but Christ what a web to get caught up in. One lie just take the other and suddenly it's all just lies. I truly hate myself right now for decieving the few people I still have around me, but honesty isn't my best trait. 

I've been an addict all my life, so lying has just become sort of normal, and I've actually never really felt bad about it before, but after rehab and now trying to stay clean, the shame of lying is just unbearable. I really wish to just tell the true, take this weight of me, but I'm so freakin' scared that the last people in my life will turn away from me, again. Not only have I relapsed, but I have told lies straight to their faces as well, which is probably much worse than a stupid short relapse.

I don't know how to fix this without risk of losing it all - and maybe that'll just be the price of my stupidity - but none the less will I have to do so. Any advice on how I do so best??",8

The time between waiting for a new prescription was misery for myself and anyone around me. Lucky for me, I‚Äôd become an avid runner during this time (around 2017) and have consistently logged 30-70 miles a week since. But I lost jobs, damaged friendships, and lost my gf of 4 years because of the person it changed me into. It took me years to realize I‚Äôd even become addicted to it, was completely oblivious to my behaviors and the selfishness that‚Äôd become of me. 
I quit after my relationship ended. I also quit my job and entered a field I found my calling in; teaching and coaching. I began going back to school. I was thriving and I was happy; yet for whatever reason, I went back to and re-lapsed after 5 months. My family moved back home after living across the country for 4 years and I moved in with them to save money and to be with them. My 3 year old nephew, sister, and brother in law moved into the same household too after moving back home. During this time, my irritability has peaked, moods ebb and flow, and I‚Äôve become very detached from everyone. 

The hard part: none of them have a clue about my addiction. And it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm ashamed of, to tell anybody really. 

Three days ago, I had a light bulb moment in my head appear and realized that this has to end. I got rid of my Adderall, but I knew I would endure a rough road ahead. But I want to stop living a lie and be the ‚Äúreal me‚Äù. Not the person this drug turns me into. I know if I go back to it, that I will never be the best version of myself. I know how powerful/positive of a figure and influence I can be in teaching and coaching if I am my true self. That is my motivation as I thoroughly enjoy and get a high from teaching and coaching.

I wish I was ashamed, I wish I didn't want to do this  but if I'm being completely honest, I welcome this dark turn in my life with welcome arms.

I‚Äôm just coming to terms with this but I have been addicted to porn for the last 2-3 years at the least. It all started when I was in a relationship with my ex gf, porn caused me to crave new kinks and want other women. I began to neglect my gf and distance myself from her, I essentially showed her no love or affection and I was using her as a vessel to fulfill my kinks (looking back at this I‚Äôm horrified I want to cry) I was also chasing other women. Of course she broke up with me which destroyed me mentally. I tried everything in my power to change myself and become a better more self-aware person which has somewhat worked since I am here right now. What I failed to acknowledge was my porn use however, after the breakup my use went up and I‚Äôve been addicted ever since. Looking back I think I can attribute my porn addiction to some of the problems I‚Äôve been having. 

‚Ä¢Major Depression 

‚Ä¢Anxiety which I first noticed last year as my porn use peaked. Going up to a cashier gives me so much anxiety now, that was never a problem before I could even chat it up with them now I just go straight to self checkout from fear :(

‚Ä¢ No type of self-worth I constantly tell myself I‚Äôm not good enough for certain things.  

‚Ä¢ Lack of motivation to talk to women or start friendships as a matter of fact. I brushed it aside telling myself that I‚Äôm too young to even be wasting my time with women and that I should just be focused on myself and school but in reality that was just me being a coward. 

‚Ä¢ Athletically I‚Äôm worse than I‚Äôve ever been. I can‚Äôt run like I used to, I can‚Äôt move like I used to and I can‚Äôt enjoy gym time anymore I just dread it. I‚Äôm just so tired I can‚Äôt do these things. 

‚Ä¢ Lack of concentration in school, I can‚Äôt read for shit I get so bored reading books and taking notes when that used to be so easy to me. I can‚Äôt pay attention to my zoom calls either. 

‚Ä¢ Overall I just feel like I‚Äôm drifting through my life right now. I think if my teenager self were to meet me he‚Äôd be very ashamed. I used to have aspirations for life there was so much I wanted to do as a highschooler and I‚Äôve accomplished nothing. I‚Äôm behind in college credits, I have very little money in my bank account. I live with my parents and have no plans to move out despite wanting to very badly. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is all due to my porn addiction but I firmly believe porn is responsible for my depression and anxiety which in turn has given me all these problems. I‚Äôm currently 2 days free of porn but man I‚Äôm desperate to change my life I‚Äôm desperate to have energy and get shit done I‚Äôm tired of being 20 and feeling like I‚Äôm 70. Any help is appreciated.",5

Sorry it's a long story, but feel free to give any advise or criticism if you like.","So I have an addiction to weed. I cannot go a day without smoking weed and I feel like I need it to get through my day.  I use so I can get some peace of mind, so the storm in my head stops and I can finaly let go of everything that doesn't matter. So I can have some rest in my body aswell. 

I started smoking around 15 years old (21 now almost 22). I was in a toxic relationship I won't go in to much detail about it, but after a year it finaly ended and I kept smoking because it helped me forget about him en relax. It wasn't daily in the beginning, but then I turned 18 and I could buy and consume weed legally. My friends smoke, so it became something we did together at this point it was already weekly. Then I made the mistake of moving out and not having my mom around (parents are divorced and my dad is also addicted to a lot of things, I don't even know it all) I had the freedom to smoke everyday. 

I never felt happier or more relaxed. I could handle my feelings, I wasn't as bad tempered  as I used to be and I became addicted. 

Just before my addiction I was diagnosed with depression and since I have also been diagnosed with a disorder that prevents me from having a normal controle over my emotions. I don't know the English name but litterally translated it would be Emotions Regulation Disorder and last month with ADHD. To add on that I also have a buch of trauma.  I know a great mix of shit and something that probably sounds familliar to a dagree. 

(But I never pittied myself and never wanted pitty, something I personly find import to add)

I want to start my ADHD medication, but my therapist won't allow me to start it before I get of my addiction. She and the head psychiatrist are afraid I will end up in a psychoses so the only option I have is to stop smoking. 

It upset me, it made me cry and I was extremely mad at myself. This was last Wednesday and since then I have made my peace, I'm not angry anymore, I really wanna do this and not just to start my medication, I want to do this for me

I want to stop and I will stop. I have already cut back a lot since last week. I smoked between 0,7 to 1,5 gram per day and now it's between 0,3 and 0,5 grams. I also didn't smoke after I got home from that appiontent, somthing I would have usualy done, I'm already proud of this change and I hope I can keep this up. 

My therapist and I are gonna look at rehab sessions that might help me and make a concrete plan.

I'm very hopefull and very happy that I'm doing this. I will succeed.",2

I'm 31 and I've been drinking heavily for about 8 years, I also smoke weed every day, use about 30mg of nicotine (pouches) a day, and take 45mg of Adderall. I have a prescription for the Adderall for my ADHD, and I'm in my last semester of my undergraduate degree(s). I'm taking 21 credits, have a killer GPA, and start my first job on an archaeological dig site in a week. So I've been getting away with it (kinda), but I think it's almost time to pay the piper.

I've always known my relationship with alcohol has been unhealthy. I've said/done things I didn't mean, been in countless fights, and even crashed my cousin's truck into a mountain once. I've tried to quit/take a break dozens of times. Sometimes those ""breaks"" have even lasted a month, though it's been 3 years since the last time I made it into the double digits of sobriety. The past year with Covid has been especially tough because I got laid off, started online school, and gained like 20 lbs.

Here's the thing: for almost a year my stomach has been feeling pretty messed up, but the last month or so it's gotten BAD. ""Why don't you go to the doctor?"" one might ask. The truth is, I don't have health insurance and I haven't for years. On top of that, I don't want to jeopardize any of my future (jobs, gun purchases, etc.) by having the ""alcoholic"" label on my medical records. (idk how that works, I've just heard rumors) I think it could be gastritis.

I have 2 massive exams today, and feel like I can barely sit up straight let alone process test questions. Are there any ""quick fixes"" for intense stomach pain? I took some ibuprofen and could barely finish a yogurt. Any advice would be appreciated. Any.",2

I was too smart for my own good as a kid and for many things it didnt benefit me. Over time it progressed in the amount of times i would do it in a day  and it became a regular thing to do it 2-5 times a day sometimes more. This has been regular since about being a junior in hs, im 23 now. Ive had relationships, or can even get girls if i try.. i can literally get pussy and still choke the chicken the same day . Im not so much addicted to porn, i can go w/o it but i know they both aid one another. But im not spending hrs on porn type stuff. I jusy chronically enjoy nutting edging.  
For about 5 years ive wanted to stop. The longest ive gone w/o fapping is a week. And that was about a month ago. Im trying to pursue a path through my faith and have wanted to so long but its like im in bondage to this vice . My soul wants to cut the addiction but my flesh says otherwise. This is a hard addiction because its not like one you can easily talk about it to people around you. 

Any people who deal or have dealt with this ? Or addiction in general, how can i free myself from this addiction i really feel like its my daily battle above anything in everyday life.",1

At day 28 I made another decision to stop what I was doing and do the right thing. I was in the process of relapse I was mentally relapsed already and moving on to physically relapse. At this point, I made myself accountable. I gave all my shit I was going to sell to my Mom and told her under NO circumstance to let me leave the house. This was when I feel like the obsession was really lifted. The next day the obsession was more or less gone. This was because I had put myself in a position where I cannot relapse. If you can make yourself **accountable.** Give cash to a trusted individual. Don't put yourself in those situations in early recovery.

Another way I have been taking action is by working the steps. I have been working daily to grind out these steps. Doing the work makes living soberly tolerable. I also by my own accord decided to read a back chapter from some of the literature every night. This helps me in incalculable ways. I can truly say **it does get better. Hang in there. Do the work and the results were present themselves.**",4

So basically I invent new challenges to conquer.
Like my literally I think from the age of 7 I've been just plowing forward no fucks given.

The plus side is = there's nothing like winning.

The minus side is = idgaf about anything else.

If something is easy = I won't even look at it.
But tell me something can't be done and I'll prove you wrong, regardless if it takes me years to achieve = I will prove you wrong.
Any challenge is personal and I will win.

So you see, as I only have my eyes on the future and the outcome = I ignore almost 100% of what is here.
Even the good things that would help me, like getting a girlfriend, relaxing, living stress free or something along those lines.

Not to mention I don't fit in anywhere except (maybe prison 50-50 or with criminals but even then it's a group thing and if we go at something we must all be on the same level to accomplish greatness) because normal people don't seem to be hyper-competitive.

I don't use drugs, altho I like acid and Rc's.
Cocaine turns me into a monster so I don't use it.
Basically I don't use drugs because stimulants = I don't need.
And downers = slow me down and I'm uncomfortable slowing down.

What I'm saying is: I've won in life, there are no more interesting challenges because I'm used to quick reaction to unexpected situations where you either think fast or you're fucked.

So right now I don't know what to say but I think I'd like to slow down but how.

Like imagine every good thing is waiting for you on the other side - just stop surviving and thriving.

It's come to a point where I view anything what people find normal as an unnecessary luxury i.e. "" I can manage without it"", things like money and stuff.
Basically very stubborn and aggressive towards anything.",0

First time in this subreddit. My ex-gf (we're still in touch) has a substance abuse history, and recently she had an episode with Ambien where she lost her dog (thankfully it found its way home). She gave her parents part of her stash of Ambien, and said she couldn't bear to part with all of it. I convinced her to give me the rest.

My question now is, what do I do with it? Do I throw it away? Do I offer to supervise her next time she absolutely needs it?

And do I take a firm stance with her or an empathetic approach?

2021-02-08 21:08:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lfs1qb/one_week_until_rehab_ghb/,One week until rehab (GHB),"Hi everyone,

I've never felt so divided on something in my life. I live in the Netherlands so I am in no place to complain about drug policy and healthcare here. Im 28 years old and have been using xtc, speed, weed, ketamine, 2CB, LSD and GHB recreationally for about 10 years on festivals and afterparties. I never had any problems with addiction, im the only one in my group of friends that doesn't even smoke. I've always concidered myself someone who is extremely lucky (I have the best friends, a loving family and I would be the one who would find 50 euro's on a nights out etc).

Untill two years ago when my eight year relationship ended out of nowhere, I lost 3 young patients at work (19, 4 and 4) after horrific long resucitation and having to inform their parents , I had to move back in with my parents and my cat died (that last one may seem rediculous to mention to some but I loved that furry satan so much). 

I noticed that especially GHB and speed helped me suppress the worst feelings that I had. The GHB kept me in a dream like state where all my problems seemed way less worse and the speed kept me awake so I wouldn't have to lie in bed and have all my depressing thoughts rush through my head. I was diagnosed with depression and PTSD (the PTSD symptoms manifested in the sudden feeling of warm blood on my hands like with my patients, the smell of the hospital room or beeping sounds like the monitors or ECG machine). After almost a year of living with my parents the situation became so bad that my parents (that love me a lot a I love them) told me to seek help or they would kick me out on the street). I had been using GHB and speed non stop since I lived there and they found me KO twice, which must have been horrible as parents to see your son like that...

I got help from my GP and managed to get sober at home with diazepam and got myself a house. I got sober for 7 months, but after 1 month the pandemic started and I felt an obligation to start helping. I got a job as an intensive care nurse at the local hospital during the first wave where I lost patients daily. This in combination with the untreated depression, PTSD and self-quarantining meaning I didn't see any of my friends and family for months resulted in my house becoming a disgusting mess and me quitting my job once I noticed I couldn't handle daily life without drugs. I quit before I started using again because the last thing I would want is me endangering my patients because of me not being sober.

At the start of this year my house was filled with garbage, including pissbottles and thrash up to the knees....My neighbours started hearing weird sounds coming from my house and were worried something was wrong and rang the bell a few times but no one opened the door. They called the police and by the time they arrived I was ""sober"" enough to hear the doorbell, so I opened the door. They told me they could clearly see that I was under the influence of something and that they were worried about my safety. When they stepped inside and asked me why I was living like this and what the white powder and the glass of GHB was I broke down. They immediatly called the psych crisis line and got me a meeting with a psychiatrist and refused to leave my house untill I got a good friend or family member to come over. I called my sister and my best friend and since they know I slowly started telling the rest of my friends and family. All of them reacted in the best way possible and support me in the times to come.

I've been waiting until the 15th of feb, this is my admission date in a clinic. I'm scared for what is to come and I feel so guilty. Guilty over making my loved ones worry about me, about having to seek medical attention during a time that the healthcare system is already under an enormous amount of stress and about fucking up my health and future. I love taking care of friends and patients and have not really been able to for the last 2 years. And I hate having to be looked after. The thing that also haunts me is that for the last month the psych and my GP told me to continue to use GHB because of the dangers of stopping without medical attention. This is resulting in me using non stop longer then I have ever used before. I feel like this is making the process of quitting harder then it is going to be...I have to stop writing now because this post is becoming way longer then I intended to be, even though I already left a lot out that I wanted to tell...If you have made it all the way to the end, thanks for reading. And If you want to talk or vent about your situation, you can always send a message!

Whatever your situation might be, you are loved and we need to stick together <3

It is tough sometimes trying to explain to others why I'm not drinking. My wife took a month break with me but now is casually drinking on the weekends which doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I think the reason being is that I am determined to hit my goals paying off debt and getting a better job. Even though this is delayed gratification I am trying to stay focused on the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Even though I love beer, I'm contemplating if i'm better off not drinking again even after hitting my goals because I had gotten to the point of not being able to stop after just 1 or 2 drinks. 

To anyone who is having a tough time, YOU GOT THIS! Set some clear goals and try to stay active and refocus on better things. I have been slowly trying to get healthier and i'm pretty proud of where I am but know that there's a long road ahead.

It started as getting money from a car accident insurance settlement. Then another insurance settlement came along. I blew both of them on piercings and jewelry and computers and technology and dumb shit. I spend a lot of money on friends so they would know i love them. But I'm 24 and have 25k in debt. (no student loans or anything. Just credit card debt.) I have a justification about everything I buy. And then I stare at it like it's a novel thing. I use it once and then I go to sleep and hate myself that I just cannot seem to control my spending. It's embarrassing. 

How do I fix this. I will try anything I need help. Please anything.",1

I've been using meth most days for the last three weeks. I was 4 years clean before this. My brother came back from rehab with a habit, and he offered me a deal. Every day I have off I just sleep and hate myself. I've blown off work a fair amount, stopped college before I even restarted. And am broke 90percent of the time and recently got a stupid quick cash loan too get more. It's put me in debt  I feel the dopamine damage and loath having to go through withdrawal and recovery. It took me over a year to recover in the past. And 5 months of that was in long term rehab. I can't tell my family as I fear being booted out of the house. They are supportive. They've just recently dealt with a string of chronic weed relapses by me resulting in detox, some of that was also benzo withdrawal. I can honestly get suicidal when I think of what I've screwed up. I need a purpose and a way out. Im only 23 but I feel trapped in the drug lifestyle and can't continue on like this for much longer. I just wanna backtrack to three too four weeks ago where I was a month clean off of everything. Motivated and loving my life and family. I'm in extreme guilt now, I have a strong relationship with my little brother but can't hang out with him over the guilt of constantly letting him down. This sounds depressing but I needed somewhere to say this. I have hope for myself. I just need too go to meetings again and start doing stuff that's healthy. It's just so hard. I feel like I'm in a hole and the only way out is too keep using but that only brings me back further down in my comedowns. I wanna enjoy playing video games like I absolutely loved without this god aweful substance in my body. I wanna be able too talk to my little brother guilt free. And I want out of my situation where im constantly surrounded by drugs. How long u reckon till you get your energy back from meth abuse (I've been through this before but really had no care about my energy levels at the time, and it took a seriously long time. What should I do too build back up my dopamine that's not just other drugs, nootropics ECT.  I wanna excersise but I just can't get out of bed sober.

If newdazeduser is reading this tho - thanks dude.


What an amazing story! 

Really cool of you to share as I can relate at least partially. It's rare to see someone being objecive about drugs - usually it's the extremes - either ""drugs are hell, only dirty junkies do it, eww"" or ""fuck yeah, drugs rule!"" (some variations in the middle e.g. ""weed/shrooms are ok, but the rest (synthetic stuff) is satan's pus-filled asshole."").

I'm not in the same shoes for sure (meaning I'm not pretending to fully relate), but got a similar thing with speed/coke. I'm an addict for approx. 5 years now and can legit say that doing speed at work has helped a lot (not to mention free time - video games, parties with friends, sex/wanking being 3x more pleasurable etc) - I already kinda love what I do, but with speed I was confident (in a non-arrogant way), productive, had fun doing mundane shit and had ideas that pass the scrutiny of sober-me with flying colors. I'm hiding it well of course and I'm making 10-15x the minimum salary in my country, which I appreciate with total gratefulness. But I also know it's (the drugs) destroying my life in a slow-but-sure downslide- way.

Had a 6 month pause recently (I'm 31, it was like a year ago) and I literally want to cry thinking about it - I was truly, profoundly happy for the first and only time in my life. Not that I'm all gloom n doom in general (I mean I am kinda, but not in public lol) but I do lean more on the depression/shit self esteem side of things). Not just euphoric - joyful, calm, confident, working out, waking up at 6am w/o an alarm etc.

Now I'm using again for a year approx - this time its not weekly 3-day binges (no food, no sleep at all) and then a horrible comedown - this time it's daily use with eating and sleeping in between (obv less than normal) and I'm kinda scared it's gonna be so much harder to get out this time even tho I don't reach the crazy highs as for the 3 years before the 6mth thing. I can kinda see it's mark on my face too - I'm starting to look really tired.

I am planning on taking a 3 day vacation next week just so I can come down and wallow in my head-shit in peace. I guess I just wanted to share and maybe if anyone has any tips, I would really appreciate it (I do have a narcologist (is that the word?) and am planning on therapy.

Tim hopes nobody finds who he really is. But without a resource like a licensed therapist or in patient center, has no choice but to get some kind of feedback.

Tim is 31.25 years old. His parents married and divorced when he was young. his mom had custody for a while; they moved around a lot. went to 3 different high schools, and 2 different middle schools, all private. freshman year hs was spent in a different country in a boarding school, in northern france an hour away from brussels, lille.  he grew up and befriended mostly white, upper class folks.

up until he came back from france, he was a clean person. he used to step on cigarettes on the floor and crack the tobacco out because he thought they were bad. when he returned to the us, he lived with his grandparents. he also played sports, basketball and football, rarely got sick, an otherwise healthy human with the clean slated potential to live to age 80. there wasn't any supervision because his gparents were old, he was very lonely, and most of his human contact was over the internet via AIM and multiplayer video games like counter strike and starcraft. he started smoking cigarettes during this time, so if anyone asks and has an issue with 420, the shit that's LEGAL and AVAILABLE are the real culprits, alcohol included.

not long after, he started smoking weed, age 15. hes been using weed since then, and it's never caused him any problems. his  memory seems to still be in tact and he never get sick, hes otherwise still healthy but he want to keep it that way because he will not  get any other chances after this.

he thinks this lonliness perpetuated through high school because of moving around a lot and having to ditch old friends and make new ones, but he also had a lot of other problems with himself like the way he looked and where he was from and things that he considers now to be, unimportant or, unrelated to a person's success. in other words, his brain didn't really start developing into an adult one until, about a year ago when he stopped using drugs. so his guess is that the drug use at the start of adolescence impeded his natural development. so all the above led to an interest of using drugs, he thinks stumbling on [erowid.com](https://erowid.com) browsing the internet probably reading up on things about weed, and then reading about the effects of all these drugs.

during high school from 16-18 he did ecstacy 3 times, mushrooms 5 times, lsd 3 times, and coke 10 times.

coke was the one that perpetuated the most. from 18-21 he did it a handful of times with a friend, maybe 3 times max, low doses as well under half gram. then when he was 21 in college, stumbled on poker, and got addicted to gambling. hes clean from gambling for 2 days. gambling produced a high greater than any of the drugs he had ever done, including high doses of cocaine, so from 21-25.50 he was completely clean from cocaine and all drugs. all he did was play poker online, losing, because in gambling the odds are against the player; how the game is designed. then from 26-30 the use went from once a month, to once a week, to 3 times a week, until January of 2020. He relapsed a handful of times throughout the year, incessantly trying to control the cravings.

cocaine and gambling cost him several jobs, his 20s, ten years of lifespan, and possibly more if he get disease later in life from it.  therefore, Tim would rather not be alive, than ever go back to these behaviors. they are no different to him, brain chemistry wise in memory and the hippocampus and everything, than causing lethal harm to yourself. from his experience, relapse is what prevents a person from ever being free. hes 100% sure hell never relapse on gambling or drugs. his brain has finally understood, schematically, that the above behaviors are fake, illusory, and unnatural. our brain chemistry is the result of millions of years of evolution; Tim doesn't want to ever fuck or tamper with it ever again, and has developed a DEEP respect for himself that never existed before in his life, which is what led him to these behaviors in the first place.

If you made it this far, my question is, based on the above history of use and drugs used, will Tim have a shot at physically restoring his brain chemistry to some modicum of normalcy? Having lost 10 years of his life to fake behaviors, can he still play video games. Do video games rank with these nasty things that exist, or is it a real form of dopamine release? Video games have never caused these kinds of problems. In tim's opinion, the worse they can do is take up a person's time.

Clean from smoking (cigarettes / dry weed): 1.1 years

Clean from cocaine: 1.1 months

Clean from gambling: 48 hours

Clean from all other drugs mentioned: 11 years

He uses a vaporizer pen to heat live resin oil now in the evenings, probably safer than a beer or glass of wine, and the primary reason was able to quit smoking.

My friend group and I always recreationally used drugs but I initially became reliant on benzos to curb my anxiety -- I have suffered with mental health issues like anxiety, depression and OCD - all diagnosed but I feel it is likely I also have PTSD - (I am on Prozac) since I was a preteen, age 11-12, due to my father being an alcoholic in my early life and then absent (he is now clean and in my life) and being molested when I was 12. 

Due to the benzos I was able to attend the top school I'd got into (Ivy) and maintain a life for myself, and then I was even able to confront the problem and attend outpatient treatment whilst hours away from my family and I am clean from benzos. However I begun to notice severe mood swings as Christmas drew nearer and when I went home to my family, what was meant to be a two week stay has turned into two months. I am bed ridden and my mood swings are uncontrollable and almost psychotic. I turned to cocaine and I am using daily in my bed alone. My parents are aware and do what they can to confiscate my drugs but they can't do it completely successfully. To add to the trauma I suffered a shock miscarriage - I was on birth control and took it perfectly as with my mental health history I am well versed in taking pills on schedule. I have since stopped taking it.

I cannot afford rehab, am terrified of losing the structure of school, and finally I am feeling guilt arise over my best friend's suicide. I feel like I am out of control of my coke use and I don't know if I'll make it to my psychiatric appointment I have booked later this month. I feel young and frightened and stupid and out of my depth. I am emaciated - I can barely eat, I can barely walk.

I have been reading books and everything I can find online regarding addiction and trying to ""rehabilitate"" myself but I find it is my impulsivity and boredom that is dangerous. I no longer enjoy using the coke and vow each time will be the last, however I seem to forget that I do not enjoy it and my boredom takes over completely - urges to self harm, urges to blow thousands of dollars (I am in debt, predictably). Bipolar disorder and substance abuse runs greatly in my family. I don't know how to stop doing coke. All I want in my life now is to settle down, get my degree, get a job, have a baby with my boyfriend who is doing everything he can and is desperately worried. I want to stop but I am compulsively doing it. Please help me",8

2021-02-04 00:35:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lc8o2i/why_ive_done_drugs_for_25_years/,Why I've done drugs for 25 years...,"I have been using drugs since I was 18 years old.  I'm 45 now and don't think I was ever sober except for two days in my 20's.  I started with ecstasy, weed, and my favorite GHB.  I would occasionally do coke and meth, tried LSD and Shrooms, but hated psychedelics.  

I was addicted to GHB for 6 years everyday.  Than the US had to ban some chemicals for GHB so I became an alcoholic for two years than stopped bc I started playing poker and played better when sober.  

Than I had surgery on my elbow and started taking pain medication.  It started with the blue Vicodin's (don't remember the name) than found a shady Dr who prescribed me Norcos.  I was addicted to Norco's for 3 years.  I've had the most success in life using Norco's and adderalls.  This was the start of my part time professional poker career (I had a good computer gig FT).  I took adderalls and Norcos and made over $900k in online poker in 5-6 years and my biggest win was a $140k in one poker tournament.  I got to play at the WSOP with all expenses paid and a suite for 1 week, play in the main event at the WPT, go to the Bahamas and Florianopolis, Brazil and other places to play poker.  Than George fucking Bush banned online poker in the U.S.  To this day it was called Black Friday.  

Afterwards my life started going downhill.  I had problems looking for a job, but got lucky finding one.  When everything went to shits was when I started shooting Heroin and smoking meth everyday with my ex GF.  I got arrested for the first time at 40, did county time, got released on a suspended sentence, kept getting caught with dirty UA's and went to prison and sentenced to 8 years for conspiracy.  Got released early after doing a year and a half and now I'm on ab109 and I don't know how long probation will be.  I found a job sober for the first time in my life and it's one of the worst paying jobs I've ever had.  At least I get tips and with a felony record I'm blessed I have a job.  

Doing drugs for 25 years straight has made me a different, but a better person in a way.  I would never have won all that money, never would have gone through all these life experiences, and never would have met the people I've met throughout my life.  At 18 I raved for 12 years going one-three times monthly and having the time of my life.  I've been with the most beautiful women in the world, models, pornstars, and drop dead gorgeous women.  The one regret I have is the girl that snitched on me and started my downfall.  I lost my career, got a felony record, lost my place, lost my investments, savings, and a big part of me.  I can't do drugs or I'll go back to jail.  I find this ridiculous bc I perform well high.  Drugs have given me confidence, help me learn and work hard and this has all been taken away.  Not every person is the same.  Some people can't handle drugs and some like myself perform at the highest level.  Are better people and stay out of trouble high.  

When I got out of jail and even now with a job, being sober is boring.  Boredom leads to loneliness, and loneliness leads to depression and depression can lead to suicide.  When I've been high, I've always been content.  Never bored or felt lonely and always content.  Probation is a joke. I did my time, I want to be free again and live.  I do not need someone watching over me and making sure I don't fuck up.  I'll fuck up bc of the pressure they put on me. Not everyone is the same.  They don't understand this.",29

Don‚Äôt know what I deserve for the attention but its been one of the small things getting me through this FUCKING withdrawal. 

Today‚Äôs been FUCKING horrid. I have been in writhing pain all day, I described it to my therapist as a beam of light that just needs to burst through my chest but is also infecting the rest of my body. Its been abysmal and I also slept through a doctors appointment where I could maybe have gotten some soboxone or something to deal with this shit but maybe its a sign. 

The voices in my head are back. I don‚Äôt suffer from schizophrenia or anything, but after doing hardcore drugs for this whole month and drinking for a year prior, its weird to actually think again. Having that constant voice saying shit, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna deal with it because that fucker is what got me into this in the first place. But its also the voice that sbows me how beautiful the world is. I live in such a beautiful neighborhood in America and I was just looking down my street seeing all the gas street lamps and thinking wow, what a beautiful sight.

I‚Äôve spent the whole day watching Euphoria, a show where I‚Äôve heavily identified with the main character. She‚Äôs a drug addict who is in a somewhat similar situation to me. I just graduated from college, with a honored degree in psychology. I still live in a world of parties, drug use, casual sex and intense socialization. This is one of the biggest fears of mine, since I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm gonna go to a social function again without using something to make it a lil easier. Not something to worry about now through, gotta focus on my sobriety and just existing before I can think about going to some party.

I was talking with my therapist about my life today and just thinking about why I despise myself so much. I don‚Äôt know where it comes from, because I know that I‚Äôm naturally a super caring and sweet human being. Maybe I‚Äôve been faking it all these years just to gain approval and I want to know it deep down that I am good without doing it for others. 

I also talked about my absolute obsession with women and dating in general. This whole abuse cycle of 2020-2021 started with me breaking up with my ex. We had dated for 2.5 years as I may have talked about in my previous post but I can‚Äôt be asked to check. I have been searching for love for so long on dating apps for the past few months, and its legit one of the most important things to me. I don‚Äôt know why but all I fucking want in the world is to be held and told ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù probably that validation I seek since I don‚Äôt believe myself if I ever told me that.

Well I‚Äôm fuckin dead and don‚Äôt wanna think anymore tonight. I went to NA tonight for the second night in a row, and I‚Äôm proud of that. Wish me luck tomorrow since I think I may have to go to work but I may cancel if im fucking dying but I kinda hope I feel better so I can make some money.",2

2021-02-03 22:01:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/lc5uzq/115_hours_into_sobriety/,115 hours into sobriety,"For those of you that don‚Äôt want to do the math I am 5 hours shy of my 5th day not smoking any weed. If I would have slept 8 hours a night, that is 75 hours I have been awake, however iv only been sleeping roughly 4 hours every night so that adds up to about 90 hours iv been awake the last 5 days. Not an hour has gone by I don‚Äôt think about my old beloved drug, but my power of will has grow significantly. I will now get to the reason of my post. 

Today was probably the worst day of my life at least the worst day I can remember. It start off half way into my 8 hour shift at fire house subs. See, Iv had lower back issues the past two year and after a few doctor appointments, chiropractic adjustment, and even physical therapy nothing had helped me. I made a decision to go back to the doctor and push for x-rays. Well, I got my x-rays back and hearing the results on the phone(during my 30 min break)They told me something along the lines of.. I have a degenerative back disorder called  retrolisthesis that involved my s1 and s5 disk. I had no idea what any of this meant. Shortly after a few google searches I found my answer. It‚Äôs basically an injury that is un cure-able and mostly people are prescribed muscles relaxers, and injection of steroids in the lower back and in cases that neither of those help, surgery. I‚Äôve lived every day the last 2 years in pain. The best way to describe it is I feel a sharp pain about 3- 4 hours a day that feels like a knife is being inserted into my lower back on my right side, the time the pain is manageable it feel more like a dull pain that is just annoying. I feel back pain every step I take, every time I stand longer then 5 min, any time I sit in a chair over 30 min (including driving), whenever I bend over or squat, even at times while laying down. Sitting in my car reading that I will live the rest of my life with lower back pain that even surgery and drugs won‚Äôt be able to take care of, I cried. (Btw I‚Äôm 21 years old the age of invincibility some say) But I had to get back to work and put my best smile on.( and I did )
I think in my brain iv know for a long time my back was never going to get better, but having the facts in front of my face was like being slapped in the face with ice water and metal hand. It hurt and I was shocked, sad and angry, plus not smoking weed made emotions pour out of me in 10 fold. Work wasn‚Äôt horrible neither was my day. But the realization of my back was enough to wipe every happy thought from my brain and make my day a living hell. 
I‚Äôm a great actor, could probably play in movie I‚Äôd say. None of my coworkers asked me what was wrong and I had cheery voice every time I talked to a customer. But behind that face showed the shadow of so many bad thoughts in my head.  Well the orthopedic doctor will call me next week for my first visit and hopefully what they do can help some of my pain. A lot of the time I smoked weed to forget about the pain but now I may be prescribe pain killers which I will not take under any circumstance. I have far to addicted of a personality to start talking those kind of pills. I will not smoke weed agin for the rest of my life I don‚Äôt care if it helps my pain, I feel like unemotional zombie that cares about little to nothing besides my own pleasure. I know that sounds sick but that is the person I am being addicted to weed. In these last 5 days iv experienced more emotion then iv felt in what feels like months( not good emotions) but emotions all the same and I missed them like I miss my half sister I haven‚Äôt seen in close to 8 years. I know I‚Äôm metamorphosing into the happy fun loving polite person I was before I smoked weed, and I won‚Äôt quit, it just hurts to know it will never be gone. 
I‚Äôm sorry this post is so long and sorry some of it is a little off topic for the group all the same if you had made it to the end of this please share your thoughts I would love it and it helps me stay sober. 
So much love I can‚Äôt even put in words for you beautiful people.

I started taking them occasionally for pain and then they helped me sleep so I took them for that, then I realised how relaxed they made me feel and I continued taking them for that. Cut to now I‚Äôve somehow gotten into the habit of taking them every day and I take more to cope with intense emotions instead of working through them, I find myself craving that feeling. The only thing stopping me from going onto considerably stronger opiates is that I know for a fact I would spiral quickly and ruin my life, it is however tempting and the thought is often in my mind. ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt let it spiral, just take a few and then stop‚Äù, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt let it become a problem you have too much to loose‚Äù.

Moral of the story is even if you think it would never happen to you (I‚Äôve had it easy, have a good life, good job, amazing family and upbringing) it absolutely can grab you and I can see how easy it is to fall down that rabbit hole.

My 17 yo sister is addicted to meth. My dad has seen some therapist that told him the worst thing we can do is to force her into a rehab center, that we as a family need to show her love and be patient because she needs to be the one that decides to get help and the core problem isn't drugs but her traumas and emotional problems (she and I didn't have a nice childhood). I keep reading meth destroys your life and the life of your loved ones, but I don't think my sister will do anything about it, she doesn't wants to do therapy and basically just wants to end her life and get high in the meantime. I want her to be alive and healthy and happy, but I don't know how. It's hard to know she might die because of meth. I read that in this situations you should run away because the addiction is basically hell for the family and being around is like approving her behavior. I don't want to see how my sister wastes her life in that shit, but I don't want to abandon her either. There are people that recovered from addiction, is there really nothing I can do to help my sister become one them? We know she's been into meth for around 10 months.

What's addiction? What does it mean in terms of self-harm?

I was addicted. I use to require it to function, to escape, to cope. I had to, wanted to, needed to self-harm but it's not like that anymore. I use to crave it.

It's not like that anymore. Or that's what I keep telling myself.

But now twice in the past 8 months I've turned back. It was minimal both times, just a taste, I guess you could say. Just a small craving. 

The feeling creeping back that for some reason unknown to me at the moment, that I *needed* to. I could resist and resist and resist until at one point, I *couldn't*.

Does that mean I'm addicted? My day to day isn't overwhelmed by the desire to self-harm. My mind isn't drowning with thoughts of requirement. 


It's just sometimes, I have a temptation that I just *can't* resist.

I suppose if I slip into a continuous pattern like I have before then I would consider myself to be addicted *again* but am I already addicted now?",4

Looking to curb the last crutch.,"Im looking for something to temporarily help ease cannabis withdrawal *without* forming a new dependency. I read a couple of different studies where Memantine showed potential in treating bipolar as well as withdrawal from stronger substances like heroin and opiates, so I‚Äôm curious to know if anybody has experience to share with using it as a sort of ‚Äúbridge‚Äù to getting sober, who may also have bipolar disorder.

I've been a daily smoker for the past several years. I don‚Äôt enjoy smoking any more as it has a lot more negative consequences now like anxiety and paranoia for me, but at this point i smoke 1-2 times daily to avoid the multi week span of mood swings, loss of hunger, can‚Äôt sleep, irritability and potentially a reoccurrence in psychosis I have experienced several times trying to quit. I have used cannabis to initially medicate PTSD and Bipolar (BP1), but I have used cannabis & CBD relentlessly over the years to help me quit many other addictions I picked up like: cigarettes, alcohol and a long period where I was stacking opiates and benzos daily.

Needless to say, under all the drug abuse there is something deeply logged within that keeps me in a cycle of addiction. I need to heal and transform and I am not interested in escaping that reality any longer. I‚Äôve quit everything besides cannabis thus far and I‚Äôm nearing my two year mark of being off of psych medications. I use a lot of breath work, meditation, running and periodic sessions of micro-dosing psilocybin to work through this shit, and I need to keep it up. But damn, cannabis withdrawal does not help me keep to this routine and neither does cannabis use. I have a good feeling about trying memantine to help temporarily, but I also can‚Äôt find any reports of success or failure with info relative to my interest for use specifically.

Anybody have experience with something similar? All input welcome and appreciated.",1

(cocaine, molly, painkillers, etc). i was stealing the little money my parents had to get all this stuff and did not give a single shit. i didn't care if i was destroying my body or not, i didn't even care if i died or not. eventually i was caught overdosing (on purpose, i was trying to commit suicide), was temporarily kicked out of school, and put in rehab. now im 366 days sober, and im proud to be in the place that i am. i understand that i am an addict, i understand that i won't be able to live a ""normal"" teenage life. but, quarantine has been really hard for me. everyday i wake up and just get more and more depressed. i feel like an eventual relapse is coming faster and faster, and i don't know how to stop it. it's been especially hard because i haven't been going to AA or NA meetings. i wanted to get my 1 year coin but can't because we don't have any meetings currently running in my neighborhood.

not only that but all these annoying ass kids in my grade are going around social media claiming that they are ""druggies,"" bragging about all the hard shit that they've done and how they're gonna die of an overdose. i don't know what exactly it is but something just makes me want to reach through the screen and slap these fuckass kids. ive struggled with addiction my entire childhood, and will struggle with it for the rest of my life. these kids act like they're these hard addicts and make it into some cool personality trait. to give you some perspective, these are like your average ""i don't give a fuck about school"" skater kids who pop xans all the time and act like they rule the world. it is so hard to be sober and see shit like this. these mfs act like they're hard as hell and are gangsters/drug kingpins, when in reality we live in a white suburb, and most of these kids have parents that make 250k+ a year.  part of me just wants to clock these kids in the face and tell them that they're living in a fairytale dream. it's so frustrating. i hate teenagers. i hate quarantine.

Troops returning from Vietnam went cold turkey (suffered withdrawals, etc) and didn't crave more of the drug. If you give a lonely rat the choice between cocaine and water, it chooses cocaine, and it gets hooked. But if you give it a better environment, with other rats to socialise with, then it will choose to go back to the water and go through the withdrawals willingly. I read that in the book 'Biology of desire' .  Neuro-plasticity means that neural pathways change over time. People lose half there skull and brain in accidents, and parts of the brain, that were designated for other functions will recolonise and create new pathways to compensate for the jobs of the parts that were lost. Our brains are environment-dependant and will adapt. Massive changes are possible in our neural-pathways or neural-highways in some cases lol. 

Just my thoughts/ rant.

‚ÄúIt isn't the drug that causes the harmful behavior - it's the environment. An isolated rat will almost always become a junkie. A rat with a good life almost never will, no matter how many drugs you make available to him. As Bruce put it: he was realizing that addiction isn't a disease. Addiction is an adaptation. It's not you - it's the cage you live in.‚Äù ( Johann Hari (* 1979) British columnist, journalist, writer, Chasing the Scream.

 I'm a Ludomaniac.  I am 20 years old, I live in Kazakhstan.
 As an ordinary guy, I was interested in football, I had a favorite football team.  And at the age of 16 I will see my friends place bets in bookmakers.  Then I decided to try with them.  Save money on dinners in the canteen, put the money that my relatives gave me.  Everything was no offense.  But I got a taste.  I was constantly losing my pocket money at bets.  But then I had no problems, then I forgot about the rates.  When I was 18 I entered the capital of my country.  I wanted to go to a big city.  I had plans for the future, I wanted to become a programmer.  I had a great love for IT.  I could not enroll in a programmer, but I entered another profession to the brink (Completely free training).  I had a girlfriend who loved me very much, big ambitions for the future (I myself began to learn web programming).  Started working at Burger King.  But soon when the money appeared, I remembered about the rates.  I thought to save money, and live on the money earned on the rates.
 I lost every salary (It was not a big $) in the first days at the rates.
 I had constant money problems.  I hid everything from my girlfriend.  I started to take things to a pawnshop (laptop, phone). I took out a micro loan for $ 30, which then grew to $ 120.  Sometimes I won, but I didn't have this money for long.  I rarely went out with my girlfriend for a walk, because I hid that I had no money.  She thought I had lost touch with her.  Soon because of this, we parted.  I still think I'm a fool.  She loved, took care of me.  And I lost it for this problem.  The quarantine began, and I left for my hometown to my parents.  I have the most wonderful parents in the world and have always tried to be the best son.  They also did not know about the rates.  I started to work in the same way, but still I didn't play a lot.
 I have not paid the loan yet, so I renewed it every time (According to the conditions, I must pay the entire amount, or renew the term).  Parents asked where the things that I handed over to the pawnshop.  I lied that I left my friend in the capital.  I didn't have the money to buy the same laptop, so I started betting and losing again.  Now I am 20 years old, I told my parents that I would take my old laptop from a friend and come and look for a job as a programmer in the capital.  I am afraid to admit my mistake to my parents.  Now I am in the capital, pretending to be busy.  Now I understand where my life is going.  I'm scared.  All I want to end up with is this.  I hope I can find the money, buy a laptop, and be done with this for good.  If not for that.  Perhaps I would be with my girlfriend, get a job as a programmer and everything would be fine.  Maybe if I can finish it all this will work out.  But I have bad thoughts about how to get this money to finish with the bets. I am very afraid to upset my mother.  I even thought about the crime.  Fortunately, I immediately give up these thoughts.  Please don't ever repeat my mistakes.  If everything works out for me, I will definitely write about it.",3

I‚Äôm terrified.,"I‚Äôm sitting here writing this because I have no one else to talk to and I‚Äôm going through the emotional turmoil of Opiate withdrawl. Ive been on around 120mg of percoset per day for a little less than a month and drinking half a bottle to a bottle of whiskey a day for a few months before that. I‚Äôm so depressed and saddened by who I have become and I don‚Äôt know the real me anymore. I‚Äôm scared to take this journey again because I know that dealing with how truly miserable I am in my own skin is going to be an abysmal journey. 

I‚Äôve been an addict all my life, but I remember drinking the champagne/wine from peoples glasses when people weren‚Äôt looking at dinner parties and events; I was 8 at the time. I started drinking and smoking in 7th and 8th grade respectively and ever since then I‚Äôve done anything I can get my hands on. I went to rehab for prescription pill and weed addiction when I was in my early 20s and managed some semblance of sobriety until 2020.

In December of 2019, my long term girlfriend and I decided to split up amicably. We didn‚Äôt have anything in common overall and the relationship had soured but I definitely see now that she was the rock that held my sobriety together, instead of having me hold it together for myself. She didn‚Äôt use drugs or drink so it was easy to be around her and helped me cope with my addiction. After we broke up I went off the deep end and dived straight back into the world of addiction. Its obvious now that I was never really sober, I just was codependent. Now that I am alone, I have been chasing love ever since in some sick fantasy it will make me feel better about how much I truly despise living in my body.

The reason I used, personally, is to escape my horrifying anxiety and mental illness that has plagued me since I was 4 years old and I couldn‚Äôt sleep in my own bedroom because I was terrified of burglars. I have never felt safe around other people and I am constantly viewing myself from the third person when I am sober. Its so tiring and I just hate socializing without a drink or two and it gets actually fun when I get fucked up. This is what I worry about, what if I‚Äôm just meant to be this way. I don‚Äôt want to be this way and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd ever truly accept myself as this person. I just wish I was fucking different. I wish I didn‚Äôt feel every fucking emotion so intensely to the point of insanity. I wish I had the ability not to so adamantly care about peoples acceptance of me. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore so I‚Äôve started going back to NA today.

I don‚Äôt have 24 hours sober yet. Im still tapering off Percocet and I had a small glass of wine to deal with this horrible depression. Probably not the best thing to do but Its just so god damn hard right now. I feel so UTTERLY alone and miserable. I just wish I had someone here to hug me and tell me its all going to be okay. I am terrified for whats to come, I really am, but I know I will kill myself soon if I don‚Äôt get a handle on this. I‚Äôm at a breaking point and I don‚Äôt want to spend another year fucked up beyond belief. I love you all so fucking much, and thank you for giving me the courage to have some semblance of belief I can be happy. Thank you for sharing your stories and keeping miserable drugged up bastards like me aware of what we are doing and giving us something to look up to.

My peace was stolen, there was no stability being a slave to the obsession. At the time i was leaning on temporary comforts, but after i shifted my focus on finding peace within myself and not from outside sources I've been able to start recovering. The strength i can now draw on is organic and is always within me.

How can I support them without shaming them?**

&#x200B;

Someone who I care for very deeply seems like they might be struggling pretty seriously with addiction. For context, they are someone I dated in the past in the past and kept in touch with over the years after. We recently started up our relationship again, however they had to move away for a few months because of the pandemic. We are in our early 20's. 

Anyways, we talk pretty frequently, and lately they have been telling me they are drinking and using drugs everyday (I think mdma or speed but idk, I know they don't smoke weed) and it seems like its effecting their life a lot.  I know they have a history of addiction in their family. I know this isn't new, and seems like something that's been going on for over a year, but I haven't been consistent enough in their life to really tell until now. 

Today they sent me a message saying they've been getting drunk and high multiple times a day and avoiding their homework. Before the pandemic they were one of the hardest working people I've ever met, and are very successful in school and the art world. 

I don't really know how to interact with them around this because of my position to them and my personal history.  I was very anti drug growing and would stigmatize and shame people, but I've learned a lot since then about harm reduction and drug positivity, and even use them recreational once or twice a year. I don't want to shame this person and I want them to be able to trust me and confide in me. I used to shame my mom from smoking cigarettes' and to this day she still try's to hide it from me even when I say I don't care.  I really don't want to repeat that with this person. I don't judge them or think less of them at all and I don't want to make them feel shameful. At the same time I just don't really know what to say because often when they send messages it feels like a cry for help. It's happened a few times where they reach out when they're using and just randomly tell me about frequency and say they are spiraling and have been drunk every day for a week. 

Anyways, I really love this person, like even outside our romantic relationship I really really care about them and am worried. I still am unsure if its my place to step in and say ""this is a problem"" if they don't see it that way. They have lots of people around them who really love them, but I don't know if those people see it as a problem. It hasn't really effected our relationship at all, partially because we are living 10 hours apart, so I don't want to jump in and say ""you have an addiction. I'm also pretty worried about pushing them away. 

I guess what I am really asking is how should I respond when they tell me about these things? How can I be a supportive friend or lover?

I've been dating a man whom is a relapsed alcoholic.
He was upfront with me about his issues past when we started dating, but the last ~2 months he hit a major backslide due to personal issues. 
The difference in him is quite shocking to me. It breaks my heart because I truly care about him. I also lost my mother to alcoholism.
We're not so deeply connected that I couldn't just walk away. But I can't bring myself to do it at this point. And I'm well aware that a change is not something I can force on him, though I do encourage any comments he makes about quitting alcohol, and offer to help anyway I can (I.E. working out together, etc.).
My question is, how should I tread in the meantime? He's not very vocal about his feelings like I am, and I certainly don't want to make him feel worse than he may already.

It gives me unrest
Constant boredom I receive
And nothing I get 
I long for a moment
When I escape this pattern 
Of rising and falling
Of going and leaving

I met new people
I have new friends
This mundane I have had 
is coming to an end
I see the light at the end 
I see the boredom fade
The tools I love
Yet my thoughts are telling me to stay

Time has passed 
I feel more alive 
Everyday is spontaneous 
Nothing is a pattern
There are tools you can use to alter your mind
It makes me even more alive
But I am often guilty
I seem to miss the mundane
I don't know why 
I hated that place

Friends are not Friends
Tools are Knives
Why did I leave the Mundane 
I can‚Äôt explain why 
I wanted an out 
Now I want in

Yet again time has passed 
The mundane is not mundane 
It is light and freedom 
It is everything I ever wanted
Why didn‚Äôt I just stay there
Even though I am back
I have forever left a mark 
As someone who has seen the abyss

The Mundane is life 
The Mundane is takes strength
The Mundane is Constant 
The Mundane is Fluid
The abyss lies 
The abyss intrigues
The Mundane has never hurt you

I recently hit rock bottom and nearly destroyed my marriage. I am currently working with a therapist (been about a month) which is helping but feel like I would benefit from an in-patient rehab facility.

Searching for services/program to help me is proving difficult. There aren't many options and what I found are overwhelmingly oriented for men and not women. I found 2 programs - one was in Arizona and cost $60k for 45 days!

Im based in PNW but willing to travel for a program if needed.

Im gonna try to keep this short. 

Long story short. I was prescribed 10 mg ir adderalls in the 11th grade when i was 17 years old. 

Im 21 years old now and I‚Äôm quite addicted. 

I abused the fuck out of them. 

My doctor cut me off in my 1st semester of college and since then I havent given it up. I would keep buying them. Non stop. And that made it worse. 

I would smoke weed every night and come back up every morning with adderall. 

I am a real estate broker. I know its who I am meant to be. But the adderall fucks me up. I am on speed every second and I am disconnected. I feel very socially off. 

I know its in me to be a negotiator and a communicator but adderall took my voice away a long time ago. 
Ive ruined relationships and gotten very angry at times.  And right now i dont know what to do. 

When i am on it
I get hand shakes. 
I make these faces i cant control. 
I always feel cracked out. 
Any time i stop, it only lasts a week because i just feel so scared to go to work without it. 
Any time i would go to work off adderall i would hide in a room where nobody could find me

But when i am on adderall im also just counterproductive 

Its time to stop

But it kind of feels like ive ruined myself. 

My jaw feels tight and it clicks if i want it too

Its really hard to communicate
 
I have this puzzled look on my face all day. 

Please , Honestly, am i fucked up forever?

In the past 20+ years I have been fucked up every single day with the exception of 30 days I was in rehab 10 years ago. For the first 5 years I only dabbled in various drugs, but the past 15 I quickly went from Oxy's to Fent and then the past year H. Every day is still a struggle, but with my first child on the way and crippling depression over wasting such a large portion of the most important years of my life I knew I needed to change or cash my chips in.

I am just posting this so everyone knows no matter how long you have been addicted or how far gone you feel you can try to take a different path.

\- Obv this isn't my normal account, as I hid my addition pretty successfully from all my friends and family, and only my wife and parents know most of what I just said.",20

I am seeking advice about my older brother and what is wrong with him. I think it may be hard drugs but I don‚Äôt know for sure. He was always such a charismatic and confident boy who grew up with aspirations of being a professional hockey player. He was attractive, popular and loved by many. When he didn‚Äôt make it, he fell into the party scene where I know he dabbled with party drugs and went to music festivals. He was using mdma and cocaine frequently. He may have been abusing cocaine as he works in the food service industry and that is rampant there. However, when he was about 22 I noticed things change for the worse. The main thing that struck me was his eyes. Usually so bright, blue and full of life, they had become dark, grey and soulless. Recently, his teeth have become dark and rotten, making me think he‚Äôs on something worse. I only visit home periodically due to school and every time he seemed to be worse and worse. I noticed he became highly agitated and almost paranoid with his shifty eyes. He can never sit still. The only time he seems relaxed is when he is drinking. And I know he‚Äôs struggled with drinking. At its worst, he could consume a 2‚Äô6 of vodka and seem fine to an onlooker. He also smokes weed. I don‚Äôt think either of these are the main issue. His personality slowly changed, once friendly and full of life to now dark and twisted. He seems to be in so much pain. He is extremely volatile, snapping at anyone who tries to offer help or support. He‚Äôs cut ties and said horrible things to every member of our family, usually unprovoked. His reaction to something mundane is bizarre. He‚Äôs quit drinking now for almost a year, but his behaviour is almost worse. He is so angry at everyone and everything. We just don‚Äôt know what to do. One of the last times I saw him was around Thanksgiving and he was euphoric, talking about the secret to life and how he‚Äôs on a ‚Äúfrequency higher than most people and understands things on a different level‚Äù. He gets into these moods which don‚Äôt seem to last. He was so weird he wouldn‚Äôt let anyone else talk, he was just ranting and in his own world moving around the room very animated. This made me believe he was on some sort of stimulants. Then I saw him again a few months ago and that‚Äôs when he snapped saying he didn‚Äôt want to speak to any of us again, that he hates us and that we‚Äôre all fake. We‚Äôve never done anything to receive this kind of treatment. He goes through periods where he‚Äôs insanely healthy and gets super fit then 6 months later he‚Äôs drinking 2L pops and eating all day and night. I‚Äôve thought maybe he is bipolar... but he‚Äôs never seen a professional, despite pleas from numerous people. I just want him to see a psychologist. But he won‚Äôt. We are all so worried about him and just want the old him back but I don‚Äôt know if he even exists anymore. It‚Äôs so heartbreaking... Please any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.",2

I was high when I wrote it, and i didn't even remember writing it until I found it between my phone and case this morning. I have been clean for 5 days and even though it has been tough, finding this note gave me new inspiration.

""Let this be my rock bottom.
Defeated.
Tired.
Alone.
There is only up from here.
It will be hard, dragging all this baggage up the hill.
But the view gets better the higher you go & the baggage gets left behind.
Rise and find you place, your people.
They are there, waiting for your light.""

I hope this can help anyone struggling with addiction. Stay strong my friends, there is hope.",22

Today, things got a bit worse when he admitted himself to the hospital with shortness of breath and it was found that his lung had collapsed.

And the only thing I've been thinking since is that he probably still won't stop taking this stuff 'just' because of that. 

I'm so worried and angry and I want to shake him until he choses life because despite 10 years of preparing for it I am not willing or ready to lose my little brother! 

But I can't even go to him, as they don't allow any visitors in emergency. So I'm just crying on my couch, uselessly. 

I really just needed to put it into words, before my head explodes. Thanks for 'listening' üíó",2

So far its been going good and i feel i'm finally getting my life under control. Not experiencing so much of a withdrawal rn, and i do notice a significant increase in my academic productivity. However ever since i quit these addictions, i've been feeling increasingly bored. Other than studying, i have nothing else to do all day. I dont have anything to destress or decompress with. I do have hobbies such as producing music time to time, but rn im completely demotivated to do any of that. I feel other than school and eating, all i do is aimlessly scroll through reddit and discord all day. Its like as if i'm watching paint dry. I dont have a life, i need something to make my life more meaningful, to fill the void which i previously occupied with youtube and porn and videogames, but i currently dont. Any suggestions as to how i can help myself?",1

Addicted to cocaine for over 12 months.  Started socially,  then started doing it at home on my own (if I had some left over I obviously didn't want my high to end). Lockdown kicked in. Became dependent on it. Helped me through days of nothing, not knowing and just general shit. Parents found out, got help but September to December last year I couldn't go more than 8 days without it. Fell into a hole between Christmas and New year. Never thought I'd be a person who couldn't leave my house out of fear. Started 2021 good. Clean. 17 days. Longest time since last Jan. However I had holidays to use up so currently in the middle of 12 days off work and well,  relapsed.  Over and over. Got paid on 25th. I now have ¬£7 to my name. Not sure why I've done relapsed. Boredom, habit, my mind is completely gone. Not sure where to go from here.
The high from the current stuff I'm getting is unreal, the emotional damage I am doing is damaging. A circle. I am just frustrated with myself. My parents paid off nearly 10k for me and I pay them every month, but I just can't stop. I am scared. I don't know how to cope or go on. I'm afraid of how I will cope with situations in the future. I'm afraid of how people will react if I tell them my situation. Covid has been hard enough on all of us,  admitting I am addicted to cocaine is one of the biggest struggles of my life.  I just can't address it.",12

I have so many drugs at my disposal. I used to use just a couple times a week to help my anxiety around social situations. It was fine for awhile but now when I‚Äôm sober I‚Äôm depressed and anxious. Also having depersonalization. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore I feel worthless. 

Even when I‚Äôm on drugs I can‚Äôt feel good about myself anymore. I don‚Äôt know what drug my body is needing that makes me feel so bad. 

It‚Äôs such a complicated situation. Poly drug abuse isn‚Äôt really studied much and I thought by using different drugs I wouldn‚Äôt get addicted to one. Or it‚Äôs just that so many bad things have been happening in my life and my depression is so strong that drugs don‚Äôt help anymore. 

I know I need to just quit it all but I wont be able to go out with friends and do things that are enjoyable for a long time which will make me more sad. 

I‚Äôve quit weed and nicotine which I was using everyday and I guess it helped with the anxiety but the depersonalization is still real. 

I can‚Äôt even enjoy normal things even on drugs. 
I‚Äôm just looking to see if anyone has had a similar situation and can share their experience. I can‚Äôt really talk to anyone without them treating me like an addict.

Edit. Idk Id I should just stick to the same drug everyday so that at least my brain isn‚Äôt confused with so many different drugs. Maybe that will work then try to quit that drug slowly.",4
