She now blames me for further wrecking her life with the whole court issue and because she says I'm taking away her most important thing.

Anyways... sharing your biggest fuck ups in life can be cathartic and I recommend it.,"There is a big stigma with meth addiction.  People often think it’s trailer park trash and scum of the earth type addicts that fall in with this shit.  Being able to vent and share my story online anonymously has shown me that there are people all over the world fighting the same fight.  It’s also given me something that I have become passionate about that would be considered a healthy project (my blog.)

For my fellow addict brothers and sisters I can’t recommend how important it is to find something that interests you to cling on to in recovery.  I honestly don’t know where I would be or what my recovery process would look like if I hadn’t decided to just start typing out my feelings one random sad day. 

It’s not the answer to addiction, but it’s helping me get through the day.  If you are going strong in your recovery, don’t just lurk on these forums, get engaged and participate and share whatever the fuck it is that you are doing that is working for you.  There simply aren’t enough addicts sharing their stories online and I think a reason for that is that most people that are strong in their recovery process are sponsoring someone or giving back more in person than digitally.

If there are other recovering meth addicts, I can guarantee you that if you shared your story online in a blog recovery format like I have you would have addicts and people from all over the world reaching out to you for help.  It’s sorely needed in this world.  If anyone wants help on starting up a recovery blog there is a ton of support over at r/blogging and I am also happy to help.  Don’t let lack of technical expertise stop you from spreading your story online.

Here’s the interview.  I stuttered and stumbled through a lot of it, but that’s not the point as much as just vomiting up your mental baggage.

However, I will try my best. 

My fiancé is a fairly heavy drinker and grew up in a family that was. I don’t drink (partially due to interaction with alcohol and prescriptions I take) and grew up in a family that barely drank. In the time we’ve been together, he’s acknowledged that the way he drinks isn’t sustainable long term but feels that it’s acceptable until we have kids (not in the immediate future but in the next 3-5 years probably), at which point we have agreed that we don’t want our kids to be around drinking unless it’s a special occasion. I’ve told him it’s going to be way easier to do it gradually than all at once because I will absolutely not tolerate my children being around that. It’s still a ways off but I think it’s an important conversation have and agree upon. 

He drinks most nights when he is done with work and everything else; not getting drunk but probably tipsy and it’s absolutely a coping mechanism (he agrees with this too). Without giving too much information, he has some pretty significant family issues (think drug addiction, mental health, suicide attempts, etc. with close family members) and this year has been particularly bad, as well as has come with a lot of unexpected job transition and stress. 

He had agreed a few months ago that he would stop drinking on weekdays. He stopped for a few weeks but then started again when an unexpected and stressful life event occurred. He says he still plans on stopping but he doesn’t know how to manage his stress otherwise for right now. He agrees it’s unhealthy but feels like once these stressors are gone he can. Although I empathize with the stress he is going through, I also feel like there are always going to be life stressors to some extent. He also smokes and although he has SIGNIFICANTLY cut back, he still does minimally despite telling me he would stop completely. He uses the same excuse about it being such a stressful year that the additional stress of completely stopping smoking is too much right now but he still ultimately wants to. Hearing this about two different vices is probably why I’ve started to have some doubt creep up. 

I am starting to worry that this is going to be a continuing pattern - him stopping, then something happening, and him saying it’s too stressful of a time to do it. I’ve brought it up a lot recently and we got into a big fight about it. If he didn’t have these extreme family and work stressors, I would have put my foot down completely. However, he keeps saying how he doesn’t get why I don’t trust him because he’s given me no reason not to otherwise in our relationship and I keep going between feeling like this is manipulation or if he actually does have a point. 

At the end of the day, we genuinely do have a really happy relationship and are both successful in our respective job fields. I’ve never really felt like it affects our relationship or his work but I also don’t want to find myself ten years later, with kids, this still being a thing, and feel like I ignored it. 

I would REALLY appreciate any insight you may have. I am fully invested in our relationship but need help figuring out how much justification I have for feeling this way. Please feel free to ask for any clarifying information if you need it to give your thoughts more accurately. Thank you.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8696244359016418}"

Hi everyone,

I   hope everything is well :) I am a Psychology student at University. I came to study psychology because I had my own challenges with addiction in my 20s, and thanks to the help of psychologists and many others, I  found this beautiful thing called recovery.  I was surprised during my time at uni about how little mention was done in relation to substance misuse, apart from my supervisor! I want to get the conversation going at uni and promote recovery from alcohol problems.  For this reason, I  decided to carry out my research project, which explores the wellbeing of people in recovery.

I  need your help: I am looking for stories of recovery from alcohol dependency for my study. If you live in the UK and have been in recovery for at least 6  months, I kindly ~~beg~~ invite you to take part. You can do it online, it should take less than 15 minutes, and you could win a £50 Amazon UK voucher!

Thanks, guys for your time, and I look forward to putting all your stories together :)

I'm currently at university doing an undergrad course, and I'm enjoying it!

I relapsed. HARD. Monday night, after 5 whole months without touching anything. My body has made it *very* clear that it is (understandably) pissed off with my decision, and whilst I have no desire to do it again and I'm going to continue working on being clean, it's made work almost impossible this week. I spent Tuesday in bed feeling like I was genuinely dying. Wednesday and today I'm just so physically and mentally exhausted that I know I'm going to struggle to do well on these deadlines. I can't get an extension and I'm kinda panicking - I don't want my Monday night fuck-up to screw my grades for the whole year just because of the % weight of this work.

The only thing I'm addicted to is nicotine and weed, and I've almost quit both of those (vaping lowest amount of nic and smoking once a week).

My problem lies with binging. I don't know if this sub is the right one to post about this but I couldn't find one more fitting.

I go to parties about once or twice a month. Half of them go well (some beer and shots, just enough to get drunk) but the other half...

Sometimes I completely lose control of myself as soon as I get drunk. For example. I went to a party two weeks ago, planning to get a bit drunk and go to sleep.
Instead I took enough shots to get a BAC of 1.2, I snorted 60 mg's methylphenidate, took a large dose of edibles and 2 joints, and an unknown amount of GHB.

Let's just say it took 2 days until I was sober again. Now I don't want to quit alcohol and other drugs, I just want to be able to control myself but I don't know how.

Don't know if anyone can even give me any advice (except for total abstinence) but it just feels good to vent.

2019-11-27 11:39:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/e2ilmn/the_journey_so_far/,The journey so far.,"Guess I will start at the beginning. Started doing drugs at an early age. I have an older brother that got me into huffing gas at the age of 11. I wanted to be like him and fit in and have friends. He is 6 years older than me. That turned into smoking weed. I did that for a few years then found out about pain pills after a few accidents. Didn't start drinking until I was 17. I drank just to kill time until I could find something stronger, I guess since I started at a young age I could handle more than everyone else. 

When turned 18 I discovered LSD and rode that train for awhile. Didn't start doing the hard stuff until later. When I was about 22 I was Introduced to Crank, cocaine, and anything I could get my hands on that I could get high off of. I didn't care if I lived or died. Getting high was my only concern. I didn't care who I hurt. I had become a monster and I was really good at it. This went on for a while.

My whole life revolved around drugs, I couldn't function without them. All I did was work to pay for my drugs. 

I did manage to get off the meth for a short time and just did coke. Then life kicked me in the balls and I went back to meth. This went on until I turned 29. 

When I turned 29. Not sure how I survived that long but I did. I met someone that changed everything for me. For the first time in my life I wanted something more than drugs. She saved my life. I quit everything but weed. She wouldn't have anything to do with me while I was using. It was a rough time bit I did it. We started dating and then got married a year later. The only problem is that i was no longer the fun loving guy that i was while i was using and got overwhelmed by everything. When we got divorced my worse fear was that I would start using again. I did coke once and hated myself for it. Other that weed I have been drug free since. Going on 14 years now. 

I still have cravings. Every day is a battle for me but if I can help someone with their addiction maybe my life won't be a complete waste. 

There is a lot more to my story but didn't want to bore everyone to death.

Weed for me is a problem in the way not by itself but my mind goes to well I can have a drink to what about some coke or etc. I told a few of my good friends and they already stopped inviting me to things and I understand it's in a nice way but it still hurts to not be invited if that makes sense because I wouldn't of been able to go no matter what. Winterbreaka were always when it was more socially acceptable to use like I did infront of them. This winterbeeak feels like it's going to be nothing but NA and recovery. I know that's what I need right now but I miss my friends and not the using alone by myself when it was really bad or the overdoses but the casual party usage with my friends. I said to a few of them I can still hangout if they are not using and are sober when we hangout and only one of them said that's fine. Recovery sucks for right now. Right now my life is just recovery college and work and when I see people I'm either talking about recovery or I'm at school talking about school. People from school ask to hangout who are people who dont like to get drunk or use drugs and I have to say no because my sponsor tells me to go to meetings every day and fellowship after the meeting so I'm usually not done with recovery stuff until 10ish11 every night.

I dont feel an itch but rather i feel a level of anxiety that only dissappears with alcohol, weed, video games, anything that will put my mind on autopilot. I cant put my finger on the issue but it seems like its not just a substance problem. I can drop alcohol, weed (already have for months on end) and i have never tried hard drugs but i always go back to fucking my life up with anything that will distract me from my life, this can be video games, table top games (yes i fucking put a lot into magic the gathering for example). Not really sure if im looking for help here or just checking if im not the only asshole with this problem. I cant seem to focus on my degree which i ended up postponing for a year and i cant seem to find balance in life. Any tips are welcome. Already started therapy btw but just wanted to vent.

EDIT:
Well it has been a while since i posted on this here forum but i'll give an update and a general perspective on what the journey has been since hitting the low i hit when i posted this and now.

I started therapy to treat the root of my problems which seem to be a combination of things, starting with an abusive childhood (non sexual physical and mental abuse). 
There is no end in sight for my vices and my compulsive behavior but i have found however a way to get out of the headspace that usually lands me in the vicious cycle of drugs alcohol video games and any other vice i could get my hands on. The solution for me is a combination of the advice given by some of my fellow redditors in the comments. One of the biggest ones is the simple action of building healthy habits one at a time. The first real change i saw in productivity and the rest of my life followed suit was getting out of my house and doing shit far from home. It conditioned me mentally to do the task at hand rather than seek the escape. The best exmple is my graduate thesis which i left unatteded for about a year. It took me one day of going to my public library and sitting down with my laptop, which has plenty of ways to take the attention away from me but the fact i had gone there to complete a specific task put me in the mindset. Therapy has been for me the biggest help, but only when i do it honestly and trusting the methodology and the professional. In all honesty i doubt ill be able to kick all vices, not because i am a pessimist but because i honestly enjoy playing games, drinking, smoking weed and such. It just is fun for me, but i can thankfully also see when something has gotten out of hand and for the moment nothing really dominates my life like heroin would an addict for example. The addiction is not physical for me, it is a mental thing. I thank everyone who replied and i am surprised at the turnout for people who are going through something similar. One of the bigger things for me was feeling like i was broken and the worst part was feeling like no one could understand what i meant or how i felt. The truth is i have a hard time with emotions and with interpersonal relationships because of a very traumatic past and for me it has been a catalyst for the development of shitty habits and attitudes that put me in a vicious cycle of vice and a general retreat from life and people. Im not saying that has to happen to you to be like this or to feel this way but for me the answer lied there. In a place of mental health. I cannot stress enough how letting go of prejudice against mental health professionals (which for the longest time i thought were subjective philosophers rather than scientific professionals) was what gave me access to better my understanding of myself and my pathology. Those two things (Small goals and changes in habit and therapy) were the things that have since bettered my life and consequently my outlook on life. 

Hope this post helps anyone who feels lost or generally shitty.

Not proud of what I did. Is it fair to say that relapsing is a natural and possibly expected part of getting over the addiction? Or are you expected to be perfect with going cold turkey? Is it just some lame excuse to have some more? My gf thinks so.

Naturally my brain is trying to justify that what I did wasn't that bad. Some smokers/alcoholics relapse a few times before quitting for good. Again is this just another excuse trying to justify the next relapse?

My drugs of choice were benzos, alcohol, and weed.

My boyfriend(28M) isn't an addict, but he only drinks one or two drinks on rare occasions and doesn't do any drugs (never has) so it is helpful in my recovery. The issue I have been feeling as of lately is I don't want to go to events with his friends because there is always drinking. Last week he went to a tailgate with friends and I didn't go and honestly I was happier that way because I don't feel like being around alcohol. Even if people aren't getting shit faced I still don't want to smell it or have to stand around watching everyone drink while I sip on water.

Now we got invited to go to a New Years party at one of his friends houses. He asked ""well how about we just go around dinner so people won't really be drinking much and then we can leave before it gets bad"". I don't want to be around it at all though. I am a shy person as it is and I won't know any of those people and then I will feel like a black sheep on top of it because I will be the only one without a drink in my hand. I just have no desire or patience to be around people who are drinking. It's one thing to have to sit at a dinner with people who have one glass of wine, but to have to stand around in a group of people who are all sipping their drinks right in my face its just not fun for me. It gives me cravings and I don't want to feel that. I have been doing so well and I can only contribute that to the fact that I haven't had to be around alcohol lately.

I'm sorry for how long this will be but Im not sure what else to do and maybe laying out the events of my story in chronological order will help me to decide what I need to do moving forward.

I know weed isn't that crazy of a drug and I'd agree, it's relatively mild. I also think it has great benefits for some people and support legalization. But I've been smoking heavily everyday for 7 years and I've realized I'm allowing it to severely control my life. 

I smoke before I do anything and I used to feel like it made everything more fun but now it feels like it just simply makes things bearable. Addiction runs heavily in my family. Both of my parents are alcoholics with my dad being functional and probably considered relatively ""normal"" and my mom being an extreme alcoholic. Because of this I always swore I wouldn't be like them and stayed away from alcohol most of my life, Im 25 and still only drink very rarely.

My parents were never together/married and my younger years were spent with only my mom. She struggled very very heavily with alcohol when I was younger. I was eventually taken away from her and placed with my dad but around 2nd grade she sobered up and in 6th grade I was allowed to live with her again. Things went well besides normal growing pains until my senior year when my grandmother passed away. Her and my mother had a lot of things left unsaid and it weighed on my mother heavily. She started drinking again but her and my step father hid it from me to the point where I thought she was having a mental breakdown or getting early Alzheimer's or something until I finally found a handle of vodka in her closet. I was devastated that she was drinking again, as I knew how impossibly hard it seemed for her to sober up the first time.

I had smoked weed in high school with friends on a couple occasions but that was it. I was angry that she was drinking, and I felt betrayed/mad that it was hidden from me and that she was coping in this way. I wanted some way to cope too but was still very scared of becoming a drunk so I avoided alcohol. I started asking my friends for weed and would smoke it in my closet alone. It was a magical escape and it felt great to be in my own little world away from my negative reality. 

Fast forward 7 years and I smoke heavily, multiple times everyday, constantly trying to suppress negative thoughts and feelings. I feel in a constant state of mental discomfort. The slightest task can feel overwhelming and the second I mess up, even the tiniest bit, I begin to put myself down. My self esteem is at an all time low and I frequently think of suicide. I thought getting a job I wanted would help my self esteem but it hasn't. I put on a happy face but have come to resent my co workers and boss and often want to just quit and go home to smoke and think about nothing. But it has gotten more and more difficult to think about nothing. My mind races with regrets and thoughts of time wasted. I think of how much I have pulled away socially from family and friends and can't help but feel like I have let them down by becoming who I am now. 

I had so much help growing up from friends and extended family who were supportive and kind. They loved, nurtured and cared for me and I show my thanks by pathetically succumbing to my own vices. I wish I could explain to them what I feel. I want them to know I want to be better, to be different than I am now. I want to believe that this is not all that I am but it is getting harder and harder to imagine anything else when the days keep going by faster and faster and my mind struggles to keep up. Memories are hazy and I know I'm not remembering things as clearly as I should but sometimes I get a glimpse of hope, whether it be a familiar smell or song from when I was a child and for a moment I feel how I felt before I was addicted and I so badly want to go back but I don't know how. 

I feel fairly certain that I have more to deal with mentally than just my addiction. I've dealt with depression, self esteem and suicidal thoughts since I was very young but I feel I cant make progress on those fronts until I deal with my addiction. But I feel like I'm running out of time.

I lost her to addiction at 18, and have only seen her sober once in those four years. We went out to breakfast, and she was back at her dealers house that afternoon.

Last night she showed up on my doorstep, sober. We talked for a while and she slept on my couch and in three morning we drank coffee and talked about life. It was SO good to see that she is still the intelligent, empathetic, amazing person that I lost years ago! I miss her so much... And I truly had come to peace with the fact that I would likely never see her alive again. 

She snuck off and got high. I had to tell her that she could not be in my house in that state and she had to leave. I was loving, but firm. I told her I would take her anywhere she wanted to go, but she is not welcome in my house high as I have three children and refuse to enable her. She was angry, but respectful, and I think even in her state she understands my position. 
I washed her clothes, gave her some socks, and let her dye her hair, and then I made her leave. Per her request I took her to a town 30 minutes away.

During the drive we listened to music, and at one point I reached over, grabbed her hand, and held it tight. We both cried. I told her how much I loved her and how happy I was to see that she was still my beloved little cousin, that I understand she’s struggling, and we will always be family. We turned the music up and sang together until I dropped her off.

I am proud of my boundaries, and I know I left the window open to her when/if she’s ready for recovery. I miss her so much.

I am looking for diverse individuals to complete an online IRB approved survey that will take approximately 15 to 20-minutes. To be included in the study, you must be at least 18 years of age, possess English proficiency, and be living in the United States. The survey has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB; STUDY00144682) at the University of Kansas. 

The current study is a part of my dissertation research, which examines the relationship between multiple diverse identities and help-seeking intentions for mental health concerns. The study possesses minimal risk and has the opportunity to directly benefit you by obtaining mental health and mental health service resources provided at the end of the online survey. Further, we believe that the information obtained from this study will help us gain a better understanding of how diverse groups perceive and intend to seek mental health services. 

The survey is available at the link below:

I met him at a one off meeting held in a meeting space in a church. I went to a meeting last night at a sober space that has a meeting pretty much every 2 hours. I can already tell I really like the community of people there, and I like that it’s an actual building dedicated to AA. When I attended, a really nice person offered to be my sponsor. 

I’m wondering if I should “fire” my temporary sponsor for this second so I can have a connection to this other community/space?

Iv heard people tell me I’m just getting gaba withdrawals but even when I’m on it the withdrawals won’t go away.

Please excuse any shortcomings that follow, I'm new to this. 

My sister has been an addict for the past 12 years.  I can't remember how many times she has over dosed, but this time she will remain in the hospital for an undetermined amount of time. The time before this, she coded in the ER and they were able to resuscitate her. 

Years of abuse has left my mother in a state where she's come to terms with my sisters inevitable death, but I haven't.  I'm looking for options at this point, any legal recourse I can take on my own.  Her husband, in my opinion, enables her by refusing to admit she's an addict and that she needs therapy.  My sister denies she's an addict and that she even has a problem. 

We have a small and somewhat distant family.  I live in the Midwest while most of my family, (sister included) live on the East Coast.  She's married with a six year old.  My mother, aunt and uncle all live close by and are able to watch her child on a whim, which is quite often. 

I'm looking for any and all options.  I want my niece out of that situation and I want to help my sister at all costs.  Is there any legal recourse I can take to have my sister committed to rehab? I heard some rehab facilities can just be a ploy to take your money.  How can I choose the right one?  Can I take temporary custody of my niece?

I am going to go on a rant here and you don’t have to read it but I just have to get it out. I am really struggling with everything going on in my life. (Sorry for my grammar) some of the reasons I feel into addiction (18m now),"So I’ll start from when I was 14. I was actually not doing to bad mentally yet but I had a lot problems. One day when I came home from school my mother came up to me and I could instantly tell that something was completely off. (She never talks to me about feelings or anything really) well she takes me to the couch and explains why my sister has been absent the last couple months. She starts crying uncontrollably while explaining but eventually she said it. My sister had been trying to kill herself multiple times and got put in a closed section in a hospital. I love my sister to bits so the news naturally screwed my brain. I got so angry! I was angry all the time. If someone bumped into me I would punch them without hesitation. I was filled with negative emotions and I couldn’t take the stress. I had been smoking hash for about a year on and off but now it turned into a daily thing. Smoked before school in school after school, basically all the time. I was permanently paranoid because I was walking around everyday without knowing if my sister would die. She kept trying to suicide for about a year (the hash definitely made the paranoia worse). I don’t know what happened but suddenly I wasn’t filled with negative emotions but not happy emotions either, I was left with nothing... completely numb. My memories started fading I was tired all the time. I stopped attending school. All I did was smoke, party and sleep. This got worse and worse. I stopped doing anything. I would be in my room for weeks at a time, not leaving the flat. This is getting really long, I appreciate if you are still reading. Okay so I am going to fast forward a little. Last year of school, they let me take my exams even though I hadn’t really attended school for 2 years. I of course messed it up.. I got really anxious (yay finally some kinda feeling great huh) so I went to all my exams high. Okay I am going to stop here. I would appreciate if someone would listen to what happens the next couple years because that’s where my life really goes to shit. Quick resume of my years from 16-18. Weed, Cocaine, Alcohol, Ketamine and MDMA abuse. Trouble with the law (stabbed someone, he is fine nothing really happened but the law is still the law.

I've known for years that I've used drugs to escape the duller less appealing aspects of my life including boredom, stress, anxiety, and sadness. 

After quiting drugs, I had to face these issues without my most proven coping mechanism. It has been an awful 2 months for me as a result.
 
I'm beginning to realize that a bit of escapism is healthy. For me personally the drug use and side effects that went along with it, such as cravings and withdrawals were not healthy. 

Quiting drugs seems to have slowly lowered my escapism threshold. Today, I found pleasure in simply doing the dishes. I didn't have to think about all of my problems. I played some music and calmy cleaned. 

This feels like a healthy form of escapism. I didn't confront my major problems, mostly school related. But it was a necessary break from the endless anxiety I felt lately, and also now the kitchen is clean! 

I used to beat myself up over not being productive while on stimulants, it got to the point where I'd struggle to watch a movie without thinking of all the other more impotant things I could be doing. I never really let myself enjoy anything at all during that period. It was always on to the next task. Eventually, I burnt myself out this way because I never really let myself relax. 

To sum it up, life can become too difficult without some form of escapism. Hopefully, a bit of escapism will allow me to approach other tasks with more energy and enthusiasm. I'd like to be able to live my life  without being in a constant state of anxiety or depression. 

I'd like to learn to slow down and enjoy things more. My goal now is to be grateful for these calmer periods of everyday life. I want them to leave me satisfied and ready to take on more difficult challenges.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6035140156745911}"

I caved and now I have relapsed, I feel comfortable now in my active addiction. This is home","Im a 15 year old addict from Florida, This is my story. (my spelling is really bad I'm sorry)

Hey, I'm reaching out because I feel stranded. I used to feel lonely, but now I'm separated from my family, my friends, and I'm sitting in ISS at my boarding school in Utah. I feel so weak and hopeless at this point, I feel like i'm crazy, im fucked in the head.

So my using began about two years ago, I was in 7th grade when I smoked weed for the first time. I was with some older friends of mine at the time and we were smoking at the community playground late at night. For my first time I ended up taking two bong rips and packing a few bowls, I coughed for what seemed like 10 minutes. After the coughing had ended I had finally felt the effects, I was high, really high.. And I loved it. I felt lifted, I was happy and we were all having a great time. We all hung around the park laughing with each other for about an hour and then we decided to go back to their house where we would be spending the night. This friend of mine also happened to be my little sister's friend's older brother.  When we walked into the house we all reeked like bud, my eyes were red, and I was paranoid as fuck. While walking back into the bedroom I had tripped over the dog gate that was separating the two sides of the house. My sister and her friend came out of their room, and they knew something was up. At this point I was scared, so I came clean to my sister and she called my dad. My dad came, picked me up, brought me home, and then shaved off all of my hair as a ""punishment"". This was just the beginning.

After this punishment I had been scared to ever get in trouble for drugs ever again.. so i finished that school year and the next without ever touching ANYTHING. And it wasn't until freshman year of highschool that I had started to begin vaping nicotine. I continued to do solely only use nicotine for about another month, then I started to vape THC and use wax carts.. like every other highschooler in America. I would get high every day, before my sports practices, games, when I woke up, in school, before bed... It was constant. I began to see myself differently, I became more depressed than I already was and my using that was ""recreational"" and ""social"" soon became a way of self medicating.  I began to drink alcohol every single day, I would steal from convienent stores and my dad's liquor cabinet. I would get cross-faded every single day with no regard whatsoever. And on christmas eve i got so drunk under my moms supervision that she had temporarily lost custody of me and my sisters. The drinking and smoking went on for about another 5 months, and then I started to experiment with LSD and I began to abuse that. Me and my friends went on an acid binge for about a week over winter break. We all fell in love with acid at this time and we had said that it ""changed our lives"". But on the last day of this binge I had my first bad trip. This experience was horrorfying, my vision consisted of a kaleidoscope made up of  faces that had red eyes and sharp teeth staring at me. I was extremely paranoid and I was scared out of my mind. This 12 hours of madness changed me forever.

Fast  forward about another month or so I continued to drink and smoke daily, alongside the usual vaping. And then one night I had ran away from home as a result of my dad posting an embarassing picture of me online with my dilated pupils staring into the camera., I walked about 7 miles to an abandoned house that me and my homies would hang out at. I ended up getting a ride to my other friends house from one of my dealers and then that next day me and my friend whos house I stayed at that night went to school the next day and I had my cart on me as usual along with some bud. It was in 4th period that two cops and the hall monitor showed up to my classroom and asked to speak with me. They brought me down to their office where they had told me there was a report of me having illegal drugs on campus. I was searched and I was found with the bud and the cart. I was expelled from all of the schools in my county and I was going to be brought down to the juvenile assesment center for my arrest of ""possesion of a controlled substance"" where I would get my mugshot taken along with all my finger prints etc etc... But I had told the transporter that I was depressed and that I was thinking about killing myself. I was brought down to the local hospital where I stayed in the mental health unit for 5 days, then brought to get my assesment done right after that, then brought to a real mental health hospital when I told the lady doing my assesment that I wanted to die. I was in this hospital for 8 days where I slept on the floor for 5 of the days since I was on ""suicide watch"". On the 7th day I had received a phone call from my mom. She told me that I was ordered to go to rehab by the court. I left for rehab on my 8th day and I was in residential treatment for 7 weeks.

I left rehab and I was then going to be living with my grandparents temporarily. I wasn't in school at this time and I started to work. I was working two jobs, one as a dishwasher and the other being a construction job. I was on a probation program and I was going to be getting tested monthly. I got around this by using OTC drugs such as DPH, DXM, and dramamine. I didn't really like these drugs but I had used them since it was all I could get figuring that I didn't have a cell phone and I was living in a different area.  I also picked up cigarettes instead of vaping, I prefer smokin cigs since It's more of a ritual and I felt like it soothed me. I would continue to overdose on benadryl every single night. I began to develop a high tolerance for DPH and I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I didn't take at least 15 of them. I ended up having a severe panic attack that resulted in me running away from my grandparents house to a neighbors house asking to use their phone so that I could call my mom. My mom came and picked me up and I went on to live with her for about two weeks. We were going to AA meetings together and I made it seem like I was getting my shit together. This was a lie since I was starting to use dxm nightly, smoke and drink daily, and then start to use acid again. This resulted in me running away again and putting myself into the mental hospital. I stole two scripts of gabapentin from my mom's friend and a box of ZZZquil from a gas station and I took the entire box of zzquil and 1500mg of gaba when the cops had found me sitting outside the hospital. I was bakeracted for 7 days this time and afterwords I had finally gone back home to my dad.

While I was living with my dad I had a cell phone, and I had began to get my connections back alongside new connections. I started seeking out more drugs, harder ones. I started to abuse everything... I was abusing amphetamines like adderall and vyvanse, xanax, molly, acid, various painkillers (dilaudid, percs, oxys, tramadol, hydros, vicodin), OTCS ( dph, dxm, dramamine) , cocaine, I experimented with heroin and spice at one point, and I had done other drugs unintentionally like MDA, N-BOME, and im sure a few others. I was going to places that I didn't want to be, I started selling drugs to pay for my habbit, and I was robbing people when I was broke. But I can always find a way to get high no matter where I am or how much money I had. I would crush up stolen medication and my own medication and I would snort those to get a dirty pharma high. I would take a shit ton of benadryl with my painkillers to potentiate them. I would mix anything and everything regardless of the risks associated with it as long as I got the best high. I became an addict. I ended up committing some serious crimes where I had stabbed a local dealer, I vandalized a kid's house doing $14k in damages. I was hurting myself and the people around me. I was back in school and then that had only lasted about two weeks until I got kicked out of that school when I popped two bars and drank half a bottle of wine the night prior and showed up hungover.

As a result of all this I was sent to a wilderness therapy program in southern Utah. I was there for 11 weeks and I just got out last thursday, this was my longest time being sober and it was for 78 days. I have torn apart my family and put them at risk, I disrespected my girlfriend and her family by selling drugs out of their house, I have become even more ill and unstable and at times I can't even trust myself. I'm struggling with my identity and I feel so lost. I'm too scared to come out as bisexual to my parents and to the people at my school, I feel like I cant talk about the voices that I hear in my head while im alone, I feel like I'm way to indecisive and my mood constantly changes. I am alone and I just want to be with the people I love. I need stability.

I'm sorry for how long this is if u read it.,"Okay so I'm new to Reddit and don't know how to do the special names or whatever the fucc y'all do so if I do it wrong show how to do it correctly if I post again.

I'll start it off with a little insight into my past and things that have had an effect on me this building who I am and ect. 

I was born into my father in a gang doing what he can to pay for food and a spot to live while supporting my mom that had a struggle with drugs, same as my father. By the time I was 3 my dad was back in prison and my mom got real bad so me and my older brother finally had family willing to take us instead of going to DHS. My brother was 5 years old and I was 3 years old. The both of us didn't know how to speak, (we had our personal way to communicate tho) eat proper food other then McDonald's french fries and baby food, we had barely any clothes and got lucky if they fit, wasn't poddy trained, and a few more important things we should have known or been practicing. My grandma and grandpa (my dad's side) raised us along with my cousin who is a different story. After my mom got sober and my father got out of prison 4 or 5 years later we spent 1 year with my father then my mom took me and my brother back and continued every other weekend visits with him for a vast amount of years. 

Fast forward past a few of my mom's ex boyfriends and husband's. My mom calmed down with my step father she had a kid who is my beloved little sister. Got married after they had her and maybe a year of dating before hand. I remember I didn't do the dishes and wanted to send me to a military school. We move in and I ain't feeling it there it was a depressing angry environment. I was close enough to my step mother and my bio dad to move in with them. (I was 13 14 years old then) 

⚔️I know it's kinda dragging on but I'm tryna only put the minimum amount of info so it isn't like a fuccin book. ⚔️

So when I move in there were only a few months maybe a half a year into it when things started falling apart there too. I at this point had gotten really close with my step mom and my bio dad so I decided that imma stick around and ride this out. After my step mother (who was in charge of all bills and finances of the house hold) gets us evicted 2 times, messes up payments on two new cars, but doesn't fail to buy the newest makeup and has to get her and her daughter such Bros all of the time. (I could care less if we got coffee but when your struggling this hard financially making sure your kids get coffee every morning and afternoon. In my opinion) 

Thing get bad with their fighting when we are hitting the 3rd eviction. (I later hind out she did this cuz she was jealous of the attention my father game me. She said it herself) their fights got louder and more violent and then wants to bring me into the middle of them too while twisting up the story so I favor her. Remember I haven't know them good for long. Moving day is here and both her and he daughter lay in bed all day while me and my father are packing and moving the whole fuccing house. Their shit too. They just sit there. 

We got basically 3/4ths done and desterbed the step mother by taking the bed way to move. She is pissed talking all kinds of shit and right before we tore down the grow room for our weed. (all legal believe it or not) we found a fuccin courter pound of coke. I shit you not! She was walking around talking how she wished she wanted some coke, then tried to blame it on me. The fucc? That was her drug of choice back in the day before she meet my father. We got everything packed ready to go, and where we go now? We move into the basement of one of my dad's old homies that was a bachelor. There was a big ass living room 1 bedroom 1 bathroom and laundry room with a mountain of shit that you can barely enter the room. We clean it us as good as we can. We make 2 rooms in the living room by throwing my step sister s bed and mine under the ping pong table. Shit better then nothing. 

Shit gets to the point where I don't wanna go back to my mom's but I sure don't wanna be anywhere near the girls. I end up getting hella stoned and pretty tipsy and shit with dude upstairs. He was a dope guy so far and he mad respect at the time.  Also to elaborate on another reason why I didn't want to be at my mom's is because she is really good at fuccing up my mentality and emotions verbally but not in a aggressive way idk how that works. Anyway shit escalates as you would expect with a crazy party girl and a gangster fighting. 

So my step mom tried to shoot someone, idk who exactly to this day. Thru the wall at me? My dad? Her self? I know she was aware of me on the other side of the wall too. After that I can sum up the rest of the time with them around simply. The chech it I was hella depressed before moving in with my dad and went to a hospital for it. Both my dad and step dad said some shit that snapped me into reality and that it's shitty but worth living still.well he killed himself within this time frame, the day after my mom dropped off the finalized devorce papers. Shit himself in the downstairs bathroom of his fathers house. 

My step mom and dad get sent up on this lick they went to go hit and my dad already was looking at hella time being a 7 time convict and ect but my mom didn't seem to care most of the time. She got twacked out of her mind. She would stalk us and almost every day send me pictures of how she was gunna try and kill herself so I could make my dad go back to her. I finally said fucc it I don't care anymore (I still regret saying) she would start breaking into shit shooting at us, getting into midnight speed chases, telling us that she wanted my father to shot her then me to do it after. Man so much more but I'll leave it there. By the time sentencing came around for my dad (got held 2 years after offense) I had been around and learning what he use to do back in the day. I now had connections respect power and protection. I was getting ready to take my father's spot in the game to be able to have ways to get $ for his books and myself out the outs. I WOULD AND WILL NEVER SELL MY PUSSY FOR MONEY OR DRUGS. I had to make it clear. But I got named after to him and did really good and had a good flip going.

I've tried to stop that life style now n days tho. After seeing my my mom cry to my so many times to not do it, seeing my close ass cuz, more like family get torchered and shit in the face 6 times over shit that didn't add up to being anywhere near worth 100$. Seeing so many people get hit and go to the pin too. Lose their kids and homes cuz of their addiction, hearing my dad over a collect call beging me to cool it cuz he had enemy's and they know I've taken his place. He can't protect me from their like he could out here, then my step mom who's years where limited cuz of shit done did before 2010 and finding out she has cancer too. I fixed things with her too I like her sober so much more. And so much more. My father got 15 years and barely got 1 year down. 


WHY CANT I STOP HATING MYSELF AND EVERYTHING ABOUT ME NOW

My mom and I have a shaky relationship now and she said it won't be able to be the same. I'm trying so hard to impress her and make her proud. I went to rehab, In groups, going to school again with good grades, yet I can't do anything right.

She wants me to tell her ever single detail of everything and I'm trying to I really am but it's not good enough. I tell her exactly wassup and even if what I did was wrong I take my shit and all of that. Why can't I be like my siblings. Why do I have to be the problem child and why is it so hard . I understand what my mom is coming through and her side of things but there is a line to it. She has done past it. I'm giving up and losing motivation. I don't wanna talk to anyone I know about this too. 



If you read all of this imma thank you now cuz I'm hella thankful that someone took some time for a random chicks problemz. If you got any kinda feed back, let's here it. 


Also I been in my thoughts all night and I'm writing this hella late so I'm sorry if I suck at writing this. I didn't know where to post also.",24,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9854533076286316}"

I think I might be a sex addict. And I really need some people who understand and some support. 

In fact, I think I’ve known for a long time but I always thought I could control it. That it was just a fun thing to do and I could stop any time... I guess that’s the whole thing with addiction right?

I can’t remember when I started acting out. I’ve always been obsessed with pornography, often masturbating multiple times in the room right near my family. I was almost caught countless times. I’ve been catfished online and been recorded masturbating and blackmailed, and in high school publicly shamed on web cam, I’ve had multiple online-based relationships, and in the last five years I’ve become addicted to and spent $1,000s on happy ending massages. I had a “slut phase” which I generally wear as a badge of honour, but I hurt so many nice girls and didn’t care st the time. I got caught it by my ex girlfriend and have cheated many times. We tried to reconcile but it never worked. 

I feel like I’m two different people. I am a confident, well-liked and generally happy person with a beautiful girlfriend and great friends, job and life. I don’t have much to be sad about or anything like that. It is a secret shame of mine and I feel like I carry this weight around with me every day. I convince myself that I am sore and need a massage and then “enjoy” the chase of finding a dodgy massage parlour and negotiating a deal with them. I always feel so much shame and clarity after I finish and I hate myself for it. 

I don’t know what trauma I am running from and I hate that I can’t control this part of my life. Sometimes I feel like I’m a psychopath and sometimes I feel deep empathy and care so it leaves me confused. 

I want to get this under control before my current, beautiful, caring and loving girlfriend of almost 3 years finds out and leaves me and destroys my entire life. Writing this feels good.

For example, in the past month, I have had elaborate fantasies about: (a) doing a bar crawl where I try ten different cocktails; (b) binge-eating an entire large pizza; and (c) joining a dating app and scheduling a series of hookups.

Mind you - I don't actually do any of these things. After two drinks max I just don't want anymore, same thing with a couple pizza slices, and I don't want to do the work of dating right now. However, I'm losing a lot of headspace to these thoughts.

I do have an extremely busy and stressful life (very high-pressure job with long hours on top of extensive family responsibilities) and basically don't have much time to myself.

I'm seeing a therapist and have asked if these thoughts are harmless escapism or something more serious - she said that if I'm feeling guilty about them (I do!) that's a good indication there's something wrong and that I need to be on my guard for falling into alcohol, food and sex addictions. Also, (her feedback is that) the thoughts are taking up time that could be put to more productive activities - I could be doing something useful instead of planning my next non-existent bar crawl.

2019-11-20 14:41:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/dz754u/long_post_about_nicotine/,Long post about nicotine,"I've quit vaping my juul nicotine device. Today is my 9th day cold turkey. Thank you :)

That's the abridged version. 

Now here's the unabridged version:

I've smoked since I was 17, and it was a total accident that I slipped into addiction. I never saw it coming, until I would get throat infections OFTEN! I would smoke through the sickness. That's a good example of an addiction being so persistent in the fibers of your being, that you'll make yourself not only sick, but even sicker.

I'm now 27, and that didnt cross my mind until just now that it's been ten years with nicotine. 

My first attempt at quitting smoking was great! My friend and I drunkenly threw each others' packs into the street when we were hammered, and woke up the next day to a new competition. ""Whoever breaks first, is a ~loser~"" we both barely remembered it, but were so stubbornly competitive, that we both complied to the new game.

I had been vaping then too, but it was so easy to cut that one out (not a juul) because it was so finicky, and would break, and leak all the time. So the next day when I didnt have smokes,* and* my vape broke, I snapped it literally in half, and said ""eff the vape for sure"". I threw it away, and honestly never looked back at nicotine until one day.

One day about 1.5 years into that, my car got demolished by a drunk driver, and to cope with the sight, the smell, and that chaos.... I took up smoking again. Other really stressful things were going on too, and I was not looking back.. :(

Fast forward a bit to a little more than a year ago. The guy at my smoke shop raved about juul, and said it helped him quit. That seemed great to me, so I got myself a starter pack. I was into the ease of use with the pods. I was not a fan of the price. And the frequency I was using them :/ so for the new year, I had decided that I wanted to be done with the juul...ok... 11 months in and I'm finally getting to it. 

I lost my darn juul stick for the last time last monday. I looked pretty incessantly... but alas, it was no where. So... I think to myself, ""would it really be that bad, or scary if you just stopped altogether?"" Turns out yess... it was bad, and still is. 

I'm on edge, constantly, my mood is flat, but yet i'm grumpy and irritable. You know what's keeping me going, though, friend? The fact that I dont look like a fiend with my little USB stick; the fact that I'm going to save (I kid you not) $200 a month...$2,400 a year; That I dont have to keep my addiction constantly charging all day long.

I'm putting that money in a seperate account from my savings, and who knows what I'll be able to do with it. 

So yeah... my moods is wretched right now. At least I feel like I'm winning at something :)",20,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9966020584106445}"

I used to smoke cigarettes sometimes, was a bit addicted here and there.  But I never smoked more than about 1 or 2 a day on average.  But with the e-cig, I smoke it basically non stop when I can.  This is because I can smoke it indoors, take a few drags here and there without ""lighting up a cigarette,"" and it doesn't feel (probably isn't) nearly as bad for you.  

But now I'm more addicted to nicotine.  There could still be health consequences, and I'm tired of trying to hide it from some people - my parents, or a date, for example - by taking drags in the bathroom.  I really can't feel any negative effects in my lungs, like I could with cigarettes.  And this makes it incredibly difficult to quit.

This is my first post on this subreddit and second on this site altogether. I'm not really sure why I've decided to make an account today...I guess I'm just not really sure how my life has gone this far in the wrong direction in the last couple of years. I really have nobody I feel like I can speak to about this so here it goes...

I just turned 33 last month. Up until around 2015 I feel like I had most everything ""somewhat under control."" However, after making a major mistake in fall of 2015, I have since become a complete shell of old self for what will be going on half a decade next year.

Most my life I was well liked, had good girlfriends/friends most of the time, was social, happy go lucky, glass half full, etc. BUT....

Over these last couple of years I regularly have dealt with depression, anxiety, lack of self worth, etc. I've isolated myself so much that I barely have anybody to talks to, hang out with, or text on a regular basis. Nobody really to talk to. I've resulted in drinking alcohol alone maybe 3 nights/week and going pretty hard on the weekends by myself while staying in and watching tv/sports.

I've been gambling A TON and losing more than I've won so I'm pretty deep in debt now to the point that I'm worried my employer is going to be contacted about garnishing my wages from loan collectors. I mean I was taking out payday loans and not repaying quick enough, maxing cards out and only being able to put minimum payments back. I get so bored and lonely that all I do is gambling a TON of games over a TON of round robins, then if I win anything I try to ""hit it big on the online casino"" (since I've hit it big a time or two but then end up pissing it back away).

 My entire life has turned upside down and every day I wake up dreading going through the day, just waiting to get home so I can pop some sleep aids in (insomnia has become a thing too) and/or drink and gamble to get me to the next day. The only plus to my life right now is that it hasn't really affected my work....but I'm worried with new leadership something could go wrong there at any time now (could be just my lack of self worth thinking that, I don't know. I am a really good/hard/reliable worker. Just waiting for the final nail in the coffin I suppose).

I'm concerned I've ruined my life. I know it's possible to turn around but my motivation is lacking. Every time I try to get in the zone to go be more social, have a heathier lifestyle, stop blowing money I don't have and save for a while, etc. I seem to fall back into the same pattern (a pattern for over 4 years now). I'm worried I've gone too far to where I'll barely be able to get a loan for a car, never be able to buy my own house, save for retirement, etc. Just every time I get any sort of extra money under my belt I immediately try to turn it into more by using the rest of the paycheck to try and recover some more.

I'm not sure why I think posting on here will help. Maybe I'm feeling I'm out of options and nobody to talk to? Maybe I just want someone to relate to me? Maybe I need advice or told it will be okay if I turn it around starting NOW? I have no idea. I'm just worried I've been treading water, hanging by a string the last couple of years and now I'm in too deep and it's took late. Anyways, thanks for anybody who reads this and can offer advice, ways to get things turned around.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992569088935852}"

I've had the occasional drink every couple months or so but very mild usage and nothing past a day or two. A month ago I had been abstinent from all the substances I was taking; alcohol, kratom, phenibut, cigarettes, and weed. Was only taking gabapentin, which I'm prescribed (was somewhat abusing but nothing excessive). I came into some extra money when I worked my ass off one week. The next day I decide to get drunk, (around 12 beers in 4-5 hours). The next day repeated itself and the cycle has continued until today. Here's a before and after description of where I'm at now compared to a month ago.


A month ago:


I was abstinent from all things except gabapentin. I'd even quit drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. My bills were finally caught up and I was beginning to work on my debts. I had been behind on my bills for quite a while. I switched to a self employment job where I only work when I need to or want to. The first month I didn't work at all because of bad depression so got really behind. Catching up was a big deal because I had worked my ass off to get there. My overall energy levels were great. I was cooking and eating regularly. Not eating fast food. I was taking care of my hygeine regularly; teeth, showering, washing clothes, etc. I was cleaning my car regularly (I live and work from my car so keeping things in order and clean is really important). I was on a pretty good schedule, waking up earlier and going to sleep earlier. I was working regularly, making about $800/wk or more. I was working towards getting a place to stay. Overall things were going really good compared to a year ago but evidently I wanted to burn everything down and start over again.


After:


I decided to take a couple days off and drank 10-12 beers each day. I spent the day/night binge watching TV shows i hadn't seen in a while. 2-3 days turned into a week. A week turned into 3. 3 turned into a month+. Throughout this month I've barely worked any. I worked last weekend, made about $400 and thats it this month really. I started eating fast food everyday. I stopped showering everyday and brushing teeth. Wasn't that I didn't want to do those things, I'd just forget about them or deam them unimportant aince I wasn't really going anywhere or doing anything. I've gained 40lbs. I sit in my car for about 14+ hours a day either on social media, reddit, youtube, messaging people, or binge watching shows. I can feel my body has atrophied. I feel weak as hell. Whereas before I had plenty of energy, now I feel like a zombie all day everyday. My thinking is slow and easily distracted. I'm as slow as an old man (no offense to the elderly). I've been back to smoking a pack or more of ciggs a day. Drinking about 4 cups of coffee a day. Started taking kratom again and smoking weed at night when beer runs out. 


You need money to continue eating out, drinking heavily, and smoking. How did I get the money? Once my money had run out, instead of working like a normal person, I started pawning anything and everything I have of value. I'm at about $600 worth in the pawn now. Ironically, and to my detriment, I got approved for a credit card a week or two after I started my binge. $500 credit limit pretty much maxed out already. And now I'm behind on every single bill I have again. 


Why would I do this when everything was going fucking great? Why would I just burn down everything I just built up? This is not rational at all! I know the NA and AA folks will come out and say its part of the disease but I half believe you and don't. Yes there's an underlying problem that I evidently haven't seen yet but I'm one to believe that regardless of habits we are in control. Maybe I just felt like I had overcome all my problems and wanted more problems to solve again!? I don't know.


The moral of the story? 

Things can change rapidly. A few seemingly small choices can turn into a dominoe effect. Don't underestimate your ability to fuck things up for no good reason. Keep yourself in check and this won't happen to you.


Today is the start of my journey back to sobriety. In stead of drinking tonight I will be working. I have no choice. My car will be repoed very soon if I don't get back to business as usual. I'm only posting this so that people can see how fast your life can change, in both directions. I will use this thread to document the daily journey, as I've done before when I quit Phenibut. Adding a sense of accountability I guess. 


Just to note: I will not be going to NA or AA or any recovery meetings. I've done this alone before and can do it again. Arrogant or prideful maybe but it is to me a test of strength and character. Will I allow myself to fall deeper into the abyss or will I rise and take hold of my life again? I choose the latter.


Will check in everyday hereafter. Stay tuned.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9736813902854919}"

It's the overwhelming feeling I get when I cant help someone. Odd because I myself never ask for help and the only thing I can recall asking for help for was when I was at my worst and asked my wife to help me knowing she will probably leave me. I always said "" if I get better, it means I loose her and my kids."" She has never done a drug or smoked a cig. She hates drugs so you can understand me telling her that her husband is addicted to opiates what I'd be faced with. But I took the leap of faith and asked for help. Glad I did she has helped me tons. Anyway, my brain thrives off helping everyone. I was put in a mental institution when I was 17 (32 now) and my whole therapy sessions were why the fuck the world is the way it is. No one needs to starve. We have the means to help everyone in this world now. Why the fuck aren't we helping everyone for free? Now I get politics and money and everything else. But seriously fuck all that if everyone helped each other and everyone is different I know this is a huge task and will never come to light. But the resources are there and fucking money and politics and this I get mines fuck everyone else's mentality sickens me. So I turned to drugs weed and opiates made me forget this person I used to be. But deep down and now coming to surface that person again is coming out. It's too big a task to help all of you. But I'm here if you need me. I'm also only one person that can handle so much helping people before I break down when I cant help someone.

(I work nights so I should have been asleep), but I was feeling very worked up. I've been very happy lately, not taken my meds in a year, and just feel less hopeless. However, I was having a bad day that day and I had to get out, then I couldn't sleep, so I went into work on no sleep.

Within the first half an hour I was threatened by a customer saying he will smash my face in and find out where I live. Honestly it didn't even scare me and just made me laugh, but it did play on my mind as the day went on because nobody bothered to ask how I was and I am getting tired of being alone and having to deal with drunk and threatening, even harassing customers.

Anyway, I ended up having a mini breakdown on my break, and had a bit of a cry. I picked myself up again and got on with the rest of the day, but I was walking like a zombie, could barely string a sentence together, and felt like I would collapse (I hadn't eaten), then hometime came my Father came to pick me up, but as I was waiting for him I fell asleep in the canteen. I kind of forgot he was coming, which happens often (I have ADHD, diagnosed but unmedicated because of the possible addictiveness) I actually fell asleep for an entire hour, I must have been exhausted.

Needless to say my Dad was furious. All my family had tried to contact me and I was just out of it. I finally ran out and got into the car. He was so mad. Immediately he asked me if I was on drugs. I have had issues with prescription drugs in the past, and he believed I was back on them. He told me if I was then he was kicking me out. I was devastated. I cried and cried, and I barely cry. I was so angry with him for thinking that. I had been awake for 36 hours, I had just forgotten he was coming and had fallen asleep.

He says he is sorry for assuming but it seemed like I was, and of course I have forgiven him, but for him to think the worst has sent me into a kind of tailspin. I was so down today at work and I feel like they will always remember the person I was and not the person I am now. Last time he accused me I thought ""fuck it"" and took some. I am not that weak now but I do feel down and a little hopeless. Can I ever move on? Can they?

I just wish I never made that mistake, now I feel very sad again :( any advice?

TL;DR: Dad accused me of being on drugs because I fell asleep whilst he was picking me up from work, sent me into a bit of a tailspin because I have been clean for a long time and never touched any",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.99455726146698}"

I am not worried that I will use again in the near future. Rather, I worry that the drain of life’s perpetual emptiness combined with the ever growing grind of responsibility will eventually collapse my willpower and force me into a position where I am in too deep over my head. I know that taking on the responsibility of a burden is the only way for me to find deeper meaning in life - if life were a kid’s ride, we would grow bored quite quickly. Yet, I am challenged by my mental health setbacks in daily affairs that leave me unsatisfied, and attempting to climb higher melts the glue of my wings despite being so far below where the Icarus of my past tried touching the sun.

I feel useless. I found some meaning in picking up some trash today only to see a worker walking behind me using a tool to pick up what I was going to double back for after throwing out my handful of candy wrappers. I want to rise up and be a leader for this group that I attended today, but already I feel the crashing wave of performance anxiety dragging me down. There are opportunities where I could help someone, but I don’t realize it until after the fact and I kick myself for being so stupid that I can’t even do the simplest act of kindness without fucking up somehow.

I am angry. My father did this to me, with his rampant abuse and narcissism but I forgive him. This will lessen the anger in the future. By letting go of hot coals of vengeance that fueled my mental machine like black magick, I allow a peace to resume in my mind that I have not known since childhood. Even my oldest memories are scarred from being thrown across the room when I was four. It astounds me how I could think that I wasn’t abused for the longest period of my life.

I lived in denial for the longest time, mostly in regards to my gender identity. I actually tried to convince myself that I could stay clean simply on the basis that now I was starting to live as a woman I didn’t have all the internal stressors keeping me depressed. The regular feelings of having no purpose have changed my outlook on that. Now I feel it is impossible to escape the demons that haunt me from every shadowy corner of my world. 

Why am I staying clean? RIght now it’s to increase my chances of being housed. The programs to help the homeless grant more opportunities to those who show commitment to getting better. I want a better life, but I also see nothing I really want from the world. There is nothing which can touch this broken soul. I am alone and will be for the eternal future. You may read this and think otherwise, but I am on the farthest edge of the cultural bell curve being schizoaffective. I’m a bearded woman who talks to herself and has breakdowns regularly, even on my medication which robs me of some of my creativity. Hell, one med even stole my ability to enjoy my penis. 

What joy is there in life? I eat, that is my main addiction I am allowed to indulge in. I’m gaining weight. There is no reason for me to care. If I get fat, who am I driving away? No one will see me naked anyways. If I have a heart attack, who cares? Not even my family cares about me. I don’t know how to make friends being as odd as I am. No one wants to discuss the esoteric. A person at the group today even describe themselves as spiritual yet did not seem interested in me just bringing up the subject. I’m a displeasure in everyone’s eyes.

Hope. That’s what drove me for over three years now. I was so deluded believing the synchronicities. I seriously believed I was going to become famous. I don’t even want to be anymore. It’s as hollow as everything else in the world. Why be anything? I’ll just try and fail like everything I have ever done in life.

Soooo I've tried it today and FUCK ME WHAT A HORRIBLE MISTAKE. It's not at all like coffee or smokes. Its mind-altering potential for me is just like ""regular"" drugs and it scared the shit out of me. At first, I didn't feel anything special, but it started to rise after 15-20 minutes until shit finally kicked in after about half an hour after consumption. And it felt A LOT like stimulants I used to IV back in the days except for a lack of horrible withdrawal symptoms after the initial euphoric phase comes off. It made me make a really impulsive purchase and I have also immediately started to search for more of this stuff at the best price. I just felt like it took control of my mind just like drugs used to and I am really scared about how I'll feel in the next few days. I can really see how enough of this stuff could lead me to relapse. 

I think it's just past the border of what I consider to be safe and it's worth noting that I also supplement with nootropics like noopept or modafinil occasionally but these have never activated my addictive thinking like kava did.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977630376815796}"

Fuck that shit. 11/14/19.,"What started casual at parties has become a weekly binge. I drink to absolute blackout and secretly do coke in bathrooms, hiding addiction from my friends and gf. I’ve been managing to hold my job together, but just barely, and I honestly might get fired. If ever there was a wake up call, it’s right now, and I realized that I’m coming inches from losing everything I care about. Thought I had it under control but clearly not, and I just need to go cold turkey on this fucking hellish drug. Proud of myself for finally being able to admit it, first step of a long road, and loving the positive vibes you guys give each other. Looking forward to getting my life back on track, wish me luck.

UPDATE (11/18/19):

You guys are such a fucking awesome community, and this got so much more response than I expected, that I felt I owed y’all a mini status report.

Was still feeling like shit on Friday but made it to work, pretty sweaty/uncomfortable and bad anxiety. Friend invited me to the gym, every fiber of my being wanted to say no, which told me I should say yes, and I was feeling slightly better after. We had a chill dinner and called it early (normally I would have pushed to go drink until at LEAST midnight). And then that momentum just carried me through the weekend, I made it to swim practice for the first time in WEEKS and the first time ever not hungover, I had ONE glass of wine at dinner Saturday night like a normal human being, and I mostly chilled Sunday.

You guys were right, I’m still pretty lethargic/low energy which sucks, but holy SHIT it feels so good to be at work right now not struggling to just stay awake, nose running like a faucet, burning through a box of tissues blowing blood into every one. I almost slept through the night (only one slight anxiety attack) and this has been my most productive Monday so far in perhaps a year.

In the comments I tried to respond to people, some people were saying how much they related to what I wrote, and I just want you guys to know that you can take that step; it’s so much closer within your reach than you think. My journey is still in its infancy, and it’s gonna get harder before it gets easier, but I’m more excited about life than I have been in longer than I can remember. Anxiety and depression are a bitch, I also am an introverted extrovert, and coco helps me over that social anxiety to be a person that I want to be—but it’s a crutch, and one that comes with so much awful shit that I can’t believe it’s taken me over 3 years to see that something is wrong.

Yes, there are some variations but this is about how it goes every single day. There's about 16 hours in the day not counting sleeping. I waste about 14 of those hours doing absolutely nothing. 


This is how it goes:

I live in my car and I'm self employed. I wake up. Smoke a cigarette. Sit for a while on my phone until I have to use the bathroom. I go to the gas station, take care of business and get some coffee. Get outside smoke another cig. Take some kratom and gabapentin. Drink coffee. Go back to parking lot I stay at. Sit on social media or reddit for about 2 hours till I usual have to use bathroom again. Go to another gas station. Take care of business. Get more coffee. Leave gas station. Go to parking lot of gym I take a shower at. Sit in parking lot for another 2-3 hours, on phone and smoking ciggs constantly, till I have to use bathroom again. Get out and pack gym bag to go shower. Finish cigg. Take kratom. Grab gym bag and go take a shower. Use bathroom. Get ready to hop in shower. Everyday I pack bag, unpack bag, and get ready for shower exact same way. I shower everyday the exact same way. I find myself uaing the same exact movements in the same order everyday. Get out shower. Dress. Shave. Brush teeth. Go back to car. 


By this time it's around 5-7pm. I get depressed cause ive wasted the day away. And so sit there on my phone, social media, youtube, reddit, for about another hour or so. I leave with the intention of going and doing some work but I'm depressed and halfway om the drive to get started for work, I change course and head to the store. I get 6pack of 16oz beer and 2 24oz beers. Then, I haven't ate all day so I'll go get fast food somewhere. From there I go back to the parking lot I stay at, behind a furniture store, and drink, eat, and binge watch tv shows untill abput 4-5am. I'll smoke a bowl when I run out of alcohol and then either passout without trying to or I'll get in my van, lay down in my bed and go to sleep. 


I always plan to do things differently the next day but every day I get locked into this same exact pattern. I'm behind on all my bills. My debt is rising. I've been missing court dates for tickets I got over a year ago. I have gained about 40lbs in 3 months from eating fast food everyday and drinking instead of cooking. I feel like a zombie. Im numb and unmotivated. But I can't seem to escape this cycle.


Ive never been diagnosed with OCD or anything but I'll get into these very specific habit loops, not even including my addictions, just normal everyday behaviors, and it feels impossible to get out of this cycle. I only work when I absolutely have to. When I do work it seems to somewhat break the habit loop and I feel better but when I take a day off, I'm right back into it and not working for days again, doing the exact same thing everyday.

Telling him to be home at a certain time, worried if he’d stay out too late, finding drugs on him, etc. My mom was inclined to let him do what he wanted so he would stop bothering her. I hated that but she’s his mother right, not me. 

Last week we found out he’s smoking crack. I was floored. My mom went to be with him, since we live a few hours away. I haven’t talked to him because I want to do it in person and won’t be able to until this weekend.  

My mom hasn’t really talked to him about it. He was really really messed up when my dad found him. Is it wrong for me wanting for my parents to address the issue instead of acting like nothing happened? My mom keeps saying he’s been spending time with her since she’s been there but that doesn’t mean he’s all better. She also wants to rent an apartment to be close to him, while already having an apartment 4 hours away. So she’d be paying two rents. 

I think it’s better if he moves with her to get away from his friends and have a fresh start. My first preference would be he go to rehab.

I've got a mental illness that I'm really working hard on and making progress with but which sabotages my ass sometimes.

Anyway, I just started thinking about drinking tonight, and I know that I could get away with it. My husband works overnight, and all I would have to do is go buy a bottle and wait until he leaves for work. But I really DON'T want to do that. 

This is my first time admitting to anyone that I'm having an urge - usually it's just me admitting I drank, after the fact.  So, I'm just throwing that out there, I don't really know what else to say. Thank you very much for listening.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9966108202934265}"

I just wanted to write this for anyone considering quitting. And this is coming from someone who, about a month ago, never would have thought that I’d be abstaining from just about every chemical out there. 

I’ll try to keep this short, but basically I’ve been abusing alcohol and various kinds of drugs since the age of 16. Blackouts and doing dumb shit was all fair game over the last 14 years, and despite all the troubles it caused me, I never realized how damaging it was until I stopped it all. The contrast I’ve witnessed in just a short time is what inspired me to write this post. Hopefully it helps someone.

My opiate problem started when I was 18, after a knee surgery. It was true love at first buzz, but thank god I never had full access to it until the age of 25, which is right when things got a little out of control.. I was introduced to Oxy’s by a co-worker, which naturally blew percocets out of the water.. no more cold water extraction, just pure Oxy.. and the worst part.. I’m a functional addict.. so hitting rock bottom was more of an internal rock bottom. And that surely came..

This went on off and on for about 5 years, and thousands and thousands of dollars wasted on that dragon chasing ride.. I thought I was clever, hiding it from everyone, but the truth was, everyone knew.. they always find out after long enough.

Alcohol on the other hand was a constant. Never going more than a day or two without procuring a decent buzz. Foggy mornings became the norm, and a baseline feeling like shit was the status quo.

About 4 months ago I lost my job, which I wrote about a few months back - it was a super bullshit situation, which is when my usage of both alcohol and opiates sky rocketed.. more so than my normal usage of about 90-150mgs a day. I knew it was sky rocketing and that the problem was snow balling. So October 20th, 2019 I decided to stop the opiates once and for all.. no more “one last times” and “I’ll stop tomorrow” after I was already blasted.. it’s real easy to commit to stopping something when you’re high. But this time, something internally felt different. It felt for real this time.. 

Holy.. hell.. I’m sure people who have used heroin might have more horrific stories, but I went through the gnarliest withdrawals I’ve ever experienced.. hot, cold, back to hot, sweating, damn near shitting myself, throwing up, not eating, back to the blankets, turning on the fan & taking off the blanket, then freezing and putting them back on, racing thoughts, ANXIETY like you’d never believe, SO many cravings, and the worst.... the worst insomnia I’ve ever experienced.. although the worst of the physical symptoms subsided after about 3-4 days the insomnia went on for 12 days.. 12 hellish days that I will not forget.. my sleep still isn’t perfect.. but at least now it’s manageable.. 

And worse was the Booz I was chugging to make the symptoms go away, and they certainly did.. for about 2 hours.. which was then followed by the worst boomerang effect ever.. anxiety WORSE... insomnia.. WORSE.. depression.. WAY WORSE.. if you’re quitting opiates.. do yourself a favor and stay away from Booz.. seriously, it makes it worse.

Fast forward to November 4th, 2019 and there I was, hammered at 12pm, passed out by 2pm, and already hungover by 7pm.. I had enough.. I felt disgusted with myself and was sick of causing all this self induced pain. So I quit.. and just for good measure, I quit smoking too.

So here I am, 24 days sober of opiates and 9 days sober from alcohol and cigarettes, and if I’m honest.. really proud of it. I have never in my adult life gone more than 4 days without drinking, and all I can say is... I have genuinely never felt better in my life..

Everyone is different, and everyone’s journey to sobriety is unique, but all I can say is that for me, it took a deep internal DESIRE to stop this madness.. No one on this planet can convince you to stop but YOU.. has it been easy..? Fuck no.. some days is moment to moment.. but the cravings come.. and they predictably go, almost right on cue. But deep within my soul I am committed to putting an end to this problem, so despite me not being sober for THAT long... I know myself to know that I’m done with this shit.. Now I’m poised to face my demons with a sober mind that will undoubtedly take some callousing.. no more numbing unresolved problems.. 

Things that have helped me tremendously - meditation, running every morning, and cleaning up my diet. Personally, I do things to the extreme, so maybe you might like a more gradual approach.  But the point of this is... I feel SO MUCH better that I can’t even describe in words.. I am someone who struggled with constant depression and anxiety, and crippling social anxiety, and to my absolute amazement.. it is literally GONE.. I never realized how badly the vicious cycle was affecting all parts of my life. Here I was thinking it HELPED my social life, only to find it was killing it.

Any time I think of going back, I think back to the horrible, horrible withdrawals and all the times I justified using only to regret it immediately after. This has been key for me.. and when I have cravings, instead of white knuckle fighting them, I just acknowledge that they’re there and let them come and go like clouds in the sky.. easier said than done.. but every day gets just slightly easier.

So much for keeping this short, but if you’re trying to quit, just know that although it’s going to undoubtedly suck.. the other side is SO worth the pain and struggle.. 

It feels like life truly starts when you put down whatever numbing agent you’re attached to and finally face reality with a clean mind. But in my experience, that day doesn’t come without some serious internal conviction to stop.

If you’re struggling.. you got this!! WE got this.. cheers to all of you who can relate.

*Thank you all for the support and kind words! Truly means a lot to me*

And full disclosure... I just ran into an ex-co worker who is absolutely gorgeous.. and I was SO awkward.. something I used drugs and alcohol to mask.. so saying that was GONE was a little premature.. but now something to work on with a sober mind..

UPDATE: For everyone who sees this in the future, I’m still sober off both alcohol and opiates. 32 days off alcohol, 42 days off opiates :) Some days are harder than others.. but still going strong. We got this!",119,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9937637448310852}"

Looking for advice on how to discuss with boss and curious coworkers/friends,"Hello all. I wasn't really sure who to talk to about this that might have some experience so I figured it deserved my first reddit post. I have been using opiates consistently for a little over 5 years. Over the past two years I have been to a few IOP programs and periodically going to meetings but kept slipping back into my old habits. Even when I was sober I was compensating with other drugs. So I am finally committing to an inpatient treatment center and I am actually really excited/hopeful. The only thing I am really hung up on is how to handle communication with my boss and coworkers/friends. 

For reference I am 28yo and in a 100% commission technical sales position. I have already started my claim for FMLA/short term disability through a 3rd party that provides it and my manager will most likely be notified tomorrow so I am planning on requesting a meeting with him when I get to the office. My family has stated that I really shouldn't /don't need to disclose much and just say that I am taking disability and move on. I am not super close with my manager but he is a really nice/understanding person. I am okay with keeping the purpose for my leave totally private but part of me thinks he would appreciate a little honesty. Just being straight up and telling him that I have been struggling with drug use for a while and I am taking to leave to address it. I am not totally sure how he would react so I don't know if I should disclose that information. My performance at work has slipped a lot over the past two years and he may already know something is up. I also plan on quitting once I get out of rehab because my job is high stress and one of the main reasons I use but I would obviously like to handle this in the best way possible. What are your experiences with telling your managers that you are taking leave?

In addition I am also a little lost with what to tell my coworkers. I don't plan on full disclosure with them but I feel bad because I will be dumping a lot of work on their plates. It is really none of their business but people aren't stupid and they might be able to figure it out on their on anyway. Should I just let them be curious and move on? 

Lastly, my girlfriend has been totally supportive of this whole process but I know she is going to get a bunch of people asking where I am. Any suggestions on how we can get our story straight? I am going to tell some close friends but there are some people that just don't need to know.

Well, it has gotten to the point where I couldn't afford my addiction anymore, and for the last couple of months, I've been doing just the absolute bare minimum, every 6 hours or so, just so I wouldn't go into withdrawals. I tried going cold turkey a few times, but the responsibilities in my life made it impossible to stay off it long enough to withdraw. 
During this time, I watched my best friend's life fall to pieces bc of it. Her husband left and took the kids, she squatted in the house they were renting from his father until she was finally forced out, and during that time she stayed hooked and swore she didn't have a problem. (She had also been smoking crack, as well, towards the end.) She let her dealer and his girlfriend stay in the house with her, and was planning on moving in with them when they got kicked out, but instead she woke up one morning and they were gone, along with anything worth anything in that house. (They even stripped the copper wiring.) She ended up selling my washer and dryer, (which she swore to me I would get back less than a week before), and justified it in her mind that I owed it to her somehow, and went to a mental health facility, only bc she had nowhere else to go.   
Now, I'm sitting in a hotel room, bc I couldn't afford to go to a detox place,and I'm forcing myself through withdrawal just so I can get off of it for good.   
I'm scared. I hadn't told my SO, and broke it to him last night, and he's severely hurt, which is completely understandable, and he doesn't want to talk to me right now. Again, understandable, but I'm so worried that I'm gonna screw this up somehow, and I already fight major depression and anxiety and PTSD issues and the negative and suicidal thoughts are so damn loud right now, they're telling me I should just spend the last of my money on more heroin and just od here in the hotel room, no one would find me until Weds.....

I’m 27 years old and have grown up with a lot of trauma. I still love my childhood but experienced a lot of sexual abuse, then lost both my parents, my dad at 13 and my mum at 23.
I always just pushed through life and got through because I had too. Especially because my mother was unwell and I had to take care of her towards the end when she became palliative. 

Never facing my problems and pain I discovered after a surgery that I can numb my pain with drugs, oxy. 
I was prescribed opiates due to severe gynae issues but I abused them to cope. 
Especially after my mother passing I felt I was losing control over my life. Even though I was keeping it all together and worked a full time job (have a degree and a well paying job) I was simply not happy anymore. 

Dealing with my mothers death was so hard and because I had no parents anymore it was almost like I felt nothing mattered anymore. 
I wasn’t coping with ptsd with sexual abuse and for a good 2 years my addiction took over. 
I’ve never done hard drugs like heroin but prescription pills took over and I made some horrible choices to get rid of my pain. 
I have now been 9 months sober and I have no desire for the life of an addict anymore. 

Even though it helped it just made me not care about anything other than making myself feel better. 
Now that I am moving on with life, I am starting to discover all the shame I have about my past. 
I never noticed at the time how wrong my decisions were but now that I’m clear headed I simply can not forgive myself. 

I am so ashamed of my past that I’m really considering suicide (again).
I already attempted at the start of the year and landed myself in the psych ward for 1 month. 
I will never forgive myself. I know I’m not a bad person but I can’t change my past and I can’t deal with the guilt anymore. 
I don’t think it’s possible to forgive myself, it’s almost like I don’t want. 

I’m really thinking of committing suicide tonight.

How do I reverse this viscous cycle?","At this very moment, I am high on Percocet. It is the first time I have taken an opiate in one month. 

Not a long time for many, but for me, it was the longest I have ever gone without this substance. However, not one single day passed without an overwhelming desire to seek out more. I knew I would lapse the whole time. I did *not* feel any sense of accomplishment when I finally made it those 30 days. 

It’s an achievement for me to go more than a week without an opiate (no needles, I haven’t gone there and I wont). They have psychologically transformed a once charming, charismatic person to an emotionally numb, defensive, unsociable, irritable... addict. 

I’ve lost almost all of my friends because of them. I have been the cause of mass turmoil within my family. Had I not decided to move out when I did, my family would have surely spiraled into divorce and, consequentially, fragment an otherwise healthy family environment for my younger sister. 

I believed I was immune to addiction due to various reasons. So, when I was introduced to Roxy by a friend, my use of opiates increased every day, exponentially. When I ran out of money, my first experience of withdrawal occurred. For 5 days I felt as though I was going to die. 

I had to return to work after a week in bed sick. I asked my boss for more shifts, since I needed more money to support my addiction. My *entire* paychecks went to pills. Its an overwhelming cycle of working to purchase the substance, and purchasing the pills to keep working. Without them, i feel completely depressed, anxious, unmotivated, even manic at points, and it shows; my grades in school have suffered along with a “noticeable change in my character,” according to my coworkers and boss (who are all unaware of my addiction). 

I really can’t believe I’ve lived with it for as long as I have; my mother always tried to tell me they would either kill me or put me in prison. 

Well, none of those things have happened. I’m doing well educationally and am able to work >25 hours per week; I am in the process of building a small business. 

I can not exaggerate enough how difficult life has become since my introduction to this substance; in hindsight, I kick myself everyday for not realizing the terrible alternative to death or to prison was not solely to continue living, but to **stop feeling alive**. 

It’s awful to have to feel this way, and I will likely have to live with the psychological damage these have caused if I finally can quit.

I will continue to stifle this internal conflict of wants vs needs. I made it 1 month without for the first time in years, but impulsively lapsed a few days ago. My mind has completely transposed my personal wants and needs with the consumption  of a small but powerful pill.  

I just want to share a bit of my story with you guys because I do not have anyone in my life that would want to support me any longer. Plus, typing this all out is, my own opinion, healthy. I am going to try not to relapse, so tomorrow begins day 1 of a new attempt to tame my brain.

C&S since 1984, I went back to school again and again to dig into the title question. (Ten years worth, actually.) A modified point of view is always a possibility, of course. But at this point, my answer is, ""**It doesn't look that way**."" And here's why:

Those who are depressed, anxious and/or belief-bound seem to remain stuck in their unprocessed, undigested and undischarged neuroemotional energy needing *some* way to get off the not-so-merry-go-round the pros call the [**cycle of addiction**](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=cycle+of+addiction+wheel&qpvt=cycle+of+addiction+wheel&FORM=IGRE). Take away drugs. Take away alcohol, Take away food (or lack thereof). Take away risk. Take away sex & romance. Take away codependent relationship. Take away workaholism. Take away excessive exercise. Take away almost everything that can be used to temporarily masque off the icky *sensations* of [**Learned Helplessness, Dread & the Victim Identity**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/MadOver30/comments/clbtim/learned_helplessness_dread_the_victim_identity/), and one has just that: *Untreated* [Learned Helplessness & the Victim Identity](  https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/9dl6ra/learned_helplessness_the_victim_identity/?). (If interested, look up Martin Seligman, Edward Khantsian, George Koob, Harold Schaffer and Gabor Mate on that topic.)

A regular in AA and NA since 1983... and at least a semi-regular in [Al-anon](https://al-anon.org/) and [Nar-anon](https://www.nar-anon.org/) since 1986, in [CoDA](http://coda.org/) and [ACA](http://www.adultchildren.org/) since 1990, in [SLAA](https://slaafws.org/) since 1991, in [EA](http://emotionsanonymous.org/) since 2006, et al, et al, et al, as well as from a perch in several treatment facilities, I have been able to observe *thousands* of addicts in the long as well as short term. Along with the people named above, as well as those named or referred to below, I am fully convinced that addiction of one sort or another -- even if it is to ""righteous victimhood"" in the manner described by Richard Schwartz's ""obsessive protector"" (see the [Internal Family Systems Model]( https://www.google.com/search?q=internal+family+systems+model&oq=internal&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59l2j69i60j0l2.3346j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)) -- remains the No. One go-to for those who haven't digested and discharged something 80 percent of their reactive rage, existential fear, shame, guilt, worry, remorse, regret, morbid reflection. (Bill Wilson's articles in the *AA Grapevine* in the 1960s -- including those reprinted in the little book, *The Best of Bill* -- seem to me, at least, to strongly support this assertion.)

The millennial-era study of the neurobiology, neurochemistry and neurophysiology of depression and anxiety utilizing computer-aided tomography (CAT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and small-particle (SPECT) imaging have conclusively demonstrated that a) depression and anxiety have clearly identifiable ""images"" in the brain's limbic (emotion processing) system, as well as the [HPA Axis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal_axis) and its connections to the body's [autonomic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system). Anyone who understands all that and the operation of the [**Fight / Flight / Freeze / Faint / Feign (or Fawn) Responses**]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/b9x6wh/the_fight_flight_freeze_faint_feign_or_fawn/) that can lead to Fry and then Freak, can see the relevance to addictive ""defenses"" in a hot second. 

As a result, addiction professionals at such renowned, ""Class A"" clinics as Hazelden, Betty Ford, The Meadows and Sierra Tucson began to move recovering substance and behavior abusers into examining the *causes* of their addictions about 25 years ago. And began to bring on board people like those listed in the first paragraph of [this earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/71moyr/from_bipolar_to_borderline_to_complex_ptsd_the/). (Skip all the borderline personality disorder stuff unless it seems relevant, which, btw, it is for *many* substance and behavior abusers). 

Make no mistake: AA, NA, MA and all those other A's are still viable. In fact, the vast majority of addiction treatment professionals see them as *crucial* to recovery because they help to keep the as-yet-unfinished product of the *complete* recovery process away from the worst of his or her temporary, but ultimately worse than merely ineffective, emotional fixes. 

But, in 2019, it looks like the **limbic->-HPA axis->-autonomic ""gas bag"" has to be punctured and emptied** to put the nails in addiction's coffin. To that end -- and for those who remain interested after all this admittedly challenging edification -- may I offer sections 7a, 7b and 7c of that [same earlier post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/71moyr/from_bipolar_to_borderline_to_complex_ptsd_the/)? Because section seven rolls out a list of the most widely used and accepted methods to puncture that gas bag, including [Choiceless Awareness for Emotion Processing](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/07/choiceless-awareness-for-emotion.html).

I'm a 22 year old male with Asperger syndrome/high functioning autism. Just over four years ago, after seeing some of my online friends discussing it, I took up an interest in WWE/professional wrestling. For about a year or so I had a pretty typical and healthy interest in it as a hobby. Unfortunately after that, I started becoming increasingly attracted specifically to WWE's female wrestlers. I guess that wouldn't be bad in itself, but I started spending more and more time talking to other men online about how much we liked them- their matches and personalities as well, but a great deal of it was their looks. Their were a select few women that I grew especially fond of, and most of all their was Bayley, the most positive, fan friendly pure babyface they had back then. (If you're a wrestling fan happening to read this, this'll hopefully all make a lot more sense to you.)

I got annoyed and then bored of WWE shows and stopped watching them two years ago. I also was getting increasingly upset about live crowds and online fans no longer always cheering my favorite babyfaces, including Bayley, and not booing some of the heel characters; I couldn't understand either. But I was still extremely attracted to my favorite women and kept in the loop of the news as I was looking at their pictures and such. 

I heard about some of my favorite women turning heel; Sasha Banks, Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch; and how people didn't love them as nice babyfaces; and instead liked them as rude heels. People still didn't love Bayley, my favorite, who I had convinced myself ought to have universal appeal. Finally a few weeks ago they turned her heel too. The sweet fan friendly character I loved is gone and people love it, I feel utterly betrayed.

In my worst moments I freak out and have panic attacks; I even think about hurting myself though I've never acted on it. And yet I just can't stop thinking about her and looking into what's going on, even when it's going to hurt me.

2019-11-10 07:04:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/duan1v/adderall_benzo_addict_seeking_advice/,Adderall + benzo addict seeking advice.,"Life for me has been a constant search for stimulation. It has made me expert in certain areas that provided me with some stimulation and horrible at others. Ever since I was young I would get very sad whenever I felt bored. In my adult life this translated to major depression and really bad decisions when it comes to money and people just to stimulate myself in any way.   
 

To make a long story short: I fell in love at 20 years old and life was quite amazing, my stimulation(mentally) was over the roof but and I felt normal for the first time in my entire life. But as time went on she moved to study and as my stimulation went down the depression came, and it came hard. I was unstable and started to become manipulative, which I did not see at all so it ended and I was very, very confused.  
 

I went into therapy for 3 years but it never really helped and we tried several antidepressants. So my life continued to be plagued by bad decisions in order to get some stimulation. At 26 years old I randomly stumbled across an ADHD video and everything started to make sense. But at first I wanted to get diagnosed with ADHD in order to get drugs I could sell to spend money on fun items that gave me short term joy. To be honest I don’t know to this day if I do I really do have it, I learned to become a great manipulator over the years as sadly it’s given me stimulation to see what I can achieve with just changing the way I speak to people.

I went to a private psychiatrist and after looking through 200 pages of my school records and listening to my current and past life situation it was quite obvious to him I had ADHD(he is an expert in that area). I was given Adderall and I went on to sell it and continued to buy myself items that gave me short term joy. 

But one day I tried it and for the first time in many years I felt okay, but at the same time I also felt high, and I knew that day I am going to head down a dangerous path. But damn did it feel okay to not be haunted by racing thoughts for the next stimulant. I went back to school and scored A and almost every class. I felt I could be the person I actually wanted to be.   
 

I knew every subject by heart and with Adderall I loved what I once hated.  I would spend all my spare time help fellow students learn and enjoy classes. I made a whole bunch of friends and I could spend hours on end making them happy because I knew back in my head eventually the side effects would come, and most likely I would end up in a very bad state. Atleast i would have done something good i life.   
 

Now, as the time went on the high got lower, the dosage increased and so did the crashes. The crashes made me more depressed than I have ever felt so I added Xanax and clonazepam and I LOVED the feeling of not feeling anything. And thus my real drug addiction started. As time went on the benzos worked less so I added sleepy antidepressants and weed to knock me out.  
 

I would get high from 09:00-20:00 and take benzos + a mix at 20:00. Wake up 09:00 the next morning barely remembering anything from yesterday. Rinse and repeat. Now this works. I function well during the day and benzos + a mix removes me from this world when the crash comes and it’s great. But it’s also fucking not. The effects are getting less by the day and the dosages are increasing. 400mg caffeine, 200mg Adderall, 7,5mg benzos + either weed or sleeping medication on a daily basis.    
 

So I stopped. I quit cold turkey and I have been clean for 51 weeks. My effective work has gone down from 12 + hours to an hour a day. I no longer help students in my spare time and the ones I spent all my time helping never called me or decided to even ask what happened. My sleep is absolute shit and my mood is surprisingly neutral, but there is no real joy and about 2-3 hours of major emotional sadness a day. I spend most of my time just wandering around with racing thoughts.   
 

It’s been almost a year and I returned to the old me. A hunt for stimuli and bad decision with money for short term joy, the difference now is that the joy is shorter and the depression periods are longer. So what if I just took a low dose of Adderall? I crash from even low dosages and Adderall just makes half of the day good and half of the day more shit then it already was if I don’t abuse some drug to combat the crash.  So it’s more or less the same, just a different mix.    
 

Any tips as to where to go from here? I don’t get stimuli from much anymore. The only real stimuli I can get is when I’m with someone I love but that has not happened for 10 years and last time I saw the dangers that that came with. The constant hunger for Adderall + benzos is there every day just to feel okay.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9836347103118896}"

I was a high functioning addict until the last couple of months. Held a job and was always the one to make everyone around me have fun. 

I won’t be drinking tonight obviously because I don’t want to fall back in bad habits. I’m just worried about being a different person in front of people who I’ve known all my life. My anxiety is obviously higher than before, it was non existent.  But I’m going to give it my best. Wish me luck reddit!

Part keeping myself busy, part looking for support and advice, part putting myself out there to help others. Sorry if it isn’t cohesive and flowing well. 

I’ve been a long time on and off user of opioids for pain. All prescribed by a doctor and never once prescribed by lying or when I didn’t actually have “a problem”.  I have chronic pain issues, I have severe arthritis. I first tried Percocet after knee surgery five years ago and the usual it was magic etc but I never went beyond the prescription. I would actually just take a few of them on a Friday night to truly relax, my knee hurt a lot but was manageable however with these pills I could really really relax and enjoy my night. 

Prior to this I had never even tried shrooms until I was 34. 

I met a guy earlier this year, we went to a party and the boys wanted some coke and he organized it. He’s a cool guy and we actually have ended up doing some business together (legit business) and one day it just hit me I was like hey man can your guy get Percocet? He said yep what you after? I wasn’t actually sure so I said get some pricing. I was on a mid size dose from my doctor at the time but it wasn’t cutting it so i wanted to top it off “for emergencies or the occasional night of pain”. I got my first amount and it was great popped a couple in celebration and had a relaxing night. I actually told my friend don’t get me anymore until x date which was a month away. 

10 days later a generous months supply was gone and I told my buddy I lost some so help me out. He did and then said he wouldn’t do anymore after that for the month. I ran out early again and called him and he put up a fight but I was addicted and withdrawing bad so he just put me in touch with the contact directly. I’m not blaming him, I’m my own man and he has never taken these things but I wish to god he had held fast and let me suffer it out because I don’t think it would be too bad at that stage. I needed the pills for my pain (the legit ones)  but when you have a 50 supply next to it to top up it takes not time at all for it to be a huge problem. Im not seeking highs to be honest. I love the silence they bring to my mind but I genuinely need them for pain but I did not need these extras and now I’m hooked and the withdrawals are so terrifying. 

I’m now at a high bottom. I have money, a beautiful family and a successful business. But I know I’ve fallen from the top and I’m stuck on a ledge just below it. I need to climb back up but slipping from here could be so easy. I’m SOO fucking disappointed in myself, I never thought I would be like this. I’m so empathetic to anyone who suffers from addiction but myself. I could meet 1000 people with addiction issues and I could give love to all of them. I’m so mean to myself. I CANT fucking believe how stupid I am for being (apparently) such a smart guy. I understand addiction is not a measure of intelligence and I don’t mean offense by that but that’s the sort of mental torture I put on myself. I also don’t want to bother anyone. My wife has taken the kids for the weekend and I should be loving life but I’m just trying to survive and withdraw my way back to my regular dose. 

I have to tell my wife on Monday that I was using illegal drugs, part of me wants to be the victim and only get support from her but I know I have to let her be disappointed also. 

I’m so fucking lucky, I can afford a lot of things to entertain myself during this time. I can go do things most folks can’t which is everything when dealing with stress of any sort. I want to see the positive in the fact that I so far have managed to recognize this by myself and have admitted to 4 trusted people who have banded together to make a roster of checking in on me. One of my employees who is like a
Brother to me and I love him dearly has taken my
Pills and is giving me daily doses so I can’t just take whatever I want and deal with the consequences later. I’m so lucky. 

I love all of you struggling out there. You’re all worth so much more than you realize. I have nothing left in my life right now that enduring this. I’m such a mess

I’ve got this problem, until 3 month ago I lived with a friend as roomies. We both smoked weed, drank and did speed a lot. I’m sober since febuary but he isn’t, he found himself a drug-dealer girlfriend awhile ago that he now lives with and supplies him with stuff. 

She interduced him to acid, coke and Molly that they’ve done several times (no addiction that I could see). He smoked weed every day for the last year I lived there and haven’t stopped since I moved out. 

My friends and I have seen some personality changes in him the last 1 1/2 year. He’s become more irritated, less helping to others, he can be kinda mean sometimes, less social and overall a become less fun to be around. This have resulted in a kind of isolation for him since sober people don’t want to be around him that much. 

My question is what can we do? He’s not a self-reflecting guy by nature and the drugs make it worse so I’m afraid he’d get defencive or/and mad if we talk about his drug-use. But he needs to stop since it’s a negative influence on his life and personality. I’m actually kinda scared for his well-being and could really need some help.

My first addiction was porn. When i was a teenager i was so addicted to porn. I was the one hacking porn sites and sharing them with my friends. Masturbating 10 times a day etc. Then i got addicted to gaming, then the internet. 

As i grew older i got addicted to gambling and then sex and prostitutes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Recently i had my first serious relationship. Unfortunately my addictive brain took over. I became addicted to the sex with her. All i could think about was the sex. I constantly wanted to fuck her. The best part of the week was when she would come over to have sex. The anticipation was the best. I don't think i ever truly loved her. She eventually ended things with me . Fair enough. But i reacted so badly when we broke up because it was like my weekly drug and high was getting taken away. 

&#x200B;

It's been 5 months since this happened. In the first months after the break up i'd sometimes drive to her gym. The ANTICIPATION of potentially seeing her made me feel euphoric. It was like cumming. I almost became addicted to that feeling. Sometimes i'd drive past her house. That thril seeking/risky behaviour adrenaline was so addictive. Checking her soical media was just a bad. 

&#x200B;

Fortunately i stopped all these things.

i'm in a better headspace at the moment. I no longer feel so addicted. But i think it's clear that my brain chemistry isn't right. I' m kind of worried that my next relationship might be like this.

&#x200B;

Is this something i just have to be weary of and live with? i'm kind of worried to ever have another relationship. It was like pure extacy for me.  I had never felt such a high. It was so addictive.

Psychological pain.

Now I have true muscle pain.  In my back and abs. From PTSD and a small injury that maybe twisted my body a bit? Threw everything off, while I was in PTSD trauma.

Now it is 10 beers a day average.  7-13 it seems.  I can’t afford or do it anymore.  10 months with like 30 days off mixed up.  I keep getting sober a few days.  I drink mostly 4PM to 1AM. Not 24/7. But I am I in so much pain.  I can’t stand or sit or lie down. I can walk ok mostly.  And I walked to much and hurt my knee which through my already tense tight back off. My hips.. my abs.  

In a few months it snowballed.  

I need to stop drinking right now.  I have CBD herb that I vape.  I don’t like to use pain relievers. But I have several.  And Robaxecet.  I don’t use any unless I am not drinking.   

I am in agonizing pain.  I really try to ignore by drinking.  But I drink almost daily in trauma.  So so can’t start stretching of even deeply massaging myself.  Because it brings more pain.  

It is this cycle of insanity.  Trying to heal myself and get off beer. And I am in so much pain by the 2nd and 3rd day I can’t sleep.  

I feel like if I start the momentum the other way I can stop drinking.  I don’t want pills.  

What mental ways can you meditate or something to not be in pain?  

And quit smoking too?  I can’t even afford to drink or smoke anymore. And I can’t stop.  Either causes both withdrawal, and more actual pain.  

I need to find a way to get through 5 days of alcohol and nicotine withdrawal, while being in really the worst pain of my life almost all the time.  Never, ever comfortable.  

And I am in a city where I know no one.  And finally exhausted the last weeks after 2 years of PTSD trauma where I lost 60 lbs.  I am so tired and so sore and so never comfortable.

And I need to kick beer (fine... pain)... and cigarettes... all nicotine but 40 nicotine mints.  

I have no choice.  I need to find some mindful way to get out of my own head and body.  

How do you deal with withdrawal and pain?  

I need water.  To eat better.  Walk my dog.   I can’t Calm down to focus. I lie down or sit.  But I can’t calm my mind or myself. My body is so tired.  But I can’t calm my mind without alcohol.  And my body is using it like opiates to calm my back pain.  So it makes it worse because I sit or lie wrong and make it worse. But now.., everything makes it worse

I am not whining.  Not self pity.  Writing this I am remembering a lot of things I can do or have done.  To calm down.

I can’t spend $30 a day on cigarettes and beer.  I can spend $8 on weed.  If I stop spending any other money.

But physically I can’t take it any more.  

Tomorrow so wake up.  Make eggs right away and drink a bunch of water. And that’s it.  

Just deal.  Find a way.  Can I do that.  44.  I did it before with alcohol for long periods.  Cigarettes no.  And everything but mints or gum makes me hypomanic.  Worse than cigarettes.  So cold turkey or almost.  25 years.

I want to call it ‘hyper consumption’ ..,"\- a short back story - I had smoked flower for two years quite heavily and the last year or so I converted to dabbing. I converted to wax because it is nearly odorless, the affects are immediate, and the euphoria is intense. I  live with my parents so my method needs to be discrete. 

I recently went on vacation with family and I cold turkied it for 2 weeks! My longest streak in my 2 year + career. I continued my sobriety at home for another week for a total of 22 days. I honestly feel like I woke up; my mind was clearer and quicker, my libido was greater, my sleep was improved, my mood was more consistent. Then I had one rough night and decided to ruin all of my progress and to continue with it until today. It's now been 42 days of constant consumption. I want to call it “Hyper Consumption”. One of my weaknesses was the dab pen. I invested in a rig so i could venture away from the pen - because of how fucking convenient the pen is. In my pocket I had instant access to being close to 10/10 high because I live here in a legal state, I get the good shit. Eventually I would have to buy cartridges closer to twice a week rather than once every two weeks. Honestly Ive began to alternate between my rig and the pen. 

Im smoking so much to avoid a few things I have been avoiding for some years now. I know what they are. I know I’m avoiding the withdrawal symptoms. I know I'm avoiding the people I have to apologize to eventually. I fucked up some classes in school and I do not want to go near the unsightly ruin that Ive turned my credit into.  

I just needed to say that this last month an a half I have erased all the progress I could have done while I was gone. Essentially I have reverted to my old ways of frying my brain. Im dabbing a gram every 2-3 days. I burn my entire paycheck days after receiving it and I can’t pay off my credit card. Now I feel things change in my health; My throat is crazy sore, my kidneys in my back get sore, my memory is shot, and I pee very abnormally. Sometimes I'll have strong urges to pee, ones I can’t fight, but when i get to it only a small amount comes out. Other times I'll dump a huge amount of very clear, almost green pee. 

I need to find a new, different way of releasing dopamine within me ol noodle. A few things I know I can do include picking up acrylic painting again, learning oil painting, learning skateboarding again, pursuing photography again, and drawing in the dozens of empty books I have laying around. My problem is I dont go about getting started doing those things. Its like I dont care about getting better even though I have the tools to do so.

I'm not sure if I am in the right place.  My adult brother has been an alcoholic his whole life. He is in major denial. He has quit several times for a few months but always goes back to drinking. We have a long history of alcoholism in our family but he looks it at like he doesn’t have a problem with his drinking everyone else has one. He is very selfish when it comes to this kind of stuff. A typical addict. A few years ago he was caught doing cocaine. Said it was a casual thing and had stopped. Here’s the thing though, his drinking and cocaine use is not a party thing. He is doing coke in the garage and going back into the house to hang out with his family. He never goes clubbing or to bars he is always alone and at home when he drinks and does coke. That to me is a major problem.  

Before summer began we had a family bbq and apparently he was doing coke in the garage while our family was over. He left a razor blade and residue on the table in the garage. I’m not sure who else saw it but I definitely did. I confronted him the next day and he confessed to his wife that he needed help. I sort of felt like it was a cry for help because he left all his stuff out but he quit drinking and snorting the next day and had a great clean summer. 

As addicts do, he relapsed and started drinking again as soon as summer ended and for the past month I am finding white residue in the garage again (we smoke cigarettes in there and its kind of a man cave so it is a common place to go). He’s obviously addicted again but my question is do I confront him or do I address this with his wife? The last time he was caught he told her on his own after I confronted him. She thought he came to her but I told him if he didn’t tell her I would. He really had no choice. This time around I don’t know what to do. He needs help and needs to go to rehab. As far as I know he has been addicted to coke for about 3 years now. When he gets caught he quits but picks back up after a few months. He has three children. My brother is around them when he is high and drunk. These children are all I care about at this point. If my brother wants to ruin his entire life that is his choice but I need to protect the children. I grew up with an addict mother and I want to protect them from that.

His wife is obviously in denial because I don’t understand how she can’t see what is going on. We were talking about his drinking relapse a little over a month ago and I said I think he may be doing coke again and she said he better not be, that’s a deal breaker but he obviously has been and her denial won’t let her see it or she just doesn’t want to face it. I want my brother to get help. I want him to be there for his children. I don’t want him to have the same life our mom had. Two of his best friends have died in the last three years from drug problems. I see the pain their families go through and I will do anything to prevent that pain on my family.

I’m torn with this being none of my business and giving up on him entirely. My brother and I are under a year apart, we have always been close. I have been best friends with his wife since we were teenagers and I am very close with his children. We have the same friend circle so there is really nobody I can talk to about this without ratting my brother out. We are a small but tight family and we share a two-family house. I want to confront my brother but he will deny it, brush me off and become sneakier about his habit. I want to confront my sister-in-law but she is in major denial. I’m afraid if I tell her she will just kick him out and he will go on a downward spiral. I’m afraid if I confront him he’ll kill himself or something to not have to face it.

So, I had a pretty bad recreational drug habit. Ever since senior year of highschool I have been a polly drug user. I often used drugs just to get through my day. I was a fairly functional drug user and managed to control my depression during this time. Anytime I was sad I did enough drugs to feel normal again.

Fast forward to 3 months ago and I was using hard drugs like opiates multiple times a week and had picked up a few prescription stimulant habits. I Also used nicotine daily at high doses.

eventually there were unpleasant side effects and withdrawals. I decided I couldn't maintain my habits anymore. The hardest part was craving drugs everyday just to function. I did not want to live like that anymore.

I slowed down my drug use and eventually went completely drug free. I am glad I am sober, but I have a hard time managing the crippling depression and suicidal thoughts. I can no longer use drugs to cover up these feeling.

After being one month sober, things have gotten slightly better. I don't feel terrible everyday due to withdrawals and I don't crave drugs nearly as much. Slowly, the fog has lifted and my brain is functioning better. Now I have to face everything I was unable to do while I was depressed and withdrawing and it's overwhelming.

The hardest part for me is getting up in the morning. I used to rely on stimulants to do this. Most days I lay in bed and I'm not willing to get out until 10:00 or 11:00. This is a problem because I have classes at 9:30 every day.

In the morning I am like a different person. I don't want to face my day, I just want to lay in bed and slip back into the blissful comfort of non existence. I could care less if deadlines are met or if anything gets done at all. I just want to sleep.

I want to get better, I hate the way I feel most days. Its not worth it for me to live a the rest of my life depressed. I know I need to make changes eventually, or I might as well kill myself now.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9747856855392456}"

2019-11-06 12:07:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/dsj9kn/i_accidentally_got_addicted_to_klonopin/,I accidentally got addicted to Klonopin,"Off and on for the last couple of years I've had active klonopin prescriptions for anxiety/public speaking (as a graduate of Architecture school I chose a hell of a career path for someone with stage fright). By off and on I mean very rarely, I never took it for more than a couple days in a row and I never took a high dose, always 1mg/day or less.

A couple of months ago I was a groomsman at the wedding of one of my best friends. The day went fine for the most part until after the fact when I had a 6 minute grand mal seizure out of nowhere - never had any kind of epilepsy before. I guess I ruined picture time pretty good.

I was at the ER when they asked what they think might have caused it. I told them that I've been under a lot of stress lately with grad school applications and work and job interviews, I was probably dehydrated and overcaffienated as I had been standing up and busy all day. I was just starting to develop a fever as I would spend the next week with a bad head cold. I had been having increasing allergy issues that day because of the very real rose I was wearing on my coat that I was very much allergic to. I was sleep deprived from the previous night, etc. I finally told them that I occasionally used klonopin for anxious situations.

The ER doctor acted as though nothing else I had said meant anything anymore. It was the klonopin and nothing else, no doubt. Suddenly instead of taking it once every few days irregularly I was now taking a higher dose every day at the exact same time (basically the opposite of how you're supposed to take it) as per the instruction of the doctor at the ER. I did not have any other withdrawal symptoms at the time of the seizure since I was not in withdrawal. However it took a long time before I could get appointments and tests done with a neurologist and a psychiatrist - by this time I had been taking klonopin long enough that withdrawal would be unavoidable by the time I was able to stop taking the medication.

My MRI and EEG came back perfectly normal, and I was told to taper my dose for a week and then stop. Withdrawal from klonopin has been easily the worst experience of my life. Just in the last two weeks I've felt as though I've been in a dream, I've had the most pounding headache, I've been dissociated, I've had shakes and muscle twitching and insomnia from stopping my small dose (1/2 per day). I've been feeling so nauseous that I can't eat, and then not eating makes me nauseous. I've lost about 10 pounds in the last two weeks. I've had varying degrees of double vision, blind spots and bright dots, and it feels like my sight is ""delayed"" or at least running at a very low framerate.

Finally I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel. My  ""moments of clarity"" are getting more often and more intense (never thought I'd describe feeling normal as ""intense""). I knew that this could have been much worse if I had been taking a higher dose. I took my GRE when this was at its worst, and I have a job interview tomorrow so I'm hoping I feel a little better tomorrow. I've been slowly feeling better every day the last few days. My eyes are less bloodshot and gray and the shakes are going away. My appetite is slowly returning.

Basically I'm just angry that the ER doctor didn't take anything else into account  besides the fact that I occasionally take klonopin. I'm angry that I wasn't allowed to stop until I had been developing a dependence to it for 7 weeks. I'm angry that this happened right as I am trying to take my GRE and having job interviews. I'm angry that my wife doesn't believe me about how bad this is. I'm angry that I had to miss so much of my current job because the klonopin made me feel like a zombie and the withdrawal made me feel like a dreaming zombie with a migraine. I'm angry that the ER doctor jumped to conclusions and got me addicted to one of the most dangerous substances to ever be addicted to.

_________________
In fact, a lot of people told me not to drink caffeine as it can make benzo withdrawal worse. I'm finally to the point where my caffeine withdrawal is almost as bad as my benzo withdrawal.

Wish me luck tomorrow at my job interview, I'm hoping that I finally can get a real architecture job and not be fixing bicycles for the rest of my life.

If anyone else ever ends up in the ER for a first seizure, please please please take it on the chin (of course get all the appropriate tests and imaging done ASAP though) and try to argue yourself out of a klonopin addiction. At this point I'd rather take another seizure than the withdrawal I just went through/am currently going through.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990824460983276}"

I've been in therapy for a while and I never really know if I'm an addict, but I was influenced by /u/lonergirl420 's post about ""16 and cigarettes"" and I was wondering whether my behavior constitutes addiction and if so, how in the damn hell I can beat it.

&#x200B;

I'm so glad I can be honest here, I don't ever talk about this on my main but: I used to abuse Ritalin and Adderall a lot last semester, snorting and taking pills until I hit 95mg in 6 hours and ended up laying on a bed for 2 hours near-hallucinating. I stopped those, but I'm taking vyvanse now and while I don't abuse it, I don't know how I'd live without it.

&#x200B;

I don't excessively crave alcohol, but when I get some I drink it until it's gone. I went through a bottle of vodka, a 12-pack of Whiteclaw and a 375ml of Fireball in 5 days by myself, and this is improved drinking. I've been logging my drinks since last year and over the summer I had 150 standard size drinks in a month. I guess my drinking confuses me because I know of some people who think 9 drinks in a night is ""light drinking"" and I don't know if my level of drinking constitutes a problem. 




I also love Ativan (benzos) and if I have my bottle on me I'll pop a few a night, but I can't get any more refills because I switched doctors on purpose and I want to keep it that way. I haven't really craved them any more.

&#x200B;

In addition, I've been vaping for a year and have tried to quit countless times but now haven't been able to stop smoking cigarettes for a month. I've tried time and time again, but each time the Vyvanse hits I get saddled with horrible cravings and just end up smoking again. They say you would walk a mile for a Camel: no joke, I have spent hours trying to get cigarettes or vape, neglected homework, and generally moved heaven and earth and pissed off quite a few friends trying to get a nicotine fix. That's unquestionably addiction, I know it.

I feel like I'm tied to these substances, I've had a horrible cough for months now and I just know that my drinking, smoking and stimulant use is going to do me in, but I just don't know how I can quit it and even if I'm addicted to stims or alcohol.

I made the decision to come clean to my wife about what was actually wrong with me. I hid my use very well. We work opposite schedules so it wasnt to hard. She was understanding because it all made sense. All the times I was ""sick"" were withdrawls. All the mood swings about anything and everything for me not getting my way. It was all because of my opiate use. But I made it 11 days and going to make it one more day and then another. I'm determined to stay clean and I'm being open and honest about everything. Every feeling, every mood I talk through it with my wife. Shes amazing. Shes never done drugs. Shes who I wish I was. I know it will take time to repair what I damaged within her and she deserves to have that repaired. I'm trying my hardest to keep busy with kids and everything. I've ate so much food this past week and been out and about outside and cleaning my house up and down. Keeping busy is my problem. Boredom makes me want to use.

I’ve had some pretty devastating trauma earlier in life, and weed has always been there for me. Therapists didn’t work, group talk sessions didn’t work, and simply quitting cold turkey never ever worked. Weed has always been my go to therapy and has never turned its back on me. But now, I have a family, a house, bills, work, etc. Sometimes I catch myself spending money on weed when I absolutely do not have the means to spend it. I find it so hard to be disciplined enough to stop myself from buying it. It has affected my relationship with my girlfriend (the mother of my 3 kids), it has affected my job, and mainly, it has affected my relationship with my kids. I love my children more than anything, and anyone that knows me will tell you that I’m an amazing father. But weed just has a monstrous grip on my mental and physical health. I literally feel like I can’t quit. I can quit for a job, or quit just to quit for a few months, but it seems like that entire period of quitting, all I’m thinking about is when it’s okay t smoke again. Then the weed grips me again. I want to quit so bad, but then again I don’t in fear of the person I am without it. I lost my mother to suicide at 15, and I have been almost a daily smoker since then. I am now 26. It’s time to stop. But I feel like I’m trapped in a weed room with no windows or doors. How did you overcome your “addiction” to weed? How did things change months or years down the road? Do you regret ever starting to smoke? Or do you regret ever quitting? What advice would you give to someone like me who feels trapped with no way out?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9834730625152588}"

I have a somewhat avoidant and socially anxious personality and I realized I won't ever figure things out and get as focused as I want to be if I continue to literally waste hours of my day on my phone. There's so much I want to learn still and I want to overcome depression and get more focused, but that's not gonna work if I keep  running from issues by simply acting like I am busy on my phone cycling through the same apps over and over again or wasting time in chat rooms.

So I came up with a challenge for myself:  
Starting today, I won't use my phone for a week, unless it is absolutely necessary that I have to. I was actually afraid before, but so far it was surprisingly easy and actually a positive experience. I feel more focused already, I don't reach for my phone every 5 minutes at work and it's a lot easier staying in the present morning. I feel better than on most days at work despite the fact that I got no sleep Saturday to Sunday and only 4 hours Sunday to Monday.

I tried to come up with specific rules for myself:

* I am not allowed to use my phone, unless it is absolutely necessary
   * Necessary cases: I need to call my doctor for an appointment this friday, if I am in danger for some reason or this morning I needed to check if my friend can take me to work as he sometimes can and sometimes can't (he can not for the rest of the week so this was a 1-time check)
* As I am not addicted to social media, I am still allowed to use them on desktop devices. I checked my facebook notifications quickly only 1 time so far and my messenger app also once on desktop, which is a great statistic
* I am allowed to listen to music on the train or at the gym if my phone is in flight mode and I turn off the screen as soon as I selected an album or playlist I want to listen to
* I am allowed to answer calls. In order to not feel isolated or lose friends. I hardly ever make or get calls, but if there is a lofical reason to (like calling my doctor), I am allowed to do that.
* I work in e commerce and sometimes I need to test stuff on my phone on the mobile page. I am allowed to do that, but it does not seem like there is any need to do so this week.  


Positive behavioral changes I noticed already:

* I slack off less at work
* I actually (try to) talk to my peers
* I feel less stressed out and more ""in the present""
* I literally saved at least half an hour off my phone already
* I somehow feel less depressed, might just be a good day though
* Somehow, I have less of an urge to drink alcohol, which puzzles me
* I actually do things that I think are unpleasant (like calling my doctor, I hate calls or initiating conversation)

Things I expect/want to happen:

* Spend more time on my free time projects
* Get more focused
* Don't do things half assed and actually build up skill
* Get more social
* Get less aggressive towards others
* Deal with my projects
* Keep staying in the present
* Deal with negative thoughts of loneliness at home instead of distracting myself from them
* Find out what I actually want to do in life
* Get more creative
* Like myself more

I'm not sure if it would be addiction or not, I don't know what else to call it.  I don't know what to do anymore and I feel lost.  I don't have a problem with weed, I smoke myself and don't have a problem with my boyfriend smoking either.  The problem is how it's affecting him:

We have been together for about 2 years and it started out as any relationship, everything was good.  He was present in the relationship, we were there for each other on the bad days, we listened, and we were happy.  After a short while, he stopped going to work because he felt uncomfortable at work, he said he didn't like it and I started helping him find another job.  We stopped hanging out as much after this because he couldn't afford to go out anymore and I told him that it's okay that I got us and that we don't have to do things that cost money, I never made him feel as if he had to always pay for everything.  We always take turns. After some time he started a new job, which was a tough process but I helped him, and his friends and family helped him.  He stopped smoking for couple of months but had horrible nightmares and was constantly agitated. I stuck by his side through it all even on days he wanted to give up hope, I held on to hope for him for the both of us.  He stopped going to his new job because he just wants to stay home, play video games and get high. He told me that when he gets high, it feels okay to just sit there alone, he doesn't want to be around anyone, it doesn't matter who they are, it all feels okay. He doesn't have the desire to have sex, he doesn't even touch me anymore.  He doesn't have the desire to do anything he used to.  He has told me that he doesn't want to live like this, like he wants to go out and do the things he used to. He wants to go to work and have money to go on trips and stuff. It's frustrating to see that he wants to do these things but yet doesn't take steps to try to get out of this hole he's in even though he has the support.  He used to know how to comfort me when I had a bad day and now he tells me that he doesn't know how to.  He didn't  like seeing me cry and now he makes it seem like he could care less. I'm not saying that he doesn't care, he just makes it seem like that.  I tried to play video games with him just to spend time with him and the entire time it felt like he just wanted me to leave soo eventually I gave up and left him alone.  I tried to give him space and he tells me that he doesn't want that, he tells me that he wants me in his life but his actions contradict everything he says.  I try to help him take baby steps, anytime he does something that takes him out of his house I tell him that he's doing good, doesn't matter how small something is that he does, I almost always try to give him positive reassurance.  I can see it in his eyes that he doesn't want to live like this but maybe he isn't ready to fight hard enough to get out yet.  But I'm losing myself trying to help him, I feel alone all the time, and anything I do is not enough.  My feelings, emotions, and experiences are constantly invalidated.  I don't want to give up on him because this guy that he has become is not him and he has expressed that he wants to get out of this state and he tries.  He tries but it's like he takes two steps forward and then three steps back and it feels like we are back to where we started. 

Can anyone that has gone through this or something similar give advice that helped you get out of that hole with weed?  Weed doesn't affect me the same way it does my boyfriend, I smoke everyday after work and I get high and study.

However, over the last year, I have become a fully fledged cocaine addict. I use at least a gram a day. I have blown all of my savings, maxed out my credit cards, and taken out high interest personal loans to buy more drugs. I have isolated myself from friends and family as I am ashamed to be seen so strung out. I am afraid I will be alone forever as every date turns bad as the person realizes there is something wrong with me.  I am barely holding on at work, making up fake meetings to cover the fact that I am coming in late due to being up all night coked out. I feel like I’m on the edge of being found out by my work and roommates and losing everything. I have written a will that I have ready to send out if I feel like I’m overdosing or ready to kill myself. 

I am ready to quit this completely. I don’t enjoy this at all anymore; I do coke and then lie in my bed waiting for it to wear off. I have insurance for now and have seen an addiction specialist that has put me on gabapentin and Prozac for the initial withdrawal. I am not in a position to go to rehab practically.

 I am just wanting to know there is still hope to turn this around. I assume many people have to go cold turkey while still working and existing in an environment that is triggering because they don’t have money to get away right away. How did you make yourself stop in the initial days? What helped you keep yourself accountable? What helped you physically and mentally?

i've an addiction. it's betting. i've been betting for nearly four years now. and i'm 22. 

i really don't know why i'm betting. yes, money has a great charm, but that's not the issue. i gamble even if i have huge amount of money (for a student, of course). yes, i'm studying. i also work home office and make great money. but i lost all of my payment in 'two hours'. everytime i lose a bet, i become more sucidial. i don't think that i'll do that, but it makes me feel like a dead person. i cry, i yell, i sweat a lot. it's like a panic attack. but i cannot stop. i lose all of my money. every month. i just cannot stop.

as i said before, it's not about money. even if i win huge amount of money, i cannot satisfy myself. i keep going no matter what. and eventually, i lose. that's pretty much every single day for four years. i'm sick and tired of this. but i cannot escape. 

i'm living with my family. their finance is not great, so they often ask help from me. i have no problem about giving them money. but since i started gambling, i cannot do that. because i do not have money. i cannot go outside. i cannot pay neccessary things about my school, daily life etc. i just keep betting. i do not know how i can get rid of this. 

half an hour ago i lost all of my salary again. and i got my salary two days ago. now, for all the month, i'll be all broke. but i know that next month will be exactly same. i'm scared. i feel terrible. i started to develop anxiety for four years. and it's getting crazier each day.

sometimes, i look around of myself. some of my friends live at their own place, have great lives and spend their money on things they actually care. i really don't care if i spend my money in single day, but i do not spend my money, i 'lose' it to betting. it's not 50-50 situation, it's just only way. for instance; if i start with 100$ and win 10.000$ eventually in a single day, i know that i won't stop. i will not feel satisfied if i win, but i will feel depressed if i lose. 

i'm not happy about my life. i have a great deal of problems. daily life, family problems, existensial problems. a lot of. but this addiction makes their effect even stronger. i lost all of my strength. both physically and mentally. i do not know how can i deal with this. it'll be all same. all, same. everytime.

my family doesn't even know that i'm addicted to betting. if they learn somehow, i think they wouldn't let me live here anymore. because i lost a great deal of money during last four years. i could even buy myself a cheap and small apartment. or a car. or, i don't know. i'm trying to focus on my home office job. i make a great deal of money for a student. but this addiction distracts me. i cannot focus. i have adhd, and this makes it worse. i start to cry or yell or deal with a panic attack every single hour. i cannot forget that i lost.

i really don't have any plan about how can i get rid of this loop. it's destroying my life. it actually already did. i'm just trying to survive. yes, i don't live. i try to survive. and that's terrible. 

i just wanted to talk. i never do that about my addiction. so, i hope that it'll be a fresh start. thanks for reading.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976072311401367}"

I am from Oregon. I paid upfront for 2 whole months, and the day I was supposed to leave, was 11/1. Billing has already contacted me notifying my stay would be over on 11/1, unless I paid for another month. 

All along, I had planned that I would leave on 11/1. I started looking for a permanent place to stay and got a full time job. In the past week, they opened a new sober place. I decided I would check it out. It was in a terrible area, so I decided I would sign the lease to a new place.

Fast forward, they told me I could not get my medication until I’m discharged (by a therapist or doctor - I haven’t seen one in two weeks). They are holding the medications they prescribed to me and I’ve become accustomed to over the past months, that actually helped with my underlying addiction problems. 

If I told them I would be moving to their new house, but went to “my” new place instead... what would happen? If I ‘AMAd’? And took the meds?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997465968132019}"

2019-11-01 07:28:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/dq2xko/writing_an_argument_between_your_growth_self_and/,Writing an argument between your growth self and your habit self,"So I've just started a planned 1 month sober this November, cutting out alcohol, weed and trying to cut out cigarettes too (alcohol is the most problematic, weed is my strongest addiction). I just got back from the gym and I really fancied a cigarette. I started arguing with myself in my head and then decided to write it down.

I got my bullet journal/ideas book and wrote ""growth self"" at the top of one page and ""habit self"" at the top of the other, then started with habit self saying ""you should have a cigarette"". Growth self argued back that I don't even enjoy them. Habit self said that ill enjoy this one and it was a reward for going to the gym. Growth self told him that it goes against the whole point of the gym, is bad for my cardio system etc. The retort was ""don't care, want to smoke, I have an oral fixation, I can't not"", to which growth self replied ""bullshit, you just go easy on yourself and try to lock Cimejies in bad habits. Im here to help him grow, so fuck off.""

At which point habit self relented, saying he'd be back, and growth self said he would be waiting for him.

Ok sure it sounds a bit odd, but I found it super helpful. When you force your habitual/addictive self to try to explain why you should do the bad thing, as long as you have a clear idea of why you're trying to break those habits you can argue against pretty effectively. I hope to keep this technique going over time and use it with booze, weed, unhealthy food etc, maybe even extend it to my social anxiety and generally reclusive nature. I'm sure this isn't something I've just made up but maybe it can be a helpful tool - get the fight out of your head and onto the page in black and white so you can refute your habitual self point by point.",61,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9535895586013794}"
