What's crazy is I felt fine days ago when I was more or less sober. I have hobbies I love. I have people I love and they love me. It all goes away when I use and drink heavily. All that remains is desire to consume more and the guilt that comes with it. 

It's this endless thought loop of realization and failure. I've known this forever, but every time I'm sober the realization fades. It's frustrating knowing exactly what you are doing wrong but repeatedly being too weak to fix it. 

I'm 20 years old. I can't even buy alc legally and I've been to AA meetings. I know I should just stop. 

This shit is hard. I love you all.",2

Hugely marijuana and alcohol. 
I got a DUI at the very beginning of February and honestly didn‚Äôt change my behavior much ‚Äî just more depressed drinking at home than fun drinking with friends I guess. 
I smoked more following my dui than years before, hitting my dab pen pretty much constantly and falling back into recreational downers too. 

The more my court date got pushed back the more I welcomed myself into the ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù mindset and then covid hit and I felt like everyone started to match my mindset. Drinking everyday? Fine! Being stoned 24/7? Acceptable. And for some reason, watching lots of people fall into my very standard lifestyle made me realize how fucked up it is so spend all of your time fucked up. 

So about 3-4 weeks ago I decided to rock my shit. Cold turkey from all substances, exercise everyday (my fatass can almost run for the first time, ever?), at least 1.5 gallons of water daily. 
It‚Äôs weird to say it but this is the first time I feel happy in my entire adult life. I get excited about things, I can read and actually remember it, I only wake up maybe 3 times a night when it used to be 20+. I actually eat real food now???

I‚Äôve tried to get sober before, then got bored and tried to tell myself moderation is where it‚Äôs at ‚Äî but I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt really think I will ever be able to have a middle ground. So for now, I‚Äôm gonna be sober for as long as possible, and I‚Äôm so excited for life again.",38

Also is there a subreddit discord or something? I think since a lot of us are going through similar struggles (albeit with difference substances-but addiction is addiction) it would be really helpful to have.

I've been trying to quit a severe porn addiction since I was...20. Am 25, quickly approaching 26(in like a few weeks). Haven't been able to due to shitty family dynamics, no help/support, and previous shenanigans with mental health professionals(Read: false diagnosis and pill prescriptions leading to emotional bluntness and later post-off-the-pills still remaining state of not being able to always connect to my emotions, further driven by my DOC, amongst other things, too many factors, not easy to get everything).  


I remember being so elated to finally know the last of my problems. My particular past learning meant I -didn't- want comfort. I knew the brain grew when challenged. I wanted hard. I wanted difficulty. All while stuck in a society that literally insults education and learning and those who try to learn. I had a long list of goals including learning a new language to be done by 25.  
None of those have happened. I'm, or can be, pissed the everlasting eff off, to say the least. Some of it is withdrawal. Some is actual baggage I need to sort out with my therapist, provided I manage to get to a point with him where he fully comprehends my situation(we have had some communication kerfuffles.).  


I've also, for the the last seven years, survived one year at a time. ""If I really want to die, then give it my all this year, then decide on my birthday."" I don't celebrate my birthdays, they are benchmarks, evaluation points for me to determine whether its worth continuing. I have tried. A hell of a lot. And my family is finally improving but I'm not sure I have it in me anymore to continue. Especially if I can't get a bachelors and masters in psychology, my life has hinged on this discipline, I wish to learn it and try and give back. I am not sure if  I'll be able to in my country.

I have lacked  a normal childhood, adolescence, and so far a supposed adulthood. I have never held a job. Never had romantic relationships(and have strict boundaries in terms of age-gap and a strong moral compass, I want a proper innocent romance within my age boundaries, thanks, so I'm unlikely to get that in today's age) or consistent friends and have social anxiety aplenty. Not to mention I'm a feminist and refuse to fit into stereotypical guy roles in again, a very gendered society. No thanks, I'm not losing my man card by liking plushies or treating women and men equally on all counts.

How many of made it post 25? Did you get to learn what you wanted? Do you have ambitions/dreams/goals still? Please tell me there's something beyond this. Tell me by telling me who you are. Show me your humanity.  
And yes, definitely roll your eyes and go ""Dude, just a tad pretentious ATM aren't ya?"" while you are at it, but tell me the truth, without using it as an excuse to inflict hurt.  


If you managed to read this despite it's ramblingness, if it made an ounce of sense, thank you, for your patience, for your understanding, your kindness. And I wish you well in turn, regardless of the former. Best of efforts to all of us.",1

I used drugs for practically most of my life, but whenever I turned 15 it turned into me using them heavily. My girlfriend and I would do drugs together everyday, all throughout the day for a year, and during that time we always listened to music. Wether it was while we were in the car going to get drugs, while we were fucked up, or while we were feeling like shit because we couldn‚Äôt find any, we *always* listened to music. 

Music used to be my favorite thing in the world. If I was upset it made me forget for a min, if I was happy it made me happier. It was my passion. Of course, we had our favorite songs to listen to while getting high, but that always changed and we were finding new things to listen to all the time.

Now, after getting sober, I can‚Äôt listen to music. *Any* music. It triggers me so bad and makes me feel like I‚Äôm back in that bad time again. The best way I can explain it is that it‚Äôs almost like PTSD, but it‚Äôs with any song. Even songs I‚Äôve never heard before. Every song brings me back into those times, and regardless of if it reminds me of a good night I had while getting fucked up or a bad night, it makes me feel horrible and it triggers my anxiety immensely and immediately. I hate it because music was the one thing that brought me true happiness, and my girlfriend and I used to bond really well together while listening to our favorite songs. Now I have to tell her to not play any music in the car when we‚Äôre going somewhere because of how it makes me feel. 

Has anybody else experienced this? A part of me just wanted to vent and let this out because it‚Äôs extremely upsetting, and another part of me wants to know if I‚Äôm not the only one, or if there‚Äôs anything I can do to stop this...I just want to enjoy my favorite thing again.",3

2020-04-28 04:32:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g9jg6y/severe_withdrawal/,Severe Withdrawal,"Severe Marijuana Withdrawal

Severe Withdrawal

Okay so i‚Äôm going to start off by saying that I am an 18 year old female and I‚Äôve smoked like 4-6 times a day for about a year now. While herb was my main go to I would shake it up with edibles (don‚Äôt ever eat 500mg thinking you‚Äôre a god, because you aren‚Äôt and it will kick your ass), wax (dabs), and I had a cart. I don‚Äôt have a big knack for alcohol and zero interest or experimentation with harder drugs (save a time or two with coke at party or shrooms). Two weeks ago I got pretty viscously ill. All my symptoms at the time pointed to the severe flu. I‚Äôm starting to feel a little better after being sick for about four days (no weed during this time) and then 4/20 rolls around. Self control was nonexistent for me as 4/20 turned into a 3 day event where I was thoroughly fucked up with my girls. After the third day we cool it and I am having severe nausea and vomiting. I‚Äôm super confused at this point as I rarely have negative reactions to marijuana save the occasional nausea or munchies. I assumed I somehow got a flu like illness once again. I decide that during this time it would be a good time to try and quit or at least take a giant tolerance break because the effects of weed on a girls bank account became absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôm a waitress so I‚Äôm also out of work for the most part until this COVID lockdown lifts. 

A week following the last time I smoked has been the worst of my life. I have lost 10-15 pounds from the complete inability to stomach or keep food down (it actually repulses me rn). I had horrendous night sweats and chills constantly. The nausea was probably the worst part, right?

I was largely mistaken. 

The last three days I have had almost completely debilitating anxiety and panic attacks. I‚Äôve never had a panic attack in my life until recent events and let me tell you it is not fun. I was fully convinced I was having a heart attack and went to the ER. My blood pressure was 200/100 ( I am almost always at 122/80 ), and a pulse of 140-150. The hospital just did standard procedures (lab, EKG, covid test), all came back good and indicating i‚Äôm perfectly healthy. Got fluids for dehydration and a pat on the back. They told me that they were fully convinced all of this was related to a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, which is basically a really bad reaction to marijuana that causes severe nausea, vomiting, and all that jazz. As I am writing this post, exactly a week from when I stopped, I am beginning to feel a fragment of better which is a huge step from the complete nightmare this past week has been. 

So yes I have just written a book about marijuana withdrawals, but I thought I would put this out there so people going through similar circumstances know they aren‚Äôt alone. Don‚Äôt be afraid, put down the blood pressure cuff, and stop taking your pulse (unless medically needed). The symptoms regarding withdrawal are really stigmatized and it is believed that the most you‚Äôll get from quitting is insomnia and some vivid dreams. I have had both of these symptoms, but also much much worse. It is not fun. And as I have all of this excruciating freetime being unemployed for the time being and stuck without a mental crutch to smoke, I have begun to realize just how destructive my dependence on weed was to my mental health. Do I still love pot? Absolutely. I‚Äôve had some of the most fun of my life, and the most spiritual connections with people while smoking. I‚Äôm in no way judging anyone, I actually envy you for not having these symptoms. But for whoever is going through a similar situation, it gets better. It took me 7 days to realize that after googling every illness and symptom known to man to try and figure out what is going on with my body. I wish I had someone to reassure me or a post like this to ease my mind. 

Withdrawal is real, and just because you personally don‚Äôt experience it doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist. Everyone‚Äôs experiences will differ, whether this be psychologically or physically. I used weed as a crutch to not have to take antidepressants and keep my mood up. Happy customers, happy tips.    

This experience has taught me just how hazed and cloudy my judgement and moods were while smoking so frequently and without restraint. Even though I feel like absolute shit right now, I have already seen improvements with my optimism, motivation, and personal relationships. So to anyone who is going through the ongoing struggle of a tolerance break, quitting (and staying that way), or having mere curiosity, just know that your pain and experiences are validated. You do not need and justification for how you feel or how your body reacts to substances. You are brave and can endure this journey if you center yourself. 

I hope this post helped someone, apologies again for the damn novel.",2

I‚Äôm an alcoholic and an addict. I drank alcohol daily, used drugs, and the end of my drinking was pretty much with the goal of dying. I got sexually assaulted in April and I drank a fifth a day pretty much until I went to rehab in June. My sober date was July 28. Today, I was supposed to have 9 months. 

The quarantine has been excruciating for me. I have no family I‚Äôm close too and I live alone so I was feeling very scared and isolated. In the program, when you are struggling you are supposed to reach out‚Äîmeet up with someone, do service work, etc. Well, I ended up coming down with COVID. I was a presumed positive case, but they wouldn‚Äôt test me because I live in rural Illinois and have no underlying conditions. Volunteering was out of the question. When I was actively sick, I couldn‚Äôt leave my apartment because I didn‚Äôt want to get my neighbors sick. I had a fever for 3 weeks, my blood pressure was high, my heart murmur came back, and I was pretty much bedridden. I am a super active person and normally run really low. I am also very social. My goal was to not drink no matter what. I didn‚Äôt really consider there were other ways to relapse. All I knew is that I was sinking into a huge depression and I felt like I would never get better, never hug or be held or laugh with someone, etc. All pretty crazy and irrational thoughts but I felt in a very dark place.

So I overdosed on my medication. I didn‚Äôt take a lethal dose, I just wanted to sleep for 24 hours or so, but I didn‚Äôt bother to take into consideration that my respiration was off, my heart was weird and my blood pressure was high. I did the same thing after I woke up only I took double. A few days later I called my friend in the program and we talked about it. I sobbed the whole time. I knew that for myself I considered what had happened a relapse as well because I took the medication twice without using any spiritual tools or asking for help. I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone in my support system, my therapist or reach out to the program and I didn‚Äôt tell anyone for days. 

I got my white chip and I was honest about what happened. I don‚Äôt talk a lot in meetings but since I opened up about something that was really painful I know feel a lot more comfortable talking. I‚Äôve been communicating with my therapist, reaching out to people in the program, and adding as many zoom meetings as I can a day. I have started to heal and feel pretty healthy again. Most importantly, I got a dog. It is so helpful to get out of my head and pay attention to someone else, even if it is my sweet puppy. I really feel like I‚Äôm starting over. What happened was scary because I never thought that I would try to hurt myself like that before. I had a suicide attempt when I was a teenager but it‚Äôs been ten years. I‚Äôm just so relieved it‚Äôs over, I‚Äôm feeling better, and that I have 12 days as of now.",1

He got home January 29th and since then has managed to get a really good job and has an awesome gf and she has a kid.  She supported him most of the last 2 years while he was in prison.  Anyways. His gf calls me and tells me she found him smoking something out of foil.  She said it didnt smell like wax (weed concentrate) like he said it was.  She also found a 5$ bill rolled up with a black, sticky substance on it.  She said he keeps denying shit but everytime he gets home from work, hes literally nodding out on the couch and itching all over.  He had trouble with heroin before going to prison but got busted way before he could really get deep into it. I just dont get it.  He was doing so well and now I'm just extremely disappointed. I bought a drug test kit and plan to go see him friday and surprise him when he gets home from work.  I'm gonna ask him to take a test and prove hes not using (even though I'm like 99% sure he is). Any advice on how to handle this would be nice. I know hes an adult but I can't let him do this to himself and his gf has tried confronting him but i know shes scared.  I just really need some guidance on what's the best way to do this and get him help. Thank you for reading.",4

It was far passed the point ‚Äújust suck it up, you loser, scum, you‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù I was watching the doc on Amy Winehouse and the media were like laughing at her. Smiling as they reported on her falling on stage and whatnot.  I‚Äôve been in a lot of rehabs and most had this inner pain. Idk. Just emptiness. And society wants us to get off our ass and be productive and I get that, but they just don‚Äôt understand the years crying alone in the car home from work, way before even touching the drugs in the first place.

Maybe one day I used to be that way too. I don‚Äôt know.",108

However I no longer want to be his significant other . He does crosses boundaries that hurt our relationship but I know he has a problem so I don‚Äôt take it to heart the way I would if he was a person without the addiction . Hope that makes sense . We‚Äôve always been friends first , besides the let downs , we get along . His son loves him. They get along well . He motivates him to do well , he gives him the attention he needs . However there are those ‚Äúparking the car nights ‚Äú that have been coming in every few months . He breaks sobriety for a night & well I don‚Äôt want to be his partner anymore . 
But I do want to continue to support him in his sobriety and rehabilitation and encourage him . 
For the sake of my son and his.

His relapses are also connected to his depression and anxiety . So when the anxiety starts kicking in he ends up not going to work etc and I support him financially and mentally and encourage him to go at his own pace and get back into routine . He‚Äôll stick to it for a few months . Max has been 6 . & than takes another break. 


I don‚Äôt want to support him financially and I don‚Äôt want to be tide down emotionally anymore . I want my own space to care for myself and (I‚Äôm now losing hope that we‚Äôll ever have normal life ) I hope I can build a life with someone one day . I want another baby . I want my own place . Taking care of him stops all that . 

I want to know how I can do both ? & my son is 10 now so I don‚Äôt know how to prep my son .

But now everyone is socially isolated... all the time. The usual coping strategies aren't possible and it seems like everyone is being encouraged to stay online to stay 'connected' but this can be problematic when those habits have been destructive in the past.

Ive only been smoking weed for about a year, and its brought so much good stuff. Theres always a great head change going on and friendships have been built around weed sometimes. But I feel like i enjoy it so much I let it distract me from very important things such as getting back to school, getting my license, my ID, other important things to do. 

Smoking weed brings the ‚Äúidc‚Äù side out of me. But recently, i realized how many problems its caused for me. (Possible turn off from my last partner, friends say ive changed, I forget hang outs I planned) and I want to change for the better. 

I dont want to get rid of weed from my life though. I just want to be sober for a long time to be okay with being sober and take the time to acknowledge all these responsibilities before i can bring it back into my life in a more safe and responsible way. 

Im supposed to take a break on the first day of May and Im so excited to see how this change can benefit me. It might clear up my lungs and make it easier to breathe so i wont have a difficult time working out considering its difficult already exercising because im really  overweight. 

Just need a lot of support and encouragement. Every time I tell my friends I‚Äôm going to quit they laugh and say i wont because I have given in before. Just want some encouraging words to move me through this upcoming journey that I know will not be an easy one. 

Any advice with how you made yourself resist your cravings? Any advice in general?",5

After high school I joined the service and was fine while I was in. I came home and have had issues with anxiety and depression and I have some pretty rough night terrors. I have turned to everything from alcohol to cocaine to weed to party drugs like x and molly and all that. I went through a long period of sobriety from about 2010 when my daughter was born to 2017. I lost my relationship with my ex and have been quietly using ever since. Mostly coke and alcohol. I don‚Äôt know why. It makes me miserable. But it at least diverts my attention from my crushing depression. Nobody knows. Not my family or my friends. I feel like I‚Äôm living a giant lie. I have a great job. Am financially secure and have even kept my salary during this lockdown. But while I sit here alone at night it eats me alive. I want to stop but am embarrassed to get help. I lost my best friend to heroine in 2016 and feel awful using like I do. I look in the mirror and see a fake me. I want all this to go away. I remember a time when I didn‚Äôt think about drugs. I let myself down so much and don‚Äôt know how to fix it.,2

For those who don‚Äôt know, TikTok is a video editor which allows users to share edits between each other. 

What‚Äôs really perverse about this app, is that it analyzes *exactly* what you‚Äôre interested in, and provide *endless* stream of videos called ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù. 

It plays automatically so just scroll down for your dopamine rush.

You could be a star for one moment, because you can get many likes even when you‚Äôre not famous. Then you keep trying to revive that glory, but fail and get sadder and sadder. 
That way, the stream is still flowing, with thousands of videos per minute made by those poor souls.

Most of the time, the algorithm puts you in a case (lgbt supporter, humourist, humour consumer, liberal or democrat, etc.) and you‚Äôre suddenly comforted with hundreds of people who think like you, or at least tell you what you want to hear. 

My girl is a LGBTQ+ ‚Äúsupporter‚Äù (extremist) and she doesn‚Äôt even know why. She‚Äôs smart, but brainwashed by this shit. She can‚Äôt even concentrate for 1h, and it‚Äôs basically impossible to make her quit her phone.

My first post here on Reddit but thought maybe this could be a good place for me to Share my story and hopefully inspire those who maybe going through the same thing a beam of light if they're struggling like I am.

This is me before finally deciding to quit Yesterday night: [https://imgur.com/x3RearS](https://imgur.com/x3RearS)

**My Current Life is like this:**

* Stay High All Day - Smoke every 2-3 Hours Consistently.
* Sleep - 15/17 Hours a Day
* Box of Cigarettes - Before Breakfast because the Nicotine feels Stronger
* Mcdonalds for Breakfast
* Tacobell for Lunch
* Gas Station Twinkies/Iced Lemon Cakes & Chocolate Milk for Dinner: Consistently at that...
* Late to Work and Overslept on Several Occasions and Lost my Job
* Gave up on the Gym because I'd be too High to want to get off my Chair.
* Spend a Couple of Hours Daily Watching Youtube Videos, I would not even play Video Games because moving my Fingers takes too much work.
* Shower maybe Once a Week or so. - Too Lazy to Stand in a Shower for 10 Minutes.
* No Grooming whatsoever, maybe I'll brush my Teeth only in the Morning if even that.
* Credit Score so far dropped 100+ Points
* Behind on my Credit Cards

I used to be much more Active, Eating Healthy, and Enjoyed Personal Development and Growth. I enjoyed the small things in Life like Taking Walks, Interacting with Friends - Yet even with the knowledge that Life would be better it feels as though I am being Controlled by myself, and once the urges kicks in it feels as though I am hypnotized if that makes sense.

I have had no joy, discipline or freedom of thought for a couple of years now stuck in this same Limbo. I have tried 752 times and counting to quit and yet there feels like there is some invisible hand dragging me back into these habits that are killing my soul.

I'm putting myself out there because maybe like some others I truly had no idea how strong mental dependency could be and for me to want to quit every single day and fail to astonishes me on how powerful our minds really are. My parents and all my friends whom I had cut off wrongfully due to my increasing Antisocial Disorder all tried to warned me, I always joked there's no way you can get addicted if you have a powerful mind, and somehow I found myself here.

I am shedding light for those who maybe struggling with me, but I am tired of feeling tired and with this journey in mind, I am exposing who I am now, for a better me tomorrow no matter how shameful I feel about myself.

I have lost my Job, my family's respect, my dignity and courage, and my will to fight. But that doesn't mean the battle is over. I'm determined to be Sober & Happy one day again.

Let us win this time!

I'll be posting Updates about my Quitting Journey, if anyone cares to read them but I feel like this is a good platform where maybe I can find others like me!",13

I work third shift and late into my shift i got a really bad call. I've recently been feeling down thinking about traumatic things that happened, people I've hurt and things i missed out on in my 5 year battle with the demon. I'm really distressed because the call was finding out my cousin who was clean for a year and 10 days from the last time we spoke less than a month ago had overdosed. Its even harder because its so soon after losing my uncle and sadly I found that out while in rehab. Its been really hard these last few hours and im crying my eyes out.

I don't want to disrespect him by relapsing but I really really want a shot of dope but I know if I do I will lose my job and go back to being homeless.

I‚Äôm going to try and make this short: I (M30) casually used drugs and alcohol as a form of self medication for just about all my life. Since I was a teen. I‚Äôm severely depressed and anxious and the occasional drug usage helped. I NEVER had an addictive personality. (And when I mean that, I don‚Äôt mean the ‚Äúthat‚Äôs exactly what an addict would say‚Äù way.) I really never did. Until last summer I fell pretty deep for the first time and casual became pretty heavy. I went from taking a pill here and there every once in a while to blowing them often, as well as coke. Next thing you know I have an addiction and it hasn‚Äôt been the same since and I‚Äôve been struggling. 

Fast forward to November I started dating my current girlfriend(F25) She‚Äôs 100% against any kind of drug use besides weed. (I smoke, as being Cali sober keeps the urges away) she has a zero tolerance. I‚Äôm trying so hard, but today I ran out of weed and wasn‚Äôt in my right mind set, was depressed and I looked toward the only thing I knew that would help and I blew Percocet. 

See my body isn‚Äôt physically addicted, as I haven‚Äôt been regularly using them at all since before we started dating. It‚Äôs just today I was particularly vulnerable and weak. I just wish she‚Äôd understand that and support me. I‚Äôm not the type that‚Äôs stealing from her to get it or abusing her in any way shape or form. My use isn‚Äôt harming her at all. My using wouldn‚Äôt have caused her any harm at all, besides just going against her wishes. I feel as though she‚Äôs not supporting me when I need her the most. But I also understand she has the right to want a relationship with someone who is clean. From my point of view though, if it were her in my shoes...I wouldn‚Äôt give up on her. I love her so much that I would support and help her. Not fight, argue and want to leave her... I feel abandoned by my best friend and the person I‚Äôve grown to love deeply over the last 5 months. 

TLDR; I relapsed and I feel like my girlfriend is being rash and unsupportive and is possibly leaving me. Is she being fair with me? I know I messed up. I just don‚Äôt feel the love and support if she‚Äôs able to just leave me when I need her most...",0

That turned into an addiction itself... He feels as if he has nothing anyone. It's very concerning because he binges drinks. He can for a long time with minimal outward effects ofalcohol but then get obliterated many hours later.
I think so much of this has to do with military culture with encouraging service members to drink, while giving them very little time off. This quarantine makes them feel more like a vacation time.
 I'm not sure how to support someone when they are relapsing so hard core- especially when I have so much anger towards him for it and PTSD towards alcohol throughout my life. Also dealing with my own addiction and learning how to balance out methadone.

Mainly alcohol, but other stuff too. Had a period of time when cocaine became a big issue. Also Xanax. But, honestly, opioids weren't his thing. 

Still, he understood drugs and their effects much better than a layman . Oh, and he was ridiculously smart. The kind if a person on whom everyone relied to come in and solve all problems, both at home and at work, because he usually could. When he wasn't wasted.

So when the autopsy showed a ridiculous amount of heroine in his system, way, way higher than a fatal dose, does that probably mean that it was suicide?

And, yes, it was laced with fentanyl, and he definitely had a fatal dose of it in his system. But, independent of fentanyl, there was also an unreal amount of specifically heroin in his system.

How could it possibly be accidental?

TLDR; my boyfriend's good friend quit heroin, but continues to do other party drugs. Is it okay to voice concern to him about this use despite him overcoming his original addiction ? 

Little back story - I grew up in a family of addicts of many kinds however have not experienced any form of hard drug addiction myself. I hesitate to talk with him because I don't feel like I have his experiences and don't know how to approach him about it.

I've been dating my BF for a little over 1 year now. This a great and we've grown a lot together. When I started dating him he frequently spoke of a friend who was a 'recovered heroin addict' I didn't think much of it as I've grown up around people who had successfully recovered. 

Fast forward to now and I've met him a few times but he is clearly not on a clean path. This may be where I'm on the ignorant side and need help. In my experience my family didn't refer to themselves as recovered unless they removed all street drugs from their life and lived 'clean' (some kept marijuana which is legal in my state) but he doesn't do that. He still partakes in other hard drugs and this makes me feel very uncomfortable.

I can't seem to get the image out of my head that he's just going to slip down that path again, find a new vice to replace his old one since everything is stressful. I've spoken with my boyfriend and he agrees we should express our concern to his friend however neither of us feel like we know enough to do so. Neither of us have his experience, I am the after math of addiction' so I  connected a lot to what I've seen in my family but I've never been in his shoes.

Is it okay to even bring up worry if he's not actively 'addicted' to any particular substance? It's more that he takes everything else other than his original.",3

It ended up good,"I am so sorry you are dealing with this. I'm just curious but are you a man or woman? Truthfully I am glad I logged on and this was the first post that I saw. I am feeling a little anxious and somewhat sad this morning. I have been working on my emotional health and what I have come to discover to be ""c-ptsd"" and the resulting emotional flashbacks.

I think the hardest thing about these processes and experiences... is that it is an everyday thing. I guess what hurts the most is the feeling of ""let down"" when, usually, by the end of the day I am feeling happy, achieved and hopeful (after having worked passionately all day reading the books I love, and creating and continuously updating and posting on my youtube channel...) that when I wake up in the morning, I start off excited and hopeful to restart my day.

But everyday, about an hour or so in the feeling of dread begins to sink in... The realization that I am not now ""informed and cured"" but rather I will be revisiting these harmful memories and hurtful experiences... again and again...

It really is an inspiring process! One that writing this now, I realize I should only be more and more grateful for! I guess the pain just sometimes comes from the realization that it is not all over. Every day I will be flashing back to memories that hurt the worst. Feelings that I deny the best. And emotions I never asked for or wanted or ever really even dreamed that I would have to feel.

...Anyway sorry for the dramatics!! lol this was more for me than for you (hahaha! :P) But I figured since you had experiences with an angry (apparently also violent... I am so sorry!) father... that you might possibly relate?

I dont really associate with having been a victim of physical abuse but I am wondering now if this is something that I actually need to reacknowledge and release....

I guess some of the feelings of sorrow comes from the fact that I have already written about these feelings once now... and I suppose I had that sort of childlike dream that having acknowledged them once would be enough... and that i ""faced it"" and it was all going to go away now!

Regardless, writing this now is I think what is going to really help me get through. I am thinking I am going to copy and paste this and apply it to maybe my own post or some other forums as well. I'd be interested in hearing other peoples responses to this and hopefully maybe also hear and/or offer their support! <3 <3 <3 <3 It sounds so stupid but stuff like this, it really just helps so much to know that we are not all actually alone!!! <3 <3 <3 <3

Please let me know if you relate or have any experiences similar. I think because I have been ""hardly"" physically abused... I always wonder if maybe I am just weak or somehow brought it on myself or like maybe it is just my fault... :'( I know this is not true but you know, you see football players and boxers and guys who take serious and repeated punches to the face and they make it... it seems anyway... appearing remotely unscathed...

And here I've been the victim of physical violence maybe only once or twice in my life and it seems like every morning and I am twitching and flashing back at the fear of coming forward about this :''''( I know that this is all for God's purpose and that acknowledging these facts and feelings will only help make me stronger so that I too can help people like myself and who have had it much much worse.

I would like to think that I am now releasing these feelings and that tomorrow will bring an easier, and more progressive day! <3 <3 <3 I know that I believe that everyday is going to bring a morning and emotional flashback that is just EVEN A LITTLE bit easier and that oneday I am going to get through this completely!!!

Ahh anyway I guess this is a prayer at this point. So thank you to loving and grateful higher power. That I hope to fully and completely embrace as my new and eternally loving and transformed self! (lmao...??!!! <3 <3 <3 <3)

Amen...??? XD XD XD :D :D :D but on a serious note it just felt really good to write this lmao...

thanks for being here guys!!! XD :P <3 <3<3 <3 <3 and thanks for reading!!! :P ;P <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 :) :) :D

Im 16 and have been smoking weed since 8th grade (pretty much daily) and drinking (mostly on weekends, but heavy amounts with friends) for a good amount of time in my short life so far. Basically my parents do not condone this and i've been able to hide and keep it on the down low pretty well, obviously they've caught me a couple of times, and it did not go well, When I was a freshman  it basically became my life and what I always looked forward to (and still today)  the only thing I believed that made me feel happy and not all depressed and shit even though i'm on medications. Anyways I would choose smoking weed over everything, failing every drug test my parents gave me, not giving a shit if they grounded me or took away my phone etc because I always had some weed or at least wax pens so why would i care about being stuck at home as long as I wasn't sober.  They explained to me how weed and alcohol are not ok for me at my age and how i'm gonna be a low life stoner and all that shit parents say to you to get you to stop. Anyways they knew i'm addicted and they made a deal with me that If I stay sober and stop smoking weed then they would allow me to get my license and a car (since I was doing good in school too as a reward). That was enough for me to stop smoking I made it about a month and a half and was supposed to get drug tested soon and if i passed I would get my license april 1st but as u know we went into lockdown and everything closed, basically boredom and anger that I couldn't get what i've been working so hard for got the best of me now that It was uncertain how long we would be stuck inside for, so I said fuck being sober.  I went into a downward spiral real quick. It started with me picking up a stizzy. Well i have a really addictive personality so that was mistake number one. It wouldn't just be one more pickup like I always told myself. It escalated into me smoking every single day again, and picking up again until I didn't have anymore money. Once that happened I started looking in my parents medicine cabinet and popping all the hydros, and anything else that would get me high,  stealing their alcohol and getting drunk as shit in the middle of the day all the time, and eventually stealing money from my parents bedroom (granted it was actually my bday money that they were holding for me so I couldn't spend it on weed and alcohol) one day they caught me drunk as shit because my breath smelled of fireball and I wasn't acting right. so they took my phone and went through it and saw that I picked up 5 tabs of acid too during this quarantine (did i forget to mention that), Plus all of the other bullshit i've been doing these years including countless videos of me drunk and high as fuck with my friends, just being so stupid. That broke them and basically made them decide to change my life around whether I liked it or not. Basically not allowing me into my room during the day, taking off my door, making me change schools now fuck, and not letting me get my license for god knows how long  not to mention the total lack of trust and uncertainty of who I even was. It really hurt them when they found out  the extent of what I was doing just to not be sober. I Know that I can't blame a virus for making me do all of this shit but boredom is definitely a trigger to get fucked up and being stuck inside doesn't help at all. The worst feelings are thinking of what my life could've been right now (me riding around town in my new car with tha ladies, with my parents trust and them not being concerned about me 24/7 and all the good times I would have with my friends especially now I'm not gonna be able to go back to the same school and see any of them) I just feel so pathetic especially since they have child locks on the medicine cabinet and alcohol cabinet as well as not being allowed in anyone else's room. It feels so embarrassing and depressing.  The only thing I want right now is a fat blunt to make me feel better and able to sleep. But I have no choice to be sober now, hopefully I can gain their trust back soon. (im posting this after their asleep because i'm not allowed to have a computer now but I just felt like I needed to vent somewhere.)",1
2020-04-24 01:32:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g72p50/help/,Help,"TLDR: Stream of consciousness from drunk person.

I'm a drinker - have tried to stop multiple times. Think I first realised it was a problem and different for me than a lot of other people in my early 20s. I'm 33 now and tonight I got drunk and did a bit of coke secretly whilst I was video chatting my very sensible friends. Boyfriend went to bed. Obviously I am still up. Have gone to the living room to sleep  ""because he was snoring"" - that was my lie. I came in to find booze. Feel like I need it. Found a can of beer on the balcony and quietly downed it. Then lay on sofa but not enough buzz. Quietly pulled out a bottle of wine from the rack with a screw cap. Have been downing as much as I can to make the anxiety go away. I hide the bottles and the cans. 

This is just today. On the 23rd of February I tried to kill myself. It was shocking to me as much as anyone. I just felt like I had lost control of my life and all I could see was utter darkness. I survived (obviously) and since then was put on Zoloft ehich has had a huge impact. Seems like it was chemical, and probably exacerbated by the drinking, but I remember it being there before I ever got drunk. Still, I can't help but feel that I am a bad 

Anyway, from the time when I was 22 and first realised I was drinking a bottle of wine a night and couldn't sleep without it, to now, I have done many embarrassing things whilst drunk. And dangerous, I assume. I once got home so drunk that I split my chin open on the floor trying to go to the toilet. My housemates came into the room to see me lying in a pool of blood and thought I was dead. I was fine, they just had to glue my chin together and I couldn't smile for a month. 

But, as the title suggests, I'm interested to understand how the scale of alcoholism works. Currently I am aware I am drinking 2 bottles of wine (or more) a night. It seems a lot but I fear I was drinking this much or more before but just never counted my drinks at a bar. 

I am functioning (apparently), have a good job, have managed to basically blag my way through being drunk and hungover at work events. Noone seems to care! But I am quite sure many of my colleagues are also functioning alcoholics. We even joke. 

At this point I have to apologise for the novel, I shall put a TLDR at the top. But what I am worried about is the slope. I know already alcohol makes my anxiety bad. I know that when I don't drink I feel happier, but soon that feeling wears off. I get bored. I want to be like everyone else and not think about it. But when I don't think about it, more and more it is turning into a fear of sobriety. I have been at conferences where I have snuck back to the hotel at 12pm to order a bottle of wine from room service because the 2 bloody Mary's I had at 9 are wearing off. I have been perpetually drunk where I am just lying to everyone the whole time. I have got so drunk on the last night that I can barely speak, that I have dropped a full glass of gin and tonic on the floor mid conversation for no reason other than I'm wasted, whilst everyone else is lightly tipsy. I have woken up at 5am in a hotel room on the other side of the world feeling a black hole of hungover despair where the only way out seems top find a ligature and hang myself. 

So how do I get out? How do I stop, or at least stop it progressing? I get scared when I wake up drunk and rummage for a bottle of spirits so that I can secretly keep drinking because I'm so afraid of how I will fewl if I sober up. I feel I must be on the road, butI don't think I can stop. Again, I am sorry for the wall of text - I am drunk, obviously, and I feel real affinity with you all. Basically you're funny fuckers, and I get you. I hope you are all doing OK in the lockdown (although I assume literally noone will read this far).

All the best to you.",6

We talked about plans for the future, what his psychiatrist and him talk about, etc. Then two days later he goes to pick up a few items he missed and he just never came back.

Desperate for sobriety but unable to feel grounded.,"I‚Äôve been using ketamine regularly for the past 4 years (now aged 21) for some periods every waking moment, at some points spending over ¬£400 a week, using an ounce every 5 days. I got diagnosed with ADHD last year at the age of 20, and I think that explains the root of my use as k slows my brain down to a level where I‚Äôm so disassociated that I don‚Äôt feel worked up or uncomfortable in my own skin. It‚Äôs fucked up so much of my life and I‚Äôm now in a position where I have so much to live for and work towards, and in that sense I don‚Äôt want to use anymore, and I haven‚Äôt used for a few weeks but every day I have the feeling of being uncomfortable in my own skin and unable to relax. I have episodes of feeling like I need to crawl out of my skin and can‚Äôt sit, talk or focus because I‚Äôm so uncomfortable. Does anyone have any advice as a recovered addict with ADHD? 
Also I am medicated (Medikinet, slow release Ritalin) and have weekly sessions with an ADHD coach, and whilst they have helped me completely get my life together my need to be sedated hasn‚Äôt diminished. 
I try not to use as I don‚Äôt want to be in debt the way I used to, also I‚Äôve experienced severe medical problems over the past year and a half with dozens of emergency room admissions due to stomach problems because of the ket. Recently I‚Äôve been drinking when I don‚Äôt use but it doesn‚Äôt satisfy that feeling at all and makes me crave ketamine even more.

I always hear people in meetings saying that when they were using, they felt like a shell of themselves. Or that they were miserable each and every day. Or that they actually wanted to die, or were trying to kill themselves with the drugs. And I feel like there's something wrong with me, because I cannot relate to this. Not to say that bad things didn't happen to me when I was using, because they did. But I wasn't miserable every day. I did not want to kill myself. Honestly, I didn't want my life to change (except that I wanted to stop getting locked up). And now, I am glad that I am doing the things that I need to do in my life, gaining back the trust of my family, holding down a job, etc. But those things do not bring me any joy. I feel happy that I'm doing what is making my family and loved ones happy and proud, but these things do not bring me joy outside of that. And it's not that I want to get high or anything. I just don't look back and see that as a miserable time of my life. 

And this sounds terrible, but honestly, I sometimes miss that life- not the actual using, but I miss the people that I knew that have passed away, I miss those times. I go to meetings and I talk to people, but I moved back to my home state, and I don't click with people here. I find myself feeling like I was actually happier and more ""myself"" when I was using.

Is there something wrong with me? Is this weird? Has anyone else ever felt this way? I don't mean to come off as ungrateful or anything. I just really want to understand why I feel this way, because I WANT to feel joy and I want to look back on my old life and say I'm glad that it is over.

2020-04-23 10:43:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g6nvpx/drug_addict_boyfriend/,Drug Addict Boyfriend,"I am in a relationship with a recovering drug addict. Everything was great when we started dating and I really believed this was the man I was going to marry one day. There is no doubt in my mind that this man loves me very much and is serious about me (even his parents tell me that he speaks about marriage). 

However, he has frequently lied to me and kept stuff from me like the fact that he is an addict. I only found out when our relationship started going downhill; he didn‚Äôt spend as much time with me, would hang up on me when I call him and I wouldn‚Äôt hear from him for hours on end. This situation got so bad that I decided to confide in his parents. They informed me that he is a drug addict and that they believe he relapsed. He is addicted to ice. I was extremely hurt, angry and shocked that day and was determined to end it which even his own mother encouraged because of her own experiences with her husband. He is a recovering addict but has stayed sober for 20+ years. 

When he knew that I found out about the drugs, he quit on his own cold turkey and became psychotic. His parents decided to get him help and he was in rehab for 6 weeks. He has now been out of rehab for almost 4 months and hasn‚Äôt relapsed but is currently medicated for both addiction and bipolar. He also received electric shock treatment for the first time in rehab. I encouraged him to seek counselling which he has been doing. These are positive signs but it has been extremely difficult for me because he is a different person now. He doesn‚Äôt have the same zest for life like he used to have and is very quiet most of the time. He gets tired very easily and doesn‚Äôt want to do much activities with me. I would suggest to go for walks etc and he rejects my ideas.

I am not sure if I should stay with him or end the relationship. I am really scared that he will relapse and won‚Äôt recover long term. I was raised in a very religious and strict household. I have never smoked cigarettes nor engaged in that partying lifestyle. I do realise that we are very different but I know that he has a lot of great qualities such as the fact that he is kind, loving, genuine and fights for our relationship. He never was physically abusive with me although he was mentally and emotionally abusive. He didn‚Äôt pressure me to be intimate with him even though he was on drugs because I was not ready. I also want to add that he lied about his success stating that he had his own business and I recently found out that it is his fathers business. I feel he has insecurities as he did not complete high school. I am a law student and I am also worried that his actions could cost me my career that I have worked so hard for. Sorry for the long post but I wanted to provide the full picture so I could get much needed advice. I hear of some inspiring recoveries but how do I know for sure that this will be the case with him given that he has relapsed many times before? How do I rebuild trust? I am also concerned that he has lost girlfriends over this issue in the past, and this was not enough reason for him to not repeat the same mistakes with me. I feel if I was not enough back then for him to say no to the drug, why would I be enough now? 

TL;DR! 

I am 23 years old and I am dating a 27 year old drug addict. We having been dating for a year and a half. He is recovering at the moment but I am not sure if I should stay or break up with him?  I am very indecisive at the moment as I do not want any regrets.",7

I was 61 days sober until Feb 27 this year. Doing some 2 weeks before seemed to plant the seed again, after I felt SO SURE I'd freed myself.

Now I haven't gone more than 2 days clean for 56 days. Tax return? Gone in a week. Stimulus check? Gone in a week. Fuck, I have really dug my grave. I'm so sad and scared of the reality I constructed with this drug. I use it to numb the anxiety it causes. Its so nonsensical, yet it feels like my ruler. 

Everyone I've gotten to know during these years of addiction has NO idea. I was an addict basically my whole relationship with my boyfriend, with whom I told I don't want to be with, just because I'm feeling myself closer and closer to spiraling. That the person I really am is someone no one truly knows, because since moving to this town for college, drugs of all kinds have been my #1 crutch and priority.

My family doesn't know, and I feel in too deep to shatter the illusion of the independent yet vulnerable woman I left home as. The woman I could be. Id have to move 8 hours home as a 24 year old drug addict who failed college and doesn't have enough money to put down a deposit on an apartment. I wish I'd stopped when the habit stopped being exciting. I've caught myself choked up driving home with a new bag in my lap, because I know what it symbolizes, and how I keep hurting myself.

Ive wished for death a lot on the comedown. But that'd be too easy, and easy is what I've gotten used to by having the illusion of control and euphoria as a coke addict. Im so ready to love myself again. Forgive myself. I just keep on surrendering",28

2020-04-22 23:15:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g6faaq/video_game_addiction_recovery/,Video Game Addiction & Recovery,"This post is a simple review and evaluation of a problem I‚Äôve noticed in our society. It is something I‚Äôve noticed in my life and others around me, family and close friends. I‚Äôve seen it destroy lives, cloud judgement, and ruin family structure without the victim even knowing what might have caused their turmoil. There are so many different distractions and siphons that slowly occupy precious time of our lives, and we have to be aware of how we spend our time. What might be something healthy and beneficial can turn into an overwhelming weight that cannot be easily so shed. The burden I‚Äôd like to review is that of addiction in video game users.

Almost a year ago, I spontaneously decided to get rid of all gaming consoles I owned. I had played a dozen different games consistently, however, I needed to focus on work and schooling, and I felt that some habits needed to be cut from my life. I had loved playing different games that had creative world-building adventures and allowed for online relationships to develop. Video games were an imaginative outlet, and I was relaxed and engaged when I played. It sounds simple, and I know a lot of my peers understand what I felt. Nothing really compares to the immersion of adopting a character and playing in a different world; it‚Äôs unique and particular to video games. Though I enjoyed playing, I knew I spent too much time during the week sitting in front of my television; hence, I threw the old gamestation in the garbage.

After a week of not playing video games, I immediately regretted my decision, and I thought I could go back. What was I supposed to do with all this extra time? I even went to the dumpster where I had thrown everything away, because I was desperate to play on desert battlefields or hellish landscapes fighting demons. It was rough, but I managed to find other outlets. I started calling my family more often. I started to hang out with friends instead of staying in, and I started to read. Another week went by, and I noticed something different about my attention span. When I was a kid, I read books constantly. That was all I had, especially since my family didn‚Äôt have video games. I could read anything and the stories would fill my mind. When I started playing video games as I got older, I noticed it didn‚Äôt happen as much. I read less and less, because it didn‚Äôt have the same effect. Reading was slow, it didn‚Äôt give the same stimulus, and I wasn‚Äôt about to sit down and read for an hour when I could consume flashing lights instead. One day, a familiar sensation returned, just sitting in my breakroom at work, where I‚Äôd usually read to pass by my lunch hour. The imagery began to flow; I began to have slower, methodical thoughts that constructed the words I was reading. I felt the words take on new meaning, and I felt as though I was reading without anything pulling my attention away. This experience was so profound, and it was so closely correlated to my video game disposal, that I decided to research into attention and video game usage.

First, I would like to clarify my advocacy and interest in this population. I do not believe all gamers are addicts. I think that any habit can essentially become an addiction, and when a habit starts to exhibit negative consequences in personal, family, social, occupational and other relevant areas of functioning, it is a problem in the addict‚Äôs life, not a normal user (World Health Organization, 2018). Addictions form from a myriad of different reasons, however, video game addiction has unique triggers and compulsions that need to be addressed. I feel as though this issue isn‚Äôt necessarily being taken seriously, even with so many negative aspects of this addiction being manifested in our society. I will outline my thoughts, and research found on why video game addiction might develop, how experiences might impact the addicted gamer, and the steps taken to recover from video game addiction.

When a healthy, normal activity becomes consuming and destructive, there is often a physiological switch that oftens removes inhibition in the addicted brain. We can see this change (mental and physical) with people who have a gambling compulsion or dependence on methamphetamines.  Addiction specialists observed that addict subjects tend to confuse pleasure with happiness when linking emotional states to their addictive activities (Gros, Debue, Lete, & Leemput, 2020). Gros et al. (2020) found that this confusion between pleasure and happiness is prevalent in those who are addicted to video games. Fulfilling happiness can be sidelined by temporary pleasure, and this confusion can be observed with addictive behaviors. According to Lustig (2017), addictions together with depression are two rampant afflictions in the last decades and constitute the harmful extremes of pleasure (associated with the dopaminergic system) and happiness (associated with the serotoninergic system), respectively. Confusing these two healthy behaviors can trigger a path towards immediate gratification that comes from video games. Personally, I have experienced stress from work, relationships or school, and I have felt the call of playing a quick game online to relieve this sort of anxiety. It is a pursuit of pleasure that creates the perfect stage for someone to become addicted to video games.

Where do we see video game addiction flourish? Are there certain populations that might be at risk? What will be the impact of an addicted population? As the gaming population increases, addicts will be prevalent in our society, and this in turn impacts family life, economic growth, and cultural development. From the movie *Inception,* the image of the ‚Äúdreamers‚Äù  locked in a basement for their entire life comes to mind. In a sense, addiction is the locked basement for a habitual behavior. Addicts had poorer mental health and cognitive functioning including poorer impulse control and ADHD symptoms compared to controls. Additionally, addicts displayed increased emotional difficulties including increased depression and anxiety, felt more socially isolated, and were more likely to display internet pornography pathological use symptoms (Stockdale & Coyne, 2018). Any addict will suffer in quality of life, and I can definitely confirm this research. It goes without saying that isolation, depression, and poor impulse control will lead to a slew of different issues amongst the population. Though I wouldn‚Äôt say my mental health suffered, I definitely experienced lapses in my attention and focus, and isolation, especially from playing online (which is the majority of gaming today). 

With addiction amongst gamers growing, counselors and other mental health workers are discovering methods to help treat and rehabilitate those afflicted with this modern-day addiction. Throughout the internet, you can find forums, instructional videos, and other resources that help in combating personal addiction. This subreddit is a perfect example of a group where solidarity can be found and help extended. Personally, I have used forums to help find reassurance and specific assistance with an addiction or obstacle, and I know there are people with whom you can confide. There are also treatments developed by therapists to help guide you back to balanced usage. Mindfulness treatment is effective for substance use disorders and behavioral addictions, and may be a promising intervention for video game addiction (Li, et al., 2017). Being aware of playing time and the consequences that come from overplaying need to be constantly evaluated, or you risk becoming a slave to a pleasurable addiction. The future is not bleak, there is a community behind the pursuit of recovery, and anyone can achieve balance and wellness. I hope that we can help those around us that might still be controlled by this addiction. I hope we can reach out to one another, to provide support and guidance. A supportive network that is aware of an issue can surely address it, and I know that a community can be brought back from the edge.

Addiction is a disease that affects millions of Americans. It is extremely [widespread](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra1511480?articleTools=true), with an estimated 8 percent to 10 percent of individuals in the United States 12 years of age or older (between 20 to 22 million people) addicted to at least one substance. The human costs of this problem are incalculable. The annual financial costs, meanwhile, are estimated to be close to [$700 billion](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra1511480?articleTools=true) due to losses in productivity, crime, and additional health care costs associated with addiction.

Just because an individual has a few drinks or very occasionally consumes illicit drugs does not mean that they have a problem with addiction. Furthermore, just because an individual may struggle with the responsible use of a drug like alcohol does not mean they have been overcome by addiction.

Addiction is distinct from substance-use disorder, which is [defined](https://www.verywellmind.com/dsm-5-criteria-for-substance-use-disorders-21926) by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as being the recurrent use of drugs or alcohol resulting in clinically and functionally significant impairment. Such impairment can negatively impact one‚Äôs health, social networks, and the ability to perform functions necessary for either school or work. The disorder ranges from mild to severe. It is only when substance-use disorder becomes severe that it becomes synonymous with addiction.

In the past, addiction was considered to require a substance. In other words, one was addicted to alcohol, to nicotine, to heroin, and so on. Within this paradigm, it was believed that regular use of the substance in question eventually led to the individual‚Äôs development of both a physical dependency and a tolerance for it. The latter would lead to the need to increase the amount of the substance consumed to achieve the desired effect. The former would result in withdrawal symptoms when use was discontinued. Some of the most common substances that can produce this type of addiction include opioids, stimulants like cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol. The use of the latter two substances is, in general, more socially accepted than the use of illicit drugs, like cocaine and heroin, but they still can produce deleterious effects.

While this depiction of addiction is still largely accurate, it does not account for other types of addiction that do not involve substances. Such addictions pertain to compulsive activities. At this time, gambling is the only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5, but a growing body of research suggests that other behaviors possess similar pathologies when done compulsively. These include video game-playing, binge-watching television, and having sex. Addictions of this kind may not be as physically harmful as addictions involving substances like cigarettes, alcohol, or opioids, but they can still cost lasting social and emotional damage to those caught in the web of addiction, as well as an addicted individual‚Äôs close friends and family.

**Why Don‚Äôt Addicts Just Quit?**

Individuals who are struggling with addiction do not simply lack the willpower to stop. The belief that one‚Äôs inability to break the cycle of addiction is due to personal shortcomings is not accurate. While inaccurate, such a belief is not irrational. Many individuals can enjoy the occasional glass of wine or weekend trip to Atlantic City without incident. From their perspective, they do not experience a strong compulsion to continue using an intoxicating substance or participating in an activity such as gambling once it has become clear that continued use is a bad idea. They can stop, and they assume that others should be able to, as well.

Individuals with addiction do not experience the world in this manner. They may earnestly wish to quit, but they cannot do so. This is not a question of willpower. **Consequently, we should think of addiction not as a personal shortcoming or moral failure, but as a neurobiological issue**. Certain brain functions of those who have developed an addiction become hardwired in a manner that allows the addiction to thrive. Furthermore, certain individuals are more genetically predisposed to develop addictions than others.

**What Addiction Does to the Brain**

Addictive drugs and behaviors activate regions in the brain that are associated with reward pathways and the pleasure center of the brain. When activated by the perceived reward, the brain releases the neurotransmitter [dopamine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra1511480?articleTools=true), which causes an individual to feel good. Certain normal activities‚Äîsuch as when one eats, has sex, or accomplishes a difficult task‚Äîserve as rewards. They activate the brain‚Äôs pleasure center and result in the release of dopamine. Using certain drugs, such as nicotine, alcohol, opioids, or cocaine, also releases dopamine. Similarly, winning at a game of chance or doing well at a video game do, too.

Over time, dopamine ceases to be released merely due to the use of these drugs or participation in these activities (i.e., ‚Äúthe rewards‚Äù). Similar to how Russian physiologist [Ivan Pavlov](https://www.psychologistworld.com/behavior/pavlov-dogs-classical-conditioning) noted that dogs can be conditioned to salivate once they understand that a bell indicates that dinner is about to be served, the brain becomes flooded with dopamine in anticipation of the reward, and certain external stimuli or cues tell an individual with addiction that a reward is imminent. These cues (the smell of a bar, the bright lights of the casino, seeing friends with whom one used drugs, etc.) then trigger cravings.

This kind of conditioning persists well after the drug has been flushed from the body. Consequently, a person with addiction may still be troubled by these cravings even after years of sobriety.

Certain drugs, particularly opioids and cocaine, also disrupt the brain‚Äôs reward center in a manner that is distinct from more natural rewards by preventing satiation. When one attains a natural reward, by eating a meal, for example, one‚Äôs dopamine cells eventually stop firing. Any excess dopamine within the brain‚Äôs synapses is then removed by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). [Opioids ](https://www.psychologistworld.com/behavior/pavlov-dogs-classical-conditioning)and [cocaine](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a2b5/3e0426d988f6b20f2520216f040c36870fd9.pdf/), however, release a far more potent dose of dopamine and then prevent the clearing away of excess dopamine by inhibiting the release of GABA. Opioids and cocaine effectively keep GABA from doing its job, which means that additional dopamine continues to flood the brain‚Äôs receptors.

**The rush of dopamine is so rewarding that, eventually, the person with addiction becomes more focused on obtaining the dopamine release produced by the drug or activity and less focused on obtaining more natural rewards. The addiction effectively reinforces itself.**

People with addiction may not even be conscious of the cues associated with their addiction. A study conducted by [Anna Rose Childress](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/09/the-addicted-brain/), a neuroscientist based at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Center for Studies of Addiction, found that salience attribution (which is the mental equivalent of focusing a camera on one object and leaving the remaining objects in one‚Äôs field of vision a series of blurs) is so powerful among even former addicts that they may not even be conscious of the cues. When a group of recovering cocaine addicts were shown an image of a crack pipe for just 33 milliseconds, a period of time one-tenth the length of a blink, the reward circuitry in their brains lit up. Even though they were not cognizant of seeing the pipe, the portion of the brain that activates reward pathways knew it was there.

On top of altering the reward pathways within the brain, addiction can also significantly[ reduce the amount of dopamine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMra1511480?articleTools=true) that is released either by natural rewards, drug use, or compulsory behavior. Not only do such individuals become less interested in natural rewards, but they also feel as though they need more and more of the drug or compulsory behavior to achieve the same level of euphoria as when the addiction was in its nascent state. Furthermore, on top of the severe withdrawal symptoms associated with drugs like alcohol and opioids, the absence of the desired reward leads to stress responses that result in dysphoria and anxiety. As addiction becomes more severe, the individual often becomes less concerned with experiencing euphoria than escaping the distress associated with non-use.

Addiction also alters portions of the prefrontal cortical regions‚Äîthe areas of the brain responsible for overseeing executive functions like decision making and responding to exterior stimuli. This seriously impairs an individual‚Äôs capacity for regulating behavior and emotions, compounding one‚Äôs inability to follow through on making a healthy decision. Once again, this only reinforces the addiction.

Once again, addiction is a disease. It has pernicious effects on the brain, particularly neural pathways that control reward-seeking behavior. It is not a moral failing or a weakness, and it cannot be treated as such. People struggling with addiction can‚Äôt just quit, and ‚Äútough love‚Äù approaches can exacerbate feelings of social isolation and result in one‚Äôs sinking deeper into addiction.

While there are pharmacological remedies that can help to offset cravings and to make quitting easier, this is only the beginning in a long and arduous process that often requires abstaining from environments, stimuli, and individuals that can trigger cravings. Such strategies can help to curb cravings, but they are not always foolproof. The best way to overcome addiction is to not only abstain but also to restore healthy reward networks in the brain and to reestablish healthy social networks, either through familial support or a 12-step program.

Long story is that I got myself wrapped up in alcoholism and benzo addiction during my last year of grad school while my marriage was ending (my fault).

I didn‚Äôt go to my graduation but instead spent the next 6 weeks in rehab. It was hard but worth it - I already had a job lined up so I started it immediately after rehab and moved into a sober house.


Overall it was a good experience but I never got a sponsor and didn‚Äôt really go to meetings (my fault again). The feelings of emptiness started creeping in again - I was separated, had no one in my life (as in a partner), had a stressful job that I didn‚Äôt like and a coworker I did like but couldn‚Äôt have.


I found the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù time to use - I went on a 2 week trip to Europe and used opiates because I knew they‚Äôd be out of my system by the time I‚Äôd have drug testing.


I had drug testing 2x week, and figured out that I could use opiates on a Thursday and be fine by Tuesday morning. And that worked, for nearly 3 months.

Funny thing is, I don‚Äôt even like opiates. I just wanted to use because my life felt like nothing. 


Things started to turn around - I told my coworker I liked him and the feeling was mutual. We went on a few dates and it was amazing (in my mind).


My house manager at my sober house found out about me using so I went back to my moms house which was fine at first, because I was planning on doing that anyway. 


2 weeks ago though coworker broke up with me. I felt blindsided, but I guess there were warning signs. He once said he had commitment problems and also that often got cold feet in relationships and ended up always being the one out first.


I should‚Äôve listened to what he was telling me but I was too wrapped up and falling for him hard (using almost daily now). 


He broke up with me with no chance of returning and all hell broke loose. I just started shoving handfuls of benzos in my mouth. Used up the adderall I had saved, did some lines of dilaudid and heroin because why not? 


Last night I woke up after having passed out in a pool of blood from hitting my head on the toilet coming out of the bath, while high.


I‚Äôm sick of this shit. I don‚Äôt want to lose my job and go back to rehab, but this emptiness and loneliness is too much.",1

I'm retelling it now just to document real experiences and tell a (hopefully) entertaining story.*

So I had just started at the clinic. A friend who was about a month in there had convinced me it was a great move - which wasn't difficult since we had both been sick (literally & figuratively) of going down town every day and getting stomped on trash. For some reason the dope scene had just gone to hell around this time. Of course I had my background user-guilt, but honestly, the bad dope was the only reason at this point... if the heroin had been good we would have kept playing that game. I mean, there was a part of me that wanted to recover, but that part of me was not the part calling the shots.

So I did my last hurrah with the ol' boy, expecting to never feel the rush of a good high again - ever.

I did my intake, passed my test by failing for heroin, and then they gave me my 20mil starter dose. Wow, were we right about the heroin in town being shit! It wasn't our imagination, our tolerance had just gone to shit. I was the highest I had been since we were getting that good from NY or NJ back in the day. On top of being high as fuck it also lasted all day! What a deal for just the cost of two hits!

The next day I went back to the clinic. They asked how I felt and I said ""Great! I'm so happy I made this decision""! I tried to never lie to them. I had a baseline trust that they had this down to a science and I was just on a sort of clinical amusement park ride. Even though I said I felt great they upped me by 5mil on that second dose, with no prompting (or arguing) from me!

The third day was the same... the fourth day another five.... within about a week I had ramped up from 20mil to 60mil. And that's where things got weird. I arrived at the clinic for that 60mil, no doubt obviously high from the previous 55mil dose, and threw back.

I vaguely recall driving home, speaking with my wife before she went to work, turning on the TV to watch some Curb Your Enthusiasm, and then... it's a little hazy.

I came to in the back of an ambulance but I couldn't open my eyes. But let's back up... between loosing consciousness and regaining it I spent quite some indiscernible quantity of eternity flying through these thick clouds, encountering folks from my past, living and dead. Each time it was like moving to a new level in this thickness, breaking through in to something resembling a recreated artificial environment where some weird scenario played out. I wish I had wrote this all down immediately after the experience because I now have only vague memories of what were already vague memories. I do know some of this experience began at my home because it started off incorporating some of the scenes from that episode of Curb; though I quickly penetrated deeper clouds and it became more visceral & personal. The outside world became more distant as I went deeper in to this soul reflecting fog.

So, the ambulance. I woke up and I either couldn't or wouldn't open my eyes. I'm not sure which was the case. I lied there just trying to calmly figure out where I was. I could tell I was in an ambulance, but I didn't have any idea why. My first hypothesis was that I had been involved in some sort of bombing, maybe from a terrorist attack or an ICBM from a rouge nation. I was sure my lower torso was severed or severely mutilated, but I was just glad they had managed to dig me out of the rubble. Then I started to worry about who might not be so lucky and how wide-spread the attack on our land might be. Even after reaching this conclusion I didn't open my eyes. I was just trying to stay calm as I was sure freaking out would be quite terrible for my exposed and protruding organs and lower spine. Turns out it was just that the straps of the stretcher were very tight across my abdomen and legs. Go figure...

Finally I decided to open my eyes and initiate some sort of interaction with the busy voices I heard around me. I don't remember what I said - but they were just trying to get me to shut up and answer one question; ""did you use heroin today""? Hmm, I wasn't quite sure. I thought hard. I thought so hard! I recalled that I, or a past life of mine... or maybe a movie character I had seen had been a heroin user and so I said yeah, that must be it! I was just happy to have noticed that I still had legs and wasn't leaking blood and bile.

This heroin talk was kind of moot anyways, as I later learned they had already administered Naloxone which was probably at that point where was sucked out of those thick clouds of my subconscious mind. By the time we got to the hospital I was just rambling to the medics about how grateful was to them. I think they were getting annoyed but I felt I couldn't adequately express my appreciation to them for having saved my life. 

Once in the hospital they took my clothes off and took all sorts vitals. At this point, as I just sat there in what I imagine is a similar state of mind to a skeptical alien-abductee, I started to think... wow, did I really do heroin today? Didn't I stop that? Yeah! I've been going to the clinic every day! But wait, did I do heroin today too and that's why I'm here? Maybe... No! I know I didn't! This probably took my 20 minutes to work out in my head.

The doctor finally came in the room and I started, as calmly as i could, to explain to him that I had just began the methadone clinic a week ago and I was sure I hadn't done heroin today. His response was ""Okay. Can you tell me what year it is""? That question hit me like a freight train; I had to think so incredibly hard for longer than anyone should, and after starting to utter nineteen ninety something I caught myself and said the correct year. He gave a pretentious nod, a 'checkmate' sort of social queue, and said 'Uh huh'. Then he asked ""Who's president""? Fuck... ""Obama! No wait! Trump""! I said with disappointment (both in myself and the re-realization of the political reality I existed in). Not good. Now, keep in mind this isn't me being dumb, and from talking to others these sorts of questions are standard when you wake from something like this. I'm not sure what value these questions serve, if it's a normal sort of haze to be in, other than to put you a state of mind where you distrust your own thoughts. This guy didn't give a fuck what I said. I was definitely a heroin overdose case. Just a junky going to the clinic and still using.

I insisted on taking a drug test and clearing my name! Even if I wasn't totally sure about the decade or president, I was sure of one thing; I didn't use heroin today! Finally he agreed to let me take a test, with the same smug attitude. After about two hours of waiting for the results (it was a piss test, there's no way it took two hours to get results) a nurse came in and told me it was negative for heroin! Amazing! I was so pleased (and oblivious to the real situation I was in) but I was upset that the doctor didn't come tell me himself and I insisted he return to continue our previous conversation. He was still a dick to me, but this time he asked me about the clinic and I described my first week. He said he was shocked that they had doubled my dose in seven days, but but his face just showed that he had better things to worry about.

Look, I get it... This guy has to save lives of people who aren't actively making decisions that ruin their lives. That trumps me. However, I just didn't want to have 'heroin overdose' in my medical records. This doctor did nothing personally for me, his only purpose in the situation was to come in, prove I was too confused to speak for myself and then add me to the heroin overdose statistics. The ER folks saved me, the nurses made sure I was okay. This doctor had no time for me. But again, I honestly get it. Still, I had been careful as a heroin user (relatively speaking), and while I'd had some close calls I'd never overdosed before in all my years of using! In reality I should have probably just been thinking about how lucky I was to be alive right now, but at this moment all I wanted was to win this battle with this prick doctor and to prove my innocence!

To many people an addict is an addict all the same and all of this might seem petty - but really there are many subtleties to addiction! I needed to know, and to have others know, that I'm an addict that has moved away from needles and heroin and made the move to methadone. That subtle difference, insignificant to most folks, is of the utmost importance in the addicts head. It's similar to the difference between a user that steals from family and one that makes excuses to have them hand over their money... both are shitty, yes, but moving from one to the other can mean all the difference in deciding which direction your life is heading. If people believe I'm using heroin I may as well be using heroin while at the clinic. It's idiotic, but that's the mind of the addict. We need to believe we have won some tiny wars and have some semblance of something that can be construed as 'self-control' if we are to continue to fight!

I think I won that fight, though I'm still afraid to ask about my medical records even years later. I'm sure it says 'heroin overdose' all the same, but if I don't look then the quantum field will not collapse in to a singularity and I can keep on imaging that I won that small battle on that day. 

*This is getting very long and I think I'll save the rest for the next chapter, if anyone is interested in this sort of story telling.*",3

My close friend has been struggling with addiction for a few years. Last week he thought he bought a lot of cocaine (and I mean a lot) but it was mostly ketamine.  Luckily, he somehow made it out of his apartment after blacking out and woke up in the hospital breathing off a tube. He was hard to recognize him when I picked him up from the hospital, his face was so bruised. 

The rest of the story can be discovered in these short films that he is creating to document his path toward recovery. He's a talented film make and I almost lost him last week. Give this a watch if you want to see someone thriving off a new lease on life:

I'm trying to take this seriously. I would say my biggest addiction is to alcohol, but once that barrier has been broken, cigarettes, stims of various sorts (cocaine mostly), various sexual addictions, etc. are all possible. I suppose some of these happen on their own, but getting wasted screws everything up. I am a later 40s male, wasted a lot of years. I was sexually violated as a younger teen. I can see pretty clearly now what happened. As a young adult, memories surfaced and it took me a a few years of hell before I tried to reach out and talk about it, but I kind of got silenced before I could even get it out.

It took me over two more years to try talking about it again, this time with a therapist/counselor I was only able to see a few time before I had to move. I tried reaching out to a therapeutic setting again maybe 6 months later, because things were still really bad. I opened up to the intake person, and felt really good about things. Unfortunately, the person who ended up seeing me was a psychiatrist (think in diagnostic terms), and I got labeled as bi-polar and some other stuff, which turns out to have been totally off - I had trauma. But I didn't know what to do. Anyway, I wasted a crap ton of years not really engaging with life as I am capable off.

I'm actually lucky to be where I at (alive, working an okay job, and still decent health - I eat well and am active), though it still saddens me. But it could be a lot worse. I have screwed up so many times, done some awful crap. Not sure what I am getting at, but I am acknowledging to more than internally just myself that I have had enough of this. As I have said in another post, I can keep on keep as I have, and then get to the end and really flipping hate how this took over my life, or I can start to deal a little bit more and more, and try and shift things a bit in a direction so that when I get to the end maybe I can be at a little more at peace.

I'm a little mad right now thinking about how I got let down in my early to mid twenties, in not being heard. But I will never know how things may have been different, so I know I need to let that go. I am also pretty mad at myself when I think of all the stupid crap I have done. One thing I do know, I am not going to drown myself in drink tonight and escape these feelings. I will sit with them and see what they become. Thanks.",2

2020-04-21 20:47:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g5rhpb/methadone_free_for_four_days_having_second/,"Methadone free for four days, having second thoughts","After more than three years at the clinic I did a slow taper from around over 100mil down to 0 in increments of 1mil every five days. This was the fastest I could convince the clinic to go, as they obviously don't like it when people 'graduate' (yes, I'm jaded ha).

Every time I got to around 100mil I started to have weird issues with anxiety and panic. I don't know if it was real or psychosomatic, but I backed down several times to 80-90 where I would be fine, and then as soon as I crossed 100mil again the symptoms returned. I also couldn't smoke weed at that level of methadone or it was an instant panic attack where I was sure I was about to die - just a weird aside.

Anyways, all of this got old. Real old. I got tired of taking methadone every day... especially when you've been there that long and you don't even feel it... it's just an inverse situation at that point, where you're taking it to not feel bad, and never feel anything approaching good. It was crushing my soul and I was ready to be out of that foul prison of the mind. It was so weird going down though, because it was all fine until around 10-15mil where I started getting high again. I guess it was because that amount wasn't enough to last all day by that point, but I never had wd symptoms until around 4mil. I shouldn't even call it wd, it was really just paws. For about a week I dealt with it but it continued without getting worse or better... just baseline annoying, never full wd.

At this point I wrestled with the idea of ordering some Kratom and finally did. After it arrived I waited another day to take any, out of guilt that I'd be somehow cheating... I'm still unsure if I 'cheated' and feel guilty. I haven't taken more than about 0.5g (a OO cap) twice a day. It's been a while, but if I recall correctly that's a nearly negligible dose of Kratom. I am sincerely trying to be free of these things, not swap addictions.

Anyways, I was feeling pretty great on my last methadone day, last Friday, I even considered that I didn't need to take that last 1mil, but I did, of course. Now, I don't mean I felt 'great' like I was high... no, in that sense I moderately shit as I was still having paws, but that was manageable and I just felt great to be taking my box back to the clinic for the last time to return my bottles! It was liberating and I felt like I had earned some right to say 'I have some willpower! Not much... but I have a little'.

Since that last methadone day I haven't taken more than a around a gram of Kratom in a day, but I still have the paws...  But that's not my main concern, and it would probably be a better question in r/kratom.

(skip to here if tl;dr... it's a little better)

What's really bothering me, though, is that I'm starting to remember why I became an addict... why I started taking Vicodin in my early teens, and later Percocet. I had legit medical issues that were never totally pinned down. I had cluster migraines, arthritis in my fingers, and chronic acid re-flux and ulcerative colitis. I had always assumed that I just outgrew those ailments - even my Asthma (oh yeah, add that to the list)! I hadn't had finger pain, I haven't had to take Prevacid or any antacid, I haven't had debilitating headaches, and I haven't used an inhaler (though I still carry an old and expired one as some sort of weird security blanket, I cannot leave home without it in my pocket). It's been almost 20 years since I've thought about most of these ailments... about half my life. I've been an addict longer, though I didn't recognize it in those pharmaceutical days. So now that I'm (mostly) clean ALL of those things have cropped back up. As I type this I have a mild migraine, fire in my gut and pain shooting thru my fingers as I type... the only thing missing is an Asthma attack. So for the first time in around 20 years I'm having to consider the fact that maybe I wasn't JUST an addict... but an addict that might have actually been successfully self-medicating! A subtle but important distinction, both in my conscience and in how I need to proceed with things.

Of course this sets off alarms in my own head. I'm not new to this game. So before you assume I'm just rationalizing... I'm not! I don't ever want to go on methadone again, let alone anything that led up to that. I want to exercise and play with my kids more and be a better person and save up money and let my wife quit working again... I'm sick of all the bull shit.

But now I'm faced with a dilemma. What's the better way to be whatever 'my best' might be; as a life-long methadone addict or as a recovering person dealing with several painful, stressful and depressing medical issues? I'm not used to reaching out for advice, and I don't even think anyone can give me any real answer here; but I have some hope that there may be wisdom on here and folks who have walked similar paths.",1

I'd like someone to communicate with about addiction who understands what it feels like, so here I am calling out for help. I'm 20 years old and a female, I began taking adderall unprescribed for the hell of it two years ago before my alcoholism started and I fell in LOVE. Obviously turning from a C student to a A student was nice, but I fell in love with the feeling of wanting to do everything at once, feeling empowered, having a flood of euphoria rush into my brain and I never wanted it to go away. It quickly became a everyday thing, I would take 20mg instant release and over some months it increased to 40 mg a day. I also lost 20 pounds and felt so confident and my self confidence skyrocketed. After about a year is when I started to experience the side effects when I would come off of the drug everyday. Heart palpitations, extreme depression when not on the drug, not caring about anyone or anything, constantly feeling numb, panic attacks, I was just miserable after taking it. This didn't stop me though, I'd wake up every day and take it and then end up regretting it towards the end of the day and swearing I would stop because the repercussions were UNBEARABLE. It was this endless everyday cycle that kept on going until I realized I forgot what kind of person I was before I started taking adderall. I quit cold turkey and would stay clean for a couple weeks but crave the rush again and start my using all over again. I have a very addictive personality so whenever I quit adderall, I started to drink. It started off as wine every weekend, and now it's up to 4-5 times a week of drinking equivalent to a whole water bottle full of vodka each day I would plan on drinking. I have no self control I just constantly want to feel something, and I have no pleasure in being sober. My drinking problems have been like this for almost a year, and are not stopping. I'm very into fitness and my self image and this problem has caused me to gain a lot of weight and feel insecure, but that won't make me quit. I got hooked on taking adderall everyday and now I'm hooked on booze. Its getting worse because about one month ago I started to get into a routine, I would take adderall for work.. get my euphoric kick and then to deal with the depression and anxiety, I would drink excessively at night. Shit, I did it yesterday. I just want to be happy without abusing my mental and physical health.. I'm even taking Prozac and Wellbutrin (anti depressants) to help deal with it all but I feel like I haven't even given it a chance because I hardly take them and I'm popping addy's and vodka every other day. I just want help but I hate being vulnerable and I don't like accepting that I have a problem, but this is the first step. I am only happy and interested in doing anything when I'm intoxicated, and when I take my pill. How do I fix this? It doesn't help either that I'm overly impatient.. I've tried quitting and I've seen myself get mentally and physically better but I just end up fucking it up again. I also have a little bit of a eating disorder so that's what I love about adderall's effects.. It's almost as if now I just take it so I won't eat more than 500 calories in a day because I want to lose the weight I'm gaining from the thousands of empty calories in the vodka. I just don't know where to turn to, and would like to talk to others about the hard struggles of addiction, and possibly a way to get better.",6

So 2 weeks after this 4 day binge, I had extreme pains in my left chest area, and then my palms started sweating, I had fluttering and could barely talk and so had to call an ambulance. Couldn't even name my address, my mother helped out and gave me some diazepam drops, which helped me a lot.

The lab found through a blood test that I had highly elevated CK levels of 5400 U/l (normal max being 308 U/l), and elevated AST of 139 U/l (normal max being 37 U/l).

Ever so slightly low haemoglobin, hematocrit and potassium, but it's so slightly below the norm that the doctor told me not to worry about those values. All other values were perfectly within the normal range. Thus, the ER doctor said that I had just suffered a panic attack.

A few days ago, I've visited my family GP, and he told me that upon viewing my blood test results, he realised right away that there were drugs involved. He said he expects that I have cocaine withdrawal symptoms, however, sources on the internet claim that cocaine does not cause such withdrawal symptoms.

Ever since, I get those panic attacks in the evenings (and only in the evenings), accompanied by chest pains, so I wonder what this could be.

This is why I wanted to ask here: Has anyone ever been in the same boat as I am? Are those symptoms normal for cocaine withdrawal (considering that I never had an addiction inasmuch as I never had the urge to buy cocaine myself and only used it when offered by others)? If it is just a panic attack, then how can those elevated values be explained?

I desperately need some words of guidance here, and would be thankful for any input. I am mostly worried about potentially lasting renal, kidney or heart issues that the cocaine might have caused even during this short use because those are not to be joked around with and require immediate medical action.

Furthermore, I had heart issues when I was a newborn, but they fully disappeared when I was 5 years old or so. I will get another blood test at my GP's this Thursday to monitor my levels further, and hope that they are closer to normal by then.",3

I don't know how to help her. If this is wrong sub please direct me elsewhere. I am desperate.,"I apologize about the formatting as I am on mobile and quite upset. I am using a throwaway for privacy. 

As in the title I (F26) suspect that my mother (F47) is addicted and abusing her prescription dilaudid (hydromorphone). 

A bit of background. My mother lives with my husband and I. About 10 years ago she was diagnosed with Lupus, with few other chronic illnesses (rheumatoid arthritis) this leads her to be in a quite high amount of pain. Fairly recently, (last 2 years or so) Her doctor has prescribed her with hydromorphone to keep her pain under control. 

Over the last few months we have come to suspect that she is at the very least misusing her medication if not straight up abusing it. 

Signs which lead us to believe she is abusing her medication:

We hear snorting sounds coming from her room several times a day, several large snorts at a time followed by smaller ones. 

She has nosebleeds on an almost daily basis. When asked about the nose bleeds, she mentions she has ""ulcers"" in her nose causing them to bleed.

 We find bloody q-tips in the garbage. She appears ""high"". Blood shot eyes, pupils don't dilate properly.

she is tired all the time, craving sugar all the time. Passes out various areas in the house, sometimes with blueish lips

 lies about money & asks to borrow money. (She is on disability due to her Lupus)

Her hygiene is deplorable. She will go several days without a shower. She reeks of urine and sweat so badly it lingers on our fabric couch for ages. We have to wash out couch covers/ use fabreeze very often. 

Obviously she needs to get help. She is danger and our lives are miserable living with this. We have no idea how to approach dealing with this situation. 

I appreciate any and all advice.",1

2020-04-20 18:00:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g52bfo/weedgaminglove/,Weed+Gaming+Love,"Hello redditers,

I‚Äôll try to describe the rather difficult situation I am in as short as I can... Well, I (32) live about a year now with my partner (36) a heavy cannabis smoker (about 6-7 joints on daily basis) with successive gaming habits since his childhood. ‚ÄúSuccessive‚Äù meaning he plays daily about 7-8 hours DOTA when I am in home-office mode, when I am not at home he plays‚Ä¶ until I come back. Please keep reading :D

I knew he was a gamer and smoked of course before we moved together, but I didn‚Äôt realize the whole situation. However, after a year of long distance relationship he immigrated to the country I live: he wanted to be with me and develop his career. I believe that his work until then (a crazy well paid home-office job in an international organization) helped him ‚Äúcultivate‚Äù and establish his habits‚Ä¶ seeming normal to the rest of the world: He would work only a few (5-6) days per month and earn fcking lot of money for the average wage there. As he came here, he kept of course his home-office work just to have a backup and search for the vacancies here, learn the language etc‚Ä¶ And after a year here he did exactly‚Ä¶ nothing. He didn‚Äôt even meet another person except my friends and his dealer. Really. Writing this I realize again how crazy this is. At first he said it was the time for integration he needed, then it was the summer-holiday season, afterwards came my pressure and my questions ‚Äúehm don‚Äôt you play too much?‚Äù that destructed him‚Ä¶ then it was suddenly Christmas‚Ä¶ now you can imagine what happens with the lockdown. 

Now everytime I confront the situation he persuades me in the end with his charm and intelligence, that a big part of this situation is my fault: he moved because of me in a city he didn‚Äôt want to, he knows nobody here and I was a monster who was always criticising him and didn‚Äôt support enough. And from time to time I sink in the depression that somebody who lives with a person like this sinks and feel completely devastated, thinking I did all wrong and I really didn‚Äôt support him‚Ä¶

I believe there are a lot of people here, that in one way or another are in similar situations, so we can maybe brainstorm a bit together? Is there any possibility to support a person, who is in complete denial about stopping? In the beginning he was lying to me and his friends who tried to intervate, now he says that he wants to build a functional life and REDUCE the hours and the joints (but not stop for a period and detox) though he has no input except 9gag and YouTube, no hobbies except his computer and found his new explanation, that it is the fault of his girlfriend?

\*Of course I tried already the suggestion to go to therapy, even as a couple, and the answers are balancing between laughing me out about trying to help, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt understand the situation‚Äù and ‚ÄúI cannot afford this‚Äù or ‚ÄúI need to solve other things before, like career etc‚Äù. But still, do you have positive experience with therapy (or no therapy) in this field?

I hope it all makes sense - If you made it till here, thanks for reading people! :)",3

2020-04-20 11:59:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g4vf40/some_clarity/,Some clarity,"This last year has been good to me, in that I have made some positive changes in my life. That said, I have still been feeding my addictions. Maybe it is just me, but I feel like I started getting hit with a lot of clarity this last week or two. I suspect the stay at home and social distancing thing has played a part.

Probably my core addiction is to alcohol. But once I am drunk, I will go out and buy rolling tobacco and smoke like a fiend, also if I can get my hands on certain drugs, I will do them. I have been doing a fair amount of drinking at home lately, something I wasn't doing for a while (for some reason I like to waste money at the bar.) And I can get pretty wasted. A couple weeks ago when drinking I reached out to a connect and bought a gram of coke. I spread it out for a few days, so didn't do all at once. After that I deleted his contact from my phone. That ended the following weekend (so about a week ago) with getting wasted and then waking up and really wanting to take a look at this behavior. This last week was good. Then, as is often the case, I let my guard down Saturday, had a beer at work (there were some in the fridge) and later that lead to a trip to the liquor store for beer. After I starting to drink more, I knew I could find that coke contact buried in a text thread. I found it, he responded, an I ended up with another gram of coke on Saturday. I started up with what was left yesterday and decided to just finish it all so it was gone. On a positive note, after I did the last of it last night, I dug back into the text thread and deleted his contact info from there as well.

Today when I woke up, I got some past self-reflection. I have some traumas from when I was younger. I was very lost for many years, and to be honest I ran from myself. To my credit, I fought to keep my head up and worked and all that. But in truth I was not happy, and I kind of lost myself. I am older now (late 40s), and more recently (last couple of years) that sense of self, in a positive sense, has started coming back to me. That clarity I mentioned these last couple weeks, was seeing my past for what it was. I was seeing who I was, how things evolved, why things happened, etc. For so many years I just couldn't see it. Again, I was lost. The self-reflection this morning had to do with seeing how I was using substances to cope, trying to be somebody when I really had forgotten who that person was. I see that I was chasing after something, but there was no way to get to that something the way I was chasing it.

So, thinking out loud here, what does this mean for me today? I cannot undo the wasted years in the past, I cannot open many of the doors that have closed in my life, there are certain things that are just lost past opportunities. But I can focus on what is here today and what will be there tomorrow. I feel like there is a bit of a crossroads thing going on for me, and I am getting to an age where I really don't want to keep wasting time. I can continue on as I have been, not really happy, not really proud of myself, and I know where that will lead. Or I can make a change for the better. I have regained enough sense of self, that I am no longer wandering around lost. That said, I look at my life, it is like waking up and asking myself ""how did this happen?"" There is a bit of a hole I am in. But first step is to stop digging, then I can start working towards positive change, make something of myself the best I can. Anyway, I wanted to write this down, if for no other reason than to reinforce all this. Thanks.",5

I Desperately Need Help,"TL;DR I'm factually depressed. I'm going to kill myself when I turn 21. I started stealing my sister's prescribed amphetamine pills for her ADHD and they honestly make me a much better person, and they make me genuinely happy. I need help, I don't know what is right.

&#x200B;

A short story of me: Very depressed, on antidepressants, tried to commit suicide many times, you know, the usual. I'm not trying to get attention by saying this or sympathy rather an explanation for my shitty actions.

I started taking my sister's amphetamines (she has ADHD, gets it legally) and it fucks my depression up. It makes me super nice and generous to people, and just generally appreciate life. Antidepressants don't help, weed doesn't, not even mushrooms, the so-called cure for depression. 

This isn't the bad compared to other posts but I feel guilty afterward. I'm stealing from a little fucking girl who needs these to function in school for my own feelings. I can't stop. I am tired of laying around all these years hoping I get better. Just a small dose and I'm normal, productive, kind, just a good person. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to stop. I get addicted to drugs very easily. I thought about finding someone who sells Adderall for a stronger effect but I know if they get laced and I die it will hurt my mom. I'm tired of living my life for myself. Through these pills see everything wrong with me and I changed immediately. Too scared to tell my psychiatrist.

Today I just had the best conversation with my friend because these pills gave me energy and dropped my guard.

&#x200B;

I'm ""high"" right now. I don't want to come down I want to keep taking more. 

&#x200B;

In some ways, I need this off my chest, in other ways I'm reaching out as an 18-year-old dumb kid asking for advice from people with experience and who could share a possible solution. 

&#x200B;

I know a lot of people say they have depression, but I can only admit this is a very serious fucking problem. I can only admit it when I take these pills. I truly believe I won't make it past 21 (My plan is to buy a gun so the failure rate is lower and I won't be kept in a hospital alive against my will). Now that I have taken these, I don't want to fucking die. I want to meet people, explore, live. Cheesy bullshit was sorry. I'm tired of being an introverted ""goth/emo"" who just smokes all day wishing I was dead while lying in bed. 

&#x200B;

Should I just find street Adderall? This might be bad for the normal person but if it means keeping me alive longer, isn't this the healthiest habit I have?

This is my first post in this tread because I recently discovered that my little brother is an addict. A month ago he drove home from college and was acting strange/off. He was slurring his words and his hands were shaking. Each day he got worse and it got to the point that he wouldn‚Äôt respond and would stare at you without really being ‚Äúthere‚Äù. My family and I researched and researched and figured out it probably benzo withdrawal. None of us have had experience with addiction. He told our dad a few months before that he had taken them ‚Äúonce or twice‚Äù. None of us knew how bad it was. We took him to the ER and he was checked in for 3 days. During that I time I had to witness my baby brother withdrawal horribly from these drugs. I had to feed him and help him put on clothes. 

My family and I stayed strong for him but it was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever been through. He is now staying with our parents and staying home because of COVID. We have had a few long talks and it seems like he is on the right path. He is doing online therapy and doing everything out parents are asking him to do. He is wanting to become religious again and help others going through the same thing. I‚Äôm worried about his future and how I can be supportive without enabling. I have had multiple nightmares about seeing him withdraw and about him dying. It‚Äôs on my mind daily. What advice do you have for me to ease my mind and help him too?",1

However, the drinking continued. 

Quarantine: During quarantine a started drinking every day. It was like there was nothing else to do. I woke up and drank until I went to bed. Then I got tempted with coke. One night I was manic and I picked some up. A lot. I‚Äôve been doing coke all day every day pretty much since I‚Äôve been in quarantine. I began losing weight than I already was (which I was sadly happy about because of my eating disorder which also relapsed in). The good thing was I stopped drinking! It was like the cravings were gone. And my boyfriend has been so proud of me. But, he doesn‚Äôt know about the coke use. I‚Äôm so ashamed. I want to tell him so badly.

It was affecting my education, my personal relationships with friends and family, and my state of mind. I went sober to foster a life of healthy behaviors and relationships that didn't have facades between myself and other people. 

Recently it's been really difficult to maintain my sobriety. The longest I've been sober the last 3 years was 2 weeks. It's been almost 16 weeks and I thought after week 12 it would be easy, but it's just getting harder. Everyday I wake up the cravings get more intense and I find myself wanting to drive to the nearest place or person to get something that would make me ""feel"". 

The root cause of my substance abuse is my stress with school, internal issues with my family, and unaddressed trauma I experienced many years ago.

What I'm asking from this post is if anyone has any resource for online therapy or a story they can share about recovery. I feel like I'm in a constant battle with some demon inside me that woke up and does not want to leave no matter how hard I try. I am reaching out for help and I want any help that is offered.

So I have a lot of medical issues and some have left me with chronic pain. I use to take ibuprofen and occasionally Vicodin. Until I got hospitalized because it turns out something in ibuprofen, aleve, Advil, and Vicodin, I think the naproxen has a bad reaction in my body causing internal bleeding and problems with my stomach and intestines. So I can no longer use those to help with my pain. I see many doctors go to therapy, physical therapy, massage therapy, chiropractor, pain management clinic and other things to help with the pain but the only thing that works is my Oxycodone, Baclofen, and hydroxyzine. And I have been on these meds for about 3 years now. I‚Äôve told other people about my meds and they say I should not be taking all these. But they also say that about me taking Ambian. Idk. I‚Äôve talk to my doctor about this especially since my family has had addiction issues. Not my parents but aunts uncles and cousins. In fact one of my uncles was killed by the police because he went on a high rampage. Then his daughter got mixed up with drugs and a drug dealer have multiple kids and her kids became my siblings when my family took them in. Making a house call from me being the oldest of four girls to me being the oldest of eight kids. So especially after all the kids have to come with us I‚Äôve been very anti-drug so much that it took me a long time to even agree to use CBD products because I associate with them with weed and I still consider weed a drug. So I‚Äôve talk to my doctor many Times about my meds especially when she‚Äôs considering upping my dosage. She says I shouldn‚Äôt be so worried I‚Äôm still on the doses of the Oxy. 

One thing with about being on Oxy and not being able to switch it with other meds due to the medical reactions I have. Taking oxy for so long starts to dampen it affects. But since I don‚Äôt want to go up in dosage any more, When I start to realize it‚Äôs not helping I stop taking it except for once a day for 2 to 3 weeks and let myself be in pain so that when I start taking it again it will be effective. 

This is where the issue is starting to be noticed. I just got done doing the three weeks of reduce Oxy and other pain meds down to one pill a day instead of the 3 pills a day like I‚Äôm prescribed. Now that I am taking my normal amount again Not only is it helping a lot more with the pain it‚Äôs also making me very high. And I find myself wanting to take it not only to help with my constant pain but to get high. One of the reasons I do the 2 to 3 weeks of reduced meds is because I am no longer getting any sensation when I‚Äôm taking my meds and I know if I don‚Äôt take them for a while when I start up again I will start feeling the effects like feeling high. 

I really do need them for the pain. I just know I‚Äôm talking them for other reasons too. Idk what to do. We been doing so much to try to deal with my pain in other ways besides the medicine, And I bought so much stuff to use like my tens machine, a massage pillow, special pillows, heat packs, a ton of ice packs, pain relief lotions, and other things. And yes I use these things all the time. But they just don‚Äôt help and that the only way that helps with the med combination I get from my doctor. 

Am I addicted or just overthinking it. What should I do. A big reason I‚Äôm on the meds Is because the issue we believe is causing the pain is from my partial Chromosome deletion. And there‚Äôs not much information on my partial chromosome deletion, it‚Äôs quite rare. And part of the reason it‚Äôs so rare is because 80% of babies who have this from Partial chromosome deletion, Die before birth, Then 80% of those babies Who survived to be born typically day as a baby or toddler. So the fact I am 28 is a miracle but it also means the doctors are used to helping me. Most to have my issue who are alive are typically Severely special needs both mentally and medically. I am definitely very medically affected but besides being high functioning autistic I have most of my mental facilities. Because of all of this doctors aren‚Äôt used to helping people like me which is why I am on so many meds, Because all they know how to do is mask the symptoms but have No clue how to solve the problems. So until science can go farther I am stuck with taking meds so I don‚Äôt want the meds to be taken away. But I do worry we‚Äôre being on these meds for years is starting to leave me. Being on Oxy for three years now is not really what it was made for.",1

2020-04-18 21:36:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g3z8re/i_dont_know_where_to_turn/,I don‚Äôt know where to turn,"Hi,

I‚Äôm looking for some help, I don‚Äôt really know if this is the right place or if there is a better sub to be on, I posted in NA too.

I have a disability that results in both acute and chronic pain, and mental health issues. I‚Äôve used (prescribed) opiates for around 15 years, historically when I was having bad flare ups rather than all the time which I think is how I avoided addiction for so long. When I felt like I was taking too many I would quit cold turkey to prove I wasn‚Äôt addicted and never had too many issues doing so (except the increase in pain). I thought I was safe.

A year and a half ago I had a pain flare up that lasted much longer than usual, and resulted in taking opiates every day. The next time I tried to quit.... I couldn‚Äôt.

Whilst the quantities I‚Äôm taking are mostly within the limits of what I‚Äôm prescribed (low end of a high strength painkiller) and my drug use doesn‚Äôt cause problems with my day to day functioning, I know I am an addict. I know I take my painkillers for reasons other than acute pain - when my body hurts a mild/moderate amount but my mind is in distress. I use it to numb me because I don‚Äôt have a better way to deal with my mind (I‚Äôm on two antidepressants and have weekly therapy and try and practice mindfulness so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not trying.) I use them to relax.... which is not what they‚Äôre for.

The issue I mostly struggle with is I can quit for a short period - I don‚Äôt get physical withdrawal symptoms other than feeling wound up and tense because of cravings. But often true, legitimate pain causes me to need to take a painkiller and then I‚Äôm back to square one, taking them all the time again for the easy way out. Each time it gets harder to quit and each time I quit the clean period seems to last a shorter period of time.

I don‚Äôt know where to go or who to turn to. If I go to my dr I risk the painkillers I need to function being completely removed, I would be very concerned about using local charitable services as I work in the charity sector in the borough I live in and everyone knows everyone. I don‚Äôt know much about NA and have been too scared to go but as I understand it clean is clean, there isn‚Äôt a middle ground and that‚Äôs what I struggle with most. Whilst I use the painkillers in a way I shouldn‚Äôt and feel out of control of my use of them I also know that not having them at all would make my life infinitely harder when I‚Äôm in genuine pain. I want to quit abusing painkillers whilst being able to use them sensibly and responsibly.... is that something I could ever be capable of?

I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt know where to turn to, I hate myself for feeling so weak and I feel like I‚Äôm watching my future spiralling away. I‚Äôm scared and embarrassed and I know I need help.",2

2020-04-18 04:24:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g3k5rb/one_half_sober/,One half sober,"I‚Äôm a very new reddit user, so I‚Äôm likely going to make a bunch of mistakes.
I do not give consent for my post to be used anywhere.

My SO (m45) and I (f37) are both reformed addicts.
From the sound of his history he hit things pretty hard and had progressed to using needles.
Both of us spent years using drugs on and off (mostly on)
We both cleaned up about 5 years ago and as far as I‚Äôm aware there have been no slips.
But honestly I‚Äôm not sure, he doesn‚Äôt give me the impression that he has made any recovery other than not using.
While we didn‚Äôt get any counselling or assistance, I did jump online to read about addiction and how relapse might work with the intention of making sure I stay clean.
He on the other hand refused discussions around it, or proclaimed his absolute certainty he would never relapse, or become highly defensive and argumentative when I would pull him up when I could see him walking down the path.
He has an oddly addictive personality that he refuses to address... it‚Äôs not just highs.
Last year I had to pull him up because he started drinking, at first it was one at one special dinner, then it was 2 at the next special dinner, then it was just because we were out to a general dinner, then it was a good deal on takeaway, which let‚Äôs be honest he couldn‚Äôt have seen that deal unless he went into the shop with the intention of coming out with something.
I also had to pull him up on using my essential oils all the time, these are natural but potent, over use is a bad thing, not to mention helichrysum is expensive.
Then he started excessively using hand sanitiser (remember this was last year when sanitizer was no more of a thing than the year before).

Last month he acquired cannibis oil... actually his friend gave it directly to me thinking I knew about it.
The idea he had was to make edibles for his mum to help with her dementia.
We had discussed it in the past, but that was medical grade oil, not this stuff that was handed to me.
We discussed it again and I almost fell for it, but his face lit up when he started talking about how we need to try the edibles first to make sure they weren‚Äôt too strong for her. I put my foot down and disposed of the oil.

Yesterday he hurt his back by twisting the wrong way, I‚Äôm sure it hurt quite badly so he needed rest painkillers and fluids. It‚Äôs perfectly fine today so it wasn‚Äôt a serious injury, just a really bad pain that impacted his function for an afternoon.
A friend of his who is under pain management for their degenerative disease offered him an opioid.
Thankfully, he asked me if he should accept and of course I said no, your an addict, you can‚Äôt ever take anything like that without risking relapse.

You would think I‚Äôm greatful that he was honest with me but here‚Äôs the thing, it tells me that he is still not taking responsibility for his own sobriety. It scares me that he will continue these ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô checks and one will eventually slip by me, like it did when he started drinking, like it almost did when he tried to convince me that we try edibles for his dying mum.
It angers me that if one slips by me that I need to become the bad guy again and it hurt me to deal with his pushback and anger when I had to pull him off the drinking path.

And mostly, it terrifies me that we now have a child and if anything happened to me, he would no longer have his checks and balances in place (being me) to hold him accountable for his sobriety while he is charged with single parenthood.

He is currently angry with me now because I told him all this.
As far as he is concerned I can‚Äôt possibly know if he will ever walk the path again, because that story isn‚Äôt written yet, and until it is I will never know, so right now I‚Äôm just being controlling, like his parents were (manipulation much?)

But he is acting and talking like someone who has a strong potential, and he‚Äôs refusing to take any action to deal with his constant desire.
He says it‚Äôs still there, all the time, and he is easily triggered, but he thinks this is fine because he decided never to relapse again.

I obviously can‚Äôt speak for everyone that has experienced the path from addiction to sobriety, but I don‚Äôt feel desire now, ever, and whenever I‚Äôm exposed to a potential trigger there is no spark of desire at all, in fact I feel disgusted by the idea of using or drinking anything. If someone offers me anything that could be a risk to relapse I don‚Äôt need to check with anyone first, my answer is a direct no.

Even so, I don‚Äôt think for a minute that the potential for me isn‚Äôt there, I believe I need to always consider myself an Addict (though reformed) because one slip could be all it takes to send me back.

He doesn‚Äôt consider himself an addict, some days he does, but when he‚Äôs been exposed to a trigger and has a stronger desire, he denies he is an addict and that he just enjoys a drink, or needs pain relief, or just wants to have fun, or is doing it to help others.

I don‚Äôt know where to go from here, especially during a time when it‚Äôs not easy to just go out and seek help due to pandemic restrictions...",1

they dont have health insurance, cant afford a private plan, and do not qualify for public health insurance. getting them to go to meetings or treatment voluntarily is very unlikely. we do not live together, and we both work full time (both essential workers), so i have no way to monitor their environment or alcohol intake except for when we are together, which is rare right now. 

i have gone over all of my options in my head probably hundreds of times in the last few days. if i leave them, it could be a wake up call, or it could make it worse and speed up the whole process. if i stay, am i just enabling them? i have no idea what to do. i dont even know where to start... 

i work in the behavior therapy field, and have dealt with addiction (myself and in my family) my whole life, but i have never encountered anything like this before, and  especially not with someone who i am this close to. 
any advice or support is welcome right now.",3

I didn't smoke for a week when I was 17 because I felt a slight craving for it and thought that it has to stop. Then I stopped smoking for a week or two now and then, it happened about 3 times. Then in January 2020 I had a tonsillectomy so I had to stop smoking for 3 weeks and I didn't crave it. But I went back cause it's a nice feeling sometimes and I was having good conversations while doing it. Then coronavirus and quarantine came and I stopped smoking. In the last 5 weeks I have smoked about 5 cigarettes altogether, when I went on walks. I do not have a craving.

I have been wondering for some time whether this is normal? I also drink a lot of alcohol at parties and I never feel the urge to drink at other times.",1

I don‚Äôt eat until the hunger start to hurt my stomach and I don‚Äôt feel the effects of nicotine at all anymore yet I still crave the drug. I also get massive headaches for hours everyday.  I‚Äôve been smoking weed about a year but I now use multiple times a day every day and can barely feel effects anymore. I have very bad anxiety and depression, I used to take anti depressants and they made me feel awful. At some point I figured out if I smoked whenever I felt stressed or like I was going to freak out I‚Äôd feel way better. About 9 months ago my depression was bad, rarely left my bed room, slept through the day, so my parents gave me an ambien once to help me sleep just a couple hours earlier to get back to a normalish sleep schedule. I didn‚Äôt fall asleep, I stayed awake through the effects and it felt amazing. I managed to steal more, and had used it and eventually forgot about it. 

A while back I stole some more, and now that I can‚Äôt really feel the effects of the drugs I use I feel like I almost crave how I felt on ambien. I have held onto the two I stole for almost two months just thinking about using them, unable to get rid of them with my own self will. Every high I‚Äôve felt I feel I always crave it again, whether it‚Äôs being drunk, high, buzzed, or whatever, I always want more and I want it stronger. 

I‚Äôve never had a serious problem with a hard drug but I feel I might fall into it, and my current use of nicotine and weed is already really unhealthy. I‚Äôd ultimately like to quit nicotine because I realize even when I take a break for a day to feel the effects, it still takes a ton of holding in big hits to feel anything, to the point where it makes me so sick I cannot even stand. I do like weed and understand healthy use is fine but I need to learn what that‚Äôs like. I don‚Äôt know what to do, I know quitting nicotine is a nearly impossible task, I will always crave it and it‚Äôs way too easy for me to get. Eventually I‚Äôll run out of weed (quarantine) and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll end up taking the ambien as the only thing stopping me now is that it‚Äôs in my car. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to go about not ruining my own life by continuing to believe it isn‚Äôt a big deal, because I fear it‚Äôll become one.",3

Has anyone had lasting damage from use and is it manageable/treatable?,"I am a 27/f Canada, 5‚Äô1‚Äù and 105 pounds for reference.

I was introduced to coke just over a year ago through my bf and have been using maybe up to 4 times a month, typically long into the night. I don‚Äôt know exactly how much I use but would say I do 2-3 lines an hour for up to 8 hours at most sometimes. I‚Äôd say half the times I‚Äôve used I was drinking as well which I know is terrible. Last July (6 months into this type of use) I had an ECG done as part of another checkup and my doctor said there was something unusual about the result, something about q-waves. She said they sometimes see that in people who have had a heart attack but I haven‚Äôt had one so she said she wouldn‚Äôt worry too much. I didn‚Äôt think too much of it and my specialist who was supposed to review the result seemed to have forgot to bring it up during my appointment and she‚Äôs retired now. (I am also terrified of bringing this up to any doctors for fear of discrimination from future healthcare providers. I‚Äôm in a helping field and may want to do post-grad but don‚Äôt know if future employers have the right to have access to drug use history.)

I am in a state of panic right now because I‚Äôm reading more about coke and heart damage. While I knew it was a huge risk, because I wasn‚Äôt using daily I didn‚Äôt think it would catch up to me like this. A few days ago I was laughing really hard about something (like a can‚Äôt catch my breath type of laugh) and noticed a sort of pressure or pulling on the left side of my chest which eventually dissipated after I stopped laughing and calmed down. This is when I became especially concerned. I looked into anginas and it seems like this could potentially be one except the ache was only in a specific area centre-left of my chest and I didn‚Äôt have the pain that supposedly goes down the left arm or anywhere else.

Can someone please tell me if any damage I could have caused is reversible? Does it sound like I could have a heart attack any moment? I know I‚Äôm an idiot, know I need to stop. I‚Äôm not reliant on it to function but my boyfriend is an addict and sometimes I end up using with him.

I send him messages to his Facebook that he hasn‚Äôt logged into for months hoping when he does he see‚Äôs pictures of my baby. His grandchild. 

I have so much hurt in me sometimes I wish he had just died before using drugs because it hurts to know he is hurting and can‚Äôt shake the addiction.  * I don‚Äôt really wish he was dead* I just wish he was here with us... emotionally and mentally.

I've been closer with my family than ever before and they are scattered throughout the country! Coming clean to them when I popped was a real wake up call. 

The best part about losing everything is learning how to work up to becoming better through the experience. I may be losing my job now, but through this sober experience and knowing I'll forever be an addict is one hell of an adventure only a few of us can share! I want to be somebody! I wasted too much time being a stoner or too high to feel my teeth or too drunk to remember who I was. for too long was I caught up on self victimizing and playing a pity party.

Even if people call me a loser or talk smack about me, I know I'm working on becoming better than I ever was, and that's something nobody has over me! 

I felt a surge reading some of these posts and I truly hope that y'all make it. It is incredibly difficult at times and learning how to live a new life is never easy, especially for the vets, but we can do it. Easy does it and let's take this one day at a time.

God (or whomever your higher power is) bless!

He is currently 17 and I am worried about him. About a year ago, we had smoked weed together, and he mentioned he had done xanax. It turns out he was addicted to painkillers as well and I told his mom, and she got him to go to rehab. I guess she blames me for it, as she has held a grudge against me (I have done some things, but only psychedelics and weed, and I have tried to discourage him from this stuff). While he told me that he had cleaned himself up after he got back, but I see his snapchat stories and he is still definitely doing various substances (likely xanax or molly). He and his family are no longer in my life, but I am worried about him. His mother also tends to overreact and make rash judgements, so I cannot be sure how she would react if I told her. Along with this, the quarantine makes things worse, as going to rehab right now is barely an option, and it would likely make their whole family dynamic much worse, which I'd feel bad for. Plus, if he's already been to rehab once, how much will it really help a second time? Any and all advice for what to do would be greatly appreciated.",3

I thought I‚Äôd just share my thoughts on how I‚Äôm feeling in regards to my past addictions 
So I was essentially a drug addict since I was very young (started at twelve years of age) 
It first started smoking weed and drinking with my mates and over the years turned into basically every drug other than meth and heroin. I left school when I was fifteen and got a full time job and would work six days a week and would blow the whole pay check on a cocktail of drugs, this went on up until I was twenty years old and decided one day I‚Äôve had enough and quit everything that same day.
I‚Äôve been sober for a very long time but one thing I regret is going out with friends to have a good night and watch them pull out a bag of coke or mdma mid way through and see them enjoying themselves with no toxic history behind it and genuinely just have fun in the moment and wake up the next day with no thought of taking more for months knowing if that was me I‚Äôd be calling my dealer the next morning for more. 
Sometimes I‚Äôll be visiting my brothers for dinner and a movie and they will pull out a joint to lighten up the mood and knowing I can‚Äôt participate because one joint never stays to just one joint. 
Honestly all the money spent over the years all the moments in life I missed to do drugs all the relationships I ruined I got past but I genuinely wish i could just clear any memory of my previous addiction and be able to just take substance once a year just to have a good time but clearly that will never be the case. It feels great to be sober and actually have a savings account or be able to take things seriously and be taken seriously but every now and then it would be nice to just just roll up a joint put my feet up and just drift off for a few hours. 
Any way I‚Äôd love any advice or others to share their experiences as it always helps to hear from others than are also in the same boat 
Cheers for reading

24 hours in.

It really goes hour.... by hour... 

The flu like symptoms and restlessness is unimaginable but I‚Äôm gonna keep managing and push through.

I am addicted to lying.

It started off as nothing when I was about 4 or so I'd just embellish things like when the teacher asked what I did over the weekend I'd say that something amazing happened instead of me just playing basketball with my brother.
It got worse at the age of 8, I started making up friends and telling my real friends about them but never mentioning they weren't real. I got really good at lying. Like too good.
I started lying to friends, teachers, family, strangers etc. And I felt like shit but couldn't stop.
I felt awful, I feel awful some of my friendships are built on lies and I cant come to terms with telling them that I've been lying this entire time. I've stopped talking about the made up friends, I've stopped logging into the made up profiles of people who dont exist and I've managed to catch myself in a lie a few times.

I'm trying so hard to stop and I know this is all self inflicted, I'm worried when I start trying to date people I'll lie to them, when I start college I'll lie to all the new people, I'm scared that this will go too far than just a white lie or an embellishment.

It's already gone too far.

So from this day 15/4/2020 I will battle my addiction,  my life may be boring but it wont be a lie.",3

Just hoping it won't backfire.,"I got a chance to reach my home on the 21st day of lockdown (in my country). From here, it‚Äôs 20 days more (at least) living in the lockdown with zero accessibility to weed (I don‚Äôt do any other form of substance abuse. Not even cigarettes). And that will be the longest period of time, I will be sober in the last 4 years or so. During these four years, it has been in-between ‚Äòat least one joint for the day‚Äô and at most, well can‚Äôt count that, can we? Even after this lockdown started, weed and work-from-home were going hand-in-hand. 

Currently, I am going through a spree of self-improvement initiatives and I always knew, if I have to improve my social and time management skills, I have to stop being dependent on an unmonitored substance. I guess this was the sign of the universe, which said, ‚Äúwe are going to give you a choice. And from here on, you won‚Äôt be allowed to blame anyone else or any external factor.‚Äù I added the last part myself and the universe is fine with it. It sounds complete and threatening, now. Anyhow, if I am able to come out alive from this, than‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt decided on a reward yet.
I know it from the experience, that the first 3-4 days are the toughest one. Maybe, that‚Äôs why I am a little confused, edgy, and anxious as of now. I hope this fades away soon, without belittling my emotional maturity, I am so proud of.",2

Please help.,"I know it‚Äôs not as serious as other substances, like drugs and alcohol, but it has ruined my life. I wake up, watch, eat, watch, sleep, repeat. I would even watch while peeing/pooing and while bathing (I rarely take showers and usually baths now to watch) AND EVEN WHILE IM DOING HOMEWORK AND STUDYING. My day revolved around watching as much as possible. 

I craved TV starting around 8-9 years old. However my parents were able to put restrictions and I had an active imagination so I would play with my friends and toys. As I grew older, I found ways to go around these restrictions, especially with YouTube and how I would spiral down videos for hours. 

Soon I realized I would be angry while conversing with others because I wasn‚Äôt watching TV. I would take it out on my friends and family. Soon, my I became friendless and I alienated myself from my family. 

I used to be a grade A+ student until junior year of high school, the most important year for college. I would watch ALL THE TIME, and I soon began getting Bs and Cs. It cost me my track to a great college. 

I also realized in social gatherings, I felt as though I was putting on a mask to fit in. I acted in a way that did not reflect my personality mostly because I did not know how I would respond. I felt emotionless. I don‚Äôt feel human anymore. 

I have told my parents about it, but they say something along the lines of ‚Äújust stop‚Äù or ‚Äúdo something else.‚Äù When I‚Äôm watching and they tell me to do something more productive or more fulfilling, I would make excuses and lie, saying I was doing a lot of work or something. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here haha. 

The problem is, I love TV and movies. It makes me feel great joy, laugh, and really think about certain topics. Some of my fondest memories, sadly, are watching Avatar the Last Airbender (a show I want to show my children if I can find someone to love and who loves me), laughing while watching Parks and Rec, the Office, and Community, and cheering while watching Marvel movies and contemplating societal infrastructure after watching Parasite. Furthermore, TV and movies are engrained in culture, like the phenomenon with Game of Thrones and Avengers Endgame. I know it is ruining my life, and I‚Äôm not doing anything meaningful with my life, but I truly love watching TV and movies. But do I really enjoy it if I experience such pain when I‚Äôm not watching?

I really need help, even if it‚Äôs from strangers. Is it possible to find a balance, or will I have to cut it out of my life completely, if that‚Äôs even possible in today‚Äôs society? What should I do to achieve this balance/no TV? How do I stop letting TV control me and truly become happy and fulfilled?",3

Also , I want to specify that your name/address is not requested, and the rest - basic (age , sex,etc. ) - information will remain strictly confidential.

If I get enough participants, and you guys request it, I could maybe ,at the end of the research, interpret the results of the tests,and maybe send them to you individually or something.

I've reached a point where I can say I have a problem and I need to seek help.  have an addiction to MDMA and weed. I'm a 35 year old male, I'm an IT consultant by profession and my wife is a doctor. 

I was introduced to it by my wife when we were still dating. 

We are fresh into our marriage (2 years) but we have known each other for over a decade. Luckily she still has a job but I have no been able to find anything and I've hit a quite a depressing low. I have been laid off for a year and a half now and it's been tough on my mental state. I started using mdma and smoking pot a lot while being laid off to cope with my sad moods all the time.

I feel like absolute shit that i let it get this bad (or even start), while my wife is slaving away Im getting fucked up at home.  feel pathetic. I don't want to tell her in fear of ruining my marriage so I am reaching out here.

I want to do better for my wife. Please offer me some wisdom.

Thank you!",1

I currently live with the person I relapsed with (he was clean for 9 or 10 months as well). Sorry in advance for the grammar..

Question 1:

What alternatives are out there for Programs besides the 12 Steps?

I had a some good progress with some of the Steps, Steps 4 and 5 were eye opening, and Step 10 has been helpful but overall I couldn't  get behind believing in the spirituality aspect of the throughout the 12 steps. Hell I got into arguments in group several times and almost left a couple times as I felt the spirituality part was being shoved down my throat as an aesthetic plus I'm stubborn as a mule. I'm thinking I need to start attending meetings again, find activities to keep my busy, and communicate with people  who care are in my life. I'm not sure if I do another 3 to 4 month program again at the moment.

&#x200B;

Question 2:

Should I move out? I'm on the fence about it.  I think I just need to have a good heart to heart with him about everything before giving up on our friendship.

Question 3:

Should I tell my parents? 

They are a huge part of my life, and I discovered through therapy (before going to Treatment) that when they moved away to retire that it was one of my many triggers that started my addiction with drugs. They were heart broken when I first told them I had problem before going to rehab but they have been as supportive as they from across the country. The main reason I don't want to tell them is because they already worry about me 24/7, think I'm going die everyday even before I relapsed, they have no trust in me. As I'm typing out my reasoning, I think their just excuses and I'm more afraid than anything of losing them.

&#x200B;

I'm looking for suggestions and to hear from people about experiences with their relapses and what they did to recover. 

Before I started writing this post I had a bunch of questions, which I now can't think of. Hell I even feel better after writing all this out to be honest. Thanks in advance!",2

I am in desperate need of help or advice. I‚Äôve gotten myself into some shit and I‚Äôm at a loss on how to fix myself.

I‚Äôll try to keep it short and to the point.

A couple of months ago, I got myself hooked on opioids. I went from 10 mg a day for a few months, to 50 mg a day for a month and I am trying so desperately to quit. I‚Äôm currently taking about 10 mg a day to wean off of it. 

This is something that I am absolutely not able to share with anyone except for my best friend. 

I am SO ready to leave this all behind but I have  failed all of my previous attempts at stopping. I‚Äôm scared, I borderline can‚Äôt handle the feeling of withdrawal. The restless nights, the unbearable anxiety, the loss of joy in everything. People I‚Äôve talked to said you just have to push through but I‚Äôm just not strong enough. 

Rehab isn‚Äôt an option, but I would go willingly if I could. 

Please, any advice, any words of encouragement, any past experiences that you can share with me to help me. I am desperate..

Self-harm became my daily routine
For in ruins was my self-esteem
There were so many days I wanted to reach out
But seeds you sewed so deep in doubt
Of my mind you had complete control
My innocence you stole
He preyed on my secrets to make me feel shame
Until in the mirror I could never look at myself the same
The pain cut so deep
At night I was afraid to sleep 
He made me believe I could not live without him
My future once bright had become so dim
I couldn‚Äôt see an end to the pain
Under your spell I believed I‚Äôd always remain
How could someone you love hurt you like this
I should‚Äôve tasted the deceit in your kiss
Never again will you hear me say I love you
Or walk down the aisle and say I do
For the day came I finally was able to escape
And truly accept our fate
I would‚Äôve loved you threw the war
But now without you I can truly soar
It‚Äôs time I finally say good bye

Ive been hospitalized a few times in my life, amd each time was paid for by the state because of my circumstances.

I once wwnt to a crisis center in my area, that i know for sure takes both people in rehab and people in mental health crisis..... but that place was literally hell on earth, I was traumatized by my stay in that place, and I will mever go there again. Ever.

I may be leaving the state in a few months to live with a friend. Do I wait until I leave to state to seek help so i cant possibly be forced back into that horrific nightmare of a crisis center?

If I understand it, a countervailing affective process B is generated in response to process A, the initial neural response to a stimulus such as a narcotic. 

The brain adapts to the stimulus and generates an increasingly strong opponent process as the nervous system seeks to impose transience on any sustained feeling that could peturb the brain's neutral state.

Withdrawal is this countervailing b process outlasting the drug's effect.

My question is; why isn't the state of withdrawal itself not counteracted naturally by the addicted subject's brain if it is so sensitive to peturbation? Surely, withdrawal could eventually be interpreted as a sustained negative peturbation of the base state?

I am at a place where I want to turn certain aspects of my life around. I'm not ""in the gutter"" so to speak, I have been a somewhat functional addict, though if I am honest with myself, I have not lived up to my potential. There is also a pretty dark secret side to my life that others just don't see or know the depths of. I know I have personal demons I have tried to numb and escape from. And in the numbing and escaping, I have created more personal demons. It is a bad cycle that I want to get out of. I am too old for this, and I feel like I am getting at an age where there is a bit of a crossroads, and I need to decide where I am going to head from here. I am further along this life's path than I'd like to admit, and ignoring life like I have in many ways so far starts to look a little grim.

In regards to the regrets, I can get pretty bummed out over all the doors that have closed in my life over time, whether because of any direct action on my part, or even more so inaction. I was helpless with my stuff for so long, in many ways I just skated through life, not actively engaging being the person I would have wanted to be. There is some background trauma that I feel drove a lot of this. I know I have to do a lot of work on acceptance, I need to make good choices, and I need to start focusing more on the doors that are open for me in the present. They are there, but I will not lie, I get really stuck on what I missed out on. This is a big one for me.

In regards to resentments, and what brought me to post this, I just got very triggered thinking about family resentments. I have gained a lot of clarity in my life as to how everything unfolded, why things were the way they were. There is some anger there. Again, I need to work on acceptance, and I need to get more in the present, making my life more worthy of one worth living going forward.

I am not sure what else to add, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I want to think a little more about how regrets and resentments play into my addictive behaviors. I see how easy I can spiral down these emotional holes, and then I want to get away from that place they put me in. I hopefully am learning, and hopefully I will keep doing the work to do better.

2020-04-13 14:42:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/g0oy9l/psa_these_things_have_clinical_evidence_of/,PSA: These things have clinical evidence of upregulating/repairing dopamine receptors and curbing cravings.,"Posted this on /r/pornfree recently related to repairing dopamine receptors. Thought it might be useful here too.

A common question while attempting to quit an addiction is how to ‚Äúboost dopamine‚Äù levels. We‚Äôre usually actually more concerned with *upregulating* (repairing) dopamine *receptors* after addiction, specifically D2 receptors, that have been beaten down over the years. Boosting dopamine *initially* is still important though; more on that below. The following things have clinical evidence of upregulating dopamine receptors.

**Obligatory preface and disclaimers:**

* First, the most important piece of the healing process is obviously still abstaining from the addictive behavior itself.
* Secondly, this is admittedly a simplistic, reductionistic view of the healing process and of the dopaminergic system itself. I acknowledge that dopamine, while it does seem to be the primary aspect of the neurobiological processes involved, is only *one* aspect. There are obviously more complex mechanisms at play with different neurotransmitters, regions, and pathways in the brain.
* Similarly, these things - and simply upregulating dopamine receptors - may not necessarily speed up the recovery process as a whole, though they *should* help alleviate symptoms, curb cravings, help you feel better, and at least speed up the repair of the dopamine receptors *per se*.
* I‚Äôm not a medical doctor. This is not professional medical advice and should not be substituted for professional medical advice. Ask a doc before combining these with any prescription drugs you‚Äôre on, as they may be contraindicated, especially dopamine agonists and NDRI‚Äôs like Levodopa, Adderall, Ritalin, etc.
* Everything here is backed by scientific research. There‚Äôs a link to 116 research studies at the end.

**Assumptions, most of which are the foundational neuroscientific understanding of addiction plus recent advancements:**

* We know that spiking dopamine - both acutely and chronically - from things like porn, gambling, junk food, drugs, etc. leads to the desensitization and downregulation (decrease in sensitivity and number) of dopamine receptors, especially in the context of extreme, artificial stimuli, and especially with things that *persistently* increase dopamine levels, like cocaine.
* We know that low dopamine is associated with low energy levels, lack of focus and motivation, poor learning and memory, symptoms of depression, apathy, anhedonia, and reward-seeking behavior.
* We know that the addiction model appears to be largely the same for *behaviorial* addictions as it is for *chemical* addictions, and share many of the same neurobiological mechanisms and alterations in the brain.
* Recent developments in neuroscience seem to agree that the dopaminergic system is involved in the *want* or *desire* of the pleasure/high, *not* necessarily in the *pleasure itself*, which is delivered via the opioid system, among other things. Interestingly, that *desire* can be chemically stronger than the pleasure received, thus the addiction.

**So here‚Äôs the list:**

* **Uridine** \- found naturally in human breast milk and oddly, in beer. Lots of anecdotal evidence for uridine helping people quit smoking. I prefer triacetyluridine, which is more bioavailable than uridine monophosphate. Main component of the famous ‚ÄúMr. Happy Stack.‚Äù
* **Forskolin** \- usually supplemented for its potential fat burning effect. Make sure you're getting a standardized extract.
* **Sulbutiamine** \- two thiamine molecules and a sulfur group. Modulates the dopaminergic, cholinergic, and gluatmatergic transmission systems.
* **Inositol** \- natural B vitamin (B8). Involved in communication between neurotransmitters. Often used in high doses alongside medications to alleviate symptoms of depression, OCD, panic attacks, and anxiety.
* **CDP-Choline** \- Found naturally in the body. Precursor to acetylcholine, and is necessary for proper brain function. It is often supplemented to prevent memory impairment associated with aging.
* **ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine)** \- acetylated version of the amino acid Carnitine. While usually used as a pre-workout supplement, ALCAR has plenty of evidence showing its neuroprotective, neuromodulatory, and neurogenerative effects, as well as its ameliorative effects on memory and learning in cases of cognitive impairment, brain injury, or cognitive decline due to aging.
* **Cordyceps** \- It‚Äôs a mushroom. It exerts antidepressant and anti-fatigue effects via upregulation of D2 dopamine receptors and enhancing the expression of the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine-hydroxylase that converts L-tyrosine to L-DOPA. Aim for a whole fruiting body extract (as opposed to myceliated grain) from a reputable source like Real Mushrooms, Freshcap, or Nootropics Depot.
* **Meditation** \- While no studies currently show specific influence on dopamine *receptors*, a handful of studies do show a reliable increase in striatal dopamine release, increasing levels of circulating dopamine. Meditation may not provide a lasting effect on receptors *per se*, but it gets an honorable mention here because it may offer at least a temporary relief for symptoms of low dopamine levels like anhedonia, lack of motivation, low energy, etc. (think ‚Äúflatline‚Äù).
* **Exercise** \- Similar to meditation, exercise seems to modulate the dopaminergic system and increase levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, among its myriad other health benefits.
* **Sunlight** \- Similarly, sunshine exposure seems to increase dopamine synthesis, providing ameliorative therapeutic benefits for those who suffer from seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and depression. Sunshine exposure appears to modulate and enhance the dopaminergic system as a whole and was shown to increase striatal D2 and D3 dopamine receptor availability. These effects may be secondary to blue light simply regulating circadian rhythms, but it also appears that neurotransmitters themselves also follow a circadian rhythm independent of light‚Äã‚Äã. It‚Äôs unclear if artificial blue light devices exert these same effects on the dopaminergic system, though they *do* seem to have positive effects on the serotonergic system.

**Alleviating symptoms, decreasing urges, and feeling better**

Broadly speaking, things that *increase* dopamine (agonists) generally downregulate/decrease receptors. Things that *decrease* dopamine (antagonists) generally upregulate/increase dopamine receptors. The brain tries to achieve homeostatic balance.

It may sound counterintuitive, but I would argue it may be prudent to actually mildly *boost* dopamine during the initial stages after quitting. People experiencing the aforementioned symptoms of low dopamine levels are *more likely* to re-engage in the addictive behavior. On the flip side, if you feel good, you are more likely to stay the course in your abstinence/recovery. Moreover, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels of circulating dopamine should translate into less reward-seeking behavior.

Recent research from 2015 seems to agree. From Kenneth Blum et al, the addiction expert researchers who originally *discovered* the genetic connection to decreased dopamine receptors in the early 1990‚Äôs and coined the term ‚ÄúReward Deficiency Syndrome‚Äù (RDS): *‚Äúwe argue that a more prudent paradigm shift should be biphasic‚Äîshort-term blockade and long-term upregulation, enhancing functional connectivity of brain reward circuits.‚Äù*

So how can we do that? By laying foundational support for the dopaminergic system and the neuroplasticity-inducing processes that are slowly repairing the pathways of the addicted brain during abstinence, and by doing what we can to curb cravings.

* **Fish oil** \- supports brain health and may have ameliorative effects on symptoms of depression. As part of the famous ‚ÄúMr. Happy Stack‚Äù (DHA/EPA, uridine, and choline), it has evidence of promoting the actual growth of neurons and synapses between neurons.
* **L-Tyrosine** \- the amino acid precursor to dopamine and catecholamines. Essentially, no tyrosine = no dopamine. Tyrosine converts to L-DOPA which converts to dopamine. I would **not** recommend supplementing L-DOPA (typically from mucuna pruriens) directly; you‚Äôd be bypassing the rate-limiting step and increasing dopamine indiscriminately, thereby downregulating dopamine receptors and depleting serotonin in the process over the long term, which works precisely *against* what we‚Äôre trying to achieve during the healing process. L-DOPA supplementation is also associated with mania, dyskinesia, psychosis, homicidal thoughts, and a range of other nasty side effects. If you‚Äôre eating a high-protein diet, you may be have enough tyrosine already, as tyrosine is found in high concentrations in meat, dairy, beans, nuts, and seeds. But this makes it arguably more important for vegetarians and vegans to supplement.
* **NAC (N-Acetyl-Cysteine)** \- NAC is simply the prodrug of L-Cysteine, an amino acid. NAC is a potent antioxidant, and is responsible for increasing glutathione in the body. NAC may be the most important tool in the arsenal here in terms of reducing urges and cravings. It has tons of clinical evidence demonstrating its efficacy in decreasing cravings and addictive behavior related to trichotillomania (hair pulling), excoriation (skin picking), smoking, gambling, cocaine, marijuana, and more, via modulating glutamate‚Äã. Mechanistically, it‚Äôs believed that NAC may actually alter ‚Äúdrug-induced plasticity that underlies drug-seeking behavior.‚Äù ‚Äã It also happens to have the added benefits of being hepatoprotective (attenuates damage to the liver) and having ameliorative effects on symptoms of depression‚Äã. Anecdotal evidence abounds of people seeing success with NAC for curbing cravings of many kinds. The clinically effective dosage seems to be 1200-2400mg daily. Personally, 1800mg daily allows me to completely avoid biting my fingernails.
* **Agmatine** \- Similar to NAC, agmatine, a natural byproduct of the amino acid arginine, has shown promise in reducing addictive consumption of alcohol, nicotine, methamphetamine, and opioids, via its modulation of imidazoline receptors‚Äã. Agmatine also seems to possess antineurodegenerative and antidepressant properties.‚Äã
* **Exercise, Meditation, Sunlight** \- Again, these things seem to reliably boost dopamine levels, alleviate symptoms of depression, and lower cortisol, among their myriad other health benefits. Wear sunscreen.

Links to 116 research studies at the bottom of [this page](https://www.theoptimizingblog.com/repair-dopamine-receptors/) (my blog post).

**TL;DR:**  Addictive behaviors like porn, gambling, drug use, etc. downregulate dopamine receptors over time. 7 dietary supplements have clinical evidence of upregulating dopamine receptors, and several supplements and activities can boost circulating dopamine levels. These things may not expedite the healing process as a whole, but should at least help alleviate withdrawal symptoms, curb cravings, get you feeling better faster, and help repair dopamine receptors. The most important piece of the healing process is obviously still abstaining from the addictive behavior itself.

Stay safe out there!",53

I've been smoking for a few years and smoking weed for a few less.

I tried to stop both several times but to no avail.
Luckily I gave it another shot recently and I seem to have control over myself now when it comes to ordinary smoking, which makes me very happy.

With weed it's a different story tho. It causes alot of turmoil in my relationship. Very often I just get thoughts about weed somewhere throughout the day, sometimes I can keep these down and sometimes I can't really and I for example voice them to my girlfriend. Which turns into yet another fight cause she doesn't want it in my/our life anymore and I agree with her at all times besides when I crave it specifically.. 

I got somewhat of a wake up call today (won't go into detail) and realised I really want this to be done with and under control.. so I'm asking if anyone has dealt with anything similar and is able to give advice. I just need help in getting my mind off it or a reinforcing progress mechanic (i.e. with smoking I got an app that counts how much money I save which helps with motivation and I started running)

I hope someone can help.

(Normally I'd go to a psychologist but with the whole pandemic business going around it's a bit harder to do so)",1

It‚Äôs funny because while I was using, I never even got too stuck up on percs, it was mainly xanax and klonopin.

This is my first reddit post ever. Today has been a really awesome day. My boyfriend of almost three years has finally agreed to check himself into a rehab facility for his cocaine addiction. I am SO relieved and he actually seems sort of excited about it which is awesome. We made the call to the facility together this morning and I've been on cloud 9 ever since. I started doing some more research on my own (googling stuff like ""how to be a supportive girlfriend while my boyfriend is in rehab"" and ""what relationship changes should I expect after rehab"", etc) and I happened upon a topic that made me a bit uneasy... 

There seems to be a common trend of people being ""brainwashed"" into ending their current relationships while in rehab. I know that this is an INCREDIBLY selfish thing for me to even be worried about right now, obviously my top priority is making sure my boyfriend is healthy and safe and alive. But this still has me a bit worried. I love my boyfriend very much, we talk about marriage often, and aside from his drug use I think we have a very healthy relationship. I would be so crushed if he came out of rehab and suddenly didn't want to be with me anymore because some counselor had put that thought in his head. I understand that part of recovery involves avoiding certain triggers, and that addicts are often encouraged to end toxic friendships and get rid of possessions that remind them of drug use, so if he truly needed to break up with me because being with me reminded him of cocaine then of course I'd be willing to make that sacrifice. But oh boy would it hurt. 

So is it true that this is a common part of recovery? Are addicts really encouraged to end romantic relationships, even healthy, supportive ones? Any advice would be appreciated, thank you so much for taking the time to read this.",1

when i was in law school.  i was dating a girl who had an adderall prescription.  i stole her adderall regularly and basically ruined my life.

but i feel absolutely terrible.  i don't want to ruin one of the only friendships i have.  plus if my wife found out, she would be super upset.  i almost want to call my friend and tell her.  i don't know how to explain something like that.  also i don't know if she even knows, but i feel so guilty and i want to stop doing this.",11

I'll start with saying I dont know a lot about addiction in general, and I sincerely hope I'm not triggering anyone with this post. If so, please tell me and I will delete/edit it immediately. 
I am working and living on a farm, and the son of the owners is an addict who has aspergers syndrome. 
I myself am on antidepressants, which he knows.
He has gone into my room and stolen my pills twice now. First time he went to the hospital because he passed out and hit his head.
After that I got a big lock on my door, which he then broke and stole more of my medication. 
Of course I got angry, but didn't quite know how to deal with the situation without causing any pain.
My medication is now locked in a safe in the parent's house. 
My question to you is how I move on and deal with this? I don't want to let him off the hook and be an enabler, since this is affecting me and I really need my medication, but I also don't want to make things more difficult for him.
I feel that he needs more help than his parents can give him, and they are a bit too gentle on him when he might need some tough love, but again, I don't know enough about him or his issues to have an educated opinion on it.
I hope you can maybe help me understand him and what he needs .

How can I help and get through to her?,"This was originally posted or r/relationship_advise but I thought to post here too in case someone here had  good insight. 

My sister (F24) has always been a trouble maker and has experimented with drugs (weed) from an early age. As we‚Äôve grown out of that rebellious stage I thought she had matured and stayed away from any hard drugs and was getting her life together. However a few months ago she mentioned she had tried coke. This alarmed me because although I support weed use ( to a certain extent) that‚Äôs where I draw the line. She has an addictive personality (smokes weed daily and although it‚Äôs not physically addictive I believe she‚Äôs physiologically addicted  and I have spoken to her about cutting back on that) and so I told her to please stay away from it. However, she admitted to not only doing it more times but also dwelling on pills and other hard drugs she would not tell me about. Me and my brother had a bit of an intervention a couple weeks ago.The biggest problem during that conversation was getting her to understand it was INDEED a big deal (she was saying it wasn‚Äôt , it was only a few times, she wasn‚Äôt addicted to it ...ect). Although she would not  promise she wouldn‚Äôt do it again I really thought we got through to her. I was wrong. Tonight she came home in what looked like a drunken stage but she did not smell of alcohol and it just looked...off. I‚Äôve seen her drunk and it wasn‚Äôt quite it. She wouldn‚Äôt tell us what it was. The worst part ...she drove home in that stage. I am at a loss. I cannot fathom how an adult can make such a reckless decision that can have so many devastating consequences. She could‚Äôve killed herself, she could‚Äôve killed someone else , she could‚Äôve ruined too many lives (she could hardly get in her room that‚Äôs how bad it was). I‚Äôve tried talking to her, making her understand, show her that we are loosing sleep over her decisions. I talk to her calmly , I talk to her like a friend, I play nice and I play tough too and NOTHING seems to get through and I just don‚Äôt know anymore. Dealing with her poor choices has been something I‚Äôve dealt with MY ENTIRE LIFE. Preventing her from getting in trouble and hiding it from my parents has been a full time job since I was born and I am exhausted. I feel like she‚Äôs too old to be doing this and that she should know better, I mean when is it gonna stop? I am beyond worried, and now that she came home like this so are my parents because it‚Äôs now apparent to them there is a problem. I know my sister better than anyone yet it seems nothing I do gets through. What am I doing wrong? How do I make her understand this is not ok? Help me understand, thank you.

Ps: in case there are questions about why she was out (most places have a stay at home orders at the moment due to COVID-19) my city allows for people to go on runs as long as there‚Äôs social distancing. She often drives to a woody area to run or will walk there so it wasn‚Äôt strange that she went out during quarantine but I don‚Äôt think she was there tonight. I think it‚Äôs likely she broke quarantine and drove somewhere else",13

This is the first time in quite a while that I've gone 30 days without nitrous. I know I'm not out of the woods yet - in my 8 year relationship with nitrous I've had periods of a few months of abstinence sprinkled here and there. But I'm really committed to seeing this through and getting better. My ""program"" has mainly consisted of some mindset changes thanks to [Rational Recovery](https://rational.org/index.php?id=1), some life coaching and mentorship, reflecting on years of experience in and out of recovery programs, and a lot of activity on this subreddit trying to encourage others.

I'm still experiencing some neuropathy - mainly in my feet, fingertips, lower leg near the ankle. I've had a series of B12 shots and will probably get another round starting next week. As far as cravings - they've happened occasionally but never overwhelming and never for very long. The lockdown has helped a lot honestly, I'm not sure how this would have panned out if I was still doing the daily commute and lifestyle I had before. That gives me some pause - how will I fare when things go back to normal? Hopefully I can ingrain enough good habits during this initial sober period.

Last night I had my first nitrous related dream. I usually would get this kind of dream after 2 weeks, but I think my commitment to stopping pushed it out of my subconscious for a while. It did sneak back in though. Interestingly, my dreams are never about being high on nitrous, they're always about obtaining nitrous, or the physical act of using nitrous chargers, or getting caught using, or trying to hide the mess of using. The dreams are always behavior related. Something to ponder on.

I know that in my relationship to alcohol for instance, I get a huge rush from opening a liquor or beer bottle and taking the first sip. That rush is much more intense and enjoyable than actually being drunk. I think similarly there is a rush when I pop my first charger in and hit it, something much more powerful than just the drug effect itself. Back when I used to smoke weed (it's been a long time), I got to the point where I didn't like being high, but I liked obtaining weed, smelling it, breaking it down, smoking it. The psychoactive effects of THC were no longer enjoyable. I kind of hated it, sometimes wished I could get weed without THC (I imagine that's possible in a dispensary but I don't live in a state with legal pot).

Anyway just feeling hopeful that I can keep going strong. I wonder if anyone can relate to the dreams or the addiction to the behavior of getting high, more than the high itself.",15

2020-04-09 23:32:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fy7f1n/just_dropped_mom_off_at_rehab/,Just Dropped Mom Off at Rehab...,"Hey guys.  As the title says, we just took my mom to rehab.  She's been dealing with alcohol addiction for a few years now.

I think I just kinda need to rant about it.

I knew she was drinking, and it's a relatively new thing for her.  She was never a teetotaler.  She was a typical social drinker when I was growing up.  She would get a margarita or something like that when she went out with friends maybe a few times a month.  She didn't drink much other than that, and I never saw her drunk that I know of as a kid.

As far as I know she never really had any problems with it until a couple of years ago, but it got bad fast.

I didn't realize how bad it had gotten.

When COVID 19 was first coming to the U.S. I decided to move back in with my parents until it passes as I can work from home, and they live in a much more rural area than me with a much lower infection rate for COVID 19 (don't hassle me about this.  I know I risked them by travelling to them.  We all knew the risks and accepted them.)

It wasn't until I was consistently around her that I saw what the addiction had done to her.  She was basically living off of alcohol.  I seriously don't know when the last time she had anything to eat that wasn't either liquor, the mixers she used for liquor, or some other type of alcohol.

It was insane.

She decided to go to rehab on her own.  She saw a doctor for an unrelated reason a few days ago, and she decided to tell them everything about her alcohol problem.  A few days later, we got her admitted to a facility.

I know she wanted to go, and she knew it needed to be done, but she was still so nervous about it.  She drank today up until right before we got to the facility.  We didn't try to stop her.  We just let her do her thing.

When she got checked in, the first thing she did was blow a breathalyzer.

She blew a .32.

I know for sure that she was nowhere close to as drunk as I've ever seen her.

I didn't know it was that bad.

I'm so happy we took her.  She needs to be there, but I am so worried about her.",19

2020-04-09 20:49:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fy4jim/a_17_year_olds_story_of_addiction_need_to_get/,A 17 Year Olds Story of Addiction (Need to get this off my chest),"I'm 17 years old, soon to be 18. Before I got addicted to cocaine and adderall, I was a victim of addiction itself.

My two brothers were never around growing up, because they were busy popping pills. The pill popping quickly turned into full blown addictions to Meth and Heroin. One brother is now 2 years clean from Heroin, but still slips up on Oxy's here and there. The other is doing time in prison.

My father was a cocaine addict and alcoholic, and my mother was addicted to Adderall. My grandfather was an alcoholic, and my uncle was addicted to Xanax and also an alcoholic.

I was always the good kid growing up. I had great grades, a sweet heart, and a poetic talent and spirit. However, I was never happy. Ever since 12 years old, I'd had suicidal thoughts. Ever since Grade 1, I'd always been bullied by other kids and never accepted in any friend groups.I always was intelligent, but hated myself. I never loved myself for who I was because I felt as if nobody else did.

So, at 12 years old I'd smoked weed for the first time and LOVED it. At 13 years old, I became a daily pot smoker and LITERALLY did not stop at all until just 4 days ago at 17. My dad supplied me with weed to, ""stay off of the other drugs,"" but really I ended up just being unhappy with only smoking weed and got into harder stuff.

Freshmen year, age 15, I got expelled from higshchool. I drink half a jar of moonshine not knowing how strong it actually was. I ended up calling the cops on myself thinking it would be funny. After that, I entered a HUGE depression because I had no friends, my family thought I was a loser, and all I had was Mary Jane to get me through those days. Throughout all of Highschool, I failed every class and earned myself a 0.83 GPA. However, thank god that I went to an alternative school and am now on track to graduate and attend College this year.

Throughout the 3 year span from then and now, I'd tried a handful of drugs. Spice, Oxy, LSD, Adderall, Vyvanse, Cocaine, MDMA, DXM, Alcohol, Xanax, came DANGEROUSLY close to trying meth and heroin, and smoked massive amounts of pot. I also got super hooked on first cigarettes, but enjoyed vaping high nicotine e-liquid better.

But something about the stimulants hooked me. And that happened just at the end of last year.I kept on rationalizing to myself that it was just recreational and that I would do it, ""just one more time.""

One more time turned into 8 straight months of hell and addiction to a level I've never before experienced. Doing line after line, popping pill after pill, and watching litterally 100s and 100s of hours of porn while geeked out of my MIND. It is still somewhat triggering to talk about it, because the memories of being high bring back such STRONG feelings within me.

But I am now 10 days clean of any adderall or cocaine. I am 4 days clean of marijuana. And tommorow, I know it's finally time for me to put down nicotine and, the least harmful (but still harmful) drug of my choice, caffeine.

I make rap music, play guitar, write poems and songs, listen to music, and spend time with my recovering brother (who gives me such great motivation to stay clean). This helps me stay sober.

But there's definitely times throughout the day where I don't feel like doing anything but laying in bed wallowing in my sorrow.I know this withdrawal is not permanent, but I also know that I will always have the addict inside me, and that recovery is a LIFELONG proccess.

Thank you so much for listening to my story, it means the world to me:)",2

It took me so long to acknowledge this because I would always tell myself that I didn't have a problem because I don't use every day.

But I have done and said things that I normally wouldn't just so I could get high, and if that's not a sign of an addict, I don't know what is.

So now I'm motivated to get clean and stay clean, for as long as I can. Does anyone know any apps that will help me track my addiction and my journey? Or any websites?

I've already signed up for drug counselling, and I'm gonna call the local AODS (Alcohol & Other Drugs Service) for support next week.

I've told my close friends and family (some didn't even know I used meth at all), and I have an amazing support network established.

What else do I need to do to ensure I stay away from meth?

Thanks everyone, peace.",1

As for myself, my history with cocaine is quite short-lived. I tried it once and once only at a university party, and didn't like it that much. So a few weeks ago, when I came back from university to my home city due to COVID-19, my brother and I were finally staying under the same roof again.

So a few days in back home, he offered me ""a line"" as well, and I participated in the sessions from then on too. That daily consumption lasted for less than a week though, since pains and my heart and feeling close to death at the end of the day, combined with the inability to fall asleep until 7 am, was my final straw on cocaine.

Now luckily, I did not have the time to develop an addiction myself, so I do not feel any desire to consume the drug yet again. I do feel bad for having facilitated the abuse of cocaine for a short amount of time, in that my father gave us money, and trusted me with it, and I would always give a small portion of it secretly to my brother to buy cocaine before putting the money into the family bank. This I was doing for a few days only since even in that short period of time, the drug managed to mess with my mind. I now highly regret having done that.

This cocaine issue is having a huge financial and emotional burden on our family, since my parents think that my brother is not doing cocaine anymore and is using the money for paying back debts and services. Today is his birthday, so I have decided to take initiative and look for advice to best handle this messed up situation.

Both of my parents also have ongoing problems with drug abuse which I do not want to detail in this post, but I'm just mentioning it as it might be of relevance when approaching this situation. Only my grandmother (and myself now) are fully abstaining from drugs, so I really don't know what to do.

My brother is turning 29 today, and I hope that with this call for help, I will he able to help him start a new and better life, even though he did manipulate and hurt all the family members just to fund his cocaine habit that has already been going on for years.

I would like to open up about this to my parents, but I don't know how to do so without getting myself into trouble or losing the bond that I have with my brother. I know that in the long-term, things will be better if I open up, but i want to do so in a way that minimises the short-term damage as much as possible.

Any advice in my PMs is also welcome if anyone doesn't feel comfortable sharing it publicly. Thanks everyone in advance, and stay safe during this very uncertain time.",1

In the time I didn't take it I was a full time competitive cheerleader practicing 5 days a week hours on end training and conditioning. I had well enough energy for me and never thought about the drug. 

While in high school I heard one of my friends talking about how they got prescribed and it was the best thing ever and I remember asking myself ""I wonder why I stopped taking my prescription?"" . Probably not long after that I started my prescription back up at a 20mg dosage and felt like a whole new productive me. I lost weight and felt like I was on top of the world but never really correlated the adderall and my productiveness, I was a dumb high schooler I know. But after my body started getting used to my 20 mg dosage I soon realized I hadn't been doing the same in sports or school and decided maybe I need to up my dosage so now I have been taking a 30 mg dosage ever since.

I am 20 years old will be 21 in September (:

I am wanting to enlist into the military and have to stop taking it...

To be quite frank I'm scared shitless, because after switching to the 30 mg dosage I started to depend on adderall more and more. Say I accidentally forgot to take it one day or my pharmacy didn't fill my prescription in time I will break down in a anxiety attack because the effects of not taking it after taking it for so long are ruthless and just didn't want to have to go through it. The complete lack of energy I have and the appetite of 4 grown men really do a toll on me. I never really thought anything of it and didn't take it seriously, I just thought that it was me being lazy.

I don't know the clear defining of being addicted or being dependent on the drug I just know when I wake up I just have a routine of waking up taking my adderall having a coffee and some breakfast then after it would start to kick in I would proceed to do what I had to do that day.

I have tried not to take it weeks at a time, not stopping all together, every once and awhile because I didn't think the adderall was the thing making me, me. I would eventually gain weight from the constant eating, and then proceed to sleep and sleep and sleep. Eventually ending up taking it again thinking I didn't take it for a week and didn't like the person I was and just thought that was my personality.

SOOOO with all that said I don't even know where to start. I don't think slowly reducing my dosage will work, I feel FOR ME, I just have to stop taking it all together. I'm hoping there are people who have gone through similar situation or just even quitting the drug like I am attempting to do.

Tomorrow I am not going to take my adderall and need advice on what to do to help the crash of the drug. I am desperate for any tips because I am so scared of the physical and mental exhaustion from stopping.

2019 in August I was high for 5 days on a rave, and after that I had to go to a hospital because my stomach hurt so bad and I wasn't able to use drugs anymore cause everytime I tried the pain came back even stronger.
I also met my girlfriend at this rave and she never tried drugs. Now for the first time in my life I want something else then being high, I want a family, kids, a house and a good job. I finally have something to fight for.
There is just one problem, I can't stop smoking weed, sometimes I do nothing for days, I don't work, I just sit there and smoke pot until I have to sleep and when I wake up I do the same thing over and over again. It has been very bad the last few weeks since lock down, I just can't stop smoking. So I didn't bought anything yesterday or today and I m going crazy. I know it's just pot and it should be easy to stop but it isn't.
I know my girl will leave me sooner or later if I don't stop, and I want to stop for myself to, because I don't feel good. But I can't.
Now thanks for reading and I would be glad about some advice or help because I can't stop thinking about buying weed and being high again.
Sorry for my English, it's not my first language but I hope it's fine.
Thanks again.


Edit: I really don't understand how I could stop every drug, I didn't even have a beer since August, but I can't stop weed. It's crazy that the weakest drug is the hardest to quit. I remember the cold turkey and the pain, the madness, but I was able to survive all of that. But weed, it seems to be stronger than me. I really really want to quit. I just want to get my life together and be a good man for my girl.",1

Not necessarily watching, but Thinking about a girl age 18-59 wearing certain panties and having another girl suck the milk out of her titties, now were talking!

I have been able to find VERY few videos online of such a fetish since I was introduced to porn at age 13 over the summer of 2008, (they get drowned out by fucking porn, like a man fucking a woman) I hate that shit, always have always will as not my cum of tea.

For my lesbian fetish with panties and titties I don't even need to watch it, Mr. Wonka (Gene Wilder) taught me how to use my imagination at a rather young age as I became a Mr. Wanka and that is what I have been doing since.

I have been jerking off since November 2005 at the age of 10, I loved it then as I love it now as a 24/m.

It has been quite consistently once or perhaps twice a day at opposite ends, Morning/Night.

It rarely negatively affects my life because I have other activities to enjoy during the day apart from jerking off.  95% of the time it is negative would be do to boredom or an escape from depression as oppose to a reward for a good days work.",1

Probably will be a long post. I fucked up. Some background information. I have been struggling with depression for a number of years. I have a brother who has been using for the past 10 years. And I started about 4 years ago and am struggling a lot. I use about once a month. I currently live at home with my mom because work has not been steady for me due to my depression and the impact of my addiction on my life. 

I have been doing Alanon, outpatient group 3x a week, and seeing a therapist weekly. I have talked to my parents about going through recovery. I have told them I don‚Äôt want their help because I have to live with this disease for the rest of my life. And I need to be able to understand what will work for my path. My parents tried to do an intervention years ago for my addict brother but they ended up not going through with it. As such, they don‚Äôt really even ask at all. When I tell my mom I‚Äôm scared of continuing to fail, she tells ‚Äúme I‚Äôm not trying to get the help I need.‚Äù If it is so simple to get it I would have done it by now. 

I have been worried a lot during this pandemic as to how I was going to be able to handle and make sure my mom was safe. I have been diligent about following a lot of the guidelines. My oldest brother was in an accident two weekends ago and my parents went to another state 6 hours away to visit for a week. I called them daily to ask how they are doing as my brother was hit by a car and is in ICU. Locally my sister in law is a pharmacist at a grocery chain and my brother locally is in law enforcement. My brother and sister in law have been having my mom babysit their kids despite the constant risk of exposure consistently on a weekly basis. 

I fucked up this weekend. I went and used at a person‚Äôs house. I was by myself in a room by myself. I don‚Äôt call them friends because I am not friends with anyone that I use with but I know the precautions they are taking for the pandemic. Didn‚Äôt contact family for a few days. Well. I am now living out of a hotel for the next few nights and hoping to get into inpatient somewhere. My brother and mom have told me to get the fuck out because they don‚Äôt know where I was. Yelling at me and my brother in law enforcement said he was going to physically throw me out of the house. I said I would leave for a few days. I really deserve this I know for being selfish. There may be in place close by which I can go that might be taking inpatients. But I‚Äôm so sad. I was so scared of physical abuse yesterday morning. But I yelled at my brother and mom because I needed to get my medicine and they couldn‚Äôt dictate what I was going to did for the few hours I was home. Meaning, I got home at 8/9 PM at night and tried calling the 1800 number I had for inpatient with no one responding. I woke up the next day at 8 to call my counselor to help figure out what was still available. I spent the next hour on the National Suicide Prevention hotline trying to get them to walk me off of the edge. I packed a few bags. Potentially for in patient. 

I know I was selfish. I know I put myself in this situation. I know I will never be and don‚Äôt deserve love. I knew before anything if my parents get sick, I will be blamed because i am the addict despite the high risk job of my brother and sister in law. I have been in crisis so much the past few weeks. I have always thought there is not future for me. I deserve this and maybe just killing myself is the best option. Even before now. What point is there to living when you don‚Äôt deserve love. My heart aches so much because I love my family but I believe they hate me. I am trying to work with my counselor to potential do work outside of inpatient but I don‚Äôt have hope for recovery.

There are two things that may be glimmer of hope for me. 
1. On the suicidal hotline, the person stated something about pride and I have realized what pride is. It isn‚Äôt arrogance; it‚Äôs a feeling that is used to disguise or prevent me from really recognizing my shame and guilt over the past few years in being able to truly tackle my addiction. 
2. I think I am not scared of failing; I think the fear is the risk of failing and continuing to hurt the relationships I have. 

I just needed to get these out there. I don‚Äôt know what my next few days will holdout to be. But I know I‚Äôm undeserving of love so if others who read this still have the family and friends that care, don‚Äôt tarnish anything further for yourself.",1

I drink 2-3 ‚Äúmonster energy‚Äù cans a day. I‚Äôd drink more if I wasn‚Äôt slightly worried about my health so I follow up with a 1 litre bottle of something fizzy, like Coca Cola for example. I‚Äôve done this for over 10 years.

I‚Äôm aware of all the health stuff; diabetes, kidney stones, bad circulation, heart damage, rotting teeth etc. This terrifies me. But it doesn‚Äôt stop me.

It‚Äôs the same with smoking too. Aware of all the risks, doesn‚Äôt stop me. I don‚Äôt want to drink these things or smoke any more. It was ‚Äúfun‚Äù and now it‚Äôs not ‚Äúfun‚Äù. Now it‚Äôs a must. I literally cannot function without them. I‚Äôm tired of every day having the anxiety and panic of ‚Äúdo I have my monsters/cigs, do I have enough to get through the day etc‚Äù. 

I saw a photo of myself from a few years ago and it‚Äôs shocked me how much I‚Äôve declined. I look like I‚Äôm ill. When you see yourself every day you don‚Äôt notice it, and then when you do notice it, it‚Äôs heart breaking. But you‚Äôre addicted, so you continue with it. :(

What can I do, honestly? Literally anything. Any sort of system or technique that can get me through this? I‚Äôve tried to stop both of them before and I just couldn‚Äôt function without them. Time felt really slow, I felt restless, I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I felt like I was gonna have a mental breakdown at any minute, I was always panicky and didn‚Äôt feel like ‚Äúmyself‚Äù when I was out in public etc.

I‚Äôm on my last straw here and it‚Äôs all pathetic. People often don‚Äôt realise just how dangerous and silently destroying something like energy drinks are. I think everyone is aware of cigarettes though.

Sorry for ranting I just don‚Äôt have any other options. I just wanna be over all of this and not have to go through my days knowing I‚Äôm killing my self but continuing to do it anyway.

 When she initially moved in she wanted the sleepout, but changed her mind and is now in the separate workshop where she is more private. Has a fridge in there and everything. The house currently looks like a junkyard but she said she would have it sorted in a week so I'm just giving her that as she works full time from home..

How do I best help this woman? I believe she has a good heart. This is my first step into understanding addiction so I hope I didnt offend anyone. I really need some advice",16

When the Feeling Returns 

When the feeling returns
It bursts through your veins
Erupting like the fire of Vesuvius
Excruciating and beautiful

The fresh air surges in
The soot is blown away in a squall
But your lungs so used to the smog
Their calluses burn to its touch

The new tide brings both life and pain 
Drowning out who you were
Giving tenuous sanctuary to who you are
Threatening to take you back out to sea

To be yourself again
But not know who you are now
The contradiction of clarity and confusion
Its mercuriality taunting you to concede



Therein lies 
The pain from which you fled
The beauty which you seek 
The feelings which you now feel again",5

Unfortunately since I‚Äôm in the military and stationed overseas. It has had some excruciating times. I‚Äôm a terrible person for enlisting and pretty much forcing myself out of her life. I was so ignorant and blind as she cried about me going. We‚Äôre long distance now for 7 months and I‚Äôve talked to my command so I can go back home and get married after deployment. Sadly I won‚Äôt be home until early 2021 with covid19 and other circumstances. She broke up with me a couple of weeks ago. Started talking to a guy that‚Äôs similar to myself. Similar hobbies, humor etc. but also said she wants me to come home and loves me and regrets leading him on. Even said she would of hated this guy if I met him first(but uhh well. we all know she ruined a possible best friend for me what ever it‚Äôs cool I guess). We still talk and over FaceTime a couple of days ago, she told me she‚Äôs been on coke every day since last month and it really shows. Im not sure words can equate to how I feel, but excruciating is a start. Knowing she‚Äôs home starting right where she left off 3 years back and there‚Äôs a younger, fucking horny knock off brand of myself out there on the prowl trying to slide in and take advantage of my Fianc√© (this fucking douche I swear). She was high tonight and told me she doesn‚Äôt plan on stopping or happy without it. Being sober now hurts. She‚Äôs losing a lot of weight and can‚Äôt eat without vomiting. I broke her. I took what we had when it was good for granted. And I hate myself for it. I need help getting her back on her feet. I know she won‚Äôt go to rehab without someone els dragging her. I really don‚Äôt want to get to that point. Not yet at least. I want her to change and would like advice to get her to convince herself again. I know if I didn‚Äôt enlist I would still have my little stinky. We‚Äôre both scared that when I do come back to the states. It won‚Äôt be the same anymore.

I want to feel something. Anything. I constantly seek out an escape route through alcohol and cocaine. And attention. But that‚Äôs another story.

The cocaine is the biggest problem. It‚Äôs consuming me. And I‚Äôm not a woman who anyone would assume ‚Äúdoes drugs.‚Äù But I AM a woman who does drugs. I‚Äôm slowly losing myself. I‚Äôm empty. I‚Äôm a liar. I‚Äôm distant. Hollow.

It‚Äôs all I think about. Until I decide I‚Äôm DONE. I‚Äôm NOT doing this anymore! 

For a few days. I‚Äôll find a way to get more. I am desperately searching and craving a high that isn‚Äôt even working anymore. I wish I had never tried it. It‚Äôs been three years and what started out as fun on the weekends has turned into isolation and paranoia. The occasional binge by myself where I end up wondering what I‚Äôm even doing here. 

Is this who I am? 
No.
How do I change?
Crickets.

Will life always be this chaotic? Will I always have to choose between being sober and present or addicted and distant? 

I‚Äôm hurting. I‚Äôm desperate. I‚Äôm searching for something to fill a void.

I‚Äôm so loved. I know I am. So does the self-sabotage and addiction just go hand in hand?

Realized that I‚Äôm asking a lot of questions. I don‚Äôt need answers. I just want someone to tell me they get it. That it gets better.

I know it will. I‚Äôll get better.",4

This is absolutely brutal.,"I've always loved Adderall, it has treated me so well. The first time I ever took it I fell in love instantly. It was a blessing and a curse. It made all of my problems disappear and was the only thing that made me genuinely happy. So to make a long story short, I ended up taking it nearly every day for the next 8 or 9 months. After that I never went a single day without it. As time went on, the amount and rate at which I was taking it only increased and up to this day it's been over a year now since I first started.

I'm currently trying to wean off slowly, forcing myself to take a little bit less as the days go by. It feels like my sober self is a completely different person who I haven't been in touch with in a long time, I feel like I am going to have to meet and get to know my sober self all over again. As I'm beginning to take less, I am also beginning to experience withdrawal symptoms.

Let me just say, what I am feeling/experiencing is dark as fuck. Like it's actually scary, I would not wish this feeling on my worst enemies. It's not the worst I've ever felt in my life, but it's definitely comparable to it. So I just have one question...

I know that there are people out there who have certainly taken higher dosages than me to an even greater extent than I have for an even longer (sometimes much, much longer) period of time, but given my situation; having taken Adderall (\~30-40mg a day) for a over about a year straight, how long can I expect withdrawal symptoms to last? I know they are not permanent but I just want to know how long I should prepare to feel like this for.",58

2020-04-06 11:24:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fw0nfc/sex_addict_talking_or_the_beginning_of_the_end/,"Sex addict talking, or the beginning of the end?","My boyfriend (31M) recently shared with me (33F) that he wants to have a polygamous relationship. We've been together for 5 years and he is a recovering alcoholic and cocaine addict. He has been in recovery for almost 2 years; I'm not an addict but I attend Al-Anon and support groups. I've been in ""recovery"" for almost 1 year. 

Throughout all the turbulence of the first 3 years of our relationship, no matter how bad it got, we always said we would be there for each other and he was 100% devoted to me. The addiction was at its peak then and drove him to disappear for days on end while consuming drink and drugs until his bank account was empty. Throughout all this, he always said he was completely loyal and believed in a monogamous relationship. When he disappeared, he said he had never cheated on me and I 100% believe him. 

Once he started recovery, he started getting ""addicted"" to other things, like porn, painkillers, caffeine, sweets, energy drinks. Over the past years, he has slowly phased these things out of his life one-by-one. He's done an amazing job and I am so proud of him. 

About a year ago, he went to a Sexaholics Anonymous support group meeting and confessed to me that he was a sex addict as well. When he saw other women, he felt urges, although he would never act on them. A few months ago, he told me that he was now wanting a polygamous relationship. His reasoning was, he didn't want to get to 60 years old and regret not exploring more with other people. He said sex with me is good and he is satisfied but he just wants to explore sex with other people. Meanwhile, he sees himself growing old with me and couldn't imagine spending his life with anyone else. 

I gave him my stance on that, which was: I do not want a polygamous relationship. I know myself and what I want and if he really wants to go down that road, then I won't be going there with him. I am also not the most stable of people and I know myself enough that this will destroy me mentally and emotionally. He said to me, well why don't we compromise, because if you don't let me do what I want, we will break up anyway. We have a beautiful flat that we bought together, a cat, and a very comfortable life here so it sounds like an ultimatum so that he can have his cake and eat it too. 

Since we already had a chat previously about his sex addiction, I don't know how much of this change of heart has been driven by his addiction. I don't want to lose him but I definitely do not want to be sitting at home waiting while he is sleeping with other people. This is not the life I want. I don't know what to do right now and feel manipulated and hurt. However, walking away from a flat that we both own and our sweet cat is not something I can just do tomorrow. 

I suggested he go back to the SA meeting and he said he didn't have to. He said he had spoken to his NA sponsor several times about this, who apparently said, well if you don't try it out then you won't know. I can't imagine that another addict from a 12-step programme would recommend something like that. I said to my bf that surely, if you had said something like, I would like to try heroin, he would not say something like that. Why is sex any different? He then replied, sex is different because it is not harmful to the body. He's always been a bit bi, so at first he was saying, I'm thinking about sex with me - they have dicks and you don't and that's just something you will never be able to fulfil. More recently now, he wants to sleep with both men and women. 

Again, I really don't know what is driving this at this stage. I don't know if this is his addiction driving this conversation, or it is the beginning of a break-up and I might as well end it now before everything gets messy. I'll be speaking to my own sponsor to but  I'm hoping that some people with who have dealt with addiction + relationships might be able to shed some light or share some experiences.",1

My main issue is alcohol but not that I'm nearly 2 months free of that and never want to be where it took me again I find myself using literally anything else I can get my hands on like a starving dog picking through trash.

Rehab was good, I enjoyed it. The structure, the socializing, the accountability and then you get thrown back out into the real world with all of these tools to use and no reason to use them. Why try and remain sober when it really feels as though there's no good reason too. One of my favorite quotes is ""he who has a why can bare almost any how"". It resonates with me so much because I have no real why and as a result struggle wanting to bear any how. 

I don't think I'm unfairly victimized any more than the next guy, everyone has a plateful of bullshit they have to eat every day. I just feel like there's no reason to eat mine. So I guess, here I am again, smoking weed, taking benzos like they're candies, last night was oxycodone. I use nicotine, kava, preworkouts, anything really that will pass some time till I can go to sleep again.

I've been getting my workouts in but as of recently they've been so emotionally empty, just going through the motions cause if I stop then people will think somethings wrong. So I drag myself through them.

I wanna go back to rehab, where there was people to talk to, enforced structure in my day, and things I had to do. That was nice.

¬†¬†by Laurence Paul Dunbar


We wear the mask that grins and lies,

It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,‚Äî

This debt we pay to human guile;

With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,

And mouth with myriad subtleties.


Why should the world be over-wise,

In counting all our tears and sighs?

Nay, let them only see us, while

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†We wear the mask.


We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries

To thee from tortured souls arise.

We sing, but oh the clay is vile

Beneath our feet, and long the mile;

Could end up with 5 sessions in a single day. Of course, after each session I would feel sleepy and lazy. I could not even control my urges before and during big moments like examinations and approaching deadlines).

I have stopped for the past month and haven't had an urge strong enough to make me relapse at all. Even if I felt the urge, I was never overwhelmed by it and I had it under control with minimal effort. This was the first time where I felt like I was not even trying to suppress my excessive horniness. It just went away. I don't even think about it anymore. I don't even entertain dirty thoughts in my head. I'm confident in my ability to maintain this lifestyle for the rest of my life.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

What worked for me:

*1) Cleaning up my diet.*

I have cut out **all** added oils in my diet and began consuming a salad before every meal. Plus I only have animal products (fish and eggs) for one meal every two days. But I ensure that I meet my daily requirement for healthy fats. As a result I have gotten a lot leaner.

2) *Not having my phone next to me at bed time*

This one's a no-brainer.

3) *Supplementation.*

I began taking Omega 3 (vegan), Zinc Picolinate, Ashwagandha & Bacopa monnieri extract. I'm not sure if it is a placebo, but I'm fairly certain that Bacopa and Ashwagandha give me a mental clarity that aid me in suppressing my desires. I take Omega 3 and Zinc since I follow a primarily plant based diet.

4) *I do heavy resistance workouts 6 times a week and play basketball at least twice a week.*

This probably helps me feel tired enough to drain my body of its ability to feel horny all the time.

5) *Improving my posture*

This could be a result of point 4, but I used to hunch a lot when I walk. Now, I maintain a more neutral thoracic spine and appear and feel more confident and masculine as a whole. This was a product of strengthening the muscles around my neck and upper back.

6) *Adopting a more conservative view*

This one is probably a little controversial, especially here on reddit. But I began to value and respect modesty and the sanctity of sex and females in general. I began to view immodestly dressed women as distractions more than anything else. This by no means mean that I do not respect them. I simply think of them as tests that I have to pass with my newfound will power :)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now, I did not isolate the individual factors to see which was the most effective at curbing my addiction. But I don't want to. I'd like to attribute my success to my general sense of well being.

I have tried at least 5 unsuccessful attempts in the past where I would relapse within 2 weeks. My past attempts were unsuccessful as I felt like I was simply trying to not do it instead of tackling it from a different angle (eg. well being and mental health). Once I did relapse, I will go at it for 3 to 4 times in a row and end up feeling depressed.

I have used this quarantine period as an opportunity to better myself. I understand that staying at home all day could breed negative thoughts. But it doesn't have to!

If negative reinforcement does not work for you, try approaching the problem from another angle. You could have been fighting the wrong battle all along. Focus on something else. All of us are built differently and we respond to different stimuli differently. You don't have to go cold turkey either. It started with me doing it less frequently until I just did not feel like doing it anymore.

Good luck!

I've spent upwards of $15,000-$20,000 since the age of 12 on psychic readings (currently 21) and although it does ease my anxiety and, in the past, helped with my depression (during middle school and high school), I now have this dependency on psychic readings every time I feel stress or anxiety. I get at least 1-5 readings/day. 

I used to justify this as a ""medical expense"" (obviously it's not) but I'm now realizing that it's detrimental to my finances and mental health because of my dependency on these readings.

As of tomorrow, I begin (online) graduate school after a year hiatus. For the past several years, I have been smoking cannabis daily, and drinking 3-5x a week. I have tried to quit before but have always failed due to my own accord (weak willpower). Over the course of my cannabis and alcohol abuse, I have become increasingly lazy, more adversely emotional, and tend to have this permanent sleepy/fuzzy feeling in my head. I can sleep for 12 hours sometimes and wake up still feeling drowsy, and I really hate feeling this way; it's not me.

In light of my new educational training, I want to begin to feel normal again. I would like to cut weed and alcohol out cold turkey, but I am going to be lenient with myself for the first month and allow myself to smoke or drink 1-2x a week after all of my classwork is done. After about a month or two, I would like to revert to only smoking 1-4x a year for fun social occasions or holidays.

It is going to be extremely difficult to quit because all of my friend group smokes or drinks, and I get free unlimited weed and alcohol (my girlfriend owns a bar and cannabis business, and our friends own bars, clubs, restaurants, and businesses in both industries so I am literally given gifts monthly, and I cannot leave this friend group as my girlfriend and I are both part of the group). 

What are some positive life changes and supplements I can take to help revert my body back to normal?  Any sober night time activities I could partake it would be great too. I am 24 year old female who exercises 1-3x a week and am in perfect health despite being low in iron, B vitamins (from alcohol) and vitamin D, all of which I have supplements for that I take irregularly. I am clinically diagnosed with depression and anxiety, the latter being a daily proponent for me wanting to abuse substances. I know I need to make this lifestyle change and stop my cannabis and alcohol abuse, and now is the time to do it. Any advice you guys could give me would be much appreciated!",1

2020-04-05 12:48:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fvguzl/my_relationship_with_alcohol/,My relationship with alcohol.,"About me:
I have been a habitual drinker since the age of 13. Father loves booze so much he makes his own. Both grandfather died before age 55 because they drank heavily. I vaguely remember only 1 of them.
Story time: 2 years ago I was a booze addict. I didn't necessarily binge or drank myself to sleep, but rather led a ""student bohemian"" life. At any point in time; my fridge would be full of bear/the fridge would contain around 100$ worth of hard liquor. I would come home, and mix something for myself. Day by day. I did many school assignments drunk simply because I did not enjoy my degree. Then I tried to cut myself off from bad influences and loser friends in an attempt to clean up. It worked. I spent 2 wonderful and somewhat productive summer months. 1,5 years ago, I went on an exchange semester. Sadly, the drinking culture is VERY ingrained in Erasmus programmes. I hit a rock bottom in my relationship with alcohol. To a point where I would drink daily, many times as soon as I hopped out of the bed. I would then go to my classes tipsy, and possibly continue drinking after school. Whenever I wouldn't be drinking, my hands would shake a little bit. I have always had a bad skin issues, but my skin condition worsened considerably. Something cracked in my head - I started developing self hatred for what I have become. This had to stop. I decided to quit cold turkey. I slammed (drank it all) the vodka bottle I had in my room, and decided that would be the last drop of it. I called some of my closest friends of that time and promised I am stopping. In fact I invited them on a  spontaneous hangout to commemorate my decision. We just talked and ate pizza that night. ;)
As I am writing this I have been sober ever since. I still hang out with my drinker friends. I view them as entertainment at parties. In fact, I enjoy getting them drunk through my librarian knowledge of drinking games. But always find the strength to say no. I sometimes do wonder about how nice it would be to open a cold beer bottle after a busy day. Instead I start chewing on a piece of gum, and grab a book/Nintendo Switch. Then I would fall asleep faster and the sleep would be of better quality. This allows me to wake up at 4:30 AM EVERY morning without exceptions and get a workout in by 6:00 AM. I average 500,000 steps monthly. When I am not working, I volunteer for conferences because I have so much free time (from not drinking, duh) - within a year I would spend a month worth of work time working for free. I meet awesome people that way and I believe I am a valued member of society. Relationships with my relatives have improved and I lead a wonderful life. I am 23 years old. Started drinking at 13, dropped at 21.
I made this post to remind you that is never too early to get your shit in order. Do not settle for mediocre life just because everyone else spends their fridays destructively! Life has so much more to offer. You can afford those things because you suddenly have lots of spare money from not drinking. :)",12

I know someone that‚Äôs recently had a lapse in judgment and decided to use again. So I thought asking others on this subreddit their opinion and if they have had a lapse or relapse, how they dealt with that situation. I‚Äôve been in recovery for about 2 years or so and have had 3 relapses since I‚Äôve started my journey and currently have around 18 months clean from opiates. Personally I think of a lapse/relapse as a learning experience more than I do a failure. You only fail when you give up. The way I like to explain a relapse is using a Gordon Ramsey metaphor. Do you think Gordon Ramsey became a master chef overnight or in a few years? No he‚Äôs failed countless times before he became a master chef but with each failure came a learning experience and the best experience is personal first hand experience. With each failure of a dish he learned a little more. He learned what worked and what didn‚Äôt. And after so many failed attempts he learned how to make that dish damn near perfect. Recovery and relapse is a lot like that. You can fail and turn it around. Learn from that experience. Or you can fail and keep it that way by giving up. So what‚Äôs your guys take on this topic. What worked for you? What‚Äôs your personal experience? And more importantly do you have a metaphor for recovery, lapses, relapses, or prolapses.",2

I am under a lot of stress due to COVID, family issues, and my physical health issues. I am in the diagnosis process of either Lupus or Mixed Connective Tissue Disease, which caused this situation and complicates it. I also have bipolar I which makes me more susceptible to addiction. After going to the ER for a new symptom, I was prescribed Valium to take as needed. The first time I took it I legitimately thought it would help. The second time and third time I just knew it would knock me out so I wouldn't be conscious through the pain and vertigo. I didn't feel comfortable taking it just to sleep but I did anyway. This morning, because I was upset, I added alcohol to my coffee impulsively. I remembered I had taken the valium and looked up how soon I could drink after and found it was way too early. I still finished it and drank another. I started to feel way more out of it and different that two drinks, or really any amount of alcohol, has made me feel. And I liked it. I'm scared I will do it again and make a habit of it/ escalate it since it was all very impulsive. 
My question is, is it too early to do anything about it? I considered calling a help line but I don't want to bother them. I considered disposing of the valium but it's the only thing that I have that can treat what they think is nerve inflammation, which can be dangerous if untreated. I know I shouldn't have mixed it and that I shouldn't again but I feel like I will. I also have a long standing problem with over working myself passed the point of exhaustion for no reason (honestly probably triggered my health issues) and it's a similar feeling to that. 
TL; DR: I impulsively had alcohol within the window of valium (prescribed) still being in my system and liked it, feel like I'll do it again. Don't know how to prevent doing it again.

Update: Thank you so much for all the advice and support. I haven't taken the valium again but I'm still compulsively drinking. I told my sister, who is an alcoholic about it and she said to call her whenever I'm about to do it. I'm working on finding a telehealth therapy program.",1

I smoke heroin and meth and I really need to quit.  I will become homeless if I don't stop and I got lucky and have a place to stay currently with my fianc√© who also doesn't feel bad about using.  I would rather be a homeless addict than not be with my fianc√©. I also would rather be sober than not be with my fianc√©.  I love her more so much and want to be with her forever.  We were both alcoholics but we don't drink anymore after switching to heroin and meth.  We both hate alcohol and are very happy to be off of it. Both of us never want to drink again, personally we both find alcohol to be more destructive for us.  I think alcohol would have ruined our relationship by now. I have done many regrettable things that I am ashamed of because of alcohol.

My problem is that I love smoking h&m. I also feel happy most of the time and I feel better about myself than I ever have before.  I don't think that is because of the drugs, but there are some notions about addiction that I do not think apply to me, like doing drugs because I don't like myself.  Also, I found out a couple years ago that I had repressed trauma in my brain.  My father and I got into it, he triggered me into having a regression, repressed memory and implicit flashbacks. It was a very powerful experience and my fianc√© helped me work through it.  I had no idea I had been traumatized like that and I think it's a strong case for why I am an addict.

I feel like I've worked through that. I've forgiven my father and I don't feel like this is driving my addiction as some people seem to claim.  I just like the way the drugs feel, I have a high tolerance and don't get too ""high"" anymore, but I am definitely affected by them in a way that is positive for my mood.   I feel like these drugs are medicinal, the hole in my soul is filled by them.  I don't understand why taking antidepressants is ok, but taking these is not ok.

Most people in my life started actively avoiding me when they found out I was doing these drugs.  They 
are either afraid of me or disgusted by me or both. A lot of people pity us, and sometimes it felt like they were eagerly anticipating me to hit rock bottom because that's what addicts like me deserve. We were car-homeless for 4 months last year and learned a lot about how society perceives addicts - very negatively.  We were treated poorly by strangers, and the common opinion is that addicts deserve shitty lives because they are shitty people.  It made my fianc√© lose a lot of faith in humanity.  I come from a very poor family and was treated with a similar attitude often when I was growing up.

I do feel awful about how selfish this lifestyle is. I do feel awful about being a sponge and living for free. I feel awful that most of my life is dedicated to the pursuit of drugs.  But I have convinced myself that these problems are more inherent to the system I live in than the drugs I ""abuse"".  I don't know why the  government and society want me to be punished for using drugs.  I could hold down a job and be an active member of society if I could legally take my drugs and they were dirt cheap.  I have thought through this scenario and I do think there would see a dramatic uptick in drug use throughout the population initially, which would eventually slow down as drug awareness and harm reduction were encouraged.  I think society would be better off, as there would be less homelessness and poverty.

I think drug addiction is a disease people give themselves, but I think they are predisposed to doing so.  My friend group and I all experimented with pot and alcohol at the same time in high school, but none of them are addicts like I am. I felt compelled to keep doing more and more and they did not.  I think I did because of my environment at home and because I loved not being sober, because my brain was jacked up.  If that means I am a weak person I don't care. I can live with that, I've learned to not let people's opinions bother me too much.  I don't think addicts are weak people. I think they struggle more and have hard lives. 

I know most people here won't agree with my views.  It seems like addicts hate the drugs more than anybody, so it's no wonder everyone else does. Addiction is looked at so negatively, and the addict is looked at with pity and disdain.  I just don't think it's fair for addicts to have to be sober like everyone else, because addicts have a much harder time being sober.  They need support and everyday is a struggle to not fall back into addiction.  It hurts my heart when I read about how destroyed someone is by relapsing. They are so hard on themselves for giving in and think they are weak.  I wish they wouldn't take it so badly, it's hard to live life actively fighting off what makes you feel better. I'm not ready to stop, but I totaled my car yesterday and lost the only material possession of value I had, and with it my only way of making money.  I don't want to quit using drugs, but if I don't I will be homeless.

Our boy was born very traumatically and we both should have lost our lives. 

So my partner prior to us being together was quite the party animal, known by everyone where we live. Also used various drugs from being 12/13. When we met he assured me he didn‚Äôt really do anything no more apart from occasional weed, which didn‚Äôt interest me but it wasn‚Äôt the worst. Anyway fast forward around a year when our son was about 10 months old, I found a bag of Ketamine in our kitchen and he broke down crying. We agreed he‚Äôd get help, he went to the doctors and had some counselling but they didn‚Äôt think he was an addict because he said he could stop. Fast forward through the years this has happened several times, each time I‚Äôve tried to help him and support him best I can. But he just can‚Äôt stop, he doesn‚Äôt do it everyday but he has to do it at some point for whatever reason. I know some will obviously say I should leave, but he appears to do well then just ruins any progress. He‚Äôs put our son in harm twice before I found out and looked after him while using Ketamine when I‚Äôd gone out. He simply says he enjoys it. It‚Äôs also never when he‚Äôs out, when you could expect it. It‚Äôs if we‚Äôre just sat at home. I just feel lost, I don‚Äôt know what more I can do. I don‚Äôt want to essentially throw everything away but there‚Äôs a point, and if I‚Äôm honest I don‚Äôt think I should have to deal with this.

Can anyone give me some advice? Or what helped if they‚Äôve been in a similar situation?",1

Resentment is unresolved anger you keep alive by replaying a scene or conversation in your mind and dredging up the hurt again and again. You are the one who suffers when you hold on to resentments because these feelings feed on themselves and can threaten your recovery. Pages 63&ndash;65 in Alcoholics Anonymous tell how to inventory resentments.

As you perform your everyday inventory to investigate how you feel and react to daily life, remember to identify and describe any lingering or growing resentments.

Answer these questions:
 ‚Ä¢ What is the cause of the resentment? (What happened? Why are you angry?)
 ‚Ä¢ How does the cause of your resentment affect you? (Does it affect your self-esteem, pride, emotional or financial security, ambitions, or relationships?)
 ‚Ä¢ What part did you play? (Were you dishonest, selfish, fearful, or inconsiderate?)

Action for the Day

What behavior patterns do you recognize, and which need the most work? How can you prevent future resentments?

Thought for the Day

&#x200B;

The good old AA members kept blocking me and kicking me out of the zoom online meetings.

Mostly because I put forward positions and information that the brain-washed cannot deal with...

Liek the stats on the AA relapse rate, the churn rate were 50% of newcomers are gone within 3 months and at the end of every year there are only 5% of the newcomers left..... 

When you ask, ""Why does AA have such a stupendous failure rate? And what are you people in the groups and service structure doing to promote the ""unpalatability"" of the membership of AA, and to reverse it?

They have no answers.

Warfare breaks out.  So with my 43 years of being around AA - I am no push over to the bullshit and I will and do hammer these people when they try it on.  ""We serve up our clubby crap to him and expect to get away with it, and he wipes the floor with everyone in the group. Tsk, Tsk, Tsk - we have better boot him from the online meetings"".

So I launch this into their chat rooms.

&#x200B;

The AA failure rate - how much of this is due to AA being the worst performing of all treatments (George Valiant - AA trustee conducted university trials - look them up) and people just not willing to put in the effort to deal with ALL their issues - not just alcohol?

For every 10,000 welcome to NA / AA chips are bought by the groups, only ONE 20 years drug free medallion is bought. What happened to the the other 9,999 people? I did the global research on the issue 10 years ago, and had it published here. [https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html](https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-effectiveness.html) If you don't believe me, ask your area / national office for their sales figures.

Of course the dickheads in this meeting will screech ""You can't say that"" - ""Well I can, and I have, and what I say is true. It's been 41 years, 10 months and 17 days since I made the decision to stop using. And all the vitriolic fuckwits that will denounce me and kick me from the group - You are the ones, who are going to become the ones, who are going to die using. LOL - Your the 9,999, out of the 10,000 who were not prepared to do what it takes to get to 20 years drug free.

""Oh boot him! boot him from the meeting"".... they screech.

Well the intolerance of people who convey information based upon fact, and the unwillingness to make the most of the opportunity when it comes your way, AND the unwillingness to do anything other than talk shit instead of putting in the hard work - that's where the 9,999 relapsers out of the 10,000 come from.

In all my years, NOT one of you ever have the humility and scincerity to ask, ""What do I have to do, to stay drug free, deal with all my issues, one day at a time, for the rest of my life?"" - To me, almost all of the people here, are just talkers of shit.  The clubby, crawly, incrowd....

Gods special education team - totally intolerant of any opinion, other than their own.

Get on the phone, and ask your regional offices for a copy of their medallion sales figures for the last 10 years....

It's not the absolute accuracy that is the issue, it's the gaping chasm between 10,000 welcome to AA / NA keytags, being sold to the groups, for every ONE 20 years drug free medallion....

So for everyone of me, there are like 100,000 who have sailed themselves into the garbage bins of life.....

To me, your loser retarded opinons, do not count for anything.

The majority of people in AA freely give me their disapproval....

Haaaaaaaa Haaaaaaa Haaaaaa The majority of the Gossiping, Retarded Arsehole, LOSERS in AA relapse......

You bring your relapses upon yourselves and your bring it upon each other....

AA is in serious decline... I saw the trustees report that they alluded to the fact that because the insurance companies are no longer paying for the rehab revolving doors, not enough fresh members are being recruited by the AA cultists, to make up for the churn rate and relapse rate of AA, and without enough unpaid workers to make all the literature sales to the newcomers, who then do not become more unpaid workers, AA is facing insolvency. AA is becoming bankrupt.

So for the most part, your all going to die using.",0

Hi all, im fairly new to this subreddit and I need advice/help. 
I have a friend, we'll call her j for now.
For as long as I've been attending the same school as her, (about a year or so), shes always had a vape or bugged me for mine. (Yes i know i can get in trouble but im 18 and nicotine isnt the problem here) we met through a group of friends my now fiance was a part of with her. We all added each other on snapchat and started our own little group chat. I keep tabs on all my friends because I like to know how each of them are mentally and physically because im kind of a parent of the group but i digress. 


As soon as we all added each other we were able to see each others stories and hers were... illicit to say the least. Video after video of her smoking pot or drinking with her at the time boyfriend and the guy would change almost weekly but something told me to stay out of it. 
A few times they were less druggie and more sad because she'd broken up with her then boyfriend but then the cycle would begin again.
Keep in mind she's 16 and none of this should be even possible because her mom is super strict about everything.
 I lived with them for about a month or so since my parents were in a bad spot and since im 18 i saw myself as a financial strain but while i was there all she would do is stay in her room. Shed send me snaps of her smoking cigarettes and even joint  in her bedroom but i never took any interest in her. Fast forward through an good two months of no posting or follow ups and i started to worry. I got in touch with her brother and all i got from him was she had broken her phone. I would say I believed that if i knew she was broke but she had a good stable job and could buy basically anything a normal 16 year old would want. Including a new phone.
 Fast forward about a week and the same stuff starts happening again but instead of being in her room or the backyard she was driving around the city with guy after guy with either a beer bottle or a one-hitter in hand. I tried to step in as subtly as I could by asking her to be safer and to at least try to get clean but i was quickly told to ""fuck off"" and ""mind my own business"". I talked to her mom and her mom was adamant that she knew j would never do anything like that. Then i get a text yesterday from my fiance that j had started on pills. I wasnt as surprised as I would like to have been but i saw this coming. 
She was on her snapchat not 5 minutes later flashing the pills and vodka her new man had bought for her. She held the bottle close enough that i could make out the name and dosage and it stopped me dead in my tracks.
Oxycodone 500mg.
I don't want to lose my friend to an overdose but the only way she'd even listen is if the law was involved. I don't want to but it seems like its my only choice. Shes still with this guy as far as i know so hes probably the one getting her the pills. What do i do?",1

My mother has a prescription drug problem and in the last year I have found both meth and cocaine in her purse and most recently just sitting out on the kitchen counter. I got a family full of addicts, uncle, cousins, brother (now 3 years sober üëçüèº) and my father. Each time she has blamed my dad or some other addict that comes around. It‚Äôs been an easy excuse for her, although a lot of the time in the past it has been there‚Äôs. But not these few times. I‚Äôve known for many years my mom has abused prescription drugs, but I never believed she‚Äôs using these other drugs. It‚Äôs also never been very obvious because for years she‚Äôs ran successful businesses and doesn‚Äôt show normal signs. But in the past 4 years she‚Äôs completely deteriorated. Her health is worse than it‚Äôs ever been. She only has 4 teeth left, half of her face is falling off. Her Dailey routine consist of waking up at 12, and not getting any of her responsibilities done, and then staying up until 3 or 4 every night cleaning or doing arts and crafts or some shit. But my mom has always had these unhealthy routines because for 16 years my brothers addictions drove her into the ground. She stayed up late chasing him around door to door, dealer to dealer trying to save his life. Leading her to meet connections. Idk where she is getting the drugs from. My other brother recently passed away 4 months ago in a Harley accident. She claimed she needed cocaine in order to get through the funeral and days to follow. My brothers passing has caused a lot of pain so please don‚Äôt jump on me for saying this but it‚Äôs also been an excuse for her. It‚Äôs a complicated position to try and come back to addressing her addictions once she throws losing her son back in my face. But these problems started long before his death and my dad is a waste and my step dad is 75. So I want my mom to be around in the years to come. To meet my kids one day, married etc. I‚Äôm only 22. When I try to talk to her in this way, being sentimental and sensitive we get no where either. What do you do when it gets to this point? It was different dealing with my brother and dad because they were constantly stealing from me, abusing me, ODing multiple times. But my mom is constantly doing things for me. She‚Äôs my best friend. We talk everyday, I tell her everything. I really depend on her and I‚Äôd like to try to do everything I can before cutting her out of my life too. My brother who is a recovering addict is no help. It‚Äôs infuriating to me. He‚Äôs afraid of her. Maybe it‚Äôs because he knows it‚Äôs useless idk. She ran around saving his life for 16 years but he can‚Äôt put in five minutes to do the same for her. So once again everything falls back onto me.  Need some advice guys!",1

I'll take some adderall to help with school work or I'll take kratom for a few days to get through my stressful job, or I'll chug a 40 oz before I play vidya. I feel like I have my brain back but I'm just having trouble grasping 100% sobriety, which is 100% necessary for my career choice. If I can quit meth, heroin and habitual weed, why can't I break through these lasting impulses? The urges just get so incredibly strong, it feels impossible to fight them even though the substances I periodically take now are far less severe than the substances I used to take almost daily. I've never been to rehab because i can't afford it/ no insurance. I made it this far by myself. Has anyone else experienced this when trying to get totally clean? Were you guys able to power through it on your own volition?

I turn 28 in July and I don't want to still be relying on anything at that point.",8

My wife and friends are all extremely supportive and whenever I choose to talk about slipping up, the conversation is about why I didn‚Äôt reach out when I got tempted in the first place and it‚Äôs almost always me thinking I could just have the one drink and quit, or that I got in over my head and slipped up, got embarrassed and tried to hide it because I got ashamed.

Lately it dawned on me that every time I relapse (usually following several months or a year of sobriety) it comes after assuming I will ever stop being an alcoholic, or when I believe that I‚Äôm better to some degree and can just say no to the habit.

I cant, and it seems like if I‚Äôm gonna be real with myself, I‚Äôm never gonna be able think I can have healthy drinking habits, and that this will always be a struggle to some capacity.

How do you not feel ashamed, disappointed, and frankly not like a loser knowing that life will mean knowing that drinking will always become a problem and that it can‚Äôt be negotiated, particularly when people around you can do it healthily?",9

I myself am not an addict, a few years ago I did have a cocaine dependency but it was easy to kick that habit pretty quickly. On the other hand, my brother who is 3 years older than me and has a newborn baby has an opioid addiction. He began doing Xanax, percocet and morphine pills around 16, then it had progressed right infront of our eyes and our family had no idea. At this time now he‚Äôs a heroine and fentanyl addict. For as long as this has been happening, he‚Äôs turned into a liar, a thief and a terrible person. He‚Äôs not the guy I remember him being. It has torn my family apart and I completely resent him for what he‚Äôs done to us. My parents put him into rehab, costing $15 000 and somehow, a patient had snuck fentanyl in there and that blew my brothers sobriety. Currently he‚Äôs living at home with my and my parents and we have to keep every door locked, we have taken away all means of communication and internet access from him. We feel like prisoners in our own home but at this point we have run out of options.

I am 267 days clean now. I was in a recovery house for two and a half months, then went to treatment for three months, and came back to the recovery house at Christmas 2019.
I was supposed to move out of the recovery house close to the end of next April 2020 because they only give a person six months to stay here and that will be up. 
But the Covid-19 pandemic has kept the house under fairly strict isolation rules, and I'm grateful for them. I have been looking for work and an apartment or room to rent, but the isolation situation has made that more difficult than ever. They have given me an assurance that I won't be kicked out without anywhere to go. 
I haven't left the property for 15 days now. All recovery meetings (AA, NA, CODA) have been cancelled until further notice, I am definitely feeling that. I haven't tried the online ones yet but that's the logical thing to do.

I thought for the longest time that I could handle this but I can't. The little slip ups are all too easy and I always find a justification for them. I'm a poly addict. Main vices being kratom, alcohol, weed, and occasionally lortab. For well over a year now I've tried to go 1 month sober and have been unable. The longest I've made it was 2 weeks on 2 occasions. My addiction is not destroying my life. I am a functioning addict but it is preventing me from achieving goals and making progress. I keep a journal (main focus of which being my addiction) and have yearly, monthly, and weekly goals. They all take a back seat though. Getting my fix always comes first before anything else.

So I've been researching and contacting therapists for a week now looking to set something up. I basically need someone to open up to about this shit and hold me accountable for my actions. Another problem I have, despite knowing that my addictions hold me back, is not being ready to quit everything 100%. My family and friends drink during social occasions and I have no problems hanging out and having a few with them. My problem is when I'm at home drinking alone. Also kratom. It's great when I have a lot to get done or need a little boost because I'm tired or unmotivated. But then I start using it as a crutch and take it everyday. In the back of my mind I still feel like moderate use is an achievable goal. However from reading this sub it seems like moderation is not possible for most addicts. Or it takes a tremendous amount of discipline that I currently lack. I don't want to quit forever but at the same time I'm tired of this problem consuming me. I'm going to remain stagnant as long as catching a buzz is my number 1 priority. I want to get this one month under my belt but beyond that, I don't know. I should probably go longer just can't fathom it.

Im just venting here. Back to my original question. What can I expect out of therapy sessions? How did they work for you? Especially if you are a poly addict I'd like to hear about your experience.",6

I wasn't forced to stop taking it, no one asked me to or even suggested it, but I woke up one morning shortly after my job shutting down due to Covid 19 thinking that as shitty as things are in the world right now, maybe it's the only time where I won't be living a cycle that I've been stuck in for quite a while of buying something, whether that be opiates or suboxone or methadone or Xanax just so I can be well enough to go to work to make money to buy more drugs so I can go to work to make money, you get the point.

I've thought a lot these past few days, but mostly been insanely surprised at how mild the withdrawal symptoms are, when I've gone through withdrawals plenty of times, from less than what I've been taking and been fine with for months now, and the symptoms were much worse. I've decided there are more than likely a couple of reasons for that. Reason 1) this is the first time I've truly decided on my own that it was time to do this instead of having the loss of my children as the main driving factor, unfortunately, that was enough to get me clean, not enough to keep me clean (I honestly can't say I'll stay clean this time, I'm just saying the withdrawal is different) 2) Its also the first time I've decided to get clean that I'm not sitting in a government housing apartment surrounded by all of my drug addicted friends doing and/or selling my DOC and I'm actually at a pretty good place mentally and physically.

I do think having a pretty long moment of not having to worry about work helps too, I just thought it was a really good time. I'm not saying it's been a walk in the park and I feel great three days in, I'm just saying it's better than past withdrawals have been for me.

I'm not saying anyone else should try to take this time of being told to stay at home to do the same, but I do think that a lot of us are tired, a lot of us are still dying and it's not due to the corona virus, a lot of us are still putting ourselves at risk so we can get our meds or get our fix, and maybe some of us can take this moment to try to take our lives back from the still very real opiate epidemic. Maybe we could stop watching so many of our far too young friends die.

Thanks for listening, wherever you are in your life, good luck and I hope you're okay.

I had a   model Bobby Labonte, green, Interstate Battery, NASCAR. I was never a big fan of NASCAR, but my dad was and he bought me that car, along with others alike. But that one was my favorite. One day I decided to build a ramp on my kitchen floor right in front of the steps leading to the basement. I rolled the car as fast as I could across the floor, and off the ramp it went. It flew down the stairs crashing hard into the cement basement floor. Like today I didn‚Äôt think about the repercussions of my actions, It never once crossed my mind that this would destroy the car. I just simply wanted to do it. And that was all the convincing I have ever needed to do anything in my life. I have always put very little thought into the consequences of my actions. When I saw the wheels fly of the car, I knew I had broken my favorite toy. At first I thought maybe I‚Äôll be able to just pop them back on. But when I took a closer look, I saw the plastic was broken. Meaning there was no fixing it. My stomach dropped and I ran to my dad in hopes of him buying me a new one. He  told me he wouldn‚Äôt and that I needed to start thinking before I acted. I was devastated I had this hopeless feeling like it was broken forever and I‚Äôd never get it back. That feeling is so familiar now. I constantly feel like I‚Äôve broken myself and there is no amount of begging or manipulating or tinkering that would fix my broken brain. It just always seems so impossible, to get myself to be happy again, to be free of this giant gorilla on my back weighing me down. Addiction is something I wouldn‚Äôt wish on my worst enemies. It is  truly crippling. And I don‚Äôt know what to do....I want to be free but the hill to climb just seems so very impossible.

I have long had the idea in my head to write a blog about my problems with addiction, and how in the end I managed to overcome them. Since I was not entirely sure of how to go about this and with my end goal of getting some things off my chest and helping others I thought this would be a good place to start.

It all started with alcohol, I wish I could tell 23 years old me how much alcohol would be a gateway to the next almost 8 years of my life and how it would begin a struggle and personal battle which at some points I was not even sure I was involved in. 

Some background I had recently moved country (Germany to spain) and found myself living in a new culture as a scuba instructor one which involved hanging out with our students every day after work and as the Spanish do drinking a lot of beers, 1 beer a day soon turned into 4 and then 6. But everything was fine right?. I remember once counting and it was 120+ days in a row I had drunk 4 or more beers. Did i realize i had a problem **no.**

From there, things started to escalate I started taking what I considered to be party drugs and I suppose believed that this was not really a problem, everyone else in the club taking ecstasy and cocaine somehow validated my actions and made them explainable to myself.

This then leads to a three-year slippery downslope were my once a month party night became tri-weekly and eventually getting to the lowest 6 months of my life at which point I dread to think the number of weeks that passed when I was taking 6 - 10g of cocaine per week and most worryingly working as normal pretending everything was okay and being able to function whilst heavily sleep deprived and under the effects of all of these drugs.

To free myself from my own personal hell I ended my relationship of 3 years, changed my entire friendship group and tried to get professional help. In the end, I quit my job and moved to a completely different part of the country.

I'm now 8 months clean, and somehow feel like I'm on the road to recovery. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone has and hope someone reading this might find it helpful in someway.",2

I also cut out sugar. Learning the habit of saying no, and not having to fight over the decision. So far so good.

So the other day was the my 3 year anniversary. My DOC was Xanax, but I used other opiods, alcohol, and weed very excessively. I honestly never thought I would see this day, but if I can anyone can. I could go on with war stories but I‚Äôm sure thats not gonna help anyone. To whoever is out there struggling right now, I promise you this gets better and that youll be able to live drug free. I was a very heavy drug user, and in a lot of peoples eyes I was a lost cause. I lost friends, family and a lot of other very important stuff that I thought didn‚Äôt matter to me, but today life is good. The only drug I use now is Nicotine and thats gonna go tomorrow or the next day. Recovery is scary and can be very tough, but my toughest days in recovery have still managed to be better than my toughest days in addiction. If anyone needs any help or words of encouragement please feel free to dm me. Adios Y Vaya Con Dios friends!",14
