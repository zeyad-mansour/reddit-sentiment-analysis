I was thinking about addiction. Usually (with exceptions of course) people get addicted to food, drugs, alcohol, etc. after some trauma.

The body and brain make you do this. So I understand when someone is 300 kg and cannot stop eating or is a drug addict. The body goes in self destructive mode and it’s very hard to get out of it. Most of the times you just can’t, the urge to do these stuff is very strong.

So my question is why the body does that? This is incredibly smart machine that calculates million processes. It is designed to stay alive and survive, it does everything to fix the bugs and yet when something horrible happens it just want to kill itself, it cannot cope with the situation no matter how smart it is. 

May you share with me your thoughts, I am very interested to know why it does that.

Posted somewhat recently about my struggles with cocaine use, and I am happy to say things are going really well in that regard. I haven't used cocaine since Dec 2nd. I am curious about y'alls experience though...

I have been smoking a lot of weed daily and drinking often (and when I do I drink it's quite a bit, and often alone) since. For a while I told myself I was giving myself some slack for getting off the coke. A month later though I find myself smoking weed as soon as I wake up in the morning, and when I drink, which is increasingly often, I stay feeling semi-drunk/feeling good? all day until I go to bed. 

There really isn't much to do rn because of the pandemic, and I don't have responsibilities I am sacrificing. I haven't really been seeing many people though, and I feel like I'm isolating though so I can drink and smoke and coast through the day until I can go to bed again. 

I guess I just worry, with past addiction issues and the tendency to use to cope with emotions, that I am replacing addictions and falling into another trap of justification and denial. 

Has anyone experienced something similar? Especially with the pandemic and the forced isolation, who feels they've been using substances to pass the time?",2,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8635578751564026}"

Addiction is a hard thing to beat and no one should ever have to go through the hardest thing ever alone. You can beat addiction and even if you relapse it’s ok. It doesn’t matter what life throws at you. It only matters how you react to it. You are not alone and people do care about you. If you feel alone you are not. I hope everyone dealing with addiction gets the willpower to get help but it is not easy. I believe everyone here is strong enough to beat what they are going through and none of this is your fault. You are not a bad person for doing drugs or getting addicted. It is not your fault for not being able to stop. Everyone has a little good in them and drugs can destroy you as a person but you can always get better. I believe in you and I believe that it’s not your time to go or give up. Giving up on your addiction will only waste more time in life.

I kept them like fireflys, i didn't know they'd let go now I'm completely disconnecting.

I want not to think, to not care, not to feel.
Another year swirls down the drain,  the paint is drying into the cracks of faces, rusted.
Another decade, another square.
Another broken soul, and many more dead friends with dead ends.

Another forgotten memory surfaced, like another lifeless body drifting on the sea tops. 
It's easier to forgive than forget, but can I do either?

I am my own personal hell. 
I am caged within a diseased lung coughing, choking on the shit I spew.
I live charred, black, out to every last strand of cilia, singed, bare, unrepairable from the self destructed damage I choose inhale.

The damage i can't forget. I did the lot of it.
Oh i how I love the sweet taste of a slow death, the nicotine sticks, in the home i created here.
In my caged lung I line the walls with each tooth that falls from my gums. With ease I laugh until one by one im full-and my teeth cover this castle of hell made from the diseased lungs, &yellowed, abscessed teeth I created.

The house is alive, hardly and stealing sleep from me.

I've been floating, I still wonder if i will be ok. 
Drained, leaves start to snap under the patter of my steps. 
Branches become so naked, air crisp.
""Is this even real? Are these arms mine?""
If i will Ever feel home, or like I belong anywhere is a constant concern. 
 ......

I cant relate to others.
I just dont relate like I had
....
.

If it's true, i am impossible to love now more than ever.
I'm on fire, my hand-to-face it's hot, i shiver, cry.
I don't understand.
Why destroying anything that tries to genuinely care is easier.
Give up.
Like a wounded animal, i dont know how. 
I push forward, bleeding out then back into the seasons as time surely gets the best of me again and April showers pour out from  eyes.
....
.
.
.

Can someone put me out of my own misery?
We are animals, after all- & I am the runt. 
....
.
Let the trees die so the cold dead snow can creep back up, crunching with each step, crying in the dark looking up- the white flakes fall from the sky in front of a street light. 
I remember the beauty. I remember the hollow feelings that followed.
Swallow it. Swallow it. 
It didn't happen if i dont remember.  

....
.
.
I am condemned to be alone, rightfully so. 
My own personal curse.
For I've become impossible to love. 
I'm bitter inside a thin sweet shell.
Deception they will claim, as the sweetness begins to fade into distaste for all.
Soured, spoiled, gone bad for good this time.

....
.
.

I'm lost again, it's me i know.
I am scared of myself again, how everything just crumbles to dust in my trembling hands.
How pathetic yet so typical. 
.....
.
.
How when something is right in front of my face but the paths cross then miss each time.
.....
.
.
My timing is off, the ticking is an echo inside my chest. 
Everything is passing- I dont know how-to change.
Life does change like the weather outside, years pass by so fast I can't process any of it.
I just want to
Be okay.
Understand but it's too late
The sun will keep rising with the passing days but will I live to breathe the summer air like I once had again.? Or appreciate the way the pastels blur in the dewy morning along Midwest skies.?
.....
.
.
I hope these waves sync up or crash soon because its all just too much to bare. 
....
.

Or have I completely rotted from the inside out? 
Either way incomplete is all ive ever known.

it seems like i HAVE to spend money every single day or else i just don't feel complete or something. i was not looking to buy anything today. there's nothing i necessarily needed right now. but today i ended up spending $200. 

i noticed that i actively look for things to buy, constantly, and this usually happens when i'm bored. i am isolating (got covid) and have been extra bored, but this isn't really an excuse because even when i wasn't isolating i still spent just as much money. i would go into target or any other store with nothing i needed to buy. i went in LOOKING for something to buy. and always walked out with a bunch of stuff. 

i have a job but it's not enough for me to reasonably be spending this much. $14 an hour, and even worse is that i'm not even working right now because i have covid so i haven't been making money. 

to really give an example of how bad it is, my bank account is LESS than what i had BEFORE i got my job. i'm spending way more than i'm making and i fear the day that i will go bankrupt and in debt.

please, if there is anyone out there who has gone through the same as me, i'm begging for tips or advice on stopping. i've had a lot of people tell me to simply ""tell yourself you don't need it"" but it's not very effective. because my thought process always goes ""i can just make up for it with my next check"" or ""i'll save my next checks and not spend for two months"" but i never live up to those words. i am desperate and really ashamed of myself.",1,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9997171759605408}"

Reflecting on my narcissistic tendencies has been extraordinarily humbling. Willingly looking at myself with open eyes and analyzing every behavior is a thing of beauty, and also terrifying.

The grooming, the lying, the orchestrating, the betrayal, the lack of empathy, and every other terrible thing that goes with it. Clawing past the bravado of my unbreakable confidence, I find that I have very little confidence about very few things. As someone who loves paying attention to people patterns (a groomer trait) this fascinates me as much as it feels bad to admit to myself. The one thing I have 100% confidence in is being able to dust off and get back up.

I went down a dark path. I betrayed the woman I love the most. So far she has forgiven me, but the facade is broken for both of us. We both proceed with caution. Building trust again, brick by brick. Going towards her is my only direction, knowing she has the option of many directions that would keep her safer than she is with me.

As a narcissist, perspective is difficult, and so is self-reflection. What's in the mirror can be very ugly, but these past 60 days have been the most honest, beautiful days of my adult life. I would rather look in the mirror and see ugly and true over handsome and false. ""The Beast"" over ""Mr. Grey"".

I, as a atheïst, really struggle with the whole higher power thing. How can I believe that a higher power can restore me to sanity (step 2)? How can I turn my life towards God (step 3)? How can God remove my character defects (step 6 & 7) if I don't believe in a God? 


I've downloaded the You Bible app and tried reading daily, but I just don't believe in it. Tried reading the Quran, but still the same thing. Don't believe any of it. Don't believe in the idea of a God. Don't believe in karma. Tried learning about Hinduism, but still the same, don't believe in any of it. 

So I feel lost. I feel like there's an admission test for NA (being religious), and I've failed miserably. 


The way I see it, no higher power can turn my life around. Only me. I have to put in the work. Nobody can be clean for me. Nobody is going to payoff my debt for me. Not the government, not God, not my family, only me.


Any atheïst/agnostic who have a similar experience? The whole God thing is a huge turndown for me

As did the rest of the world. Whatever.

In my little world it's been a Rollercoaster. 

Early 2019 I let go of family when I got with my boyfriend.

I'd tell you the details of my past but its long. Just know that it wasn't fun. I was abused sexually by my father. No one believed me. Was blamed for everyone in my household having a medical issue. Abused physically by my father and siblings.

Got into drugs.

Od a few times. Sometimes purposeful.

But I met my bestfriend. He saved my life countless times. As I saved his. Loved him since the day we met. We both got on drugs and partied. But I grew out of it after a while. Got a job and paid for everything in my family. Got beat up by my father and kicked out and took care of everything while living with a boyfriend I met while working.

My bestfriend became my boyfriend 2019. Left my ex for him.He had just gotten out jail and rehab. We moved in together.. it was amazing. Told me he was on meth when he got locked up but he was good. Told my mom I couldn't take care of the family anymore.i had to take care of myself in this new place. And she deserted me.

I was worthless.

Time goes on. Struggling. Whatever. Adult woes.

But happy, until my boyfriend got picked up again for a failed drug test. He got back on meth

I didn't know.

I tried meth to see why he chose that over a life with me.

Got off it.

Moved in with his father I knew as long as I knew my boyfriend.

November 4, 2019 : His father raped me. 

I lost the last bit of myself.


Earlier this year, 2020, I found out his father wasn't being charged. But my boyfriends entire family sees me as a whore. 

I started hanging out with our old friends. Indulged in my addiction for a few months. I was on highs and lows. Angry and confused. I wanted to get away from this world.

I felt alone.


As of recent, or at least the last couple of months I stopped hanging out and working 2 jobs. I've been trying to see help with everything in my life. I've been contemplating suicide. But I was sober.

It's the first time since I was 13/14 years old I didn't want to do drugs. I just wanted to get help. It's been hell. I have a good job. My boyfriend...now fiancé is actually going through the program and growing into the man I knew he could be.

I told my friend a couple days prior to Christmas eve that I wanted to come out but no drugs. It wasn't going to be good for my mental issues or ptsd. I didn't want to mess up my job. I don't want to go on a binge. Especially with my drug of choice.

I may be feeling suicidal. (Like mulling around the thought. Wanting to make the bad thoughts go away and the bad things to stop coming my way.)
But not right now. 

They demanded me to buy them drugs. All night. I told them I mentally wasn't there for it.. I didn't want to make a mistake I couldn't take back.. lose my job if I lived through this day.. constantly said no. On Christmas morning it was brought up again. 

MIND YOU THEY DIDNT HAVE MONEY TO THROW IN.. BUT 'WE' COULD HAVE GOTTEN A 1/4 FOR 200.

They didn't even get me a present.

When I spoke up about how I felt about everything with someone I thought was my friend, I was told I wasn't shit basically. That they did nothing wrong. 

It was a joke. But if I think they're fake friends I don't have to come around.

Idk why I wrote all of this. And maybe I just needed to let this go. But im hurt that that's all I am.

To anyone. I'm just someone to take advantage of. Someone that can pay for everything. And when I say no. Whether there was a reason behind it or not...it doesn't matter. They didn't care. 

I just wish people would care. And I'm not dense. I know that people sober/ getting sober/ in recovery shouldn't be around people on drugs. And yes you realize who your real friends are when you're the individual that doesn't want to partake. 

But these are people that have known my fiancé and I since we were all teens. Went through similar issues. I just thought things were different.

We've been really lucky to get quick acccess to a psychiatrist and just yesterday she voluntarily entered an in-patient facility.

I thought my place was cleared out of any drugs, but low and behold I found my old mirror with a decent amount of china white heroin residue on it. even though I chose to go to treatment for benzos/heroin by myself and want to be sober, I still couldn't bare to throw out that residue. 

so I scraped it up and did some and quickly knew I made a big mistake. my tolerance was super low and I got really high, almost too high. my mom called me in this time and it was so awkward and I feel really bad about it. 

I managed to throw the rest out and clean off the mirror with rubbing alcohol. 

it definitely wasn't worth it, ruined my sober streak as I was so close to my goal of 100 days, and I feel even worse than before.

I doubt anyone’s going to see this, but I’m in a bad place, depressed yes, ptsd yes, anxiety yes..

I can’t stop doing drugs, it’s just cocaine I use, but I use heavily

it’s not that I take a lot, but as soon as I have some I just will not sleep until I drink something strong enough to knock me out or smoke 100000 joints to knock me out

I usually stay awake for 2-3 days, without eating or drinking anything apart from alcohol.

I can feel my bodies suffering and probably won’t last much longer, but even though I know this, I still continue to do it, at any opportunity

99% of my money goes towards weed and coke, and I still manage to get in debt.

I tick coke I know I can’t pay and just ignore literally everyone, it was only last week I spent 4 straight days in my bedroom, sniffing drinking, smoking, didn’t speak to another person for the 4 days, I just locked myself away. 

The drugs also cause major major paranoia, like its 4 in the mourning and The volume on the tv is on 3 and any noise I hear I overthink and panic. 

Yet I still continue to do it, I’m fully addicted and have no clue how to basically save my life. 

I know I haven’t got long left, but yet I don’t care, the only reason why I wouldn’t want to die is because I don’t want to put my family and friends through that sort of thing. 

Me and my mum found my Nan dead 2-3 months ago, blood everywhere, and I had to check her pulse and her eyes were wide open and it felt like she looked through me into my soul. That’s not something I want to put on my family.

I don’t even know why I’m posting this on here, but everything I’ve just said, I’ve never spoke to anyone about, and just the thought that someone who I don’t know could read this kinda puts me at ease.

I (33M) have been drinking almost every day for the past 16 years. I told myself it gave me energy and confidence, and helped control my anxiety and depression. In reality I used it to hide my emotions in order to avoid getting hurt. For the past several years I have been very close with a girl, fwb situation. She expressed several times she wanted to make it official, but I wasn't letting her in. She never complained about my drinking, and honestly probably didn't know the extent of it. 

Well lately my feeling were getting out of control as I realised she was everything I needed and I could finally shake the booze and hang out with her sober. So I drank less, and then stopped. I proceeded to ask her out, and she said yes! Unfortunately she had other guys in her life I wasn't aware of, and things got complicated fast. We discussed our feelings for a few days and she ended up saying she needs space to figure things out.

As hard as it was I agreed to give her space. Now here I am, sober, no woman I love, not even my best friend and closest confidant I had before. Drinking filled all my time before. Feeding my OCD and getting me to diligently clean the house etc.. now without her I lost my gaming buddy, my daily texting friend, my lover.. and my fall back is sitting on the shelf with a cork in it. Not drinking is difficult, but not texting her is twice as hard. It's dead cold of winter, and everything is shut down for covid. All my friends and family are big drinkers, and it's difficult to be with them and not fall back on the bottle. 

Any suggestions on how to keep myself distracted, with out using alcohol and weed, my go to distractions? Any advice on how to not intrude her space when I ignorantly believe I can ""fix things"" by texting her? I appreciate anything you have to share..

This whole BS that anyone who struggles with drugs and alcohol is an ""addict"" or ""alcoholic"" and that they're sick forever is just crap.  
We know SO much more about this whole condition and all of the underlying factors that matter but people are STILL so resistant to medication, or alternative treatments or ANYTHING that doesn't follow the ""quit forever, pray to god and hope for the best"" approach.

Last Christmas I spent it at a treatment Center and for many years prior either in addiction or working. 

I was very down last year Christmas Day watching on FaceTime as my children opened their Christmas gifts. Pretending that i participated in buying them, even though I didn’t as I had no money. I was healing as I still am but guilt and shame is my downfall as most of us who finally realize the destruction we left in our downward spirals. 

Christmas Day yesterday I got to spend a couple of hours with my kids as they came to see me where I’m staying. We exchanged gifts. 

When it came time to open my gift I was shocked to see it was a build a bear. I was surprised. I’m a grown man... why in the world would my kids get me a teddy bear. I took it out of the box and thought it was very cute that they actually went out together to go make it for me. They then told me to squeeze it’s hand. As I grabbed it’s hand I got to hear their voices come out of this bear saying “We love you daddy”   Words I wasn’t expecting to hear. I almost broke down but was able to shake it off with just a smile and unreleased tears. 

I celebrated 10 months clean and sober December 23rd. 

I have had many birthdays and Christmas’s over the years and the greatest gift I can think is this little talking teddy bear.  

Now I just got to name him. I’m thinking maybe “Red”. Short for redemption 💕

2020-12-27 15:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/klagzz/one_year_sober/,One year sober!,"Yesterday marked one year of sobriety. Last year, when I went to detox to withdrawal from Methadone, I unknowingly bought a ticket to places and things I thought were unreachable for me. On this journey, I’ve found happiness. Not a fleeting sensation brought on by “love” or the acquisition of any object, but a sustainable wholeness within myself. I found that elusive self-confidence that for my entire life escaped me. The sacred, apathetic, and nihilistic based thinking has begun dissipating and is replaced with self-worth and care. Not only for myself but for others also.
There is something amazing about coming to the realization that I have something to offer the world, and to be fortunate enough to be of use. It’s been a wild ride. My mother died from alcoholism; about 5 months into sobriety. I called others and cried in meetings. I needed to be vulnerable. I used to think I was a special snowflake with an immeasurable pain that others couldn’t comprehend. The truth is I just never talked about the way I felt. As a result, I closed myself off from the world. Through recovery, I’ve found a way to relate to everyone and my world opened up in a way I never thought possible.

There is a lot of work still to be done. I am often lazy, I still vape, and over eat. But as I've seen it's progress not perfection. I've lost 50lbs over this year from light exercise and not eating (as much) ice cream. I signed up for and passed 3 classes (71.8 in spanish but I'm proud of that C). And I'm daily, sometimes every minute, looking out for future me by making better choices.

He is an amazing person with such potential, and everything I want in a partner when he is sober. I became aware of his past and present struggles with addiction to a combo of opiates, speed, and alcohol about 3 months into our relationship. 3 months ago he relapsed on meth and was honest with me about it. I basically told him that he needed to get some help, and if it continued I was leaving him. After that, he was sober as far as I knew, things got better. He moved in with myself and my 2 daughters. He’s expressed to me and his mother that we are his way out of his old life. Though has yet to seek help. Recently he’s been so distant, and has been going to his apartment that he’s been slowly moving out of more often. 

After weeks of his changed behaviors, Tonight we had a huge fight, he was gone most of the day, came home and went to sleep, til I woke him to eat dinner. He then said he was going to stay at his apartment again. Unfortunately I blew up on him, begging him to stay and trying to understand why he doesn’t want anything to do with me. He left without his phone and hasn’t come home. Unfortunately I went through his phone. I know it’s not okay but I just needed to know what’s going on. His google search history was full of “how to detox from heroin on my own” etc.

2020-12-27 03:44:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kl0dw7/surrendering_is_difficult/,Surrendering is difficult.,"Throughout life I've built my entire identity around drugs. Not only have I enjoyed taking them and getting high, but I'm also one of those nerds who likes to explore drugs and has an interest in other aspects of drug use/abuse. I like to read about the pharmacology, chemistry, biology and what have you not of drugs. 

The fact that this has been a long and loved interest of mine, makes it really hard to let go of.

I've been addicted to heroin/opioids for 15 years, benzos for many years as well, and I'd love to let go of that destructive addiction. Currently I'm clean of both, but I find it extremely difficult to surrender completely, letting go of that identity wich I have spend a lifetime creating.

It's not exactly that I don't want to, my addiction is killing me day by day. I think it's more a matter of me being scared, because what am I without? Creating a new identity from scratch just seems so overwhelming and nearly impossible.

I don't like people, usually they don't like me much either, so I just isolate myself from others. I enjoy my own company, so it doesn't matter much, but it gets rough and lonely at times. My interest in drugs has kind of taken over and filled the gap for many years of lacking human interaction, with something else to occupy my mind.

I'm certain, that if I don't change my ways, if I don't learn to let people in and/or socialize with them, recovery will probably never be possible, but I don't know how to strip away that identity?

Many say when the consequences of using becomes greater than the benefits, you are ready for a change, but I've been on my knees so many times, been through it all and lost everyone and everything to my addiction, and yet I find it difficult to surrender.

Story -- 
It's a long one, the story of how I quit smoking, but I want to share, so let me 'Roll' this story for you guys 😄 , if it can help u achieving it..

..for me, few things coincided and ..(may be) resulted in a mind hack..

After an accident and Tendon surgery of right index finger, I read on web that quitting smoking is a must for faster recovery ( ..smoking can delay Tendon recovery by Months!).

Saw this as a good opportunity to quit smoking, as it was in the back of my mind for quite some time after 15 plus years of smoking.

But, funnily enough, when I spoke to the Dr who did the surgery in my next regular visit, he said yah you can quit smoking but it won't matter in my case. And, as it's unrelated to the effect of surgery he performed, I can enjoy smoking as for as he is concerned..
 ..and he also said to surely quit Googling so much medical in web.. as, that's more dangerous, lol (ahhh.. may be he is ""A Good Doctor"" for some, he later gave me an opiot to survive very painful physio saying that, you know, ""the Pain exists only in your mind"" .. lol 😃)


..And there went my first useless would-have-been-a-mind-hack attempt -- I thought Dr telling me all what I was researching and just wanted a doctor to tell me, would do the hack.

So , this was NOT how i quit smoking.. that part is in story below... :D

Few days later, I thought, f**k the Dr, I want to quit and it should be enough without a Dr helping me make my mind..

That week, in that city I was living, there was an International Air Show I was going to attend , and this made me wake up early one day as we needed to drive and be there early morning to the Air Show..

..That day, before sunrise I had my last puff, dint feel good (may be smoking first thing in the morning was never my thing), and that moment i thought this may be my last puff..

..I din't just think.. ..i Intended.. 
...And then i also pushed this intention to the universe. Intention.

Now, what I think did the hack/trick was -- that AirShow, it was something which I experienced very first time in my life that day, to the point , it made me really overwhelmed.. 
..imagine Rafael doing somersaults and whatnot and flying upside down just above your head.. that aerobatics, that roaring sound of Fighter Jet engine whose vibration you can feel in your heart, which can sink enemy's heart with fear, ..and all that overwhelm..

It all felt like statements of intentions, intentions of people like me, intentions manifesting with so much energy and roar..

I can't express that feeling , it was a very strange but strong cocktail of proud , anger , fulfilment , achievement , knowing all that u can achieve anything, let go, forgive (yourself / all ), and what not..( sorry, at this point, the words start straying away from the meaning i want to convey and start spoiling the feelings I want to express..)

..May be it was also mix of knowing that I am never fully going to gain the fine control of the figure I had that Tendon surgery on, may it was that traumatic experience with surgery and painful physio and all.. that crazy cocktail of various states of mind.

...And in all that super overwhelmed state, somewhere in the back of my mind I was constantly feeling and narrating, that, life is beautiful, u really don't need that smoke, it's just psychological, let go what is not even needed in life..

...may be that ovewhelming display of ""power of intentions"" going around me in that Air Show in all its full glory, resonated something, some part of my mind and cemented the smoking-quitting decision so hard somewhere deep inside my subconsciousness, that , I not only quit smoking that day, but to my own shock, I never felt an urge to smoke from inside, not even that day , not even next day, not even till now, ever since after more that 3.5 years, ...and i even feel bad seeing someone smoke..

Strange huh, how mind works.. that's what I called a mind hack which coincidently happend with me and worked for me..

...this is my conclusion, because I kept asking myself what the f**k actually happened? how it worked?? What really changed?? ..and how it can be applied in other situations?

only problem is replicating this -- I don't know how can someone Plan to be crushed by A Rafael of Emotions (pun intended.. ) and align so many environmental factors to go this state change deep inside mind..

..Not possible, right??
..may be that's why some therapy needs well-wishers who can simulate those coincidences.. may be..

But, one thing is possible, and depends only on you -- intending -- that is not environmental , it's up to you..

 ..it's a very powerful tool, once you intend , seems the subconscious aligns itself, to automatically prompt your conscious mind towards the right actions towards that intention. Think of it, you might relate your other experiences to this phenomenon..

Intention -- that's the most important tool you have if you really want to quit any addiction..

One can 'Roll' a story for you about how he quit smoking.. But, that intention? ..that you guys have to 'Roll' yourselves!!! 
..and that nobody or no story can do it for you..

So guys, close your eyes right now, and ask yourselves if u really wanna quit smoking??

If yes, then just Intend.. ..and then cement that intention to your subconscious, and then, there is no then.

If no, then you are not convinced yet, work on that first!!
:-)

Back in March(ish) I started taking DPH and acetaminophen PM [Which I’m gonna abbreviate as APM] to help me sleep. It helped me sleep thru the day, and ultimately helped me refrain from eating. It was glorious in March, but now I’m fatter, sadder, more tired, and I’ve got some headaches. 

It eventually escalated and I’d take pills every night. I dropped out of my 10am class, and stopped attending my online lectures. Albeit, the fact they were online. My 10am had required attendance, but I couldn’t find it in me to get up and attend. My other lectures were 12:45pm and 2pm so I was fine, until I just stopped attending and listened to recordings. I go back to school in a week and have a couple 9am and 10am courses and am terrified I won’t be able to do it. 

Anyways, it got worse because I went back to work and continued taking pills so I would wake up about 10 minutes before I’d have to leave for work. It hasn’t gotten in the way yet, but I know it will. I ended up at work one day and I wasn’t *high*, but I hadn’t come down completely from my “high”. So I barely remember accurately conversing with coworkers or customers, until a few hours into my shift when I finally chilled out. 

It went from a couple DPH pills to knock me out, to handfulls. I stopped Christmas Eve because I ran out and didn’t want to go buy more. But the last time (Christmas Eve) I took about 18 APM pills, and that was only because I ran out of DPH about a week prior. I was taking 20DPH pills and between 10-20 APM pills, and then some. For a while it was NyQuil because I’ve had a cough for a while which I deemed as a cold. Cold medicine helped, but it’s probably not helping that I’m bulimic too. 

So yeah. It’s been one whole night and I already have a headache. I tried stopping a while ago, and after 24 hours I had a headache. I stopped for ~4 days in September because I went camping, but even then I went and bought DPH containing pain meds. It’s not even like a *BAD* headache. But it’s really dull, and keeps hitting every few hours. I’ll be fine and then suddenly I can’t move my eyes without it hurting. But I’ve had worse pain. I have period cramps worse than these headaches. But they’re bad enough that it makes me want to over do it with my OTC pills knowing it’ll knock me out for a good 18 hours. 

I’m battling something else but I can’t figure out what. I mean, at first it was because I lost weight from not eating. But then I kept gaining weight and it’s like, if it stopped working why did I keep doing it? Like, bulimia doesn’t help anymore. I’m almost as heavy as I was when I started. So why haven’t I stopped ? 

I need help with these headaches, please. I want to have some happiness. I want to just feel *normal* once again. Whatever that may be like",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9962432384490967}"

I was told two things as a kid, by those whom I am sure meant well: (a) that because of my father's alcoholism, I had a very high risk of becoming an alcoholic myself; and (b) that anything at all pleasurable (particularly sex, but also could be really anything that wasn't work, school or exercise) was a danger zone for developing an addiction.

As an adult I am absolutely terrified of developing multiple addictions. I am starting treatment for sex addiction right after the new year, largely because my puritanical upbringing made me feel guilty about having any sexual desire at all (objectively, I know my activity is on the very low side of normal for a healthy adult). Typically, I have enjoyed a glass of wine or two (but can go weeks/months without drinking at all), but yesterday had a panic attack when trying to enjoy a glass with my family on the holiday because I was suddenly afraid of developing a drinking problem. I love video games but almost never play them because I am afraid of becoming addicted. If I am reading a book I enjoy I make myself put it down for a few days or even longer because I am afraid of becoming addicted. I am generally afraid to let myself enjoy anything more than a very tiny amount because I am afraid I will start to like it so much I won't be able to stop (even though I have never actually shown any signs of this).

I don't know what to make of any of this? I am constantly on edge and feeling guilty and ashamed and don't even really know why. Pretty much all I do is work, spend time with my family, exercise (trust me, no chance of addiction there, I don't really like to exercise but do it because I like being relatively healthy and fit) and attend to household chores (similarly, I don't love cleaning but do like having a tidy and orderly home).

We didn't do anything with our days and essentially receded from society. Growing up I had built up more good habits/hobbies/etc and have a small, but close, friendship base. Therefore, through this combination, I made it out and have now moved country to start fresh (and for a PhD). This has really helped push me into a new way of living which is great.

However, my brother has no friends, no hobbies, has bad coping mechanisms, many regrets, low confidence, and is massively depressed. He took a dangerous amount of xanax and other such pills and since then his personality has been...different. I don't really know how to put it. It's like he has something to prove to the world but no drive to do so.

I have come back for the christmas holidays and wow...the house does not look good. My mother, bless her, has tried everything and won't give up on her son, but I can tell it's draining her. She has to hide the kitchen knives every night because he once tried to kill himself with one of them. One of her teeth has become crooked from all the teeth grating she's doing out of stress.

My younger sister has been sort of sidelined through all this, during her rebellious phase, which is just adding to the list of problems. I want to scream just thinking how hard this must be for my mother. She's getting older and must be afraid of leaving this world knowing two of her children don't know how to look after themselves. She was stuck in an physically/emotionally abusive marriage for decades, finally got her freedom and now has to deal with this. It's almost funny how life works.

I'm trying to put on a brave face and lead by example, but what none of them know is that I've been depressed for over a decade. I can never tell them. They have enough problems to deal with, and I've become their rock over the past 6 months. I have a therapist, which I'm going to contact again as it's been a few months. Also, I workout quite a lot and intensely, to fight the depression and try to boost my own confidence.

I want to include my brother in the social things I do, but honestly I'm ashamed of them seeing him in this state. I feel selfish for feeling that way, but he has become...strange. It doesn't feel right to include him, but it doesn't feel right to exclude him. He doesn't have a real purpose right now beyond some programming project that he's working on (though I don't have much faith in this tbh) so I feel it would be really good for him to get a part-time job, as he might make some friends this way too. However, he has become very sensitive and prideful so he might take it the wrong way. Given his deep depression and suicidal tendencies, I'm afraid of pushing him off the edge. But I'm also afraid of not pushing him at all, nothing changes, and I go back to work abroad worrying about what my mother is going through. She tells me not to push him, and that if I do he'll cry and take more drugs, so I don't know what to do beyond leading by example.

Please, reddit, I'm begging you, give me some advice. How do I help my brother? I feel so sorry for him and just want his pain to go away. Honestly, I'd give my life just to make things better for them but I just don't know how to proceed. I feel like I'm choking all the time and I go running to feel like I'm getting away from the situation, but it's always there.

I've been  addicted to cocaine for the last 12 months. In September my parents found out and i started speaking to a counsellor. However everyone thinks I've been clean since 14th October when I actually haven't gone more then 8 days without it. When it gets to that 8th day I am literally fucked. 
I'm a manager for a large food retailer in the UK and when covid hit, we closed down for 3 months and  I had to move to my sisters to protect my parents who were shielding. I don't get on with my sister at all so it was a coping mechanism. Then I moved back to my parents and thought I'd be fine. When I had a bad day I turned to coke. When I was sad, coke, happy coke. Literally a vicious circle. 
My counsellor is aware that I have relapsed 3 times however only a work colleague knows I've relapsed more. 
I stopped taking coke most days and replaced it with red wine. Every day I have a bottle of red wine. Yes its cheaper but not the road I want to go down. 
My parents paid off my debt which accumulated to nearly 6k. Even after that I am still now 1.4k owed to creditors. I changed my bank and my phone number so that I could have a fresh start with everything. But I find myself today, 7am on boxing day, 8 bags in.
I just need a little guidance of what I need to do or can do to stop myself from ending up dead before I am 30.
My country is currently on full lockdown however I am still working. Any sort of articles or activities or anything that can help me. I'd appreciate it.

But I seriously need some feedback or words of advice. Mentally speaking, I'm not in a good place right now.

I'm a male, 26 years old. My girlfriend is a year younger than me. We've known each other now for about a whole year. I have serious feelings for this girl. This is the first girl I've had feelings for in a very, very long time. I don't develop feelings like that easily. And she's clearly stated that she has feelings for me as well. Me and her have non stop been together. I know it's only been a year, but me and her have developed such a connection that I feel like I've known her for a really long time. I care about her deeply.

So I've been clean from drugs and alcohol for about 2 years now. I used to have a really bad addiction, but somehow, like a miracle, I overcame it, and haven't touched any substance since. I never went to rehab, attended therapy, NA meetings, or anything. Somehow I just did it with my own willpower. I'm not saying that makes me better than anyone else or anything like that. I'm just saying that's how I dealt with the situation. Maybe I should've or still should seek out some kind of support system...but I don't know. I'm unsure on how to approach my sobriety honestly. Sometimes I just have to go into denial and pretend like it all never happened, and that I'm perfectly okay now. I know that may sound like an unhealthy coping mechanism. But I try not to focus on the past (my addiction). Dwelling on it doesn't seem like that would be helpful. And yeah, I get urges from time to time, but somehow I never seem to give into them. The urges always pass eventually.

But anyways, so I met this girl back in late 2019. I met her when I was clean. She's never witnessed me using drugs or drinking. But I knew right from the start that she used drugs. But what can I say...it felt like love at first sight. I know to any rational person, and especially anyone who's in recovery, that may sound like an insane relationship to form; for a completely sober person to develop feelings for an addict. But yeah, it is what it is. I was surprised myself. But aside from drug use, this girl does have a good heart and a great personality. I felt like I could see beyond her addiction. One of the main focus points of our relationship is that I always encouraged her to get clean and sober. Now of course that didn't happen overnight. She had a lot of dark moments. She even overdosed a bunch of times. So throughout this whole ordeal of her drug use, I've been by her side, encouraging her to better herself and recognize her self worth. And aside from that there's also been a lot of romance. But just to be clear, I never once bought her drugs or provided her with any money for them. I've never once supported her drug use or tried to make her feel like using was okay. But then again, when you have feelings for someone who's an addict, relentlessly and constantly telling them that they need to get clean would become tiring and annoying. So at times I just wouldn't say anything and would accept the situation for what it is, but in the back of my mind, I would always have that hope that I could persuade her to make the right decision. Now I know all too well that an addict can only get help for themselves. They can't do it for anyone else. But I figured that me supporting her recovery and reminding her that there's still hope in life couldn't hurt.

I don't wanna flood you (the reader) with endless details, as I'm sure I already have. But this girl has been through a lot. She's been abused, physically, sexually, and probably mentally. She's experienced a lot of loss, and overall, has had a lot of bad things happen to her. And knowing these things made me go out of my way to be extra respectful to her. Now I clearly am not trying to be overly nice or fake. We've had our arguments here and there. But knowing what she's been through, I wanted to show her that love is still possible and that not everyone in this world is bad. I really do care about her and want her to be happy.

So back in late November, she actually went to rehab. Not sure if I had anything to do with that...but she went. And I was so proud of her for that. I'm still proud of her. While she was in rehab, I wrote her letters of love and support frequently. She requested that I bring her cigarettes many times, cause I guess the rehab she was in didn't have her particular favorite brand. And I brought her other things as well. I basically did whatever she wanted. I just wanted her to be as comfortable as possible in rehab. And honestly, I missed her and still miss her like crazy. She rarely got to talk on the phone when she was in rehab. And I'm not gonna lie, the phone conversations were a bit awkward. She was only allowed to talk for five minutes and our conversations were being monitored. So that was a bit weird.

But just recently she got transferred to a sober house. I'm not gonna pretend to know the ins and outs of rehabs and sober houses. But the main difference at this place is that she's able to call me and have long conversations. So last night was the first time I was able to talk to her without time limits or being monitored. Here I was, all overwhelmingly excited to finally hear from her again...but things didn't go like I thought they would. She didn't seem happy to hear from me. When I talked about seeing her again, there was hesitation in her voice. I just didn't feel that loving or friendly energy at all. I almost felt like she doesn't like me anymore. And that seriously hurt. After all this time and everything her and I have been through, I just don't get it. Why would she dislike me?? I've never used her, abused her, or anything like that. I'm so confused, and like I said...hurt. I'm constantly wondering what I did wrong and why she wouldn't like me anymore. This has really messed with my head.

Now, to put myself in her shoes, I understand that she's probably going through a lot right now. Going without drugs has to be a major transition for sure. So I'm trying to be as understanding and as patient as possible. But I just don't understand, why me, out of all people, she wouldn't like anymore. It just makes no sense. If I was an enabler or someone who she did drugs with, than I'd get that. But all I've ever given her was love, friendship, and support. So this really confuses me. I'm hurting right now because of this. It's not easy for me to love someone. So yeah, this does feel like betrayal or abandonment to a certain extent. I fell hard for this girl. But I'm gonna try to maintain patience.

Ironically though, last night, after our conversation, I felt so confused and hurt, that I actually heavily pondered using again. On Christmas out of all times. So this is not a good time for me.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8940341472625732}"

This was really strange and happened within around two weeks. I saw her two weeks before and her teeth were normal.

Has anyone got any idea why this might happen? She smokes but only like 4-5 a day and drinks tea, which is what she’s been blaming the teeth thing on. Me and our other friends are getting quite concerned, she’s barely able to concentrate on a conversation.

She also drinks pretty heavily and smokes a lot of weed. She slapped one of our friends (lightly but it was weird) for literally no reason, and attacked her sister when her sister challenged her about her drinking. We have another friend (also 21F) who’s very druggy, who I had to cut contact with, and my best friend is being very pushy about us making up etc, which makes me feel uncomfortable. 

This behaviour is very unusual for her, she has a history of anxiety, but is otherwise a very highly functioning, happy gal.

Me and our other friends have tried to talk to her but she just talks about how great she’s doing and how happy she is etc, which may be a front. Not sure tbh. 

She’s been treating me badly these last few months (begging me to break social distancing and go to house parties when my parents are vulnerable, being late all the time, lying about me to other friends which I only found out this evening). I’m going to distance myself from her but just want to make sure I do the right thing for her well-being so she gets help, while maintaining my boundaries.

In a year he'll be an adult and my parents won't be able to order him around anymore in order to help him and will have no choice but to kick him out.

Both of us had a crappy childhood. Abusive mom and enabler dad. I internalised my feelings while my brother externalised them. I harmed myself while he harmed others mostly.

&#x200B;

* Violence. Since he turned 14 he just grew more extreme. He fought with my parents, he became scarier, louder. He started breaking things and then assaulting my parents. My parents fell just short of pushing charges, so the police definitely know about him but he appeared to have no emotion when he was arrested. We went to a family therapist for some 20 sessions. Things got a little better only because all of us had to change ourselves around my brother's impossible and narcissistic needs. We discontinued the family therapist because he was always making an emphasis on us to change and never told my brother to change.
* Smoking. My brother's been addicted to cigarettes for 2 years and he admits that he's addicted. My parents always throw out the cigarettes and lighters whenever they find them, and my brother continues to buy new packets and new lighters every time. It's a real waste of money. He only gets to smoke like 5 cigarettes before the packet and the lighter get thrown away.
* Drinking.  He started underage drinking at the age of 14 (drinking age here is 17). At 16 he drank the entire alcohol cabinet secretly at night over a period of 2 weeks. This includes cooking wine and a Jagermeister with 35% alcohol that was too strong for my parents. He said he did it because he was stressed, lonely, and wanted to feel 'mellow'. The incident caused my parents to not buy any alcohol, and anything for cooking they have to hide it in their bathroom. He turned 17 so he's of legal drinking age now, so he regularly drinks with his friends. A lot of the times they're hard alcohols but he's never gotten home drunk (or at least not that we've realised).
* Weed. He's been smoking weed for more than a year. Since he started I noted a further change in his personality, for the worse. Because that was around the time his violence became more extreme. He also appeared stoned on days after out with his friends the day before.
* Trying other substances? One time we found a bottle of very strong painkillers in his room (it was from our medicine cabinet and with a prescription). He wouldn't tell us what it was doing in his room. Was he trying to get high on them? His sleep schedule has been fucked for a long time. Whenever he doesn't have school he stays awake watching something until 11 or 1 in the morning and then always wakes up at 11 in the morning. It's caused him to be late and miss a lot of events. But recently he went to a new extreme by staying up all night, studying or watching something or pacing. My parents suspect he's taking some sort of study drug to keep him awake because he's lied three times now that he's been going out with friends when he appeared to be going out alone.

&#x200B;

He fits what I've read about an addictive personality. He exaggerates in everything, admits to seeking substances to make himself feel better instead of doing normal things like seeking new hobbies or something. And addiction seems to run in the family as our great uncle was bipolar and did drugs for a time. He's also extremely impuslive to the point of a 2 year old.

He also might have ADHD as a lot of the symptoms fit him and I myself am diagnosed with autism spectrum. And I read people with ADHD are more likely to seek substances to calm their anxiety.

I talked to my mum later on, who is more chill about it and she told me my grandma knew that a guy who came in the afternoon gave weed.

Or should I be worrying?","I'm a 22 year old male, who is in a stable job, has a stable career trajectory, and has been living alone for the first time in my life for about 6 months. I've been using drugs since I was 14, but was never a daily user of anything but caffeine and melatonin for most of my life. This has changed since I started living alone. 

I got a job in high school freelance writing for a vitamins and supplements startup company, and that introduced me to the world of weird grey area drugs and nootropics. I've kept a supplement stack with me for about five years now and take probably four of five supplements every morning. Outside of being expensive, I'm not positive if this is harmful. 

Also in high school did I start abusing (stealing...) prescription drugs. Grandparents would just sort of leave them out, and I got pretty used to using opioids twice a week and using benzos twice a week, and using DXM maybe twice a week, and... probably using gabapentin or something on the off day. Eventually, family found out, and I was cut off, and I don't think I had any crazy withdrawals. 

But I started right up again at the age of probably 17, still using DXM and having discovered poppy seed tea. Eventually, once I started my undergrad, I got into a relationship with a girl who I very badly did not want to disappoint, and so I stopped using everything except the supplements and the caffeine for a couple years. Moved in with the girl. When I was 21 I started using cannabis nightly for sleep, and nicotine (via gum) daily for the... I don't know what for. Hid them from my girlfriend because I knew she would not approve. Graduated from my undergrad Magna Cum Laude. 

Her and I ended up breaking up around my 22nd birthday since she got a job as a nurse and I got into a graduate school in a different part of the country. It was an amicable breakup, and it was my idea, and I kinda sorta regret it a lot. Her and I still text, and I watch her Twitch stream, and I'm ashamed to say that texting and talking to her is probably my biggest and worst addiction... I am not a very strong person. I've met new girls through my job, a couple of which have asked me out, and I ended up rejecting them out of fear of ruining the friendship I have with my ex-girlfriend. I don't know what the protocol is for that sort of thing, especially during COVID.

Anyways, to fill the weird loneliness void from that situation and from living in a new city during quarantine, I've kinda started using drugs again, almost exactly like I did in high school. Here's a list of the things I do -- 

* Caffeine, 200mg, daily
* Nicotine Patches, 42mg, daily
* Phenibut, 800mg at least, daily
* Kratom, 6-12g, twice a week 
* Big phenibut days, 1.6g, twice a week
* LSA via HBWR, 6-10 seeds, twice a week 
* Alcohol, 1-3 drinks, nightly, with 6 unit nights maybe once a week
* THC via cart, \~15mg, nightly
* DXM, 400mg, maybe once every other week 
* Memantine, 60-100mg, maybe once every other week

and supplements...

* Melatonin, 1mg, nightly
* pregnenolone, 400-800mg sublingual (total megadose), as needed for antidepressant effect
* lithium orotate, 20mg, was using daily but stopped once started using LSA
* NAC, 3g, almost daily
* Agmatine, 3g, almost daily
* CBD via cart, \~30mg, daily

So I guess my question is... am I headed down a path I don't want to head down? The alcohol and phenibut are the only things that I'm really weary of, but regardless, what does this say about my personality? And what does this say about my psychology? Is this something normal for a young adult who's just wildin while living alone for the first time? Do any hard truths stand out to you that I need to face? And has anyone had any similar experiences and can share some insight?",4,"{'covid': 1, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9973917007446289}"

I had some months clean, well on maintenance meds, and got kicked from the clinic for my iv stim habit. So decide to get H. Used the first day, then used 1 extra bag the next day. I used, got up from the bathroom to open the door and then blacked out, my wife saying that I was incoherent and holding myself up on the wall while walking and then did a face plant into the floor. She had to break into the safe to retrieve the narcan because I hid the key to the safe, luckily she got into it, so in a panic she sprayed me once, then again. I woke up feeling disoriented with the worst headache and shakes and tremors and sweats and also my shirt soaking wet from her throwing water on me.

So, on Sat I lapse with stims again, and last night decided to get H. So I walked the streets till I found someone, which was relatively easy. I actually got 2 diff types, And used 1 bag last night. Felt fantastic. Mind you I've been on 2mg of subs since March. Anyways, I wake up today, head to the bathroom, decide to try the other kind, and use 2. I remember finishing and unlocking the door and then waking up soaking wet and all the same feelings as previously described. This was at 1030 am.

I'm now at work, my head hurts but energy is fine, I just feel so shameful and guilty. Most of it because I lied to my wife and put her through another traumatic experience. She has helped me and supported me so much and I just wish I was never an addict. Fuck, I'm just asking myself when will it be enough. This is my 5th time being narcaned and I had one OD from a suicide attempt which hospitalized me for 2 weeks. I'm so sick of this. All the paraphernalia is gone fortunately and the junk.

First of all, thanks for even considering reading this post! Really appreciate it :)

I'm a 21 Y/O male which got diagnosed with ADD recently. I've been put on 15mg methylphenidate prescription to help me function in my day to day life, my life is getting in a somewhat order now and I finally can get my mind together to do certain things and see positive in the future. I still find it really hard to find and build a routine but I'm finally getting help with that next year :)

Now since the age of 14 I have been struggling with pornography which has really bad effects on my mental well being. In the beginning, I thought I would just quit porn when I was like 20/21 due to it just magically fading away and losing interest in it, my mom told me this when I was about 16 Y/O. Boy was she wrong..

Now I'm 21 and it's just getting harder and harder to stop. Back when I was 17/19 I could sometimes stop for like 3/4 months and just let it go. But as of now, I can't even stop watching porn for half a day. I sometimes am able to quit for 2/3 days and this makes me feel so much better, my anxiety slowly fades away, I become way more social and my self-image improves tremendously.

Now I know there is a correlation between porn and ADD/ADHD brains due to the fact there is less dopamine ready in our brains and therefore we seek ways of achieving dopamine in an instant and most likely choosing ways that aren't healthy for us. For me this is porn.

If anyone got any tips, please let me know! I just don't have any control over this addiction and it's burning me up from inside out, even if it's a small little tip I would love to hear it!

Also, let me know if you are struggling with this as well?

Thanks for making it this far! And have a wonderful Christmas! :D

I just wanted to throw out a couple behaviors.  Does anyone have an idea what he’s doing?

-he is almost 50, but sleeps till about 1 or 2pm every day by default.  During regular work days, he’ll struggle through normal business hours when he has to on vespers of sleep, then go back to his sleep schedule.
-he is about 6’ tall and weighs 130lbs.
-his sleep endgame is always to be out of sync with his family and everyone else’s lives.  He wants that time in front of the computer and to be left alone.  Always with his computer.
-he chews gum starting around 10pm.  Often but not always.  Could it be a substance?
-he doesn’t drink and doesn’t smoke
-his body is falling apart.  From acid to gout to shingles to upset stomach.  Acid is eating away his esophagus.  Teeth are grinding down.  A lot about his body has aged faster than it should have.
-he is very moody about sleep
-my dad just went through chemo for a brain tumor.  When my brother was taking care of him, my dad had to wake him up to get a ride to radiation.  
-he used to stay up till the sun came up playing video games.  Since his daughter was born, that’s changed a bit, but not that much.

Hello guys.

some time ago, I told a piece of my story.

[HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/k19w54/help_with_cocaine_addiction/)

I've been addicted to cocaine for 8 years and for the past 3 years, I've been a heavy cocaine user.

got it in the last few days. stay clean for 18 days. that was my record for the past few years. I am very proud of myself.

today  unfortunately I had a relapse until planned - I'm not depressed but I'm  not euphoric either. at the moment i just threw the last doses in the  flush and i was very happy.

I promised myself before that that 2021 I will be cleared of cocaine and my motivation and strength are very sharp.

I believe the day has come people. enough is enough.

my  limit of tranquility is 14 days. above that I already have difficulty  even with the medicines that the doctors prescribed for me and to  overcome this I just have to try to talk to those who want my good.

tomorrow  will be the day that i will do the christmas barbecue for the family  and then i cannot be high for those i love so much!

I  would like to thank you for helping me so much - and that I will never  abandon you. because helping other addicts - I help myself too. drugs is  a burden that we will carry until the last day of our lives because  there is no ex-addict.

I'm  from Brazil. and I hope that in the year 2021 we can all be better in  life and make the world a better place with small attitudes.

Technically I got paid but it looks like the Fed Reserve possibly isn't open today and that's why my funds are posted? Idk, I don't want to look it up - I'm hoping that the fed is closed until Monday so I don't lose all want to be good. I could easily get hooked up with coke and ketamine, apparently, and I'm 31 so getting alcohol is literally nothing.

I want to be good/make the right decisions to not have to deal with the cravings after giving in to them. But if I don't have someone to hold me accountable - if I feel like the day doesn't matter and who cares what I do - then what will I do?

I've already started drinking at work which I've been on and off controlling but I really should up my game when it comes to that.

I may be the top salesperson at my place of business (15 leases in 2 weeks - woot!!) but every Saturday rolls around and I just don't have enough to do to keep my interest and convince me that I shouldn't drink. I didn't last week but I did leave an hour early because I just couldn't anymore. I am paid hourly. I am expected to stay for the entirety of my scheduled hours - I cannot make my own schedule.

Yet I've left early every Saturday for at least the past month.

I take advantage of people's trust too often.

I get the work done, I even go above and beyond at every chance I get because I looooove being told that I'm doing the best.

So why don't I feel the same high at being 'the best' at sobriety?

I am going to try to change this mindset.

I already don't drink at home even though my roommate will not judge me because I am funnier when I'm sober. And I Love being funny - making her laugh. Bringing a smile to that dumb stupid beautiful face of hers. It's such a good face. (If she heard me say this, all she would say would be 'gaaaaaay' or r/SuddenlyGay and I love that too)

&#x200B;

I want to be good so she won't have to worry every time she leaves. My sobriety is not on her. It's my convictions that need work. My self discipline.

It's no one's responsibility but my own to stay sober. Especially when it matters.

&#x200B;

BTW - DAE have therapists/psychs that encourage drinking as a way to reframe their mindset around the substance?

Mine keep bringing it up when I talk about the guilt I get when I delve into the substance. I think they get set on how I don't binge - I've always been the type of person to drink to a point and then stay at that point. Just slightly buzzed. But 2 years ago when I got sober at the height of my alcoholism, I was drinking a handle of whiskey and a 30pk of beer every 2 days to maintain that buzz. I guess I don't and will never drink 24/7 again but my ability to know when drinking is inappropriate is just out the window. I know I can get away with being plastered so having a drink or 2 at work on a dead af Saturday isn't a big deal to me in the moment.

I've never been caught but I feel like that there is always a chance for everything (though my boss will be so gone this Saturday that I'm going to bring her dogs to hang out with me to take care of them all day whilst I'm on the clock - the other supervisor lives over an hour away so def won't be in on a Sat - so I already feel like I can get away with anything on that day.

Some real snake in the grass type shit no one seems happy for me. Don’t know if I’m just being a whiny bitch boy about it but I feel like no ones acknowledging it purely because I don’t scribe my troubles all over social media which is why I came here to a Reddit full of complete strangers.

My husband has a history of meth use, he smokes it and maybe snorts it? 

So back in September I found out he had been using since June of this year. I always knew he was, but he would deny it. He was all of a sudden very angry and mean all of the time. He started working nights and that’s how he was doing it, he would smoke on the way to work I guess and I didn’t think any of it, because he would come home the next day and sleep for a couple of hours and go back.. he’s very good at hiding it, and sleeps still.. 

So the two comes in here, I found out my husband liked anal at this time, which was all good and ok with me, I had pegged a previous boyfriend and loved it. But see, the only time he has ever been open about this, was when he was using. I didn’t know at the time, but lately.. he has been very mean and aggressive again. Stays awake all fucking night, “can’t sleep” yeah okay we have a newborn and he works, explain that. Eyes are bloodshot sometimes, and last night was just all of a sudden okay with me rimming him and fingering him and then said I could peg him for the first time. Don’t get me wrong yall, there’s nothing wrong with this, but it’s a red flag when he has been acting weird and all of a sudden something he gets upset over when I ask if I can do when I KNOW he’s sober is all of a sudden extremely welcomed when he’s been acting weird? 

I love this man with all of my heart, but I am leaving soon with my children. I know he has demons he is fighting but I can’t let us be his whipping post anymore and potentially hurt us, or me again. 

I am posting here I guess because I figure actively using addicts and ex addicts might tell me what they think..

How can I help him?,"One of my oldest friends has become addicted to drugs (mainly cocaine and oxy) and now is asking me for help. We met about 10 years ago in college, where we both got useless artsy degrees, and became very close friends. When we graduated, he moved to NYC, started working in food service, and I went to grad school. Eventually, I moved to NYC as well (1 year ago), and he helped me get a job in a cafe. 

As soon as I got to NYC, I knew something was off with my friend. All of his new friends were huge partiers, getting drunk every night, and generally pretty shallow. They would do coke and K and get 3 hours of sleep before taking adderall to get through a morning shift at their job. I've tried drugs before and used to party in college, but this would have seemed excessive even when I was 21.

Over time, I started to notice worrying behaviors in my friend. He would ask the same question multiple times in the same night. For example, he would ask ""How is [insert old college friend] doing?"" even though I had already talked to him for 5 minutes about that friend 30 minutes prior. I mentioned to his new friends that it was super worrying that he couldn't remember anything and they were just like ""Oh, it's just the alcohol, that happens."" 

Right before Covid hit, my friend started buying large quantities of uncut drugs to deal to his friends. This is when things started to get really bad. Although he is selling, he would always try everything before selling it and was doing drugs all the time. And over time, he has seemed more and more unstable.

He has told me that he has gone through withdrawals 2-3 times, felt like he was dying, and didn't get out of bed for days. He's said that he will take so much cocaine that he can't fall asleep, so he'll take xanax or something (I can't remember) to fall asleep. And it is becoming more and more obvious in his actions. He sent me texts at 4AM about how he has had a spiritual breakthrough and then immediately sending texts apologizing for bothering me. 

Today he called me at 10AM and was having difficulty talking. He kept mispronouncing common words or would repeat the word over and over trying to get it right but just couldn't. He would start sentences and just never finish them. I was trying to give him my phone number for something and he had me repeat it maybe 10-15 times and when he would read it back the numbers would be all out of order. 

During the phone call, he said that he wanted to pay one of his friends, me in particular, to give him therapy. I tried to encourage him to go to a regular therapist and he refused. He said that they would judge and wouldn't empathize with him. He said that it would be just like what happened with his brother who went to 3-4 therapists, never finding the right one. His brother later committed suicide. 

I want to help this friend but I don't know how. I'm willing to talk to him every week but I'm obviously NOT qualified to be his therapist. I don't really know his family to reach out to them and they are also quite conservative so I don't know if it would even be helpful. His other friends are, according to him, being very ""tough love"" right now after recognizing the problem. My friend is also pretty unwilling to give up his ""business"" since selling to his friends has become his primary source of income due to Covid. So Reddit, what do I do?

I mean I lost everyone in my life because of my use but it doesn't mean it sucks any less. 

I lost my wife,son,family,and even though I just want to use I know it won't be fun. I'll just be drunk n high and sad. It's important to remember that. Its not fun anymore. Its always a chore when I use. 

Reaching out for help doesn't work for me. I been in the mental ward 5 times this year with no help from the VA. Their strategy is just stick you in a holding ward so they don't get blamed for your suicide. 

For the record I'm not suicidal. I'm just low. Plus everytime I open up about my issues the docs never do anything with it. They just document it and maybe throw meds at me.

I started my freshman year of college, just smoking with friends. Then I got depressed and moved back home, found a dealer. Found a friend who turned out to be a sociopath. We smoked together every day. I had a good side job and spent all of my extra money on weed. It did nothing for my depression or anxiety.

I went back to school and skipped class to smoke and just feel depressed. I had to go back home again. I started working again and smoked weed with my coworkers at work. Then one night I was sitting in my car in a parking lot and got arrested for a DUI...they smelled weed on me. I still smoked every day until my letter with the court date came 9 months later. I had to jump through hoops, but got my record expunged. I stopped smoking while I was in the program. My depression and anxiety seemed ok.

I went back to school again and started drinking since I couldn't smoke anymore. The day I got word that my record was expunged, I started smoking again. I just wanted to be an occasional user, but once I get an eighth I smoke it in less than 24 hours. All of my savings, all of my hard work, all of my parents' financial support spent on weed. 

This year I had a traumatic breakup. I started buying weed multiple times a week, smoking 10+ joints every day. I spent all of my rent/food money on weed. Told my mom I spent the money on house plants and food. We are now carefully controlling how much money I get so I stop spending. But I still have a side job, and immediately spend it on weed. I think, I will let this last me a week. And 12-24 hours later, I smoked it all. Then I feel like shit because I ran out. When I don't have access, I will steal from friends and family. I started talking to people online considering selling pictures/videos of myself so I can afford my habit, but I really don't want to do this. 

So now when I can't smoke, I get drunk. Almost every night. Now I feel like an alcoholic. It runs in my family. I'm scared and I think I need help. I have severe depression, and I know weed will just make it worse for me. It ruins my motivation. But it makes me feel less miserable, like I can bear to exist for a bit. Recently I didn't have any money left in my account, so I couldn't even buy a single beer. I've been feeling so depressed. My doctors are taking care of me and sent me an online rehab program, but I think I'm still in denial about how much drugs are affecting my life. Even writing this, I think I don't need help, I can probably do it by myself, but it's also not worth being sober when I feel so depressed.

Although my depression and anxiety started before I ever started smoking/drinking, I feel like it's my fault that I still feel this bad. If I was sober maybe I could think more clearly and support myself. But this week I stopped smoking and couldn't stop crying/having suicidal thoughts. I started to get drunk to numb the pain. Just counting down the hours for it to be later in the day so I can justify drinking. 

I'm talking to my doctor today and he will probably change my medications again. I'm so sick of everything. And fuck my ex for being a piece of shit and traumatizing and manipulating me.

Ready for a story? This’ll be a long one! Lmao! 

Ok so I (39m) and my ex (26f) have this weird relationship thing going on right now and I was looking for opinions/suggestions/input. I know I probably won’t like most— if not all— of them. lmao. Ok so here it goes. But you’ll need to know the back story. You’ll need to know where we started and all the trials and tribulations that went into whatever it is we have— at least a shortened version of some of them at least. 

First tho, I should give a trigger warning as we’re both in recovery right now and there will be talk of past drug/alcohol use. I’m addict/alcoholic and she’s an addict. There’s also going to be talk of cutting, suicide, and eating disorders. And I’m sure there’s more triggers in here as well. Soooo back to story time. 

We met back in February of this year (2020) maybe around 5pm or so— idk w/e. We hit it off pretty great as friends and there was definitely a spark there. I met her over my buddy’s house, and gave her my number in case she wanted to talk more some day— literally 5 minutes after I left she was blowing me up. We talked all that day/night up until she got a call abt her aunt in the hospital dying around 4am. She of course immediately went to the hospital to meet with her mother and spend what little time she had left with her aunt. The next morning she borrowed her mother’s car and left the hospital to get fresh clothes for her and her mother and got pulled over. Now this is the part where I tell you she had a warrant and got arrested for a probation violation (OD’d) and was immediately jailed. Our story would’ve ended there because at that point we had only known each other for about 12-15 hrs and she didn’t know my number by heart. We barely knew each other. 

But it didn’t end there. Oh no. Not at all. lol. That next day I was over some friends house. I, of course, was talking all abt this amazing woman I had met the day before and how I just felt something different— yet something just familiar. It was a feeling I haven’t felt before. And I have known love before. My fiancée and I had broken up abt 8months prior after being together for almost 14 yrs (story for another time), but w/ this woman it was just different. Idk. Anyway, I was just gassing her up to my friends and we hear a knock on the door. My friend goes to answer the door and it’s the police. Apparently she had a warrant out for her arrest. So my friend, of course, gets arrested. Now unbeknownst to me (or my friends) at the time the girl I had met the day before had been incarcerated. I figured she was just busy with the dying aunt. 

So my friend calls me later that night after processing to talk to her boyfriend and try to figure out arrangements to bail her out. And right before I pass the phone off to him my friend asks me the name of the girl I had been talking abt. Well, I’m sure you can guess the rest. As fate would have it, it was indeed the same girl. So my friend was able to give this girl my number and she called. And we talked. And we talked. And we talked and talked and talked. And we wrote letters to each other back and forth daily. And when I say wrote letters I mean that. Our letters would be a minimal of 10 pages front and back— my longest was around 23 pages front and back. (She loved them piss yellow legal pad pages I wrote to her lol). We got to know each other rather well, and after about a month she asked me if I would commit to her— if I would be her boyfriend. Well, it was a little more cute than that, but that’s neither here nor there. So there I was dating a con. A love story for the ages. lmao. Anyway, things continued pretty well. She ended up being locked up for about a month and a half and was released early due to coronavirus. She was out for 4-5 days before she checked into 30 day stay. And we spent just abt every waking hour together. She was sober, I sadly was not, and we were happy. She checked into inpatient and I’m pretty sure that’s when the cracks started. Nothing major, but our communication was severely cut. Phone calls were more limited in rehab, but we still talked almost daily. Since she was only allowed one call per day she had to divide that between her mother and i, but we still wrote daily for the first couple weeks until her counselors started giving her shit abt not putting as much effort into the program that they would’ve liked to have seen. They advised her to start journaling and writing me less— even though our letters were pretty therapeutic for her. Anyway, our communication decreased— instead of being on the phone for hours a day we went down to 5 minutes most days as that was the max clients were allowed to use the phone. Instead of murdering trees by the hundreds we wrote a few pages here and there. On a side note, I wondered for a time if her counselors had not limited our communication if things would’ve been different?

Anyway, 30 days came and went. Her mom and I had formed a pretty decent relationship during that time. Her mother was pretty skeptical of me at the beginning— since, well, this girl hadn’t the best track record in her previous relationships— on top of the fact her mother thought the worst of me drug wise. Yea, I am an addict/alcoholic now in recovery—and so is she— but our DoCs were different. I’m not saying mine were worse or better either. An addict is an addict is an addict. So her mom naturally thought my DoC was the same as her daughters. She was relieved to find out it wasn’t and thats I think where the trust started forming. 

So 30 days later we were finally reunited again. And it was great. She had jail/rehab behind her and we were moving forward. We had plans and we were happy. And that lasted for about a solid 2 months. I could feel it. I rly could. I felt her slipping away and isolating. I starting noticing the deception and lies forming. I knew something wasn’t right. She was testing me. Prodding me into a corner to try and make arguments, and I tried my damndest not to fall for it. This culminated until we hit our boiling point. She started disappearing for hours/days. And we finally had our first argument. And then another. And then the truth finally came out. She was hanging out with an acquaintance of mine. A local dealer much closer to her age. She had “feelings” for him— lol not the drugs of course. And I tried to warn her that the path she was choosing would ultimately be her downfall. I pleaded with her that even if we couldn’t be together just please don’t do what she was with who she was. All that hard work and sober time would be lost. Her son she was trying so hard to get custody back of would suffer for it. I spelled out for her what literally ended up being the next two months of her life— and I was right. Everything happened just as I said it would, up to and including losing complete custody of her 18 month old son. We broke up, she relapsed (well, she technically did before we broke up), and things went south for her fast. I should also mention that when we broke up I told her not to contact me anymore. That I needed to clear my head/emotions if we were to continue our friendship. I wanted her to be happy, but I knew I needed space— and she was not very happy about that. She threw it in my face how I told her I would “always” be there for her and I was her best friend. And I told her we needed space. We needed it or we would have nothing. Anyway. 

Now, I’m not a bad guy. And I do love her. And I’m the type that empowers, not controls, so her life was her life to live. But we have mutual friends, so I still checked up on what she was doing. And it wasn’t great. She was going bad. First came the alcohol, then the pills, and the party drugs, and finally— well, I don’t need to go there. I talked to her mother still after her and I broke up every couple weeks. I let her mother know abt this other guy and his business. Told her that I wasn’t giving up, that I just needed space. I still wanted her friendship, but things had been getting toxic and any friendship would be lost if we continued that toxicity. And I warned her mother to please just watch out for her. Please just be cautious. And I let her mom know some of what I was hearing here and there, but I made sure to emphasize that what I heard was just that— hearsay. Rumors. Things that could be or not be true, but I still wanted her to know. 
So during this time my previous ex and I had gotten back together sometime in July and got engaged again. And again, another dark, dark story. But one night my friend told my this girl had started doing what I dreaded she would. And I had to let her mother know. There’s a line, and I can let some slide, but I wouldn’t be responsible for an unnecessary death if I could have spoken up and said something. My previous ex wasn’t too keen on me still caring, but I’m sorry, a life is a life. So I called her mother the next day. I told her that her daughter was in a rly bad place and she needed, needed to get her back into detox/inpatient. Little did I know that she had OD’d the day before (the news I heard was abt a day late). The mother told me that her daughter was checking into rehab that next morning. And I asked her mother to please ask her daughter to call me. And she did. I told her that even tho I was away that I was always caring. I never stopped caring abt her as a friend. I let her know that I wanted the space to salvage our friendship, and if we hadn’t that the toxicity would’ve ruined everything. And she finally saw that. She admitted to me that I had been right all along, but she just needed to learn it on her own. We talked for a good 30minutes before she was admitted, and we patched things up between us. This was now the beginning of August. 

So. My ex was getting the help she needed. I was engaged again to the woman I had been with for almost 14 yrs. And I had my alcoholism just abt under control, or so I thought...

Now this is where I mention without going into much detail that after my 14 year old relationship ended the year before I spiraled. Like big time. Spent thousands and thousands of dollars, suicidal, lost my job, drug/alcohol abuse like crazy, lots of sex with multiple women— many times in the same night. Just like for real I lost it. It was extremely traumatic for me. Hint: I wasn’t at fault for the breakup. Add to the fact 3 months before we broke up my 10 year old cousin committed suicide. It was just rough. 2019 was a horrible year for me. But during that year I started seeing a counselor and getting my life back on track. And tbh, things started getting way better for me mentally after I had met that girl in Feb 2020 and we started dating. Like I swear to god she saved my life. I believed in love again after her. And even tho we hadn’t worked out, the love I have for her is like none other I can explain. Like I rly don’t know how to explain it. It’s just there. Like it had always been there. Like everything that happened in my entire life led me to her. But yeah, she saved me. I would probably be dead by now if it hadn’t been for her. So there’s that tidbit of history. 

So, mid August my ex is in rehab and we’re talking here n there— pretty much just making sure she’s alright n stuff. I’m in a relationship. Engaged. The fiancée and I are trying to patch up our new relationship from what she had done the previous year. Things were looking alright for me. And then it happened. My fiancée left me again— for the same damn married man— AGAIN! And I loooooost it. It was like that whole year process of me getting back somewhat ok again was gone. The anxiety attacks. The hurt. The trauma. All of it. Only this time it was worse. It felt condensed. It felt like a year worth of hurt and anguish and the desire of death flooded back like a damn burst. I spoke to my ex in rehab 2 days after my fiancée left. And she pleaded with me— begged me to be careful. Told me when she got out she was maybe hoping she could move in with me— as a friend, of course. But I was gone. My sanity broke. My soul crushed. I wanted to be nothing— to feel nothing. See, my problem with alcohol is that I use it not to feel. To numb my brain. I literally had been on a bender for a little over 20 years. Sans 6 days in that 20 years I had not drank. That’s it. Less than a week in more than 20 years. And when I’m in a dark spot I would drink until I couldn’t feel. And then I’d drink more until I couldn’t move. And then I’d pass out and drink again the next day. I’m what they call a functioning alcohol. And I was for 20+ years until I wasn’t. That night I talked to my ex in rehab I told her I’d be ok— that I’d try to be safe. And I was for the most part. I was over a friends and then left for the bar. And then I got arrested after I left the bar around 10:30. I was somewhere in the 4-5x the legal limit, yet I was still sober in my mind. I literally still had hours left in me and another 20beers waiting for me that I left at my friends house. The bar was just going to be a quick in/out. Only had like 4 beers n a couple shots. But I had lost it. I ended up being arrested and thrown into the mental ward and put under suicide watch. The officer saw the cuts up and down my arms that I did a couple days earlier. Yes, I’m a cutter. I hadn’t done it in many years, but I was a wreck and I felt it was better to cut the pain away then to end the pain. But I’m not going to lie— I wanted to die. I was working myself up to killing myself. One last hurrah as it were. Because in my mind I had nothing left to lose. And I didn’t care. I wasn’t about to go where I had been again and deal with another year of that pain and suffering. I was over it. That night I ended up going exactly where I needed to. There was no wreck. No speeding. The cop watched me pull out of the bar and took a chance and got me. I’m not angry abt it. Everything in life happens just as it needs to. I firmly believe that. And this was my time. I spent the next 5days under suicide watch in the mental ward, and then was transferred to a 30 day inpatient treatment facility. I was able to call my ex’s mother (the one in rehab) to let her know what was going on so my ex wouldn’t get worried. I did talk to my ex in rehab the night after I got arrested. I wasn’t moved right up to the mental ward because I needed a COVID test first, so luckily I was able to speak to her once. 

Ok, so if you’re still bearing with me I am getting close to the end of the backstory. Thank god, right?! Lmao. 

Ok, so I got outta the psych ward and then made it to rehab. Called my ex’s mom. Told her how I could be contacted. The rehab I was in was great. And it was very low intensity. 3.1 compared to my ex that was in a 3.5 if anyone knows the difference. So I had access to my cellphone and everything where I was. Ok so my ex went in beginning of Aug and I went in mid Aug., so basically I was going to be in around 20 days longer than her. 

Well, while she was in rehab and I was dating my ex on the outside, my ex in rehab met some guy. A good ol fashion rehab romance. (Sweet right?! This story has it all! lol) And when my ex got out this dude AMA’d with her. Started living at her mom’s while I was in rehab. Now my ex assured me that this guy was only staying with her for a very short time as he needed a more intense 90 day program and was leaving for that shortly. Whatever. She told me she was “enjoying the company” until then and it wasn’t anything serious. Ok. Whatever. Not like I could  talk or do much, or for that matter in any kinda mental space to even want anything other than working out my own demons. I needed to do me and get my head right again. So my ex and I talked a bit while I was in rehab. She sent me some nudes/videos for some reason I still can’t figure out. But whatever. Anyway, while I was in rehab she and new dude started using. Betcha didn’t see that coming?! She graduated from bumping to shooting— new dude’s preference. And then she OD’d again. I called her PO (while I’m in inpatient) and told her what happened and talked to her PO for quite awhile. I pleaded with her PO not to throw her in jail, but to get her back into rehab at a new place since the one she had gone to (twice now) was garbage. Her PO saw how much I cared and knew I wasn’t bullshitting her and so she was lenient on my ex and made her start an IOP program instead. And when I got outta inpatient I started the same IOP. Btw, not that it matters but I wasn’t court sanctioned into anything. I went to inpatient/IOP on my own. I needed a fresh start in life and something different. Ok, so I think we’re in the end of September now. I’m outta inpatient, she’s outta inpatient, we’re both in IOP, and dumbass dude is still living with her at her mother’s. Everyone for the most part is doing what they need to do— except dumbass dude. Ugh. He never ended up going for that extended treatment he was so intent on going to. Surprise, surprise. lol

Wellllll, as one might suspect she gets knocked up after abt a month and a half of knowing/being with this guy. Yay!!! Right? lmao happy ending!! Well, not quite. I should also say by this time her new dude HATES me. He, uh, well he goes through her phone/social media all the time. Reads all her texts/DMs/etc. Goes through her purse. Just very jealous and has no trust— kinda like the opposite of me I guess. lol. Well, he read and doesn’t like the text messages I had sent her from a couple months back and especially the fact he found the pictures/videos she sent me while I was in rehab and forbids her to speaking to me. I mean, we still did/do, but whatever. We’re like best friends. But like when she sent those, and I sent her the messages I did, they weren’t even dating so whatever. When they started dating I cut things off again. Told her that she’s with dude and I’d be her friend, but I was giving up. She of course didn’t/doesn’t want me to, but that’s where we were. Well, she ended up using again, falling out, and her mom/dude found her in the bathroom. He calls her PO the next day— one of the things I did he hated me for (called me a snitch)— and she gets sent back to inpatient again. She got out beginning of November and we’ve still just been talking since. I mean, her and I never rly quit talking since we met. The only time pretty much was like those 2 months right after we broke up because I told her I would contact her when I was ready again. 

So, yeah, we’re like rly good friends. Like best friends really. We both trust each other and love each other and it’s just idk. It’s like nothing I’ve ever had. For as fucked up n toxic at times and confusing and idk. It just is what it is. 

So since she got out in early November we’ve kept our friendship up as we always have. It’s just a little different and not as open because we have to hide it from her boyfriend/future baby daddy. And since she’s been out she’s been sober. This past time combined with the fact she’s pregnant has really I think helped her for now. And I myself have been sober since I got out at the end of September or whenever it was. Except for one slip. My buddy— the one where me and this girl first met— passed away. And no, it wasn’t drugs. He had a blood clot in his stomach. It was sudden and just very unexpected. Him n I had been friends for about 20 years. And I planned on just drinking a shot n leaving one for him on the bar, but well, it was my wake up on why I cannot drink anymore because I couldn’t stop. But in the past 120days or so I relapsed once. I just never dealt with death before sober. Anyway, that doesn’t matter. 

So, one last thing and then I can get to my question stage and get some opinions I’m sure I won’t like. lol. So while my ex was in rehab this last time her dude started using again. Nodded out, burned tf outta her bedsheets, and just been lying to her and just all of it. Just getting high asf around her and giving no fucks. Hasn’t gotten a job, makes promises abt going back to school but doesn’t, keeps telling her he’s going to go to an IOP program and quit using, etc. All while he should be getting his shit together and saving and getting ready to take care of himself, my ex, and the baby. Mind you, I wanna say he’s 24, I think. Around that. Idk. But yeah, not my circus not my monkey. She made her bed there— quite literally. 

So this past weekend he left to go home to see his parents abt 4hrs away or so and was gone until today. And every day since he’s been gone my ex and I hung out. Went shopping and bought her son some Christmas gifts, went to the mall and walked around. We actually even kinda goofed around and went to the jewelry store and she tried on engagement rings. That was me being kinda sneaky there because it was sumin I always wanted to do with her when we dated that we never got to because of all the bullshit. Hell, we even found a rly nice one that she loved that was within my $7,000 budget (I think it was like $5,500 cuz it was 30% off, princess cut on a cushion kinda setting, carat and a half total weight, and sparkly asf). Lmao! But yeah, I mean we just had a great time all around. And I got to feed the fuck outta her. And I love feeding her. Lmao! Oh, another thing that should be noted is we both have eating disorders. I’m pretty much anorexic and she’s a chewer/spitter. Lmao!! We’re all kinda fucked over here, folks! But now that she’s pregnant she’s actually eating and taking care of herself, so I fed tf outta her finally! And we hung out a lot at her moms and just cuddled on the couch and watched tv n stuff. And no, we didn’t raw dog, or fool around or anything. It was for real just rly nice quality time that we hadn’t had in a long time now. Oh, and we exchanged Christmas gifts. I got her a Rick n Morty hoodie so she’ll quit trying to steal mine and she bought me a rly soft Animal Crossing blankie. Just small stuff, but we loved them. It was just a rly fun time. 

So like, this is now where the problem is. She told me a lotta stuff Monday night. She told me that I’m like the perfect guy and she was stupid asf for not seeing it. I told her she wasn’t stupid— we were both in active addiction n we both had problems. She said  she completely trusts me and she loves me— I mean we’ve always told each other we love each other, but I think she meant it a little differently this time. She told me she sees a future with me she doesn’t with him. She asked me if I still wanted to marry her— of course, yes I do; and just like a lot of other stuff. She told me she hadn’t planned on getting pregnant. Sent me a TikTok video of a daughter adopting her mom’s boyfriend and told me that could be me one day. Told me that she’s going to end up having 3 baby daddies because of me. And like a lot of other stuff. She’s not hiding the fact she’s interested in me still. 

But she also told me she does love this other guy, and she wants to give him a chance to step up and be a man. And I mean, I get it. She wants a clear conscience. She is pregnant with his baby after all. Like, I get her. I rly do. And I feel things like what she’s thinking. Ffs, I told her she was pregnant before she knew she was— dumb bitch owes me $50 for that btw! Lmao!! I’m just kidding abt calling her that, but frl. I was even the first person she told she was pregnant— even before her mother. Like I know why she wants to do what she’s doing, but it still sucks for me. And I told her I wasn’t waiting around for her. That if I find someone (even tho I’m not looking) I’ll still be her friend, but I mean it’s all her choice. And she said she wants to give him a chance to keep his word and be sober. To get off the boi— which ain’t gonna fucking happen at this point in his life. But she wants to give him a chance. I called her out on that and asked her if I’m just an option then and she told me no. She thinks of him more of as the option because she sees me being in her life longer than him. Idk. Makes no fucking sense. 

But I mean, even months ago when she first found out she was pregnant I told her I was giving up hope on us being anything more than friends and I was ok with just friends as long as I was in her life, and she told me that I was being stupid and that we can’t predict the future. That things could always change with us. 

Like I rly do love this woman. I do. With all my heart in a way I’ve never loved anyone, but I honestly don’t know wtf is going on in her head. And idk if she even does. She rly is smart asf, but like not at all when it comes to relationships. And maybe it’s because I’m 39 and she’s 26 and I was in a long ass relationship before her that I got a little more experience than she does when it comes to relationships, but idk. I mean, before her and I dated she dated her first baby daddy for 3 years and he was abusive asf to her. He got her hooked on shit and used it to control her. She doesn’t have many friends either. And like she’s insanely beautiful— like frl like model material, so most guys that come into her life rly only wanna try n fuck her, so she has bad history with that shit. And there’s been some sexual assaults in there too. So idk, I might be one of the few guys if any that’s actually treated her as not only a woman, but as a person. So there’s a lot going on in there I think. And I’m kinda at a loss on a lot of it. 

And like idk if it’s only her hormones making her think like this on top of it— even tho she kinda was saying some of this type of shit before she was pregnant. Like a lot of this is kinda just the same as how it’s been always been between us. And I wouldn’t mind being the step-up daddy to her unborn child, or to her first. I know it wouldn’t be easy, and there’s a lot that goes into raising a child/children, but I’m willing to do it. I’m willing to help her get her firstborn back and deal with all that court stuff. Like I will always, always fight for her and be there for her. I just want to help her and for her to have a happy life— whether or not it’s with me. 

But like I saw her yesterday before her boyfriend came back and I brought her some Chick-Fil-A (again, love feeding her n taking care of her) and like she literally sat on my lap and we just hugged and held each other for like 5-10min and then I got up to leave and we hugged again for a long ass time and then she kissed me on the cheek. I could tell she wanted to actually kiss me, but with her dating someone I knew she would’ve felt guilty and didn’t want to do that to herself— she said she already feels bad enough over all this as it is. Like again, I can feel what she feels and it’s super weird asf. 

I just rly don’t understand what’s going on here. Anyone got any advice or insight besides get away from her? Any questions I should ask her, or like any topics I should bring up next time we talk? Like foreal, this is the part im here for. I’m not exactly the best at this relationship shit if you couldn’t tell by now! Lmao! I’m much better at getting fucked up and NOT dealing with life. 

I mean, I’m still working on me. I got a 3 bedroom house a few months back, just started working a government job that pays well, and I’m going to start working on my TEFL certificate for a side huddle, and then in a few month pursue getting my real estate license. So it’s not like I’m not doing me still or this is occupying my entire life. It’s literally one of the few things that idk what to do about. 

I think I gave a pretty good history on us and what’s going on here, but if anyone wants clarification please feel free to ask questions.

2020-12-23 09:21:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kitxfz/what_is_addiction/,What is addiction?,"What is addiction? Is it a disease? If so, are we experiencing a pathological disease process when we become “addicted” to the naturally-rewarding endorphin release that comes with exercise? Are our addictions to the internet and coffee attributable to a ‘disease’ process too, or are those just habits, despite one (caffeine) having a basis on an actual, physical, chemical dependency?

When does a habit become an addiction — or an addiction become a disease — and how, exactly? Do various chemicals and drugs, themselves, cause a disease process in only THOSE specific addictions? Is gambling addiction a disease, even though there are no drugs involved? Does that make it a disorder as opposed to a disease? What’s the difference? Habit, addiction, disorder, disease — what do each of these words mean? More importantly, what do they look like in the brain?

As a result of the ongoing global pandemic, rates of alcohol and drug use, both pharmaceutical and otherwise, are skyrocketing, along with obesity. Against a backdrop of stress, fear, isolation, and actual or potential economic scarcity, more and more of us are developing maladaptive coping mechanisms like binge eating, binge drinking, and compulsive use of technology — even when we know that these actions will have adverse effects on our physical and mental health.

On top of these issues, many of us are succumbing to the depression and anxiety that so commonly co-occur with addictive disorders, and we might find that our bad habits accelerate and gain strength as our mental health deteriorates. Why is this so? What are the TRUE neural underpinnings of these experiences, divorced from any bought-and-sold biases? How can we use this knowledge to strengthen us?

It has never been more important for all of us to come to a collective understanding of exactly what addiction is, what is isn’t, how it happens, how we free ourselves from it, and how we can avoid it in the future or use it to our advantage. Addiction exacts an almost incalculably high financial and human toll on us here in the United States, as the total economic cost to society is greater than all types of diabetes and all cancers combined. That’s a lot.

As our life situations complicate and our problems are exacerbated, we might feel that our survivability is at risk. The rampant stressors of 2020 have triggered emotions that are primordial signals. Emotions are emotive; they come from a Latin root that means ‘causing movement’. Our emotions are our motivation; our motives. Emotions are signals. They’re designed to get us to do something — but what can we really do right now?

***tw- s/h, suic*de, drug talk***

i’ve been going through the whirlwind since a young age, started self harming at 12, first attempted suicide by 13, and then started drinking &amp; smoking &amp; dropped out of school by the time I was 14. I was always surrounded by addiction (my parents have been on drugs since I was born, dad only got clean a few years ago, mums still not clean) so it came somewhat naturally for me to pick up getting addicted to drugs &amp; alcohol by a young age after seeing it my whole childhood. 

last few years I’ve been in 2 pretty toxic relationships, both of which turned abusive, and the last one left me pretty mentally scarred after the breakup. After a few attempts at suicide, i started really detaching myself from myself &amp; the world around me. I didn’t want to be here at all, and that was all until I found spiritually (this isn’t me trying to push any hippy dippy stuff on you btw so dw😂) and it pushed me to be aware of everything around me. I also started watching some Stanford lectures on behavioural biology to try and take control of my own mental patterns &amp; trying to train myself to handle my emotional off swings better and my mental health. 

Anyway, things were looking a lot better for me, and I thought I’d found inner peace, I was meditating often, spending time drawing and dancing and singing like I used to do when I was younger, I was no longer this passion-less, lifeless corpse. I had inspiration to live &amp; genuinely believed I mattered. But then, due to some sad personal circumstances, Ive moved back to the hometown where all my friends from when I was 14 live, and just like that I’ve fallen down the rabbit hole of the bender life.

It’s been 63 days, not sober, I’ve never felt less myself. Since being on my little bender, I’ve almost ruined one of my closest friends relationships, I’ve let my family down, I’ve fought with my best friend so many times, I’ve ditched those I love to party. Last weekend it got to the point where i downed so much alcohol at the first party that by the time I got to the second party I could barely even think. I remember the first 5 minutes of the party at most, and within those 5 minutes I’d downed almost half of my smirnoff bottle. I can barely recall anything I did that night. I upset so many people being mean that night, I was apparently yelling at some of my closest friends. Every time I could actually control my body I’d drag myself to the bar in my friends back yard and ask for one of the boys to pour me a shot. I even downed a shot that was 90% alcohol while in this state and continued partying. Then I woke up in the morning &amp; heard that id had sex with a guy who I only remember for a brief second helping me walk around (this scared me because im the type of person who gets very uncomfortable about sex in general but as soon as I get drunk enough I know I get talked into it easily) I also woke up with a massive bruise on the back of my thigh. The guy had said we only cuddled then later confirmed that we had sex after a friend had told me &amp; I asked him over messages.


After all of this, I spent the entire next day throwing up so much, and due to always being intoxicated I had barely found time to eat during these past 9 weeks, so my puke was just liquid &amp; stomach acids. I genuinely wanted to die at how terrible I felt the next day. And then the messages started to roll in from all the people I’d upset that night. I’ve ruined so many relationships, I’ve put myself into a terrible position with trying to pursue an “adult” life, and I generally feel lost. It’s genuinely scared me &amp; I feel sick to the stomach thinking about what a state I got in. 

The fucked up thing is, the day before this was almost just as rowdy. I barely even remember doing lines that night because I was so drunk by that point. And it’s been like for the past 63 days. This night just pushed me to a breaking point. The only thing different about this time is I didn’t have my older male friends like I usually do helping me out to make sure I was safe. 

I’m planning on admitting myself into a rehab at the end of this year &amp; setting a New Years resolution of staying sober, also hoping to spend more time meditating and finding myself peace again. Any advice on how to keep myself motivated or anyone who can relate to this feel free to comment or message me about it. I’m really wanting any advice at all, anything would help. I feel as though if I don’t put myself into a rehab and work on my mental and physical health I’ll end up dead honestly. Even any comments about how rehab can be for a young adult who’s dealt with addiction for a few years would be very helpful.

—————————————————————

Note: I’m asking this in a few subs just to try and get as much advice/info as I can so my apologies if anyone ends up seeing this a few times 😅

Okay so I’ll try and keep this short and sweet but I’m a rambler so I’m sorry in advance 🥺

I’ve been clean (on Methadone) for about 11 months now and I’m over it. Major high fives to everyone who can do life sober but it’s not for me.

Before this I was a poly user, mainly Morph topped up with DHCs or Oxy, plus mixed benzos (I was a heavy benzo user tbh, mixing 4 or 5 types at a time in fairly large quantities), plus promethazine and a little weed.

I just got in 1 box each of 10mg diaz and 1mg alpraz tabs, to test my benzo tolerance. I have promethazine on the way and my true love, clonaz, due in the NY.

Every plug I know is dry on Morph right now or have jacked prices up, so I’m looking to go back to H/Fent tbh if I have to. 

Now, finally, to my question! While digging through my old stash box I found a single Oxy 20 pill, poor thing got lost I think 😂 and 3 boxes of Trams (50mg, 100 tabs per box) plus a few loose strips. There’s over 120 tabs on the strips.

I haven’t taken Oxy in a long long time and I’ve actually never taken Tramadol, I just sourced it for friends, ahem.

I’ve just taken my daily Methadone script (currently 55mg) and 10mg diaz, plus 1mg alpraz, to test my tolerance but I’m desperate to catch a nod. 

Is it even worth me taking the Oxy? Will it do anything at all? What about the Trams? How many do you guys think I’d need to take to feel good? 

It’s not much but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do in these crazy times 🤣

Happy nods friends and thanks for any help/advice 🖤

P.S I also have some Betahistine 8mg tabs, anyone know how it compares to Promethazine 25mg? I used to take 75mg 3-4 times a day.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9991734623908997}"

From that day I smoked at least one pipe nearly everyday, usually a lot more than one. I had a decent bit of money at the beginning so bought a lot frequently. After some time I was spending all of my money on it and was trying to pretend to the people who didn’t cut me out of their lives that I was clean. My face was completely gaunt and I felt ill always.  After 6 months I was miserable. After 12 more so. After 18 every day was hellish. I remember one time, I don’t want to write exactly what happened but one night I collapsed into tears and had never been in so much anguish nor do I think I ever will.

I already smoke and drink regularly, and can barely handle that, so it most certainly would not be a good idea for me to try any other substance than that. So I most likely won't.

2020-12-22 06:22:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ki3i9o/benzo_tapering_advice_needed/,Benzo tapering advice needed,"Hi!
I am currently trying to taper from alprozalam 6mg/day after being on it for a month 

(had a relaps in two stages: first a month of about 30-60mg of oxazepam/day, managed to quit that with i quick taper without it being TOO bad.but a couple of weeks after i starten again with the alprozalam... The relaps havn't been recreational, but also NOT prescribed by a doctor! Its been to handle my very bad C-PTSD, anxiety and agorafobia etc.) 

(EDIT: I've also gone through about 70-100Grams of pregabalin in almost a year, dosing once every 4 days, partly for recreational and partly for anxiety supression, but i had to quit because at the end i was having to take 3700mg doses to have any effect..) 

Using under this short amount of times wouldnt really be a problem for me if i hadnt already been addicted to benzos before,  i was prescribed nitrazepam 15mg/day for over 2,5 years and quitting that was HELL even with a 6month slow taper... After that i developed post-acute withdrawal syndrom, and ever since then i've been VERY prone to ""tindering"".... So every relaps gives me worse withdrawal even after a rather short time! And I often get myoclonic jerks/cramps during withdrawal and sometimes even tonic-clonic seizures if i taper to fast (or at the end of the taper even) 

I have already managed to taper down to 4mg/day and it hasnt been too bad, quite easy so far actually! 
I have a apointment with my doctor to make a plan for a controlled taper, but that is in over a week...and i've just run out of alprazolam! (only 2mg left!) 

So, here is my question; i just started today to switch over to diazepam for a more controlled taper using the Ashton manuals conversion table for benzodiazepines equivalece chart, and according to that my current 4mg alprozalam is equal to 80mg of diazepam (0.5mg.=10mg according to the chart) ... But that feels like a lot... At least a LOT more sedating!

So do you think i should lower the diazepam dose right away, maybe to 60mg or even 30-40mg/day!? or is that a bad idea!? 

I've seen several different equivalence tables and everyone contradicts each other! They say everything from 0,5mg alprazolam =10mg diazepam to 1mg =10mg, and it has gotten me kind of confused... 

As soon as I can see my doctor we can plan a real taper-plan, but i have to survive until then... 
The only other option i have been offered until then Is a ""cold turkey"" detox at an inpatient addiction emergency-facility (mostly used for heroin and alcohol detox) And that sounds pretty horrible! They said that they wouldnt give me any taper, and only give me a dose when i started to show very serious withdrawal... Like seizures and such. 

So, what do you think!? Should keep taking 80mg diazepam for a couple of days/a week until my next ""cut-point"", or do you think that is TOO much!?
(I also cant take time of from work right now, so i have to be able to function while working and can't be totaly mess while working!)

And I’ve been a regular at a strip club for years now. I don’t want to get into too much detail but I’ve realized that it’s done nothing but be detrimental to myself, my mental health, my relationships & my life. I HAVE made some genuine lasting friendships with the bartenders, as well as several of the girls working. On the other hand, I hate myself repeating the same self-destructive pattern I always do. This recent one is probably the worst one as has become a financial burden. As a gay woman in bumfuck egypt, I don’t get much attention from other women. It quickly became something I craved constantly, because I never got any attention or parent/child snuggling, hugs, kisses when I was a kid. 

 My kind nature and wanting so strongly to be loved or to feel love has led me to being used by girls that I was tricked into getting feelings for. I feel like a fool. 

Ive fallen into the typical trap and I’ve wasted so much money, and so much time on this one girl. Only to realize that I’m 90% likely being led on and that my 
money is all she wants, despite spending time outside of the club with her & participating in other activities with her. 

Basically the low down with her is: She is living with her roommate who HAPPENS to be her ex fiancé, he drives her everywhere, they fuck, shoot porn together. But yet she’s doing stuff with me (nothing really sexual) but saying stuff to me of that nature, giving me false promises and is telling me she doesn’t want anything serious. Something about it fucking reeks to high heaven. And I’m getting the feeling that I’m being hustled. & it hurts. 

In the beginning of this “relationship” I went from being treated like a person to being treated like a transaction. 


I guess I’m just trying to make sense of all of it, and I’m trying to understand why the hell people just straight up lie and care about material things more than people themselves. I do support sex workers, and I know that not all of them are like that. I’m happy that it’s Christmas time because everything will be closed and I can refrain from going. I admit that I have a problem and it’s cost me money, friends, tension with my family and my self esteem. 

I’m putting my foot down and refusing to spend any more money on this girl. It might not be much and it might be cold turkey and a bit extreme but it’s a start I think.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.997214138507843}"

Help!,"Since Covid I have spent over 2500 hours on gaming including using youtube, twitch, reddit, articles, etc.  I withdrew from a semester of college losing a lot of money (I honestly haven't checked yet to see how much). I had to quit 2 jobs because I wasn't a student anymore. I lost an RA  job I really enjoyed that was opening doors for my future. My health has been on the decline. Not only have I lost muscle from lack of exercise, but I have lost hair, my skin has gotten bad, and I developed back pain. My relationships with family as well as my friends have greatly suffered. Even the friends I game with, my relationship hasn't been the best recently because I think excessive gaming has changed how I act. I have been lying about how much I play even with them. 

Historically,  growing up I used to occasionally binge on a game for a couple days but then eventually get a feeling of unaccomplishment and quit. I would do this maybe a few times a year, but I never let it get in the way of other things like school. I got a 4.0, top of my high school graduating class. Along with that I was an Eagle scout, read around 30-40 books a year, taught myself robotics, and ran cross country and track. In my late teens I played very little video games. When I was 20 some roommates of mine got me started playing games. At first I only played here and there maybe 10 hours a week but at the beginning of this year it became about 20. Around when my school became pass/fail in April 2019 for covid I started playing 40-80 hours a week. This trend continued till now. I had a part time job over the summer and managed life fine. When this semester started I had two part time jobs as well as a full class schedule. As much as I hated myself for it I kept playing at least 40 hours of video games a week. I wasn't putting in enough hours into my jobs (online TA and RA) and was missing many school assignments. I decided to withdraw from all my classes half way through when I was projected to get at best a C in all of them. 

Now in theory I could probably get my life back on track very quickly. I can start a new college semester in a couple weeks. I can go back to exercising, cooking, reading, and talking with friends and family every day. I can probably find a new job within a month. Within a few months my health will be much better and my social life will be good. This is super encouraging, but at the same time I'm not sure how likely it is. I could also in theory scrape by in an apartment with a part time job still playing games most of the time. I want to quit so bad, but even the thought of not playing tomorrow makes my stomach hurt. 

What should I expect as I try to quit? Should I go cold turkey? Should I stop talking with the friends I game with? Should I meet with a therapist?  What is the protocol? I would love some sincere help especially from someone who has experience with this sort of thing.

They say that its probably not actual addiction, because i have times where i dont use anything and then i go out of my way to use. Also that just having intense thoughts isint really a sign of addiction if im not actually using.

I had a time where i would use alot of stuff and for a long period of time, and they keep pointing that out as ""real addiction"". I mostly think they dont understand for aggressive and intense my thoughts get, and that they probably dont want to see me as an addict and kinda paint a different picture so its easier to deal with for themselves, cus its not really a nice thing to realise that your partner is infact, an addict.

They are amazing, fantastical man made creations that delight, inspire, encourage, and revitalize men and women of the world every day. 

But like anything ingested, smoked, or generally partaken in to excess, there are harmful side effects and negative repercussions to accompany those indulgences.  

Booze, weed, food, sex, porn; Our first experiences with these vices can lead us to overindulge. We learn too much, too often that they can alter the course of our lives and take us down a different path from the one we had once envisioned for ourselves. It’s only when we take a hard look back and realize how far we have strayed from that once imagined path that we realize a need for ‘sobriety’ or change. But when our self worth and self ability are constantly in doubt, those indulgences become self written prescriptions to alleviate our mental and/or physical woes. That takes us further down the path of self hatred, withdrawal from society, and quite possibly self destruction - literally or figuratively. 

With that in mind, I pose a question. What happens when our digital lives take over our real ones; when we are too busy looking down to notice the people and world around us and when our addiction manifests itself as an extension of ourselves & becomes integrated into our social norms and mores?

I have been clean for almost four years after eight years of daily drug abuse. I went to rehab and went to 12 step meetings and so on for maybe two years. The last two years of my life i have quit meetings since i don´t seem to need them to stay clean. So far so good.

My problem is that i have what i would call an addictive personality/i am an addict. I assume that many of you have the same problem, and i am curious about how you handle your lives due to this problem?

I feel like i have to eliminate everything that i find pleasurable in life since i get addicted to it. If i have an orgasm while having sex with my gf i want to cum all the time and i start watching porn and  get stuck in that, not good. So i have to do NoFap and avoid having an orgasm during sex.

I can not play video games, not even on my phone. I can not eat candy or cake or something that i enjoy eating because that will make me binge eat and gain 1kg/2pounds a week.

I have fully accepted that i can never drink alcohol or do drugs again, do i have to realise that i can´t have sex, eat candy or play games neither or what do you think? How is it for you?

It feels like i had better controll in these areas earlier in my life but that might have been because the drugs was my main addiction. 

I have also been thinking that it´s my mindset that is the problem. If i think that i can´t game, have sex or eat unhealthy it becomes the truth, that what i have learned about addiction in 12 step programs have made me think and therefore act in this very addictive way.

I would like to be able to do these things in moderation but i might have to stop them all together forever to not be compulsive with them.

I noticed that when it comes to moderation with substances, I struggle, to say the least. I am 3 months alcohol free (yay!) . I had to decide one day that I wouldn't do it anymore, I had been telling myself for a long time that I needed to stop, and I realized, I am not able to consume it in moderation, so I should not consume it at all. I can't say that I've been sober for 3 months though because I use cannabis everyday in amounts that I am becoming uncomfortable to depend on.  I've been in denial for a while but the psychedelics I've used and the thc intake i rely on is really having bad long term effects on me. I've been in denial about this for a few years. Even writing this is quite difficult for me, because it makes it more real. I tell myself that I will eventually only use cannabis on weekends, and a much reduced amount. I know myself better than that though, I don't think I have the self control. When I've tried to take baby steps towards reduction of use, I always relapse. I don't blame myself, but I feel like I need to set a boundary and say ""no more weed"". Quitting alcohol honestly has really been a helpful step in making me aware of the positive ripple effect it made in my life to change that habit. I feel more in control, I feel more hope to be mentally stable (I have a few chronic mental illnesses). Ultimately I know that I am addicted to marijuana and I am trying to come to terms that I may actually have to cut it out completely to give myself a chance at sobriety. I just worry that I'll miss it too much, or that I will keep relapsing which will make myself feel even less in control. I know that addiction has affected my family members, so I try to think about how I can avoid losing myself to substances. I guess I just wanted to vent into the void, these thoughts have been weighing me down and I've been looking for a sign to quit. an a-ha moment. I feel like I'm taking my body for granted despite being so grateful for all it does to keep me healthy. I just worry that I won't enjoy life without weed, or know how to cope. I want to just enjoy it as a treat but I don't have the will power. Also, last thought: I want to acknowledge that I honestly feel a little anxious posting this because I have internalized the ""you can't get addicted to weed"" statement. I think maybe my addiction is just psychological maybe? I don't know if any of this even makes sense, please be gentle in the comments, I am feeling quite nervous. But thank you for reading.

I lost my self-respect,"It completely changed the way I interacted with women in general. I lost my self-respect. Made it harder for me to be friends with women

It all started when I was introduced to pornography when i was 12yrs old. My friends encouraged me to watch and fap. And that's how I destroyed myself. After some time, for atleast 6 months, I fapped every single day. It weakened me. And coupled with fact how the Indian ""romance"" films glorify stalking and harrassing, i was completely clueless on how to interact with women. For some time, i looked at every girl at my age smiling at me, like she's giving me a clue. It affected my self-confidence. That made me more lonely, so watched more porn and fapped, which made me even more lonely, trapped in a vicious cycle. All these years of fapping, my schlong has never been the same - it now has blisters, etc.

Sex is everywhere. in advertisments, in music videos, in films. It is difficult for me to avoid these pathways, especially how easy is it in Reddit to view porn. I'm making it harder for myself to access porn, like some website blockers. I'm also becoming more religious (don't comment ""reLiGioN iS BAd!""), focusing more on myself, getting back on my fitness, interacting with more people (before pandemic) and just making myself busy

But still, i have struggle interacting with women in general. Help me

When we first started hanging out(before dating) we were both very much addicted to drugs, but never used together, than after a year of being friends we finally started dating, we both go clean when we started dating. We both used suboxone to get off of herion/pills. I was a snorter and he was a needle user. So when we stopped, I 100% stopped, however he continued to shoot up his subs for a little while and I caught him and threatened to leave. After this he finally stopped and I could tell he stopped by his attitude and change in habits. So now 4 years later we have a home, 2 beautiful children's, and life and hes opening his business. 
However we had a situation come into our home that was difficult for both of us in every way. We got temp custody of my niece, now sadly this situation almost destroyed us for a multitude of reasons. But we ended up transferring custody back thankfully. Anywho, I noticed my husband was acting different, he was cagey and secretive, and started gaslighting me again when I'd ask him about stuff or get very defensive, ive noticed subtle slight changes in his behavior. We both have talked about how we never want to relapse or be back where we were before and how it could make us loose everything. But something feels off. When we very first moved in together I was so paranoid that he was using needles that I'd hunt the apartment all the time for needles but never found any. Now I find myself doing the same thing again. I don't think he's slipped back into herion but I'm afraid he may be shooting up his prescription again. He has little dogs on his arm that to me I can't tell if it's injection marks or if it's just red bumps that he always gets on his skin, but I'm afraid it's injection marks because it's right by his healed scars. I haven't found anything yet but I'm afraid that he's just that good at hiding it from me, all of our money is shared and I haven't seen any strange charges but I know he gets tips at work sometimes or uses cash app, or sometimes just has cash. I don't know how to talk to him about it because it's something that he's obviously very defensive about. However i need to know so I can get him help before it gets worse, because as well all know, it always gets worse.

I've read books, watched YouTube videos, come to realisations about the causes of my addiction, done insane amounts of exercise, but I can't shake them, and I'm stuck in a vicious cycle.

I can give them up for around 2 weeks maximum, usually working out hard and studying hard in the process. Eventually, the cravings become too intense and I relapse and will spend maybe a week or so afterwards doing literally nothing and succumbing to gluttony and lust by spending absurd amounts of time binging on porn and junk food. After that week I'll become disgusted with myself and motivate myself to try and get clean again, only for the cycle to begin again.  I've been living in this cycle non-stop for almost a year now, and it is literally killing me. Typically after a week of binging, I would be able to motivate myself to try again, but it's becoming harder and harder, and sometimes I honestly just want to give up. For the first time in my life, I've been starting to drink on weeknights just to numb the anxiety and self-disgust.

I have no idea what to do anymore. My parents don't want me to go back to my therapist, and I don't have many people I can turn to for support, I've been pretty isolated for the past few years.

I’ve been curious whether what I’m feeling is a relapse or something larger that I need to see a therapist for. Essentially, I told myself I would quit nicotine and alcohol between December 1st and Christmas Day. I made it 10 days and felt great, but I also felt like an overly-serious boring person to be around. I gave myself a cheat day with my roommates, and then could NOT get back on the sobriety train. I woke up without any guilt, but I was tired so I picked up some cigs the next day and told myself I would be sober and that two days meant nothing. Then something changed. My convictions changed, how much importance I gave to quitting changed, the feelings I had about myself and what I was trying to achieve changed. Now I am experiencing delusion-like things, feeling as if I was in a universe where I was on the right path for me, and my decision to break my sobriety took me out of that universe. My temporary sobriety was going to lead to fulfillment, lifting others up, and being healthy and happy and almost being a best version of myself. Now I look at my life and I feel like a completely different person after only 8 days of breaking my 10 day sobriety. I don’t have the same feelings I did before, and I kind of just want to get drunk and nicotined-up now. I literally cannot feel the conviction not to drink or smoke cigs even though logically I know I need to quit.

Have you heard the expression that sugar is more addicting than coke? In my case it is. To a point where it is devastating my life. I have done coke a few times, but never ''caught'' the addiction as it is said I should everywhere. The stuff was OK for me, but nothing special. Sugar on the other hand? I remember stealing money as a kid from family members to buy candies...In fact, during the last year of college, I decided to drop drinking (another sin of mine from an early age that had gotten out of hands) and eating empty calories altogether. Cold turkey. It coincided with November, therefore I threw in NoFap challenge as well, why not? Here are the results. I have remained sober for the past 2 year. I abstained on NoFap for a month and 2 weeks, I think - it was never a huge problem for me anyways, so no biggie. Sugar? I lasted whole EIGHT days without it... -\_-

Backstory: My mom would always put sweets in different places around the house, but, for a major period in my youth, I remember looking for the precious as first thing after coming home. As soon as I stepped in. Seems pretty sick to me.

After going off to college and ramping up my gym going activity, I somehow left the habit behind me. That continued for around 3 years, rather successfully. However, after picking up a quite stressful work position with a heavier workload, I returned to my bad habit. I would eat junk food and stuff late at night, after work, right before going into sleep. That would worsen my already insufficient sleep schedule. I ate even when not hungry. There have been multiple day ''rampages'' where my diet consisted only of junk food and candies... Having an active lifestyle and job this was very sabotaging for my energy levels, yet I managed to keep it up for around a year. Somehow... I do wonder how I haven't got diabetes so far, especially when my grandmother does from birth.

I now understand that my ongoing fight with depression has had a hand in things happening this way. Unfortunately, I got fat, and that made even more depressed - with candies being my comfort food. The money I have WASTED in all the candies I've eaten alone. Crazy sums now that I think of it. I just can not help myself. Rationally, I know they are not good for me - I am quite educated in nutrition and sports science. But it is almost as if someone else controls my hands/mouth when I spot sweets. I cant help my self :(

So, why is this such a big problem? Imagine this 6'3'' muscular, bearded male specimen going into a grocery store specifically for buying flashily packed, rainbow colored sweets. The looks I'd get from people there... It looks so ridiculous, even I sometimes laugh at myself. :) Aside from that, I find myself exercising less and less. As I mentioned, there is also the cost issue (crazy). I tend to keep this habit a secret from everyone because of shame. Unnecessary stress if you ask me.

This is not a willpower issue. By age 14 I still hadn't fallen into peer pressure for smoking, so I promised myself I would never start. I never have - not a single cigarette. Yet, for my sweets issue, I am incapable of making myself follow up with the decision. With marijuana edibles (and other forms), i.e., I can do it for a day or two and then forget about it even existing for months...

Anyone has any words of wisdom? Now that I have written all this down, it makes me feel even sillier. ;l",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968771934509277}"

2020-12-18 09:14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kflune/please_dont_laugh_nsfw/,Please don't laugh [NSFW],"Its 2006, I'm 14 years old and Im in the bathroom playing my gameboy. The battery dies and I'm in there bored on a Saturday. Out of the crags of my mind came a memory from a year ago, like a dog stretching and shaking itself after waking up, of a conversation I overheard in class.

""Dude, try it. Its the best!""
""How?""
""Well...you just grab it and shake it around.""
""No way, you're lying. When I peed it don't feel like that""
""You gotta do it like I said! I saw it on a tape""

Why that memory only came back just then, I'm not too sure, but I was bored and curious. 
Looking back, even though I didn't know what I was doing, something in me still told me to check and make sure mom wasn't home(my dad was working).
Coast was clear. I get in our computer and search ""shake it around and feel good"" and stumbled on to some obscure site full of "" pretty women putting their mouths on dude's things"". I didn't know why I liked it, but I liked it. After getting an eye full and seeing what happened if you did it long enough, I wanted to try myself. I flipped off the computer and book it towards the bathroom.

I go back in the bathroom and jump out of my pants, my breath getting heavy for some reason. I could feel a grin creeping it's way across my lips as I pulled my boxers down and my erection bounced free. I begin doing what I saw in the video, but didn't really like the feeling of my dry hand. Then I remember my mom had this really nice lotion.

I about break down the door getting to it, and when I do, I squirt some in my hand and run back like I struck gold.

Heart is pounding. Grinning ear to ear. I try again and it's like I'm holding heaven in my hand. I go crazy and keep going until it's starts to feel ""funny"". Something shoots out. 
Then the door opens and my dad is standing there. He didn't scream. I didn't get disciplined. He told me to wash off and sit down. He told me how what I had just done was something I shouldn't do. I was terrified. Did I break a law? Am I going to have to go to the doctor? He kinda laughed but said ""just don't do that...or you'll go blind."" I swore right then I'd never do it again. 

For the next 13 years, I never missed a day. Guilt always flooding in after the orgasm ended. But still finding new ways to get off. It was like fighting with an ex and still getting back together. But, this time, I'm not going back. 

Its been a month and a week. I feel like I could lift a building, but I'm fine other than that.

Im trying my best and learning to work and clean my house and eat healthy and I'm actually amazed at how that can work as corny as it is. I still smoke pot and I know that's not 100% clean but I have learnt my boundaries and I only smoke at night after work. It's amazing the way using your body to work and earn your way can feel so good. I'm not claiming I'm perfect or even that my drug use is 100% over. But I have somehow cut the drugs out that a year ago I could never see myself clean and never wanted to be. Now I don't even think about it anymore.

My friend (18y Female) who I (20y Male) care deeply about traveled from Massachusetts to a Drug rehab in California called Ban Yan treatment center. However ive been doing some research into drug rehab scams and the're are a few things that are bothering me. https://www.mass.gov/service-details/avoiding-addiction-treatment-scams

 
 First off from my understanding the rehab payed for her flight, which seem slightly unusual. 

  
 Also when she went into Php she was allowed to leave the first week as long as she left w/ someone who's been there for awhile. Apparently she ordered a tattoo gun and got a hotel room with other clients there to give each other tattoos. Anyways that day she ended up going to walgreens and drinking. Even though she relapsed and was caught, still she was allowed to go out by herself the next day since her week was over. As well I feel like that dosent sound right? Also she is acting like she is serious about recovery but dosent want her mom to know she relapsed?

  
 Now she's saying she wants to stay in Palm Springs, CA in a sober home. This makes no sense to me, if you where going to do sober living for 6 months wouldn't you want to do it closer to your home near Boston, MA so you can actually form a positive support group back home? Like she is going to be away for 8 month then come back to the same people/places and feel even more lonely. 

 
  Its just eating away at me lately and I want to say something to her but idk if I'm just paranoid or justified, if that makes sense. When I asked if shes working the 13 steps she said they don't do that there! Im getting this vibe that she's in a flip house and its really bothering me.
  
 
  I've been checking in on her every once in awhile since she got her phone back. But I noticed that she started getting dismissive in her texts. 
When I confronted her about it she said,


 ""I mean it's fine I obviously care about you. However I am trying to focus on myself and surround myself with positive influences n shit so that's why I've been kinda distant. I mean even when we were hanging out that's why I kept saying I need to focus on myself. I'm not trying to cut you off I'm just trying to distance myself.""


All I said was, 


 ""K its cool. Didn't realize I was tht much of a toxic influence in ur life. Im glad you found new friends that care and are good for u.At least u told me. At the end of the day you need to do whats best for you and if the friendship was hurting you I guess why stay""


She replied w/ ""you seem really salty lol""


A week later after not hearing from her she just texts me


Yo they're are sending me back to detox


 And when I asked if she relapsed she said yea. When I asked what happened and for her to call me she never did. 


 I'm really worried about her but its also agreviating me that she says she wants to distance herself from me but then keeps on texting me that she relapsed w/out elaborating. Am I right to be somewhat agrivated? I understand that addiction is hard but it seems like she is just staying in California because she likes the escape from home not for actual help.


I'm just so lost, she dosent seem like herself at all. Part of me feels a bit disappointed like all I ever did was support her. Just feel like I was just used as an emotional pillow the thrown to the side once she was surrounded by others.


Would it be selfish to express my frustration to her while she's in recovery? Like I know I should focus on myself but its hard when you really care about someone:(


Tl;Dr My friend who I really care about keeps hitting me up with her problems but says she wants to distance herself from me but still keeps telling me about her relapsing w/out elaborating. Its been stressing me out as I want to be there and support her. But it seems like she can't make up her mind if she wants to distance herself from or keep me in her life.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985968470573425}"
2020-12-18 00:47:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kffa3p/ive_gotten_addicted_to_dph_during_the_past_year/,"I’ve gotten “addicted” to DPH during the past year, and I need help stopping.","I hate the idea of having a DPH addiction, because it sounds *wrong*. I have family members who are addicted to real substances. Alcohol, weed, meth, coke, etc. etc. etc. 

Apologies for the long post. I’m scared, upset, and tired. TL;DR at the bottom. 

It’s not so much I have an addiction to DPH and enjoy getting “high” (because let’s be real. It’s more a DPH-dependence. DPH-high causes some of the WORST nights of my life. Hallucinations, hearing things, seeing things, feeling like I’m going to fall over if I stand, roll over, or walk to the bathroom, constantly peeing, feeling nauseous, losing the ability to feel my limbs, etc etc etc.) 
But the one thing DPH does do, is keeps me asleep. After hours of absolute agonizing pain, I’m asleep during the entire day, and therefore I don’t eat. 

Oh, I guess I should start my post off with this — Yes I am severely depressed and have tried SSRIs back in high school. Was an awful feeling I hated it, and never wanted my “happiness” to depend on a pill. But my depression isn’t actually the reason for the DPH-dependence. But actually, it’s my eating disorder. Which could be tied to my depression, I suppose. But it’s more of a mental issue I have just with *me* and my body. I have bad body dysmorphia, and have struggled with my body for a *very* long time. I developed bulimia 8 years ago, and I would go running 2x a day for 90 minutes. I stopped eating, unless it was dinner, because that was the only time of day when I felt okay purging. Sometimes I’ll purge 2+ times a day, but usually just the once after dinner. 
My bulimia and depression have pushed me to find as many ways as I can to just sleep, and also abuse laxatives. 

Without going to snooze city, basically, I’ve been severely depressed for a very long time in my life. I had taken SSRIs for a short period in my life. Getting on and off them was absolute hell. Headaches 24/7, nausea, weight gain, etc. I was only on them for maybe 2 years at most and then decided to quit cold-turkey. Back in high school, I wasn’t allowed near medicine at all because it was dangerous, and so my dad would leave my anti-depressant on my dresser every morning before he left for work. I started collecting them, and hid them away. 

That was ~3 years ago and I had been fine for the most part. 2020 took a BIG toll on me. Back in March when I was furloughed, I was at home all the time. Didn’t go anywhere, I could’t go to the gym or school, etc. I’ve also been dealing with both an eating disorder and depression for 6+ years, and being home doing nothing, living a sedentary lifestyle, and only really eating took a hit on me mentally too. It was the point I was gaining weight and that is an incredibly hard thing for me to accept. 

Anyways, since mid- to late-March, I’ve been taking *some kind* of pill or substance to sleep. At first it was a couple benadryl tablets, since just 2 of those would knock me out. Then it was melatonin tablets. Once I ran out of those, I took liquid melatonin with 10mg of melatonin per dropper. Eventually the melatonin just wasn’t cutting it and was getting expensive, so I went back to benadryl. When I started going through benadryl, I started adding acetaminophen PM.

There’s been about 3 weeks total since March that I haven’t taken any medicine to sleep, and it’s because I was camping or on the beach or somewhere other than my home. I didn’t go back to work and I didn’t have to get serious about school until September. I’ve taken classes every quarter for the past two and a half years. But most of it, because of COVID, has been moved online. I never had to be awake and present in class at the scheduled time, so it was another excuse to let me sleep. 

For the last few months, it’s been handfuls of benadryl and handfuls of Acetaminophen PM, and alcohol. Whatever gets me to sleep. It used to be because I panicked being alone, so I had to KO before my partner left so I wouldn’t notice. But now I’m awake when they leave, and I’m just disoriented and out of touch. Most of the time I don’t even zonk out until ~4am but then I don’t get up until like 6pm. Which was good for my mental health because I didn’t have to face the day and I wasn’t eating [and therefore lost weight]

Now whenever I go more than two days without taking anything I get a bad headache. It isn’t even anything I can’t handle, but when I get headaches it’s like my whole body shuts down. I’ve developed minor dyskinesia, my body is twitching all the time, I have awful short term memory, and the entire year has become a blur. 
 Additionally, if I *am* awake during the day, I end up eating at some point and that’s an entire other battle I’ve got to fight with. i get anxious, guilty, and depressed if I eat, so it’s just better to be asleep for me. 

My boyfriend says I have a very minor addiction, but that sounds ridiculous to me. I know people out there who are really struggling with a true addiction. So me saying I’m addicted to benadryl not only *sounds* awful, but makes me feel like a f*cking loser. Getting professional help is the absolute biggest waste of time and money for me. I’ve been in and out of the hospital after overdosing, connected to many many therapists, etc. It always just ends up being a waste of time & money, and I feel guilty because my dad got a $5,600 medical bill because an ambulance has to pick me up from my high school and drive me about half a mile  

So, anyways.

I am an addict who is closing in on 9months sober this go around and have found myself once again playing a game I have enjoyed since my childhood and know that there is a lot of different types of people that play RuneScape Old-school and RS3. If you are unfamiliar with the game, I'm not looking to advertise it or try to convince anyone that it will help them stay sober, it's just a game and I find it to be a fun way to spend some of the free time I have so that I don't succumb to idle hands or my destructive thoughts.

However when I play I usually find myself trying to make friends and it's not always easy players are busy, or already established/have the friends they talk to or are in a clan they are apart of.

That being said I believe that there are other people like me who play this game and understand what it means to me and how even when I've lost everything in real life then reacquired just to lose again, the game was still there and starting over has shown me I can.

The only thing is I'd love to have friends to talk with in game that are in recovery, or are curious about recovery, or simply just want to be part of something that might get them or a stranger through one more set of 24 hours. I did some digging and seem to have been unable to discover a group that has anything to do with recovery.

Therefore I have decided to reach out to communities I know of where I might be able to reach people that play and would like to be apart of a clan that is there for one another to enjoy Sober Scaping with. If by chance you play, or know someone in recovery or is in the life of someone who's an addict. or simply someone who just wants to be positive support for one another in a virtual setting feel free to direct message me on here.

TL/DR;I quit shooting fent but I still play Runescape and would like friends who are also in recovery to support one another.

What I post may not fit the forums primary objective, or the views of our members. I also may receive some hate for this post. I feel very rather enthusiastic right now and wanted to voice some beliefs I have.

So my background is that, in early 2018 I was admitted into my first of four residential inpatient programs for my ‘addiction’  to heroin (IV) and Xanax (Oral). Albeit i purely abuse drugs, I was able to live with multiple great peoplewho had similar issues , bipolar disorder mostly  

As i discharged from the most recent Outpatient treatment center,  I noticed the nurses and other employees “aggressively” voice to me that my addiction is a brain disease because it “kills brain cells” or another reason. I honestly believed this ‘phenomenon’ during my first rehab experience.Unfortunately,  I relapsed multiple times  and began to convinced myself that 

In a very general sense, rewarding events/actions in life (such as intimacy or eating food) result in dopamine being pumped from the Ventral Striatum (midbrain) to destinations like the Nucleus Accumbens (striatum). For the most part, this action allows us to pursue and focus on tasks that seemingly benefit us. However, regions of the brain, importantly the Prefrontal Cortex, can override some impulsive thoughts and assist us in self regulating our desires. 

When someone pursues a goal like talking to their crush or eating food, the same actions (albeit to a lesser extent) that i stated above for drug addiction can occur - dopamine being pumped to the reward regions of the brain. 

I recently stumbled upon Marc Lewis, a neuroscientist, former addict and a very popular advocate for addiction studies. One of his best quotes in his lectures told us that  “[When people call] Addiction a disease it suggests that the brain can no longer change…that it’s an end state.” Because of this idea, I’ve heard my fellow addicts tell me that a hard relapse is always justified because you can’t help it.

Personally I would argue that addiction is a habit that escalates itself relatively quickly when we repeatedly pursue the same highly attractive goal. This results in new pathways being built in the brain, which is always the case with learning: new pathways are formed and older pathways are pruned or eradicated. 

After i voiced some of these beliefs to others in my outpatient treatment program, I was met with a lot of hate and detest, and boy did that make me feel like shit.

For you, the reader, I ask you to voice your personal opinions on the phenomenon of addiction and whether or not should be classified as a brain disease.

&#x200B;

Every single night I go through this same cycle. Maybe it's because it's something I got used to about 8 years ago. I was in Middle School when I first discovered just how many women were out there on the internet, willing to be sexual with me. It started with harmless online games which had chatrooms - that's where shit really went down. It was a tic tac toe online game chatroom, and plenty of girls my age were down to talk dirty in the DMs.

When Snapchat came along, that changed the game. I could try getting nudes/talking dirty to girls i actually KNEW in real life. I had no interest in sex with them in real life. I just wanted them to fantasize about me. Why? 

&#x200B;

This is the question I still struggle with, as I go through websites like Omegle paying for women to show me the most obscure things just for attention. Lately, I've been watching them play with their feet (something I know they wouldn't do unless I were paying them). The worst part is I have no interest in being with them in real life. Why do I crave female attention so much? Without a woman knowing that I came, I feel like I wasted my time jerking off... and now that it's over, I feel disgusted with myself. I then immediately distract myself and forget what just happened. 

&#x200B;

In fact, it feels like that part of me is just a whole other person. Is this bipolarity? (kind of like fight club?)

Quick background: I met this girl about a year ago and it was obvious she drank quite a bit but now its clear she has a serious problem.

She goes through several bottles of whiskey a week. She's rarely like falling down wasted but when we hang out I'll slowly notice that she's drunk. I've stopped accepting rides from her because of it. She told me she never has an appetite, can't sleep at night, goes through bouts of depression and always feels ill. On top of that she's overweight and she told me she is $40,000 in debt. Covid is obviously not helping any of this. 

She has said that she wants to pay down her debt, get in shape and cut back on her drinking. I am pretty goal orientated and organized so I've offered to help her get her finances in order so she can start clearing her debt. Her spending habits are horrendous and I think if she organized and set some limits she could put a dent into it. I've also offered to work out and cook with her to help her form good habits but she hasn't taken me up on anything. I don't want to be pushy or condescending or make her feel like she's my project so I've only offered gently a couple of times. 

I'm most worried about the drinking, I think she needs to go to rehab but I don't see the point of telling her that because I know she wont go. She can't afford it for one thing but I know she wont go anywhere for a long period of time if she can't bring her dog. She knows she drinks too much so its not like she's in denial. She seems to want all of these problems to go away without having to put any effort or make any changes. 

I can't relate to depression or addiction so I don't really know how to be helpful. I don't want to be cruel or have an attitude that she should just do this or just do that and be all better but she does need to put in some effort if she wants to bring about change. But she doesn't seem to want to.

Later in the day id have a few more caffeinated sodas and if I was up late id switch to non caffeinated ones. Usually my caffeine intake would equal about 2 cups of coffee but I certainly went over that pretty often.

Yesterday for some stupid reason I had it in me to just not have any caffeine, mostly to prove to myself that I still can. Turns out I can't. Withdrawal hit me like a ton of bricks right in the middle of my day (I'm on my last week of virtual school so you can see how that'd be a problem). I never thought I had a problem with this before but considering I'm still sitting on a raging headache and feeling like shit, something needs to be done.

I'm pretty out of my depth here. Won't go into why but my parents aren't exactly gonna be a resource for me. So like a good gen-zer I come crawling to the internet for help. Anything would be helpful at this point.

How death saved my life.,"Addiction has been a huge struggle for most of my life. My DOC is IV meth. I had a good chunk of clean time until I was raped in Iraq by a fellow soldier in 2011. The next almost decade has been filled with death and drug use. 8 soldiers to suicide, one of whom was a close grieve and lover, multiple family members, friends. My dog. My mom and dad. Then I found my real dad. My best friend went to prison. We were really close. Like platonic soul mate close. She got out. On July 8, we got high. I went home. On July 10 I got the call at 12am that my dad had passed away from alcoholism. The next day, I found out my best friend had also died on the 10th of heroin overdose. I was crushed. So angry. Absolutely destroyed. That moment caused something to click in my brain. I haven't used since that day on July 8th. I made a promise to her mother that I wouldn't use again. I made a promise to her childhood best friends. Most importantly, I made a promise to myself that I would not let her death be in vain. I've made a commitment to sobriety. All my paraphernalia is gone. Online meetings are a thing now. We still have in person meetings. I got a face shield so I could go. (PTSD and masks don't mix. I can wear one to run into the store real quick. For a 90 minute meeting, I'll wear a shield.) This is the most sober time I've had since 2011. I think the one thing I was missing was that total commitment. I will not use. Her death has to mean something and this is the only way I can make sense of it. I'm looking forward to Jan 8th. Six months clean is a huge accomplishment. I haven seen this in a very long time. So, I'll be there. In person to collect that chip. I haven't collected any of the others because I've done all that before. 6 months. It's so fucking big. I miss them all so much. Greiving while sober is literally the hardest thing I've ever done. Being present in that grief. Feeling that grief. It's horrible. It's also so, so cleansing. I'm nurturing my grief like I nurtured my addiction. Paying attention to it. Processing it. I'm letting the tears come. I'm letting the laughter come. I'll grow Sunflowers in her honor in the spring. I'll make sure there's a trucker hat and a guitar in there for my dad.

Here is my experience of addiction and recovery.,"There is a sound that can only be heard by a small percentage of the population in New Mexico.  This sound is somewhat of a low hum, a rumbling in the ears.  Many scientific researchers have taken their shot at finding the origin of this anomaly that these unfortunate souls claim to hear.  I say unfortunate because “the hum” as it came to be known, is constant.  If you or I heard it for a moment we would simply be amused by the oddity of it, but these people in New Mexico hear it all the time.  As they eat, brush their teeth or try to fall asleep they hear the hum.  The rumble, uninvited, becomes a part of these people's lives.  Some have sought doctors, some have tried remedies from both the East and the West… and some are driven so mad by it that they take the only known rememdy… the way of suicide.  

When I heard of this hum, it was the closest I had ever come to finding a way to describe anxiety.  And my brand of anxiety wasnt just any run of the mill anxiety.  Mine was the concentrated stuff.  The kind that can only live by growing parasitically from large deposits of shame.  It produces a prodding and dull electrical current.  This constant buzz that methodically and unendingly simply buzzes.  You feel it throughout the entirety of your being.  If the average person felt it for a moment, they would simply say to put on a pair of shoes and go to the gym to run off the excess energy, not understanding the perfection of its cruelty.  It is not always boisterous, though in the swells it takes your breath away.  It feels even manageable at times, but in reality, once combined with an already flawed consciousness, it gnaws slowly at the soul till you’ld do anything to remedy this monstrosity.  

On a hungover Sunday in the medicine closet, I finally found my remedy.  It was not death in the traditional sense, like suicide.  This was much slower and frankly more enjoyable.  So enjoyable in fact that people especially throughout the beginning of this century have done as I did and performed unspeakable and terrible things, things that tear apart the soul, to keep a steady supply.  My remedy at first came in a small bottle and was watered down with acetaminophen.  But over time I found a concentrated dose that matched my guilt.  And what a remedy it seemed to be. It was called Oxymorphone.  Pure, unadulterated, pharmaceutical grade heroin.  The anxiety died in its tracks, but the problem is that some cures cause more sickness than the disease itself. 

It's easy to pass a person on the street, covered in their own filth and dozing off into the whites of their eyes and ponder a common and expected thought, “How could they have made the decisions to put them where they are now? How could they choose this?”  

To a degree, decisions we make as human beings come down to chemical reactions.  If we are hungry - chemical response in the brain.  If we are tired - chemical.  Reproduce - chemical. In a good mood - chemical, bad mood - chemical.  Our brain prioritises our needs based on chemical responses.  In an addicts brain, a few unusual things happen.  When the average person takes an opiate or drinks alcohol, they will experience a chemical reaction just like everything else.  When an addict ingests one of these they will often experience a much higher dopamine or serotonin release than the average person.  The brain over a short period of time will prioritize this chemical release over everything.  Over all the things that we are normally programmed to desire.  I will never forget that day that I was hung over, feeling shame, anxiety and deep regret.  The unending buzz swelled inside me.  I felt like I would never be able to catch enough breath to survive.  I went searching for anything that could take me out of that tsunami of shame and fear.  And when I found it and the chemical reaction took place in me, I felt something I have never felt before.  Peace.  Granted, it was false and manufactured, much different than contentment, but in that moment, I felt as though I had finally found joy.  For the first time, I was hopeful that I could be happy.  The clouds parted, the sun sang a sweet song through the window and wrapped me in its warmth.  There I was alone and hung over on the floor having been in the middle of a shame induced anxiety attack just moments earlier. And now I was feeling as though I was tucked in safely at my grandmother's house in front of the fire the night before Christmas, giggling with my brother.  

We all know what happens next so I’ll skip the details of the years of active addiction that followed.  They started so warm and grew terribly cold.  What started as hope mutated into an all consuming search of inevitable hopelessness.  There are no amount of chemicals that heal shame.  And shame manifests itself in so many different and ingenious ways.  My shame came from childhood trauma.  From believing that I was destined for punishment.  I had come to the conclusion that I was inherently “bad”.  As a child, believing this destroyed my inner monologue and self esteem.  I overcompensated and indulged in my first addiction, attention.  I craved it, believing that if others saw me and thought good of me that maybe it could balance the scale.  Throughout the next couple decades the shame grew slow and constant.  But during my addiction it grew swift and in wild spurts that caused a need for more until one day I was in a failing marriage (thanks to me and me alone), financially insecure and had, at best, strained relationships with family and friends.  The lies had created a barrier between me and the outside world.  I looked myself in the eyes of the mirror every night and told myself how pathetic I’ld become and that no one deserved to have to endure me in their life.  Until one day it all came to a head.

My pills were in the collectors edition Princess Bride DVD case in the back seat of my car.  6 oxymorphones,  The kind you could only get from cancer patients and amputees.  The kind that could keep you high for hours no matter your tolerance,  And the kind that if my wife found, there would be no questioning if I was a mere casual user of opiates or a deep seeded junkie that was so far underground that I no longer smelled the grass above my head.   It seemed like a simple transfer.  I would take the DVD case from my car and walk upstairs to the bathroom, unscrew the top of my deodorant canister, wrap them in toilet paper so they didn’t rattle and re-screw the top.  To this day, I have a hard time understanding how the thing that I had changed my entire life's routine to hide had now come so easily to light. As I walked upstairs my wife asked me why I had The Princess Bride in the back seat of my car.  She grabbed it out of my hand and the pills spilled out onto the floor.  That moment, I knew there was no hiding anymore.  Over the next few hours, she and I balled as I told her that it had been four years since I was sober.  I told her I knew our marriage was over.  She went upstairs and I didn’t see her again that day but heard her crying herself to sleep as I shook violent and sweaty from the withdrawals that ensued.  That night the shame became the most powerful it had ever been. 

 Until the next morning.  I woke up still shaking to my wife sitting beside me on her laptop.  She calmly looked at me and said, “You’re my best friend.  I love you and you need help.”  She already had the best rehabilitation center in the state picked out.  And the shame shrunk just a little.  We briefly met with my brother and then she dropped me off at Cumberland Heights.  

Over the next month there, I came to understand a lot about addiction, but mostly importantly about myself.  About what trauma does.  About what secrets do. And about the power of shame.  I was by no means “cured” when I left rehab.  That’s just not how it works.  I still look at the addict on the street and while the average person pitties them, I’m instantly jealous.  I can’t help but wish I was the one that was high and feel the temporary elation that they’re experiencing.  That may never change.  But what brought me to where I am today, 5 years off opiates, is compassion, love and healing.  The compassion came from all of those friends and family who had the guts to sit down with me after all the lying and tell me how I had hurt them.  There’s a purity and finality in releasing that anger.  The love came from them still being willing to explore forgiveness and having the bravery to keep me in their lives.  And the healing still comes today through therapy, through hard work on myself and most importantly through honesty.  Taking those secrets out of the dark, exposing shame to the light of trusting someone else continues to make me whole.

I thought it was ridiculous when I heard someone say in rehab that “relapse is a part of recovery”.  It made no sense to me.  My wife however, ingested every book, video and meeting she could to try and understand my addiction.  One day she told me in the car that she learned that over 97% of addicts relapse after rehab.  While this scared me, she didn’t seem phased.  She grabbed my hand and looked me in the eyes and said, “I know the statistics and if you use again but choose to be honest with me, I’ll choose to show compassion rather than anger.”  

I wish I could say that was enough and I never used again.  But honestly I wouldn’t have healed nearly as much if that was the case.  The first time I used after rehab it took me a week to tell her.  She was undoubtedly sad.  She cried a few tears and then told me thank you for telling her.  The next time I used I told her the next day.  This time she didn’t cry.  She looked at me again and said, “thank you for telling me.  I hate that you were hurting enough to feel like you were alone and had to use”.  The next time I held pills in my hand I thought of her.  I wasn’t alone.  I could share my shame and come out cleaner on the other side.  I flushed the pills and haven’t touched one since.  

I could go on forever about all the instances where people showed me this compassion and love and it brought about healing.  But keep in mind that I am incomparably fortunate for the people I have in my life. For my family.  For my friends who are like family to me.  For the financial resources to even go to rehab or therapy.  That person on the street nodding into their lap may not.  That person acting out for attention both positive and negative may not  have received any at a point in their life that they desperately needed it.  That person making a ridiculously long internet post (me) may just need to get it out.  Sometimes it makes these people annoyingly hard to love.  They may even fight it because they don’t think they want it or deserve it.  Or maybe they’ve never received much of it and it makes them sceptical and reluctant.  But I assure you, with time and consistency, it will make an impact.

 I keep a folder with five notes in it that I can access in my phone at all times.  It contains letters from my mom, my dad and my wife, a text my brother sent me that I screenshotted, and a message my uncle posted to facebook about what my deceased grandfather would have thought about my sobriety.  Anytime I feel like I’m on the verge of diving into shame, or am overwhelmed by anxiety and often when I’m convinced that only a chemical can heal my condition, I read these.  And for the last five years compassion and love has won out over shame and anxiety.  

It’s not always easy to love, especially someone who has betrayed your trust over and over and tests your ability to forgive.  But you never know when something you do or say is permanently filed as someone's reason for why they feel worthy of it and it changes them forever.",108,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9642443060874939}"

I also am aware that some people would say that it is not wise to count the days because if you slip or relapse, you will then feel as if all the time clean/sober was wasted and then binge (the ""*abstinence violation effect*""). 

I have a serious addiction to nicotine, and I struggled for years to stop using for even a week. I finally made it 3 days a couple of years ago before relapsing, and then made it 7 days after trying again. In October 2019, I was able to stop using nicotine and made it through early January 2020 before relapsing (I counted around 64 days clean). I spent most of 2020 trying to quit again and made it 1 days in June before relapsing yet again. During the 64- and 12-day streaks I noticed benefits from being sober that have encouraged me to stay clean, and on August 20th, 2020 I stopped using nicotine and ruminated constantly on a desire to ""get back to my 64-day streak"" and I finally made it! I made it to 64 days....I made it to 65 days..... I made it to 85 days, so close to 3 months, but then I got drunk after work one night, and was depressed, exhausted, and hungover the next morning....... I began craving some cannabis and smoked some cannabis, then the craving for nicotine hit. Bam! Just like that, 85 days of being clean and having lower anxiety went to waste.

Now I am quitting again and am on day 2, but I feel trapped. I don't know how to put it into words, but I am hoping maybe somebody else who is familiar with this feeling can help me describe it and sympathize. I am not one to break a record, so it is not a vanity project. It's not like ""Oh, I have to beat my record to get a prize."" Of course not, but it's a sense of wanting to get back so badly to the 85 days or even 64 days, and only being on day 2 that has me feeling trapped, hopeless, and generally down as I go through withdrawal again. Mind you, I am also simultaneously breaking an addiction to caffeine and have gone cold turkey off coffee, tea, and energy drinks.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9817752838134766}"

I've lost many friends and respect due to this. 

I've tried venting on Facebook, but I always just get scoffed every single time. 

As people won't take a serious Cannabis addiction seriously, and just mock/ridicule me, which is often quite humiliating. 

Many people have even had to delete me due to the constant complaints of not being able to afford my annoying drug habit, and say that I am just annoying. 

I take full responsibility for/admit/own-up to having an Addiction to Cannabis. 

No one, gives, a fuck, about my drug problem. 

In 2012, I could have been experiencing the worst withdrawals imaginable, no one gave a fuck. 

And they could give less of a fuck about me... 

I could be experiencing the absolute worst cannabis withdrawals imaginable, They can't see nor feel them.  

My parents who don't smoke weed, absolutely will not be able to relate what it's like withdrawing from pot, while my older sibling, who smoked it regularly as an 18/19-year-old, can relate understand better of what it would be like. 

There are times I could smoke 3.5g within 24 hours, and I would feel ""not high enough"". 

Other times, I could take one toke, and feel ""too high"". 

Right now, I'm seriously debating just to say screw it, and try going as long as I can without relapsing? 

Regardless of whether it's a day, or a year before a relapse, I'd hate to go back to all day everyday again after working all that time. 

I've been lying in my bed for 24 f****** hours straight, no motivation, feeling sorry for myself, wishing I had money. 

If I had money, I would buy alcohol and weed.

The amount of money most drug addicts spend is usually about three or four hundred dollars to support a days fix. I have to somehow make $10 dollars (40 minutes worth of work) last over two full days. 

A $5 pack of cold shots and a .5 nug would be so nice right about now. 

What I usually do when I don't have weed, is drink Alcohol, and when I drink Alcohol, I greatly enjoy my time/duration away from cannabis. 

It's when I'm completely broke ($0.00), and can't afford either/or substance when it's an extremely annoying problem. 

I have coffee as the third alternative, but I end up drinking two litre full pots of espresso ground beans.

Am I overreacting?,"I've been supporting my best friend, K, through a difficult time in her life. We've been friends for over 5 years and we've become particularly close in the last year. Today she texted me about what was going on and mentioned casually that she'd taken one of the benzos prescribed to her husband. I was concerned because K drinks a bottle of wine pretty much every day (which already concerns me but I suspend judgment), and I texted her ""don't drink with that,"" because I know the combination can be deadly. She's very petite, like 5 feet tall and just over 100 lbs, so I don't think it would take that much for it to become dangerous for her.

Later on she called me, was telling me about the personal problem, and then went ""hang on, let me get a glass of wine."" So I went ""whoa, whoa, whoa, so you *are* mixing benzos and alcohol?"" and she said ""Yeah, it's fine, I've done it a few times."" Which was news to me. Because she mentioned to me a few months ago that she's considered taking them but was afraid to get addicted.

I told her, ""If that's what you're doing, I can't even talk to you right now, because that scares the shit out of me."" And she just said, ""okay, we don't have to talk."" So I said ""talk to you later"" and hung up. About an hour later, after a lot of private tears, I texted her ""Just want to say I love you. I'll catch up with you tomorrow.""

I have no experience with this. I've purposely avoided getting close to people who use drugs in this way because I have severe abandonment issues. I already dealt with the death of a friend who committed suicide, who wasn't even that close to me, and it's still affecting me four years later. K is my person. We have always trusted each other completely and told each other everything. I'm not close to my own mom, so being older than me, she's become kind of a surrogate. We've been talking about moving to a different country together and living in the same house. So this is a huge shock to my trust.

Am I overreacting about how dangerous this is? Because I want to tell her, as calmly as possible, that I love her no matter what but this scares me. I don't know what the right thing to say or do is. I care more about her not dying than her not being mad at me. I want to call her tomorrow and not accuse or be angry but just tell her I don't know the right thing to do or say, that I'm just concerned about losing her. I have a habit of letting people gaslight me and gaslighting myself into thinking I'm taking things too seriously. She's currently sending me pretty manipulative, totally uncharacteristic texts about how I don't want to talk to her and she can't believe I'm so upset.

2020-12-14 14:00:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/kd3x9c/tracking_my_gaming_habbit_responsible_gaming/,Tracking my gaming habbit / Responsible gaming,"Hello,

I came across this subreddit in search of a way to track my gaming time. This might not even the correct place for this so please tell me if I should look somewhere else for what I'm looking for. tldr at the bottom.

Anyway, I recently noticed that my time spending in video games is not healthy. Not in the way that I do not get stuff done at all, but I guess 40 hours a week spent inside a video game is too much. A little pretext to this and about me so it should be easier to get a grasp on my situation.

I've been a gamer for all my life I would say. I grew up with lots and lots of time playing video games and watching TV. It's now that I'm in my thirties that I start to realize that this had an effect on me early on. Like I didn't pay attention in school, only did the homework that really interested me and did (and probably do) a lot of things only half-heartedly. You get the idea, I even ditched social events to play video games.

Last year I made a turnaround after me and my ex-girlfriend broke up after 8 years. I was completely shattered (and I guess I blame myself for some things, including my gaming habbit), but after a few weeks abstaining from gaming I found joy in other things. In the outside world. I even met a lovely woman I am happy to call my girlfried for almost a year and a half now. We almost only see each other on the weekends (I don't and can't play in that time) so I am free to spend my time on weekdays for whatever I like. I changed some things like I found some new hobbies and do other things than gaming. I have a lot of plans like learning new instruments, recording and so many other things. After half a year into the relationship I rediscovered gaming for me. Slowly but steadily I spent more time gaming. Not in the way of canceling events so I can play, but enough so that I'm starting to realize that I don't reach my goals because I get trapped in games like Factorio for hours. Sometimes its 2-3, sometimes it's a whole day. I again start to do only the things I have to and think about the next time I can play. Home office since March doesn't help me in that way that my private PC is located right next to my work laptop. To tell a number: in the past 2-3 months I played for roughly 40 hours a week.

What I have come up with is the idea to track my gaming time so that I can see how much I play. I've spent some time googling if there is some kind of spreadsheet or tool where I can enter the times and it generates a sum. I was thinking of 10 hours a week should be fine  and that I can get extra time for completed tasks like household chores, learning a new song or exercising. Example: did the dishes and cleaned the kitchen: 15 minutes extra or so. 

Do you know of anything like that? My excel skills are not good enough to create this by myself.

tldr: I game too much and I would like to track my times so I can see when I play too much but I don't wanna quit it completely",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998906135559082}"

**I did it.** 

I almost can't even believe it, but I actually did it. I wasn't going to share this because i was scared to be judged but fuck that. 2 years ago I was dying, an IV heroin and Benzo addict on the streets. its okay to be vulnerable.

I woke up this morning watching my daughter smile, turning 10 months old, knowing she never has to see her dad high, scared to death knowing if I ever relapse I could change this little girls life forever. I looked in the mirror turning 28 years old, happy. Something I never thought I'd be. I'm proud of myself today. I believe in myself, my daughter has her daddy, the mother of my daughter has her person back. But what if I can’t do it, I have those thoughts.

Drugs are fun. Drugs are a good time. But drugs don't love you, your family and friends do. If you think you need help, start with the asking. Don't let it take over your life. Don't let it kill you. You're not a junkie or a failure. You're just another person with a vice to deal with the shit life throws at us. I hope anyone’s stories maybe or advice can help, thank you in advance.

Just talked to someone on the phone today struggling... she was worried about the cost, but I told her I ended up losing everything anyways after waiting too long. I went to detox 6 times from 2017-2018, finally stuck Jan.10,2019.
2 HOBBY. I started a hobby as soon as I got out of detox, even tho I felt like crap. I just knew I had to do it different and take up time. I started drawing tarot cards and studying the tarot system. I also wrote little journal entries, started to cook again and look up recipes, and go to thrift stores and started an eBay. Now my eBay is generating some real income!
3. Community. Be around other people in recovery. I wasn’t in to AA at first but it truly helps so much to just listen to other peoples stories. We are all the same. And it helps with the “guilt and shame.” I was scared of losing friends when I got sober, but honestly so many of them just naturally faded away without me consciously making some choice, and the ones on my same path are still here. I catch AA Meetings every once in a while when I get that “feeling” and am in outpatient program where I do Zoom meetings. Zoom meetings are great, you don’t even have to leave your house!!!
4. VISION BOARD. I wrote out my dreams. I went from wanting to die every day, losing everything, to considering that it could be possible to do anything because at rock bottom, the beautiful thing is that there is nowhere to go but up! So you may as well consider all your options. I have checked off all the things I put in my vision board during my first year- having a garden, taking a road trip, filing for bankruptcy, getting an eBay going, and a couple others. I have it hung next to my mirror- you have to know where you’re going to get there.
5. Suboxone. Yeah, I take it, almost two years in. I know there differing opinions, but after 6 times going back out after detox, I tried it. Just full disclosure, my DOC was heroin and I would also do anything else around at that point. It’s a medical disease, so i am not letting anyone make me feel bad about treating it with medication. I don’t want to be in it forever, but it helped me in 3 critical areas- my physical addiction to heroin, the depression I have dealt with since I was 20 (33 now), and panic attacks. I have gone down in dose, but during pandemic I’ve gone back up to full dose. I’m not stressing it- I’ll get off when I can, day by day. These two years have been the best years I’ve had in 20 years so I am not arguing my results!
6. Physical health. I didn’t move much the first 6 months I got sober, I was just a wreck. And that’s okay, I had a lot to wrap my mind around. Idk why it’s so hard to get moving sometimes but when I walk or do some yoga off a YouTube video I feel sooooo much better!!! Really, this goes in to my last point...
7. LOVE YA SELF! Dude, we are all guilty and ashamed, I mean what have we not done as addicts. Each one of us has a worse story than the next. But when you are giving it your full effort to get sober and move on, forgive yourself and love yourself! I take time for baths now, it took me a year and a half but I have a skincare routine now (yes, she washes her face now lol), I paint just for the sake of painting (we are all artists!!!) and because it feels good to look at colors and just play. Nobody is perfect, nobody better than anyone else... so see your value, and never forget it. I am aware of my past, but as long as I’m doing the best I can in the day I’m in, it’s okay to show yourself all the love and others too. We all deserve peace!

Not even sure what I’m posting for but just had to get this out.,"I am in a viscous cycle of self destructive behavior. In my mind and heart I know I’m a carry generous empathetic and loyal person but unfortunately my actions have not reflected that. It’s as if I no longer have control. I want to get back to god and know that that would be my biggest and really only weapon in overcoming all the negative evil that surrounds me but I feel a very strong presence of really negative energy that always seems to justify, defend, and encourage the actions that the person I truly am/ or was that would normally reject that behavior. There is a lot more to this and many others who are affected and that is who I’m truly worried about here. I don’t hate myself or anything like that. I don’t have a low self esteem issues. Like any other person of course I have little things that I would like to change or wish was different but not enough to wear I would ever actually go to those lengths for. However, I will add that since engaging in this destructive behavior for a couple years it’s those things that I might feel a little insecure about that I actually have noticed I’ve actually have been obsessing about them. In a normal state of mind I’m not all that concerned and shouldn’t be but as soon as I enter the darkness then I lose or am willing to push out/ away most of my moral compass. I seem to justify it by selling myself that it’s justified because of how others have treated me or because of their actions am I doing this. Which is partly true but mostly not. It’s me that has chose to do this. But why? I like to think that I’m a smart god fearing strong person but I swear that it seems that the smarter and closer you try to be with god the more and more this darkness wraps its tentacles around you. I’m so tired. Imaging being literally entangled by a giant squid with its eight arms but feel like a thousand with millions of suckers all slowly sucking the life and willingness to fight back out of you for over three years only having brief moments to get above water for seconds gasping for air just to continue and prolong the ongoing torture. You are in a state of awareness yet at the same time you are in dream state. Your dream state you are still the original you with strength power and resilience but in reality you are barely holding on. The only reason you go up for air is because of those you love and care about. I can see my weapon and it’s within arms reach but barely and every time I get my fingertips on it it’s pushed away by sometimes even myself! I can’t seem to gain enough real strength to properly defend myself. Or at least that is what I’ve now accepted to be true. The only thing I hope for or have faith in is that god feels the same way about the old me that he would still be willing to shoot an arrow in to the beast or sends an angel that cuts through the relentless and tormenting tentacles of this evil.

drugs rules everything around me. it affects my mood, how i interact with others, what i do with my free time, my budget, my health, my relationships and friendships, EVERYTHING. i try so much to plan my day according to how i want my life to be, but it always ends up being the substances that i am on deciding how my day will be instead. sober or not, i think about using from the moment i wake up to the moment i fall asleep.

should i repress these thoughts instead? keep it to myself? would it make it go away eventually? would i end up not constantly thinking about it? at the same time, i feel like it is taking some weight off my shoulder. because it is so, so, sooo heavy. it is unbearable. of course it does come along with its side of nasty comments and judgements, too. but mostly, i feel like i am annoying to other people. i wish i had something else interesting to bring into conversations.

I knew I was free.,"Over the past two and a half years, I have relapsed and quit using on a number of occasions. This last time around tho, things got worse than they’d ever been. I was shooting heroin and smoking meth all day. I even injected meth a couple of times. A long-time friend was getting high with me at home one day. The next day he overdosed and died. I started using so hard. I honestly got to a place where I didn’t want to live anymore. I couldn’t even get high. It felt like my only options were be miserable, be miserable on drugs, or die. And I was getting pretty impatient with being miserable.

Last week of October, a dear friend sends me a message saying she had a dream she was giving me a big hug and wanted me to know she loves me. In that moment, I realized I had another option. I could be happy with the people I love. If I could tell my friend who died one single thing, it’s that I love him and I realized if he could tell me something, it’d be the same thing. I decided that day that I didn’t want to die.

I knew if I kept using I’d die, and that thought terrified me. I found myself suddenly willing to do literally whatever it took to get off drugs. 12 step meetings? Sure. Treatment? If that’s what it takes. Medication? Counseling? Anything and everything. There was no more resistance.

It’s been about 45 days and I’ll still do whatever I have to to stay off drugs. Hell, I’ll do more than I have to. I want as far away from a relapse as I can get. It’s a choice between life and death.

The interesting thing is that, even a couple days after I quit using this time, I knew it was different from the time before. I knew I was gonna make it. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still scared I won’t and I am doing everything I can to keep this up, but I know that if I continue to do whatever it takes, I’m gonna be okay.",65,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9885708689689636}"

Not sure what to do next.,"I've used drugs recreationally for a really long time and always had quite a good hold over it. Other than a couple of phases where I would do it every weekend for a couple of weeks, I generally didn't over indulge and never felt like I had to have it. Things have changed over the past two months. I keep telling myself it isn't a problem because I only use at the weekends but its now getting to the point where I'm white knuckling it through the week, desperate to get to Friday so I can use. The main problem has been with ketamine, I absolutely love it and this weekend I waited for an hour in the cold for a dealer that never showed up and nearly had a panic attack because I couldn't deal with the thought of not having it for a weekend. When I can't get ketamine, it's cocaine which I have really awful comedowns from but can't stop myself from doing. A lot of the time I'll just take whatever I can get my hands on.

I also have a lot of mental health problems and I'm on a lot of psychiatric drugs, including benzos that I can't sleep without. Benzos get me through the week then ket and coke gets me through the weekend. It's been a solid two months, probably longer, of using every weekend and feeling like I can't function if I don't. I'm starting to find myself really, really craving it and think this might be becoming a bit of a problem.

New account  for this.   I need help.   My adult son is displaying symptoms of abuse.   He says it's exhaustion and I've wondered if it was a combination of that and low blood sugar.  He does work two jobs but usually sleeps when he is home.   Two weeks ago he left to go to a friend's house in the middle of the night.   He didn't come home.  The details.are sketchy but he wrecked his car and was charged with a DUI.   He says he was only smoking weed that day.  He can't remember anything about the night.   He came in that day and appeared drunk but we know for a fact he doesn't drink and never will for other reasons.    He has a court date set and they did take his blood.   Last night hadn't come in from work yet.  I found him sitting in the driveway passed out.   I pounded on the the glass trying to see him and see if he was breathing.   It took 5 minutes to get him to open his eyes a little.   He couldn't unlock the door.  He was just stuck in the car. I finally got it open and found the car still in drive which is why the door wouldn't open.   He could barely talk, he couldn't walk without falling down, I helped him in the house and up stairs.    He went into the bathroom and when he came out I asked him what he was on.   He went into a violent rage, screaming, and throwing things.  Breaking things.    Saying he was not on anything. Using abusive language, toward me and his mother.  I diffused the situation and helped  him in to bed. He snored within 2 seconds of his head hitting the pillow.  

Today he woke up and I confronted him again and showed him video of last night.   He didn't remember any of it and then again had another violent outburst.   He's much bigger than us and could hurt us bad in these situations.   I again diffused the situation and he had a long cry and was calm again.   Still denying an drug use other than marijuana.  He went to lay back down and then got up and was searching for something for a while.  In the car, in the house, in the yard.   He said he had a big case.  I told him I haven't seen it and then he cried for a while and fell asleep.   I don't know what to do.  Confronting him turns violent.  I love my son and just want him to be ok.

Allow me to explain. First, the porn. I've been masturbating since I was, I don't know, 10? For a while now I've wanted to stop masturbating, for religious reasons and just normal reasons. I've tried time and time again, and I used to be able to stop for a few days and just do it once or twice a week, but I think it's gotten a bit out of hand seeing as I can't even go a day without it anymore.

The reason I think I masturbate is because it feels good (obviously) but also I just have nothing better to do. Most of the time when I masturbate, it's when I'm alone in my room and have nothing to do or play. With coronavirus, this got a lot easier as we all lost thing to do outside of sitting in our rooms and doing nothing, especially in my area. I just need some advice on how to quit doing it.

Now with video games. I've been watching people play video games since I was 5, and I've been playing video games since I was 7. Ever since then, I've gotten more and more into games and computers. Everyday I wake up, brush my teeth, game for a long time, almost the whole day, do my classes, and sleep. It's become a routine and it's starting to affect my grades, it's scary. It's even worse now because we're inside 24/7 and it's the only thing to do. Gaming is the only ""hobby"" I've really had, and the only thing I've really enjoyed. It's not to an extent where I can't go on vacation or hang out with family without a phone or games on hand, because I definitely can, but I just think the amount I spend on my computer AND on video games is very unhealthy. It being the only thing I've enjoyed really, and having all this time since coronavirus, AND having nothing to do on the side? It's not good. And I've tried to look for hobbies as well. I tried origami, and didn't like it. Reading isn't my thing, because I always have my computer with something 'better' to do on it. I've tried starting an exercise regime many times now, and many time's I've failed. I would gladly help my dad around the house with work or anything, but there really isn't much exciting things to do other than be on my computer. It's bad, and it's been bad for years now, and I finally want to stop it, or at least cut it down.

Sounds great right? If you're going to do drugs why not do them with someone you enjoy spending time with and love, A partner in crime to get high with. That is only how it begins. Eventually both of you start spiraling down and are using more and more and you're watching the life drain from some you love so much it hurts... while you yourself are dying. 

So sure, you might suggest not helping them get drugs. It is not am easy task to accomplish. Not only do you feel hypocritical because you are getting high while trying to keep them sober. Watching them throw up and shake and cry in pain going through withdraw because they're check didn't clear when expected. Do you supply them with money for something you know is killing them or keep it to further kill yourself? You're constantly conflicted with yourself and never know what decisions to make to keep everyone happy and safe. It is not a good or fun experience. Saying no to them when they cry and beg you for money but you don't want to help them get high and you need it for your own addiction makes you feel like a horrible person. It makes is look like horrible people. We are not.

Always remember that drug addicts are not cruel, selfish, or unlovable. It is an illness that is extremely difficult to recover from. We know our choices are wrong but we are not in control, the drugs are. We all want the best for everyone and look out for each other while we're high so the best solution in my opinion to help another addict while you're an addict yourself, let it motivate you to become a role model. Some one they can look at and see that a happy SOBER lifestyle is possible and very rewarding. If we can look out for each other through our illness, we can certainly support each other through recovery and I truly believe it will be one of the best feelings I'll ever feel.

I left home at the age of 17 in 2013. My father molested me for five years and it started escalating. The reason why I stayed is for two reasons: One - I finally had a family that was together. Two- A few years in my little sister was born. 
I would go to Missouri for breaks to visit my grandmother. I ended up meeting my husband.
In 2014 I was in a car accident. A teenager was texting and driving and wasn't paying attention. I was at a dead stop and she hit me going forty-five. She made my car move 30 feet.
That broke a piece of my spine and made my degenerative disc disease progress and start much sooner than it should have.
Soon after I became addicted to pain pills. From 2014-2018 I became the monster I was walking with.

I stole from people I loved.. my family. 
I became very good at getting what I wanted all I had to do was say the right thing. 

Here's the worst part.. I was sober for a few months before my wedding day. On my wedding day... I should have said no..  My biological mother fed me painkillers all day.
The day after my wedding day..I was in the next town over searching for pills with the money we had gotten from our families.

 I ended up downing 10 Roxie's and 10 Xanax. Death seemed easier than realizing the person I had become.. death seemed easier than coming to terms with everything and telling people what I had done.

Her issues with substances have been around long before we started dating, but together during lockdown we both developed a dependence and bad habit of using ketamine. Since March we’ve used every week and that escalated to 4+ times a week.  

We tried to cutback but weren’t able to so she decided to enter in to this program. I fully support her decision and I also want to cut back my usage and plan to stay off ketamine while she’s in the program. But last night I found myself in a difficult situation where I was around ketamine and I told my partner because we’ve always been honest about our usage. But she got really upset and triggered and I get why. It was the first day of her program and this particular friend also uses ketamine recklessly. 

I say all this because I am worried about working through this addiction separately and together.

I’d like to start by saying that I understand that in terms of addictiveness, marijuana is quite low on the list. However, I do believe I’ve developed a psychological addiction/dependency

I’m spending far too much money on it and the product isn’t that great anymore. I’m on day 3 of no weed, day 2 with no tobacco, and after what feels like a lifetime of smoking enough weed before I go to sleep, I cannot get sleep for the life of me. 

Have any of you guys encountered this and do you have any tips on how to get a good nights sleep after heavy smoking periods? I understand that this is probably one of those things that will get worse before they get better, but I’d really appreciate any input to stop myself going mad.

I have been noticing drastic changes in his personality and just over all mental health. Resulting in -VERY short temper, -severe self motivated aggression (mostly verbal and sometimes threats of physical abuse), - narcissism -lack of empathy -unpleasant/toxic person to be around

by all means he wasn't a happy go lucky type of person before usage but I have noticed a huge increase in personality/side effects listed above since covid-19 lockdown

I have reached out to him on several occasions about his usage and how it is affecting his personality/behavior and our relationship.

I am losing hope and feel as if he going on a downward spiral, completely oblivious and in denial about his addiction....

I'm sure a few people have dealt with similar situations personally or know of someone like this. how should I go about this? should I step aside and let him face the consequences or step in and set up and intervention?(which I assume will end up potentially violent with me being punched in the face/end of our relationship)

## Quit

*Why don't you quit it?*  
The question lands, is considered, then discarded without investigation. Cold air invades through the window, casual in advance. The chill is felt but tolerated.Cross legged perched on the bed, posture dipping as the cheap mattress gives way to the weight. The sounds of city suburbs contest the cool melancholic tones emanating from the buzzing speakers. Grey walls bounce the warm light, tuned to counter the winter gloom that seems to bleed from all, but not before dragging the photons down to their level of imposing neutrality. When ones house feels like a prison, that is when one is truly trap-  
*Quit waxing philisophical, so pretentious. We are trying to figure this out.*  
Always so demanding, so critical, why can't it just relax?, mellow out?, take a breath?   
*Reason is that you're neglecting who you are, what you want to be!*  
Oh fuck it man, here we go again.  
*You dream big, you want it all. Hey, what if you were a writer? Banging around the world writing bullshit? Or, what if you, by some miracle, get your PhD funding,then you can sink deep into that and forget all this shit. Toolboxing.*  
Yeah, all too aware. Coffee depleted. *Woe*. I sigh at the ceiling. Craving remains. Wouldn't be satiated until my heart beat so fast it popped. Honestly though its the taste, the experience. Honest. Weight of the iron teapot tactile ecstasy, like most things physical its the nuances that make it. Feeling the force of the flow through the hands, brain controller expertly countering with slight muscle engagement, eyes confirming the steady laminar stream protruding from the spout. Phenols tempt like olfactory sirens.  
*This is so you, we're trying to sort this out, not distract. You seem so intent on ignoring reality.*  
It is right. Currently, reality is a black hole of hope. When faced with that reality, the easiest thing to do is adopt a hibernation approach. Take the lesson of the bear, settle in and wait out the weather. Existentialist, but a realist. The universe does not conspire, it does not scheme to do one wrong, it oscillates. Random fluctuations dance across the fabric of reality, interfering with one another to create deep troughs and large spikes. Neither are stable, but the dips always seem eternal in the moment, peaks feel forever fleeting.  
*One extreme to another! Circular and ill informed metaphysics gets* ***one*** *nowhere. You could be pressing into some deep maths right now, learning it for real or getting all thosewords you so desperately want to learn in. Maybe it'll stop you fumbling them like a total idio-*  
Ah, this is the true colour of it. Critique has morphed into hatred and taken new zest.  
*Its because I am frustrated. You complain and winge: 'Oh I think its fucking with my head, I should do x, y, z. They worked before...' on and on, then you sit at yourdesk in that horrid chair, fucking up your back and staring at screens pretending you're waiting for the magic to happen.*  
Truly, there is no magic. The more of reality that is learned, the further the idea of self-worth drifts. What am I but a bug to the hive? A single bacteria swimming in a sea of plasma, desperately trying to learn enough to stay relevant, stay informed, not get left behind. Maybe, I am an evolutionary dud. In the brutal and beautiful rules of nature I would be cast into the fires, obsolete. I somehow am where I am, but should I be? I think not.   
*I'm glad you're coming around to my side of things. Now you're starting to see through the haze, the real you. Lazy and obsessed with a self-image of the future. Your relationship with now is one of detest, detest for a boring journey, like sitting on a motorway.*  
Yet, all is to be experienced in qualia, subjective now. Even memories. Our minds eye dives into a time past, lost to the unfaltering crusade of Entropy increase. It wears a lense of now, a perception of a past that is itself a percieved reality.   
*You might have hit the nail on the head there mate. Your lense is awfully dark of late. You doing okay? (\\s)*  
No.  
*Want to talk about it?*  
We are.  
*I know, just snapping you back here. So the lense is dark* ***because*** *the lense is dark?*  
No. Well, yes, but thats a loop.  
*Ah, now we might have something, lets follow this path. Your subjective view of the now is warping how you see your past. Understandable. Though you see it as objective,the only possible past. For one, the past is the past. Nothing there is in your control and now is past's potential manifest. What of the future? Well you know as well as I that we inform our predictions from the past. Integrate and extrapolate. Though there is never total accuracy in this approach.*  


\-Pause. The thought hangs and is shunted back. For the moment, the debate is drowned by screaming micturition. Piss hits the sink, some call it grim, some call it economically sensible. Staples of bathrooms across the globe, mirrors bounce back the depleted, grey light. The image scowls.  


*Why do you talk to yourself in your head?*  
Ah, welcome back, even in the moments of supposed privacy I cannot find peace. Leaving the windowless box of a shower room the cold is given renewed vigor through contrast. Shivers begin to rack the body and comfort is turned to irritation and aching muscle. The heating works, though it is a syphon on the bank account.  
*So you can freeze, shiver and winge about money, but you suck £20 a week down into your lungs to feel numb?*  
At least someone can stay on topic. Its the happiness fund.  
H*appiness makes the weed, not the other way round.There is a point there, all the moments that weed has actually felt good were when the setting was right, and those moments are so infrequent now.For someone who preaches healthy drug use it sure sounds like an addiction.*  
A pull invisible to all but my desires brings me back. You talk me into it...  
*Thats not me, thats someone else, you.*  
Fine whatever, but we all come from the same origin. Its not difficult to convince me when the world is so grey. Through the haze, colours pop, notes sing, ideas flow. Why would I not want that? Its like living in a universe where everything is amplified. You're not the best company, but when the haze gets to you too, and we drift in that waking sleep, dazed by the majesty of all the small things, its beautiful.   
I *am not sure you've been fully understanding me, that stuff really is fucking your brain, I tell you even as you're sucking down the vapour. Coughing or staring blank at screens, drifting in eddies of 'conscious' thought.*  
Its fun, alright? At least, it was fun.  
*But don't you see that the fun was only amplified? Thats what it does. You've somehow got it muddled it up in this messy brain of yours. Those moments you have been happiest smokingare the moments you have been happy anyway. Currently the world is nasty, I feel it man, and weed makes it sing its dissonance louder, you gotta face it. Just be yourself.*  
Yes, what fab, cliche advice, but who am I? I don't want to be who I am right now. Critical and doubting of myself. Talking to people I love has become a mine field of self-deprecation. One misstep and the whole place goes up in a hail of shrapnel. Fumbled words embedding themselves in my neck. Looks of confusion pierce my flesh. Severing tendons, slashing arteries, bone splintering.  
*I always tell you though, you got it. 90% of the time you already know shit, the other 10% you aren't afraid to ask, do you think anyone cares?*  
Yes.   
*But why do you care if they care?*  
I care about them, I care how they see me.  
*Consider it, but don't let it rule you.*  
Though what if I was to reveal my true self, sink deep into who I am, the me that is pure? Right now, that person is somber and docile. Motivation lacking, no vigor, no fight. Sitting in an unstable orbit, slowly slipping down the curves of spacetime, no force of my own.  
This is what I have been talking about, you need to make your own gravity-  
Now who is spouting metaphysics? My own gravity? Honestly.  
*Its all relative.*  
Classic.  
*Yes, but no less true.*   
*Where is your reference? Is your reference everyone else? Some meta observer watching you from afar, judging every action you take and scoring you on a numberof well defined and scientifically proven methods. There is no universal reference frame from which all things are considered. What you see is relative, subjective qualia.*  
But I am my own meta observer. The reference frame has the same origin, it just measures different dimensions. I've somehow detached part of me. I feel so childish, insane, like I need some guidance, what I do alone seems to only resemble addiction riddled, obsession driven ignorant destruction of my self. I try hard, thinking this is the solution, something to drag me through. ""Its okay, I am young."" is the sound of someone wanting escape and saying anything to get it.  
*You've smoked some writing this, I know you have.*  
Yeah, I have, only a bit left and I want it gone.  
*Why not throw it away?*  
It was expensive.  
*The money was gone when your bought it.*  
Look, I am going to. Its going to go. Discipline is something I crave but I am awful at. We are too good  at convincing us. We know our own weak spots.  
*Who is 'we', 'us'?*  
Why harbour pretense?   
The fabled reader of this has already gotten our sudo-philosophical ""ooo look talking to a part of me"" stick. It's obvious and pretentious.  
*Who will read this?*  
Probably no one. Maybe someone.  
*Then why not keep the charade going a little longer?*  
I think we are figuring some stuff out.  
*I do too.*   
This is healthy dialogue, despite it being chaotic.  
*Hey, its a talent to make even serialised language into a chaotic, dimension hopping mess, very jazz, very you.*  
Fake.  
*Harsh, you don't really put it on to try sound cool, you actually think like this.In a way.Yes in a way, but your mind is a nebulous map, it can never truly be captured in writing, conversation-*  
I want it to be.   
*Why? Is it some kind of self-fellation?*  
Perhaps. It feels good to work through problems, I feel I might have a chance.  
*Look man, shits hard right now. You've even cast off the narrative description of the room to focus on this conversation, that speaks volumes. You have said three words today, you're lonely, living in your mental universe, misunderstood. Its okay, its what happens sometimes.*  
Its not a choice to be lonely. The worlds fucked. Everyone around me is kicking ass. They deserve it too, I never doubt them and I am proud of them all, I just wish I was there too.  
*You can be man, you just need to keep trying.*  
You think I am not trying?  
*I know you are man...*  


Seconds of silence for dramatic effect.  
*So...*  
So what?  
*Whats the conclusion of this?*  
*You always like to think the madness is fun to explore, what did you find?*  
I'm not too sure I would consider **this** fun, feels abit of a mess. I wanted to just sit and write, see how I felt. See if I could feel.  
*What stops you?*  
The question is of pure intrigue, no pretense. It sits for a little longer than before.  
*You know what it is. We've been ranting about it the last 40mins. Go back and read it.*  
Well I read it. Its very on the nose and abit odd.  
*Yeah, well, what do you want?*  
Some bits are cool.  
*I agree.*  
Hard to say that and not feel like a twat...  
*So whats the plan?*  
Finish this of-  
*Why?*  
I don't know, may aswell I guess.  
*Okay man, just do whats right.*  
Don't worry, I will.  
*Are you going to quit?*  
Yes.  
*What about special occasions?*  
I'm not sure I have the self control yet.  
*Thats a flaw you are aware of and need to respect.*  
Aye, we all have them.  
*Indeed we do.*  
I think of all the entities, you're one of my favourites.  
*Thanks! Remember that next time I come with truths.*  
I will.  
*Look dude, I need to bounce, this rant has gone on way too long and frankly its getting abit ott. Catch you around, believe in yourself, you can do it.*

I proceeded to buy two very large bottles from the store, one for work and one from home.  I would find any excuse at work to mop and would clean like a mad man at home.

What worried me the most was that today he said something about weening off being easier on the body. Apparently last time he tried to quit he had violent shakes for 6 days before giving up and drinking again.

___________________________________

From experience, please don't ever try meth. It seems so casual and is a shit ton of fun, but damn does it wreck your life.

It puts a hook in your brain that never goes away. The hook is there forever. 

By hook I mean the desire to do it, the craving the taste and pipe and experience. You can easily rationalize it as being less severe than it is.

Imagine everything dear and precious to you. Family, friends, pets, hobbies. Meth will take it away. Meth strips your emotions and empathy and you lose the emotional connections with everything. 

And every second of pleasure you get, you will pay back  to Meth after you use it.

Here's the thing that I tell everyone: If you want to meet The Devil, and lose all that is dear to you, use meth.

Advice wanted.,"This is so long and I’m sorry for that but my family needs advice as we are on the edge with some of us finally cutting off an abuser and alcoholic and some of us being codependent and wanting to leave but feeling like they can’t. 

E is in her 60s 
She is a hardcore alcoholic. 
Her mother is an alcoholic and is 92
They have both been drinking their whole lives. They don’t want to stop.

E has been divorced 3 times over it and even chosen it over her children. 

She drinks multiple of the big glass litres of tequila a day.
She is verbally, emotionally abusive and manipulative, controlling. She’s toxic. 
She  had multiple DUIs where the first time she hurt someone else minor (the knee but not badly) and the second and third time she ruined her car. She escaped jail by the skin of her teeth this time and would get people to blow into her breathalyser on the car for her to start it. She finally got it off despite actually drinking the whole time it was on and driving still. I fucking hate her for this. A drunk driver killed my grandmother. 
She still drives black out drunk. To this day. It’s worse than ever now. 

She pretended to get sober before thanksgiving because she got told off about how bad she had gotten and enough was enough.  Each time this happens she plays the victim to the drinking as if the booze has its own arms and grab her and forces her to drink it. When before she’s admitted she doesn’t wanna stop and doesn’t care.  But she knows that her partner is codependent and if she says the right thing they go into rescue mode.   I mean she drinks insane amounts of top shelf expensive stuff. Those huge glass jugs... she’s downed own before noon and kept going because she wasn’t as drunk as she wanted to be. 


Anyway, over thanksgiving she said she was sober and quit drinking cold turkey. 
Some believed her but some said there was no way because she wasn’t shaking and didn’t have withdrawal symptoms and with her drinking she would need to go to the hospital to detox because it would be dangerous.
 
A day or two later my dad caught her hiding it in the house. In the walls. 

After that she pretended to get sober again and this time We caught her black out drunk driving to get another one before her partner could make it home. He accidentally ended up behind her on the road and followed her right to the liquor store. She got out so drunk she couldn’t even walk. 

Again, the next day she claimed to be trying to stay sober when she texted a strange story of why she wasn’t home late at night. 
So a family me never came to her employers who are away on vacation to see if she was there.  She’s only supposed to be there once a week or so to do their laundry during the day.
She was there late at night with every door to their home open. The garage open. Everything open... they grab a baseball bat because they think maybe someone’s broken in.
Come inside to a empty huge glass jug of tequila and her passed out drunk on the floor.  This is a millionaires house and they just got a new security system so who knows if they saw it or know. I hope they do. They have a crazy long solid rock staircase and she could die falling down it drunk. 
 At other jobs in the past she would walk peoples dogs so drunk she would lose them and my father would have to leave his own job to go round them up and fix it. 


The next day is another sob story and she will go to AA (not stop drinking just go to AA) she’s been to rehab multiple times and it did nothing.
She just got better at hiding it and she finds a way to turn any psychology she learns around on you and your family instead of herself.


She’s gonna kill someone driving like that. She doesn’t care or feel bad at all. 

Each time she gets caught she makes a story up and pretends to be magically 100 percent sober without any withdrawals the next day and week until she’s caught again. 

Two of the family members is codependent. She provided things for them when they had nothing and now they feel like they owe it to her to stay despite being miserable. They know they are codependent and want help but don’t know where to seek it. 

She just says ok hurriedly and dismisses your feelings when you pour your heart out about it and then acts like nothing happened and keeps on keeping on. She will say “we need to look to the future and get through it together.” And or flips it around. 

She walks around blackout drunk with money, on several occasions now she’s lost it all.

First it was 500 bucks here and there

Next it was 25k that was thrown into the trash abs my father had to dig it out of the dumpster

Then 15 k was dropped on the floor from her jacket and she went the next day and got 20k more out.

She won’t spend on anything or allow anyone else to spend their own money on anything because she wants access to it for expensive booze. 
Her family is wealthy so she’s got the means to get as much as she wants. 

She will shower only at her employers “to save money” while she has 20k in her pocket and uses food stamps to buy food because she can’t bare to buy anything. Yet will spend thousands on top shelf booze. She berated a family member because they bought a blood pressure machine after learning they were in hypertension. 
She doesn’t allow them to keep their own money and takes it all. 

When she didn’t have money for booze after losing a huge wad of it in the street she stole it off her employer. 

She says “ I can’t believe these people robbed me!” Talking about the money. She says they found it and kept it and therefore it’s their fault snd they robbed her.... it’s not her fault she dropped it and left it... it’s everyone else. 

She’s already chosen to stay a drunk. She says you are not allowed to talk about her drinking or else.
She says her main rule is to never record her because she abuses and threatens and doesn’t wanna be caught.


Several of the family see what’s happening and how it’s effecting everyone and they’re gone from her life now. She’s happy to sit with her mom and get drunk and talk bad about all of us.

Her relationship with her children was mended last year by her partner. 
She got drunk and texted vile shit out of nowhere just hateful weird shit to her poor children and then they cut her off for good.
Now she says nobody else can talk to their children because it isn’t fair. 

She is majorly jealous and controlling and keeps her partner from their kids and grand babies. 
 They have to lie because she starts a fight if they’ve been with the 3 year old grandkid. That side of the family is normal so they wants them gone so they can’t call her out. 


There are two people that keep falling for her 
bull shit. They wanna go and have nothing to do with her because she’s made them actually sick with stress. They’re unhappy and miserable but they feel this sick sense of loyalty to her and they feel sorry for her when she plays the victim.
They said “are you sure she can’t change? I feel so sorry for her because she used to be a good person. There’s no chance?”

They believe her every time she pretends to be sober until they catch her and feel stupid. 
They say they feel crazy and want off the wheel but don’t know how to make themselves leave. 
She told them she would die without them. I told them she wouldn’t because she didn’t for years and years before she knew them. 

I need advice on this situation and how to talk to these family members and programs for help for codependents.

She’s gonna really do the crocodile tears and promise the world if she catches them packing. 
One of them has secured a room and plans but hasn’t left. (This one is heavily abused by her and has no self esteem left. She uses them to cash her checks from her employer in the other persons name because she makes so much but then turns around and says she’s jobless to the state to scam benefits. They didn’t know this until they recently found out because she made a joke about it and then they asked if that was seriously why. She said “if I don’t take them someone else will so what does it matter.” All the money her family has is from embezzlement and blackmail. The whole family on her side is a toxic waste pool. Now this person is afraid and said they contemplate turning her in. I told them they should. She had told them that she didn’t have a bank of her own and it was just easier initially. 

In her mind everything is hers and whatever you have should be hers too. She’s super abusive and says really evil stuff. She gaslights, manipulates, tears you down. 
 She’s truly awful. She also takes all her partners pay check money for herself and controls everything down to what they are allowed to eat and what toothpaste they’re allowed to buy . It’s gross.) 

These two family members (one is her partner ) really wants out and told me they’re afraid of the pain and they’re afraid of giving up on her if they’re meant to help her. They just don’t know what to do and said they’re looking for advice on how to make their heart catch up to their head. They said they know deep down that it’s over and they feel sick around her.
They wanna leave and not feel guilty about it. 

Just need advice. 

How do you deal with this?! I don’t want to see her drag everyone else down with her more than she has.  How can you put into words that she’s not gonna change and AA and everything else is another way to keep up doing what she’s doing just like it has been all month. Nobody means anything to her but another means to get what she wants and use them up until they have nothing left. 

I typically am a person that is pro helping addicts but this is a case of the person has no desire to change at all.
They don’t care about anyone else and have joked about how they fooled the rehab last time and how they are good at picking out enablers.


She’s been drinking hardcore since she was in her 20/30s and she’s 60 plus now.
She isn’t gonna change. She doesn’t wanna change. Nobody can save her.

I just want my family to cut ties and leave her be. They’ve done all they can. They tried to really help her and now they look like fools.
She laughed in their face and said “ it’s all mine! You don’t have a pot to piss in so you can’t go. And if you do I’ll call the cops and lie that you’re threatened to burn the house down with me in it.” 

I recorded that thankfully.  She’s toxic and she’s taking them and just crushing them to pieces. 

Some people don’t want to get better. They wanna die the way they are and that’s her. I just need to get help for codependent family so they can stop feeling guilt and get away from her.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978188276290894}"

I wanted to be that popular girl, to be liked and be in her friend circle. I noticed her and her friends talking about a game called ""ROBLOX"" and now you can probably see where this is headed.

I begged my parents to download it so I could play with her. I started playing different games such as obbies and ""Work at a Pizza Place"" It wasn't so bad at first, and I played 1 time a week. I was super happy just playing with the ""cool kids"".

&#x200B;

Then in 4th grade, I transferred elementary schools, so I stopped playing Roblox for a while. I met a very kind person named ""Ella"" who introduced me to her friend circle. Then I found out that they played Roblox too, so I continued to play.

I saw them playing things such as ""adopt me"" and ""royale high."" I was curious as I never played those games before, so I joined them. This is where bad things started to happen. You see, I was hooked when I met another friend of theirs called Rachelle. This Rachelle had everything  I dreamed of. So I admired the people with the ""halos"" and the ""big dresses.""

I got so hooked that I played in the night-time sometimes when my parents go to sleep, and then sometimes during remote classes. It wasn't until I got into 6th grade that I realized what I was doing. I had just gotten my 5th virtual halo, and I was stuck on what to do. What next? Is this virtual item really going to make me happy? This onion ring over my head? By 7th grade, I was what people considered ""rich"" in Royale High. I had every set, halo in the game. But something in me told me this wasn't the way.

She is to the point now where she cant hide her actions and it is obvious she is messed up. She has stopped taking care of day to day actives. I think she is behind on house payments. She was arrested on thanksgiving for burglary , when i asked her about it she said Bob Marley said she could have the stuff and she wasnt stealing.... This broke my heart to see her in this shape and where she is at in life. I keep trying to get her to go to rehab. She wont. Now she is facing jail time. I dont think she is doing anything about it so im trying to make sure she goes to court when needed and such. I keep telling her she needs to get off the meth. Sometimes she says ok .. sometimes she says she isnt on it. She is really messed up mentally and is a shell of her self. So what can i do? what have you done? what is the progression of this ? is this going to kill her? If she stops will i ever get her back or is damage done ? I am so lost and i dont know what to do. Legally can i do anything? Is there any options for me?",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9972398281097412}"

(job, bf, cars, family support etc.) She met a friend in an outpatient program whose drug of choice is H. He (30M) was doing good and she needed a place to live so now she lives with him. They’ve both relapsed several times but still try to work on it in their own ways. Now they’ve moved into a house together, she is still jobless, accepting unemployment. He has his same nice job and works from home every other day. 
She tells me today that he’s been using again for the past 2 days and it’s been tough. She literally just walked in on him today as he was shooting in between his toes. She’s trying to keep her distance and stay away from him today but it’s a struggle. I asked her if she could come over to my house for the day but it’s 40 minutes away, she’s a bad driver, she says she doesn’t want to leave him alone in this state, and also she drank a little last night and she’s got a breathalyzer on her car so it could still be in her system. I feel so helpless and I know I don’t have to carry this feeling and there’s nothing I can do or say to really help. I’m just so worried for her. He will likely (🤞🏼) stop using in a couple of days, until the next time. I have to take her in doses now because just seeing her name and texting with her causes me some kind of PTSD anxiety from all the chaos that’s gone on in the last 3 years. Which I feel guilty for. 
I just hate hate hate this so much and wish they would both go to rehab again or at least daily therapy. Especially her since she’s not working and still getting money. But I know it’s gotta be up to her and she’ll make moves when she’s ready. Just fucking sucks.

It’s astonishing how systematic it is. 

I’ll use my Drugs until something bad happens, or it becomes obvious. Fear of losing my job and everyone seeing through my facade will keep me clean for a week. Maybe even a month. I won’t even think about it that whole time. I will literally believe that I’ll never touch the shit again. 

It seems like the decision isn’t even being made by me, but there’s no one else wearing my shoes. I don’t even consider it most of the time. I just make the decision in an instant, then I’m on the way to the plugs house to get meth. After a month of not even thinking about using, one bad day and suddenly I NEED to feel that feeling NOW. I deserve it. Life is hard. /s 

I was going thru a rough time when I first tried it. Continuous unfortunate life events was my justification to myself. Plus, I can go a week without it. As long as I smoke meth like a gentleman that’s ok right? I’m no addict! The first two days it’s unnoticeable. hell, I’m even more outgoing. I don’t see how it’s an issue. What happened the last 32 times definitely won’t happen this time! As long as I make sure to sleep every night I’ll be good. 

       Then the third day comes. Or the fifth. This part doesn’t really matter. The point is, the day COMES.
When it comes, it brings no sympathy. I will be all alone. Nobody to talk to. Just my self pity and I. 

The chemical that brought me more joy than anybody ever could, has now become my Demise. 
  
After I successfully come down, I appreciate life so much. I’m so glad I’m sober. Thank god I made it through that binge without losing my girlfriend, job or car. Next time I won’t be so lucky, none of that was worth it. It’s not even that fun in hindsight. 

    Then I usually go through a stage of reflection with a clear mind. Since I could remember, i did nothing but hate on meth users and judge them. I would do most of the other big ones regularly. But, told myself I would never do meth. Apparently, smoking pills and H were more classy in my 19 year old head. 

   It’s crazy how I got here in such a short amount of time. I turn 21 this month and this last year has been pretty eventful. Coming to grips with being an addict after a year of denial is a strange feeling. 

   It’s different now. Every time I slip up, I’m aware. 
I’m aware that I’m betting on my soul with the devil. 
This could just be a chapter in my life. One day I could just wake up and never touch the shit again. But the odds aren’t in favor of that.  On the other hand, I could lose everything And every one I have. 

I should have already, it’s surprising that I’m still above water. This gives me no sense of confidence tho. I am young but I’m well aware that I’m playing a losing game. This revolving door of keeping my shit together just enough to justify my regular binges. 

  I’m geeking right now praying to the sky that I snap out of this. I’m tired of crying on my way to the plugs house. 

I think I’ll get it right in the next few times. I need too. 
  One thing is for certain tho..

She's been an addict for a little more than a decade now. Her thing is meth. She's been in trouble with the law over the last year, but she's been on parole for the last eight months. She's recently fallen into using again. There's a lot going on with her and I know that there's not much I can do but right now I'm the only family member she's in contact with. And I want to make sure that she knows that I'm here, that I love her, and that her family loves her.

During this most recent episode she stole a rental vehicle. And my mom received a notice from the rental car company about this car, so I at least know that she in fact took a rental car and has not returned it. She says that it was stolen, I don't think that's the truth. Anyway, she's in more legal trouble because of this obviously and I'm certain in violation of her parole.

When I talk to her I asked her if she was using and she said she was and I made sure to let her know I'm not there to judge her. I'm not telling her to stop using I have pleaded with her to come home and she has told me that she's not ready and that she can't face family and is scared of her legal consequences.

Yesterday when I talked to her I asked her about heroin, which she said she bought a few days ago, and she told me that she wasn't using heroin. But that she bought the heroin as a ""last resort."" Of course that worried me even more than I already was.

I don't know who she's staying with or where she's staying she is obviously not telling me because she is likely afraid that I will turn her in or something like that.

I know that there's not a whole lot that I can do. However, if anyone has any advice or any resources that I can take a look at so that when I do speak with her I can make sure that I'm being supportive and saying whatever the right things are. I love her I want her to be safe and I want her to come home I don't want to lose her.

Part of the reason is, every one of us was burned by addiction in heart breaking ways, and we know first hand how much of your life it takes, and, being seasoned professionals, know how to help. Our existing patients love us.

The only problem is... we're running dry. Yep, we're good doctors, but lousy marketers, and it looks like professional marketers are good at one thing - charging money with no promises, and, lo and behold, no results.

Now, back to why I'm here... Like I said, we know how to help. But, by not having been addicted ourselves, none of us can figure out how to make our clinic more widely known so that people we so desperately want to help find out about us. The only way available to us now is to write about addiction, and hope that it catches the attention of those that need help.

So, the question is - what would YOU like to know? What makes a difference in YOUR life? What can help you to make a decision to stop it and actually dial a number, submit a form or write an email - and not change your mind and give up on it five minutes later?

Right, looking for a bit of assistance. for many a year cocaine was my drug of choice, to the point, a pretty serious addiction formed.

At its worst I was taking it at work whilst out visiting clients with work, I have lost several jobs due to my erratic behaviour/ unreliability/ missing shifts etc. Over the years I have dabbled in CA and went to several meetings and also studied CBT as a method of addressing the issue.  

Now,  the thing about my relationship with coke now is I don't even enjoy taking it, yet at every single opportunity I have I'm on it. 

I spoke to a mental health counsellor a while ago and told her that of the whole process of being on it, being high and then coming down from it, I only enjoy about 5% of the whole experience, now, after the first couple of lines its simply just prolonged anxiety and severe paranoia.

My biggest trigger was having ready cash to spend, so I attempted to address this by opening a notice account, I have to provide 35 days notice for withdrawals, so that solved a part of the problem of instant gratification that comes with having ready cash and a coke habit, so far I've managed to put by some money, but I'm still spending the rest on gear, so although I'm saving, I'm leaving myself short on other things, it feels like self-sabotaging behaviour  The strange thing about this is, if the money is not there to buy it, I don't even give it a second thought, I don't care about taking it. I'm happier in life when I can't do it. It's not like I feel I'm craving it, To me, this feels like a form of self-harming, financial self-harm,  

I'm totally lost as to how to deal with this. I don't enjoy taking it, happy when I cant, but yet I'm still in this cycle., I'm destroying what could be a decent standard of living. What can i do to solve this???",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993484616279602}"

My usage is about 4-6 (10mg) hydrocodone per day.  I have been taking these daily for about 3 months and the usage started at about 2-3 per day and scaled up to where I'm at now.  I was not prescribed these, I take them recreationally. 

I am no stranger to addiction, I've battled it for years, but I manage to keep myself from getting too, too deep.  I've settled for very long bouts in the past of using Kratom and always find myself toying around with opiates.  I stay away from the real hard stuff because I have very close family who have had their lives destroyed by it.  This doesn't keep me from 'dabbling' with pills however, it is has kept me from going too far off the deep end.

Not sure why I'm providing the back story, really I just want to ask....how bad will this be?  Any advice on a taper strategy?  Or would you recommend cold turkey?  I'd like to be off of these by Christmas and I want to come up with a rock-solid plan to avoid going off the rails.  If a prolonged taper strategy is recommended I want to obtain the necessary amount and be disciplined about it.  It may be beneficial to know that I took off work the week of Christmas and in the back of my mind I sort of did this to mentally prepare to be clean by then.

I've recently stopping medication I was taking (on about day two) and I have gone through this before but I'm doing it all over again. I have had the hardest time getting through work, through the evenings and nights. Obviously that comes with withdrawal of course but does anyone have any good tips to get through the tough parts besides hiding myself at home alone missing work. 

As background, and I can explain if there are more questions, but I was at a painclinic for a couple years taking Vicoprofen and wanted to dead stop and to help curb withdrawal, I read about taking loperamide and started. It helped ease withdrawal pain but so many other complications came with it and I've found myself stuck on taking it to prevent MORE withdrawal. You can find more info on it at r/loperamide but it's mostly people asking how to abuse it which is really sad to me because I want/need to get the hell away from it. I won't go down the Kratom route because I feel like I'll trade one bad habit for another and I'm not a weed smoker. 

I also recently found out I'm pregnant and besides doing this for myself, this is the MAIN reason this needs to end once and for all. I know if I can get past the 3-5 day mark I'll be okay but I need to work and also unpack the house I've just currently purchased.

I do have 1mg tablets of Alprazolam to help with anxiety, clonidine (from when I previously tried to do this) and propranolol (from when I previously tried to do this). I also have some sleep sedatives but I haven't taken any of that since I found out I was pregnant.

I shouldn't have taken MDMA again. I have addiction issues in my family. Over 5 years ago I used MDMA semi-regularly (definitely abused it on one or two occasions). Then in the same timeframe (maybe 2 weeks after a roll?) took a heroic dose of mushrooms that led to an awful death trip and i've never really quite been the same since anxiety-wise. I was about 99% better, and now at the age of 34 decided to take 150MG and have a roll like old time's sake. It was good, the magic was back like usual.

It's been almost a week, and I still feel not great. I can focus better now, but I have this lingering anxiety over me that took so long to get over the past 5 years. I feel like I've reset everything back to square one, except at least this time I definitely won't feel like my chest is heavy with anxiety for 6 months like before - i seem to have skipped that phase.

Please tell me this is just part of the hangover. My appetite is back after 5 days, but i'm still tired-ish, accomplishing tasks is difficult and the thought of being productive is anxiety inducing. I ran a difficult 5k yesterday, but the exercise certainly helped make me feel better like usual. I'm normally very active and in good shape.

Anyways, for anyone that's had a similar experience and you're thinking about trying it again, maybe think twice. I'll definitely update again in a few weeks. Just here to give fair warning to another professional 34 year old that really needs to have their shit together for their job. Fortunately I have a bit of time off at the moment to recover.

The worst part is now having my two cups of coffee in the morning makes me feel all crazy and anxious. My mind is all over the place. I hope this all gets better soon. And for clarification, I think what started all this was probably doing too much MDMA in a short period of time, then having a very intense mushroom trip after a short break that I couldn't handle because my stress response was all screwed up from doing too much MDMA. It just changed the way my body handles stress forever.

Not to sound too grim, my life has been actually pretty sweet the past few years, I just need to get my shit back together after this and never do drugs again. haha",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9890916347503662}"

I believe I have destroyed a good amount of my dopamine receptors in the process and dont know how to deal with the damage. Meth, MDMA, adderall, cocaine whatever stimulant i could find i got my hands on. My ADHD medication doesnt even work anymore because of all of the abuse. Its been about 2 years now cycling through different stims in order to focus better and do my college work for longer. Having ADHD it was hard to begin with so you can only imagine how hard it is now that my brain has reduced its function. Im irritable, i hear things that arent there, i cant focus at all, i am constantly fatigued and am plagued by non stop anhedonia. I read that it takes about 14 months for the receptors to regenerate to almost normal working ability but even that wont undo the damage i did. I just wish i could go back in time and never take that first bump, that first pill. I feel so depressed and hopeless i want to drop out of college because what is the point anymore if my brain does not function to its full ability. I have hopes dreams and aspirations that seem so empty now. I used last night and as I did I kept thinking about how badly i need to stop. I woke up and flushed the last supply i have. Im going to block all of the people associated with substances off of my social media in hopes I wont go crawling back like I always do. I cant. I wont let myself. I cant continue hurting something that dictates the entire way I function. I feel so beyond stupid for not realizing the damage i have been doing sooner. So stupid for following in the footsteps of my addicted friends. Im embarrassed to even mention the fact that I have a problem. I genuinely dont know what to do anymore. The feelings i get without the drugs makes me only want to go back again but i cant. Does anyone have any advice? Words of encouragement?  Something to say that will slap the stupid out of me?

I am a student who consistently good grades in high school. I started (online) college classes this semester. My dream is to eventually be a digital artist as a career (whether that digital art be illustration, animation, game design... or something else I have yet to decide).

The reason I say this is because my unyielding addiction to youtube videos (and to a lesser extent, video games) is keeping me back from being the best student, artist and person possible.

I have watched youtube videos for a very long time now, and they have been so engrained on my daily routine that if I don’t go to my phone first thing in the morning I feel off the rest of the day. When I am not watching youtube videos I am thinking about them. I start my day with youtube videos and end with them. It has gotten extremely bad in the last few months especially, I used to be able to get some things done normally but lately I have trouble doing the simplest of assignments. I rarely sleep now because I stay up so late watching them, and then I try to catch up on due assignments with the rest of the night. The only time I really sleep is during the day now, making me basically nocturnal. It is getting to the point where if I don’t suck it up and get work done, I am gonna fail my classes, and well... I am not sure what I am gonna do if that happens. I always click just “one more video”.

A side effect of being basically nocturnal is I am never awake when friends or family want to meet up. I haven’t fulfilled my social needs for a long time now

I have already tried some things to stop the addiction, but nothing has helped long term. I tired uninstalling the youtube app, but now I just re-install it as soon as I uninstall it. I have tried website blockers but they always end up being hidden behind a paywall or just plain don’t work. The worst part is I NEED youtube for tutorials and guides, so I can’t really completely block it. 

So, have any of you dealt with an addiction like this? I know that it isn’t as serious as something like alcoholism or drug abuse... but it is actively ruining my life, and I need it to stop.

Long story short I met a friendly and trustworthy guy not but 3 days ago. Prior I had been desperately looking for a place for my wife and I to live(bad renters credit). Dude invites me over to chill and crack a few beers. Mentioned my situation and he immediately proposed letting my wife and I room with him. I could tell early on this fellow was lonely but I didn't make any haste assumptions or judgments, because after all he is, genuinely nice. He even offered my wife and I the master bedroom with walk in closet and bathroom. It was just me the first couple nights whilst my wife was preparing her belongings at her parents. I wont keep you waiting any longer. Dude is quite obviously a habitual, long term sex addict and is most likely the reason he is alone wanting to share his intense, devious and dark fantasies. Me feeling contractually obligated. Give ear and express interest and genuine curiosity. Whatever whatever hes bi has a 4 year old daughter he cant see, ex wife whatever. Into swinger sex getting pegged dogging out his girl. I personally cannot relate because I know monogamous, vanilla(sex) relationships are healthier for myself and others most of the time. I subtly express that belief to him and it glazed right over him. (LESS we forget I bought him a ball of meth to cover this months rent. Which is my DOC and impeding on my stuggle to stay clean). Here's where I'm annoyed, hes telling me he wants and loves to get pegged by girls wearing huge dildos. Asks if my wife would do that to him. I, visibly uncomfortable, didn't know what to say. If my place to live wasnt on the line i would put my foot down but instead I tell him that my wife wants to peg me lol (she actually does but i aint bout more than a fingernails length) he keeps pestering me about if she would do that for him. Angerly and cowardly, i finally respond with something like, ""she might idk, but probably not"" because we are LDS and faithful to each other AND THAT WAS IT. THESE LAST 2 DAYS i have been trying to make it abundantly clear that neither of us will do anything sexually with him. But he only heard what he wanted to hear apparently. Earlier today i picked up my wife and our belongings so she could properly move in. The wife and I had been apart due to external bullshit so we are eager to finally be living together. So we take a shower and have sex before she went to work. I was already uncomfortable about dude man beating it to our commotion but it wasn't too detrimental until not but 10 minutes later he sends me a pervy text basically asking if my wife could fondle him before she went to work. Currently arguing with him because what he heard is me tell him my wife would for sure do stuff like that and I'd be okay with it. WHICH I NEVER SAID hes clearly twisting my words and using the apartment as leverage. so I'm in a tough spot right now. Obviously i should have been direct and straight up from the start (WHICH I MOSTLY WAS) but now we are here.

My biggest question is how this is actually going to effect my physical health initially. Covid is becoming more prominent in my city and I'm worried that this will compromise my immune system when I start, making me more susceptible to not only getting the virus, but getting extremely sick from it. This factor paired with my lungs from vaping especially worries me.

Its pretty inspiring to browse through this sub, to read all these different stories and to see how much positivity all of you are spreading. My english is pretty limited, but I try my best to express my situation. 
I have a history of polydrugabuse(mostly cannabis,kratom in the last year,many harder drugs before that point)but it became better and better especially in the last 1,5 years. At the moment I'm able to stay clean alteast a few days, In these days I do not have the urge to consume, but the urge gets stronger the more shitty I feel. Hallucinogens every few weeks are an exception, but imo I wouldn't be able to get addicted to these. When I'm clean I become more and more depressed. There are positive days inbetween,but then I fall into a hole again. I talked to a therapist, he send me away as soon as I began to talk about my past history of drug consumption.

My active addiction lasted 15 years. I started at 15 years old, like most with alcohol and bud. Then I graduated to pills and E, then coke and Adderall. But it wasn't until around turning 22 that I decided to try crystal. The moment I did,  I felt the way it burned when sorting it, and oooh did I grow to love that feeling."" It burns so good"" was a phrase I had used many many times immediately after a day rail. It only took that one time for me, you know all those anti-meth commercials warn us about , thats all it took. 
 
I was absolutely in love. For me, it felt like I had finally found the answer to all my problems.  It was what I'd been searching for all my life. All my anxiety and insecurities completely  disappeared.  All of a sudden, I felt sexy, witty, capable of engaging with others in a way that wasn't possible before. Id found IT. It being what was missing in me all along. My whole life, I felt like I'd been lost; but with meth, I had been found. 

And so, like many others I'd come to know, my love affair with meth began. I was able to use the drug for quite a long time before I could see that in reality,  she had been using me. 
I had my first born son two years prior to my love affair with tina'. So the first 8 years of his life, I dragged him along for my dance with the devil. Something that will haunt me to my dying day, is the horror I put my children through.

My story is a long one, so if there's any interest,  I'll continue with part one.

I'm not sure how reddit works, but I'm including backstory, for context.

Also, I should note that I'm in my early 50's and my brother is late 40's. 

Ten years ago, my brother was a very successful guy.  Was a steady worker at the same facility for over 12 years, and was fast tracking to upper management.  Well into the six figure range, new 300K house, and the latest gizmos (he was always a tinkerer :) )  He wasn't in the best of marriages (terrible in fact), but he loved his wife, his kids, and was always upbeat and happy.  Sadly, he was suffering from daily migraines and tinnitus.  So he goes and gets checked out, can't find a cause or cure, so they prescribe him hydrocodone for the pain.  That was the beginning of this terrible trip.  He began to need more of those pills.  This wasn't public knowledge at the time, I only found out about it seven years ago.  His work began to suffer.  He's not so happy any more.  We (his brother and sisters) reach out, asks if there's anything we can do, tell him we love him, etc.  He attributed his state of affairs to his abusive (now) ex wife.  And we could see it.  She was a B\*\*\*\*.  I mean, horrible.  Still, he was still going through life, and seemed to get back to his normal self.  Then he lost his job due to attendance issues.  Turns out he had started supplementing with Adderall.  He and his (now) ex-wife separate (not his choice - she was a cheating SOB), and he continues to spiral.  Lost the house, can't keep a job, becomes VERY distant.  Won't answer our calls/text.  Began borrowing money from his siblings as well as mom and dad.  Never repays it.  That sort of thing.

That brings us up to 2 years ago.  Meets a girl.  Can't stop talking about her.  Telling us she's perfect.  Loves him for who he is, supports him in his decisions, great physical compatibility, etc...  Then we meet her.  It's obvious from the first minute that she's a user of something.  We don't know what, but it's there.  Still, my brother DID seem happier.  Motivated to get his S\*\*\* together, so to speak.

Well, his life didn't get better.  It's gotten so much worse.  Turns out she was a heroin addict.  Had been addicted for years.  Lost her children because of it.  And now he's living the same horrible life.   He's recently come out to us (his siblings) as being addicted to H, and in the same breath, asked us for money, which we won't send.   He's now living out of her car.  No job or other means to support himself.  We've offered to pay for the clinic, his medication, uber rides to the clinic, have food delivered from the local grocery store, whatever.  He doesn't want that.  It seems that he just wants money.  Or at least enough money for us to pay for his girlfriend as well.  Further compounding the issue, is none of us (his siblings) live close.  My dad does, and has been going to help him with his car, buying him cigarettes', things for his girlfriend.  Never gives him money, but I'm worried that's going to be coming soon.  He's a vet and he has access to free help, but he won't take it.  

There's so, so much more to this than I've put here.  I'm just at a loss.  I don't want to lose him, but I feel that I already have.

I realize that therapy will be must, but I also need some form of detox, because in my current surrounding I can't seem but to fail.

My problem is how to find and select a proper rehab. Have you ever seen John Oliver's Last Week Tonight bit about rehabs? Highly recommended to those who have not. It is very eye opening. And without getting into too many details, the main takeaway point is that the industry is ripe with abuse and facilities with bad intentions who are only interested in your money. So as a late night fan of reading through leaves, wishing I could get some of that strength displayed here, I figured who better to ask, but past addicts themselves.

So.. How did you go about finding a rehab? Do you have any recommendations or insights to share from your experience? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9639616012573242}"

Long story short, my roommates and I were in a bind and needed to fill the 3rd bedroom ASAP. We met this girl through a Disney Facebook group (we al used to work for the company) and the first time we met her and showed the room she seemed totally fine. However she did wear a mask and had stockings, a hat, and a long sleeved dress so I didn’t notice anything off. My bf did, later that night he said she seems to have lesions and he wondered if she uses meth or something. Me being ignorant and kind - I gave the benefit of the doubt and insisted she probably has psoriasis or something. 

Well fast fwd to when she moved in. And now I’m noticing a ton of signs. 
-she paid rent AFTER it was due which left us in a bind for 2 days
-she said she does not want to be formally added to our lease because she has no credit and she is 27 y/o
-she has a burner phone and not a real phone 
-her skin is covered in lesions and scabbing, and it’s on her face, and she has very red spots/acne marks, and bandages all over. 
-her hair looks brittle and unkempt 
-the other night she straight up went in and out all night and we saw it on our ring footage and it appeared that she didn’t sleep
-she randomly sits outside on the sidewalk (we live in an apartment in metropolitan Orange County, CA) to smoke and read a book and she will sit either there or in the parking garage on the floor near the garbage 
-her bf is paying for half the rent and basically living here but not living here? It’s odd because I don’t think he’s a user himself but he’s definitely a little off, always pacing around and keeping tabs on her 
-She parked in someone’s spot that was not assigned to her and her car got towed... and she yelled at her bf saying he must have moved the car and not remembered? It was a very bizarre and awkward interaction 
-she is unemployed and told us she “has other forms of income”
-she’s extremely skinny and looks sickly, her skin is kinda aged very slightly, and upon looking at old photos of her she looked WAY different. Much healthier looking a few years ago and now it’s like a totally different person.

Again, I could be over thinking it, but I just want to be sure if I should be cautious and if this is anything to be worried about? 

TL;DR: my new roommate exhibits odd behavior, doesn’t have a job, has no credit, has a burner phone, and her skin and weight and hair resembles someone who might be using meth and I’m worried about her living here",1,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993564486503601}"

Life gets rough, and we’ve both had a history with opiates specifically. I had struggled more with addiction on my part. Everything was so innocent for a while, just Percocet here and there. We were making great money, what was the harm? It was only a couple times a week. Well, then I realize my work was bought out, and leaving the county. And when our life spiraled, we leaned harder on the escape. It was our crutch, for stress, depression, anxiety. We came to an agreement to keep spending down, that we would switch to fentanyl. Though this time, he asked that I promise that I wouldn’t inject it this time. (Previous round I had, ended in a sedated detox after a horrible car accident) I thought sedated detox was the shit, but looking back, I realize I never learned my lesson, and if I had, maybe I wouldn’t have fallen back into the trap. Fast forward 2 years, and here we are both shooting it now in an attempt to make what little we can afford hit harder. (We both lost our jobs during the pandemic **Shocker we both got denied unemployment** and are having severe trouble finding reliable work, despite applying to everything from fast food to luxury dealerships like what we did before, to absolutely no f*n avail... it seems so hopeless, there’s so many people competing for the same spots, it’s horrible) Though we have gone from 25-30 pills a day, each, to 16-18 total, but the cloud over head, has NEVER changed. Chasing our tails, running Postmates to make sure we stay off sick, pawning everything we have between income. The daily stress has been so hard, my depression is at an all time low, I’ve been so close to just getting everything I can, just to give up.

First time in r/addiction so I apologize if this doesn’t fit here but I don’t know what to do. 

I have a friend who is an addict, she has a 1 year old baby. 3 months ago she went to rehab and we looked after the child for a month. Before and after she had been sneaking off without telling anybody, leaving her baby with whoever she could find and disappeared for a couple of days at a time to get high until she would call up asking for money to get back home. The baby’s dad is out the picture. 

She came out of rehab seemingly a changed person, stayed with us for a week and then went to live with her mum (baby’s grandma). It only took a week before she snuck off on a massive bender for a week and she has gone multiple times since then: Leaving her family and friends to think she was dead. Until now she has begged us not to call social services but it’s beyond our control now and not doing so would be illegal and totally unfair on the child. The last few months have been perfect conditions for her to get better but she’s not using it to work on herself. I no longer trust anything she says and feel like it’s all geared around manipulating us for when she next uses. There have been many times when she could have told me she thought she might be about to relapse (we speak most days about how we’re feeling) but she seems like she is purposefully planning the next high as opposed to failing to resist an opportunity. 

She’s been talking about suicide a lot recently but now I honestly don’t know if it’s genuine or another manipulation. Maybe both. 

Our current plan is to do everything we can to get the baby’s grandma custody of the child. I don’t think this is negotiable at this point. However the advice im looking for now is how to treat my friend (and how to advise the grandma treats her) should the grandma kick her out the house? What was it that got you to kick your habit for good? I don’t want to put the grandma through any more stress and it’s not fair on her other children but she has the threat of suicide lingering over her if she kicks out her daughter. The daughter has also stolen lots of their stuff in the past to sell for drug money.

Every website you access can see your IP address which can be tracked down to your exact coordinates.

If you want complete security/anonymity you have to use a VPN that doesn’t keep logs.

VPNs make you 99% anonymous by changing your IP address.

I have tried out a ton of them and my favorite is Nord

It has quick speeds, allows unlimited connections, is one of the cheapest, and doesn’t keep logs! Nord is based in Panama so they aren’t legally required to monitor their users or comply with any governments.

My whole life I was told to be cautious of you, and to watch my step, because you ran through my blood. You destroyed my biological family, caused me to be separated from my parents, and my brother. You still gnaw away at my biological mother’s life, who I haven’t even talked with or seen since I was three. She’s in and out of rehab programs, it doesn’t seem like the apple fell far from the tree… My biological family is broken because of you. But because of you an extra chance in life grew, I was adopted, so I guess I could give you thanks. I was raised in a loving family, one that was a stranger to the havoc you cause. They warned me about the dangers of you; I smiled, nodded, and passed it by as common sense. I was wrong to do so, I never imagined the grip you could have on me...As years went by, life began to get more and more challenging. I turned to peers, instead of the family who raised me with care, to see how I could escape from my emotional baggage. And there you were, but not as my parents had described. You told me I wouldn’t fall a slave to you, but that was just a lie. Presented like a wolf in sheep skin, you say, “Just smoke weed once a month, you are strong enough to not do anything more.” But those months turned into weeks, those weeks into days, and the days into hours. I then asked you, “Now what?” For the high that I was getting, was not giving me the same escape as before. You say, “Well...I have downers, these will relax you just like the bud...And I have uppers, to get you up out of the mud.” So I just say, “Fuck it.” Because you have helped me through so much already. You gave me the escape that I craved so terribly, I began to trust you, more than a lot of my friends. I even put you top priority over my family and all of my friends. But still you told me that you weren’t important, that’s how you stayed hidden, you told me to hold my relationships higher than you; but you knew no matter what you said it didn’t matter, for you were already the puppet master. Hell, you almost killed me, ¾ of a gram of molly and one seizure later, I thought I had learned, I told myself, “No uppers, no downers, just weed.” Back I was, to only smoking weed again, but that’s exactly where you wanted me. I was doing good for maybe a month, but then the wind blew Blow back into my life. A little while after that, I was trapped behind the bars of Benzos again. I was back to finding new substances, new ways to escape my reality. Little did you know that this would be your own demise. A few acid trips, and one DMT trip later, I could finally see you for who you really are. And maybe that’s what you want me to think, that these psychedelics helped me and that they are good for me. But no, I still see the negatives that these substances have, and I also see that no matter how “good” the substance is for me, I can almost guarantee that it will land me back in the same loop of addiction. I could see how close we had grown to one another, and along with that I could see all the people that we hurt together. No, it was not just you who caused pain and hurt in my life, it was a team effort, and in order to separate myself from you, I need to admit that. I chose to keep you close. I chose to trust you over my loving family and friends and you only made the connection between us grow. So instead of asking you “now what?” I will ask “Why?” Why is it worth it for me to follow your guidance, when I’ve seen the pain you cause. Why fight for you, if all I have ever been, is caught in between your jaws. Why risk an already broken relationship I have with my parents? One due to the fact because you taught me it was okay to lie. Why risk my career?...No answer?...Well then, I leave you here to die.",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.6980696320533752}"

She is my everything, and I say with a heavy heart that all lies and deceit was not TRULY ME.

I'm hurting, and want to just get back to the chronic use again, even thought I can justify every reason not to.

I put her through hell and back, and being the person I care more about, would like to fix what I can. She mentioned I should not be hopeful with ending back up with her again.

Earlier this year my family and I (f25) discovered my dad (m54) has developed a severe drug addiction. After almost a year of change in behaviour and constant disappearing and change in appearance. I discovered he was doing meth and had been for (at while atleast 3yrs). He is now unpredictable, jittery and aggressive. We have since tried to support him which has only resulted in my underperformance at work and dismissal, my sisters deferring her university year and my brother almost failing the last year of his mathematics degree. I don’t know how my mum is continuing to operate and work with all that we are enduring and I applaud her for it.

Anyway fast forward to now, we have made the decision to not accept him back into our home because we do not feel safe and do not want to be around someone who is making no active changes to their addiction despite claiming to.

2weeks ago he came and collected his things. Surprisingly he was calm, made a speech about how he hasn’t always been a lame dad etc (which is a lie) and how we will never see him again (another lie). We are financially in ruins from him, our lives have all been turned upside down and our mental states are in pieces.

Since collecting his things he has bombarded us with constant messages and calls, going from one extreme to the other I.e. him begging us for another chance then him wishing the worst on us. He says things like you will all get what’s coming to you and you will all regret this. Now he has decided to make me the target of his abuse and threats. He randomly comes and parks outside our building or circles it.

My mum and siblings and I have all blocked him off our phones now because the harassment became too much. He came to our home a week ago saying he had made the decision to change and we said that we were pleased and asked what plan he has to enforce this decision. He had none. I made it clear that he needs professional help and that’s the only way we are willing to help him. He refused to accept this and the chat ended up with him throwing and smashing things around, claiming this to be his house (technically not) and if we want to leave we can, my sister having a panic attack and my brother having a bloody fist from punching walls and hitting himself due to anger and being distraught. He then begged us to forgive him and left.

The next day, similar situation but him threatening to contact my in-laws (who don’t know about any of this) and me breaking down.

He has now somehow come to the conclusion that I am the reason our house is cursed. I am the reason he is ruined. I am the one who is to blame. I really don’t know what I’ve done. I’ve never brought problems to our home. I’ve graduated and managed to secure an good job (that I’ve mow lost) and got engaged in the last yr. I’m not perfect but there isn’t a single bad word that can be said of my character and accomplishments. I don’t know if it’s because I am the oldest and was the one who has taken the main responsibility to support him or vocalised our disapproval of what he is doing but I am now in the firing line of his abuse.

He has been leaving voicemails to my entire family calling me a witch and saying that I am the reason for all this misfortune.

I’m afraid to leave the house as he continues to circle it daily and I constantly check the windows and door. I am scared of how unpredictable and impulsive he is. He also has a past of violence toward us. I also believe he has undiagnosed bi-polar.

What should I do? The threats aren’t a as severe as “I will kill you” but nonetheless I am equally afraid for my life at this point.

What can my family do? Is there a point in notifying the police if he hasn’t physically done anything and the threats aren’t clear cut?

But it was hard driving to the river to snap some photos of it. I wanted to get off at the local Armory Street exit and go buy drugs so bad. But I didn’t. Then, after visiting the river I wanted to drive to Holyoke to buy drugs, but something stopped me again, and it wasn’t that my cravings had ceased because I am still obsessing. They have been that bad. But It was something somebody said in a comment once that made me stop and think. He said he couldn’t wait until a time came for me when there was no reason left in the world for me to pick up a drug. And you know what? There isn’t anymore. I realized that the last time I got high and relapsed it had nothing to do with anything bad. There was no excuse. Nothing was wrong. I just wanted to GET HIGH. 

But then there lies the problem of me being powerless over cocaine and heroin, especially when done together. I. AM. POWERLESS. I CAN NOT USE safely. I CAN NOT USE recreationally. I can NOT use moderately. I am just not that person who can do that, and don’t be fooled, with those two drugs, not many can. So what reason is there left to use? There is NO reason left on Earth. It doesn’t matter who dies; who leaves; who I fight with; how bored I am; who I celebrate with; who I believe or don’t believe; who hurt me; who I hurt, and so on... there is simply no reason left to pick up.

This will be a bit of a rant.

This is ruining my life. It sounds so easy to get over, but it’s not. I feel like everything I’ve tried has ultimately let me down. Therapy and meds don’t help enough (for this issue). Self-help/DBT/CBT hasn’t helped enough. I’m not able to go into a self-help group for this.

I don’t need a reality check. I’m past reality checks. Not only have I acknowledged I have a problem, I’m taking a billion steps to deal with it. I’m reaching out. I know my triggers. I don’t ask for money unless it’s life/death. I’m trying things — they don’t work, but I tried.

Conversely, I also feel weird NOT having someone tell me how much I’m secretly *not* seeing my addiction for what it is. I try to not acknowledge all the work because it’s not leading me to recovery. And also for some reason, it makes me low-key feel like a victim: “oh I’m suffering from an *addiction* so it’s not *my fault*...” and makes me feel less bad when I engage in it. I can’t even JOKE about it, because it somehow makes me feel like it’s okay. 

Anyone who tries to help always suggests establishing a budget. Here’s the thing: addiction doesn’t care about budgets! Heat of the moment, a budget is a “suggestion” when I’m in the mood to spend. As funny as that sounds, that’s reality for me.

The only thing I can actually see myself doing is getting some kind of financial-somebody to manage my money for me. They manage my bills, look through my accounts to see where I can trim the fat, and give me the extra. I honestly don’t see it working any other way — I’m totally fine with that. The only time I can actually control myself is when I’m forced to, anyway.

Any advice would also be helpful... just PLEASE don’t suggest anything I may need to *purchase* (I’m semi-serious about that).",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9961642026901245}"

When we had been together for about a year and were talking about moving in together, I found out he did cocaine recreationally. I told him that I was not looking to tell him what to do but that I wasn't going to be with someone who did any kind of drugs. He insisted that it was just something he did for fun and that he valued me much more than doing coke for fun. That was that, or so I thought.

When we'd been together for 6 years, one night when our second child was an infant, he went out drinking with friends and came home in an absolute rage. He screamed at me, kicked things, threw things, scared our oldest child, scared me, and I locked myself and my children in a bedroom all evening. The next day he said he had no recollection of what happened but was terribly sorry. I stayed at a friend's house with our kids for a week and when I said that I didn't feel comfortable with him drinking if this was what happened, he admitted that he had been doing cocaine but assured me that after hearing how he acted, he would never touch it again.

So... fast forward 5 years (last year). One of our kids wanted my husband's phone unlocked to play a game. I unlocked it and right there on the screen were flirtatious messages between him and a woman. I assumed it was an affair, but he told me he was flirty with her so he could get cocaine for cheaper and admitted to have been using cocaine intermittently over the years. He said it was because he felt unfulfilled in our relationship and because our youngest child is a bad sleeper, etc. etc.

I realize that I have my own faults- I took this as my own burden and felt like maybe I wasn't a good enough wife and that's why he was using cocaine. I tried to be better.

I discovered this weekend that he has a secret Facebook account for talking to women to obtain cocaine. He's of course very apologetic, he's crying, saying he'll never do it again. I told him that I was done and that he needs to leave. He is resisting this a lot. I suggested him going to an NA meeting and he said emphatically that he is ""not an addict."" He says that if I continue to be a good wife to him that he won't be tempted to use cocaine.

I guess I'm just looking for perspective. Not about whether or not he's an addict. But just... he's probably not going to change, is he? It's extremely hard to let go of 12 years with a person but I feel like this is my breaking point but I feel so conflicted.",46,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976517558097839}"

It was so difficult for him to even talk to me about it and I just want to help him, but he lives hundreds of miles away and I know realistically there isn’t a lot I can do. He is not in a good place and I’m really afraid for him. It’s clearly affecting his mental health significantly and he confided in me that the only way he could break his addiction has been through self harm, and every time he’s relapsed he goes through an intense cycle of self loathing and shame and disgust. It’s also dangerously affecting his physical health to the point where he could end up in the hospital if he can’t get it under control.

I want to tell his family because I know if something happened I couldn’t bear being one of the few who knew but did nothing. But I know he’s also struggling with telling them himself, and that would basically shatter his trust in me, and could even potentially worsen his feelings of depression and suicidal thoughts. We were incredibly close for a number of years and he’s like a brother to me, but we’ve gone through cycles of falling out of touch just because our lives went separate ways, and that’s life right? I already know that he’s probably feeling embarrassed for telling me all this last night. We recently reconnected because I’d been going through my own mental health shit that I’d ignored for my whole adult life, and he had always been so open about his anxiety and depression. And I think he was only able to talk to me about all of this because I opened back up to him. I’m afraid he’s going to pull away from me and lose touch with reality again though, spiraling into a never ending cycle of despair.

I don't like to think my cousin is an addict, but getting a reply from people that this sounds like addiction has opened my eyes a bit. How would you handle this?

My (35F) cousin (36F) is slowly spiraling out of control and she can't, or refuses, to see it. Her husband has talked with her and she gets overly upset. I've hinted at her issues and she gets overly upset. She has mental health issues that she isn't working on, is on the way to (or already is one) becoming an alcoholic, thinks she can do no wrong, and refuses to see how her choices are what makes her overweight and keeps her there.

She drinks at least a 12 pack of beer a day, even when she's the only one home with her son (19 months). Most days she drinks more than that, but never drinks liquor as that is supposedly what caused her to get her DUI about 10 years ago. 

She desperately wanted to become a mom, and her and her husband spend thousands of dollars on hormones and invitro. Almost immediately after having her kid, all she does is complain and foists him off on other people, sometimes without asking first. She yells at her husband over stupid shit, like he didn't take their son as soon as he said he would or he didn't empty the dishwasher the minute she asked. Ever since becoming a mom, she is always mad about something. 

She has mental health issues she uses as excuses for almost all her problems in life. Can't stick to eating healthy because of her ADD. Can't have a difficult conversation because of her anxiety. The list goes on. I struggle with anxiety and depression, so I can understand where she's coming from, but she's using them as a crutch. And she is on medication for all of them while seeing a therapist. She doesn't listen to her therapists reccomendatiins either. She has had multiple mental breakdowns this year (which I'm sure COVID played a role as well). She constantly wants to do reckless things, like go get a huge tattoo even though she has no money, spends the money she has on alcohol, and will call out sick from work to go get the tattoo. 

She is ruining her marriage little by little by constantly nagging and yelling at her husband for little things. As I mentioned above, she will yell at him for not emptying the dishwasher or some odd chore within a short time frame. The other night she gave him five minutes to empty the dishwasher and was upset when it wasn't done in five minutes. 

She is also becoming unhealthy. She's not eating right, restricting calories way too much, and gaining fat at an incredible speed. She has soooo much belly fat now that her belly sticks out beyond her boobs (she's an E cup). I'm not trying to fat shame her or anything, but belly fat is unhealthy as it usually eats you have visceral fat. She continues to gain weight every year and I'm afraid she could end up with health issues that could impact her life more than she realizes. I would hate to see her son lose his mom. She lost her mom due to cancer when she was younger and it was extremely difficult for her. With her life choices, I don't see her becoming healthy at any point. She won't take advice from anyone and states what she is doing is fine. She already has hormone issues and her doctor has suggested weight loss, which she thinks is bogus. I've explained how weight and alcohol can effect your hormones, but I'm somehow wrong even when I show her scientific articles on it. 

I don't know what to do. How should I approach this? Or should I let it go and let her live her life?",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9931868314743042}"

Long story short, my back is really messed up, particularly after a history of dangerous jobs. I currently work in a position that pretty much involves standing in place all day, and it is killing me.

Even after my weekend, my back made it like an hour before getting sore today. I've done this job for months and my back is in agony by Tuesday. 

It isn't tempting me to relapse yet, but I'm afraid that it will, as things like nicotine cross my mind when I'm in pain (I quit chewing a long time ago). The pain also causes depression and just makes me feel grumpy.

Any tips? With Covid seeing a chiropractor is tricky, and OTC's like advil and aspirin practically quit working. Stretching and soaking in hot water only relieves pain temporarily. I've tried almost everything...

I never spoke about it, no one knows the extent of it, so there was no worry on their part either. It simply made sense, that I just not say anything and never speak about it, no good could come from it and I could do as I please without hurting or worrying anyone.

But all of a sudden, a daydream popped into my head of telling my friend about my drug abuse. I pulled them aside and laid it all out for them, confession style. And I was overwhelmed with a feeling of sadness, and suddenly my silence stopped feeling natural and started feeling like it was strangling me.

I think not being able to speak about it has hurt my heart, I just didn't realize it. But it's true that my silence has spared my friends from worry, that breaking my silence would only cause trouble. So I won't say anything.

But I suddenly feel very tired and alone.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8704252243041992}"
