They don‚Äôt know my situation and I also don‚Äôt know why they want to hang out with me lol.

So at this point, now I‚Äôm feeling a little nervous because I don‚Äôt want to hurt their feelings by saying I don‚Äôt want to share a room with them, because I really don‚Äôt want to ruin their fun by well, being old and sober. I‚Äôm not sure what to do? 

Also, I‚Äôve got self-diagnosed social anxiety, which is a large part of how I began my long and tumultuous relationship with alcohol.

Since last months I have been questioning roots of my behavior using all the psychology  experience I had over the years of therapy and by testing my habits and trying to be honest to myself over the past and present events, and with help of meditation I realized that I actually have high-functioning addiction with easing the inner emotional pain and neglect, depression and fears by  chain smoking cigarettes', alcohol abuse when I cannot handle being alone, addiction for dating with guys to feel happy, social media and filling my brain with useless shit from this platforms and constant need for distraction with music, talking/texting etc. 

Since I have family history of really high addictive behavior-pattern (and I am from Balkan where everyone is kind of a addict ) and I know from first hand how destructive it can lead having any addiction and cause so much pain for addict person and family - I was convicting myself that I have control over this ""just a bad habits"" and pulling myself to be socially active, finish college, travel, volunteering etc. while having this demon over the shoulder and feeling like shit whenever I am alone. 

Since this lockdowns begins it only become worst and now is really hard to function on daily basis and for the first time trying to be truly honest with myself and search for solution(s). I mentioned that I have been on therapy and although it was really helpful for that period (psychotic breakdown at 19yo) now I don't see how same approach (psychoanalyst) it would help me to change this underlying issue which I was also successfully hiding from myself and therapist. My physical health is in a really bad state, honestly don't know where to start to fixing this symptoms since  I have been avoiding doctors checks and having huge fear of having some serious illness because of the often hidden auto-destructive lifestyle.

Since I am living alone in foreign country at this moment, but in a month will move back home, I want to somehow prepare myself and use time of having place for myself as productive as I can. I am not the best with following routine, having structure, being consistent. Often I am ""all over the place"" with ideas and interests so that passion for new knowledge and problem-solution thinking is making a confusion where to start, how and is it smart to tell anyone  in this phase from friends/family.. 

Things that help me most right now is meditation, writing and journaling, walks in forest nearby and piano music. Trying to keep track with that stuff and haven't took any alcohol in a month and limiting cigarettes' as much as I can. The more I do this ""connection to myself"" and getting rid of poisons, the more paranoid-panic side of me is awakening and the intense fear to get back into the psychotic state.

I am a 26 year old male and have been prone to addictions since my college days. I smoked marijuana everyday for almost 10 years of my life and also used to drink quite often. Its has been about 30 days since I last smoked marijuana and I am sailing through smoothly with my decision to quit smoking marijuana. I have reduced my alcohol consumption from fairly regular to occasional, but I still drink some times.

I have been smoking cigarettes on and off for about 15 years now, and I had managed to quit cigarettes for a good 2 year period in the past. But now, well, life happened and I find myself in tough spots and every time anxiety rings a bell, I tend to light one. 

I used to be a sports man until the recent past till about a year ago and could easily run a distance of about 7 Kms a day, and still have energy to do some basic body weight exercises. 

Last night, after about a year, I went for a jog and I found myself panting after a mere kilometer, and i just can't deny the fact that all these addictions, have taken a huge toll on my body. I really need some guidance as to how I can quit cigarettes for good. I really don't want my endurance to be so low that I can't run a measly 1 kilometre stretch.

Each time I pick myself up, and start over. This time has been different. I got a job, got raises and even got promoted to supervisor. All while smoking crack. I show up to work, do my job, work hard but then I go home and smoke crack. All my bills get paid but I always run out of money before I get paid  and goes days without eating. I don't mind not eating. I tell myself I don't need much if anything to be happy. I think i believe that lie. At the same time i don't feel like I'm missing out on anything, Im content with nothing. The things I do have, my apartment, my nice car and clothes don't mean much to me. I know this perspective is a gift and a curse. Right now I don't have any money and I'm happy to be sober, watching movies. I'm happy or as happy as I know how to be. The real problem is my mother and my 1 true friend. Both would do anything for me and just want me to be present in their lives. I try but I know I could be a better friend and son. My mom makes sure I have food and all my friend wants is to hang out. I always borrow money from my mom, pay her back then borrow it again. At times it feels like a vicious cycle, other times it feels like everything is fine. I hate this cycle.

2021-06-28 22:20:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/o9yyfh/worried_i_may_be_turning_to_sex_to_replace_drug/,Worried I may be turning to sex to replace drug addiction while in recovery,"I feel stupid to even be posting this but I wondered if anyone else who is or was in their early stages of recovery struggled with abstaining from uncharacteristic sex/ frequent masturbation in their first few months of sobriety? I feel like this is happening to me.

I by no means want to turn to drug use again and I am not worried that sex will make me relapse on substance as at the peak of use I was incredibly suicidal. I have been sober now for 2 months and have been trying to work on my compulsive addictive tendencies through reading and support and I‚Äôve noticed at times these addictive tendencies at times extend beyond drugs into other aspects of my life. I can be quite ritualistic about things I consume or do, such as video games and spending money for its own sake. 

I knew in my own recovery I couldn‚Äôt think of a relationship possibility until I‚Äôd worked on my health for a good few years and I‚Äôve abstained from sex since sobriety up until the last few days when a flat mate who is also an addict has been suddenly quite full on physically with touching me . When they kissed me I felt a rush that I hadn‚Äôt felt in a very long time and found it near impossible to pull away, and eventually we had sex. I felt practically feral and animalistic like I was hungry for it and unfortunately it happened again this evening. I should point out importantly I have/had no feelings of attraction to this person and yet I felt high feeling their lips touch mine.

I feel concerned I am enjoying the rush from physical touch with somebody I am not in a loving relationship with and worried I may begin to feel a compulsive need to have sex to continue these feelings. Has anybody else here experienced a need to replace substance use with physical intimacy, and if so, how did you deal with it? I can‚Äôt stand the idea of being addicted to something again, but even as my flat mate said they wanted me to fuck them again tomorrow I said yes like I was under a spell of lust, and reflecting on this alone only a short while after I feel like this is not in my character or good for my health. I am letting myself be tempted by something that makes me feel good and I guess validated and distracted, which were a few reasons I turned to drugs 9 years ago.

I can‚Äôt help but feel like I need to avoid my flat mate for a good amount of time while I focus on retraining my way past addiction. I am going to spend all my time after work tomorrow outside on a long hike until I get tired enough and go right to sleep and spend as much time as possible outside . I just feel ashamed at my reflexive mindless behaviour and alone with nobody to talk to. I wondered if anyone in this community found they were subconsciously swapping one addiction for another in the early stages? Or any stages? 

I guess this is half question and half ‚Äúoffmychest‚Äù so thank you if you‚Äôve read this much. I wish there was a way to factory reset my brain wiring so that my dopamine could level itself out. I hope discipline and isolation will help, but if you have any role models or resources that helped you especially I‚Äôd welcome those happily.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9866724014282227}"

I can only hope that this time I can ride this wave of wisdom to a better life. 

I have all the tell tale signs of addiction, and spend the majority of my time in the day on some sort of electronic device. It‚Äôs the only thing that truly brings me comfort anymore. 

My two biggest problems are:

1. Breaking the habit 

2. Finding other things to do


1. It is pretty easy for me to put my phone down now and again, especially when going out, as I believe that looking outside of a car door sort of hits the same note as scrolling on Reddit. But long term, it is seemingly impossible for me. I get symptoms of legitimate withdrawal, like either breaking out into a sweat or yawning a lot. I‚Äôve had this problem with so many bad things I‚Äôm doing to myself as well. I can stop initially, but the habits are stronger than me, off of power that I‚Äôve given to them.

2. I, especially with school over, have essentially nothing else I want to do in the time I spend on my devices. My greatest problem is my complete intolerance of discomfort, which has stopped me from doing so many great things. While I really should like playing with my little sibling, no matter how fun what I am doing is, I get tired of it. I just want to return back to the safety and complacency of my screens. This problem is only exacerbated when I do something outside that I do not need to do. I just make so many extreme slip ups when talking to people, and at this point, I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúinflict‚Äù myself upon others, for fear of ruining their moods. And to top it all off, I have basically invested all of my money that is meant for my entertainment into digital media, which leaves me with barely anything physically to do. I‚Äôve started an exercise regiment, which is just me lifting eight pound weights for half an hour, which is difficult enough to be uncomfortable, but not enough to make me any healthier.

The worst part of it all is, that I am more likely than not too late to save something that is very important to me, my vision.

It has gotten to the point where I think I may need glasses for the rest of my life. My worst nightmare is having a permanent ailment that was all my fault, and it‚Äôs coming true right before my increasingly blurry eyes.

Any other person with some form of self respect, determination, or just more energy could easily beat this, but I am me, and I am the most lazy, whiney bastard I‚Äôve ever known. I know it initially wasn‚Äôt my fault, but now it really is just me who screwed me over.

I‚Äôm so sorry to have to trouble you all, but I am lost, and will probably not act on any of this in the morning when I wake up. I just need something, anything to go off off to fix the issues that have been there ever since I can remember.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986227750778198}"

I would miss work because I was too tired/ill from the night before. All of my wage would go on coke. I would owe several people money at the same time (many a time I was probably close to getting my head kicked in). But then lockdown happened. I didn't stop using completely, but for some reason I managed to cut down a LOT. I know for a lot of people that extra time makes it harder to stay away from drugs just because of all that free time. But I somehow managed to go from doing 1.5-2 grams a night to doing 0.5 every week or so. I know that still taking coke just good and isn't exactly an achievement.

I've often worried about being a boring person and how I've put up walls around myself and today I think I've found the issue. Whenever I had had anxiety attacks that were bad I always tried to distance myself from it and could always 'feel' my emotions retreating deep within me. It was as if I shoved them into a jail cell and locked them up. I know understand how disruptive that was especially as a growing and maturing child. 

I think I used porn as a medium to feel something as I delusionally thought it might rekindle my emotions.

No longer acts like our mother, need help please!"," So, not sure where to start or who to turn to, if there is a better sub for advice please let me know. Idk what to do, this is all foreign to me and I'm shocked its happening. This is probably gonna be all over the place, please bare with me.. Back in December my mom downloaded this game on her phone called ""state of survival"" and she began playing all the time. In the beginning we didn't really notice much about it because she just did it a couple hours a day as a release from her stressful life (she is a teacher and is also working on her doctorate degree). I want to add in that I live 800 miles away from my parents, but I do visit frequently and my sisters and dad still live with her. Fast forward to April and we all notice a change in my mother. She is withdrawn and basically all she does is play this game. She talks to none of us, she forgets birthdays, she never calls me anymore or checks in on her grandson (my son, 11 months old). She misses his birthday. This is highly abnormal for my mother. She is all about sending cards and stuff like that but I tried to chalk it up to MAYBE she is just stressed. My sisters are telling me all mom does is play this game on her phone. I go down to visit and I see it for myself, my son even got into the toilet while she was playing this game because she wasn't paying attention to him when she was supposed to be babysitting, thank GOD I came home when I did because he was physically in the toilet. My dad pulls me aside and says he believes my mom has a major problem and to try and talk to her. So I do, I am a social worker and have hundreds of clients that I counsel monthly, so I didn't want to come off therapist like to her, but I just sat down with her and informed her she could open up to me. She told me she has met men on this game and one of them lives in Australia, he is a doctor and is telling her to come there. She seems to like the attention. She says she loves my dad,but also expresses wanting to leave him to move overseas with these men. She says she is scared if she leaves my dad he would kill himself (he has never shown signs of this being a potential... idk why she said this). She asks how I would feel if she moved overseas and I tell her I would miss her and if that's what she really wants and she says yes.¬† I'm floored, I don't even tell my dad this.... I go home (800 miles away) and I think on it. My dad calls me about a month later and says he has learned my mom has been spending $500 a day on this damn game, he sends me the credit card transactions and sure enough...somehow my mother has spent over $30,000 on this game in 5 months...I'm not even sure how this is possible!!! But worse, my mom is having multiple virtual affairs and I guess talking very sexually with multiple men... and not just vanilla sex shit. I'm talking dark, twisted kinky shit. I didn't wanna know details as it's my mom, but my dad had my tech savvy sister dig deep and she said there were things on there that could potentially cost my mother her job. They did say it was nothing with underage play or anything like that, that it was mostly disturbing I guess abuse sexual talk? Idk. Apparently this game gives you anonymity and you disclose your fantasies to strangers. They also found messages where my mom was plotting to move overseas. She said she had nothing home and that all her kids were grown and that she didn't really care to be a grandmother (shot to the heart, she was the best mom to me and I wanted that for my son. She is his only grandmother). This is not my mother. All that happened in April/May and my dad called me yesterday to inform me things had only gotten worse, that he believes my mom is brainwashed or something. She missed my birthday and she will not talk to any of us. We call, she ignored. I graduated with my MSW in May and she never said congrats. This is not normal behavior for my mother, she has always been the best most attentive mom on earth. She always calls multiple times a week to check in on us, I haven't heard from her since April. Apparantly all she does is play this game. She is leading my dad on and I feel so bad for him. They've been together 30 years and he is so crushed because I guess sometimes she tells him she wants to work things out and be together and then later will tell him she is leaving him for an Australian doctor. She goes back and forth and is really playing with him. My dad has called me crying multiple times this year. My mom says to him she will delete the game and she does for a day, then she downloads it back. She even bought a second phone to try and sneak play it, but they caught her. She is spending thousands and my parents are going to lose everything if she continues. When they try to bring it up to her she is convinced she doesn't have a problem and says that its just her release, that she doesn't talk to men on there anymore. But my sister took her phone and saw that she still does talk to multiple men very intimate and about living with them overseas. For all we know these men could be human traffickers! When my sister read through all these messages she said the man in Australia is basically brainwashing my mom and using tactics that cults use to recruit members. Her search engine showed she wss researching moving there and looked at plane tickets. Yesterday she told my dad she was gonna move overseas. She is so gullible and I am shocked! What can we do if anything.. I want my mother back. This is not my mother. I'm going there next week for the 4tg of July and my dad said we should stage an intervention... There is more that I'm probably leaving out but ill try to answer any questions. Please let me know if there is anything we can do. I'm so sorry this is so long. 

TLDR: 50 year old mother has became addicted to State of Survival and no longer wants anything to do with her family. She is playing mind games with my dad and talking to multiple men about really dark twisted fantasies she has. One of the men appears to be using cult recruitment tactics to have my mom move overseas with him. She now says she wants to move overseas and her searches reflect that. She has missed our birthdays and no longer talks to any of us. This is not our mother and idk wht to do. We want our mom back.

Due to insurance issues I stopped taking it and was off it for about a year. Then last August I was able to get my prescription back but have recognized that I am starting to abuse it so I am going to stop getting it filled. My biggest fear is coping with the comedown/withdrawal. Specifically the EXCESSIVE tiredness and exhaustion. Naturally, by taking more than prescribed I am running out of my prescription sooner than I am allowed to get it filled again and the fatigue I experience during this time is insane. I have noticed from past experience that it does go away (usually after about 3 days) but those 3 days are awful. I literally have no energy and feel extremely exhausted. I have to fight the urge not to sleep all day. 

Has anyone dealt with this symptom before? If so, what helped you lessen this symptom? Ideally, I want to taper off it so the comedown is a little smoother but the fear of this exhaustion has hindered my ability to do this in the past so I might need to just stop cold turkey.

The cravings come and go and it seems like a relapse is always just around the corner. The possibility for a relapse is always made worse when I use my phone too much. I'm starting to think that simply ditching the phone for a day may not be the best approach to overcome this. Rather, I need a sort of ""buffer activity"" in which I will always refer to when I have nothing on my plate. This way my mind will be somewhat engaged however, also open enough to think of other things to do. I'm thinking of doing meditation but am open to any others too. Any recommendations?

Unfortunately, my need to constantly be doing 'something' has lead to me using my phone quite a bit. I recently discovered something about myself. I am afraid (for lack of a better word) of being bored. Though I've noticed that through just relaxing and being bored, I've always come up with something to do; I seem to be afraid to allow myself to just be bored. The buffer I go to is using my phone. Which ends up being a negative cycle in which I end up having anxious episodes of worrying about not doing enough and just feeling down in general

That was like ten years ago when I was twenty. Since then it‚Äôs always kind of been that same routine.

About 25 or so, I began building a bit of a network and it seemingly became really popular in all circles of friends I associated with. People that never did it before that I would see after years suddenly are into it. It was just always around.

That said, I began having multiple connections. It was still always a monthly or biweekly thing if it was around. As I got a bit older, around 27 or so, I would have a few drinks and bam, we‚Äôre getting it.

As of today, at thirty, I struggle with it hard. I can‚Äôt have a single drink without that turning into another, then it‚Äôs off to races. I‚Äôm picking up almost every weekend. This has kind of been the case for about two years, but got to a point in late 2020, early 2021 where I was weekly copping and using.

There was a point where I began using midweek after some drinks (alcohol is it‚Äôs own issue). That‚Äôs when I was like, okay, this is an issue‚Ä¶ The minute I had to ask myself if it was a problem, I knew it was.

So, after one pretty terrible weekend I sat back and looked at the damage. I‚Äôd get myself into sketchy situations, drive drunk to cop (knowing I shouldn‚Äôt), lie about my use, all that. My circle kept on getting down though, so it was hard to detract.

I decided to give myself a good thirty days of pure sobriety and it was great. However, after a few summer parties this year and get-togethers, I‚Äôd test the waters with few drinks and that shit came right back.

There‚Äôs kind of no escaping it once I drink. It‚Äôs literally both or none, which is whatever, as I‚Äôd like to kick booze, too. I‚Äôm a very irresponsible drinker, coke or not, but now the two substances are married.

I‚Äôm currently struggling with quitting and keep justifying using and drinking by telling myself I have it together. A solid job and career aspects, a degree coming up in Finance &amp; Risk Management, a solid head on my shoulders, a good savings built, investments, retirement on track, married to the love of my life, etc.

With all of that said, I‚Äôm sorry to say that I have typed this out after blow‚Ä¶

I also apologize if I use any ill-advised language, as I don't really have any experience with addiction or opioids.  Third apology because I'm still pretty upset and just not a good storyteller, so this might be disjointed. 

I (38F) recently broke up with my boyfriend (33M) of a year due to his continued heroin use in the house.  For some background: I met him a year ago, and he told me about his past addiction, attempts at rehab and recovery, and homelessness on the second date.  It was kind of alarming,  but I appreciated his honesty, and it wasn't a deal breaker.  I actually really loved how easy it was for us to talk to each other about anything, and he seemed to be past that part of his life.  

I met him in the summer while my son (8) was visiting grandparents, and BF was relying on a pretty crappy person for housing, so I offered to let him stay with me until my son came home.  (I had been single for the entirety of my son's life, so I wanted to take things pretty slow for my son's sake...he gets really attached to people and I didn't want to hurt him in case we didn't work out.)  So my son heads for home and BF leaves the house, and I slowly introduce the two of them.  They hit it off like I knew they would, and I still wanted to take things slow, but BF got in an argument with the crappy roommate and left.  

He lived on the street for a while since he didn't have his own money (he was working for the crappy roommate and the guy stiffed him).  My son realized something was wrong, was worried about BF (as I was), and wanted to help, so we decided to let him crash with us until he could get on his feet.  It took about four months, but BF finally got a job and seemed to be doing ok even though our relationship was not.  He withdrew a lot, slept a lot on his days off, and didn't really interact with me or my son much.  I wasn't asking him for money so he could save it to get his own place, because I never really wanted a serious relationship and thought we'd get along much better if I didn't feel like he was leeching off me.  We stopped talking, and I started wondering if he was ok.  We had one pretty terrible fight with my son involved (BF got really drunk while home alone with my son), after which, BF promised to stop drinking so much.  

I'm not really sure he toned it down so much as learned to hide it better, but I knew having a job and a kid around and a fairly normal adult life was new for him, so I tried to nag as little as possible and just kind of withdrew from him.  Definitely stopped leaving my son alone with him.  (He was never mean or abusive, just sloppy and irresponsible.)  In retrospect, I feel pretty naive, but I started to wonder if he was sick, as he would sleep all the time, barely talk, nod off mid-sentence, and was losing weight pretty rapidly.   I asked pretty regularly for him to see a doctor, but he didn't have health insurance and kept insisting he was fine.  

After a month or so of this, we essentially break up and he starts sleeping on the couch.  Then it gets so much worse...he turns the living room into a cave, doesn't acknowledge us ever, and doesn't talk except to say how tired he is.  I'm stupid, but this is the point where I finally ask myself if maybe he's fallen back into using again, but convince myself it can't be heroin as he's keeping his job.  I ask him to get help again, he says he's depressed,  I tell him that's pretty obvious, but if there's something else going on, tell me and we can get you help.  He leaves and I'm not really sure I'll ever see him again, but he comes back that night, saying he happened upon a needle exchange, decided to go in, and that he's getting help through them.  I'm still pretty naive and think they're just helping him with trying to find housing, counseling for the depression, and treatment for Hep C (he knew he had it for a while but couldn't afford treatment).

A few days later, we get into another big fight, and he says he's going to start taking suboxone to treat his depression.  I was upset that he was going with what I thought was a bandaid rather than trying to figure out exactly what was wrong and get at the root of it, because I really thought he needed therapy.  (I also have a brother who has been a zombie for years because doctors just prescribe catchall drugs rather than really trying to help his specific set of problems, and I didn't want to see that happen to BF.)  I think this is the point where I realize he has been using and I've just been ignoring it, but I don't have definitive proof, so I don't accuse him of anything, just tell him I don't think this is the life I want, and that he should really get his own place now so we can try just being friends.  My kid, at this point, is really attached to him, so I did mean it...it wasn't just a ploy to get him out of our lives, as he's said many times. 

So he starts taking the medicine.  There are two...a pill and a strip (i think the pill is the Hep C treatment...please forgive me for not knowing exactly what they were...one of his major complaints from his past was that people who were trying to help him would baby him, so I tried to stay back and just support him where I could.  Also, I'm a single mom in a vicious career with pretty limited finances, so I unfortunately just get lost in trying to survive most days.)  

The first day he started taking them was also a pretty big day for him at work with some new opportunities opening up, and he had been very excited for it.  Well, about halfway through the day, he calls me to come get him as his boss is sending him home, saying he's too sick to work.   I pick him up and he looks TERRIBLE, swears he's reacting to the medicine which is reacting to a flu shot, and sleeps about 15 hours.  The next day, he heads to work, and less than two hours later, he's stumbling through my door completely out of it, barely able to stand, and almost completely incoherent.  He blames it on the medicine again, and I tell him he has to go talk to the doctor who gave it to him immediately as it's obviously not working.  I end up dragging him out of the house because he refuses to get help and he would terrify my son in that condition.  He comes back that night saying everything's under control, and I believe him.  

He has the next few days off of work, so now he's completely missed the opportunity he was so excited for, and I'm disappointed.  But he slowly starts to become a human again, then actually seems to be improving, and then actually starts to seem happy.  He says the medication is working, he feels good, he's alert and attentive, he starts talking to us again, he starts doing art again, and we even decide to give the relationship another shot.  It was a terrific few months or so, and we decide to go half on rent and to try this long term.  My son is over the moon.  I turn down a full-time job in another city to stick around.  Everything seems really good. 

Then one day, BF, my son, and I are all at home relaxing, and I go into the bathroom to do some laundry.  And on the floor is a paper bag with a few dozen single use needles, alcohol wipes, a rubber tie thing, and one hit.  And my heart breaks, and I know I should have made him leave right then because my son could've found all of it and God knows what would've happened.  But BF swears that he was weak, and that it's old and he must have dropped it when he was moving stuff out of a storage crate, and he hasn't used in forever and that I have nothing to worry about.  He makes me believe that it's so old that he forgot about it... that he started using during the depression because he didn't see a way out of it, but things are good now and he loves me and my son and he needs us.  He trashes the gear in front of me and flushes the heroin (his choice, not mine). So my dumb ass lets him stay, on two conditions: don't bring anything into my house, and stop lying to me.  I realize it's a sickness and that he needs help, so I tell him no judgement as long as he stops lying and stops putting my son in danger.  I really thought I could help him through it. 

And things are ok for about a week, until I go into the bathroom again, and this time it's a few used needles in a shammy cloth with maybe six hits.  I poke myself when I pick up the pack because one of the needles is uncapped.  My son was at school, so this time I don't hold back and I absolutely lose my shit.  It's a Friday, and I work out of town most weekends, so I give him until Tuesday to find a place and get out.  I come back really early Monday morning so my son can get to school, and the house is absolutely trashed.  And he is absolutely trashed.  There are bottles and cans of alcohol everywhere, crusted food, flies,  and nowhere to walk.  I get my son to school, then come back and tell him he has to go that night.  He's completely out of it, leaves for a long time, comes back, stays in the shower for a few hours, and hasn't packed anything.  So I put all his stuff in his crates and tell him to get out.  My son had come home from school and is in my room with headphones on--he's terrified and avoiding because BF is unlike I've ever seen him... completely out his mind, mean, and calling me every nasty name he can think of.  Telling me all if this is my fault.  My friend calls me while BF is raging, and she calls someone in my city to forcibly remove BF, but luckily, BF leaves before the guy comes, and my son and I have relatively peaceful night. 

About a week later, BF calls to apologize and ask if he can see us, which I allow as he's left most of his crates and needs to pick up more of his stuff.  He's a lamb and seems like he's doing well...he's staying with a coworker and is deeply apologetic.  He stays the night and it's a great one, we have a really long talk and it feels like everything will be ok.  The next day, the three of us are hanging out in my room when BF gets up to go to the bathroom.  My son picks up a case that was left in the seat BF was just sitting in, and my spidey senses just start tingling and I say, ""uhhh...BF... should he have that?""  And BF snatches the case, says it's his knife and is dangerous, and goes ahead to the bathroom.  The kid goes to play, BF comes back, and I ask him what's up.  He denies there's anything in it, and so I ask if he would open it to show me.  He says no, storms out, then comes right back and says it is what I think it is.  We talk for a little, and I tell him he needs to go.  No fighting... at this point, it's just sad. 

We keep talking on the phone and I try to stress how much I want to help him, but that he is a danger to my son and I don't want him around until he can sort himself out.  I tell him I love him, but I need him to love himself, and that only he can figure out how to do that.  Well, probably a week later, his coworker kicks him out and he wanders the streets for a few days, but still manages to make it to work.  He finds a hotel, but then does something to get kicked out before he even checks in (I was working out of town, so I don't know the details), so when I come back, I tell him that even though I REALLY don't want him at my house, I also can't let him wander the streets and lose his job, so he can stay for two nights until I have to leave town again.

The first night was great, but last night, he goes to take a shower and is in there about 30 minutes before I realize what's going on.  It takes minutes of banging on the door and calling him before he comes to and opens the door, and immediately starts denying everything, but of course I know what's up.  It isn't long before he gives me the case-- one needle and probably a dozen hits.  I take it, tell him to sleep on the couch and when morning comes, I don't want to see him again, but I want to give my son a chance to say goodbye.  It's 3am at this point, and he pulls like four beers out of nowhere, tells me he's going to go kill himself, and leaves.  I lock the door, turn off my phone, and go to sleep...I was in an abusive relationship before and that guy threatened to kill himself every time I stood up to him, so that was pretty much my last straw.

I still want the best for him, and I still want him to be ok, and I do love him, and my son desperately loves him, but I don't know what else I can do.  He came back early this morning to say goodbye to my son, and asked me to help him with some other stuff, and I flat out refused.  I kept believing the best in him, and I kept being shown the worst, and I don't want my son to see him like that, or to find his stash, or to find him dead. 

So I guess I wrote this ridiculously long, entirely-too-detailed post just to ask, what do I do?  I know he craves love and stability and a family, and I know we could give him that if he were sober, but I don't know how to help him get there any more.  I will take any advice you can give.

For the last couple of months, I've really put an effort into changing my living conditions in the hopes of making clean living just a little bit more easy, but what do you know, it doesn't really change a thing. Yeah my apartment looks a lot better with fresh paint and new furniture, but all is still just the same. Whenever I'm here, I feel so stuck. My thoughts and my emotions just bounces of the wall, making me feel sick and empty and lost. 

I've begun thinking about leaving. Packing a tent and a sleepingbag and just walk into the unknown. I feel a lot more functional whenever I'm out in the open. This apartment, and the choise it grants me, feels so unhealthy to me. I isolate behind my walls, feeling more and more sick and lonely and empty as days go by. I feel as if it will only be a matter of time before I'm knees deep into my drug use again. 

I know being homeless is tough, no glory in sleeping under the stars every night, but the thought of it becomes more and more appealing to me. Not the fact that I will be exposed to the environment and the weather and hunger all the time, I know I will hate myself for making such a choice when cold and wet and hungry, but being homeless would leave me without the choice of isolation. As long as I have this apartment, my anxiety chooses to stay behind the walls, isolating and hiding from the world. If I didn't have it - if I were homeless - the choice of hiding behind 4 walls would be pretty much non-existent, and I would be forced to survive. 

But that's exactly it. I feel as if my survivalinstinct is a lot more constructive/productive force than my anxiety is. If I act on my anxiety I just isolate. If I have to survive, anxiety is put aside, making many things more easy. 

I've been an addict pretty much as long as I can remember (25+ years). Got clean (relatively) in 2018, but I just can't cope with ""normal"" life. The demands of people and the surrounding society absolutely rips me to pieces.

&#x200B;

I've always been obsessed with sweets. i feel like my parents did everything right in terms of raising me and my sister food wise, not too much control but not too much freedom, yet we both still ended up with food problems. she eats too much and is overweight, i eat too little and have always been slim, but am obsessed with sugar. I've recently had less control over my weight because my metabolism has changed with age and my addiction has completely left my control. a year or two ago I reached that point of spending ¬£10+ on sweets, biscuits and other unhealthy snacks and hiding them away like a squirrel or something. no matter how much i've bought, i will almost always get through it in a matter of days. if anyone buys something sugary to share, i always find a way to eat more than my fair share. sometimes i've even eaten a whole pack of biscuits and bought another one to replace it out of shame... then eaten some of those too.

I sort of know what to do - I know I CAN'T have sugary things stocked in the house. I am somewhat of a shut-in, so even if i only ate sugary things when i went out with friends, that would probably be okay. the problem is the in between. for me it's like walking on a tightrope 5cm above the ground and constantly thinking ""but I could just get off the rope and walk, it would be easier"".

My question is, those of you with an addiction as bad as or worse than this, how do you cope with not having sweets/sugar? The times where you're not having any at all? it's not physical withdrawal that is so much the problem, for me i am just completely unhappy. Sugar gives me such an intense rush of dopamine that anything else seems pointless. It starting to feel like it's the only thing that makes me happy or feel good. I am on antidepressants for anxiety, and it has made me much more emotionally stable, but now i'm wondering if theres some correlation between my mood stability and my desire for an intense rush? I don't know. but the last few months it's been a huge source of shame - I can't fit into my old clothes because i've put on weight so quickly. I'm still 'slim' by society's standards, certainly by my extended family's standards (i have quite a few obese female relatives) but I've put on a stone and a half in the past couple months alone. I've always been able to reel it back but I can't at the moment. Does anyone have any advice or insight?",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992892742156982}"

How do I help my problem?,"I always thought an addiction had to be one substance you go crazy over and can't stop using. I've never been able to find a steady supply of something enough to use it for long periods of time like an addict would. 

Even before I'd ever even tried drugs I experienced depression. Depression as well as environmental factors often lead to giving in to unhealthy cravings, especially drugs. 

When I first tried alcohol I started developing a minor problem, but slowly gained more and more control until I could almost cut it out completely. But on a down day, I tried a vicodin leftover from surgery.  I had 15 of them, but by the time I ran out I was snorting them. The withdrawal sent me into panick, using anything I could for a high. I started using weed, loperamide and alcohol regularly, but would've taken anything stronger. 

I detoxed from everything for almost two weeks to try an antidepressant, Wellbutrin. But again, on a bad day I snorted the Wellbutrin and got high. I got a few more highs from that before switching strictly to weed for about a month. Then I had another down day, and surprise... I tried meth.

I loved the high I got from it, but promised myself I'd never get high off it more than once a month to avoid addiction. I started trying to use small amounts to help me with work, but within about a day or two I lost control and started using more and more than I originally intended. 

I have only been using meth for a little over a week, but I think I have a problem already. Is this the result of a mental illness? And if it is will it go away with the mental illness? Or is this an addiction? And if so what steps should I take to stop?

I'm 17, but I absolutely don't think my parents will be able to get me help, as they both struggle with mental illness as well. I'm definitely considering therapy or even a treatment center in a few months when I'm 18. But I'm afraid that if I continue using longer, I'll lose motivation to get help by the time I'm 18.

Addiction is such a cruel disease. While we‚Äôre using, we feel guilty about it and wish we could control it. While we‚Äôre ‚Äúsober‚Äù we‚Äôre in our heads battling temptation, until we eventually relapse again. Did this dance off and on for over 20 years. 

For me, it wasn‚Äôt pretty. I didn‚Äôt hit rock bottom. I lived there. I wasted so much time trying to understand this disease when I should have just accepted it. I‚Äôve been in and out of AA, in and out of detoxes, but this last time, I tried to end it all by taking a bunch of pills, and wasn‚Äôt successful. My mom found me and called 911. I remember the EMTs were all young and asking me why I did this. I remember my answer. I said ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm almost 40, I live with my parents, and I hate my job.‚Äù I broke down sobbing. I was freshly divorced due to my drinking, I no longer had my kids with me all the time, and life was definitely not where I‚Äôd hoped it‚Äôd be. 

They took me to the hospital. I got my stomach pumped. I couldn‚Äôt even succeed at that. I laid in that hospital bed for days while someone who I didn‚Äôt know sat in the room with me observing. I felt like the biggest fuck up ever. But I also finally felt like I did not want to feel that way anymore, ever again! That‚Äôs what it took for me. 

That was last year. Not a lot of time under my belt, but now I make an intentional decision every day to abstain and grow. Since then, I‚Äôve done A LOT of reflecting. I do everything now with mindful intention. When I go to work, I make it a decision to do the very best I can that day. Then I do better the next. I do this with every aspect of my life. My parenting, my self-improvement, my finances, my sobriety. Everything has changed for the better because I set my intentions for only that day to do my very best at whatever the hell it is I‚Äôm doing that day. 

Since last year, I‚Äôve been promoted,  I‚Äôve been able to save money. I‚Äôve taught myself how to invest. I‚Äôm learning Spanish. I‚Äôm learning about computers. I‚Äôve made meaningful healthy friendships. Most importantly though, I‚Äôve made a deep connection with my kids and am always honest and open with them. I am no longer in pain. I am free.

Recovery will always be a individual journey but I think that there is a core truth to the principle of the journey, which is to STOP FKN UP OUR LIVES.

i am ready to get sober and excited but i absolutely don't want to tell anyone because i am so ashamed for them to know how i have been living, but i am also afraid of doing this alone. i don't have health insurance but really want to see an addiction counselor.
i am also really scared because i have been reading about withdrawal symptoms and what to expect because I have felt fine the past two days other than a headache and being sweaty (which im fat and its summer so that's not too strange), i was hoping maybe I skirted anything terrible but a lot of people said they didn't experience any severe withdrawal symptoms until the fourth day sober and now I am so nervous i want to cry. i'm a hairstylist and can't be sick and having hallucinations at work. i'm so anxious about it, not anxious enough to drink but i just don't know what to expect.

For me, I used because I couldn‚Äôt confront stress from work, a friend not inviting me out with other buddies, not completing a hike I use to easily run up, etc. The more I used, the more I was unable to both confront my inability to grow and actually grow. This fueled my addiction and my ‚Äúneed‚Äù for it.

Anyway, my point is that when you start not just not using, but actually growing‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a huge eye opener to what the drugs inhibit.",54,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9720447063446045}"

But about a month ago some shit went down around my house and it ended up with my dad in the hospital and my sister back in a mental institution. I was pretty stressed out and so was my mum, she broke her 1 year sobriety and started drinking again, and i did something really fucking stupid. I went out the next day to go to school but when i got there i felt like complete shit and jumped the fence to go meet up with my dealer and get some vyvanse, i was in really bad shape and just wanted to get high so when i met up with him and he told me he didn't have any vyvanse i asked what he did have and he sold me a cap of heroin for $15. I didn't know how to take it so we went back to his place and he asked me whether i wanna shoot it or bump it, i'm scared of needles so i said i'd bump it and he crushed it up into a small line and i sniffed it. I felt so good like everything was cool and nothing was wrong with life. After about 30 mins the high was gone so i also bought a gram of bud and went home, later that night i couldn't sleep so i had about 3-4 cones and felt absolutely nothing. When i woke up the next day i felt like shit so i skipped school again and went to meet up with my dealer and told him the bud was shit so he gave me another free cap of heroin and got some beers. I asked him to crush it up for me again because i didn't know how much i should do at once but he told me if i really wanted to do it i should shoot it, i felt terrible so i completely forgot about my fear of needles and said ok. He cooked it up and filled the needle and injected it for me, it was the best i have ever felt in my life, better then vyvanse for sure. since then i have been shooting heroin about 2 times a week when i can't get speed, but recently i've started getting cravings when i go too long without it. I use it mostly to go to sleep after doing shit tons of speed but i've lately started skipping school to go shoot up which i never used to do. i turned 16 last week and i don't want to ruin my life before i do anything with it.

I was good for around a year never quitting everything at the same time but managing it very well with soft drugs and not in excess. Then over the past year it‚Äôs become a much more damaging and prevalent thing.

I work at a beer retailer and am surrounded by it and it‚Äôs allowed to sample a beer or two at work and easy to drink more and sometimes secretly. I and by myself for a lot of the time there and it‚Äôs just become much worse over the past month or two since my girlfriend and I broke up.

Im fucking taking kratom again. It‚Äôs only been about 3 weeks of daily use since I quit a 4 year addiction to it and managed to stay off it for a couple months. The withdrawals won‚Äôt be too bad this time but I gotta do it now and not let it slide since it‚Äôs the least harmful thing I take. 

I am occasionally driving home from work drunk and usually at least buzzed. It‚Äôs only a 5 minute drive and on back roads but still. That‚Äôs fucked up.

Me numbing myself every day has left me depressed and apathetic. They give me nothing. They don‚Äôt make me happy and stagnate my life. I‚Äôm at a pivotal moment and need to move and get and apply for jobs and start my life. I‚Äôm sick of doing the same unproductive shit every second I am not working.

I am not struggling, per se, with addiction currently, however, it seems that I am having a weird feeling towards something that feels like what addiction is and I don't quite understand why. I have not been historically addicted to anything really (besides caffeine) and it is not very present in my family history, which is why I am a bit confused. 

So, I started a new pre-workout for the gym recently and watched a video that explained how sodium really should be taken separately than being included as an ingredient in a pre-workout formula because if it was included, the ratio of sodium per serving versus everything else would make the supplement taste terrible. With this in mind, it was advised that a dose of sodium be taken along with the pre-workout before I go to the gym separately, so that is exactly what I did this morning.

Long story short, I have had this incredibly strange feeling today that is making me want to go consume another teaspoon of sodium, and I am finding it extremely strange. I am concerned about why this feeling of ""addiction"" or rather maybe the potential of addiction is happening for such a strange substance to consume, especially since the actual process of consuming a raw teaspoon of sodium is not pleasant at all. I am not very knowledgeable about this subject and, again, really hope I did not offend anyone for posting about this. I am aware that it can be a sensitive subject for many people and recognize that I am fortunate enough to not have any major struggles currently. If anyone who has a better understanding of this type of mental behavior has any advice or explanation for why my brain seems to want more of something that is not enjoyable whatsoever, I would really appreciate the info.

Listening to Ram Dass and Eckhart Tolle and living in the NOW, breathing exercises and meditation, following the 12 steps, listening to Dr. David Hawkins helped so much.
Learning what self love is and focusing on it nonstop. Forgiveness of all wrong doings. Letting go of self pity, guilt, and shame.
I bought a rose quartz rock and focused on the breath and taking in love.
Let your addictive personality find a new focus. I am literally aware of my breath at all times.
When you are right here right now...that space between the breaths.....notice that. Take deep ones in and out. Watch the rise and fall of it. What do you feel in between the breaths?

The catalyst for going to treatment was me watching my best friend OD and turn blue right after we scored and instead of immediately calling 911, I made myself a huge fucking shot and got well.

I've found that when I'm finally not using and not participating in compulsive escapism that:

 1) I'm incredibly bored: without a constant focus, I have to constantly think of things to do


2) I'm much less angry/impatient. Unknowingly,  when using or compulsively escaping, I'm always trying to get back to it. Everything else is a bother, and takes too much time, no matter what it is. Everything else is a waste of time that's coming between me and my fix. I can't fully focus on the task at hand, or be present. 

I didn't realize the level of control addiction had on my life, even when I wasn't using or i was in recovery. I've learned that true recovery isn't just stopping use, but changing how I live. Learning to live presently and without escape. Take charge of my life and actively participating in it.

It comes in the form of vape juice, it is dark green coloured (as if someone had poured green food colouring into it). It was marketed as a cbd juice which is why I started, however upon getting high from it the first time I realised is probably wasn‚Äôt cbd. Nonetheless I didn‚Äôt stop (absolutely retarded I know). The high feels very similar to a very intense marijuana high, Reminiscent of if you were to smoke some really strong thc oil or smth and didn‚Äôt really have any tolerance. It feels very similar to when I first started smoking good kush and would get mildly greened out. A very intense body buzz and mind high. However with this oil it has a much shorter lasting effect, in the beginning it would trigger the really intense high for about 10-15 minutes, and obviously as I gained a tolerance it would get shorter and less intense. (I only mention that as it shows that it is something you can gain a tolerance for, which might help narrow it down). In terms of withdrawal symptoms, the biggest is my breathing, whenever I go more than maybe 6 hours without the juice, I start really really struggling to breathe. It feels like my lungs can‚Äôt physically expand enough to take in enough air. Other symptoms include mad sweat attacks, physical numbness in my legs and hands, and a general discomfort and dizziness. There is also a slew of mental and emotional symptoms but based on what I‚Äôve read they seem to be pretty standard across most drugs.

Apologies this sounds like a doctor‚Äôs visit! I‚Äôm not looking for a diagnosis or anything like that, I‚Äôm just looking for anyone who has had a similar experience. 

So, about 5 weeks ago I started to taper off of my buprenorphine script. Compared to any other time I‚Äôve done this or had to deal with withdrawals, it‚Äôs been an absolute breeze! I am in the best headspace possible to be doing it this time around, so I‚Äôm very thankful for that. However, ‚ÄòI think‚Äô I‚Äôve been having some unusual withdrawals/side effects of the reduction pop up this past week, and I am just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience, as this is very weird and very annoying!

So normally I‚Äôd expect, achy legs, sweating, muscle aches in general, runny nose/flu-y, etc, just the usual stuff. However, on the 3-week mark exactly, I started to get a sharp headache in my right temple. On and off it went all afternoon, then it alternated to the left. To the point I had to take my glasses off and stop working on my laptop. By the evening, the headache was only at the back of my head and accompanied a neck ache. This ‚Äòback of head‚Äô headache was almost like a weird brain freeze and had a strange tightness to it, like my brain was pushing against my skull or something. By the evening, I was forgetting words and feeling incredibly dizzy/woozy like I was going to pass out and generally feeling weak. (As you can imagine, tapering off the meds but looking and feeling super high doesn‚Äôt exactly bode well).

(I might add here that the reduction is a fairly slow one, I haven‚Äôt used, used more or less bupe than I should have, and literally nothing else had changed or could be a contributing factor that I can think of. If anything, the only thing that did cross my mind was that they‚Äôve been giving me a weird brand of the tablets I‚Äôve never had before).

It‚Äôs now been 10 days since this started. It lasted at full power for about 7 days, gradually getting better, to the point now where I can still feel it a bit (slightly dizzy, mild neck ache, and weird back of head tightness) but mostly it appears to be at bay. Mind you, I can‚Äôt figure out whether it‚Äôs getting better or I am just getting used to it. 

I went to my regular GP and got checked out on the off chance it was something else, but they didn‚Äôt seem too concerned. So, I am wondering if anybody else on here has had any similar withdrawals or weird headaches and dizziness in general while tapering, or withdrawing from bupe or any opioid, or opioid replacement in general?

2021-06-21 06:23:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/o4s1nz/my_story/,My Story,"Hi :)

I started this post to ask a genuine question, but I've ended up ranting on about my experience. So, if you do wish to have a read, then thank you for being here :). I will post my question separately. 

Long-time lurker of this sub. Created a new account to keep things nice and separate.

A little background:

Used prescription opioids (on a very slowly but gradually getting worse basis) for about 8 years. Such a cliche story, but I got a script from the doc for a genuine reason and it went from there. Ultimately ending in many stories between 2016 and 2019 of insane lapses, relapses, dark web activity, lies, tears and eventually losing everything of the little I had left. I'm talking, family, friends, partner, the brand-new amazing job that I had etc, etc. I know many have been there and this is nothing new, but despite that, this is my story. 

Much of this however, somehow, spurred me on to change. And I mean really change. My last major relapse in 2019 really triggered something within me. I was a shell of the person I used to be, acting aggressive, entitled and many more etc, and I just didn't recognise myself at all. I was doing things that I would have never dreamt of before! Dangerous, stupid things, just so that I could get high or just to feel 'normal'. To some degree, I don't think I really cared what happened. But something had to change, or I was going to end up dead, or worse have my selfish actions hurt somebody else. 

Finally, with the help of my partner, family and a couple of great support groups and buprenorphine, I have been able to stay clean of illicit substances for over 2 years now. It feels amazing to be able to say that! Through all of this, I managed to get my head straight, doing a kind of CBT on myself, and a hell of a time of hard work, day in, day out, I changed my whole outlook on life. To the point where I have been confronted with or come across drugs, I could have easily taken, and I either decline, or put them back, or whatever the situation is. 

Sidenote: If nobody minds me saying, I am so super proud of myself to be able to be in a situation I can handle opiates physically and put them down and say no, without much thought. Don't get me wrong, I know there is a very fine line I have to be aware of in case something goes wrong, and thankfully this sort of scenario doesn't happen often, but this is a huge, little win for me.

Me and my family are great now, me and my partner (same partner during the worst years of this) are better than ever, engaged, starting a family etc etc, and I am finally building my life back up. I am moving forward, I'm not trying to claw anything back, I am just working on the future. 

I am off my antidepressants, which this time around, I found super easy to process, which was very weird, given previous experiences of horrible side effects etc. I've also started to taper off the buprenorphine and for the most part, again, I've had little to none of the side effects I am used to, so far. For contrast, the last time I tried this a few years ago, I went through hell. I was always thinking about the withdrawals and getting a fix, to the point I finished the taper completely and 10 days after being fully clean, I successfully begged the docs to go back on the bupe (I think they thought I'd gone back to using or something. In my opinion now, I really don't think they should have put me back on the bupe, especially at the dose they did (Which made me very sick!). Fortunately I ended up moving services to get to where I am now, as there was a few other things that were wrong too) but there were lessons for me to learn, and in a way, I'm glad I went through this experience, as its culminated in things being how they are now.

Speaking of culmination, I will tie this up here for now. My point of going in this direction, is to say that despite the main block of our stories perhaps starting similarly, and being cliched, all the experiences (bad or good) that we have are individual and our own. Everything that has happened to any one of us, has culminated in being exactly where we are now. With this experience and learning, it‚Äôs what we choose to do next that counts. I put myself and others through one of the worst experiences people can have, but there is always a way out and a way forward, that is positive and ultimately where everyone can be happy. How the present and our futures progress, doesn't need to be based on the past. 

I personally believe a lot of this is about the way we think. When confronted with getting clean, I used to worry, like genuinely worry that I would never be able to take opiates again. Like it was going to be a significant loss. Now, I barely even think about it. I'm not saying my experience is everybody else‚Äôs answer, or saying people should think themselves clean, because that‚Äôs ridiculous. What I am saying, is it's possible. It is absolutely possible like anything else, if you want it enough. There are so many great things outside of drugs to live for and there will always be a support system somewhere, to guide anyone that wants it. It won't be easy, it will be damned hard work, but it is definitely something worth fighting for and the rewards are colossal! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with my choices since making the decision to fight back and I really hope there are other people out there choosing to do the same. :)",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9892702102661133}"

I truly want to know what I can do‚Ä¶ 

My boyfriend is homeless‚Ä¶ his family and I agree that he needs to hit his rock bottom and get help. He‚Äôs a cocaine addict. He‚Äôs been sleeping at his job site. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure if believed him that he was sleeping at his job site and asked him every day for 2 weeks to prove it to me. I was so desperate that at once point I said prove it to me, and you can come stay with me‚Ä¶ but he didn‚Äôt. Then this past Friday he finally did by passing his phone over to someone he works with that confirmed he was sleeping there (he sees him there every morning when he gets to work). So then my bf started on ‚Äúnow you have the truth so let me come stay with you.‚Äù And I started to talk a bit about how I felt it was too late and I was hesitating, and then he hung up on me. I tried to call him later and couldn‚Äôt get a hold of him most times that I dialled his number. When he did pick up he was doing the usual run around of lies of what he was up to and where he was and said he‚Äôd call when he was done work. Well finally at 10 p.m. I was getting fed up. I called him a few times but he didn‚Äôt pick up, and then he put his phone on do not disturb. He normally does this when he is using to not be disturbed or when he‚Äôs in an area that he knows he shouldn‚Äôt be. 

I wanted to know the truth so I walked to his drug dealer‚Äôs place and sure enough his van was outside. I took a pic of the van and sent it to him. Then I asked politely for him to come outside and speak to me, and explained how disrespectful this all was and that this is not recovery and I‚Äôd like to see recovery. He said if I had only said ‚Äúyes‚Äù right away to letting him stay with me that he wouldn‚Äôt have done this. I don‚Äôt know what to believe. Is this manipulation? Did I go back on my word? 

This is a tough situation for me. He admitting to using that night. I could tell anyways that he had‚Ä¶ I tried to end the relationship because I am so sad and broken, but he got angry, got in the van and drove off and blocked me for the rest of the night. We spoke a bit yesterday, but he spent the day with his Mom so it was more like talk to you later type of check ins, etc.

Today he‚Äôs been calling me, asking to come to stay with me. I love him but I fear I‚Äôd be enabling him‚Ä¶ I do feel bad like maybe I‚Äôm going back on my word though as well. I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I really am. But again, I‚Äôd been asking for proof of that for 2 weeks‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs so complicated. It‚Äôs none of my business perhaps, but I just wanted to know that he wasn‚Äôt staying with his drug dealer or cheating on me as he has in the past. I don‚Äôt understand why he couldn‚Äôt just prove to me that he was sleeping at the job site. He wouldn‚Äôt let me come by, but he let his parents go by to see him there. He claims it is because he didn‚Äôt want me to know where he was working and make a scene. 

Now I just feel horrible. I said I‚Äôm not ready for you to come back to live with me. Oh and I forgot to mention that he also missed an open CA meeting on Saturday morning that he had previously said he‚Äôd go to with me. So not only am I not ready because of trauma from this past year of his lying and cheating, I don‚Äôt think he is ready for recovery. But he is saying now that I‚Äôm not helping him stay away from bad people and that he will continue to lie and cheat on me now because I‚Äôm not giving him a home. 

Wtf is going on?

He‚Äôs worse than ever and calling me names like bitch and cunt now. 

I‚Äôd said I‚Äôd go swimming with him today and we could talk, but he just keeps ignoring anything I say and says ‚Äúgive me an answer.‚Äù He‚Äôs tired of me dicking him around and I think I might be. It‚Äôs weird. I love him and want him back (the real him, not the addicted him), but I think I need to see clean time and behavioural changes, but I also want to know that I‚Äôm not being cheating on so I continuously check in on him. What do I do or what can I do moving forward?

He keeps saying that because I‚Äôm not letting him live with me that he‚Äôs going to be an addict‚Ä¶ I tried to mention meetings, and he said the serenity prayer is bullshit. I really want him back, but I am really lost at the same time. Some days he breaks down and says let‚Äôs go to a meeting, but on days like today he‚Äôs just mean and desperate for me to feed and house him I think, but it‚Äôs scary bc I don‚Äôt want him to use me as an excuse to go use‚Ä¶",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989393353462219}"

Today I‚Äôm thankful I didn‚Äôt get more, but I‚Äôm still suffering from the bad choices that lead me to do it and the chemical imbalance in my brain. 

I think I might have to ditch alcohol for life. That idea frightens me, but I guess it might be my only solution.

Basically there was an addiction study carried out on rats called Rat Park. I won't go into fine detail about it as a quick Google search will bring up all the info you could possibly want. In short the study showed that when a rat was placed in a cage and given the choice between water or water laced with drugs, the rats choose the drugged water over and over untill they died. 


However the study found if the rats were placed in a cage with all the things that they could possibly desire, the rats would try the drugged water once and not touch it again. 

Essentially my therapist pointed out that similar to the rats in the addiction experiment, part of the cause of my addictions is because my life is lacking in many other areas, leading me to keep going back for more over and over. He suggested that if I had my own Rat Park I wouldn't have the necessity to escape my pain through my addictions.

So go out and build your own Rat Park people, I have been working on my own over the last couple of weeks and it is really making see life has so much more to offer, leading me to think less and less about escaping.

It's obvious she was depressed, but she refuses to get a new job even though there is currently an abundance of places looking to hire. Some nights I would notice her acting a little funny but I only live at home 4 days a week and the other I live with my boyfriend. I have always been suspicious even before she was laid off because my mom is a consistent alcohol drinker and alcoholism runs in her family. My dad keeps her in line when it comes to that, but anything else hard drugs wise would be kept in the dark because my dad is VERY straight edge. I mean this man wont even drink soda let alone condone anything as extreme as what my mom is doing behind our back. I have heard my dad argue with her ""in private"" about getting help for something, but I could never hear for what and i didn't want to accuse her of anything. I did hear her tell him she didn't want help so that makes things tricky. 

So today, I came home on a weekend for a few hours while my boyfriend is at work which I normally don't do. My brother and Dad are out at a fathers day golfing tournament so she expected to be home alone. When I came home I walked inside and saw her asleep (yes breathing) on the couch with an ashtray and half a cigarette ( not lit) which she is also not suppose to be smoking in the house.

I didn't want to touch or move it and risk waking her up. I think its safe to say she is using, but I am unaware what I should do or how I should approach it.

I was always so wasted on bottles of liquor, soaring high on amphetamines when dusk went to dawn I remember my head spinning with tears as I expressed myself for the first time in almost 2 decades. 
So alone in the dark I would sit, b horror movies would flicker on a tv reflecting against the hard woods floors in that tiny apartment. 
In that tiny apartment a part of me was lost within the new order lyrics and the empty bottle blanking my memories completely out. Gaps of my life gone to gin, I'd chug from the bottle as I talked manically in circles to myself, or anyone whod listen.
A part of it remains, inside that tiny apartment with the crying walls and old winding stairs.
 rotting within the time beneath those stairs I won't ever get back.

The mirror shined with tiny crystals and I'd feel ok until the crash..extreme highs and lows like I never felt before in my life. I won't ever get that time back, I won't ever see that girl again. I won't ever be the same person I was before this shit destroyed me and the girl I once was. 

 it was so dark, and my cheeks were so wet and alone I felt with an ache in my gut, heart gone cold. 
The apartment left a hole inside of me, parts I can't ever escape. 
Blood stained the white fur carpets, gashes covered their body, crying alone I panic. 
I am helpless. I still worry. 

Self destruction was the only way to my salvation, growing out of the self hate, I kept the toxins deep in my bloodstream as I would pull the skin from my fingertips until they were bleeding, throbbing and numb.

I felt home, in this broken shelter I could build onto the chaos and finally stop feeling so fucking much.

Insanity grew, paranoia began to consume every inch of my pathetic existence. I was skin draped over walking stilts barely alive, breathing just barley, coughing through the blood, corroded lungs and bones in a bag I had started to become.

And the journey *is* pretty interesting.

Having worked (as a [CADC](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=cadc+certification) and more) with about two thousand addicts in recovery since 1987, it's obvious to me that the **dire need for distraction** from uncomfortable shame, guilt, worry, remorse, regret and morbid rumination is what drives pretty much all forms of addiction to substances and behaviors like gambling or pornography.

See [Will the Addict Ever Stop Using SOMETHING if He or She remains Depressed, Anxious or Shameful](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/11/will-addict-ever-stop-using-something.html), especially once those emotions become part of the [Cycle of Addiction](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=cycle+of+addiction+image)?

But if one plows into ""[digesting and discharging](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-10-steps-of-emotion-processing.html)"" the (usually early life) experiences that are at the bottom of their mountain of emotional discomfort, they can count upon ""stepping down"" to (usually) less self-destructive forms of addiction (e.g.: online gaming, romantic obsession, workaholism, over exercise, shopping, road tripping). And *some* former junkies and crackheads will actually reach a place where life's challenges can be managed with no more difficulty than replacing a dead auto battery or mowing the lawn. 

Because what *seemed* to be ""sooooooo hard"" when we were IN our major addictions, will look a lot different when we're *not*.

We make it look so easy,
The wsy we walk so freely
The way we go around destroying 
Writing in the chaos like it was a poem
Oh we deserve this¬† 
Oh we deserve this pain
For the time that we took being so vain
Knowing we were both insane
Knowing we cant play this game
Knowing nobody can stop us from the thoughts in our brains.
Baby You can see the mess behind us as we're walking away.
Staying busy just to keep the bull shit away
Relieve us of our shame 
But it stays. 

Making so much noise 
To match the voices in our heads
Will they ever be dead?
I dont think we could be friends.
I dont think I want to be solved 
Please lets play pretend 
Please don't hurt me again
I thought that we could be friends.
But I did it again
You really want this to end? 

Loving you was like loving me for a moment 
I found a new component 
Stored it in my head and helped create the next moment 
Always losing focus,¬† can't live in the moment 
Can't survive alone unless we are going out of focus
Yet the stars did align.
For a moment in time, 
Yeah you'll never be free,
You're just another tradgedy, 
a tiking time bomb and a coward 
Dont you see? 
I do hope you get what you want,
Dying happy all alone
Smile on your face as you prepare to go. 
Leave behind all of the pain because the drugs they take it all away.
In the night and in the day, 
We drink it all away
But ill be the last one to fall
Because I can never have it all 
A big sacrifice and then i'll get it all
Ill never really fall, 
You never really call
I hold on to your number like ill never have to fall

I just hold on

Free to be me?
Free you from me? 
Free to be free? 

Will I be rid of this anger, this pain?
Will i survive the change in my brain?

Surrender your soul,
Surrender yourself to feelings unknown,

I've flt for a long time that everyone else was so farther ahead of me in life. Seeing my cousins used to bring me joy but now it brings me pain because they're younger then me and already so successful and have bright futures ahead of them. They always got stuff going on with their lives and with me, they can only just figure to ask ""so is X still your favourite movie?"" My goal was to become a filmmaker/storyteller. I did a college program in Office Administration, something I hated but I did it as a favour to my parents. Then I enrolled myself in school for a one year program in screenwriting. I was excited for it. Back then, I had this vision for the future that I would become this famous storyteller and all these feelings of being behind in life and not being able to function socially would just dissapear.

Then last year in July, I downloaded discord. It started out as a platform so I could talk about stuff I loved. It felt like my prayers were answered. Months went by and I grew more and more obsessed with discord. I started losing interest in my real life stuff. After I started school (it was online due to the pandemic), it just wasn't what I wanted. I couldn't pay attention in class. I found myself bored. I kept looking forward to when I could get out of class and go and talk to my friends on discord. These people felt like my friends. We had stuff in common. It felt like socialization made easy. Hanging out with them didn't feel like the endless circle jerk that hanging out with real life people felt like. I felt for once I had a place where I belonged and it was glorious.

It became my entire identity almost. I lost interest in writing. I lost interest in hockey and ultimately dropped out. I stopped fantasizing about the future. For the months of September through November, my addiction picked up tremendously. I started VC'ing with my friends for all hours of the night. I functioned on 2-6 hours of sleep per night. Despite all that, I felt great. I was happiest I had ever been. No longer did I focus on everyone else being ahead of me in life. It was like a little happy bubble that I didn't want to break from.

Then near the end of November towards December, my friends had talked about wanting to stop VC'ing. I don't know why, but it hurt me so much. I spiralied into a season of depression. From there I felt despair and sadness everywhere I went. I felt like my entire life was a lie how this thing I looked forward to all this time, was now fading away. It was around this time that I realised I had a problem.

I ended up dropping out of school due to this depression. Life was so unbearable that I decided I wanted to go on antidepressents. I purchased a bunch of self-help books.

I decided it was time to get my addiction under control. Long story short, months and months went by and my time on discord shortened. I started no longer feel that need to go on.

Around late December, I found a new TV show. I got really into that and I started a discord for it. After my interest in discord faded then it primarily became a point just to talk to these three or so people in my server.

My depression waded, I felt like my old self again. Being obsessed with movies and TV shows to keep myself sane and to occupy my time because I didn't have any real life friends. I'm still on the antidepressents though because no one wants me to go off of them except for me. They don't work.

My interest in writing hasn't come back though. By now I frusterated because I was out of school and unemployed. I felt like a failure. The only writing I ever did now was I started to write fanfiction for this show I was really into.

I still do that. I'm doing a collab with someone in my server. Now I hardly go on discord except to talk to that person and maybe a few others. It's no longer my entire life. But now I'm 20 years old. I got a job at Home Depot. But the question about what I'm going to do with my life is still puzzling. I regret dropping out of school more then anything else in my life. But I don't want to go back because my writing interest just is not there. It may have came at a bad time in my life or maybe I truely was not interested in it. I don't know.

It's summer now. Seeing people fills me with more despair and I need alcohol just to function in these situations. The other day I fought with my parents and got stuck up in my room for the whole day. All because my sister was going out with her friends and I felt jealous. Summer: The Season of Jealousy. Seeing people have lives and I feel this endless pit of envy. I don't know how I will survive seeing my cousins this summer. One of them moved across the country and lived by themselves for the whole year. The other one now goes to a prestegious school and is already accepted into going to Harvard in a couple years. I'll probably need to be drunk the whole time I see them so I don't cause a scene and delve into that endless pit of despair. I knew my mental health was never good, but now I feel like it's worse then before. I have no interest in anything else. I know I need to go back to school but I just can't help but feel I'm too old. I'd be 24 when I finish and to me that's ancient. I just keep focusing on this year that I've completely ruined.",4,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8324000239372253}"

So it all started with AMC. I made about 15k and then they restricted trading back in Feb and lost about 20k. Then I started day trading my savings and lost altogether from the high about 25k. Then I would play roulette at the casino all the time. I ended up putting 25k into ethereum, sold at 2,300 and bought back in at 3,700 and rode that all the way down to about a 15k loss. I‚Äôm up $8,000 at roulette overall but I know if I keep going back to the casino I will lose it. 
All in all I‚Äôm down about 50k and just picked up a second job as I‚Äôm Active duty still. I want to quit but still see a future in stocks if I play it conservatively. Also I have more than enough savings to continue to lose and lose (I don‚Äôt want to I‚Äôm just stating that I still have enough money to keep playing which is good and bad).

But AA & NA work because they meet the addict where he or she usually is in early recovery: Blind, deaf, dumbed down, and sense-less.","Suggested reading with something other than ""contempt prior to investigation"" or thinking I'm a shill (which should be evident by the time you're done here). 

[New Meta-Study shows how effective Alcoholics Anonymous really is]( https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/11/alcoholics-anonymous-aa-helps-people-stay-sober-longer-study-finds/5008835002/)

AA (and NA and all the other As) work for many because they meet the addict *where the addict is*. Which is very often ***developmentally stunted*** and far from ready to tackle the mental illness underlying their addictions. See [Will the Addict Ever Stop Using SOMETHING if He or She remains Depressed, Anxious or Shameful](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/11/will-addict-ever-stop-using-something.html), especially once those emotions become part of the [Cycle of Addiction](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=cycle+of+addiction+image)?

[Is AA a Cult?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/fi511a/is_aa_a_cult/) 

I went to my first AA meeting in 1977. I finally got the plug in the jug in '84. As culturally blinded, deafened, dumbed down and senseless as I was then (and for many years thereafter), I needed the soft machine around me to keep me from the worst of my incompetence. Which made it possible to plow through of almost a decade of post-graduate school, including years of research into all manner of addictions, the causes of mental illness, cultic mind control and helping victims thereof to recover from it. (See a *comprehensive* -- and free -‚Äì [Online BOOK on How Cults Work](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2020/08/a-free-online-book-on-how-cults-work.html) and how to recover from them.)

37 years later, I relate *to* -- but no longer I-dentity *with* -- the mentality of addicts and alcoholics when they walk into the meeting room for the first or even the 500th time (in most cases). (I've been to more than 10,000 12 Step meetings.) But I continue to appreciate that I am able to do so *because* I worked through a long and very edifying ***process*** of [Re-Development](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/8m565s/redevelopment/)  that would have been impossible had I been unable to get clean & sober.

(Are there *other* ways? Of course. See [Gold-Standard Addiction Treatment](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/12/gold-standard-addiction-treatment.html).)

BUT... bear in mind that I never share any of this in meetings, nor do I go to meetings very often anymore. Because I hear way too much of what Bill Wilson himself warned about over 50 years ago: That sooner or later, the newly sober drunks would turn AA into a religion. (Would I go a [Modern Pentecostal](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/gysbfb/modern_pentecostalism/) church and ask [Is Ardent Evangelical, Fundamentalist &/or Charismatic Xtianity a Mental Illness?]( https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/kd7k8l/is_ardent_evangelical_fundamentalist_or/))

2021-06-15 20:50:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/o0swsz/do_not_abandon_yourself_for_money/,Do not abandon yourself for money,"TLDR: If you have your health, you have abundance. Do not abandon yourself for any money and then do drugs to cope with pain. Money does not add to you and drugs take away from you. You are the most valuable thing that you have. Treat yourself accordingly. You're not desperate for anyone's validation or money. 

This is a lesson I learned with regards to jobs. Money has always been associated with fear and loss and threat to me. I want to remind myself and possibly somebody else to remember that nobody and nothing can threaten you unless you make yourself small. I want you to refuse to fold and rise up. No matter what the circumstances are, life is meant to be good, life is not pain. You weren't born to suffer. Do not punish yourself by giving up on yourself. You do can something good for yourself - even if it's just taking a shower, washing the dishes, listening to music that reminds you of good events. Remind yourself of what made you light up as a child. Allow yourself to feel good again because no regret will change the past. It will only influence the present moment and therefore the future negatively. But you have a choice. You do not have to beat yourself up, please don't. You are not the circumstances, you are not the past, you are not drugs, you are not the pain and you are not the anxiety and not the depression. 

Why do I write this now? Because I set a clear rule for myself to not drink alcohol during benzo tapering. Last night I broke this commitment to myself for what I perceived as temporary gain. There was no gain in what I did other than a lesson. Drugs do not ever benefit you. You are giving away your power to them due to a lack of faith in yourself. But you are able and meant to overcome anything in your life sober and clean. Drugs are nothing compared to your self-worth. You cannot put poison in your body and expect a positive outcome. You cannot destroy yourself into the person you want to be. Please keep your head up and forgive yourself because you are worth it. You don't need to live in agony. Allow yourself to see and feel something positive; I know it is easier to surrender to the pain that is familiar. But that is not a way of living. It neither benefits you nor anyone else.

The past is gone - no denial and regret will change that. You need to find back to yourself again; be only in this moment because that is ALL there is. Dwelling on the past or worst case scenarios in the future will only reninforce those feelings and neural pathways. Force yourself to envision something positive for the future. Write down what you want for your future because this life is yours, you're not a victim of the world. What skills do you want to develop, what passions you want to follow, what interests you? What places do you want to go? I want you to redirect your focus on the opportunity that life holds as long as your heart beats and your lungs breathe.

I refuse to surrender. I've been through too much to give up now. I want to make my life worthwhile. My only fear is to die before I've been able to make a change. No matter what withdrawal symptoms hit me - come at me. Give me everything if that will lead me to a life that is true to me. I just have to believe that my mistakes were not by chance; that they were meant to help me. I have to believe that there is light at the end of the tunnel and that I am getting there even if it does not feel like it. People have done it before. And I will not give up.

I rather suffer sober and aware than on drugs and in delusion because I have faith in myself. What else can I do? My inner true self will always cause me to suffer when I get off course. So I might as well listen to it. And what does it say? Take responsibility of your current situation that was not only created by your downfalls but also by every time you got up again. What makes you believe you cannot get up now? What makes you think that self-improvement is a linear progress? Don't make every mistake your identity. Focus on who you are and what you want to do regardless of the circumstances.

I want you to be rich and stable in your self-trust whether you're dirt poor or things are going well. You are not limited by anyone or anything. You are limiting yourself. How do I know this? Because your true happiness has never depended on materialistic stuff. You can choose to invest into yourself by doing something that lights you up even just a little bit. Even if you have to crawl to get out of your hole, do it. Ya, you don't feel like it, obviously, because sitting in a hole is comfortable. But it is dominated by fear. Not only does it keep you stuck but you sink lower because time goes on while you're dwelling on the past and worrying about the future. Depression and anxiety are not your reality. They're not the whole picture. They're transitory unless you hold onto them. Change is uncomfortable but it happens whether you lay around or get up and show up to your life even when your energy levels are on a negative ten. Choose yourself. Get up for yourself. Forget the world for now. You matter. 

- Write down things that went well
- Write down what you are grateful for
- Write down something that made you smile
- Write down what you want to improve next time
- Write down what matters to you and what does not
- What will matter to you when you die? What will you think of? Money, bad news, drug withdrawal - or the times you were shining and picked yourself up again?
- Make it a goal to create more good moments in your life instead of allowing depression and anxiety to dominate you
- Remember how strong you are. Remember that life is not to break you. Remember that you will not only survive but you will strive. This is your decision.

I have been smoking weed, drinking and doing blow my entire life since my dad normalized it all for me.  (Not blaming him for my addictions, that's just where it started). It all kinda came to a head this past year. I was using oxy, kratom, cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol and smoking insane amounts of weed daily.  I decided to make a change in my life and over This past year I quit all the opiates, then kratom, then amphetamines.  I've cut way back on my cannabis use as well. I did all of this cold turkey, not telling anyone just pure will power.  I've been doing really well but once or twice a week I can't help myself and I go grab coke and alcohol and get fucked up.  I can't seem to put it to rest like the rest of these fucking substances.  Any words of encouragement or advice would be appreciated but really just wanted to get this off my chest.

My last day at the beach I was thinking to myself, ""My mind is actually coming back, I feel a veil lifting."" Fuck, I guess not. 

My main reason in quitting in the first place---fears of brain damage. My memory has become shit. Reading comprehension is awful. At some points it almost feels like I've given myself a combination of dyslexia and ADHD. 

25 days sober and today I feel just as cloudy headed as day 1. I've been eating clean and exercising, as far as my body is concerned the only thing that needs improvement is sleep. Averaging 4-6 hours a night. I'm holding onto this hope that:

Connection with other people.

EDIT: seems some people are confused by this, and it is an elaborate and different concept, so allow me to elaborate a bit.

Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond and connect. And when we are happy and healthy we bond with each other.

When we cannot connect in healthy ways to other human beings because of trauma, or isolation, or because we have been beaten down by life, we will bond with something else that gives us relief. Whether that‚Äôs crack, meth, heroin or something else‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs in our nature.

Let's share stories and encourage each other.,"So. I learned doing Ghb before January of 2020, but back then, I would only dose like once in a while, a dose or 2 every month. Quite enjoyed it especially when used with intimate interaction with a partner lol so cutting the story short, during the pandemic when every country in the world was on lockdown lol Ghb became my go-to ""happy liquid shot"", one reason mainly because no one could go out at that time, I am and will always be a sociable person so going  out, having dinner, brunch, coffee, especially going to the bar with friends and drink - and I mean A LOT! Was my life so then lockdown came like I said, so that's when I learned how to enjoy using Ghb alone and just chill. But I was't dosing 24/7 yet at that time but was using it more frequently.

Come January of this year, I started dosing 24/7 until April, I was feeling the worst effects of using Ghb 24/7 - waking up every 2 hours, redosing just to get back to sleep, extreme anxiety, fast heart rate, bloating (too much sodium in Ghb) and just overly exhausted physically - plus too much money spent on G so I started tapering and it was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life Special mention to my bud ""Dirtbag"" who created a sub on how to taper Ghb properly. 

Anyway, from what I have learned
Phenibut and Baclofen helps a lot with the withdrawals, although I didn't use them to deal with the withdrawals. So the main goal is to stretch out the time of intervals when your are tapering (and this again was taught by me friend ""Dirtbag"" here in Reddit) so I went from dosing every 2 hours, to 3 hours, to 5 hours to not dosing. And I managed to do this in 1 week. The things that helped me deal with tapering were:

WE CAN SHARE STORIES AND ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER.,"So. I learned doing Ghb before January of 2020, but back then, I would only dose like once in a while, a dose or 2 every month. Quite enjoyed it especially when used with intimate interaction with a partner lol so cutting the story short, during the pandemic when every country in the world was on lockdown lol Ghb became my go-to ""happy liquid shot"", one reason mainly because no one could go out at that time, I am and will always be a sociable person so going  out, having dinner, brunch, coffee, especially going to the bar with friends and drink - and I mean A LOT! Was my life so then lockdown came like I said, so that's when I learned how to enjoy using Ghb alone and just chill. But I was't dosing 24/7 yet at that time but was using it more frequently.

Come January of this year, I started dosing 24/7 until April, I was feeling the worst effects of using Ghb 24/7 - waking up every 2 hours, redosing just to get back to sleep, extreme anxiety, fast heart rate, bloating (too much sodium in Ghb) and just overly exhausted physically - plus too much money spent on G so I started tapering and it was the hardest thing I have ever done in my life Special mention to my bud ""Dirtbag"" who created a sub on how to taper Ghb properly. 

Anyway, from what I have learned
Phenibut and Baclofen helps a lot with the withdrawals, although I didn't use them to deal with the withdrawals. So the main goal is to stretch out the time of intervals when your are tapering (and this again was taught by me friend ""Dirtbag"" here in Reddit) so I went from dosing every 2 hours, to 3 hours, to 5 hours to not dosing. And I managed to do this in 1 week. The things that helped me deal with tapering were:

L Theanine Supplement (for the anxiety) 

Magnesium Supplement (for sleep)

Wine (yes, wine lol) but only at night before I plan on sleeping) - helped so much to mask the withdrawals and it made me sleep like a baby.

Klonopin (Benzodiazepine) (just when I was having extreme anxiety)
I only used it twice during the 1 week tapering.

And lastly, a lot of willpower, it's a mental battle as well aside from the physical.

Sad news is that I relapsed but not bad, I started dosing couple of times everyday (compare to dosing 10x a day for 24 hours before) again so now I am trying to get a rest period again.

My boyfriend has been struggling with addiction bad for the last 1.5 years. We‚Äôve been together 3 years and he says at the beginning he was on steroids, then Xanax, then heroin. I‚Äôve never done any drugs. Well, the last 1.5 years have been complete hell for me. More than that actually, because he cheated on me the first 8 months and that messed me up but he said he would kill himself every time I tried to leave. So I realized he has problems and I tried to be there for him because he was my best friend and so we stopped hooking up for a long time and it actually made us closer. So anyway, we both have it bad at home so things were going good with us and we were focused and saved up for a beautiful house together. But after moving in together I saw all these red flags that he‚Äôs hiding a lot of shit and has a lying problem and is always completely fucked up. So I moved out and we broke up. But immediately after he overdosed because he wanted to die. So I felt horrible so I went over there to be with him and it just turned into us getting back together. But he never got clean. He would try and always get too sick so he would lie and act like he was but I knew he wasn‚Äôt. Things were so bad recently that he almost died so many times. I begged him to go to the methadone clinic and he finally did but he was still using and it made him so manic and crazy and I was telling him to calm down and he completely lost his shit on me. He has flipped out on me and scared the shit out of me so many times when I didn‚Äôt deserve it. He said nobody else has a problem with him but me and that I make him want to use. Well nobody else saw him laying there the last year, unshowered, with moldy food and trash laying by the bed. I was just worried about the sudden change in mood. So then I didn‚Äôt hear from him for an hour and he texts me and says ‚ÄúI think we should be friends‚Äù and just says that he‚Äôs going to get clean without me and family comes first and that I was the reason he was using. Apparently he had a talk with his family and said he relapsed after I found out he cheated on me. I‚Äôve been the only one that knew how bad his addiction is and checked on him every hour of the day. He had lost all his friends and only had me. I wanted him to tell his family for support but he wouldn‚Äôt. And now all of a sudden he has his friends and family back and even his job knows but he wants to get rid of me! I know I‚Äôm better off without him and his problems and I always wanted him to get better so I could leave but I can‚Äôt help but feel completely betrayed and fucked over! I‚Äôve been loyal to him for 3 years even after being cheated on so many times. I barely have any friends left that I can even hang out with and I always hurt my family by staying with him. Now I‚Äôm 32 and living at home and I could‚Äôve started my own family by now if I wasn‚Äôt with him. More than anything it just hurts to feel so betrayed. He even said the most fucked up things that I‚Äôm only good for one thing and that he was fucked up when he fell in love with me. I can‚Äôt believe I stayed with an addict just for them to get clean and leave and blame it on me! Btw he‚Äôs only been clean for a week but he really seems like he‚Äôs done and has everyone supporting him now.

so, my boyfriend (M36) has a very addictive personality. we have been together for about 6 months, but we are very serious and are talking about marriage

before we met, for years, he had a really bad gambling addiction to the point where he destroyed his relationship with his family. he got so bad that he was stealing money from his mother‚Ä¶. that was about 10 years ago and he has repaired his relationships albeit a bit awkward sometimes, and he doesn‚Äôt gamble anymore. he‚Äôs really ashamed of his past, and has a hard time opening up about it

that was just some background information‚Ä¶

now he vapes (he quit smoking around a little over a year ago). he said he wants to quit it before the end of the year. for a little bit he quit buying the pods and had cut down on vaping (i‚Äôm not sure exactly all the terminology for these), but after we had gotten into an argument a couple weeks ago he has started taking his friend‚Äôs and constantly smokes them. i watch him and it breaks my heart. the rate he smokes these is about a pack of cigarettes in 2-3 days‚Ä¶. 

we don‚Äôt live together and both are busy with work during the day/most weekday evenings‚Ä¶. and he‚Äôll smoke during our downtime/cuddle time on the weekends (aka the time we finally get to spend together) and if his vape is not charged up he‚Äôll get up and move somewhere where he can charge and vape and the same time. or during any time that we finally get together, i feel like he prioritizes vaping rather than simply holding my hand for example

he also has started to have small coughing fits every now and then, which i know is due to vaping. so i‚Äôm also super worried for his health and the future

he also has a problem with food. he, ever since we met has said he wants to go on a diet and lose 20 pounds. he‚Äôs maintaining his weight bur not really losing anything. he works out everyday, but he won‚Äôt listen to me when i tell him it‚Äôs all about diet. 

on days where we do have time to have dinner together, the next day that we talk he usually always says how he binge ate after we met. or he will try fasting for a day, but then will again binge eat the next meal. 

he eats just to eat, because it‚Äôs a comfort to him when he gets stressed

i want to tell him how this is affecting me and how sad it makes me, but i don‚Äôt want to make him upset or make him fell like i‚Äôm guilt tripping him. i have tried talking to him about good eating habits to help him but he lashed out a bit and said he gets stressed out when i talk to him about food. i can‚Äôt imagine what will happen if i talk to him about smoking. 

these are all habits/addictions he has had for years since before i came into the picture. i don‚Äôt want to make him uncomfortable, possibly trigger him, and have him possibly relapse into something worse. but i hate seeing him do this to himself. especially since we are talking about having a future together with children. he‚Äôs ~10 years older than me, so his health is a big concern of mine in the long term future

i don‚Äôt know how to support him, but i can‚Äôt stay silent for much longer. i feel like if i tell him to see someone it will definitely become a fight, he will obviously be offended, and start vaping and eating even more

My mind completely shut off that period until I was 17 years old then I realized, 'holy shit I was abused as a child'  I kept it a secret from everyone. 

From then on like after I became 8-9 I became gradually addicted to masturbation. it was scarce or occasional at first.  But later both my parents work full time.  And I was alone hence I got into this habit hard.

 Fast forward as a 21yo -> I got this memory problem , addiction, social awkwardness , muscle weakness ,being depressed all the time, lazy, fucked by acne due to harmonal imbalances and some other problems. 

Right now I keep on edging for a long time like 2-4 hrs before the orgasm and then i proceed to jerk off 2-3 times immediately later.  This ritual is done 3 days a week. During the off days , I become completely asexual towards anything in social media.  But when I take 2 days gap consecutively I became this embodiment of horny-ness. My mind completely shuts down my will power to control myself. Until I jerk off I won't be myself for that period.  This is completely fucking with my life.

We used to smoke weed and he always smoked more than all of us in our group, nothing alarming just about annoying at times. 

When we started seeing each other less (we still text from time to time, but it's usually just small talk and videogames, stuff like that) he told me he tried cocaine but ""it wasn't that great, [he] didn't liked it and never gonna do it again"", fast forward a couple of months and I see him again, he tells me that he stopped doing cocaine. I was like ""wait, so you actually started?"". I jockingly lectured him (not actually lecture him, more like ""ew that stuff seems disgusting, I would probably sneeze the whole thing out lol"", don't know if it was actually a wise choice).

The few times I saw him again he didn't mention any drug except weed, but he really looked bad, tired, almost as if he was fading or something, and the first thing I thought was he didn't stop doing cocaine at all. A mutual friend confirmed this to me, and another one just told me he recently did meth.

Now, over the last year I grew tired of this person. I don't have anything against him, I just realized that I'm not willing to accept his faults like I do with my best friends (I'm the kind of guy who has few really close friends who mostly don't know each other) and that I don't want to commit to our friendship beyond the ""funny dude to casually hang with from time to time"". Problem is, I know he must be struggling lately, I know he's fragile (he was depressed and on psychiatric drugs, legally of course), he told me about his attempt at suicide and knowing all this I'd feel bad to just let it go.

At the same time, though, as harsh and egoistic as it sounds, I don't really want to invest time and energy towards helping someone I don't really care about and that could completely stop texting me without me even noticing. He was too much effort even without the drug problems, like when we were hanging out with other people he would suddenly become silent and act like an offended child if he didn't felt like he was at the center of everyone's attention, or if he didn't like the current topic of the discussion, and would sometimes start screaming and arguing that we were bad friends because of this (and if we actually were, we would have dropped him after the first time this happened).

So that's my dilemma, should I help someone who's lonely and tends to push everyone away but that I don't like and who has some toxic behaviors even without addictions, or should I put myself first and just ignore it? Or maybe there's some middle ground I'm not seeing? I thought about contacting someone who's closer to him, but I don't know his current friends, nor his family and his therapist, and I really feel stuck in a situation where it seems that no matter what I do, someone would loose",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993670582771301}"

2021-06-10 22:42:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nx5dfo/for_those_who_hate_the_traditional_approach_to/,For those who hate the traditional approach to addiction treatment and rehab,"Sup everyone, real quick, let me say this...

If you've been around the block more than once and are still struggling with relapsing, or fear of relapsing, then you need to know a few things.

1) there indeed are better, more effective, yet uncommon/unconventional ways to help you permanently free yourself of your habit, to living a life that now may seem like a dream it's so much better than you thought life could be.

2) the current system in place to help those people called ""addicts"" is set up in a way that simply isn't effective for everyone. And for some, it's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole...

It just doesn't work! 

And then when it doesn't work the ""addict"" is the one who feels bad because they ""failed""...which guess what...reinforces their habit more.

Now let me do a quick intro and then I'm going to share an idea that will help you later on if there is enough response.

I'm Andrew, I do coaching using various holistic modalities(i.e. hypnosis and NLP).

My idea is to start weekly group calls over zoom that basically go against everything traditional addiction treatment stands for and belief in.

I warn you, these call will likely ruffle some feathers because guess what...I'm NOT gonna dance around the subject and I'm not willing to see ANYONE as a victim or an ""addict"". 

The perception I have is there are people who(even if they or anyone else doesn't understand why) have reinforced a habit, and made it strong, and that unfortunately, they thought they lost control.

This is because our society has failed them in teaching them as children(YES...AS CHILDREN) to deal with and let go of trauma, and to recognize which habits should and shouldn't be reinforced and why...and more importantly, how to intentionally train your brain/mind/body how to be healthy, strong and in control again.

So in these calls, I'd be sharing insights, running through some processes, asking and answering questions...you name it. Building a NEW belief around ""addiction"" which is that addiction isn't this big bad fucked up thing that it's made out to be...and neither are ""addicts""...

Now...don't get me wrong, I get the depths of darkness that drug(and other habits) abuse can lead to. My cousin who was addicted to meth is in prison for life because he was accused of killing a kid(which he may or may not have done)...yes literally the absolute worst thing someone could probably do...

So I know...

But the point is the current industry is treating addiction as something so much worse than it should be. It's literally a habit, one with triggers, one with a root cause, and one that...like any other habit can be changed.

And people should STOP identifying as their habit...DUDE, you're not your behaviors.

You're much more than you could possibly even imagine...

But in many cases people's abuse of drugs and the formation of that habit people call ""addiction"" is actually linked to some form of trauma early on, which guess what isn't treated in traditional treatment...the root cause of the problem! Why do you think that is?

People and their families literally go into debt, getting second mortgages to send their family to treatment that has a success rate of less than 10-20% in a lot of cases...they do it because they're desperate. Those are worse odds than a flip of a coin. Seriously.

I'm sick of this shit...

People need REAL help...so they can make REAL, LASTING changes...

So they can move forward powerfully in their life.

Anyway...I get a little worked up about this stuff.

That's the state of our medical industry, though. To band-aid issues instead of taking care of the root causes.

So, with that said...

How many of you would be interested in either weekly, bi weekly or monthly calls to support your future success as a healthy, strong person in total control of themselves? LMK in the comments with a ""yes"".

If I get a good enough response I'll start the meetings in July.

Also, please know this is not one of my official coaching programs. They'd simply be an alternative meeting/support group for those on the path to recover from their habit...(not ""addiction"";)",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994788765907288}"

2021-06-10 09:32:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nwnrfb/my_tavels_with_addiction/,My Tavels With Addiction,"Hello,

Let me just say this is my first time posting ever, but I think it‚Äôs time I tell my story. I‚Äôll start from 3 years ago.¬†

It all started with coming home from rehab for pain killer and benzo addiction. I was great for a few months but then I told myself it was okay to start drinking. My family does it every time we get together, my friends do it every time we hang out, and then I started doing it every night. This was right around the time I was about to graduate from my associate's degree in college as well but I had all A‚Äôs as always.¬†

My parents would drink every night and I lived with them so I picked it up real quick and did the same myself. Well, I would start my morning off with baileys and coffee and then go to class. Then I would come home and another coffee and Baileys because it was time to go to work at my job as a server. When I would get back from work all I could think about was my next drink and I‚Äôd pour myself a glass of wine. The next thing I know I‚Äôm in bed with a whole or half of bottle wine in me every night on the weeknights.

I would drink with my friends every night on the weekends, but here‚Äôs the catch, they loved cocaine. Soon enough I was drinking every night and doing cocaine every weekend.

Then I started to get very depressed so I decided it was time to see a therapist. They diagnosed me with depression and general anxiety disorder and put me on a pretty hefty dose of Wellbutrin. Well for those of you that aren‚Äôt familiar with what Wellbutrin does. It‚Äôs a dopamine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (dnri) and well it doesn‚Äôt react too well with cocaine. I‚Äôm an addict so I had no other choice it was all I knew. One night I was out with some friends and we were doing coke but this night was different than any other night. This night changed my life forever. I went down to do the stuff and the next thing you know something changed immensely in my brain. I felt as if I knew something everyone else didn‚Äôt. When the truth is I was having a psychotic break.

3 months later still doing the same stuff still psychotic still have all a‚Äôs still have my job. I was losing my mind and I couldn‚Äôt hold it together anymore. The part that was a breakthrough for me was the suicide note. The one where I was talking about how somebody will come and get me and I‚Äôll never see the light of day again if I told anyone what I was going through. Well, it was either I kill myself or kill my whole family because I couldn‚Äôt control the thoughts and actions that were going through me. Thank God I‚Äôm a critical thinker otherwise I‚Äôd most likely be in prison for a very very long time. After writing my note I read it out loud to myself and I began to cry halfway through reading, I knew I was in hell and that‚Äôs exactly where I was going to end up.¬†

Well, I love my mom very much and I was walking to my bathroom and as I was walking there she stopped me and asked me what was wrong. I didn‚Äôt know what to do but this decision saved my life and I gave her the note. She began to read and I saw the look on her face it wasn‚Äôt disgust, it wasn‚Äôt fear, it was concern. After that, she gave me the biggest hug she‚Äôs ever given me and told me everything is going to be okay and that she loved me very very much.

That day I was admitted to the hospital. Where I spent three days ""coming back to earth"". A few weeks later I finished my associate's degree with all A's. I still was a little out there and was for a year after that because I decide I wasn't going to be on the antipsychotics which would prevent me from using my whole brain to its capabilities. I would have unwanted thoughts all the time. Murderous thoughts about knives and guns but I would never act on them. They caused me sooo much pain, but somehow I managed to fight through it and spend time with the people I love and be the same old me. I was put on gabapentin and an antipsychotic. I continued the gabapentin and continued drinking and occasionally still did cocaine. (<----- Wow this guy is something else) I can't believe I was still doing that stuff. Still playing with the devil is what I call it sorry to bring up religion but that's the only way I know how to explain what was going on.

Since I had just graduated with my two-year degree, it was time for the next chapter of my life. I decided to pursue a degree in cybersecurity at a college in Florida. I left and I was all alone. It was a fresh start. No more people drinking around me all the time. No more friends handing me free cocaine all the time. I was free! My life was changing in ways that made it seem like I was in a whole new world where whatever I wanted for me was going to happen. A fresh start.

I slowed down on the drinking and picked up smoking weed again. I began smoking more and more while I was alone and for some reason, someway, and somehow my anxiety, depression, and unwanted thoughts just disappeared. I began working out daily, eating healthy, and finding each and every way to make myself a better version of myself. Well I eventually got to the point where it was time to find someone that I could spend all of my time with. I was in search of a girlfriend. I was in the best shape of my life and everything was going my way. Then covid-19 hit.

I was forced to go back home and fell back into the same patterns. I thought I would be strong enough but I wasn't. 6 months later I was back doing everything I had done before only this time I was prescribed marijuana so I had slim to no mental health issues. (I truly believe in the medicinal properties of marijuana btw.) During covidcation I felt that I had severe ADHD and went and saw my doctor for it. I got prescribed Vyvanse and then things started to slowly go downhill again. Eventually, I knew I had to head back to school where I could focus on myself and pursuing my degree again.

Ever since covid things have been so different and I couldn't get myself back into the shape I was in. I was stressed out all of the time because classes were getting harder and harder. I was smoking more weed than I ever had, taking my Vyvanse daily, and drinking every night. Then I decided it was time to quit the Vyvanse because it was only hurting me and making things worse. I was then only smoking and drinking. I tried to quit drinking but for some reason, I couldn't no matter how hard I tried or maybe I was just lying to myself. Oh well. I decided I would replace it with kratom and then slowly come off of kratom. Hahaha, that did not work and just made things worse. I started taking kratom, drinking alcohol and doing cocaine, taking my Vyvanse, and smoking all the time. Which led me to where I am today.

Today is my fourth-day sober cold turkey everything and let me tell ya I have so much energy and I am just so motivated to make my life better and turn a new page. I'm also withdrawing pretty damn bad right now, so I figured I would take to Reddit and tell my story to people who have similar stories... hopefully. Feel free to ask me any questions or vent with me this is a judgment-free zone.

I‚Äôm in my 30s. Business owner. Financially fine, in a good relationship and have wonderful children. 

But... after being introduced to cocaine about 6 months ago, issues have crept up on me and I recognise that I need to deal with them. My partner occasionally also does coke (although without the same addictive tendencies as me). I‚Äôve been able to be very open with her and tell her that I‚Äôm experiencing some issues with this. She has been very supportive but also of course needs to see me changing my route. 

It started in a purely social setting on weekend evenings. Friends. Drinks. Some Coke. Great fun. Really enjoyed it. On a heavy night when I wasn‚Äôt asleep until 3, but still needed to get things done the next day, a couple of lines with my partner in the morning, got me going and on with the list of things to do for the rest of the weekend. 

However, pressure at work and being very overloaded with client work (a situation that is now changing as I‚Äôve been in the process of bringing in more staff), led me to taking it at work. Nothing crazy, but sometimes after feeling very lethargic, burnt out and a feeling of not being able to get the energy to crack on with my tasks in the work morning led me to then start doing a couple of lines in the morning at work. This has gone on for some time, and I recognise I have to deal with this issue. 

I‚Äôve tried to go totally cold turkey and I end up feeling extremely lethargic, want to sleep all day with no motivation for anything (doing my bit keeping the house together, motivation to open my laptop and follow through on client projects etc) - and I‚Äôve found myself actively avoiding it and wanting to sleep. Through this, I‚Äôve known that if I just racked up a line the situation would nearly immediately change and I‚Äôd be on my game again - so uh oh - red flag - I have a problem and I need help to get out of it.

Can anyone offer me any tips, advice and/or guidance to put me on the path to fixing this issue? 

I‚Äôve read that some l-tyrosine supplementation could help. I‚Äôve tried dosing 2000mg am and lunchtime but haven‚Äôt noticed any positive changes from it. 

I‚Äôm not religious in the slightest and the ‚Äúhigher power‚Äù elements of 12 step programmes like Cocaine Anon really put me off and I know from reading several articles that 12 step programmes like AA actually have a very low success rate in preventing relapse.

Here is the thing: I am addicted to cigarettes - nicotine to be exact. I know, typically not a big issue, but in my case, it is. About 5 years ago I was diagnosed with Pulmonary  Emphysema (it is a chronic lung condition). It's often part of COPD, a group of lung diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing problems. It develops very slowly over time. I have tried to quit numerous times with different methods: vaping with nicotine, without nicotine, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, slowly, going cold turkey. Nothing seems to work on me.

I am heavily medicated against anxiety due to panic and anxiety attacks and nicotine is like a walking cane in my case. Is anyone going through something similar? Please give me a hand with your comments and support.

I will provide my phone number in case someone wants to help me. The idea is to quit right away but I need someone to be my ""sponsor"", someone who I can text whenever I feel I want to smoke. Is anyone willing to do so? I surely hope someone reaches out. Anyways, my phone number is: +5491164190359 (Argentina). Thank you!

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Okay, this is a long update:

Thank you all for your responses. Some of you know this, some do not (I did not respond to all messages). Nicotine, as I was told by my doctor, is a powerful anti-anxiety chemical. As if this were not enough, if you were to quantify its ""addictive power"" from 1 to 10, it is a solid 10 right next to heroin, even more than coke.

I have been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, depression, OCD, PTSD, anxiety and I do have panic and anxiety attacks periodically. I am already on a heavy cocktail of meds that include Quetiapine, Sertraline, Lamotrigine, Pregabalin, Clonazepam, Zolpidem, and Propranolol. Nicotine is like this additional walking cane to fight back anxiety.

I have checked myself into a drug rehabilitation facility but I could not stay there as much as I should have, I had to get back to work. I did kick the cigarette away but I got right back to it after an intense argument with a former co-worker (my former boss' son).

I have tried Champix, nicotine patches, nicotine gum, vaping with and without nicotine, trying to quit slowly, trying to quit smoking bluntly and nothing has worked. I have been diagnosed with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), namely emphysema and even walking is difficult - sex is a monumental task and I must take Sildenafil (the most common commercial name is Viagra, about four to six 50 mg pills). I am 36 and on the verge of being hospitalized for good due to the severe condition of my lungs, let's keep in mind that this disease has been detected five or six years ago and, of course, advancing, because I keep on smoking.

I have tried anonymous groups similar to AA but but for drugs and they did not welcome me (they think of cigarettes like a minor issue for people quitting cocaine, crack and other drugs) so my problem was ridiculed.

I feel like I am down to two options: either give it a shot to the book you mentioned or just say ""fu\*\* it"" and keep on smoking until shit hits the fan and basically go on my own terms. I must also say that I do have suicidal tendencies and fantasizing about suicide sometimes helps me sleep at night because, even though suicide would mean that I will miss out on the (POSSIBLE BUT NOT CERTAIN) good things in life, it also means that I will miss out on the (CERTAIN) bad things that are to come in the near and distant future (we should also include all my psych issues, loneliness, and economic struggle, among other shit). I just don't have the balls to go through with it. Maybe if I keep on smoking like a champ I will get to ""go on my own terms"" because I am wuss enough to not act on my suicide thoughts.

Yeah, that's how messed up, depressed and overwhelmed I feel currently (when I say currently is not like just today, it is like for the past years until today and most likely in the future).

I feel that just throwing all this here is helpful because I get a lot of things out of my chest but there's a catch: I don't know for how long it is actually going to feel helpful.

Is anyone or has anyone been in my shoes? I am not only talking about the damn cigarette issue, I am talking about the whole ordeal: depression, feeling like my life is a waste, fantasizing with killing myself because it just seems like bliss to take action on that and dodge all negative events that will come in the future, and, of course, the psychological and psychiatric issues that haunt me. I just want a way out and if I cannot kick smoking to the curb, maybe the solution is more like a permanent solution by letting cigarettes chose the moment in which I step out of this world.

2021-06-10 02:06:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nwgid3/simplifying_addiction/,Simplifying Addiction," Addiction disorders/substance use disorders (SUD) are on the rise. However, many mental health care providers have never experienced SUD themselves, leading to higher chances of poor patient care through stigma, judgement, and the misunderstanding of patients. An alternative approach to understanding patients with addictive behaviors using a comparison of sex is discussed in this paper. Since most health care providers will have experienced sex, this analog can help mental health workers with no lived experience of SUD better understand their patients. This can help reduce stigma, misunderstanding, countertransference feeling, and the judgment of patients, thereby leading to better patient care.

2021-06-10 02:02:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nwgg53/to_the_benzo_injured_people/,"To the benzo injured people,","Today marks the 10th year I‚Äôve been on benzodiazepines. About a decade ago when I was 19, I took my first Xanax bar from a friend that had it prescribed after a car accident. He told me the xanax bar would relieve me of all my worries. He was right. I woke up the next day with little recollection of what happened after I took it. All I knew was that after taking it, I had went out of my way to pick up my mom from work, gave her a ride home, and even cleaned my room and my car.
When I saw the reward of being on this drug and how it dissolves any hint of doubt, fear, or uncertainty in my mind, I was hitting up everyone I knew to get my next fix. I paid $5 each, until I found a psychiatrist that agreed to prescribe 30 2MG to me every month.

It didn‚Äôt take long for my tolerance to spike. Within the first year, I began to rely on Xanax for everything. Socializing, cleaning, sleeping, and even breathing. I started to run out of my prescription before the month ended, so when I ran out I had to find vendors online from India and other foreign countries that would send parcels containing 100 pills at a time. I‚Äôve experimented with just about every brand, color and shape benzo you can name. Some potent enough to send me into black out city for days, with others as fake as chalk. My favorite by far, are the 1MG Ksalols‚Äîcleanest and most potent alprazolam produced in Serbia.

1 seizure, 5 arrests, 7 failed relationships, 3 university dismissals and 99 relapses later, I find myself here. I‚Äôm unemployed, and living with my folks at 28. I‚Äôm no more than a shell of the person I was a decade ago, close to unrecognizable if you knew me before the Xanax entered my life. I no longer feel the reward or benefit of this drug. It is now my fuel, my gasoline, and will to live. I‚Äôve come to resent it as much as I rely on it.

By the 5th year came around I was at the peak of my benzodiazepine intake. I was allotted 3MG of Klonopin daily. 1MG upon wake, 1MG in the afternoon, 1MG before sleeping. Looking back, 90 pills of Klonopin a month was lethal for the mind. I wince at the thought of the damage my brain sustained during that time. I don‚Äôt know how I convinced a doctor to give me this high a dosage. Perhaps he felt it was what I needed at the time. Getting off of Klonopin was not unlike a bad mushroom trip. It was full on paranoia, delusions, and distortion of reality. 

Nowadays as I approach my thirties I‚Äôve begun to take my recovery much more seriously, breaking a 2MG xanax bar into fours. I take .25 in the morning, then .25 in the night time. Night time is a must. if I don‚Äôt have benzos in my blood before bed it is almost guaranteed I‚Äôll have visceral, vivid, soul shattering nightmares. I‚Äôll wake up multiple times through the night with the feeling of my vocal chords being strained from screaming, and on the really bad nights‚ÄîI can‚Äôt even move upon waking. I‚Äôd be laying in the dark paralyzed, feeling pure unadulterated terror. I‚Äôll then spend the next day exhausted from having no rest. There is ringing in my ears, I can barely speak, think, or leave the house. Sometimes, I break down and cry for no apparent reason. I feel like I‚Äôm overdosing on emotions, and no one really understands what I‚Äôm feeling. I feel alienated from myself, and everything I once loved.

I‚Äôm writing this as I‚Äôm sitting in a terminal at the airport, worried to death that my prescription won‚Äôt get filled on time at the pharmacy of the city I‚Äôm traveling to. About just how pathetic this is, I don‚Äôt even wanna get into. I just look forward to the day where I can travel and not have this nagging feeling of worrying over where I‚Äôll get my next benzo fix, everywhere I go. 

I need to treat this drug no differently than a toxic relationship. It‚Äôs clear that these benzos no longer serve me. I‚Äôm unhappy and isolated despite having friends and family who still care, and a wealth that continues to provide food and shelter. I have to act quickly, before I lose whatever I‚Äôve got left. The withdrawal is without mercy, and usually the worst part is when jumping from .25 to zero. That jump from something to nothing makes life as I know it, a real life hell‚Äîwith all of my worst fears being discovered. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this feeling on anyone. I‚Äôm left to believe that this must be some sick joke, how hopeless and broken I‚Äôve allowed this drug to render me down to. 

I‚Äôm thankful for this community because it‚Äôs the only place in the world where I‚Äôve found people with whom I can genuinely relate. I‚Äôm rooting for anyone going through similar, and if you happened to read all the way to here I hope this perspective can make you think twice about taking your next benzo. I‚Äôm gonna take one day, one minute, one second at a time until I become who I am again. This is not who I am. To anyone who is struggling or hopelessly addicted like I am, just know, that this painful state of mind is merely an injury of which our bodies will heal itself from. Our bodies are so amazing, with a close to endless capacity to regenerate. The discomfort we are experiencing right now is as temporary as the very drug in our systems which caused this destruction in the first place. I look forward to the day I can share a story of recovery with you.

This resulted in a heart rate of 140 and trouble breathing, and I ended up at the emergency room freaking out. Im only 21 years old but im scared im going to overdose by accident. Besides the last 4 days (which were replaced with opiates) i've been on anywhere between 3-20 grams of kratom. I've been vaping nicotine a lot (disposables) also and was drinking a lot over the weekend (trip to miami). Today my anxiety was off the charts at work, I assume from going cold turkey, and I caved and bought 3 oz of kratom and a nicotine vape. I left the vape at work and the kratom in my car, the anxiety went away some from the kratom but it made me puke half of what was in my stomach, which isn't normal from my experiences with kratom.

I'm at the gym right now after work just trying to find some way to relieve this anxiety. I need to tell my parents and my family so they can support me, but im so scared to admit that i stole meds from my dad again and that I haven't been sober, rather I've been using kratom to deal with my anxiety and depression.

Digging into the science of addiction has been really helpful. Learning that it‚Äôs not addictive personalities etc but it‚Äôs the substance itself that causes the dopamine hit and the need for more.  Some people just sink faster than others. 

When we had to forage for food, and we came across a bush of blueberries, we received a hit of dopamine and felt good. This tells our internal subconscious mind to look for more bushes like that when we‚Äôre hungry, or even to go back to the same place. Weed does the same thing, gives us that hit and teaches our subconscious to keep going back for more for that feeling.

I became a chef manager at my father-in-laws restaurant and had serious backpain. So I went to an Emergency care clinic since I do not have insurance and they gave me a bottle of 10 10mg hydrocodone and this is where it began.. I have been off and on (more on than off) for seven years now. I would get them from my bestfriends mom and aunt who had them prescribed and when my grandmother got them for hip-pain she didn't like them so I asked for them and she gave them telling me to be careful with them. I have almost overdosed twice I believe.. and currently am withdrawing.. I went to my grandmothers last week and she showed me something she got since she didn't like the hydrocodone they gave her tramadol (nasty) and Buronorphine patches 5mcg/hr .. the first thing I thought was oh cool MORPHINE but this is not the case I looked it up and this is a detox drug.. my last oral hydrocodone I took was 6/7/21 at 10AM CST 10MG. I am currently very lethargic and my hands keep sweating.. I am having trouble falling asleep as well. This will be the 4th time I withdraw from the drug.. but what I am confused about is why was my grandmother given Subutex and why did she give it to me right away? It's a 4pack untouched... ive read stories of others addicted to opiates and Subutex and Suboxone helping them much better than methadone to get off completely. I do not want to go to a rehab but I want to stop taking this drug but I need help. I do not want anyone in my family to know besides my brothers who already know I have an addiction to pain pills. I am afraid to tell my wife because she believes I stopped at the start of 2021.

He's also a weed addict. Some people say weed ain't addictive, fair enough, doesn't matter how addictive weed may be, HE is tremendously addicted. He smokes right before work. Imagine being treated by a doctor who's high as a kite. And he keeps smoking all day. He keeps and regularly buys amounts of weed that would get him jailed for years. 

Some time ago, during my teen years, I was proud of his antics, especially of the fact that he is successful despite his partying spirit, used to say stuff like ""the man's just built different"". My friends liked him more than they liked me. Now I realize he risks and sacrifices every single thing for weed. He may be successful at work, but he failed his family. This is a man who I look up to in many respects, but I can't help but feel shame at his drug abuse and its consequences.

One time he even smoked with a couple of my friends (underage at the time). It seems like his priority in life is to have fun despite the consequences. During his birthday a few years ago the cops brought him home because he was asleep in his car on the side of the road, the day after he told me proudly how he had downed a couple of benzos chanting ""fuck the establishment"", and how he'll never have to answer to the law because he's a ""docta"". 

I can't begin to imagine what sort of childhood he had, he's told me his father used to take him to prostitutes starting from when he was 13. He's just been living in pure degeneracy, I can't even begin to comprehend how he has managed to have all that he has. That said, I'm conflicted, because he has provided for us, and showered us with love, but he's got this side of him that constantly disappoints, that's selfish, that's hedonistic and sexually fixated. A married man shouldn't talk about women with his son. I'm tired of pretending these things are normal, I don't want any of this for my children.

How can I help this man? I love him very much and I just want him to be happy without the excesses.

I'm in my late 20's. I've been using cocaine infrequently since about 4 years now. In the last 1-2 years though, it's been pretty much a daily habit. I've recently started to really become aware of how much money I've wasted on it and how it's pretty much the only thing that really motivates me to do things, otherwise I just have little interest or energy to do it. I feel it's become pretty bad. I have used at work, at home, friends house, parents house, step parents house, grocery store bathroom... Just pretty much anywhere, anytime. Mostly at home, while working during the day until night. My girlfriend of 4 years, which I live with, is completely oblivious to my use. Nobody around me knows about it. I'm very good at hiding it and I'm really not sure if my personality has changed or not, but my guess is that it hasn't too much yet since nobody seems to suspect anything. I realise I need to quit before it gets even worse. I make very good money and it doesn't affect my overall financial situation, but using daily really ends up being a lot of money wasted. I'm still able to put a decent amout of money aside and buy anything I need, go out, etc. Nobody knows about it and I feel so much shame just thinking about anyone knowing. I feel tired and bored if I don't use. I feel boring too, like I have a lot less drive, inspiration or initiative. Really just want to get my coke and do a bump here and there whenever I can until it gets late and then it comes crashing down. Whenever I use, I'll also start smoking cigarettes every hour or so or actively seek alcohol. I don't really do those things on their own except whenever I do coke. I'm not getting enough sleep and feel like thrash late at night, when I'm trying to doze off (more like early morning). Its starting to affect my work too. I'm getting more and more lazy, wake up late, projects, tasks, assignments are taking me way more time than usual. Without coke, I just don't feel excited about these things anymore. Even with coke, it's getting really hard for me to stay motivated in between every line I snort. I don't really feel depressed or anything when I don't use, its just that whenever the thought of cocaine comes to mind, I get excited and put my whole day on pause to go get some. Anyways, I really wanted to get this out of my chest first to at least feel like I came clean to someone, to myself, as I really don't have the guts to tell anyone else (and I don't think I ever will). Hoping that by doing this, it will trigger something inside my brain that will help me focus on becoming clean. As of today, I will stop using and put more effort in enjoying what life has to offer.

Any advice or encouragements to help me go through this process is really appreciated.

Each and every ghosting has a different story, but it‚Äôs all the same. I was too strung out to come in, and rather than embarrass myself I took the easy way out. Occasionally I let them know. And it‚Äôs been a few years since I pulled that. It‚Äôs been a few years since I had a major crisis. The last time I was in a psychiatric hospital I thought I was going to hear voices that weren‚Äôt there for the rest of my life. It took 6 months, heroic doses of haloperidol, unbearable side effects, and finally the decreasing dose of Seroquel I‚Äôm on now to consistently think in my own voice again. I am so mentally unstable that alone is a major victory for me. I‚Äôm going to fight the urge to qualify my thoughts by recognizing that others have it worse or that I know I‚Äôm responsible for my misfortunes or any of that. I ask that you accept that as a given. This is my sob story, and I‚Äôm going to tell it with the chaos in which I feel it. I‚Äôm so sick and tired of feeling bad about myself for the things I‚Äôve done and the things I haven‚Äôt done in life. It just feeds into this nonsensical idea to that I belong in a cell or a casket, that I don‚Äôt deserve to enjoy the fruits of life. I‚Äôve been at war with my mental health for over a decade, and it makes me want to shake with tears when I think about the burden I‚Äôve been on my family. I‚Äôm so lucky to have the family that I do and for the opportunities I‚Äôve had in life. I‚Äôm so lucky that every time I picked up the keys when I shouldn‚Äôt have that I made it to my destination. I have had more than one run-in with the law where they had me dead to rights and let me go. I am a gentle and sensitive person. One might even say soft. I‚Äôm not cut out for jail, but they don‚Äôt ask your permission when you break the law. When I saw the George Floyd video, the way he panicked is what I identified with most. I saw an addict who needed help and didn‚Äôt get it. All I‚Äôve ever gotten is help, yet I still struggle to cope. I still haven‚Äôt learned my lesson. I‚Äôm still a slave to my vices, whether that‚Äôs caffeine, nicotine, sugar, and marijuana. I used use meth and Adderall heavily. When I found myself upside down financially last year, I chose to deliver food in a pandemic rather than put the weed down. NPR and my audiobooks gave me constructive things to think about when the right wing conspiracies were actually fucking with my head. My sense of reality is fragile, and it was like an everyday reminder of that. Connecting dots that aren‚Äôt there like you want these horrible things to be true, and it made me so upset, and I have been so insensitive in my response. I wasn‚Äôt trapped in my house last year. I spend very little time there, but when I am home you can trust that I‚Äôm stoned. I watch reruns of shows I‚Äôve seen a million times because I can‚Äôt put my phone down, and 9 times out of 10 I eat myself into a food coma. The entire experience only makes sense through the lens of an addiction that is still alive and well within me.

Sometimes I tell myself I‚Äôm going to start moving full speed ahead next week. Sometimes I think tomorrow will be the day, but it‚Äôs never today. And time runs out on people with that mindset, which is why I‚Äôm furiously pecking at my keyboard in the early morning trying to make these loosely connected thoughts something that stay with me. I still have dreams. I want to get a degree in economics. I want to do a lot of things that my current lifestyle doesn‚Äôt allow me do, and the clock is ticking.

Just plow through it all without thinking you have to take any positions, make any commitments or do anything about it for the time being‚Ä¶ and let the information sort of ‚Äúpercolate‚Äù all by itself.

Withdrawal from *any* form of dependency almost always comes with ***[temporary](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-neurochemistry-of-romantic-love.html)*** anxiety and/or depression.

To dislodge all those old *thoughts* that drone on and on, stick [*this* one](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=it+makes+no+difference+the+band+last+waltz) (from a Martin Scorcese film) into your head and listen *carefully*. If you do, you may see, hear and *sense* that it's about exactly what happens when one first bolts from the bullshit and all the things to whom one has become obsessively *attached* in whatever form of jones that has them by the throat.

And figure that back in the age of sophisticated lyric [metaphor](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/metaphor/), Rick *wasn't* singing about a lost romance with a *woman*. Because he was a heroin addict, Robbie (the guitarist next to him who wrote it) knew that [""Love"" is NOT What We (were taught to) *Think* it Is](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/76p0d1/love_is_not_what_we_were_taught_to_think_it_is/).

With respect to romance or codependency. With respect to drugs or alcohol. With respect to gambling or gaming. With respect to *any* form of obsessive-compulsive belief and behavior with which we have a ""love"" affair. (See Kaggwa's ""[Simplifying Addiction](https://www.dovepress.com/simplifying-addiction-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-SAR)."")

Ask yourself, ""[Will the Addict Ever Stop Using SOMETHING if He or She remains Depressed, Anxious, Shameful & Belief-Bound?](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/11/will-addict-ever-stop-using-something.html)""

So now, we'll move from the (hopefully) artful toward the mundane:

""Drug"" use (regardless of *what* drug) opens up *and* closes down various neural circuits in the brain's [limbic emotion regulation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system)... slowly *remodeling* \-- and re*wiring* \-- that part of the brain where we experience reward and reinforcement long enough to turn it into punishment and imprisonment.

IF we stop ingesting the ""drug,"" the brain will...

1. Quickly (like in a few days), get past the worst of the de-TOXIC-fication, and the seemingly but not actually ""overwhelming"" craving for the short-lived PACI-fication offered by the ""seductive lover,"" and
2. Slowly move back toward the genetically predisposed state it was in before the ""love affair."" Believe it or not, *reverse* [neuroplasticity](https://www.google.com/search?client=avast-a-2&q=neuroplasticity) is possible even in the brains of hard-core speedballers and long-term methheads. (See Ries, Feillin, Miller & Saitz: *Principles of Addiction Medicine* in [A Basic Addiction References List](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/e078lr/an_addiction_references_list/).)

So most PAWS symptoms appear to be psychological in nature: depression, anxiety, sleeping problems etc. This kind of stuff (specifically depression caused by cptsd) is the reason I started smoking in the first place, as a coping mechanism. The last few years I've worked hard on my problems and that enabled me to stop smoking and seek other ways of dealing with my emotions.

I have been feeling pretty down last week in a way that feels less intense but similar to how I used to feel before I got high. When I spoke about it with people they said I am probably experiencing early stages of PAWS but I really doubt it... I think being high all the time limited how much I could grow and heal. I think I am experiencing the leftovers of my original problems. I feel like I have to work through them sober now to fully recover.

My issue with how PAWS is described is that it frames recovery as a passive and automatic process you have 0 control over. As long as you abstain it will eventually disappear is the message I take from it. Is it not going away? Well then, conveniently PAWS can last for years. Just abstain and all your problems will eventually be gone, I promise. 

But isn't it true that most addicts became addicted while trying to deal with other mental health problems? How can we expect people to abstain forever if the source of their pain is never dealt with? Shouldn't treatment focus on helping people deal with life without their addiction instead of just abstaining? 

I feel like a lot of professional help for addiction is very focused on the poison of choice itself rather than the context of a person's life and the most common descriptions of PAWS feel like an extention of that way of thinking. 

What do you guys think?

EDIT: according to literature marijuana addiction can result in PAWS, contrary to what some people are saying. See https://www.addictioncenter.com/treatment/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome-paws/ for more information.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9971754550933838}"

I woke up one day, about 8 years ago, and was sick as a dog. I had shit myself while I was asleep. I was covered in diarrhea from the waste down. I was sleeping in a condemned house with no power, water, food, toilets, nothing. The house was trashed. Let‚Äôs just say, it was condemned for a reason.

I looked around at my surroundings and realized I was covered in my own runny shit. At that moment, I began to cry. I cried like a little kid. I did this for a good 30 minutes before I finally got myself out of bed and cleaned myself up. Continuing to cry while I was wiping the partially dried shit off my legs. 

I was defeated. I was at my rock bottom. I just wanted to die. That morning was one of the darkest moments of my life. 

I pulled myself together after a while and realized I had only two options. I‚Äôm either gonna die or I‚Äôm gonna stop using heroin. 

I had an epiphany that day. I decided I was done. I never wanted to use heroin again. 

I was in rehab the next day.

I spent about 3 months in treatment between rehab and a halfway house. There were two things I took away from my time there. 

First, I couldn‚Äôt go back to the city I was using in. I had to find somewhere else to live. Second, I had to change the way I think. I had to totally rebuild my outlook on my life. I had to completely change my mindset.

So, I did.

I moved 3 hours away. I couldn‚Äôt get drugs even if I wanted to. I knew nobody where I was at. I ended up getting a job and started building a routine like a normal person. Over time, this lifestyle began to become sort of my new habit. It was all I did during that time.

Throughout this time, I worked on that second part. I started thinking differently. I started thinking positively. I started changing my entire mindset about life. Eventually, my way of thinking changed entirely.

I stopped craving drugs. That empty void inside of me began to fill up with something. Something that I hadn‚Äôt felt in a very long time.

Hope.

It was around this time that I new I could actually beat this thing. I could stay clean. I could be fucking normal!!

All these years later, I‚Äôm a completely changed man. I‚Äôm a father, a husband, an uncle and I‚Äôm a contributing member of society.

I have a career that pays me nearly 6 figures a year. I have a life again.

*I have my fucking life back.*

Today, I have no desire to use drugs. There‚Äôs no disease lurking in the back of my mind waiting to jump out like the bogey man. There‚Äôs no constant battle going on in my head. There‚Äôs nothing except the desire to live my life.

The desire to be a father, a husband and a man. The desire to raise and provide for my sons. The desire to be the husband my wife deserves. The desire to be normal. The desire to be free from addiction.

Today, I am free.

The addict in me died that terrible morning all those years ago. I am no longer an addict. There is nothing in this world that will ever make me want to use drugs ever again. There is not, and never will be, any desire to use drugs in my mind ever again.

You can be free too.

Thing is, how can you beat this thing called addiction if you convince yourself that it is a battle that isn‚Äôt winnable? 

I won the battle. My enemy was addiction and I beat it.

You can too. You must first believe that you can win.

Because you can!!

2021-06-07 06:03:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nu8q12/this_has_to_be_it/,This has to be it.,"Right now I am sitting in the methadone clinic waiting to do my intake and get clean. Again. I have done this in the past and gotten clean. I relapsed and got on it again, quit methadone cold turkey after a few weeks and I was clean for a good while. Relapsed again, went to jail dried out there and said I would never do this crap again. First day out I OD‚Äôd in my dads driveway. 

So why am I here today? Let me put it like this. The mother of my son is also my partner. Well, was I guess. We do our DOC together. We have been talking about getting clean again and she was on methadone as well with me both times. Im not blaming her for my shortcomings but whenever we arent together I only want to do better for myself. Together all we do is fight and argue over literally everything and that is not an exaggeration. I do love her but it just isnt worth it anymore to deal with the constant drama. One thing we agreed on is for her not to do Xanax anymore because she acts insane on it and is completely forgetful. I am completely against it for this reason. She chose to sneak and do it knowing that every time she does it puts our relationship and living situation in extreme jeopardy. I am over it. I gave her the choice to go to sleep or leave multiple times between arguing over everything and her wanting to smoke a cigarette, forgetting everything that she did, then she will go lay down with me. 

We did that dance literally 7+ times until I finally had enough. Leave. Go. I cant do it. 

I love her but I need to be better for me. I believe she would have gotten clean with me again but the constant drama is too much for both of us and I cant take it anymore. 

I hope she does okay for herself but it cant go on like this. I hope this time I stay clean and keep my life on track for my kid and me. I wish she would have stopped being crazy and went to bed but it just wasnt happening. 

It took about an hour and a half to type this out between taking a piss test and filling out paperwork. They just called my name. This is it. Wish me luck.",18,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9916719794273376}"

My mother died 5 years ago but I feel like taking advice that someone would give my mom will help me more than someone giving me advice meant for me.

(Me pretending to be my mom asking for advice)
Hello all! 45 year old Mom here. I have a son who‚Äôs 18M that‚Äôs going through some scary mental health and substance abuse issues.
His father had a lifelong problem with alcohol. Constantly in and out of rehab. He wanted to quit but couldn‚Äôt control himself. He physically abused me and was not there for the children, I had to divorce him. He committed suicide in 2013 when my son was 10 and daughter was 12. 
Later on I was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2015, I had my surgery and on May 20th, 2015, i would pass away and leave my children orphaned. 
I am now in heaven watching my son go through the exact same things his dad did. He cannot control himself with weed and nicotine. He is by himself 24/7 and drugs are the only gap he has in life. All of his happiness is artificial. 

(back to writing from my perspective)
My father had nobody in his life to help him with his alcohol problems. His parents weren‚Äôt there for him and all he had was his brother. It was not enough and he ended his life.
Now I look at my life. I have no parents, just like his parents weren‚Äôt there for him. I have no friends, my dad had very little friends. I am extremely addicted to weed and nicotine, my dad had these identical behaviors with cigarettes and alcohol. I have desire to quit but cannot go more than a few weeks or a couple months before relapsing and smoking 24/7. My parents have passed and all I have is my brother, who‚Äôs not enough. Just like my dad.
I understand now why my dad took his life. I didn‚Äôt understand until I started having addiction problems. It makes me wonder how he made it all the way to 46 dealing with the things I‚Äôm dealing with now. 

I understand that people argue weed isn‚Äôt addicting. Although I may not be chemically dependent on the drug, it‚Äôs all I have to fill the gap in my life of not having my parents or friends or anybody to talk to. My brother downplays my substance abuse and thinks I‚Äôm just getting high because I wanna get high. I don‚Äôt abuse drugs because I want to get high, I abuse them because it‚Äôs the only thing that replaces the things I‚Äôve lost and the lack of social contact I have. This is not who I am. This is not who I want to be. 

If weed is fucking me up this bad, I can‚Äôt imagine what my dad went through doing this on alcohol and if I ever touch any harder drugs after that, I‚Äôll just prepare to die right then and there.

I‚Äôm just so scared I‚Äôm gonna end up like my dad because I‚Äôm already dealing with all this from ages 14-18 and I can‚Äôt keep going down this path. My dad was still smart and successful in his life but his addictive personality was too much for him to overcome.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9797887206077576}"

It nearly cost me my diploma in highschool and I suffered with lots of depression and social anxiety, something I've always experienced but weed amplified in the long run. I also became curious with other drugs like stimulants, alcohol, xanax, etc. and I feel like a wasted a lot of brain cells throughout highschool.

Still I somehow manage to be a good kid now at 19 doing good for myself but drowning in addiction moreso than ever. I've been to rehab 3 times but everytime I come out I keep falling for my addiction voice and end up getting worse and worse everytime.

I keep smoking all day everyday, needing a lot of caffeine to function (and am still tired), puff nicotine off my vape to an insane ammount, and keep relapsing on speed every 2 weeks or so.

I have to keep this great job I just got and I'm doing good at work so far even though I can tell my brain is loopy and foggy from all the drugs I've done.

It still seems like weed is my main addiction because everything else I can abstain from for some time but weed is always there waiting for me and I hate it!

Weed is making me foggy, can't think straight, depressed, anxious, loopy, impaired learning, impaired social life. My speed relapses keep adding up and doing numbers on my heart and body and mind as a whole. And I have a super bad pmo addiction and when I relapse on speed I end up watching hours of porn in one night while smoking up an insane ammount of weed and nicotine and recently even a lot of alcohol.

Now I'm starting to drink on top of all these other things and I can see myself slipping.

Just a little over a month ago I got out of rehab 2 weeks sober feeling great, healthy, in shape, productive, and like I was starting to become me again.

All it took was one mistake.

I guess I'm gonna go walk to the local nature perserve and try to enjoy the day since I've been depressed all weekend and haven't left the house except for when I need to.

Everytime I quit I always go out there, throw out all my paraphenalia in the trash can, and walk away and try to enjoy nature.

I have a bad habit of being so hard on myself that I basically set myself up for relapse. This time I'm gonna be easy on myself and be understanding of this withdrawal which is really just a detox I'm going to experience.

I'm 19, I can't waste my life on drugs like my brothers who were in an out of prison.

And honestly it all starts with weed for me.

Once i smoke weed I get bored with it and want to move onto other things on top of smoking.

And before I got into any other drugs I knew I wanted to quit weed and porn because it was already bringing me down even at 14.

Haven't posted on here since last year but occasionally I browse posts. I don't get that same spark of hope I use to when browsing here, idk why. So I'm j gonna try to get sober so I can share my story and hopefully inspire others.

I like to make music and am learning a new job so this will be hard because I'm not gonna enjoy doing the things I like and learning things will be more frusturating espeically w hard labor but I'll get thru it.

Quitting weed, nicotine, caffeine, porn, and staying away from any and all stimulants.

For some reason I always go Cold Turkey. That's the only way that works for me. My longest streak is 30 days for the last 6 years. I'm ready to reach that milestone and go as far beyond it as I possibly can in order to achieve the life I want.

I'm tired of smoking weed and getting inspired by thinking of my dreams and aspirations and dream life but laying around depressed watching youtube playing video games, watching porn, never doing anything about it. I'm ready to be sober. And instead of being in a stoned stimmed daydreaming haze all day, I'll be out there REALLY accomplishing the things I want to do.

And my mind body and spirit will thank me and reward me for this change in lifestyle.

It's time again!

No more doubting myself and saying I'll quit tommorow or f""ck it,

It's time to get serious and make this change now. Today. Right now!

Hopefully I can inspire others on this journey weather your long into it or just at the starting line like me. Because I've been lacking in that spark of inspiration but I'm just gonna do what I know I've gotta do no matter how I feel!Have a nice day everybody",17,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9916806817054749}"

I have never had an addiction or dependency to anything for the 36 years I've been alive. For over 2 months I've had a real hard time with sleep due to intense anxiety, and have tried many sleep medications from nightquil to trazodone to Ambien to Lorazepam. The most successful of which has been lorazepam which was first prescribed to me in mid April to help with my health and sleep related anxiety. I took one to two pills every night for sleep over maybe a week or a bit longer. Didn't have a refill and needed to wait over a week to try and have more prescribed. Over the past 2 months and a bit the drug of choice has been lorazepam and over the past 4 weeks have been taking one to two pills daily for sleep. 

My concern is becoming dependent on the drug. I was told by my doctor that benzos are habit-forming but was ignorant to what that exactly meant. I just assumed it meant it causes cravings (which I certainly do not have, in fact the total opposite - I want off the drug) and not that the brain will demand it in order to function. 

I've been treating my anxiety for about 1.5 months with escitalopram which has been very effective but I still seem to struggle falling asleep with anything else but lorazepam. I read these horror stories and it has made me very frightened about what might come of me if I continue to use this drug daily. Yesterday I decided I will not take anymore than 1.5mg for sleep and am hoping that I can cut that down to 1mg a night (not every night I've needed 2mg and no matter what i will not make the leap to 2.5 - 3 or more mgs.) 

Can anyone with daily lorazepam (benzo) use share their experiences or provide any advice as to what I should do? Is there another medications less harmful that may help with my sleep?

2021-06-05 13:41:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nt12j4/dealing_with_social_media_addiction/,Dealing with social media addiction,"I'm proud to say that I've managed to get rid of my facebook and youtube addiction, and I'd like to share my experience and how I did it.

First of I'll start with something that didn't work for me whilst quitting youtube:

Limiting my time on youtube.

And setting a schedule of when I should watch youtube.

I must say, that escaping these addictions is one of my greatest achievements this year.

But how I did it may surprise you:

Let me start of with the hardest of those two; Youtube.

The first step of Quitting Youtube (and later Facebook) demands just a little bit of will. Not a hole lot, not a metric ton of power, just that ever so slight amount needed. But what exactly do you have to do?

You'll need 2 things:

This chrome extension

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en)

This extension, will get rid of all your youtube feed on the browser. Quite amazing.

However this is not enough. You shall also need a new google account, just for the sake of not getting all those notifications from youtube.

For the moment, you will not use it on the phone too, because you are trying to stop your browser addiction.

You may, if you feel the desire to watch youtube on the mobile, as much as you wish. However, it's important to get used to not using the computer for that purpose.

Stop the watch history, and search history.

[https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/95725?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/95725?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en)

Now you have to wait, about 2-3 weeks to keep getting used to not watching Youtube on the browser. Ideally is to work on the computer, and put the phone somewhere you cannot see it, for instance behind the screen, or on the bed, behind you.

The first few days will be rough, I have to be honest. I barely resisted. But then, you can always watch on the phone, for now at least.

And now that those 2-3 weeks are over, you'll have to get to the rougher part of this: Getting rid of youtube. You'll start gradually:

in the 4th week you'll stop the phone notifications from youtube. You shan't see anything coming from it. Look it up. It's not hard to stop the notifications.

About 2 weeks later (that's week 6) you'll have to disable youtube (you cannot uninstall it, idk why).

For me it wasn't so difficult. I actually didn't feel the urge to watch youtube on phone when I decided to do it. It may be different for you. But do your best not to reactivate youtube, after deactivating. Sincerely.

If you reenable it, you'll have to start from week 4 again.

You'll see it's getting easier and easier with the time. I can say from my experience, that the hole process takes from start to end around 8 weeks. (It may or mayn't be faster, depending from the case to case).

The more cumbersome you feel the pain is, the better it will be in the end.

Do NOT use the browser (on the phone) to watch youtube. NEVER. You may use the computer, using the new account, if absolutely needed (for tutorials for the job, or maybe (if you don't have spotify) for music, but I'm not sure it's recommended)

Anyhow.

How how do get rid of Facebook addiction.

First step:

Create a new facebook account, and you will not follow any new friends, besides those of which you don't have the Whatsapp number. Just don't do it. Trust me. For now you will use facebook only in order to communicate.

NEVER EVER HAVE more than 40 friends on facebook.

Step 1.5th

Every time you notice a new post on facebook snooze that person for 30 days. After about 2-3 days you'll notice that you have no facebook feed. That's great.

Repeat this step indefinitely.

Second step:

You shall uninstall facebook from your phone. You ought to use the browser instead.

Get used to this. It may be painful, but it's a necessary step.

Third step:

On the computer use this browser extension, in order not to have any newsfeed:

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en)

Stop any notifications you get either on the phone, or on computer from facebook.

Unfollow everyone you follow on facebook, not to get any notifications.

Now you wait. A few weeks (around 3-4 weeks, during which you can start quitting youtube)

Don't reinstall facebook, don't use the old account, do as I say.

You will notice that you spent less and less time on facebook. It's getting boring. No feed to read, no memes, no notifications. Just plain facebook messenger.

Step 4th:

Install this extension:

[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocksite-stay-focused-co/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/blocksite-stay-focused-co/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh?hl=en)

It will allow you to force you to stop using facebook on desktop browser. Don't activate this until you feel comfortable using facebook only for messaging.

add facebook to the list of this extension and use the ""Disable account"" feature of facebook.

It will kick you off facebook for about a month.

Congrats. You just quit facebook.

I used to be dependent of instagram too.

I could share my experience of quitting it if anyone desire.

I am moderately proud of myself for writing this, I've wanted to for months. I've needed to for months. 

August 2019 was when I first shot meth.  I don't feel like touching on my use prior to this, as most of it was relatively harmless. 

It's crazy because I remember the first few months, i would only do a shot per week afraid of it consuming me. I managed that for a few months... ended up losing a job and everything's been in free fall since then. I slowly give in to the IV lifestyle and I've been watching everything slip away that I love...and it's scary. 

Court next week for a 5th degree and I haven't even told my mom or sent the public defender form back. Fuck. First offense... I want be a nurse practitioner someday. A felony would prohibit that.

Here's the only good thing i have on my side. I've been in psychiatric treatment for SUD/Major Depressive Disorder and severe ADHD since I was 12. Yes, it does suck that i could literally give give a profile of every med they had me on (every. Single. Psych med. Not kidding.  Except maoi's hell no) but I have found anti depressants a key role in my wellbeing. 

Had a brief stint with TMS for my depression a few months ago. It was amazing, I could literally feel myself returning back to life. I could feel it unwiring what I've messed up. 

I should also mention all that psychiatry did pay off, I've been seeing a brilliant psychiatrist for over a year now. I get ketamine nasal spray, benzos if needed and I'm prescribed Desoxyn. This is the perfect recipe if I could just put the damn needle down. 

100% abstinence isn't the way for me, please don't preach that if you leave me a comment. Before my sister died last December (age 26) she had 4 years clean from heroin. She drank a little here or there but she got her life back when she put the needle down. She went so hard with heroin qshe had to have a routine hip replacement at 26. That procedure took my sister away..

I miss her so much sometimes but I know I'm meant to be here. I was in a car accident  (how2attachaphoto?) I shouldn't have survived but I walked away without a scratch. 

I've already been to treatment 6+ times as well. I have all the answers... it's like I'm just waiting for the right moment or sign to Kickstart my journey back to myself.

I started dating my current partner around 23 and was still actively partying. I finally managed to get clean from heavies but still blazed.

Everyone is always home for various reasons so it's eclipse level rare that I'm alone. Recently i found myself with an evening to myself.. 

Almost right away the cravings hit me like a truck and i became intensely aware of a stash of shrooms iv had been sitting on for nearly a year. Before i knew it i was weighing them out and preparing a glass of water, a tab to my local headshop already open on my phone cuz you cant do shrooms without weed. I even started wracking my brain for mdma hookups thinking i might as well go all the way. As i driving to get weed i managed to reel myself back from the edge with a compromise, I'd get drunk instead! (why that was any better i have no idea).

I got shitfaced and struggled with a migraine for 2 days... 

This obviously scared me. It was so easy for my mind to fall right back to old habbits. Have i even made any progress or is my sobriety solely reliant on people being around to hold me accountable? Can i even hold myself accountable, no i cant? Fuck. 

I know this is long but thanks if you made it this far. Why this is so scary is that for reasons unrelated to drugs my partner an i have decide to separate for a short time. We planned on building each our own tiny home on some land gifted to my partner. We build hers while she saves money at her parents who's house is next to the land and I'll get my own apartment until I'm ready to build mine.

my parents know im a drug user and have done for around a year. the day after my 16th in march i got caught with 7 vals in my school uniform stumbling around and hiccupping. police got involved and they only just closed the case a few days ago. ive been involved with drug counselling services in my area, wont get into specifics because i dont want to doxx myself. they (my parents and drug workers) all believe im clean at the moment.

ive told myself and others i was getting clean multiple times in the past. and i never did because i never fully believed i had a problem. i have the ket thats left over and im not sure what to do with it. i could shot it but morally i wouldnt want to do that. i could give it back to my dealer. im not sure. but right now its sitting on that vodka bottle in the drawer waiting for me. i need to tell my dealer to stop shotting to me but ive asked him to do that multiple times in the past and it hasnt lasted. 

ive posted on here a few times in the past asking for advice which i knew i would never follow and for that one im genuinely sorry. i wasnt gonna commit to getting clean if i wouldnt accept i had a problem.

im at a point where i do genuinely want ket out of my life forever but its turned into a full on addiction and i rly dont know how to do shit sober. the way my mind works is centred around ket. whenever i get money im instantly calculating how much my dealer could do for that. when im at home im constantly doing ket and when im not all my thoughts revolve around when i can go back to my room and get more fucked up.

i fucking hate it. i hate that im known in my friend group and my school for being the ket addict. when im in group chats and ppl chat shit about ket im always the one who wont shut up abt how yh!! ket is the perfect drug!!! i love ket so much!!! when in reality i fucking dont. i dont know how to get out of this. any advice would rly be appreciated.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992576241493225}"

 Ive been to the hospital like 7 times for severe alcohol withdrawal with delerium.

So I initially started on GBL to make my life easier, im a really closed person when you meet me at first, and i struggle with social anxiety. So I did it to be social, and to get out the house more, since its really a wonder drugs for that..

But anyways, this is about my GBL addiction now, i know that both, benzodiazepines, alcohol and GBL(GHB), goes to the GABA receptors, and ive been using GBL for around 3-4 months, 24/7 now. Every 2-3 hours i dose 3.5ml to not feel the light withdrawal symptoms like anxiety, sweating, heart beating fast, and the needles on the skin kinda feeling (dont know how to describe this), i even wake up at night multiple times to dose, with massive cold sweats, bed drenched in sweat.
i dont even get high of it, i just do it to not get the withdrawals, also i get very sleepy, i fall asleep the weirdest places and times of the day, my friends i live with question this, since they never did any drugs. I just tell them im tired and my social anxiety meds make me sleepy..
 Im afraid that when i run out i will go into delerium again, because the nurses and doctors told me, everytime you go into withdrawals from alcohol or GBL, it gets worse every time. And ive seen that with my own eyes, at first it was very real-like dreams and loops, got stuck in these scary dreams where i saw these crazy jump scares, over and over and over. Then I started going into delerium seeing my father got shot in the head and i got chased in the woods, i know i was awake, but these extreme psychotic episodes and hallucinations feels too real to comprehend.. 
 So I really dont wanna go through it again, since it will just get worse. And it tears on the body and mental(brain) too..

 I really cant afford to be away from school or i will get kicked out for not being there. Or from work, then I get no income for rent and so on. So I cant go to the hospital again for so many days it takes me to be off of it.
 Is there a way to get out of this myself without getting hooked on benzos? I tried to do 3-5 valium before sleep but thats not even enough, i wake up after a few hours and i need to dose GBL, because im FULLY AWAKE and restless, and anxiouty starts kicking in.. and since when ive been to the hospitals with alcohol withdrawals i needed up to 1200mg of Klopoxid(Chlordiazepoxid), 5 valiums wont really do much anyways.. and I cant get them from the black market here, its even more expensive than the GBL itself..

Please... thanks in advance",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9980819225311279}"

My friend, 22 female, has been on about a 4-5 month bender with cocaine. It took ahold of her pretty quickly and last week she spent about $400-$500 on it. She‚Äôs been off cocaine for about 48 hours and has had withdrawal symptoms. While these have been going on she has been trying her ass off to find a rehab place to go, but here‚Äôs the hard part, many are saying they are not equipped to deal with the mental illness side of her addiction and want her to go to in patient psychiatric care instead. She has had suicidal ideation in the past (not currently and is taking medication) she also has borderline personality disorder (also taking medication) and has a history of self harm. I‚Äôm not a professional, nor do I have a history with addiction or mental illness but I think the substances are a big issue that is causing a lot of current mental issues with her. She is so sweet, kind, smart and trying her ass off to get the help she needs but she will not go to a psychiatric ward under any circumstance and only wants to go to rehab. Is there any advice on how to answer questions on the pre-screen? I may be asking a horrible question but I just want to help her because she has been trying extremely hard to break this addiction and she doesn‚Äôt know how long she‚Äôll last without help from a rehab facility.

I couldn't sleep anymore, lying awake at night even though I was dead tired. I cried and it shook me, I sweated and froze at the same time. My nose was running and my head ached, while I wasn't hungry, even though I was so hungry. How was I supposed to go through life without him? And then the justifications started. I heard him talking to me - like a violent, abusive ex-partner I kept wanting to go back to. 

It wasn't all bad after all. Sure, the last few years weren't going so well. But in which relationship does it always run smoothly? We love each other! And back then, when he was so good to me - we had the time of our lives. That's how it felt then and that's what I thought then.

Even today, sometimes those thoughts come back. And with them the desire to mend that lost love and strong bond. And I have to resist again and again. 18 years we went through life together. Through the good times and the bad, together we had experienced the greatest happiness and the deepest sorrow. The death of our father, the loss of so many partners, but the most beautiful parties and the wildest nights as well. 

But I know it is not permanent, what is promised to me there. The happiness I might experience is wooden and rotten inside - like a rotting tree squeezing out a last branch doomed to die. The relief and relaxation I'm promised lasts a few days at most, after which comes the hole. And the craving. Because once he's back, he won't let me go so quickly, he promised me that.

However Prior to him going to rehab he was always expressing to me the burden of guilt he had for always relapsing and for not being able to give me what I deserve. This man was an amazing boyfriend other than his devastating battle with addiction to cocaine. He had an extremely traumatic childhood and would use to numb his trauma. He would use cocaine alone in his bathroom In binges and exclude himself from the world and then would feel so so much shame and guilt. He was in rehab for 3 weeks back in January and he came out with so much positivity and excitement to be and stay clean. From early February to April I didn‚Äôt see him much when he was clean because of some family issues I have going on at home. He was trying so desperately to repair our relationship and always constantly trying to see me and reminding me how much he loved and missed me 24/7 with calls and endless texts and showing up to my home with flowers etc. it was amazing but at the same time I wasn‚Äôt able to give him the full attention and love he needed at the time because of the stress I had been dealing with my family. Fast forward to April 20th when he relapsed. It was devastating for us all and he went on a 4 day binge until he checked himself right back into rehab. He was there for another 3 week stay and came home on may 17th. The day before he came home he called me from rehab and told me we needed to talk and that he was suffering from the guilt and putting me through the constant relapsing. I advised him that maybe it would best that we separate so that he doesn‚Äôt have this guilt. He seemed taken back a bit but also on board with the decision . When he came home from rehab I saw on his call log that he began having a lot of communication with a female (I suppose this is someone he met in rehab or possible right before as I never noticed the number before. I asked him about it and he said it was just someone also in recovery. Fast forward a week later, he admits he has feelings for this person. He calls me once every other day or every morning to just say hi or that he misses me and us. But I am just confused how he could have feelings for someone else and also be okay with letting me go.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9928321838378906}"

2021-06-01 07:15:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nprjty/when_everything_falls/,When Everything Falls‚Ä¶.,"I am 21 days sober in less than an hour. I recently checked myself into detox to kick heroin and meth. I knew I couldn‚Äôt stop on my own and I didn‚Äôt want to lose my family. When I started this run at sobriety I had a girlfriend that I had been with for 15.5 years. We have 2 kids together, we own a house and vehicles together. I have been struggling every day this time and I have been open with my AA/NA friends and my girlfriend because I wanted this to be my final time kicking and I wanted to spend the rest of my life focusing on growing my family. I am in meetings every day. I went to three meetings today because of the holiday. I share in meetings and I am open about my struggles. I reach out to people from the fellowship throughout the day to stay grounded. I have been going back to the church we attended pre Covid and pre relapse. I have been going by myself because I need to change. I emailed the pastor a long email about why I haven‚Äôt been attending church and about how I struggle with heroin and meth. We‚Äôre going to dinner on Wednesday to talk even more in depth about how I can get better. I really thought that even though it has been painful, that I was making progress and that my family could hold their heads up high. After my second AA meeting today I came home. After 15.5 years, my girlfriend left me. She gave me the news while she got ready to go meet some guy for the first time. Talk about a guy shot. My heart was shattered and she left me curled up in a ball weeping uncontrollably. A piece of me died today. I didn‚Äôt use somehow but I also have no will to be alive anymore. Love is fake and I spent my entire life thinking I could spend my life with her and that we would fight for eachother. I lost my life today and were sleeping in the same bed right now. I have to hear her sleeping peacefully while I lay wide awake. I have to run out of tears eventually. I have work in the morning and I haven‚Äôt slept and I am an emotional wreck. I need to put my trust in God and wait and see where this leads. It hurts now but hopefully it‚Äôs for the bigger picture",29,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6851918697357178}"

It‚Äôs gotten pretty out of hand at this point. She has two young daughters and a boyfriend. But she‚Äôs so deep into the drug, she lives in a hotel with her dealer and fellow abusers rather than going home to them. She maintains she can handle recovery on her own rather than seeking treatment of any kind. But she‚Äôs shown absolutely zero signs of slowing down. Admittedly, this has taken a huge toll on myself mentally and emotionally. Because I‚Äôm watching someone I love go down this path of self destruction. And there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it but wait and hope she eventually chooses to get better. I‚Äôm just curious if there are any other folks who dealt with a similar situation, how did you manage your health? I‚Äôm not doing so well. I don‚Äôt eat or sleep much. I don‚Äôt attend the gym as much as I previous did. I‚Äôm way more anxious than I‚Äôve ever been in my life.
