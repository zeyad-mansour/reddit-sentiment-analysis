What has been most helpful for you? What are some barriers you've encountered? What would you want an advocate to do for you?

I have a close family member that I’ve watched experience tragedy after tragedy in the last 4 years and has turned to Xanax and many research chemicals including Etizolam. I have had many conversations to try and address the issue in many different ways but with the pandemic everything has progressed rapidly and is out of control. I’m really afraid of losing them and there are literally almost a thousand tablets of Etizolam tucked away throughout our house. I’m afraid to approach them because now it’s become a heated topic and they often will leave and be gone for hours but threatening to take their things and leave although they don’t have anywhere to go. I’m genuinely worried because we threw everything out together after a good conversation about it about two months ago and now I’ve found and endless supply. I know they won’t be willing to go into a program and with their suicidal thoughts they have expressed I’m afraid if I approach this the wrong way it will end tragically. I’m really open to any help or incite anyone has to offer, I hate watching someone I love feel the pain they do but I hate it more to see them go down this road. I will note that after some research I know that there are some that say Etizolam is a better substitute for benzos and can help people in controlled doses and time periods but in this case it’s been large quantities and large doses for a few years.",1

I’m writing here simply because I’m so filled with anxiety, shame and fear that I’m unable to share this with anyone close to me. I’m terrified of seeing the reactions people close to me would give me if they knew what I’ve done. 

I lost over $60,000 in the last 6 days playing online blackjack. Almost my entire liquid savings account. I have a great family, new relationship, a good stable job, just moved into my first apartment on my own. I am 27 years old. I have played blackjack for about 6 years now and never once did I think I would let myself come anywhere near doing this. I actually stopped playing online blackjack for 2 months because of a big miracle win where I was counting my lucky stars to have come out ahead. Swore I’d never play again and delete the app but I never deleted it. This past Saturday I decided to put $500 in just to make some extra spending money. 2 days later I’m down $40,000, 4 days from there I’m down almost my entire savings. 

I go through emotional comfort zones and emotional lows throughout each day. Keep telling myself it could be worse it could be worse. How blessed I am for all that is around me. Trying to normalize what I just done for the sake of my mental health. But then I randomly think of how absurd what I’ve done is and this giant dark secret I’m planning on keeping from the people who love me and ask me how I’m doing every single day with no idea of what has happened. 

I feel embarrassed, weak, idiotic, foolish, a waste, how if anyone knows what I did they will never be able to understand and look down on me. I don’t even understand it myself. I have zero traumatic life experience to link this too. I just simply am an idiot. 

I needed to vent somewhere. Gamblers anonymous aren’t doing meetings in person and I don’t want to get on a conference call with a bunch of people at once. I can’t find a way to contact someone to help me one on one, in person or over the phone.

I don’t know what to do.",70

I was so drugged I thought it would disappear so continued using, only when the drugs wore of after 5 days did I get the most intense pain, I just did not notice earlier.

I went to my local needle exchange to get reassurance and instead they were saying ""You may need to get amputated if this goes septic"". All they did was draw a line around it, if it got bigger I was to go to A + E.

It did not get bigger and a week later it had been absorbed by my body.

I’ve been dabbling with coke for a few years now. Started innocently enough at parties, and if I had any leftovers I’d take them home and keep them. I had a great stash at all times and was so proud of it because everyone else seemed to always just finish theirs. God I was proud of this self control.

Anyway, a couple of years ago I got bored and started taking it at random times. Now, I can’t have it in the house or I’ll just take it. But it’s super rare and maybe a topic for another time.

What I’ve come to realise is that even with the other drugs I take super sporadically (aside from weed and alcohol where it’s impossible), like md or shrooms, I’ve started to snort it too, even though I know the effects just will NOT be as good. Even with coke, I’ll make small lines and just keep taking them, not even giving myself time to feel anything. When I’ve taken it “at the wrong time”, i.e. alone, I’ve even blown my nose when I feared it was too much just to keep snorting.

If I don’t have coke in the house I won’t think about it, unless I’m drunk, but if it’s not the right setting I’ll quickly forget. I think it’s really psychological, I love the ritual of preparing it and the buzz of snorting something.

It’s even crossed my mind to placebo myself and snort something like sugar, but as weird as it sounds, because I know sniffing is terrible for you, I just don’t like the idea. 

Anyway, have you ever felt this? What do you think?

Edited to add a tl;dr: I think I’m addicted to snorting, rather than to any specific substance. Give me md, shrooms, Xanax, anything and now I just wanna snort it rather than take it in the smarter way. Have you ever felt this?",3

I used to smoke cigarettes at a peak of about a pack every 2.5 days. I switched to vaping when I was 18 which just enables the nicotine addiction to grow stronger since its much more passive than smoking. Not to mention more nicotine consumption overall. I've switched from 5 percent down to 2.4 percent down to 1.8 percent in the last month. I have quit cold turkey before but it is pretty unbearable for the first few days. I tried again last month from 5 percent to nothing and that shit turned made me so miserable on the first day that I decided it wasn't the best way to go about it. 

Anyway, does anyone have any tips on making the final cut of nicotine completely? How should I handle the oral fixation or the sinking feeling of reaching into your pocket for your vape only to find it empty? I originally used to smoke cigarettes just to amplify my weed high, but now I've quit weed completely seeing how destructive it was for me. Also its not worth another criminal charge.

I used to slug half full water bottles of vodka within a few minutes when young, and then turned into probably an average of 8+beers most nights when I could drink openly. The amount varied a bit but an average of 5-6 days a week I would drink, only stopping if my hangover was bad enough. When I tried to cut down and only buy a  couple tall boys I felt my addiction as soon as I sipped even a light beer, I couldnt stop from drinking all of what I had and would even drive somewhat drunk to get more. I've had some minor health problems and relationship problems that caused me to take quitting more seriously. I stopped cold turkey, started working out again, and eating healthy. I feel great. I haven't had a single craving since I stopped, even had my GF casually drinking and offer me a sip of a new beer and I didn't want it. It has been around a week and a half, and nothing. Is this somewhat normal? Did I even have an addiction in the first place?

P.S. I apologize if this is somewhat disrespectful to people that are really struggling. I'm just not sure what to think, and if I would be okay to drink a little since there's no issue with me stopping",2

My hands go numb, my breathing is uncontrollable, and I literally forget where I am. Feels like I’m on another planet. 
So my doctor prescribed me kolonopin for it. Addiction runs in my family so being aware of that, I only took it when I really needed it. Fast forward 2 months and I’m taking it every night. I’m drinking with it too. Last night I drank vodka and orange juice (but mainly vodka according to my roommate) and took one. This morning I woke up and took one. Yeah so I feel like I’m on a slippery slope and I don’t want to become addicted but it’s such a nice feeling.

Or am I still addicted.","Ok so, long story short, I realized I was addicted to alcohol a few months ago. After that, I stopped drinking. 

But I never really stopped. At the same time, I never really started again. Every week or two weeks, I would drink once (around 4-5 drinks). And then I would hate it, and dump out half the bottle. Then over the next week or two, I'd get the urge to drink again. I go out and buy my drink of choice, then drink a bit, hate it, hate myself, dump the whole bottle, repeat.

After a couple rounds of this I started to think ""maybe I just can enjoy my 1 time per week and then stop dumping out the alcohol."" But I can't stop doing that either. I ""built"" the habit into my system, once I feel drunk for the first time I will always throw out my entire collection of alcohol now. It's happened every time and I don't intend to stop it honestly. 

So at this point, I am buying alcohol, after a week of not drinking. I think to myself ""just enjoy the drunk feeling for today and quit for the next week or so. But don't throw out your drink so you're not wasting money."" But then I buy it, I drink it, I *still hate myself*, and I throw out the drink anyways. Ad repeat.

So what the fuck is going on? At this point, my alcohol consumption has decreased to ""acceptable"" levels. I built in habits that literally throw out alcohol whenever I feel drunk, and I like that habit and I'm keeping it alive. Yet I also am confused about this entire routine because it still feels like I am tied to the alcohol.

Am I losing control? Or am I gaining it, and being more responsible with it, and recognizing my limitations? Or am I lying to myself? Or am I being to harsh? I don't know what to think here. I don't know whether to be happy or upset at my actions.",1

- Addiction is a treatable, chronic medical disease involving complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an individual's life experiences
- We don’t have power over our addiction? Well this is a tricky question, however I think we must give that power up, to be released from the grip of addiction, yes we are powerless.  That overwhelming feeling is tough, its a nightmare, however, if you sit and observe those feelings instead act, you may, just may be okay. No you will be okay.  Educating yourself and setting yourself up for success is what will really set you free, this all starts with being okay, with not being okay.  You cant feel great or even good all the time, you must feel sad, mad, tired, anxious, etc.  Its okay, just feel it, you will get used to it.  That voice telling you to drink, smoke, eat, or whatever will become almost non existent.  Do a healthy coping behavior to deal with the negative feelings, moods, emotions you get.  Accept yourself and your thoughts emotions, It becomes second nature.  Meditation is very powerful, it helps you learn to see those thoughts, emotions, etc for what they are, just that.  You will find a balance where you feel overwhelming peace.  Every single religion has some form of meditation and fasting instilled in it, there is a reason for this.  Its one of the most powerful tools we have, it empowers us to live in the moment and realize we don’t have control over anything except our reaction. It gives you a sense of calming and lets you see the calm in the storm. Hope this helps open your eyes a bit, this could truly be the answer if you take anything out of this, know

Since  neither of us seemed attached, 2 weeks later we decided to be FWB and  were both cool with it. It worked out great for 6 weeks until he said he  was still completely in love with me and proposed that we become a  couple again and work toward a life partnership, a marriage eventually.  He even suggested we take a vacation overseas together. I told him I  didn't trust him and he'd have to build back trust with me by cutting  ties with the other women he'd been romantic with. He verbally agreed to  it but wouldn't actually do it. He still could never admit to the  cheating. So after a week, I told him we weren't a good fit for each  other, didn't want to keep sleeping together so that I wasn't stringing  his feelings along, but was cool with being friendly. His response, over  text:

""You're a cunt. You're poor  trash. Your family is a disfunctional buttfuck. You actually aren't  very attractive, at least to me. When the light hits you a certain way,  your age shows. You look just like your mom. You have friends who tell  you otherwise, but you're a total psycho. You have serious problems  perceiving reality. You're OFF. You're different. You're incorrect.  Other people know basic things which you don't. You're ungrateful,  stubborn and impervious to logic. Your last guy was in the right for  cheating on you. You might be funny and charming and fun in bed, but  that doesn't mean you're not evil. You don't love me bc you don't even  know me, you fat bitch.""

So....do  you guys think he actually loved me???? I'm joking, but also super  curious. Not that it matters because he's clearly not safe to be with,  but in HIS head, WTF is that? I had one other FWB in the past and when I  cut it off, that guy was totally chill about it, which was great but  also told me that he didn't have feelings. So that's what prompts me to  ask, did this upheaval of verbally abusive vomit mean that this guy  actually was head over heels for me??? Or was this a sex junkie who was  lashing out bc I flushed my cocaine brick of a vagina down the toilet  right in front of him? I discovered later that he also has an adderall addiction.

Here’s my story for context: 
I was addicted to opiates at 15 years old after having multiple surgeries & was smoking weed daily. My parents caught me, freaked out so I got sober and didn’t touch opiates for years but continued to smoke weed daily. At 17, I started finding opiates in medicine cabinets & stealing them. (very ashamed of that behavior.) & I began abusing my adhd medication. Soon after I started using again, I tried cocaine, Xanax, tramadol, anything I could get my hands on. I picked up a nicotine addiction in high school. began abusing adhd meds daily, buying pills, trying everything. Barely escaped getting expelled from school after drug dogs sniffed out my backpack in the classroom. I graduated HS & things got better for a few months until freshman year of college, my lowest point. 

Coke/adderall in the morning & Xanax at night was my routine freshman year of college. All this time I was still taking any opiate I could get my hands on. The end of freshman year I was a mess emotionally & physically so I stopped using coke, adderall, x, opiates & nicotine bc it was really messing with my health & appearance. At this point, I was using up to 180mg of adderall a day so the wds were bad. 

Surprisingly, I have kept this a secret from my family. They do not know that I relapsed. 

I never stopped smoking weed. But was successfully clean for 7 months from all other substances. 

Then I relapsed during finals week 2019 with adderall. it’s been a year & a half since this relapse & I am still using. 

I am currently using 90-120mg of adderall a day, drinking 3 - 5 beers a night, and smoking weed 2 to 3 times a day. Oh & nicotine. 

I am scheduled to graduate fall semester 2021 but honestly my GPA has taken a huge hit this semester because I have been drinking & smoking excessively. In one class I have to make an A on the final to pass, if I don’t pass I won’t graduate in the fall. 

I need advice. Idk what to do anymore. Addiction has been a part of my life since I was 15 & I can’t seem to beat it. I want to be clean but at the same time I am SO tired of fighting this battle. 

Any suggestions on what to do next ?

Talking to my family is the last thing I want to do bc I am embarrassed, they would be angry, it would become a fight.",1

What is it going to take to make him stop?

These are all the questions that go through my head on a daily basis. I am tired. I am hurting. It’s been 5 dreadfully long years of the same thing every single week, “I’m quitting today” “this is the last time” “I just need it to sleep” “I can’t do work withdrawing” “I’ll take off Monday and quit this weekend.” When..when is enough enough? When will he stop putting his body through this immense amount of pain every single week? I’ve helped him taper, I’ve held him hostage, I’ve contacted his family, I’ve left to make him see how serious I am, I’ve cried over and over and over again and have pleaded him to stop and I get nothing. I get the empty promise that tomorrow is the last day. The sneaking behind my back, the lying to my face, the hiding stuff under my nose, the not being able to talk to anyone about it because it’s a big secret and I don’t want people to tell me to leave him...when will I walk away on my own?

I’ve tried SO unbelievably hard to be strong for the both of us, but when will it eventually be enough? When will I finally find the courage to say, “I can’t do this anymore” and just leave? I have the fear that if I do leave then he will die or OD and it will be my fault, so I can’t. I love him more than anything..why doesn’t he want to get sober? What do I do?

I feel no difference at all. The usual jump off apathy has yet to appear, the anxiety and depression seem far off, and I'm insanely optimistic. 

As far as I know, blood serum levels do not show a significant drop until day 90, which means days 60-90 may end up being difficult and changing things. I have really high hopes, however, that this very mild withdrawal from the shot will remain the same and that will be the end of my story with opioids, both recreational and for maintenance. This alone may be all the discipline I need to push through. That's it. Done. 

I don't have any DD numbers, I haven't used recreationally in two years, and even then, it was 1,300 miles away. I can't hit them up, nor would I. I even told my boyfriend who is not a frequent user of drugs at all that if he was to seek out the vicodin he was craving, I would have to make the unfortunate decision to leave the relationship because my sobriety and my children benefitting from my sobriety are paramount. 

I hope if you're thinking about coming off using, you skip the strips that can be sold, over used, shot, and perpetuate the ""take something to feel better"" cycle and go right for the shot. You can't take it out. You break the reward cycle.

At first I wrote like a book but I realized no one would read the whole story and no one would even care, as usual in my lifetime.

I am now 24 and A couple of years a go I quit various drugs, included amphetamines and molly (maybe meth, not sure). Last year I quit smoking cannabis. This year I quit smoking cigarettes and also coffee and now I’m in mental hospital for my alcohol abuse - I quit that too yesterday. 

Found out the reason why I was addicted to all that - addiction to social media and smartphone. What causes social media to me? A lot of insecurities and anxiety. I lay all day long on my bed - being afraid of leaving the house because of social media advertisement, but instead of just leaving, I feed myself with that shit. Over and over again. It’s an circle.

Can any precious soul here relate somehow? Did anyone overcame social media addiction and/or anxiety without the need of using pills? If some experienced sobrists or anyone with a nice story could comment - It’d be very appreciated.

In love, suffering in bed.",14

I’m new to Reddit, so I hope this is the appropriate thread to post in about it. I’d love to hear what others think and would do in this situation. 

***TRIGGER WARNING: ABUSE, WEAPONS***

My boyfriend (27M) and I (22F) were together just short of 3 years. After our one year anniversary, he began experimenting with ice. I learned this was pretty common among the men he worked with at his union job. At that time, I would take an Adderall if I had a very busy day ahead of me (I worked 55 hours a week while in college full time). He already had a history of addiction with pain pills before we met, but I never used anything until we started dating. 

Eventually, we both got on ice and our relationship became very strained. After 6 months of us using, things became really bad. He quit his job and stopped helping me around the house. I’d constantly beg him to find work and do chores to help me. He became very abusive in multiple ways. I’ve had my ribs broken on three separate occasions. I’ve been to the ER for some injuries. He wouldn’t let me pay our bills, but he would take my card to ATMs and empty it to go buy drugs. He also put me in a lot of credit card debt. He said he recorded our arguments and played them to his psychiatrist, who then supposedly diagnosed me with a personality disorder w/ psychosis. He’s pointed a loaded gun at me during an argument to get me to shut up about asking him for help. I could go on and on, but this all continued for a little over a year. 

We finally agreed to get out of that lifestyle, so we moved back to our hometowns. He went to rehab in his while I stayed with my mother in mine. I began therapy immediately because I was experiencing pretty serious mental health issues. I was professionally diagnosed with PTSD, MDD, and anxiety. After 6 months of being clean and me going to therapy, we moved back into our own place again. It was very hard for me to get over what happened during active addiction. I heavily resented him, but I tried to work through that by telling myself it was the drugs making him be that way. I reminded myself that I wasn’t the same person while high, either. The drugs made me feel very anxious and stressed. Our relationship while sober wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t good either. We argued a lot, but nothing physical. 

After 10 months of sobriety and 4 months of us living together again, he took my car while I was sleeping. He then went to someone’s house, relapsed, and totaled my car right after. When he returned to our house, he woke me up and told me what happened. I had an emotional breakdown from the stress and that made him furious. He then threw stuff at me and hit me repeatedly. I tried to get out of the situation so we could both calm down, but he wouldn’t let me leave. A neighbor heard the commotion and called the cops. They ended up arresting him and a no contact order and protection order were put in place. 

With all that being said, what would y’all do in this situation? Do you think it was the drugs making him do this? Do you think relationships between two addicts work out? I’m sure there’s something I could’ve done better about all of this, so if you have any opinions on that, I’d like to hear them.",3

I realize I’m on Reddit, so I doubt this will apply to a lot of you, BUT if you have somehow gotten this far without trying cocaine, seriously don’t bother. It’s not worth it. Here’s some sadly real shit to evidence why... 

I spent the first 28 years of my life under the illusion that addicts existed in the same way aliens do... Like, they don’t live in my world so they might as well be on another planet. I think that’s a major reason why it took me so long to admit I was in fact one of those aliens, an addict.  But I had a problem long before I, or anyone, actually verbalized it. I remember drunkenly voicing my concern about my “usage” (definitely wasn’t calling it that back then) at a pool party over two years ago. I was sucking up a G every 4-5 days, which was a lot for me considering just months prior I’d barely touched the stuff. Yet no one even batted an eye lash at my confession, and in chorus agreed that it wasn’t a problem. I’ve tried to remember where along the way it morphed from *occasional weekend, when someone ELSE had the drugs* to a road towards life implosion. That’s the funny thing about addiction... it doesn’t happen over night, but instead sneaks up on you slowly when you aren’t looking. Anyway here I am, 31 years old, watching my dumpster fire of a life burn to the ground. “Rock bottom” happened last year, so wherever I’m headed now is definitely below ground... like the 6ft grave my friends and family will be standing around when this thing kills me. 

I don’t think anyone truly understands how bad it’s gotten. And why would they? Addicts are magicians at creating the illusion everything is “fine”. I talk about my usage before rehab last year (my first time, before this major relapse I’m currently in), I was blasting through an 🎱/day... that is child’s play compared to what I go through now. I don’t even want to admit how much, not even on Reddit. I lost my friends, I lost my job... so much of what makes up my identity. I’m disintegrating to dust, rail thin and gaunt - my health is failing while drugs fuel my eating disorder and self-hate. But as any addict or person close to an addict knows, when you’re deep in the grips of addiction literally nothing else matters but the drug.

Ok I’m done, feel free to comment if you’re out of control too, or even if you’re just bored.

Turning into a waste of space with ruined relationships.

It's gotten worse lately. 

I'm  a good person but with so many character flaws.

And I feel guilty that anyone has to even deal with me.

And the mistakes haunt me.

Those are the kinds of mistakes that you made. Which is why you're on this subreddit.

I know what to do. I'll try to recover. But honestly it feels like such a lost cause right now. 

I'm not suicidal at all but I do want to not be my current self in this situation. I want to hide and run away.. I want this horrible sick part of me to be gone. And if it ever does, I'm scared if there is anything worthwhile underneath left anymore.",3

Questions and concerns,"I got married 2 years ago and discovered very recently that he had been hiding a heroin addiction. When he came clean to me he said he had started using after we got married and was coming to me and his friends and family for help because he wanted to get clean.

After checking him into rehab, I later discovered that he had been on it for 5 years. He's been smoking it and doesn't inject it. Now ignoring for a bit the lies and deception, if we do decide to stay together I have some questions and concerns as this is taboo in the country I live and I can't find anything on Google.

Can you kick the habit after one stay at rehab for 3 months? Everyone around me says he'll definitely relapse once he's out. And that scares me because he asked for one chance and I'm willing to give that provided we work through this issue and others. Are there are stories of people who kicked the habit after one stint at rehab and never relapsed?

I guess I'm looking for stories that are positive so that I can decide whether it makes sense to have hope and attempt to save our relationship",2

I've had lot of loss in that time and I'm bipolar as well. I've been hospitalized twice with pancreatitis and both times I was forced to quit bc I was in hospital for 5 days. But within 2 weeks I would start again and be back to my full fifth a day in no time at all. A few weeks ago I started getting frustrated with the weight gain and depression (that didn't improved despite bipolar meds) and I told my psychiatrist I wanted to get sober. 
She told me to remind myself that when I want a drink to say out loud "" this isn't going to help me, it'll make me feel worse, that my body deserves to be treated better and alcohol is killing me"".
14 days ago I quit. I haven't drank since. I used to shake all day long even when I drank a few shots in the morning before work. My memory was not working for me at all. Now I feel like a new person. Everyone says I look brighter and I see it too. I feel happy and clear and the shaking is gone. Plus I am saving 240$/week! I am saving some and using some to buy things I've needed but went without so I could drink. 
It's different this time. I don't want to drink. I do have flashes, like when I'm about to leave work and I think ""yeah I get to have a shot soon""! But then I remember that I don't drink anymore and I'm ok. 
Idk why I quit this time and why it's different but it is and I am too. I hope this will help others who want to be free too. I never thought I could beat this. I was most afraid of the withdrawal because the recovery sites make it out to be so awful but they just want your business and money. I tried decreasing a few times to avoid it but I always started back up within a few days. This was the only way for me. It had to be all or nothing..

Addiction runs in my family but this in no way excuses my self destructive habits. I'm a 26 y/o female, and I haven't had a steady job in like 5 years. How long can this shut go on for? I got no long term plans. Let me say that my demon of choice is DXM. I know people say it's a middle school drug but to me, it was a good time. I have been messing with this crap for 3 years because it hide the bad thoughts. I struggle with depression and anxiety,  and at the right dose this stuff makes me upbeat and friendly. In reality, it's wrecking my self worth and relationships with the people in love especially my boyfriend. He's a great hardworking guy who doesn't partake in such things,  and I often find myself thinking he deserves better. Maybe I'm right. 
I'm just tired of being a bum. I watched my mom battle a similar demon, and it's just not where it's at. I woke up this morning with the intention of getting high. I shoveled 16 R30s down my throat and immediately regretted it. Now I'm sitting here looking stupid after puking my guts out. I can't take this shit anymore. I just want to be okay. A part of me wants to die because  I don't see things getting better. I have become indifferent to pretty much everything.  My chest hurts, my throat is dry even after drinking 3 bottles of water.
My dog is giving me a concerned look, and I feel like I'm letting her down. I'm tired of using the Pandemic as an excuse to continue fucking up. Pardon my language. 
Sorry for the long post. Thank you

During these times I would be lightly high, all the time. Usually for about 2 weeks. I seem to be very sensitive to it, and oral use maximizes the time you’re high.

Importantly, I would miss several nights of sleep each time (only 1 night, but frequent) and skip eating happily. Water and hygiene were good. 

Now, addiction wise I’m actually not super worried. I only knew 1 plug and I told him not to get it for me again. He’s agreed not to and he middle mans it so he has no incentive to push it. I’m internationally not too worried, and I have absolutely no way to get it now.

Moving to my subject:

My teeth are fine, maybe whiter than before, but I gain horrible weight between periods of use. My skin seems worn. I feel lazy and tired without it. I do though miss my personality that shines through when I’m sober still.

2021-04-26 02:48:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/myrjql/it_works/,It works.,"My name is Robert, and I am an alcoholic. Furthermore, I am a person who is recovered from countless addictions and behavioral challenges. I was like so many individuals who were lost and afraid that nothing would ever change. I remember feeling so isolated and alone as a child. I was so confused and scared that I would get lost in my tears. I remember lying in bed at night when I was five and six years old and wondering why it hurts so much being me.

As I grew older, the pain deepened. When your pain goes to the degree that my pain did, it sets up an interesting dynamic. We learn at an early age that we are just not comfortable in our skin. From the earliest of memories, I remember I wanted to be somebody else, doing something else, be somewhere else. I did not feel comfortable in my skin. I was never satisfied. 

My family dynamic was that of an alcoholic father, a codependent mom, and I was the middle child of seven children. We grew up in a home that was always upside down, and trying to find my balance was impossible. I became the chameleon. I never knew what someone else wanted or how I could become what I had to become for others to accept me. 

Maybe you can relate to these feelings that I had. By the time I was a teenager things became much worse. As a child, little is expected of you. As we grow, so do the expectations that others have for us. This was not only true in my family, my social circles, and even academically. Because I did not feel that I had value I did not believe I could produce anything of value. The hole gets deeper and deeper and deeper. 

We end up in what I have heard termed “the hole of no hope.” When I was 14 years old, I took my first drink because I could get away with it. I remember how it made me feel once the alcohol hit my system. I went from being nothing to almost. When you come from nothing, are convinced you are always going to be nothing, being an almost is the top of the world. Every subsequent drink I took was an attempt to recapture that feeling of being an almost. 

When one is convinced they will never amount to anything, being an almost is everything. In the beginning, it seems harmless enough and the frequency was based on the amount of emotional pain that I was feeling. I found as I got older, and my social circle grew, and my family and educational expectations grew, my anxiety of not measuring up grew as well. As I was constantly being reminded, the feeling that I was nothing grew, and so my need to be an almost grew proportionately. 

Since I was not capable of becoming almost on my own, I had to find the opportunity and the alcohol to be fulfilled. This is where the cycle became dangerous. My reliance was not on me feeling good about who I was. It was based on a substance that I found myself increasingly needing in frequency and amount. 

When I turned 16 years old, I realized my drinking was getting out of control and had become obvious to others. It became necessary for me to experiment with other substances that would enhance my sensation that alcohol alone could no longer produce. In the beginning, a joint here and a joint there was sufficient, but that would make me tired and lethargic, and I was not left with a very adequate means to concentrate in school. 

Someone introduced me to methamphetamines, and this helped keep me up and active during the day. Now instead of just drinking, I was smoking marijuana and eating amphetamines. The challenge with that was not eating, and I found it increasingly more difficult to sleep. That is when I began to introduce barbiturates into the rotation. Barbiturates were a very curious drug; that they did what alcohol was doing, but did it without the hangover. This went on and on until I got to my senior year in high school and on my 18th birthday, I decided to drop out of school. 

It was January 3rd, and I would graduate that May. Nevertheless, my drinking and using career was needing my attention. I found it more important and more necessary to drink and use than what I thought a high school education could bring me. As the years passed and my struggles became greater, there was not a relationship or an opportunity that I was not willing to set aside to drink and use. 

By the time I was 27 years old, I had become chronic in my addiction. I had added compulsive gambling, overeating, pornography, and I started throwing up three to five times per day. I was at the end of my rope and I knew that if something did not change, I was going to die. I knew there were no more chances for me. 

On February 9th of 1986, I entered treatment and admitted I was an alcoholic. I was introduced to Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and other 12 step groups. I began my pursuit of recovery. I began going to meetings and meeting new people. I was enjoying what I was finding in the rooms of recovery. Nevertheless, I found it so difficult in being honest with others. 

I was sincerely afraid that you would find out that I was nothing. I knew that if I spoke too much or became too honest, you would figure that out and I would be the first person in the history of a 12-step program that you would ask not to come back. I know that sounds laughable to some, but it was a real fear for me. 

Once again, I knew that something had to change, or I was going to die. I knew honesty was the best path for me, yet being honest was almost as fearful as the death that was waiting for me. Sadly, that led to my relapse after 71 days of being sober. 

Fortunately for me, I only found it necessary to drink for five days. I was trying to recapture that feeling of being an almost. At the end of those five days, I realized that the only place for me was back in the rooms of recovery. On April 25th of 1986, I walked back into the rooms of Alcoholics Anonymous and I have never left. 

That means that as of April 25th of 2021, I am celebrating 35 years of personal recovery. Even more astounding than 35 years is that it translates into 12,784 consecutive days of saying yes to life and no to my addiction. The journey has been remarkable. 

There have been some challenges along the way, but then again, life is filled with challenges. I will never forget what it was like being a newcomer. It was the most frightening thing that I had ever experienced and yet I could not leave because I knew that I would die. 

I realized that the only way for me to stay clean and sober and to become happy, joyous, and free was to apply the plan of recovery to the best of my ability. I made it my passion to go to meetings, get and work with my sponsor and become acclimated to a power greater than myself. As I did those things and began incorporating the 12 steps into my personal life things began to change in ways that I could have only dreamed of. 

I went from being a nothing and an occasional almost to somebody who had more hope than anyone I had ever met. I began to resemble the people that I had met in the rooms of recovery. I began living and sharing some of the stories that I had heard them share with me. 

When I would hear them share those stories my heart began to dance and sing, and I wished that those things would happen to me. They have happened to me and so many more. I cannot imagine a life that does not include one day at a time (ODAAT) and living a plan of recovery. I can honestly tell you for nearly all my 35 years of personal recovery, I wake up every day with a sense of gratitude and peace in anticipation because of what I have been so freely given. 

I meet many people who are struggling the way I had struggled. I speak with many individuals who are trying to find the magic that would take them from dying a lonely death to a life of personal fulfillment and that surpasses all understanding. This is what I have found in my recovery journey. I was so fortunate that I met so many amazing people along the way. 

Every person of significance to me, (outside of one who died during a relapse) are either clean and sober today or have passed away in sobriety. When I mentioned these individuals, I am talking about people who are sober 37, 39, 41, and 44 years. My sponsor Jack passed away two years ago with 44 years of personal recovery. Individuals like Texas Mike, Pete the Greek, Russian Ted, and Doc Irv all passed away as recovered members of the 12 Step Program. 

One of the most exciting things about the plan of recovery that I followed is that it is a complete blueprint. When followed, the likelihood of having all the things it promises is all but guaranteed. I don't mean to say that everyone who starts the program of Alcoholics Anonymous finishes or lives a sober life. 

What I am saying is I have never known anyone to relapse when they followed the path. After my relapse back in 1986, I was face to face with how dangerous I was to myself. The prospect of another relapse scared me more than I had ever been scared. I asked my sponsor what I needed to do to never relapse again. The answer was simple. The answer is service. 

When I decided to incorporate the plan of recovery into my life for the express purpose of becoming more equipped to help others it completely revolutionized my thinking. I was no longer about me. It was about “we.” Developing this way of thinking was transformational for me. 

There is a quote in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous that talks about selfishness and self-centeredness being foundational to every problem I had ever had. Setting aside my ego is the best thing I could ever do. 

Growing in sobriety has been the greatest journey one will ever take. That is exactly what recovery is. Recovery is a journey; it is not a destination. I am so glad that there is a finish line other than death. 

My goal is to accomplish what my sponsor Jack Fisher accomplished. Jack sadly succumbed to cancer a little more than two years ago. At the time of his death, Jack had 44 years of continuous sobriety. As I chatted with him in his hospital room and knowing it would be the last time I was to see him alive, I asked him “Jack, what do I tell them? What is your message you want me to share with others?” Jack looked at me with his cancer sunken eyes and said “Bob, tell them it works.” 

That simple phrase has resonated with me in different ways. The most important way it resonated with me is that it underscored the simplicity of what we're doing. There is no magic. There is no wondering if or how or when. The program of recovery works when you work it. 

My message to you - and I want you to hear this loud and clear - is it works. I see so often people in social media bashing one recovery program or another. 

Here's the deal, they all work. When you look at some of the programs within the monotheistic religions of the world and other secular programs, they work. There are far too many people who have been successful to suggest that they don't work. The common denominator of anything less than success is not the program, it is the person applying the program. 

The opening paragraph in Chapter 5 of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous reads “rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path. Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program.” End of the story. I am fully convinced that when we apply the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and the plan as laid out in the first 164 pages of recovery, our result will be permanent sobriety. 

I also believe this to be true with the Muslim Faith, Judaism, LDS Recovery, Celebrate Recovery, the Buddhist Network, and the list goes on and on. If you are involved in any of these programs or find a program where it has been demonstrated that it has worked for countless others, then guess what, if it doesn't work it is you. Why not humble ourselves? 

Why not be as honest as only a dying person can be honest? I love the simplicity of the program as it states all we need to be is honest, open-minded, and willing. If we are these three things daily, there is never any reason for us to go back out again. So many people go out and never come back. 

I count myself so fortunate to be a person who relapsed, found the doors of recovery still open, and gave it another go. As I wrap up this message to you today, I want you to know how grateful I am to have been given the gift of recovery. When I consider myself to have been clean and sober 3 1/2 decades I am beyond grateful. What is even more astounding is that today is day 12,784 consecutive days of saying yes to life and no to death. 

The areas in my life that I have been given are beyond, but I believe I deserve. I have a marriage of 32 years. My children that I abandoned at the height of my addiction have forgiven me and we have a loving and working relationship that is in a continual process of heightened healing. 

I don't regret who I am. Matter of fact, I celebrate who I am. I am no longer a person who came from nothing and would remain a nothing. My goal is no longer to be almost. Today I am somebody filled with hope, potential, and a satisfying heart of helping others achieve what I have been able to achieve. 

I hope you are one that I can pass this mantle onto as you are beginning or continuing your journey of recovery. I have been blessed, fortunate, and honored to go from broken to whole. I desire to teach and guide others to find their way. 

There will come a time that I am as Jack was. I will be laying in a hospital bed getting close to my last breath and someone that I love and who loves me will ask me what my message is that they can pass on. My message to them will simply be “it works.” 

My name is Robert, and I am an alcoholic.",46

I wasn't doing recovery though. It all came tumbling down in March. My panic disorder came back with worse symptoms and I caved into the fear. 

My addictions are porn/masturbation as well as tech use to escape my feelings. 

I was in a men's group that helped keep my accountable. I quit that last year when the pandemic was in it's first few months. I'm TIRED of quitting everything good for me BUT this addiction. It's annoying and I want to be done with it. I feel miserable and so out of energy to fight anymore. 

I've tried getting back with my sponsor but I am feeling so unworthy and in my head so much that I get to a thought of ""why surrender and let go of control?"" I need my former self to die and it scares me to my very core because I can't see the future. Then I realize that none of us can and we take each day as it comes... But for me I'm so self absorbed I think I'm the only one that is in this situation.  

Addiction is so deep and so complex that even when you have the knowledge of what to do, getting the help to do those things is still so difficult because of the effort it takes to get through withdrawal. I need help. A lot of it. I just wish I would stay humble and say this to people before I get to this miserable state of brain fog and desensitization. It really is a nightmare.",2
2021-04-26 00:18:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mypdt0/does_anyone_have_experience_from_multiple/,Does anyone have experience from multiple addiction?,"I don’t know if anyone will read this or understand, but I want to get out my story. This is a throwaway, because what I’m about to write is super personal & I haven’t really shared it all in one place. My partner knows my story, and I am so grateful for his love & support. He hasn’t really had the same struggles, though, so I guess I’m writing to see if someone, anyone out there can relate—and to just collect my own thoughts & say them in a public place with a degree of anonymity. I’m on mobile, so please forgive any typos. 

I (31f) have always been a very open person—I enjoy meeting new people & having new experiences. I started drinking & smoking weed around 18 yo, and experienced a variety of substances in my 20s...lots of alcohol, lots of marijuana, but also the occasional use of other random drugs—mostly psychadelic substances. Lots of acid, some mushrooms, MDMA & ecstasy, cocaine, dextromethophan, adderall, maybe hydrocodone & xanax a couple times (never actually been one for pills), salvia, opium...I’m probably forgetting some. The past couple years I’ve added cigarettes and kratom to the list. 

Around 2017, I started drinking a lot more and over a couple years it spiraled out of control. After some therapy, the ending of a relationship, and leaving a toxic work environment I quit drinking regularly. I didn’t tee-total, but drastically reduced my use—I drank on 22 days in 2020, and so far only twice this year. The idea of “never again” freaks me out, but I am proud of the radical progress I have made on that front. 

At the beginning of 2020, I resigned from a very emotionally-taxing, toxic job. It was in healthcare, and I had picked up smoking (ignorantly) because everyone did it—I enjoyed the social aspect of it & the how it helped me escape from the incessant needs of the office. A couple years ago, I discovered kratom. My bf and I would take it recreationally & just hang out. 

Shortly after I resigned, covid hit and for months I didn’t have much luck finding another position. The world seemed on hold. Luckily I had built up some savings that carried me through, but during that time I struggled with a lot of depression. It’s not something unfamiliar to me, as I have had bouts of it most of my adult life. At this point, I had been prescribed 10mg of lexapro and it seemed to be helping—I didn’t fully realize how much until I had to stop taking it when I lost my insurance through my job.

I know it’s an irresponsible conceit, but I live in a beautiful area of the US and I have always loved to just drive around the countryside. During my time of unemployment, I took to driving around, shooting shots of kratom & water, and chain-smoking the whole time. I just couldn’t stand to sit at home. When I was home, I smoked as much weed as I possibly could. I didn’t really have the spare money for any of these indulgences, but the alternative of doing nothing & being alone with my thoughts seemed like hell. 

I was absolutely fortunate to find another job in September 2020 and have been there since. It has it’s own stresses and complications (the company is going under new management in May). I was able to get insurance and a new provider and re-started lexapro about a month ago. But despite my blessings, I still struggle with depression—my energy is so low & I feel like utter dogshit most days. I’ve been waking up with crippling anxiety in the mornings. Even though I’m no longer drinking regularly, it seems like I’ve ended up self-medicating in other ways. I’m now in this cycle where I take kratom upon waking (and periodically throughout the day at work), along with drinking about 2-3 energy drinks most days & smoking way too many cigarettes. When I’m not at work, I am trying to get blazingly stoned. 

I know this is not good for me; I know it’s not healthy. Has anyone gone through anything similar? How do you break multiple addictions at once? I don’t want to say “never again” to any of these substances, but I’m afraid that’s the only option. Is it? Can balance be found for addicts?",2
2021-04-26 00:11:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/myp9ld/how_my_severe_nicotine_vaping_addition_is_eating/,"How my severe nicotine vaping addition is eating away my life. Over 2 years ago, I never thought I'd be addicted - My personal story of how bad this really is... possible advice or help?","\*As you read this, I ask you to please understand that I am learning what an addiction really is. It's different learning about it in college psychology class than actually experiencing it first hand. I am not fully aware of everything that happened until I had to look at myself from a 3rd person point of view to comprehend how bad it got. Any addiction no matter what the subject is can really take over someone's life.

Nicotine, caffeine, weed, \[insert whatever\] affects everyone differently. The affects of my addiction are so bad that I look in the mirror and I don't know who I am looking at. I feel like I have an alternate personality and I have not seen myself in a long time.

I smoke 50/50 (5%) nic salts through a vape, every morning, day, night. Literally every waking moment from waking up to falling asleep. But every morning, I cannot get out of bed. Would I love to quit? Absolutely.

&#x200B;

\- It makes me pee a lot. I have to use the bathroom frequently like every hour, ...and of course I smoke in there.

\- My breathing, it sucks. I feel like I haven't breathed in fresh air in 2 years.

\- This pandemic and the whole being alone part made my addiction really bad because I have less to look forward to.

\- I smoke at work, in the bathroom, or my car. It is taking away from my productivity due to the obvious time, but also my focus - I am always thinking of when I am going to take the next hit. I want to note that I have a relatively high stress job.

\- My laziness has reached an insane level. I rarely rarely cook anything now. Even preparing food feels like a bad chore. Any task that requires work I instead don't do it because I know I can get a rush of endorphins by getting my nicotine high. My bedroom is looking like a hoarder's house.

\- My short term memory is starting to fade at odd moments and it is scary. During my morning bathroom routine I caught myself trying to put on my contact lenses again after I already put them on 10 minutes ago. As I grabbed the toothbrush, my other hand was going towards grabbing soap instead of toothpaste.

\- I don't even go to the gym anymore because my energy level is so down, and it's also hard to breathe with masks. Motivation is out the window, and this is the opposite of who I was.

\- Instead of subconsciously doing things, I have to think to do them. For example, eating. There are days where I literally have to remember that I have to eat, like 3:30 pm would go by and I do. Arguably, we can say that a side effect of nicotine may be decreased appetite, which leads to a cycle of less energy to do things, increased laziness since you get a rush of endorphins from taking a hit off the vape. I may know my car needs a wash, but I cannot pair the need with the realization that I have to clean it.

\- It's like the nicotine endorphin rush replaces the need for me to do other things because my brain gets rewarded in a much more convenient, and quicker way.

\- Sometimes my heart randomly jumps to 220 BPM...while I am just chilling... never had this prior to vaping. After 90 second to 5 minutes it settles back down to normal. Anxiety attack? I don't have an anxiety disorder though.

\- Of course the fidgeting hands, shaking fingers, headaches, getting easily irritated etc....... but I literally pull my hair out now when I am stressed. I never did that before.

\- I am constantly irritated and it's scary because it is not me. Not as in I get angry ""I'm going to lose my shit"" or lose my temper, but rather a level of patience - let's call it that. I used to be a calm person and now I react to too many things internally. 

\- Things I want to mention aside from nicotine: I have high sensitivity to the psychological aspect of caffeine, so I avoid coffee. I have a kind of lightweight tolerance for alcohol, and no matter how little I drink, I still feel like shit the next day. I am not an alcoholic. I keep that relatively moderate.

\- I don't want to get out of bed. It sucks, I want to, but I can't. Even for hobbies that I loved doing.

\- I have no enjoyment of anything anymore. Well... let's call it rather greatly diminished enjoyment.

To sum it up, this movie quote from American Psycho really fully describes me right now, I don't mean this as a joke:

>*""There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman; some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there.""*

**I want to quit. I am fully dedicated to quitting. I want my life back.** I made this 2nd reddit account tonight so I can finally let it out anonymously. But I did not want to create a throwaway because I want to interact with people maybe in similar situations like mine. Honestly, writing this out put me on the final straw of ""I'm quitting now"". I never really had a motivating turning point until now when I realized how shitty my life is directly because of my nicotine problem.

I am going cold turkey. My friends told me to ladder down with the nicotine % but I already tried and I only rebounded. Knowing how much nicotine has been in my blood for 2 whole years this is going to be a potentially dangerous withdrawal... pre-covid I mistakenly left my vape at home one day and got the spins at work with a major headache... I had to leave early after only 4 hours to get home and take a hit. 

Tomorrow I am going at it: I am working from home.  Prepared with Advil, water, and going for a walk around my neighborhood in the morning before I start work. This is going to be brutal. Can anyone give me some advice if they have anything to add? Any supplements I can take that help with withdrawal?",2

For those who are resistant to mainstream and western addiction treatment.,"Hello everyone. It’s maksimos, I wrote an extensive post yesterday about my decision to begin recovery. I have attempted the widely available methods of recovery (rehab, NA, AA, Etc.) multiple times. After several discouraging failures, I was lucky to stumble upon an ancient and holistic addiction treatment. Some may already be familiar with it. Today, I did my first Kambo ceremony. Feeling better with this than any treatment (and it takes barely any time at all!)Tomorrow, if authorized by my caregivers, I complete another ceremony tomorrow. This ceremony I will record and post to YouTube, partially masked for my personal protection. After I complete the ceremony, I will write a description of how it felt internally, and you will get to see it externally. Trigger warning! though, Kambo ceremonies often times involve violent vomiting, as well as intense discomfort. I am looking forward to revealing an uncommon way to heal !",0

I knew that they had done coke before (against my advice not to), but I didn't realize how bad it had gotten. 
They would ghost me for days at a time and reappear when their binge had come to an end. I thought they would do it maybe once every 3-5 months or so (about how often they'd ghost me), but they told me recently that was only when they'd go on a binge. In reality, they had just been doing it in smaller increments of time, 12-hour binge instead of 4-day binge. 

They've been reaching out to me more and more recently and I prodded them to tell me what was going on. They said they had been overwhelmed and depressed and anxious lately (I assumed it was pandemic blues), but they recently told me they're full-blown addicted to cocaine. 

Like I said, we've only know each other for about a year. Their family isn't around and I don't know any of their friends. I want to help them, but I'm not sure what to do. 

I suggested rehab, but they're hesitant because they're concerned they may be fired from their job if anyone found out. I told them to lose their dealer's number and to call me instead. I've been making it a point to visit them or have them come over to my house whenever they feel like they want to use.  

They're planning a trip in the next few months to fly out to visit their family (and be away from the access to drugs) for a few weeks. I'm not sure if quitting cold turkey is good or bad. I don't have a lot of experience in this department. 

I just want to help my friend get better.",2

I’ll just copy and paste the description for those who are interested:

Helen Redmond went to six countries to create ""Liquid Handcuffs: A Documentary to Free Methadone"". She created this film to address the struggles many people face when trying to get the medication they need; Methadone. Methadone is, to put it simply, a medication used to treat patients battling addiction by reducing the pleasure experienced from taking opioids, heroin, or other addictive drugs. This severely reduces the urge to take whatever the addictive drug is. With less of an urge to take addictive drugs, it's no wonder why the number of people overdosing and addiction rates fall by nearly half in locations it's accessible. Yet, there are so many obstacles for patients to jump through in order to get their treatment. In this episode, we discussed everything related to Methadone, from what it is, to its impact, to how we can improve its accessibility.",2

Married with the most amazing person. But they don't understand addiction and depression. So I keep quitting while they carry on with normal life but then its there in my face and I cave!

I'm suffering with the whole pandemic and losing my job last year. We turned to using at home together as we had nothing else to do. But I have a history ...... partner does not. They do not understand. I'm in an everything or nothing mode. Which is not good. First warning sign. Because in everything mode its a few grams or more then a few grams a wk and copious amounts of alcohol. 

I opened up to partner last wk and spoke honestly. Also spoke and showed them posts that I have made on reddit so they could understand the place I'm in.... anyway the reaction was supportive but horrified I'd reached out on reddit....

Reddit is like a life line for me.... how do you describe that? To get out what you feeling and know ppl will feel the same and not judge you. Ppl who know the dark hole of depression and addiction.... how you feel like you've let everyone around you down because you're so hard on yourself but you can't stop being hard on yourself. I said today how I feel like just being on my own with no one around... to me that means... no noise ... no expectations I'm on my own I can't let anyone down.... to my parter they heard... you don't live me you want a divorce. Which is the last thing I want.

So we had this big fight and I landed up storming out the house for a drive. Now partner is in bed with kids and I'm using and drinking on my own. How sad. Then know I'm going to have to confess this in the morning. 

Anyway I have reached out for help... have appointment with psychiatrist this wk will probably go to a clinic for a bit.

I moved out of my parents’ at 18, she still lives with them. She’s been using weed for about 3-5 years and meth for about a year or so. We also live in different states. Neither of us live in our home town anymore, but our home town is where she frequently runs off to for drugs. It’s less than 2 hours from where I live, and a little over 2 hours from where she lives. 

She begged to stay with me bc she wants to be closer to me and have a relationship with me, so I agreed she could visit. Day 1, steals $20 from my purse (1st time stealing from me) and runs off around 2-3am to get Xanax and weed (according to her) and hang out with a friend in town (didn’t think she knew anyone where I live). Day 2, she expresses remorse, apologizes to me, and realizes what she did was inexcusable BUT reveals to me she’s trying to cope with the death of a friend. Didn’t ask for proof, but my mom sends me an article explaining the car accident her friend died in. I make it very clear that while it wasn’t ok to run off and steal from me, I recognize she really only knows how to cope with drugs. I tell her we can only have a relationship if she’s willing to get professional help and I would even help her get connected to resources. I also tell her she has to be honest and communicate with me. She agrees to everything. Later that day, she asks if she can hang out with a friend. I say yes bc finally she’s being honest! In my mind, I figured she was gonna hang out with this friend regardless, but at least she was telling me. I remind her to just keep me updated, check in, call me if she needs me, etc. 

She ghosts me for an entire day. Finally got a hold of her today and she admits to running off to our home town but she swears she’ll be home tonight. 

Am I doing anything wrong here? Did I inadvertently enable this behavior? I guess this is me venting and also seeking advice as she’s the only person I’m close to that has a drug addiction. I’m worried about being too controlling bc my parents do enough of that, but I’m also not here for her to just use me to get drugs. Not to be selfish, but I’ve tried so hard to keep a distance from my family bc they’re so dysfunctional and tend to worsen my depressive symptoms. I love and care about them, but I’ve been trying to keep my distance as a form of self-care bc they’re so stressful to deal with. I’m trying so hard to hide my true feelings from my sister bc at this point, I think I’m the only person in our family that can help her (i.e., by encouraging her, not forcing her, to get professional help). But it’s only been 4 days and her being here has already started taking a toll on my mental health.",1

I used to think at the peak of my addiction, just putting a bit to much fentanyl would allow me to go over peacefully. (Making my Mother and Sisters think it was a mistake, though loosing a dad and brother I just feel it is selfish. So I tried so so hard and now I stopped. The public behaviour caused by my seizures just got me ridicule and boys/men running over me to better their own testosterone/gains, sure there was plenty of good hearted folk but if I forgot a face/name after a seizure what does that mean to me now in recovery?

It is a evil and horrific world were people act evil on others for the sake of ""good"". Drugs made me so happy to participate yet a society forced me to stop them with shame and taking my child. I contemplate relapse frequently, the trouble of hospitals forcing me to get help from my mum has just made it such a daunting prospect to go injecting again.

Need a girlfriend if I cannot see my child, unfortunately people prefer I make bridges, leaving the true evil people to be beside and behind me.

I always thought that a mix of ketamine, benzos and then fentanyl would be peaceful. When I lived alone I would anesthetise with MXE and valium. It worked until local people took my excitement to mean free rain over me, leading to robbery and severe events which I can hardly (incorrectly) recall.

Was about 2016-2017 when my life changed from drug use to severe trauma and a public that would only view and judge the drug use. I am now 200+ days sober from anything hard, I am happy but I will always be aware of what made me completely empty inside, it appears that is the standard human condition (considering how much people get ""deppressed"" nowadays. A caring girl friend is what I need but not what I can bridge.

I had no idea the reason I felt so depressed for years was because my body craved opiates, I was only a child. Now here I am in my early 20s still craving anything that can make me feel happier.",55

i've got my exams (gcses) starting tomorrow. for a lot of the subjects i've hardly learnt any of the content because i stopped caring about education a couple years ago due to my mental health. i usually never get exam stress but this defines my future and i've got no idea what i'm doing, also i'm worried about whether or not i'm gonna get an offer from the college i want to go to.

the way i usually deal with things is with ket. i've got £5 at the moment i was supposed to be saving to buy ritalin for my exams but my friend wasn't able to get me his. i don't know how else to cope with this stress, it's not even that bad but i'm not used to it and it's making me really irritable and frustrated with anything. i don't think there's any way i can get hold of any right now so that's probably for the best idk",1

Sacrificing past habits and memories in order to develop a vision of a new life.,"The worst is over, the tsunami of struggle in my life caused by my own selfish desires has finally allowed me to wade above the water long enough to see where the sky meets the sea. If I can create this overwhelming tsunami of negativity in my life, before I could even swim, I can build the tallest tower, so that i may never have to experience the overtaking coldness of the water again in my life. The only reason to go back is to rescue those drowning the way I was before they perish. I love you all. I wish y’all the best in your endeavors. I hope that each and every individual reading this, even if I do not have a personal relationship with you, finds the strength within yourselves to fight your strongest demon and it’s underlings. My Crucifixion will soon end. The weight of my world has finally crushed me. While I lay underneath the weight of the burdens I have caused myself, the realization I can one day feel alive again motivates me to discontinue the manipulation of my end. The evil nature my soul has adopted, can be cleansed, and will be cleansed. Now, in this present moment, as well as in the near future, I must Sacrifice my past habits and memories for the vision of a new life. The bottom has greeted me on multiple occasions, but instead of learning what it’s like, and staying there, I must build a ladder to climb out, no matter The height of my climb. My only focus is to change. My only focus is to save my own life from the evil I caused myself to experience. From the bottom, I will build. Hopefully one day, people who chose the same path of thorns and discomfort, the path of an energy vacuum that will keep you trapped as long as you let it, I can encourage and reveal the sight of something better. Addiction is trading one thing for everything. Recovery is giving up on one thing, for life, for everything. No longer can I allow myself to be hypnotized by the evil entity contained within certain psychoactive substances. No longer can I destroy myself further than I already have. If I continue, I will truly lose everything, including my life. I must change the script and the blocking, in order to truly illustrate a story of hope and fulfill my purpose, instead of neglecting my spiritual and vibrational callings, and pursuing self destruction so I can experience short term pleasure. I will take only a few hygiene materials, identification documents, the clothes on my back, essentially only my necessities, and leave everything I know behind. After many failed attempts at recovery, I finally want better for myself and those that surround me. It is not too late. I am still breathing. I can still accomplish overcoming my grievances and accepting the fact that at one point in my life, I was comfortably living as the person I spent my whole childhood practicing avoiding. This was not me, trauma does not carry identity. I may be living as a hollow man now, but today is the day I begin the solidification of my existence. Today is the day I begin the healing process.[the pitchfork](https://imgur.com/gallery/eFCB8ip) ([track marks left behind ](https://imgur.com/gallery/yg5hIl7)",52

For a little history about my friend- He was born blind and they've always felt like no one will want to be with them long term because of this. A few days ago, a person they wanted to be with rejected them, saying ""youre blind thats why I cant be with you. Im also blind, i need someone who can drive me places because i have 4 kids"" 
This devastated my friend. He wants to be able to care for someone and their children, whether its his kids or not. He's the sweetest person. When my dad passed away, he welcomed me to his home and took care of me. I felt like I was with family tbh. I dont think he knows how much I care, because Its just something i cant express in words, I wish i could but I suck at expressing myself that way. He goes to NA meetings twice a day. Hes been clean for a year. I'm so proud of him. He said he wanted to smoke meth or do coke. Its the initial feeling he gets, but down the road he gets suicidal when on drugs. Hes also taking antidepressants.

I lost my dad to alcoholism last year in June, and the idea of my friend doing this scares me. If he started doing drugs again, I'd lose sleep and cry too much. I live very far away from him, so i wouldnt be able to see him. All I have are my words. 

I've told him please wait this out. Its a horrible feeling but it passes like it has for you before. Just be patient. I feel this desperation like I did with my dad. I feel like I cant do anything.

The one tricky thing is my friend has feelings for me. But I have a boyfriend ive been with for almost 7 years. I knew my friend since middle school. He seems to really want love, and doesnt seem to matter much with who, but he only has feelings for me. I feel like maybe it would be bad for me to help, because id maybe trigger him??? Can you all please help me with what I can do? I know not to control which I wouldnt ever. I would never insult, etc.

How would you help my friend?",2

After a difficult few months I started smoking daily around December 2019 when I was 17. This continued all throughout the pandemic. I tried to quit in September 2020 when I moved to university, but my mental health problems got very bad, I made no friends, did no work and I started drinking every night alone instead. I returned home in December 2020 and started smoking every day again. Now that I think about it, I don't think I wanted to start smoking again, I just wanted to distract myself from my pain. I didn't enjoy it at all and every time I smoked I got paranoid and decided I wanted to quit but when I got sober I realised I couldn't live with myself and didn't know how to heal and like myself so I smoked again. I desperately wanted to quit but I felt unable to. After smoking CBD instead for a few weeks and only smoking THC weed around twice a week I felt like soon I could quit altogether. I ran out of CBD on Thursday and gave the last of my regularly weed away yesterday to a friend. who bought me a book in return. As of today, I have no plans to buy weed or CBD and I hope it stays that way.

I think I've always had addictive tendencies. I used to drink 3-4 energy drinks a day when I was 11 to when I was 17 and then I starting smoking weed instead. I've been really struggling with my mental health since I was 10 or 11 and struggled to forgive myself for falling into an addiction. Weed made me forgetful, unintelligent and very difficult to have a conversation with. I still feel like I don't really know who I am and feel very worthless. I really want to improve myself but I don't know where to start. I've been eating very poorly my whole life and I really want to change that, exercise, and read more but I'm so impatient with myself and I hate that I wasted so much time high and all the friends I lost when I was getting high all the time. As of January I've started meditating daily and reading a little more but apart from that I haven't made much progress. I am very behind on all my work for uni and have a lot of decisions to make about my future that I have no idea how to make, but at least I'll be sober when I make them. I have really been struggling with my mental health recently and was suicidal last week and have no idea how to handle my emotions but I really want to begin to improve things for myself.",6

They checked my blood alcohol level and it said 0.00 that was the first time  in idk how long I could say that I was completely sober.

When I went in I was at my most Vulnerable state I have ever been in and it was the most traumatizing moment of my whole life.

Today I have a lot of emotions to think where I once was a year ago. How I had let alcohol take over my life and keep me locked up in this cage I could never get out of. It put me in a place where I weak, scared, and had no voice.

When I went into the hospital I was looked at and treated like someone who was on drugs and was told over and over again I was a heroin addict because how sick I was. Shaking, unable to breathe or stand on my own the nurse could careless. After getting assessed by the nurse they took me to a room to lay down on a bed

This was the beginning of Covid and the hospital was out of masks. They had paper towels folded in half with rubber bands stapled to the sides. They put one on me when I first got there. I already couldn’t breathe as it was and they tell me to lay down to put in an IV. When I laid down the paper towels went into my mouth and nose. I was suffocating 

I sat up so I could breathe. The nurse called for for someone to come put in the IV. When someone came to help she got on the bed and held the mask over my mouth and nose making it so I couldn’t breathe at all. 

As I laid there in tears thinking this was how I was going to die. Thinking I put myself here. Making myself so weak and vulnerable I could not fight back. It was the scariest moment of my life.

She held the mask over my face she yelled “Lay the fuck down! We’re in the middle of a pandemic you little shit!” I had used my last drop of energy trying to sit up so holding me down wasn’t something she needed to do. I wasn’t fighting because I couldn’t. I was on the verge of passing out so she climbed off the table so I could breathe. Heroin

After multiple try’s they finally got the IV in. The nurse continued to say I was on heroin and treated me like it too. She asked if I was cold because I was shaking, but then told me that sucks. A doctor would come in and turn off the lights so I could rest and she would come in the room just to turn them on because a drug addict doesn’t deserve sleep. After being there for what felt like a lifetime, I finally had stop shaking and had gained some strength back. When the nurse came back in and started telling me that I was on Heroin again I used everything I had in me to yell at her “I don’t do fucking heroin!!!!” She called me a lair and left the room. 

She came back into the room and told me she had talked to my husband. My husband told her that I had a substance abuse problem. She then yelled at me saying that when someone says they have a substance abuse problem that means drugs not alcohol. She told me that alcohol is not a substance. Never once did she apologize. Never once did she even look like she felt bad. It was seriously the scariest moment of my whole life. 

Fucked up people are out there and will take advantage of you when ur that weak it’s soooo horrible. But everyone has a different path to sobriety but I pray to god yours is nothing like mine. You just gotta tell yourself your better then all this!! Don’t put yourself in the position I did, don’t make urself almost die to get sober. Do it for you, do it to be happy again, do it to feel good inside and out! I can honestly say sobriety is a beautiful thing and will make life so much better you just gotta believe in yourself.... and I believe in you... you can do this just be strong",7

Thursday night I remember drinking beers
Going to my room about 6, I had started drinking straight gin..it Was in my water bottle but I don’t remember doing that. I don’t remember taking at least 10 oxazapam.. I had also had four mg of Xanax during the day.. one before I drank. Incredibly stupid I know. I don’t remember having sex at all with my partner. The last thing I remember is drinking gin. I also took around 10 seroquel apparently.

I was filled in what happened by my bf . I slumped over after talking absolute nonsense. Boyfriend helped me and realised I was passed out. I guess he noticed I wasn’t breathing properly. He called 000 and they said tell me when you feel a breath.. he waited 30 seconds and I made a rattle..then labourerd breathing. Then I threw up clear liquid, BF scooped it out of my mouth as much as he could. He saved my life. He kept my neck up and kept doing sterem rubs which hurt like hell now.. I responded to them like a drunken fool. Then I stopped responding to them. When the paramedics came after an hour and a half I was 34 degrees. My blood pressure was 80 over 40. I was strapped to a spinal bed and taken to a small local county hospital, where perhaps I was intubated. I don’t know. I don’t remember any of this. At all. 

I was a code 1 emergency when the first paramedic got there and had 2 cop cars and 3 ambulances at the house. A helicopter landed for me, because I needed to be in an ICU. The small county town doesn’t have one, and the bigger hospital that is closer wasn’t sure if the my could take me. Then apparently they had a bed or I wasn’t stable enough to fly to the major city hospital . I don’t know. A cop came and told my dad that I was going to the bigger hospital about half an hour away.

At 7am I woke up up choking on a tube that I couldn’t get out. I was choking on it for a while and started crying because it felt like I was dry drowning or something. Someone yelled for a nurse and I guess they took it out. It felt amazing to be able to breathe on my own. 

I don’t remember being told what happened to me,  or if I was lucky to survive. I believe I was, my boyfriend ( who lives in another state is leaving early because this was too much for him. I don’t blame him.. I just am heartbroken.: I desperately need him right now but he’s leaving anyway today.. he needs to take care of his mental health) It was 50/50 that I woke up without brain damage they told him, I wasn’t told this. When I had been awake for a while. I half remember talking to a social worker who recommended I should talk to the police. Idk. A cop came, he asked if I wanted to make a statement, against who I asked? No one, just my recollection. I am scared of what I said. I don’t remember. I was out of it and felt like the social worker was pushing for me to speak to the police so I said yes. I asked him am I making a statement against somebody and he said no, just a statement about what I remember. I asked what happens next and he was incredibly vague, and said he didn’t know, they were waiting for toxicology reports. Idk what will happen with that.
I would not speak to the police sound of mind. I kept falling asleep while speaking to him. He was recording. I signed what he wrote down. I don’t remember what I said.

I am scared because I don’t remember taking those pills.

I was discharged to my dad, who didn’t even know I had an appointment Monday. I need help. I hope I can receive it. I have a serious pill problem.
Why was I discharged. why does a mental health nurse deem me fit to leave less than 12 hours after I was on life support. I don’t understand. It feels surreal and hasn’t sunk in.",3

I’ve been suicidal since i can remember- first attempt was 8 years old. I’m stuck, like many others, in the vicious cycle of-

Build me up, tear me down,
“Fill the void”, strip away any peace you found,
Thrive in psychosis, it’s better than my reality now,
Give me a will to live as you rot me inside out,
Keep me alive so i can watch myself until i hit the ground. 

Point is, I’ve depleted the last of my sanity, happiness, and sources to buy that false peace. I’m not going to make it through this. Rehabs, psych wards, 15 years of therapy (I’m 20).. i try to save myself from myself but I’m exhausted of running in circles getting nowhere. 

I have DID (diagnosed) and genuinely feel like I’m living with a murder- suicide=homicide. It sounds insane but i guess this is my last cry for help. I don’t know what I’m asking for right now, but i have nothing to lose by posting this. It’s going to get really bad, it’s inevitable. So anything anyone says I’ll take to heart. 

Sorry this is a ramble, I’m just so afraid of being the 5th suicide in my family since I’ve been alive. I’m absolutely petrified because the only thing keeping me from suicide is going to kill me.",8

She's still drinking to the point of blacking out almost every day, she's either not taking her meds and having seizures or she is and getting even more blackout, and she's constantly lying to everyone. She tells other people that my parents don't care about her (they've literally put their entire lives on hold to look after her), she goes from sad to manipulative/abusive in an instant, she lies about where she goes and whether she's drunk, and she threatens to kill herself when we suggest hospitalization. It's really bad. I've decided to get myself sterilized, largely because the idea of having a child that goes through this when I'm in my old age is one of the worst things I can imagine.

I've gotten to the point where, frankly, I find it really difficult to care about her. I'm exhausted. I'm sick of that feeling of dread every time I get an unexpected call from my parents. I'm sick of good days being ruined because she's gotten fucked up and I have to help pick up the pieces. I've accepted that there is only so much I can do. If she wants to drink herself to death, so be it.

My younger brother feels the same way. If anything, he's dealt with the majority of her shit. But my parents (who she's staying with) are being absolutely wrecked by this. They're both husks of their former selves, the last 4-5 years have aged them by two decades. I now care about helping them out.

So... what do I do? How do I convince them that they need to just let her go fuck her own life up and that they need to accept that they should also look after themselves? They want to travel, for fuck's sake. They want to see the world and retire in some small country cottage by a lake. They want to go for bike rides in the evening instead of watching their alcoholic daughter in case she does something dangerous.

They deserve to enjoy these years, and she is draining the life out of them. How do I help them?

2021-04-24 09:31:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mxk0xd/sat_here_with_the_horrible_restless_feeling_of/,Sat here with the horrible restless feeling of wanting to get fucked up and not sure what to with myself,"I have bipolar disorder (and OCD) and so I have recently stopped drinking for good after decades of blacking out every single time and doing some awful things with awful consequences. Have also abused coke, pills, snorting speed amongst other things. Most recently I mainly abuse weed because, although less harmful to my illness in the short term, once I have it I keep having it and it ramps up from a way to quiet the thoughts and the tics now and then to an every time I wake up, sneaking onto the porch before my wife gets up, sneaking it when I take the trash out kinda thing within days. I get addicted very easily. Although I have only had one bad relapse since stopping drink (I don’t think I am an alcoholic, it’s just one of the things I will abuse if it is ‘there’) that is what I currently have on hand and I’m worried. If I had something to smoke I can guarantee I would be smoking it now which I would be fine with I guess, not ideal even doing that though. So my thoughts turn to drink and my prescription drugs of which I have many. 

I used to think this restless feeling when I was younger was me wanting to create. To paint or write a song or work on some cartoon strips or prints. I couldn’t ever settle and felt like I should be doing some unknown creative project. Undoubtedly a little hypomania coming in at those times.

But now, as I’m older, I’ve figured that it is just a feeling of wanting to be fucked up. When I am straight time just does it’s thing and I have to fill it all with stuff. Tasks. And if I don’t I am terrified of having no list to work from. A physical list I carry around to check off boxes and some are literally pet the dog, drink a glass of water. It helps to an extent but not this kind of mood. 

I’m sat here struggling not to open the bottles. I don’t know what to do other than fidget.

I haven’t ever spoken to someone about this stuff professionally. Like a group or whatever it is people do. Like so say, I don’t think I’m an even an alcoholic... just a holic (not sure that’s a word)

That’s that’s too long sorry",33

I have has minor issues with it like taking it daily twice before like separate occasions. 2020 man. I was taking an insane amount of research chemical benzodiazepines, plus I’d buy Xanax like 60-80 bars, I had a klonopin prescription. I don’t know the attraction to the feeling of how far gone I was. I only did klonopin and Xanax before the pandemic after clonazolam ruined me. I was taking like enough that the bottle he said I’d have for a long time, I’d do half at a time at my worst. I could take 18 Xanax and not feel anything. I remember my dealer telling me to try different research chemicals. I wasn’t interested at first actually. For some reason I tried a dissociative one like ketamine. Hated it. Bought more. Then I have no idea how on earth how far gone I was that he suggested meth. At first I was like ew no but he said it was so euphoric and I battle depression so the word euphoric ... got me after convincing. Meth isn’t big here. And oh I forgot molly and found it. I dis molly the onw day drug like k next day molly next day k ana benzos I’m between. Then meth. So I got it and I remember a huge line and just waking up. No euphoria. So idek when it happened. I did half a g at once . That felt euphoric i don’t remember how long. I remember it in a very foggy way. The psychosis came though. I had horrible seizures. I was hallucinating. The hallucinations when I picture them I get sketched out. They scared me so badly. I started just acting nuts. My boyfriend was scared. I was screaming nonsense I believed he was screaming for me so I ran to help him. Anyway he was scared I was going in and out and I said call 911. He did. I was taken to a hospital. I had seizures over and over. Worst experience of my life. I was really sick for weeks before this really got out of control and that happened. I was also being abused and treated badly by my boyfriend. Plus I’m an addict and I went nuts though this time. What do I do when I get out of the hospital. Buy an 8 ball. Like day 2? Continued using benzos and although a prescription id use them improperly and also buy extra. I started psychedelics..The benzo use got out of hand. I lost who I was. I would take enough benzos to get so high and I’d end up falling asleep. I made the worst decisions like I was a wreck. I’d get minor seizures still too. I’d leave the house at 1am
to talk on the phone. My by bf would roll over when I go home at 4 am and be like where were you? Flip on me and I had the audacity to be annoyed with with him. I was selfish. Manipulative. Gaslighting. I was being abused though. Everything got bad. I lost 2 jobs. I was constantly on and off and fighting with my boyfriend. I was going to lose everyone and I agreed to treatment. I got scared and didn’t go but I said I was going to outpatient to my bf but I got completely clean myself. I started seeing myself again. I truly didn’t want to use again. From October to now I wasn’t going to use. Yet I started using benzos again. My Adderall has is getting frequent because. I have “e” just in case. My friend came and told me she was clean from fentanyl all the withdrawals. She is clean from heroin and fentanyl now. I asked her why she ever did h and fentanyl and she described it and I was thinking maybe one day. I’m so messed up. Why do I like being high?  I hurt so many people ruined my life and I’m risking this again?!",1
2021-04-24 00:51:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mxcx2y/update_on_myself_and_question/,Update on myself and question,"Hi everyone,  
It feels weird making my second post here, especially since I haven't improved since I last sought help with you gentle people. It's gotten a lot worse.

I think it's been about 8 months to one year since my alcohol, benzo and cocaine habit got worse. I can't pinpoint the exact date since I really started abusing drugs, but I guess it's 1 - 2 years and going.   
I have been seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist for +-3 years; even though I cant wish for any better or more affordable help, things don't seem to change for me. 

I can go a couple of days without alcohol or coke, and I was able to stop taking lorazepam for some weeks on my own. What's getting worse is when I decide to have a drink (i.e. convince myself I'll only get one bottle of wine this time and try to sleep on time), I end up finishing the bottle, scoring 3 g's of coke, buy another bottle and a six pack, and stay up for another 24 hours or more. It feels like I can't stop drinking or doing a fat line of coke every 20 mins from the moment I start; lately I've given up pretty quickly. I really just want to ask some practical questions: has anyone had a similar issue in the past, and do u have any advice on how to find damage control for yourself? Is there a chance I can learn to have a drink again like most people can, without spiraling out of control? 

And lastly, if anyone could share any advice on how to get something inside your stomach or release some tension on it when you're high on coke, I would really appreciate it. I'll often go for 24 hrs+ without eating because I just can't.

Thanks a lot for listening to me.",1

Long story short I think I am addicted to feeling fucked, no specifics. This I guess means it is a mental addiction as opposed to physical which is either a better or worse place to start from LOL. I think my issue’s boredom, and also an interest in almost pushing my boundaries of what I can complete to a ‘normal’ level while on something. 

I have pretty much been on ketamine/speed continuously for the last few months, doing other things on the side. No one around me has noticed - this is not me being oblivious, I would be screwed if people did notice. I am still managing to meet up with people and do all my work on time and stuff and so I haven’t really taken it that seriously but now I can feel it in my bladder n in my mind. I’m at the point where I don’t have to be on it but if I’m not then I’m kind of thinking about it and if there’s a chance for me to do it then I will bc why not? I’m aware of the health problems but can’t stop because of those, however I can make sure that if I have something important coming up I will be sober for it. I can be on drugs around family and friends and act normal so I don’t really know what to do as it isn’t externally noticeable enough for anyone to intervene. 

What I think I am looking for is toget clued up on what to do. I don’t particularly want to be sober bc I enjoy being high, but I don’t want it to be something I have to do to get by and can’t afford. I want a good relationship with drugs and also want my body to be healthy.",6

One of my Friends said “hey we’re all into it, just embrace it.” I am truly bothered by what they are doing and I am wondering if there is anything I can do to help, because I am outnumbered when I comes to wanting and not wanting to vape.",0

My biggest thing is that while he is trying to recover from Adderall addiction, he has been still smoking weed and drinking. He told me that those would be rare occurrences, and he has already gone back on that and smoked like 4 times this week. I feel so uncomfortable when he is high, and when I tell him that he flips out and says I am a controlling bitch. Last night we had a great night and right before we were going to get intimate he came upstairs and laid down and I noticed he was high.

My mum is in need of help and I just don’t know how to do it, she’s been a long time smoker of weed and has been on methadone for a number of years (20+ from what I understand, I only found out last year)
Last year we lost my dad to a short battle with cancer and in the 8 weeks from diagnosis she started drinking heavily, it put a rapid decline on her health and as a result she ended up on a resus ward days after my dad died. She’s rarely been herself since, before all this she was very high functioning, could just about hold a job down and got on with every day without any problems, raised me and my siblings well. But since the drinking started she’s unable to carry out basic tasks, has lost her driving license, struggles to pay bills etc. 
She’s recently been told if she doesn’t stop smoking then she’ll suffer heart failure. She has been starting to cut back her drinking just before this but very slowly, but I know she won’t be able to stop smoking, it’s a day since she was discharged from hospital and she’s already smoking. 
Short of spending my life savings on putting her through a rehab centre that might not work I don’t know what to do, so if there’s any advice that you can give I’d be very grateful",3

If you asked me 4 months ago, I would have said that at the very least, I'd be on subs for the rest of my life, or more likely dead in the near future. I came off my subs (once again) and spent a few weeks shooting speedballs and drinking constantly before finally going into treatment in January.

I don't feel amazing by any means, but I am working on myself for the first time ever, which is pretty cool.

I overindulge in food, drink, drugs, and love. I have been listening to Audiobooks and YouTube videos in lieu of professional help as I have no insurance. I smoke pot everyday even on the job which has caused many close calls while driving but yesterday I actually had an accident. Nobody was injured and the damage is minimal but the shame and realization that I've hit rock bottom hit me hard. I pulled myself together to face the music should they drug test me and to seek help.

All day I worked to prepare to deal with the fallout for my actions and was feeling confident that I had turned a point. The past week has been an ugly one with panic attacks, struggling with abandonment trauma, but did include a college campus tour which was a particularly high point in my journey. Some hope for once yknow for the future.

My girlfriend texted me a bit throughout the day and called when I was dealing with the police at the scene. When I got home she was already off work and showering. We sat down and talked and she expressed her anger at me for being selfish and reckless. She is right to be and I agreed, reiterating that I have been open about my addiction and that I thought I had already hit rock bottom when I got randomly drug tested months ago and she asked her adult child to provide pee so I could pass. That was devastating to learn and I would have never requested that and while I did go along it killed me and filled me with revulsion and shame for myself.
She is rightfully angry as she comes from two emotionally manipulative marriages. She never wanted to be back in a life like that and now I have made her feel like those men. 
I expressed my desire to get help and acknowledged over and over that I am am an addict and that I have a problem and that I wish I were reasonable and sensible enough to simply take care of the problem on my own with no help other than passive acceptance and forgiveness. While she said she loved me she did agree that she didn't want me in the house that night. I have struggled with core wounds of abandonment since my dad died when I was 6 and my mom and that side of my family are not accepting of me. I respected her request but feel betrayed and abandoned. I have no support system save for her and her daughters. I did not get a loving and supportive intervention like you see on tv. Instead I was sent away from our home weve shared with not even a friendly couch to crash on. I know I'm broken and I don't want to hurt my family anymore. I want to get better so I can show up for them but spending the night sleeping in an office chair at my office knowing my dog and girls are home hurting but not wanting me there doesn't make me feel supported. And I don't think I would have ever sent anyone I loved away like that, ibb be don't want to turn this around on anyone. My addiction my problem but am I so wrong in feeling let down too?",5

I can understand having a drink to get your mind right, but any time of day i can just have as many shots or drinks as i please, i can handle myself but being in that enviroment is killing me. My new job will also be as a cook, but i love and am passionate about legitamately putting dishes together, its a from scratch restaurant and things seem to be in line there, so im excited for something new(i am rambling, i apologize). Tonight i got off work, had so many drinks in a short amount of time i got home(did not drive) and passed out almost immediately. Woke up and wanted to CONTINUE drinking, so i did, got ahold of my old cocaine dealer and took a gram(at least) to my face, continued drinking, and now here i am, hating myself for doing it, making an anon account just to this shit off my chest. I just wanna be better and i hope this new chapter brings happiness and change that i desperately need and want.

I bought a gram and a half of coke. I did about half of it before getting rid of the rest. I was 17 days clean and I messed all that up just to feel good for a few hours. I could’ve died tonight because I mixed coke and poppers without knowing how dangerous of a combo that was. That was a wake up call. I’d never been afraid for my life because of drugs before. I blocked all my dealers and made a pros and cons list for doing coke. There’s a lot of cons and only 1 pro. I also wrote down what triggers me to use too. I felt awful about what I was doing the second I hit up my plug, and I feel pretty bad about everything still. But I learned a lot tonight. And I think I’m ready to move forward in my journey toward sobriety. I’m armed with reasons to stay clean and I’ve made it pretty damn difficult for myself to even get my hands on the stuff. I wish I hadn’t relapsed, but I’m glad I was able to grow a bit from it. I did some of the hard things that I should’ve done to begin with. And hell, I could’ve honest died or ended up in the hospital because of the choice I made. I’m taking it as the world giving me one last warning.

2021-04-22 04:16:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mw04xv/23_year_old_i_think_im_addicted_to_meth_but_want/,"23 year old, I think I'm addicted to meth, but want to stop","Just a quick background of how I started. I was always a horny guy even when very young found porn online at 12 and went onto Grindr at 14, met an older guy lots of time. This one time if asked if I wanted to try T, he showed me what it was and not really thinking or knowing I said yes. Don't remember much just how horny and how hot I got. 

Anyway fast forwarding from 14 to 18 I didn't do much meth but did slam once, mostly just met up with guys in cars. Then moved out of parents for uni it wasn't till my 3rd year of university did I start doing Meth again, this time I was living with a friend and was single I went a bit crazy at this point, getting high lots, meeting tones of guys, at one point had been awake and barely eaten for 8 days going to and from orgy to ogry. Only going if they had meth of course. Would slam very really has I hatre needles and blood but loved the rush. 

Then near the end of my 3rd year at uni I meet my boyfriend. I remember our first date, I was an hour and a half late, coming straight from a orgy. MY phone had died so had no way of messaging till it was charged more. He still waitied (tho he made it up for being an hour and half late on our second date lol because of cancelled tran) 

Anyway after the usually dates and talking for a few months. I asked him to be my boyfriend, he said yes. Just before this ( I was still doing meth and meeting other guys, though less.) But stoped as soon as we got officially together. Along with this I stoped all drugs completly and honestly it was easy, had no withdraw symtems and was doing great, I graduated university with a BA with honours First class and did lots of traveling. It wasnt until 2020 hit where everything went south, it's been a hard year for everyone but I'm just not sure what to do anymore. 

Due to Covid and lockdown I was stuck alone for 8 weeks, because me and my boyfriend didn't live together and his family doesnt know he's gay, we could not see eachother. This is where I started using again. During lockdown looked through  my old phone to see if I still had the number to a dealer I used to buy off. Turns out still worked even a year and half later (that's how long I had been sober for) 

Thanks to the number still working I was able to order drugs for the first time. Before I used to meet guys who either new dealers or where one/ brought it. Was a little nervous but was very easy and.quick. I live in a big city and drugs are very easy to get here.

From here is where i lost control and became a addict. I would stay up 3 or 4 days every week,  getting high playing with toys massive porn addict. Then eventually it wasn't enough I was so horny and started looking around online, discovered these PnP zoom rooms and online groups all about chem play. Which then lead me into doing something I regreted, went from just online chats and cam. To actaully meeting a guy to get high and fuck around with. Despite having a boyfriend for over a year who I loved. Though I loved my boyfriend We didn't have that much sex and definitely not sex that involved using drugs, I started off as being only bottom but became Vers because my boyfriend was bottom. We didn't discuss sex before hand never even sent a nude pic, was very opposite to the life I was leading which is probably why It felt so good. But because of this I had the biggest urge to be fucked and breed. As it had been so long. And thanks to the drugs it increases that 1000x 

To fast forward to today it's been a year now since I started at my tolerance is thought the roof, I now buy 3 or so grams every week, which is making me very poor. I still work full time and live in shared accommodation with my own bathroom. But am lossing control. I have always been so good at balancing both the intense drugs and responsible daily life but now I am constantly late for everything. Constantly loosing or breaking stuff. And constantly making a mess when I can't find it (which I hate as I'm a massive clean freak) it's been a really hard 6 months with my grandad passing and my uncle having stage 4 brain cancer. My whole family has been dealing with so much sadness. Which is why I'm struggling so much this time with trying to stop. The drugs keeps you up and happy. But it's got to the point that I have not had a come down since Christmas. Being high every day, sleeping amount 3 or so nights a week. Still going to work and still with my boyfriend who 4 days. Week. Somehow in-between all of that I'm also doing 3+ grams of T only smoking now. A lot of online stuff, and meeting guys now and again. All without anybody in my life knowing. There are some points where I've been up for 4 days and have work do will just do some clouds to keep awake. I do still get the rush for doing T but have gone to some extreme measures to try and hit that high. And it's starting to take over my life. All day and night tweaking. 
 
With my only comedowns as 18+ hour crashes where I sleep for days at a time.

I really need some advice or any medication that might help. Mostly with not feeling so tired and drained. Would help ease of it if I wasn't to tired to go to work. 
I want to stop for so many reasons, money being one. But the main one being that I hate what I've done behind my boyfriends back, we've been together almost 3 years now and it's still so amazing with him. Couldn't of got throught the last year without him. 
I love him and want to stop this horrible secret life I've been leading. And focus on him and my future.0",10
2021-04-22 03:36:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mvzofl/my_experience_with_clonazolam_powder_the_worst/,My experience with Clonazolam powder. The worst withdrawal i've ever been through.,"Last year I ordered 500mg of clonazolam for only 50€ (\~60$) and thought I had made to deal of a lifetime. Since this substance is so potent with a regular dose being at 0.2-0-3mg I calculated that a single dose would cost me about 0.025€ (0.03$) compared to the 0.5€/$ I usually pay for a Clonazepam pill of similar strength, which is 20 times as expensive. This in the long term would save me a lot of money, especially considering my low income and my relatively high expenses for benzos. So the choice of buying it was quite easy.

Since its so dose-sensitive the only thing that made sense to me was to dilute it in PG (Propylene Glycol) at the ratio of 1mg/ml and then measuring each dose with a 1ml syringe. This part was easy and worked as good as one can hope for.

The problem however came when I realised that Clonazolam is significantly more hypnotic that Clonazepam, making it harder to do regular every day thing (working, socialising etc.) And also that tolerance for the substance developed more quickly compared to Clonazepam. Normally things like this aren't that big of a problem for me since I then usually then end up using all the drugs up and then decide not to buy more. But for clonazolam I had more than 2'000 doses in my inventory, and having a longstanding problem with addiction I wasn't able to throw it away (which in hindsight, I should have when realizing it was going to become a future problem).

So I ended up using it for several months and at the end my daily dosage was about 1.5mg, 3 times a day (=4.5mg/day). So when I finally ran out of the stuff I started to get the worst benzo withdrawal symptoms i've ever experienced with HEAVY headache 24/7, completely unable to sleep without any sleeping aid (although I had mirtazapin which helped quite good, but I also quickly developed tolerance to this which quickly became problematic), I also had huge amounts of anxiety and irritability which lead to me having constant depressing and suicidal thoughts. **And all this while trying to taper the substance by replacing it with 5x10mg Diazepam per day** (and then gradually reducing the dose).

It took me almost three weeks before my situation slowly started to get better, and those were LONG three weeks with me unable to work and having a real hard time doing anything at all basically. Is spent my days mainly watching youtube in order to try to get the time to pass more quickly.

So my word of advice is to think twice before buying clonazolam in powder form (or any benzo in powder form in large quantities for that matter). And if you do, try to keep a strict dosing schedule and plan ahead for the day when you run out by mainly trying to start replacing it with Diazepam (or other replacements that you see fit, although diazepam is usually recommended at the best one) long before you run out of your benzo-liquid, in combination with lowering the dose of the dissolved dose.

I've been through benzo withdrawal about five times before, with Clonazepam being the worst, but nothing is comparable to this. After all this I'm at a point where I don't want to do benzodiazepines ever again, and regret ever starting. My problems (social anxiety) are still there and by calming them with benzos I only temporarily shoved them at the back of my head, making them come back stronger than before; instead of dealing with them and growing as a person.

EDIT: I'm doing a lot better now and can finally start living a normal life again.",2

Family cannot afford $20,000 for 30 days. (Treatment facilities in California)","Hello. First time posting. 

My sister (F35) after 7 years is ready to get sober. She was recently held on a 51/50 and spent 14 days in a mental facility. She was released to my elderly father 2 weeks ago and she has had the cops called on her a total of 6 times, and used (from what she told us) everyday but the passed 3 days. She went to a live in residential facility for 2 days and really liked it. She was unfortunately discharged yesterday because she didn’t have the proper insurance and our family cannot afford her stay. 

Does anyone have any recommendations on how to get her in a live in residential treatment facility in southern California without insurance? Or medical? 

Literally open enrollment ended March 31 (which we missed) and we are desperate. We are not only scared that she will use again but the thought of us calling the cops on her again breaks our hearts and scares us to death. 

As for now she is staying at my parents house and keeping busy by going to doctor appointments and helping with household chores. 

I saw her yesterday and she couldn’t sit still, her foot was tapping and she told me that she cannot just sit still and do nothing. 

We all work 9-5pm and do not have the capacity to watch her 24/7 so getting her in a facility is our number one priority. 

Meth is literally killing her and us.

How best to help them?,"I have a friend who is no doubt an addict. I do not believe he would admit that he is an addict. He abuses his prescriptions, and all sorts of street drugs from simple alcohol or weed, to benzos, opiates, and who knows what else. He is barely surviving, living paycheck to paycheck on a 6-figure salary, blowing everything on drugs.


My closest friends have been trying to help him get help but it's nearly impossible when he is: an adult, doesn't admit he has a problem, and doesn't want to change.


Being friends with an addict is absolutely exhausting. He is failing at work and all aspects of life and we are trying to help him stay afloat. But the way he treats others is basically its own form of abuse. I'm not sure I can continue to be his friend, but I'm worried if we cut him off in a ""tough love"" type act, then he will spiral further downward.


What can we do in such a situation?

""When The Medicine Becomes The Disease""

Illness deep in the flesh,
A genetic downfall opposite the best,
Flickers of light in the darkness
Of your willpower it is a test.
Such brightness drowns out the rest
Of pain and madness,
But with it, it brings more.
A darkness darker than dark,
An emptiness filled with void, 
And a loneliness befriended 
With not even itself.
A hole lays in the chest 
Of a man he once was,
But now all is left
Is a shell, 
So fragile, so weak
One beam of light,
Stronger than them all,
Will lead
To the poor man’s fall.
Habitual return to this light,
Consciously helping the disease,
Feeling bad
But finally feeling right.
The values and morals
Of which he once held,
Vacant in his mind.
A mind that grasps a feeling,
But loses its grip on life.
It painfully loses its grasp of reality
And its grasp of relationships,
Damaging those around,
But to the medicine he is bound.
Burning down bridges
Till they’re nothing but ash,
And a few forgotten pictures.
But illness is not forgotten,
So it is replaced
By a sinister haste
To leave this state
Leaving behind
The freedom of life.
The sickness begins to fly
And the whimpers turn to cries,
The tainted truth evolves
To full blown lies.
Attempts to leave its grasp
Result in poignant tries
All in an effort
To one day,
Face the clear blue skies.
Shivers and shakes
Now define his true self,
Because happiness and joy now hide
Between where euphoria and depression
Now permanently reside.
A breath of fresh air
Reawakens the mind,
But not far in the distance
A storm rolls in
To destroy the freedom
Of the clear blue sky.
The storm slowly destroys 
Everything in its path,
But its welcoming arms
Are so hard to deny.
Acquaintances lose control,
And friends start to die.
The only light fades dimmer
And the choices become slimmer,
The only way out,
Feels to him
Like he must leave this life
Before the lights get too dim.
Life begins to speed up,
And the substance stops working.
Nothing seems okay
And now the sick man,
Slowly rotting and grey,
Must steal to live another day.
Lying unconscious
On the livingroom floor,
Playing cat and mouse
With an evil fate.
A poor child will one day stumble 
Into his sick father
On his final day.
And now
The disease will continue it's rape,
Now to a young boy
Who will look for an escape.",6

Points are:","- I’m introverted, so real-life interactions just drain me unlike online ones, which are much more sustainable

- 90% of my friend-groups from all walks of life and all kinds of interests exist on the computer in places I can access fairly easily, so giving up the computer would be giving up friends

- I help people, council people, create art, write interesting stories, etc. on the internet with people, so it’s fulfilling.

- I enjoy all the things you can do on the Internet: Not just playing games but role-playing, attending virtual events, meeting new people, etc. Like... as far as I’m concerned, this is the same as an extrovert being addicted to going out and doing things with people in real life, so it’s not like it’s a harmful addiction necessarily (arguably safer than going out with real people too), it’s just:

It’s still discouraging me from doing anything I don’t find enjoyable, which—again—sounds totally reasonable because why would anyone *not* wanna just enjoy themselves given the chance, but obviously, it’s sadly gotta change so I can sustain myself in the future.",1

Or so I thought they were  
Lifetime going with the grain  
Has all become a blur

Call me crazy to have thought  
That things were copacetic  
Years spent in false complacency  
Have made me so pathetic

Days will turn to months and years  
Since I have killed the past  
Told myself no matter what  
This will not be my last

Just as I have let myself  
Fall victim to addiction  
I’ll build myself a new routine  
With absolute conviction

No more time for halfway hope  
Won’t let bad habits slide  
The only way I’ll feel at home  
Is changing what’s inside

Bear with me now as I expose  
My sickness and my fears  
I let them in and they took all  
The things that I hold dear

I still can’t seem to spell it out  
The secret that I keep  
So if you asked I wouldn’t tell  
The guilt has dug too deep

But if you say that honestly  
You want to help me through  
Then ask away and I’ll explain  
What I’ve been clinging to

This time I hope the loss will make  
Me conquer this fixation  
I have to keep my willpower  
For the full duration

I’ll keep myself away from things  
That push me to the brink  
Should be enough to start anew  
At least that’s what I think

Off I go to the unknown  
Not knowing what I’ll find  
Everything will be okay  
If I control my mind",5

They tell you all you have to believe is in the possibility of a higher power, and I even struggle with that.

Hi, I’m new here. Just found this sub, first post.

Since I (F33) was in high school, a lot of people that  I was aquaintances with or maybe hung out with a few times have overdosed and passed away. However, until recently, I hadn’t had anyone that I was super close with (or family) pass away. My grandfather passed away 10 years ago, but I grew up in CA, while he lived in MI and I only saw him once a year or so. He was also sick for a very long time and we knew it was coming. 

In 2016, a friend who was like a brother to me, who I grew up with, was hit by a car while riding his bike. I’m really close with his sister, and I grew up with them. That was the first time that I felt significant loss. 

The day before Christmas Eve(2020), one of my best friends was found dead. She was 35 and had 2 young children. I met her in 2010 when I moved from California to Tennessee, and she was one of my first friends there. We worked together for years and became very close. Her and her husband helped me through the most difficult time of my life and got me out of an abusive situation, and I’ll never forget that. 
In 2019, I moved from Tennesse to Pennsylvania, but I still kept in close contact with her. She had always been a drinker, didn’t drink every day, but when she did, she drank excessively. I guess sometime after I moved, her drinking became significantly worse. I didn’t see it, and she didn’t tell me much, but her husband divorced her, largely due to her drinking habits. She had a really, really rough year or two. I kept in contact with her as much as I could, my husband and I even helped her pay a few bills when she was going through her divorce. She was struggling, but she seemed to be doing better. The last time that I spoke to her, she was in good spirits, and she had started dating someone.  A few days later, she messaged me several times through out the day. I didn’t even open her messages because my husband and I had some things that we were dealing  with. A few days after that, I woke up to a Facebook post announcing that she had died. 

I thought that I was reading the post wrong at first. I had to have been confused, there was no way that the post said what i thought I was reading. It was the day before Christmas Eve. 

I opened the last messages she sent me. It was her birthday that day. She sent me messages saying that she was having a horrible day, she was stranded at a gas station, out of gas and her card wasn’t working. She was at her wits end and was seeing if I could send her any money.

Yesterday, I spoke with her mother in law and she showed me the medical examiners report.  The cause of death was essentially an UTI/ kidney infection that was untreated and became sepsis. The contributory cause of death was “chronic ethanolism”. I looked it up, and that basically means that she drank herself to death.

This is the first death that has really had a significant impact, because she was a part of my day to day life. I have no idea how to cope, how to grieve. I wasn’t able to go to her celebration of life but I’d like to do something to honor her, but I just don’t know what.",84

“Again, knowledge means knowing, but wisdom means acting—acting on what you know, seeing the person who’s drowning right the fuck in front of you, and stepping in.
My mom’s death ripped something from me that isn’t coming back. But it forced my mind and heart to remember, to accept what I can’t change and get the freedom that comes with that. But ODB taught me—taught all of us—the flip side of that. When we neglect others out of superficial “superficial wisdom, fake respect, phony knowledge—we tell ourselves it’s their life; we say it’s not our responsibility; we don’t want to get involved. Fuck that. Get involved. Or we’ll all feel the pain.”

2021-04-21 00:08:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mv7ww8/long_post_addiction_is_taking_over_my_relationship/,(long post) Addiction is taking over my relationship,"I have been researching, reading books, and trying to do everything in my power to make this work. I have been dating my(f26)  boyfriend(m31) for about 2 years. We have had a fairly tumultuous relationship from almost the beginning, which is hard to acknowledge because there are also so many wonderful parts to our relationship. To summarize, he has a severe Adderall addiction problem. I had no idea for the first year of our relationship, I just thought he had a temper and some PTSD. It was easy for me to take responsibility for most of our issues because I had recently been diagnosed both borderline personality disorder as well as bipolar. I was so ashamed and felt guilty for existing, so any time we had issues I felt like I needed to assume responsibility. I worked so hard on my mental health (I have been in therapy for years) and finally started medication that managed the suicidal/self harm episodes. During my recovery, I noticed that his anger and secretive behavior remained and if anything was becoming increasingly more suspicious. The first time I ever found out he even took Adderall, it was because he ran out and was experiencing severe withdrawals and treating me horribly. He finally broke down and told me why. From then on, we agreed he would be transparent about it. 

Of course that did not happen. He hid it from me and called me crazy and manipulative anytime I asked. He said I was controlling and ruining our entire relationship because I wouldn't mind my own business. It got really bad. Our fights were scary, and they only got scarier. Fast forward another 7. months to about 1 month ago and we had our worst fight yet. He held my dog hostage from me and locked me out of our home. I had to wait over 24 hours (find a random hotel) before I could convince him to let me pick my dog up who is basically my emotional support animal. As soon as I got her, I was advised from my therapist and close family members to get far away for a while. I drove 29 hours across the country alone and stayed with my mother. He freaked out, complete panic attack and flailing. He was begging for me back and apologizing for his part and then flip flopping and telling me it was my fault too. Finally I told him that I love him, but the biggest thing that would need to change is something he is completely unwilling to acknowledge. He asked me to tell him what it was, and I told him that he is severely addicted to Adderall. He broke down and admitted it. I couldn't believe that he was actually aware of the problem. In what I had looked up, the amount he was prescribed alone was far past what is legally acceptable, and was taking more from his friend on top of it. He has been taking it for 13 years. 

After 3 weeks apart, I agreed to come home. We've been here together for almost two weeks. It started out great, he was like a different guy. Calm and loving, so affectionate and open. Slowly things are reverting to what seems to me as how they once were. I keep mentioning it to him and he feels like I'm constantly telling him he's failing, which is true. I see why me putting that pressure on him would make him less likely to succeed, but my trust is so damaged I don't believe anything he says and I'm terrified. I know that I am being overly controlling and he is infuriated by it, but I am worried he won't hold himself accountable to fulfill all of the promises he has made to himself and to me. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if it is possible to move forward, and I'm trying so fucking hard. He is trying hard too. I know he will be going down progressively in his dose over the next however many months, which means more ""madderall"" type explosions. How do I take those with a grain of salt when we are so damaged? 

Sorry for the terribly long post. Looking for any advice at all. I'm lost and don't want to hurt him, and I don't want to hurt myself when I've worked so hard to be in a healthy place.",4

Kratom was great 2 times a week for the last 6 months. 

Last 4 weeks I have been using kratom every day and redosing too and it's becoming an issue, mood swings and shakes and craving. 

Last 2 weeks I was using Etizolam 1mg-4mg for for 5 days and now all gone but at this point no negative withdrawals when it wore off.

From then to now beening using Clonazolam  0.5mg every day and 2-3 days I pushed it to 2mg and sometimes 3mg. 24 hours past yesterday with no dose and before bed I started to feel shit, restless and even minor hallucinations, just slight vision distortion so took 0.5mg and went to bed.  Work up fine and tired and  a little on edge but better.  Slight muscle twitches.  I took kratom then got the withdrawal after, anxiety so took another dose.  Currently in bed and took 2mg Clonazolam from 9pm - 2am and feel ok obviously.

Also Last 4 days I have used 70mg-100mg of IPPH (high tolerence) when I am tired which does cause anxiety.  

I have 1mg Clonazolam left.  How bad is it gonna be or will it just be minor withdrawal but abusing the kratom and IPPH at the same time is enhancing my withdrawals.  I mean I could of slept easy earlier but needed the stay awake so took IPPH. I know man why not use a coffee. So any advice or resurrence thanks guys.",3

Weed -  Probably smoked 2-3 grams worth in my lifetime (I'm 30), I have never had the desire to do it. Probably have turned it down 10x more than I have done it

Alcohol -  I do like to drink on Friday and Saturday for fun, when I had a gf I might drink a glass of wine once a month for years

Video games -  I was sort of addicted to video games until like age 24 from age 8 but it wasn't that bad, I still got good grades, got a good job, worked out etc this was entirely supplemented with CocaCola

I have never been able to get off Coke. I have tried carbonated water, orange juice, diet soda (shit sucks), coke zero, other sodas, cold Turkey, I told my Mom not to buy it when I was a teen but I would still buy it at a gas station.

i've got a bit of a problem with ket. i haven't been able to do any for a little while (around a week? feels like so much longer though). i picked up from my friend/dealer in the afternoon after i had an interview with police for something else drug related. he hasn't let me get any more from him since. 

i've mostly been okay, filling up my time with other things and i went back to school today after easter holidays so i had a good day catching up with my friends. now i feel awful. i feel so mentally tired and depressed. not very long ago one of my closest friends tried to end his life and i found out through his partner that he's physically okay and in hospital at the moment but it was terrifying not knowing whether he was okay or not. i feel so guilty for not checking up on him enough or noticing his mental state. we haven't seen each other in a while and we rarely text but it's one of those friendships that you can always come back to no matter how long it's been. i'm gonna make an effort to spend more time with him and let him know how much i love him but it hurt me so much and i should've been doing that before. i don't know how to cope with things. i've always just dissociated my way out of thinking about it or got so ketted i can barely move but it's hitting so hard right now and i haven't got access to anything. 

i need to sort my shit out. i've got my first round of gcse exams in like a week. i've got an interview for college (uk college, 16-18 year olds not uni) on thursday. my parents, my school and my social workers are on my case after the thing i mentioned with the police. if i get caught using drugs again i'll probably get expelled (only a month left of school) which will fuck up my future not having gcses. i'm looking forward to college next year, doing a music course which i've dreamed of doing for a few years now but i can't make this feeling go away right now and i don't know what to do. 

any help/advice would be appreciated.",5

I’ve had a bizarre ride over the past year or so and I’ve been reflecting a lot. My father has chronic substance use disorder, and I’ve try not to let it bother me. I was living 3 thousand miles away at university until the pandemic made me move back home. My dad has drank everyday for as long as I can remember, now it’s not like he’s abusive or anything, he just gets so wasted every night it’s unbelievable. When I left home to live on my own I felt a sense of guilt that I couldn’t stop him and that I was fleeing the situation. I myself like to drink but as a 4.0 plus student I try so hard not to drink anymore or with him. When I was younger I got loaded everyday until I finally started going to school at 23 and now I’m less then a year away from getting my bachelors and hopefully going to professional school. I posted on here because I’ve never really had a conversation with anyone about these thoughts and I figured I’d give this a try. My dad is 62 and I can’t believe how much he drinks every day, I’d say like a 1/8 to 1/4 a bottle of Jim beam (gallon) and 5 or 6 beer average. Growing up around this and living around this is something I always tried not to think about. I’m not sure how to feel anymore about this situation, in a couple months I’ll be moving out for good and I’ll be 3000 miles away from this situation for an indefinite period of time. Anyway, let me know what you think if you feel the need to respond.

Sorry on mobile and I suck at spelling and grammar

*** I haven't used in 6 weeks. Pls dont use that against me***

So first off i am a time to time user of meth. But I have a female friend that is a daily user. And she IMO is addicted. In the last 4 months she as lost a lot of her family/ good friends. She cheated on her boyfriend 2 times in less than 2 weeks. She dropped her kids off with some ""friend"" of hers that she clams she doesnt have a phone number for nor does she have the persons address just has her on Facebook. Then went to a hotel to use meth. Cus she couldnt do it around the kids. For idk some reason she tells everyone she does meth. The same boyfriend she cheated on told her she was cut off and he wasnt giving her anymore money for the drugs and he knows most the ppl she get stuff from. Hes told all of them not to give her anything. So whats this train wreck of a girl do. She makes up a fake Domestic violence charge against him. Now after cops get involved shit comes out. And she flat out tells DCFS ( Department of Children and Family Services) shes on meth!!!! Blah blah blah. Idk what else. So they tell her she has to go to rehab if she wants her kids back. So now out if nowere shes saying she wants her kids back. But wont stop using. And says she ether wont go to rehab they cant make me or says she will only go cus she has to so she can get her kids back.... I know all this only cus I was there and sober when this stuff happen. Idk maybe more. But I been helping her the last 7 days as she comes down from a 27 day meth bender. Shes sober as of now. I been there 24/7 shes at my house. We been talking about EVERYTHING shes been doing and whats going on. Well she talked to DCFS yesterday and they told her she has to go to rehab to get her kids back. Along with a long list of other shit. So we was talking about getting her to rehab. She says she wont go they cant make her. Or I will go but just to get my kids back..... 

TL:DR friend trashed her life on meth over 4 months.

How can i help her see what this dam drug has done to her life? 
What is the difference from a drug user and a drug addict to YOU?
Am I a hypocrite for telling her she need rehab?
Should I just say Fuck it and drop her as a friend?
Do you thank she should ever get her kids back even after rehab?
Am I an addict if I choose when I use even if I dont destroy my life like she did.",3

For no particular reason, I had the strong urge to use coke again. I craved it very badly, but luckily I wasn’t able to get in touch with a dealer. I couldn’t sleep that night and I spent much of Sunday sleeping. For context, my girlfriend is in another state for mental health treatment and I’m only able to get a phone call from her once a week on Thursdays. I’m also able to get a letter once a week. I usually would’ve gotten a letter by now, and not getting one is making me worried about her. I’d really hoped a letter would’ve come by now since I was really struggling this weekend. This just makes my urge to use that much stronger, because a part of my brain is telling me that everything will be ok if I go out and do some blow. I’ve gotten through Monday but I’m not so confident I’ll be able to make it another day. Can anyone give me any advice on staying clean for just another day at least? I’ve been doing great with my sobriety and I don’t want to throw that all away just because of a few rough days.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the love and support. This day really took a turn thanks to all of you. So much great advice. I’m confident I can make it through the day without a relapsed and I think I can make it at least a few more as well :)",41

now he sleeps a lot so the time he is awake I'm with him all the time, when he sleeps I go to work and visit my family.

I'm trying helplessly to help him but Idk if what I'm doing is right or wrong, I broke his bongs and made him delete the dealers numbers, and I talked to the friend who he hang out with for ice but Idk how I can convince him even when I'm busy that he doesn't need it and I'm not being controlling by doing so.

I'm looking for ways to keep him sober and in the same time assure him that what he's doing is what's best",3

We compliment each other well, share similar values and ultimately want the same thing. After a whirlwind few months together (which have been nothing short of amazing), we have started talking about taking the next steps and moving in together (in the next six months or so, I rent and he owns, so I would move in with him). 

He recently dropped a bomb that gave me extreme pause. He is a heroin addict, using 4-5 times a day. I had never noticed because he would use while I was sleeping, or he would mention his stomach being upset and spending a lot of time in the bathroom. He started using about 15 years ago, then got clean about 10 years ago (after an intervention with his family and rehab). About 2 years ago, he started using again (due to stress with work, covid and depression). 

After confessing to me, he said he wants to get clean, he’s doing it for us and soon he intends on “going cold turkey”. I know very little about drugs in general (maybe smoked one joint in college and don’t really drink myself), so learning he’s been using at my house since we met was a shock, as was watching him use when he first told me. 

I love this man, but I’m a wreck. He is what I’ve been looking for in so many ways, but this makes me question everything. I want to believe he can get clean, but I also know (from research) that addiction is a powerful thing. We both want to have children and obviously this is something that wouldn’t be acceptable with them in the house (obviously, as well as many, many other reasons why this isn’t ok). I also know the process of withdrawal would mean that my needs wouldn’t be met for days (weeks? Months? Years?) and after a string of bad relationships, I know how bad not having my needs met could make me feel. 

Has anyone experiences anything similar? Is true recovery possible? Should I leave him now? I’m afraid if I leave him he will end up using more and more and potentially ending up dead (I know I can’t control his actions but that guilt would kill me). 

Any help is appreciated. Obviously first time posted so apologies if I violated any rules.

Thanks in advance!",8

Before I get into the update, I just want to quickly thank everyone who reached out. Your advice was reaffirming and although I wasn't necessarily comforted by a lot of it, I certainly felt a clearer head.   


Things got a lot worse after writing my last post. Rodney's 24th birthday is at the end of this month and when we still lived together a massive hobby we both shared was record collecting. He got into it because I had a turntable and stereo in our townhouse and he wanted to be able to have records of his own to listen to on it. He was unable/uninterested in getting his own after I moved in with my girlfriend, mostly because he was too preoccupied with his drug use. He'd still buy records with me, but he would only listen to them on my turntable at my house. I sold him my old stereo when I did some upgrading last summer, and the only thing he needed was a turntable of his own to start listening to his records again. I had the idea that, if I got him his own turntable, maybe he would be able to start reconnecting with hobbies again and be able to get his mind right before the heroin use got out of hand.   


I got him a beautiful vintage deck and had it refurbished with a fresh cartridge installed. I decided to give it to him early. Wrapped it and everything and got him a few crates to store his records in since he could take them home now. I invited him over and didn't say anything about a gift (I wanted it to be a surprise), but unfortunately he never showed up. I spam called/texted but got nothing. He eventually called me hours after he was supposed to come by sounding absolutely high off his dome, said he ""fell asleep"" and just woke up. I told him he had to come through the following day to make it up to me. He agreed.  


The next day he got sent home from work as his boss said he was ""visibly inebriated"" and was a ""safety concern"" for the shop. He lost it on his boss and threw everything away by quitting on the spot. This was a new boss at his shop, his old boss who he worked under for over a half decade, completed his entire apprenticeship with, got his certification with, recently moved up in the company and isn't really there to advocate for him now. They tried to talk him out of it but he walked out. Eventually, several hours late, he did make it to my house. He looked haggard, and his voice sounded all creaky and barely coherent. Before he would even talk to me he said he needed to use the bathroom. Stayed in there for a half hour. Came out barely able to stand straight and called his regional manager while completely blasted to yell about how offended he was by what his direct superior had done. I tried to get him off the phone but he essentially just did everything he could to burn that bridge right to the fucking ground. They won't take his calls now.  


He opened his turntable. He cried when he saw it. Thanked me up and down and told me how much it meant to him... then nodded off half way through expressing his gratitude. When he eventually came to he didn't even remember the turntable interaction. Just kept yelling incoherently about how his boss only sent him home cause he feels ""threatened"" and he jealous that Rodney has the highest numbers in the shop. He cycled through that for a few hours. It was excruciating. I mean, I guess I'm the idiot for thinking that buying him the one thing he needed to reconnect with his hobby would fix everything. It hurt my feelings a little bit though, admittedly, that he seemed to lose interest so fast. He was so far removed from logical thought, he didn't even seem like the same person. I felt in that moment the way I assume people do when dealing with belligerent alcoholic family members. From that moment I knew that I was going to have to confront him and tell him that if he wasn't willing to get clean, I was gonna have to take a step back until he was.   


I dropped him off at home that night and helped him bring his stuff up. I needed time to think before going ahead with this. Said goodbyes and just cried into my girlfriends arms for hours. I was just so angry. He knew better. I was furious that he had taken shit this far and now I was gonna lose one of the most important people in the world to me because of drugs. I felt so numb by the time I settled down. It was an awful night.   


I ended up telling our clean friend I mentioned in the last post (I'm just gonna name him Jackson for simplicity) everything, as he worked for a rehab center in our city during his recovery for years and still had connections there. He basically agreed that I had to stop enabling Rodney and agreed with my plan to take a step back.  I took the weekend and spent some time with two of my other close friends, just longboarding around a park in our town enjoying the sunshine to clear my head. Yesterday I went downtown and bought some records for myself and went to the beach with my girlfriend. It was all exactly what I needed just to feel human for a second.  


This morning, Jackson messaged me. Rodney had reached out to him and come clean about everything. The full story I told you guys plus the fact that the only thing he can think about is shooting up and he needs to inject his full daily allotment of hydros (24mg) at once just to feel anything. That he's been doing tons of heroin/fentanyl just to fight off withdrawals. And he admitted that he was in way too deep and was utterly terrified for his life. I messaged him immediately and just said good morning to him and that I hoped his weekend went well. Reminded him I loved him. He told me right away about the conversation he was having with Jackson and he told me he needed to go to rehab. How he needed help. How he just wanted to be happy with his life again and doesn't wanna lose everything. We talked all morning this morning. Rodney told me he made it all through yesterday without shooting any heroin but he cracked this morning. Scraped all his tins for anything he could get. He told me he felt so out of control of himself and he just needs support to get better. He's ready to get clean. He doesn't wanna be just another junkie. We're still messaging back and forth a little. I'm talking to Jackson in the back end.  


Jackson just told me he's pulled some strings to get Rodney in to the rehab that saved his life four years ago. He's getting admitted tomorrow morning. Rodney can't afford it but somehow Jackson has negotiated a reduced rate for Rodney to go and has taken care of his first month's cost (a few grand, not even joking). They're gonna help him get some income assistance and they're gonna accept whatever the government is willing to provide even if it doesn't pay the cost in full. I cried at my desk. I'm so damn proud of him for taking this step and, in a way, I'm also relieved that I didn't need to force it. My boy is still in there. He still cares about himself. He still loves me. And now he's gonna get better. And im back crying at my desk.. haha.  


Thank you again, all of you, for talking me through all this on my last post. I appreciate every one of you.   


TL;DR - He's going to rehab. He ended up realizing how fast he is going down the tubes and made that decision without confrontation from anyone. He gets admitted tomorrow morning and my main focus now is just being there for him.",96

To be true, I don't know about their situation. I might have said things that must've hurt him a lot. I hate to say this but I guess I actually have a narrow perspective about drugs.

I study in Canada (came here in 2018) but I'm from a country in west Africa. The shift to this western society was not a very smooth one. The addiction started when a someone  ( kind of like an ex of mine) that I really liked compared my dick size to her ex and it  was clear I was lacking, (or so I thought). so with my new knowledge of my inadequate size the competitor and perfectionist in me came out. I started finding ways to improve my skill. I was a virgin at the time and was determined to lose my virginity quickly, so i went to a brothel.

why not find another girl, you ask? since my social anxiety increased exponentially I couldn't be composed enough to even talk to a female. this escort addiction has disturbed me financially and mentally. even though I have discovered the secrets to love making and that my size is more than enough I still happen to feel the need to prove to someone that I am very sexually competent. hence why I still get escorts.

I haven't gotten a girlfriend because I'm no longer as determined in school and life as I should be, I will be more of a burden to the young lady. And I'm still lacking in confidence.  I want to stop this addiction. do i just get a girlfriend knowing the relationship will potentially suffer in the end or what do I do?

For context I should state that almost everyone from my hometown does coke, I do it, my friends to it, just about everybody does it. The girl in question I’ll just call her Tay, I’ve worked with tay for about four years, we’ve always been close and tbh I’ve always had feelings for her but she started dating her current bf(who I know and went to hs with)about a week after she started there so I never really had a chance to shoot my shot. Although the current dude is a bit of a loser I wasn’t mad about it at the time cause her ex was crazy abusive, so at least it was a step up for her. The current dude sells coke on the side and I’ve always noticed he does it a bit overealously, I had been also noticing both of them getting skinnier, but she still seemed her regular self so I don’t think much of it. Last night I was drinking with an old friend who knows both of them and he told me she started smoking crack with him years ago and they’re both basically fiends at this point. Hearing this was like getting slapped with a wet fish. Knowing that she’s stuck doing that and I can’t do anything to help her is painful, and now I have to bottle all this information up because we work together. Also the boyfriend apparently owes 20k to dangerous people and if they decide to go after him for that I worry about her safety.  Yet again tho I can’t do anything short of calling the cops which I am not willing to do and prolly wouldn’t help anything anyway. And tbh at this point I feel like I’m caring about somebody who’s already long gone. I don’t really know what advice I’m asking for I found this out last night and now I can’t get my head right and thought ide let it out here",3

I thought I could be happy without you.

I was wrong just like you said.

But I was happy for a little there wasn’t I?

I just wasn’t happy enough.

You knew that too didn’t you?

That’s why you kept calling untilI finally picked up the phone.

I really should block your number.

We talked for hours before I came. We had a lot to catch up on.

I told you about everything I was going through. And you listened like you always do.

You told me to come over. I was hesitant at first.

You made me happy, sure. But you hurt me too.

We aren’t good for each other. Everyone tells me that. 

Then why am I only happy with you?

I don’t love myself I guess. Not like you do. 

Or at least like you say you do.

The longer we stay together, the less you mean it. 

I know you’re lying. But I’m lonely.

And it’s winter now.

I think about you the most when it’s cold.

It was really cold tonight. I guess that’s why I came.

On the phone you told me how amazing I am.

That made me warm.

You were lying again. I know that. 

But false confidence is better than no confidence.

Whenever I leave you make sure to let me know you were lying.

You don’t love me. No one does.

I’m not special. I never was.

But if I never leave I can keep myself warm, wrapped in your lies.

It’s a really cold winter this year. They say a blizzard’s coming.

I really should get back home before it hits. We’ll get snowed in.

But It’s a long walk back to my apartment. And it’s really cold out.

I think I’ll stay.

But it never affected my job I was never late never had bad performance. The past week though I decided I was going to give up my addictions. The first night sober I couldn't sleep at all had to call out the next day for the first time. And then today I was 45 minutes late because it took me so long to get to sleep and then when I was asleep it was like a super deep sleep and I slept right through my alarm. Like I want to be healthy but if it cost me my job is it worth it? Now none of my bosses have said anything to this point because I have such a good track record but I got to figure this out.,2

i grew up with a dad who was in and out of jail all of my life, and a mom who loves her some pain pills. i’ve gotten pain pills and xanax for my mom more times than i could could count. my dad has given me dope when i’ve been sick, or a fresh rig. my mom got into the methadone clinic with me.

and my first relationship was with a guy who had the strangest relationship with his mom, we all lived together. we alll did dope together, smoked crack, pretty much all the “hard” drugs. we were IV users and one thing that has always stuck out to me is she couldn’t hit herself, so he did it for her. shit was pretty wild.

In the process of weening off of the alcohol he bought coke from a new dealer which was unfortunately laced with fentanyl and he passed away. I personally have never been addicted to anything so I don't fully understand the struggle. But for people that do understand, does it ever cross your mind that what you're about to ingest could kill you? I am in no way trying to belittle anyone. I just genuinely want to know if these thoughts could have crossed his mind while he was cutting it on his counter.. did he just think it would help him get straight? Coke calmed him and helped him focus instead of the alternative. Can someone please help me understand in any way?",52

Unfortunately in the world that we like in today, toxicity, complacency, and break-ups have become synonymous with the words \`\`love"" & ""relationships''. There are many contributing factors to creating unhealthy relationships, much of them have to do with dysfunction within an individual. 

There are basic values that we honor for ourselves, but often do not assign as non-negotiables in our relationships. Let's shift away from our pessimistic perspectives on unhealthy relationships and focus on how to build them up. 

These 4 pillars of a healthy relationship will assist in guiding you towards your personal self-development, which will residually impact those around you. Click the link below for the full talk. Share this content if you feel it will bring value to someone's life.

I have been taking 2mg of subs a day (1/4 of an 8mg strip).  I recently cut that in half to 1/8 of a strip which is hard to manage due to size but I dont care.

The withdrawals are worse than ever.   I can deal with the shits, the sweats, the sneezing and flu symptoms but one thing that is really driving me to my breaking point is the RLS and restlessness in general.

What can I do to calm this down? I've had RLS since I was younger so it intensifies tenfold.  I don't want to turn to soma or benzos because I don't want to potentially trigger a reapase.   Can I get something OTC that will work? I tried sleeping pills but for the love of God a half dose and I'm a groggy miserable bastard the next day,  all day.

Basically, I'm about to celebrate my 6 month sobriety checkpoint, but here and there I'm finding old liquor bottles I hid around the house when I was still drinking. 

I came home from work and my wife, in a very loving and understanding way, let me know that she found one of my bottles under the sink. She knew it was old but wanted to check in, which is important.

Still, every time this happens, I immediately feel depressed and guilty. On one hand, finding my hidden bottles reminds me that I had a drinking problem and it helps remind me why I'm staying sober. On the other hand...well, it's just that. It reminds me that I was messed up.

It is 100%, without a doubt, possible. You CAN do this. I know I’m a stranger, but I’m rooting for you. 

Second, youre not a bad person. please read that again. you are not worthless. you are deserving of love, kindness, belonging, understanding, all of it. I know a lot of you might not believe this, but keep telling yourself this, please. You are worthy of a good life. Making bad decisions in the past does not mean you don’t deserve good. Reprogram your mind. It’s hard, but you deserve all the good this world has to offer. Please remember this. 

Third, addiction is highly stigmatized as most of you know. Remember it is a disease. Often times a result of unresolved trauma. Please be kind to yourself. Offer yourself some compassion for how far you’ve come. Remember to celebrate the small victories. Hell, even being on this subreddit reading through trying to get some insight is a victory. You’re trying. Forgive yourself. Be kind to yourself. 

I hope to have a career with those struggling with addiction. I have met the kindest souls in this line of work. You are not your addiction - you are SOMEONE with an addiction. And you deserve life. Please be kind to yourself.

I am watching his life fall apart before my eyes and feel completely helpless to do anything about it.,"[link to update](https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mu74d7/update_my_best_friend_has_crossed_the_point_of_no/)  


I'm no stranger to drugs. I've tried almost anything anyone has ever put in front of me and despite that, I've never struggled with substance abuse at any point in my entire life. Never let any drug become a daily thing (besides weed at certain periods in my life, but ive always been able to cold turkey if necessary) and I'm talking stims, opiates, and everything in between. Never had cravings I couldn't just toss aside. Honestly, I feel like I'm too busy with my job, hobbies and personal relationships to ever have the time to be a drug addict. I just don't have enough time to get high and I'm not in love with it enough to make time. Drugs are just something I do for fun sometimes.

Throughout my life, most of my friends have been similar to me in this way. I've done more drugs than most of them, but only two of friends who have tried as many different substances as I have. One of them was a polydrug abuser who finally got clean in 2017 after some ODs and is still clean to this day, genuinely living his best life. The other is my best friend, who for the sake of anonymity we will call Rodney. We were roommates for a few years until I moved in with my girlfriend in April of last year. We've been through a ton together and have been friends for ten years as of this summer, and extremely close for the past five. When we lost our townhouse due to my ex causing a ton of shit and eventually withholding rent, my Mom took the both of us in until we were able to get back on our feet. That's where the situation I'm asking for advice on today really begins.

Before we lost our townhouse in mid 2019, Rodney was in a pretty experimental phase of his drug use. He was doing a lot of hallucinogens and Xanax, and because it was in front of me so much I would indulge too, although not as frequently as him. I was personally doing a lot of coke at the time which he wasn't really engaging in with me, saying the hangovers were too much for him at the time and he found the days after too depressing. The xans got pretty out of hand for him, he pretty much traded in his average of smoking a half ounce of shatter every pay period to maybe one or two grams and just got fucked on benzos all day instead. Told me they helped him feel human, as he suffered from pretty severe anxiety and I did too so I was sensitive to that. Once our supplier's stock started getting inconsistent he eventually drew back out of necessity because he couldn't handle the withdrawals. Shortly after this is where we moved in with my mom.

My Mom and her husband are extremely anti substance. They rarely drink and have both never so much as been in the same room as a joint willingly. It shouldn't surprise anyone that our being welcome pivoted pretty directly on the understanding that we wouldn't be bringing any drugs into the house. Rodney, who hasn't spent a day sober since we were 13 years old, actually acclimated shockingly quickly. He respected my parents rules and kept any shatter he had in his toolbox at work (it's legal here, Canada) but rarely smoked it simply due to the inconvenience of it. Suddenly drug use was something that he only really engaged in in social settings, even with weed. Things were good for us.

Come December of that year though, that all changed. Rodney went to Christmas dinner at his family home and was surprised that his Dad wasn't there. His parents had recently split up and moved into separate apartments, but we're still close friends living in the same building and saw each other frequently, so it didn't make sense for him to not be there. Rodney's twin brother arrived late to the dinner and was a bit upset, informing everybody that their Dad had called him that day with some news. Turns out their Dad is gay, but being an older dude stayed in the closet due to fear of discrimination for his whole life. He had made the decision to move back to Ontario because he had been in a secret relationship with his boyfriend for an undeclared period of time and couldn't really handle facing the family he raised. The dude literally told one of his 3 kids ""hey, I'm gay, I have a boyfriend and I'm running away with him, if you could let your mom and siblings know for me that'd be great"" and walked out of their lives completely. On fucking Christmas. Nobody in that room handled it particularly well, understandably so, but Rodney took it really hard.

Over night the guy shut me out emotionally. He wouldn't go into details about what was on his mind like he usually did, and I didn't want to push him. I figured he just needed time to process what he was facing.

To this day, my idea of how he felt at that time is entirely based off of assumption and observation. He became severely depressed. He found a new Xanax dealer (my other clean buddy's old connect, who I regrettably introduced him to several years prior) and started buying them by the hundreds. For months this dude just popped bar after bar until they barely did shit to him anymore. He ended up getting very close to an older man who runs a popular sandwich shop and deli in our town as one of our mutual friends would go there to smoke weed with him in the back room sometimes. They liked his stories, he lead a very interesting life (there is a Sundance festival award winning documentary about this particular deli owner, I'm not even shitting you). Well, after a bit Rodney had been going there long enough for this deli owner to open up to him about the fact that he frequently smoked crystal meth. Rodney, being no stranger to trying new substances and in a particularly vulnerable state, asked if he could try it. Deli guy wouldn't let him for a long while, but eventually cracked after a few weeks of pestering.

He smoked meth every other day for 2 weeks after that, didn't sleep for most of it and still went to work every single day thru it all. He got reckless about drugs in my parents place, he'd be so fucked up on xans he'd pass out in random spots in the house and would be so wired other times he'd start cleaning the kitchen at 2am and wake everyone up. My parents aren't idiots, they knew something was up, and it all came to a head when he started getting so fucked up on the xans that he'd start sparking joints right there in his bedroom without being lucid enough to remember he wasn't allowed. My parents were aware of the situation with his dad and were trying to be sensitive to it, but they gave him the ultimatum that if this shit didn't stop immediately he wasn't gonna be allowed to live there anymore. They didn't know what he was on, they just wanted it to stop and gave him another chance.

I ended up coming clean to all of our other friends that Rodney was going off the rails during a mushroom trip I was on when he wasn't there. My entire life had become mitigating the tension between him and my parents and the stress of it all was too much for me. He wasn't himself, he wasn't opening up to me anymore and I was losing my best friend, I needed help getting through to him. He refused to talk about the substance use with anyone, and kept telling people we were all freaking out over nothing and turning him into some kind of spectacle that we could judge for entertainment. It was never like that, but that didn't stop him from permanently cutting several of our close friends out of his life because they weren't ""supporting"" him. He just convinced himself that nobody actually cared and they just wanted something to gossip about.

He got kicked out of my parents last April, and moved into a shitty motel in our town on a weekly rate for a bit. He was super fucked on xans one day and came clean to me that he started having sex with the deli guy during their meth sessions, I don't know if he even remembers telling me. Said he's not gay but he ""likes to get off"" or some shit. It seemed to me like he was really questioning his identity after everything with his dad, and was going off the rails trying to get his head in order and was doing a dangerously poor job at it. I started to withdraw from him after he got kicked out of my mom's. He wouldn't listen to me anymore and it hurt me too much to force it.

By this point the pandemic was in full swing. I'd see him outside my house from time to time and he told me he was cleaning up, not doing the xans anymore. He had a fair number of other drug stories, however, mostly cocaine binges despite the fact that he used to hate blow but was suddenly all for it. He would talk about hanging out with other people who I'd never met, doing drugs with them. He'd always keep it vague though, and even when I'd call him out on it he'd never go into detail about what he was doing with them.

Aside from the mysterious-ness, he seemed like he was pretty much back to his old self for awhile. When we hung out it finally felt normal. Sure he had his drug stories, but they were much more in tune with the ""occasional fun"" type stories they used to be for us than the constant it became for him at one point. I thought he was getting better. I was wrong.

Our plug started selling hydros. I don't fuck with opiates anymore, my girlfriend's dad is an addict who abandoned them when she was 11 and I won't touch them out of respect for her. But Rodney picked a few up and took them to a test site. They were clean, no fent at all. He flaunted that receipt like he'd just found the damn arc of the covenant or some shit. Suddenly, he was doing hydros almost daily. He justified it in his head that, because they were clean, they were safe. Kept trying to do them with me but I refused. At first, he was fine not bringing them around me. But as time went on and the pandemic restrictions relaxed to allow in home gatherings again, he started disappearing to the bathroom for a while when he'd come over and come out nodding like a motherfucker. I didn't say much. Felt like the words would be wasted on him. I thought that, maybe, if I was just there for him emotionally while he worked through everything it would all be okay.

Then the safe supply came. During the pandemic, our government began prescribing opiates for recreational use to addicts because our street opiate supply was so overridden with fent. He also has to take methadone with it to get the hydros, but he still gets 6 4mg hydros a day from the pharmacy. That was a problem, because he wasn't doing anywhere near that many hydros before due to cost, but with the safesupply all he had to pay was a dispensing fee (around the cost of a single pill from the plug). His tolerance shot through the roof.

Within less than a month of him getting the safe supply, him and I had planned a coke night with another buddy of ours (this was last weekend). We picked up the coke, and he asked me to give him a ride to this random address in town. I pulled up outside and it was junkies as far as the eye could see, a couple cops posted up, and what looked to be some kind of social service building. He ran inside for a minute and came back out with a paper bag. I asked him what it was and he confessed to me that his tolerance has gotten too high to do the hydros nasally, so he's been going to the safe injection sites to get supplies he can IV with. He also confessed to me that he had bought some heroin from one of the junkies outside, just ""for the comedown"" in case he ran out of hydros by the time the blow was gone. He told me that he is ""just having \[his\] fun"" and that I have nothing to worry about, that he's not some lazy junkie, he still has his shit together etc. Then he admitted he's been banging it for a few weeks now, and last time he was at my place the reason he was nodding out so harsh is because he was still nailing down the right IV dose.

I pretended in the moment that I believed him. That it was no big deal. We went through that coke night with him sticking a needle in his arm every time he wanted to dose, coke, hydros and heroin direct into his veins. I hated every second of it, but I didn't want him to feel judged so I kept my mouth shut, told myself that if things got bad I'd freak out then. And yet every single day since that coke night I can barely sleep. I keep thinking about this dark ass road he's decided to walk down and genuinely think he's lost his fucking mind. This dude is like my brother and I feel like he has a disease and I'm watching him die. He's so convincing when he talks like it's all no big deal but IT IS A BIG DEAL, right? Is there any such thing as a functional, recreational IV heroin user?  Am I insane for even considering the fact that that could exist?

I don't wanna lose my brother, but I don't know what I can do to help him. I feel like if I push back on him about this he will cut me out. I don't want him to feel alone, I want him to feel supported, but it's so beyond time for him to get clean. He's suffering. He's killing himself day by day and I don't know how to help him. Do I give him an ultimatum? Do I tell him that he's gotta choose between me or the drugs? Do I tell his Mom? I swear to god if I do nothing and something does happen to him I will never forgive myself. I just don't know what to do.  I know that he's dealing with severe mental health struggles but I feel like he's just running away. He won't talk to me or open up to me about any of it anymore. Ever since his Dad, he hasn't been the same. I just want my brother back. Any advice that you guys can give I would really appreciate. I just feel so lost.

TL;DR - My best friend's drug addiction has gotten to the point where he's using IV heroin. I feel like I'm watching him kill himself and I don't know what to do to get him to stop.",27

Ive tried to quit before but the withdrawls are too extreem for me to handle on my own. My last attempt on quitting was a couple weeks ago and i ended up in the er and then transported to medical detox who kept my withdrawls to a minimum but then said i was good to go after 3 days. I figured i had made it through the rut and had an opporitunity to finally do this but after about a day and a half out of detox i started going through heavy withdrawls and ended up taking xanax. I feel like such a failure and so because of this event in my life i have decided to get into an inpatient rehab/ detox  and the goal is to do 90 days because i want this to be in my past and not half ass it well ive been trying for days from the moment i wake up till i cant call rehabs anymore and the problem is is that i have medical so my options for rehabs are basicly trash, i talked with a friend who has been through the steps and they advized me to get private insurance for a better rehab but that could end up taking months for the insurance to start covering me and not to mention i may be put on a waiting list once i am covered so im just asking for advice to just bite the bullet and go to one of these rehabs covered by medical that are most likley going to not give a shit about me or should i do the insurance route?

Since then I’ve gone to detox, inpatient and completed IOP/PHP programs too many times to count. I haven’t taken any amphetamines in a while mainly because they’re hard to find. I never was exposed to crystal growing up & used to joke w my friends “can you imagine if I did crystal meth?? Thank God I don’t do crystal meth.” Because I already knew that it would be psycho. 

      In December 2018 I tried crystal for the first time. Since then I have had various lengths of sobriety & went to rehab twice. The longest amount of time I had was 9 months until I relapsed this past October. Since trying it in 2018 I have had 5 periods of binges, which in total don’t even add up to a year. 

     I have had two teeth pulled in the last two years. Have a third that will have to be pulled next week. I’m a type two diabetic and it has contributed to my awful neuropathy. I have gone to the ER twice this year, within 3 days, for severe dehydration. I have trigger finger in both my hands majority of the time. My skin is picked to shreds. I go into psychosis often. I’m scared of my own shadow. I accidentally hurt myself regularly. I spend more money on pedialyte & icy hot & other treatments for my drug-induced ailments than I do on actual ice!!!! I am a hot fucking mess to say the least....

       I have never felt this hopeless about getting sober again. I usually am quite confident, I know exactly what to do to create lasting sobriety. This time is different- It’s darker. It’s so much bigger than me and I honestly feel like I don’t stand a chance. It’s like a black mass that follows me everywhere and I can’t escape it. I know that my addiction does want me dead. That’s it’s job, to fucking kill me, right? 

     I don’t know who I have become. Who that monster is in the mirror. The shell of a girl who used to be everyone’s most positive & happy-go-lucky friend. 

     Meth- The devil I know. It’s just plain evil. Cunning baffling & powerful. I am paying an extremely high price to destroy everything around me. My body hates me, my soul is gone & my spirit broken. But, I found my holy grail after all these years. Now that I’ve tasted this, how could I ever give this up???? How??? It’s honestly such a mind fuck because I end up feeling 100x worse than the initial negative emotions I use to escape from. There is no better living through chemistry. It’s all a fucking lie. The human body is NOT meant to feel this good ever. It’s just not. It’s not authentic, it’s superficial as fuck. 

     I want sobriety. I want peace of mind. I want my 3yr old son to grow up with his mother and be proud of her one day. I don’t wanna break my parents hearts anymore or make my mother cry. I want to make myself proud. It’s really simple- give up everything for one thing OR give up one thing for everything. Why is this even up for debate? Well, because I have so many reservations. I’ve never stayed sober longer than 9 months over the course of 13 years. History has shown that it never seems to stick long-term which I believe leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy of my relapses. FEAR- Failure expected and received. Fear runs my life. It is my jailer. Everyday I am sentenced to my very own hell. Sobriety is like a carrot dangling in front of my face but I can’t quite reach it. It seems like the most unattainable of goals.

     I was supposed to end my binge this past weekend but I am terrified of coming down. I slept last night (thankfully) & had one small line to get me through work today. Then I’m gonna buy some more weed to combat the inevitable comedown. Tomorrow I am getting the vivitrol shot. In 2019 I got the shot for 4 months to kill my cravings & when I didn’t get my 5th shot I relapsed. I can’t help but believe there is a correlation here!! I take Wellbutrin as well and as many of you probably know there are new studies suggesting the vivitrol/Wellbutrin duo for methamphetamine addicts. 

      I want to start working out for the endorphins and so that I don’t gain all my weight back. I have a top-notch therapist. I have decided to try SMART Recovery because I like the CBT approach. I also want to try Life Ring which is a secular sobriety program. AA will always be my home & I strongly believe in its principles & the effectiveness of step work but I feel like it’s time to try something different. I don’t hangout w tweakers so I honestly don’t have a lot of people to cut out of my life which is a plus. My boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic and is so supportive. My child’s dad as well as my parents are also very supportive and I am very fortunate. I know what needs to happen. 

      My problem isn’t lack of knowledge but lack of application of that knowledge. The only thing in my way is ME. If a better life if what you want, you first have to take off the noose. People don’t change til it hurts bad enough. Although I don’t quite yet want to be sober more than I want to use, it fucking hurts y’all. I’m ready to get out of my own way. I want to be the comeback kid. Every hero has adversity in their past otherwise they wouldn’t be a good hero. & lastly, as Bukowski once said- “if you’re worried about losing your soul you still have soul left to lose”

I appreciate any & all feedback & encouragement. I know that I am not as alone as I feel. I don’t have to do this alone. Connection is everything even if it’s with strangers from Reddit. Hugs from the buckeye state and thanks for reading all of this.",16

What kind of help is available to him?**

I'm from the UK and I have a good friend from California who has been having a really hard time lately. One of the big things he's struggling with is addiction to weed, cigarettes, and benadryl.

For reference he's in his 30s, disabled, lives alone, but has good health insurance and financial support from his parents.

(I know there's some controversy about whether weed is addictive so to clarify, what I mean is: He doesn't want to smoke it anymore, he says it makes him feel bad, he's tried quitting repeatedly and throwing it in the trash, but can't help coming back to it.)

Lately I'm getting more concerned so I offered to come up with a support plan for him. He agreed to give it a try.

I've come up with some ideas for ways to help him with some of the stuff he's struggling with. However a big blind spot in the plan is that I don't know much about the kind of support available to him for addiction recovery.

I've been trying to look into it on Google but I'm finding it a bit difficult to navigate and understand. Where I'm from, the standard approach for seeking help would be to talk to a GP who could then refer you to whatever services they think would be appropriate (e.g. support groups, local outpatient support services, inpatient rehab in severe cases). Does it work the same in the US or does it work differently? What does the pathway look like? What options are available, for whom would they be appropriate, and how effective are they? That's the kind of info I'm looking for, but anything would be appreciated.

Does anyone know what kind of support resources would be available for him, especially in California? Anything I should avoid?",1

He also said he likes being sober and how much clarity his mind has etc etc. But over these past few months he has relapsed twice that I am aware of. I realized he has a problem in December and January when we smoked together and both the times it felt like he hadn’t had enough. I had a conversation with him and asked him that I don’t like that he doesn’t have self restraint and maybe he should only smoke in my presence so that I can monitor once a month. He also always agreed that once a month is enough for him, so we agreed to this then. But I was wrong, I wasn’t aware of the gravity of the situation and I had no experience with how to deal with someone with an addiction. He smoked everyday for a month or so until I figured it out in mid Feb, he kept lying to me all that time about work so that he doesn’t have to stay with me or meet me and he can stay home and smoke. After I figured out what was happening we had a huge fight, and me again not knowing how to deal with things got super angry for being lied to and that weed was a priority over me. We almost broke up and he asked me space for 10 days which I know was to smoke weed as much as he can before he actually had to start working. He visited me after a week stoned but only because he has finished all the weed he had. He promised he will attend NA meetings and will try to stay sober. He didn’t smoke for some three weeks and things were normal between us, I was happy again until I went on a vacation with my friends. He started then again and after I came back, we had a huge fight again not for weed but about two times we fought when I was on a vacation. I asked for a break and he immediately asked for breakup. That fight continued for 3-4 days for no reason. It felt like I was being misunderstood a lot, for example me asking a picture to see him was taken as if I am trying to see if he is high, which he probably was but I just wanted to see him coz we hadn’t met and seen each other in a week or something. He has been smoking every day for past 2-3 weeks again and doesn’t want to talk to me or see me. We went for a short trip last weekend where we decided he can smoke again on may 5th and why I have problem with this. And I explained him that I have the problem with addiction. Sometimes he accepts that the amount of weed he consumes is not okay and other times he tells me that I should accept him as it is and I don’t understand him thats why I get mad. He also says that weed has a place in his life and he needs to find it but I should be okay with it but I don’t see it like that. I tell him that every time he thinks he will smoke one joint, it doesn’t stop there and it becomes an everyday thing to the point he needs it when he wakes up and to be able to sleep. 
It feels like every time he smokes he just detaches me and leaves me so that he can smoke in peace without feeling responsible of the damage that will cause this relationship. He also tells me that i need a lot of his time which i don’t think is true as we meet like 2 days in a week and I expect him to text me everyday not through out the day but quick texts here and there, good morning good night just to feel connected whenever we are not meeting. I feel he doesn’t want texting and calling because he doesn’t want me to interfere in his smoking fun, coz whenever he is not smoking we do all that and its not a problem. He also alters the reality in his mind, lies, manipulates and does fault finding to justify and rationalize all his actions and think how we are not good together every time he is on weed. Yesterday I called him after not talking for two days and I was mad and I could tell he was high and I told him you are hurting me as he didn’t talk to me for the past two days despite saying he would and all he said that I don’t want to hurt you and said I am gonna go because I want to sleep and feel happy.
Right now I am lost and feeling broken because I don’t know what to do and should I even be in this relationship. I don’t understand addiction but I can see how this is the only thing hurting something which could be beautiful between us. It’s just so hard coz a part of me loves him and cares for him.",2

2021-04-08 20:29:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mn5inv/im_really_going_for_it/,"""I'm really going for it.""","I told this to one of my sober buddies when I was 9 months sober or so.  It was at this hot tub party we were having at our friend's house.  I distinctly remember this moment.

""I'm really going for it,"" I said.  And he asked me, skeptically: ""Going for what?""

You know, back then, and even still today to some degree, I was really hard on myself.  I remember thinking that ""yeah maybe I'm just being kind of a cocky douche"".  I didn't try to explain what I meant.  You could have said sobriety.  But it wasn't just that.  It was more than sobriety.

I didn't try to explain it to him, because I didn't feel like I could, and perhaps I felt like maybe I was just dreaming.  But that feeling never left me.  It's been almost 7 years since that day, and it hasn't left.  It's still here.  And it's stronger than ever.  And you know what?  Now I know how to explain it.

I'm really going for it.  Going for what, you say?  For a wonderful live that is dignified, meaningful, and full of love and joy.  Will I get everything I ever wanted?  No.  Does it matter?  Also no.  But the important thing is that I'm going to try.  Because I want these things, and I feel that I deserve them.  There is nobody in the world that can tell me otherwise.

There have been obstacles.  There will continue to be obstacles.   Addiction for me was not about willpower.  I had to surrender.   But surrender wasn't about retreating into misery and self-flagellation.  No.  Surrender was about accepting the truth about who I am, despite my faulty upbringing: the truth that I am a beautiful human being who is absolutely worthy of love, joy, and all the beautiful things that this life has to offer.  That is what I surrendered to.

I surrendered to that truth, and now every day I choose to fight for it.  Patiently, lovingly, compassionately, yes.  But I fight for it.  I fight for me.  I fight for my fellow addicts, my friends, my family, and for all of my brothers and sisters here on this planet with me.  Because I know that life, despite all the bullshit, *is* worth it.

I'm really going for it, and you know what, as far as I'm concerned, I've already made it.  I've stayed sober.  My buddy didn't.  Not everyone does.  But my life has become a real joy, and a real adventure.

But the only full stop in life is death.  Until that moment comes, I'm going to keep fighting for all that is good in the world.  We only live once.  Might as well do something amazing with it.",4

I dropped out of high school a 4.0 student (could have graduated 6 months early) and started hitch hiking across the country. I started using heroin when I was 18.. continued to travel. A lot of my friends I grew up with also started using. All my new friends started using. I was in a web of addiction for 15 years. The traveling community i was in, was my family. In 2006 a friend of mine was hopping trains and ended up getting sucked under the car. He was the first close friend that died. He was clean at the time and it was a rookie mistake that took his life.. there is a book written about his life if you guys wanna check it out.. it’s called Railroad Man. Since then, I have lost 30 friends, my father, uncle, all my grandparents. My family consists of my mother, sister and brother.. none of us who are very close. I found my boyfriend dead three years ago and have been clean since. I can’t do funerals anymore. I’ve been to two since he died, but those were the last of the crew. I’ve missed a few as well. This list keeps growing. When I got clean, it was like I was picking up from where I left off at 17. Learning to be an adult in my mid 30s was difficult. I didn’t even realize I had ptsd until I started seeing a therapist.. BUT.. I’m doing it. I’m in the happiest relationship I’ve ever been in, bought my first house, have a cool dog who’s kind of a jerk. I’m .. happy. But, I’m not done growing. I always thought I was “desensitized to death” .. That was not true. I was high. All that loss came back once I got clean and it still hurts. I’m 37 now.. and thinking about how much life I (potentially) have left blows my mind. I’ve been trying to write a book about the loss and experiences I’ve had, but it comes out very jumbled.. I still have some time tho.",66

Hi! 

I am checking the potential interrest for people to participate in a study about people who, on their own outside of any experimental studies, have managed to quit a substance addiction, whether it´s smoking, drinking or any other drugs, and no matter the psychedelic substance of choice. 

If this describes you, and you would like to be interviewed about your experience for a study on the subject, of course anonymously, then please write to [joaheg-8@student.ltu.se](mailto:joaheg-8@student.ltu.se) and just write what your addiction was and what substance you used to succesfully quit said addiction and I will get back to you with more information. 

The interviews would be conducted via Zoom in either english or swedish. 

Thank you and I hope I get to hear from you!

I get addiction ive been addicted to alcohol before. I am now over 600 days sober but I have a situation with my friend that I just can’t understand and I really want to understand. So this friend is kind of addicted to pills. Says they are not addicted but to me seems like they are. So the person does these pills a lot of days out of the week. Even when they try to take a break they end up getting more again within a day to two. Also on the break days they are taking subozone. When they are not doing the pill they are sleepy, lazy, and in less of a good mood, smoking weed helps the mood lighten up. On the days with the pills they are wanting to do things, very talkative, nods out. It’s like they get all this motivation from the pill but once they are off it’s a different story and they don’t follow through with anything. I’m at the point where I’m like ok well this person must be miserable in their life and I’m part of it so are they not happy with me too? I know I’m not the whole reason but I feel like I’m part of it and it’s a terrible feeling. I’ve been wanting to vent about this for a while now but I feel horrible even doing so but after last night I had to. It was his daughters birthday and of course he needs to leave to get pills the kids wanted the cake but everyone had to wait, like you couldn’t wait a couple hours until after the cake or just wait until tomorrow. I’m trying not to put too much info Bc i don’t want him to see this, but I’m really could use some input from anyone who has maybe dealt with something like this before. Thank you",5

Drank, drugged and smoked since I 12 years old. I’ve been addicted to heroin. I’ve woke up with DTs from booze. I’ve suffered through hundreds of speed comedowns. In the end, luckily, I was able to stop all of that 6 years ago. 

There’s only one more drug I still crave and that’s nicotine. Smokeless tobacco specifically. I love it. I love the taste, the burn you get when you put in a dip, the buzz in the morning, etc.. I love all of it. Except for what I know it’s doing to my mouth and body. 

I haven’t lost any teeth or anything like that.. yet. I want to stop before it gets to that point. That’s why I’m posting this.

Anybody here successfully quit smoking/chewing? I want to know how you did it. Did you go cold turkey? Did you use gum, patches or pills? How long before you didn’t want to kill everything around you when you didn’t have nicotine? Do you feel better now that you quit? What was your plan and how did you execute it?

Any advice is welcome. My habit is big. About a full can of Kodiak Wintergreen a day. If not more. Let’s just say I ALWAYS have a dip in my mouth unless I’m eating. I’ve even slept with one in before. Every single part of my life has dip tobacco involved in it. I need to find a way to break that cycle.

I know I can’t go cold turkey. My temper is hot when I’m in nicotine withdrawals. I was planning on picking up a box of Nicorette tomorrow and following the program to taper myself down enough until I can stop altogether.

However we have all kinds of cravings and urges to deal with but that doesn’t change we still shouldn’t relapse.

If things were going well we wouldn’t relapse so that’s what we should do even if things were difficult. That would be the strong course of action. It doesn’t mean you should try to quit in one go but instead fight hard to make your partial progress. The more you normalize fighting through it the more you’ll continue to fight through it later and the more you break the addiction the weaker the addiction gets.

So the strong course of action means you do what you know you should do and having the strength to follow through on that decision.",1

Everyone is different so I believe there’s different treatment options for everyone, especially those with more pressing mental health illnesses than some. So I’m just looking to hear people talk about other methods that worked for them outside of just the 12 step groups. Not hear to argue or debate that 12 step is the best or get told “you’re just not completely surrendering” And I’m not saying I’ll abandon It, just need some guidance to get excited about living better.

There is a ton of co-dependency going on in that house. When she started talking about it and making excuses for him (aaaagain) I almost lost it on her. I remained calm on the phone but ended the conversation as quickly as I could.  I need to talk to someone about the best way to make her aware of how she’s enabling him and basically allowing her son to live just above rock bottom. I know if I go in to the conversation without prepping it for it I will say all the wrong things and it won’t help the situation. Thanks,3

I had to spray it every couple of hours  or I simply couldn’t breathe. I had to go cold turkey because I moved to another country and they didn’t have any for sale. It was absolute hell, I couldn’t breathe properly for a good month. It was also a really warm country so I feel the climate there really helped with it as well and about after a month I could breathe through my nose again. On top of that I have a deviated septum so the airflow through my nose is already limited as well, this was actually the reason I started using the spray in the first place. Now I moved back to my old country and the weather here is -10°C with crazy wind. I got sick immediately after my return but kept myself from using the nose spray again and just suffered and waited it out. A few days ago however I caught cold again and just couldn’t resist it. The next night, “surprisingly”, I got a stuffed nose the exact same time. Used it again. It was all good during the day, just that exact time at night. Now its the third day and by 5pm I was unable to breathe through my nose again. I usually used it around 11pm but now at 5 its already completely stuffed. I thought I could just use it for a couple of days before I got addicted again and quit right before I get addicted again but I guess the 10 day rule goes for only people who haven’t been addicted to it before. I’m freaking out tbh because its already pretty late and it hasn’t gotten any better, I really don’t want to get addicted to it again but I also absolutely hate this feeling. Is it ok if I just spray one side until the other is fine or should I just stop and go cold turkey again? Thanks! I appreciate any advice",3

Her son is a disrespectful, narcissist. It makes me not want to bother letting my son see him anymore because why do I keep trying when he shows no effort.

Dealing with a delicate issue like that of addiction is not easy, because it has many facets and elements to take into consideration. In this guide we will try to define the concept of pathological addiction, examining the most common ones and the characteristics of these behavioral alterations.

Breaking the rules, especially at a young age, can be considered natural. However, if certain attitudes become habits, this could lead to a series of discomforts, causing physical and cognitive imbalances.

But what are we talking about specifically and what are the most common types of addictions? Let’s find out together in the next paragraphs of this guide.

I’ve always known I’ve had an addictive personality. Addiction isn’t big in my family but one of my uncles is a recovering alcoholic and brief user, sober now for over 30 years. His uncle, my great uncle, was a functioning alcoholic for roughly 60 years 


Looking at addiction as a whole, my first experience came at 16 with cigarettes. Still smoking, now more than ever, I know it’s killing me slowly but I also can’t help but love them in a way. In the past I’ve never personally had a problem with drugs, marijuana or alcohol.

I’ve had generic instant release adderall rx for a few years now and would take one now and then, however over the past few months, I’ve started taking 10mg-30mg/day regularly and pretty much daily. 

My prescribed dose is higher than what I am taking daily but I still have a full dependence on them in order to function in my daily life. When I take them I get hyped. I feel like I can do anything, usually with work, and I’m able to hone in on those skill sets and accomplish the goals for the day. It’s fun and exciting. 

But other times I fixate on other things like sex or I decide to smoke weed or start drinking beer at 12 in the afternoon.

This has been happening more lately and I find myself in a position where I can’t control these spirals. When I smoke or drink I’m still able to perform my daily tasks and responsibilities. I never get so fucked up that I make a fool out of myself but there are still times where I wake up the next day and reflect. 

I’m worried that I’m living a temporarily sustainable lifestyle right now. In fact, I know that I am. If I were to continue, this lifestyle will kill me in 30-40 years. But there is a side of me that justifies it and says “just use this time in your life to have fun and get ahead in your career now.” A part of me feels like I’m running out of youth and it’s now or never to get this part of me out if my system. But having been in this cycle since July, I’m increasingly growing speculative of this current lifestyle I’m living. 

I know this is an addiction subreddit and a part of me is ready to accept that I’m an addict but I don’t think I want to live a lifestyle without being able to casually and socially drink. I think my addiction lies in the generic adderall and I’m not sure how to address that and only that. 

Thanks",30

So I take a pill every few days of a specific ADHD drug (a type of *methylphenidate*). My psychiatrist advised me not to take it daily- only when necessary because it can increase my anxiety and may cause heart issues. I had heart inflammation before and the doctor ran some tests on me and ensured I was okay (no heart issues). 

Now... whenever I take it, I am obviously alerted, concentrated (""procrastinating"" now though bc of my anxiety) and whatever these pills do. The shitty thing about it, it causes a lack of appetite and kind of triggering my childhood ED (I wont get into details bc I don't wanna trigger anyone). I did something insane 2/3 days ago? I didn't sleep for SIXTY HOURS. Why? no reason. I just didn't wanna sleep. So how did I keep myself up? i took more than a pill (each \~9-10 hours). I never felt so indestructible, accomplished, ""manic"", energetic- ever. I felt on top of the fucking world. Then I fell asleep for 22 hours lol. Felt disgusted, insignificant- basically the opposite effect. I have such an active mind and I hate not doing anything. You can say I'm *addicted to being busy (my reality-escape mechanism)*. 

I did go some days without it but I felt a bit crazy. I felt **fatigued** and just- my normal boring fuzzy-minded self, who would get distracted by anything. I am a driven/passionate person, and I feel enhanced with the meds. I feel like I cant fucking live without these pills because it keeps me active. I get so much done. But I am noticing that I'm a bit dependent on it? Is this normal or am I an addict? Is it even possible to be so-? I cant get off it and if I were to- how the fuck am I gonna do anything in life to concentrate etc.- anything a person with ADHD who struggles with uni/life would want.",5

So it all happened about ten rears ago when I caught my brother smoking a pipe in the bathroom. I was experiencing with different drugs at the time and he told me it was just smokable gas. So I tried it and omg what a feeling that was! Fast forward a couple of months I had a mte from school hanging around me and started selling ice.. my stupid brother found out and next minute me my brotherand my best mates where in the shit.. it happened so quickly I'll never forget it. Vicious cycles of getting on with mates is was horrible. Fast forward abit and I ditched my best mates to get clean although my brother was still lingering around me which will cause me to trigger.

So fast forward to the last few years of my addiction my mental state was horrible I would relapse once every month and it was fucking with my head that bad I out myself into hospital to get better . Now that I have finally quit it for good (4 months ) it's no longer in my circle but then a transitioned to coke and gambling wich I feel better not touching the ice but my money and behaviours are worse now. I'm pretty much at rock bottom with no money, feel like you're shit and my depression is at a all the high. 

I've been off the coke now for 3 weeks and slowly feeling abit better I'm not going back to the shit anymore I'm 27 with my life ahead of me . Ii be for a great career and a good support network and I've got the drive to be successful. My question is how do you get rid of the lack of motivation that meth has tore out of me I'm mentally slow rn and I know it's just the drugs wearing off .

The last time i posted here was my story of how i became addicted social media as kpop stan and asked for your help and i'm glad to tell you all that i'm now moving on and getting my life together even the progress is slow. Now, i'm practicing meditation, doing new hobbies like gardening and reading books. But i just want to share this new thing i'm facing right now.

i just go straight to the point, whenever i think of my bias there's this feeling of fear and a little trauma that i feel. It's like whenever he pops up in my mind i remember those dark times i was in my addicted state and it makes me feel scared that i might go back on using twitter again or reactivate my account and get drowned with it again. But whenever i see or think of the other members it doesnt make me feel that way. This made me kinda feel scared that i'm dissociating fear on my bias like he didn't do anything wrong and i think it’s just my mind. And what i learned in meditation is to just let go and don't bother what my mind say but i just ask myself why am i like this? i deleted his photos in my gallery just to moved on. i still haven’t even listened to his newly dropped album bcs it hurts me thinking of other fans are enjoying and celebrating his new achievement while me being dramatic and worrying over my unstable mind 😞

I had every intention of staying sober, but it didn’t last long. My pill addiction has gotten so much worse and once again here I am feeling ashamed and frustrated. What’s so frustrating right now is pretending I’m not addicted to anything. My brother died a few weeks ago and he died probably still in the mist of his addiction. I don’t want to die. I have to stop this, but how? I’m in a state where addiction treatment isn’t popular and honestly idk if I would go to a treatment program because I don’t want people to know. I have a lot to lose if people knew. And honestly, as dumb as I know it is, I can’t deal with the additional shame once people knew. If I could get though the first month or two without hydrocodone, adderall, alcohol, and ambien I believe I’d be good. I know it would be a constant battle for the rest of my life but I just need a start. Y’all have any more advice? How’d did y’all make it though this process?

I got off MDMA like a year ago but now I got addicted to methylphenidate (Ritalin) and caffeine. It is a very stupid story but, I am prescribed ritalin 20mg a day for my depressive episodes and ofc I abused it, I used to crush it up and snort like 80mg a day, but now I stopped doing this for like 3 months and I was taking it as I should but still to this day I get these cravings.. So I decided to drink coffee instead of ritalin to get rid of these cravings and now I drink like 15 cups a day and I am pretty sure it’s much worse than ritalin. Recently I discovered that caffeine triggers my anxiety and panic attacks and so I tried to quit coffee but I get even more anxious when I don’t drink it.. It’s a loop.. I am just very tired and unfortunately I won’t be able to see my psychiatrist for a long time so I decided to post it here. Anyone who had problems with coffee/methylphenidate has any advices?

So a friend of mine has an addiction problem with amphetamines and GHB/GBL. They are currently in an urgent psychiatric care and are coming out soon, so we need to find a good rehab ASAP, one that will take them in imediately. Money is not a problem, her family will pay any amount, however we’d prefer it to not be in hundreds of thousands of euros.

We are looking for a good, reliable and reputable rehab, preferably one that specializes or has experience with GHB/GBL. Also it has to accept patients immediately, since my friend themselves don’t want to spend too much time in the same environment when they come out of psychiatric care.

We are from EU and would prefer the rehab be located here, especially central Europe or the Balkans.",10

Can anyone help?,"Ok so I realise this is very different to the normal posts- I have never touched a drug in my life (I’m 20) but have known people who have who’ve fucked their life up and mine as a result. I’ve ended up with a phobia of mild altering substances which causes me constant anxiety and depression. They scare me so much because I can see the damage they do and the thought of an altered mind state truly scares me.

I don’t want to vilify those who have used, but I am scared of those who do because I fear contamination and I fear what drugs can do. I’ve started working in the arts and I know that use in this industry can be prevalent. I don’t really know what I’m asking, but if anyone has any words of understanding or help I would really welcome it - be it reinforcing the reasons for my fear, or trying to help me understand other perspectives. 

I’m a student so understanding experiences might help, and how to help try and keep my friends safe and ideally away from drugs. I don’t want them screwing their lives or mine. I’m so tired of living in constant fear - of even seeing a picture of just weed and having a panic attack. Am I right to be scared and what can I do to support those around me?

I wish you all the very best in your recovery, and I hope you all find the peace and happiness that can be there in life without any drugs.",2

2021-04-05 00:36:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mkcpoo/dealing_with_moms_addiction_input_wanted/,Dealing with mom’s addiction - input wanted,"TL;DR - my mom struggles with mental health issues and substance abuse, and I want to know how much can be attributed to her disease and how much of it can be attributed to emotional abuse.

Hello everyone. My (23F) mom (59F) has been an alcoholic ever since I can remember. My childhood was fine, but clouded by days where things were just bad. I remember one day in fourth grade when I came home to my mom passed out in her bed and had to deal with the situation (even though I didn’t really understand the entire circumstances and was super freaked out).

Anyway, her substance abuse also triggered me to develop an eating disorder where I exhibited extreme symptoms for over a year, and had to seek multiple sources of medical intervention during high school. Through therapy, I learned that my inability to control her drinking led me to develop anorexia. I asked my mom multiple times to stop drinking and she didn’t.

Fast forward to November 2019: I had been living in West Africa for 5 months with limited contact due to spotty cell service. I get a message from her saying that she lost her job because of her drinking and was going into rehab for a month. I was happy she was getting help, but at the same time, I was angry that she waited to get help until it drastically affected her own life.

Background: I was evacuated back to the US in March 2020 due to covid, and was communicating with her about my flight updates and estimated arrival. She was living at her house with her husband, my dad, at the time, after moving back into the house spontaneously one day when she decided she didn’t want to live with roommates at her sober house anymore. So, right before I board my flight, in an emotional state, I call her to tell her that I’m on my way back and the flight details. In this call, she tells me that she is leaving to go to stay at her friend’s house on the east coast (over 20 hours driving from the house) and will not be home when I arrive. She said she made this decision because she was worried about staying sober with changed living situation dynamics. (There were other living options she rejected that were in the same general geographic area as the house.)

Fast forward: I am going to outline events that have occurred in the past two months.
1. Her mom’s (my grandma’s) birthday. She felt bad that she couldn’t see her mom in person for her birthday this year (her mom lives a couple of hours from the house) and requested that we do something for her. My brother and I had already planned to spend the day with grandma, but my mom micromanaged and requested specific things that we do. My mom told grandma about certain things she wanted us to do over the phone, which made grandma expect certain things. Not wanting to disappoint grandma, but not wanting to cave into the distant requests of my mom, my brother and I oblige. I spend over a day getting things ready and planning. I get her a cake. I order her favorite food from a restaurant. I get a bottle of champagne. I make a special fruit salad. I get her a card. I buy and wrap her a gift. I fill up the car with gas. I make sure my brother knows the plan and do all the dishes for my grandma during our visit to her house (she had a stroke and has limited mobility). My brother prints off a spa gift certificate my mom had sent him to give grandma, and he adds a few clip art pictures and changes the font to make it look slightly better. The response we got: my brother gets a lovey-dovey email from her thanking him for all the effort he has put into grandma’s birthday. I send my mom a picture of everything we did to make her day special, and she sends back a message “eww, purple frosting??”
2. My partner lives fairly close to my mom and I visit him as much as possible around our work schedules and covid. My mom’s relatives, with whom I’m very close, also live in the same general area. My relatives invited me, my partner, my mom, and her friend over for dinner one day when I will be in town soon. My mom initially accepts, then states that a different friend is coming to visit her the same day. The friend cannot see my relatives for COVID reasons. My mom requests that I do not see my relatives, but rather only see her and her two friends for dinner. (Add’l info: my mom has recently spent a week with the visiting friend at a resort. The last time I have seen my mom was in October.) I state that I plan on dinner with the relatives as planned and will see my mom a different day. After further reflection, however, I don’t know if my mom deserves to see me.

I know in addition to substance abuse, my mom has anxiety and depression. She has been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist for over 20 years, but she’s also not very self aware, so to me it seems like she has made little progress and has no long-term goals (besides staying sober). She has been gone over a year and still does not have a plan to return to the house or even state. She has no plan for when her friend inevitably dies and she must find an alternative living situation (the friend is 91 years old).

I guess my question to anyone who might have the time, energy, and interest to respond is: am I being cognizant enough of her mental health issues and substance abuse when thinking about the whole situation, or is she gaslighting me and being emotionally abusive? I want to support her, but she makes me so upset in every interaction that we have that I always end up crying on and off for a day after talking to her.

Any and all input is appreciated, and I thank each and every one of you for taking the time to help me understand. So proud of all of you here and sending hugs.",1
2021-04-05 00:21:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mkchoo/i_need_advice_i_feel_so_lost/,I need advice. I feel so lost.,"Hey guys, meth addict here.

I was 75 days clean the other day. I saw my friend who said he got sober, and the day I saw him he relapsed after a month of clean time. He was flipping shit and said “don’t worry, I won’t have anything on me.” He lied. He got out a baggie and said “don’t look down. Obviously I fucking did. He’s in my car and has probably a 50 bag he was trying to divide up. I said “turn on the light. I want to see it.” And as soon as I saw it I thought about how this shit ruined my life, and then secondarily how I missed it.

Anyways, he left and he spilled the TINIEST, MOST MINUSCULE amount on my seat but the ice head in me saw the itty bitty crystals. I thought “oh, hey, maybe it’s salt.” I licked it and obviously it wasn’t. Fast forward 30 minutes and I’ve got a flashlight on my seat in a gas station parking lot praying he left more. There were itty bitty pieces, not even $3 worth but any little thing I found I put on my phone and put it up my nose. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me. I felt it burn and I wanted it. Whatever I put into my body I know wouldn’t even show on a drug test it was that small of an amount.

I haven’t told anyone. I went to residential, PHP, IOP, and now I live in a sober house and this guilt is eating me alive. I went to my best friends place 4 hours away and she was having a party with alcohol. I had intentions of staying sober, but I fucked that up too. I didn’t go crazy, I had a couple drinks. Actually, I ended up telling everybody my story with ice- how I got into it, how it ruined me, how I’m rebuilding- and I just couldn’t drink anymore after that. I’ve come so far and I don’t want to ruin what I’ve built. I don’t want to tell my house manager because I’m scared of the repercussions. I don’t want to tell my best friend who’s also in recovery for heroin (who I have romantic feelings for and vice versa- have not acted on them really besides holding hands because dating in recovery is risky and I understand this) because I know he’d be disappointed in me for putting myself in a high risk situation and for throwing away my sobriety.

I have meetings on the same grounds that my sober house is on and I don’t want to talk about how I’m struggling because word will get back to the house.

I don’t know guys. I need help. Some sort of advice. I’m fucking up and I don’t want to go down this rabbit hole again. I’m going to kill myself if I keep going, intentionally or not. I want to stop this in its tracks while I can. I’ve come so far and was so proud. Progress, not perfection. I know. But this stings. I want to be so much better and I was doing incredible. I just can’t believe I’ve done this to myself.

Was this a relapse as far as the ice is concerned or drug seeking behavior? Should I find a different home group? How do I tell my friend/should I? I need a sponsor- how do I get one? Please, any and all help is so appreciated.",16
2021-04-05 00:03:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mkc7ah/stop_trying_to_quit_your_addiction_surrender_to/,"Stop ""trying"" to quit your addiction, surrender to it and you will be free","I’ve decided to stop using will power to overcome my addiction. I have committed myself to surrendering to life circumstances, surrendering to my higher power, to accept life, and to accept that I am not in control of my addiction. This is a key strategy that takes the place of wishing that we could change things by ourselves, thinking that we have the capability to ""just force myself to stop"" , hating the circumstances we are in, thinking  we can control things in which we cannot, becoming resentful because we have stagnated for another day, yet again. 

While surrendering in 12 step programs implies surrendering to the fact that you don't have control over your addiction, this can (and in my opinion should) be broadened to all of our experiences. For instance... I CANNOT will myself to go the gym, I cannot will myself to get out bed, I can only surrender to the fact that I am deeply flawed and that I alone cannot do any of these things. We all fall short of the glory of God. But now I am practicing working through a higher power that I can use as a shield and a tool to find the true motivational spark to actual DO, instead of lie in sorrow, self hatred, and my addictive behavior. 

Most people who initially come to the program have a problem with god, even if they may not know it. Here I was a ""rational atheist"" who was really only rationalizing his hatred of something that he didn't even believe in. My beliefs of the world, thought to have been formulated by rational thought, was really an emotional response fueled by resentment. HA! 

Those who believe in something greater than themselves, can keep from falling into the hands of satan, (or for my secular friends you can just equate satan with utter despair, self destruction, and your addictive behavior). They can call upon their higher power when they are in need of help. But you cannot even ask for help, if you HAVE NOT SURRENDERED!!!! 

Atheists do not have this capability, people who practice no spiritual exercises do not have this capability. They believe that they are the most intellectual beings in the universe, they believe themselves to be higher and more correct than God. This is a universal factor of the addict. We believe us to have higher authority than God. 

This is why surrender is the first step. Admit that you have no control, admit that what you are doing is not working. Admit that you can do better. Surrender to the addiction, Surrender to Life, Surrender to God, and you are one your way to freedom from addiction. 

&#x200B;

The real question is how does one surrender? Or how do you know if you truly have surrendered? I would say that you have not surrender if you do or think any of the following: 

\- Think that ""I will only drink on Saturday's and it will only be wine"" 

\- I will only watch certain types of porn

\- I had a good day today so I don't need to go to my 12 step group next week 

\- I have the ability to force myself to stop my behavior on my own

\- I will put porn blockers on my computer, expect for this one website that I still like 

(please feel free to comment on what you think surrendering, giving up control, and seeking a higher power actually looks like in the real world or any examples of these tactics that you have implemented in your life.)",0

I’d get ahold of some benzos, get off for a day, then i would feel like a complete asshole and it would stop all together. This happened 3 times over the last 4 years. 

This last one was different. I got ahold of some GBL, made GHB, and convinced myself I could use it responsibly. Classic mistake. I had gotten complacent. I basically had an unlimited supply.

Long story short, my wife caught me. I lied to her face, invalidated her intuition, but it was checkmate. Watching her go through agony about my relapse was terrible. I feel so bad for having put her through it. I should have relied on her, told her I was struggling, and let her in. I’ve gotten into a treatment program, and I’ve made up my mind to be vulnerable with her. 

Here’s my struggle... now that she gets to see this part of me, I’m terrified that she’s going to think less of me, and ultimately leave me. Who wants to deal with that? She deserves the truth, and I need her on my team, but it’s ugly. I don’t want her to see it this side of me. Being honest, really honest, is incredibly hard.",6

I have been struggling since 2018 to stay clean. I was not being an active addict on a daily basis, at my home, or alone - that nightmare was gladly over since early 2017.

But I was still partying and doing coke with friends once or twice a month, and despite my attempts to avoid it, I kept coming back. Last year I even took Saturday morning classes to force myself away from temptation, and it worked pretty well until December, when the course finished. 

I promised myself to start 2021 clean and 44 days ago I failed. It was just a tiny bit, just two lines that upset me more than some nasty weekend long binges from the past. Because I realized I was fed up with those people and just hanging out with the solely purpose of scoring dope. 

I stepped back and stopped seeing them. But I was still talking, following social media and such,    so I was still tempted.  

So today I finally cut ties with this group of
people. I burned the bridge, so I never cross it again. Deleted phone numbers, blocked Fb and Instagram. I will be basically alone and left with less than a handful of friends now. But well, so be it. They were not friends anyway, just coke buddies.

I will stick to my promise to remain clean. I will make new friends, eventually. I will reconnect to my real friends, those that held my hand during hard times and love me no matter what, and will never let me slip again. 

Today is a great day for a fresh start and to be reborn. Burn that bridge, if you need to.

I've been in rehab for 8 weeks last year for 3mmc addiction and in rehab they've taught me that if cravings start to appear, just experience it and just observe the sensations that you're feeling in your body. After a while you'll see that the cravings disappear again.
Cravings never stay so just don't act on it, just let it be.

After a couple weeks/months you'll notice that the sensations become less intense and the cravings don't come up as often.

Other than that just always remember why you're quitting and never glorify the substance, instead assoiciate it with all the negatives that it has, and realise that there is a lot more negatives of using than there is positives, not to mention that the postive effects are always short lived, and the negatives mostly aren't.

I hope people who are in withdrawal are able to get some motivation from this, you can do it!",39

Even less ideas on what to do about it.,"So I've slowly come to realize I don't even know who the hell I am anymore. I know who I used to be years ago and what I used to like and all that but I'm just not that guy anymore. I still have some of the same interests but dulled down so much idk if I'm really interested in them or just want to be because I used to be. And I'm definitely not happy. I'm sad sometimes but a large majority of the time I just don't feel anything at all. I'm just numb. I wake up and don't know what to do with myself, and mostly just wait for the day to be over and do it again. 


I just recently got a car again and started door dashing for cash because I'm kinda homeless rn, I'm staying on my sister's couch but that could end any day now. I'm 28 [m] I have 2 kids and I do love them very much but their mother left me when I relapsed again. I don't want to do drugs, I don't want to worry about being sick if I can't afford them I don't want any of the bullshit that comes with it but here I am. I know I've fucked up too many times I'll never have my family back together like I used to and always wanted, but anyways I'm kinda getting off track.


I can't go to rehab again, I can't afford it and have no where to leave my car. And also I am afraid that when I do quit I will have too many emotions, thoughts, memories, etc to deal with and no way to know how to deal with them, but then again last time I got sober I only really got emotional for a week or so and then was back to just barely existing. I have no family at all that I can lean on and no friends. My children's mother was my best friend and the only woman I ever really loved but she truly doesn't get anything about my disease. She thinks I just woke up and decided I'd rather be a junky than a father and husband and that I love the drugs more than them. I wish that were true sometimes. At least then it would make sense. I fucking hate these drugs. I don't even get high anymore doesn't even matter how much I do.


Also whether I get sober or not anytime soon I have no idea how to face all the problems I'm facing. My sister is bound to ask me to leave any day now, I literally have no one to call on or ask for help, I am completely alone now. So housing is a huge concern. My car has a few minor issues but im not sure what exactly they are or what they would cost to fix, I haven't even been able to afford insurance yet. I don't waste all my money on drugs either I just have been way too depressed to get a job let alone not actually having a way to get to one until I got the car a few days ago, and also my criminal background is not exactly blank, I've got a few Felonys and more than a few misdemeanor, cause obviously I'm a horrible, big bad druggie who needs to be kept from having a future.


I sell enough of my DOC rn that it pays for itself, maybe a few bucks thrown in here or there but I've slowed waaaaaaay down from IV over a G a day to snorting a line only when I'm getting sick and trying to make them smaller each time. But I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of not caring about anything. I hung out with someone I haven't seen in a long time the other day and I didn't really have anything to say, I listened to them but didn't really care what they had to say, I had no idea what we could even go and do, like what go drink? Ummm walk around a park? What do people like to do?

I want to keep going but this post is already way too long. I'm sorry for droning on. I feel like a waste of space and a waste of everyone's time. I think I might need therapy or a psychiatrist or something but idk how to even find one and get started with that.



TL;DR: I am tired of never feeling any real emotions and idk how to fix it. I'm in a very bad situation, homeless NO friends or family none at all and very little money, I want to be happy and normal but idk what that even is, idk who I am or what I like or want to do. Also idk what people do when they hang out together anymore, like wtf is there to really do? I can't afford rehab or put my car anywhere if I did.",12

2021-04-04 06:28:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mjtqng/advice_and_support_appreciated/,Advice and Support Appreciated,"Hey everyone. I hope you are all well. In all honesty, I will probably regret posting this and delete in the morning, but I had probably the biggest slip in my three years of sobriety (aside from the errant marijuana edible) tonight. I don’t feel awful now, but I know I will cry in the morning.

First, I know how judgmental the addiction community can be. Not in a way that actually comes from a place of disdain or disapproval, but there are lots of going philosophies and often they conflict. (Prefacing the rest of this with: “this is mostly stream of consciousness, but I think there will be a discernible point, if you can bear to read something this long. I’ve been sober a long time and have often guffawed at the posts of others: noting a lack of character, discipline, etc, and, so, this is rather humbling for me. I can only hope that I maintain that sense of humility in my future sobriety, so that I can maintain a true sense of compassion for myself and others). Also, I will acknowledge this forthright, if you look at my post history there are numerous examples of me being rude and hurtful towards others. It is a behavior I am trying to correct, which will hopefully become evident through this post. But I also understand if that turns you off to my plight, I absolutely understand why it would.

Leading up to my relapse, I was feeling very emotionally raw. I hate to use what I would qualify as “progressivist buzzwords”, as therapy has now entered the social influencer zeitgeist, but it is a fair characterization of how I have been doing. To provide full context, I have been using kratom for around 5 months from 3 to 12 grams per day. As I never felt out of control or dependent on it, I never saw it as a problem. Prior to that I had 2.5 years of sobriety from alcohol and all other substances, save weed (only started eating low dose edibles after my first two years of complete sobriety). ANYWAYS, I am a perfectionistic and judgmental person by nature (at least previously, there is room for healing). Once I realized just how pessimistic and hateful my worldview had become, I sought professionL help. I want to exist in a world of and to be guided by compassion, understanding, and kindness. I have never expressed those feelings towards myself, even though, on paper, I am successful and I think a genuinely caring human. I saw a therapist this week and cried when we explored some of my previous issues. Not to go into too much depth but I didn’t even REALIZE how fucked up my perspective had gotten. I hate myself, I think I’m ugly, and I do not have understanding for the person I see in the mirror. Anyways, it all boils down to a fear of failure and a fear of effort that I’ve always had.

Fast forward to tonight. It is 3AM I have done .5 grams of coke, about 3mg of XANAX and then drank RUBBING ALCOHOL. This makes me feel very sad. But I can’t even imagine how sad I will feel tomorrow. I am constantly worried about finding a girlfriend and feeling absolutely unworthy, even though I date a lot and get attention. Everything I do is just seen through the lens of being a loser that no woman would ever like. It has been very difficult for me to live my life independent of dating for the last three years (obviously a big deal). Anyways, I went on aGreat date today, the best date I’ve ever had possibly, but then I came home and did this. I felt like it was a long time coming, but the introduction of rubbing alcohol really perturbs me. I will be telling my closest friends but not my parents until a month or so goes by. My biggest fear is basically how I am going to feel over the next week. I mean, I’m assuming it’s going to be shitty, but I can grin and bear that. I’d honestly really appreciate some encouraging words. I do not have any substances in the house left. I know I will feel suicidal tomorrow (will not act). I’m really trying to learn to be less judgmental of others and when moments like this hit, I realize the power in empathy. Thank you all for reading, I’m sure it was gibberish.",2

I overdosed and was hospitalized for a week. I live with my parents and during my hospitalization my mother told me she was using the $400 she found with my stash to open a bank account for me. I don't have an ID so I can't open one myself. 

My gut told me not to trust her with my money because she's very money hungry. She charges me down to the penny for my phone bill and demands the money a week before it's due. She doesn't work and gets a set amount every month from my dad so she has always hounded me for money any way possible. 

I've been out of the hospital for almost three weeks and tonight is the first time I've mentioned the money. I desperately need new contacts and she told me she would order them for me weeks ago. They are covering my expenses until I get my life together. So tonight I asked her to order them and she said ""well let me see if I can afford it."" I said ""I need to be able to see and I asked about them a while ago."" Then she started getting defensive about them costing too much so I said ""fuck it, use the money in my account then"" (they told me to keep that as savings and not to worry about living expenses). Then she drops the bomb ""it wouldn't be enough."" I said ""I have at least $400 in there."" She replied ""you only have the $100 you gave me to open the account."" She continued to gaslight me and said that because I was high that I don't know what I'm talking about. I clearly know how much money I had. What fiend doesn't know fucking exactly how much money they have?! She also said ""I'm taking the $400 to open a savings account.""

I know this is a long rant but I'm fucking furious. Tonight was the first night I felt ready to be around them again and we were cooking dinner and going to watch a movie. It's a small thing but it was a huge step for us and she fucking ruined it. She ruins everything. I feel so betrayed, so furious. I want to get high so fucking badly. I don't know what to do. I want to break shit. I want to scream. I fucking hate my life.

*Keep in mind that we are an upper middle class family. She only steals from me because she's an alcoholic, addicted to going to fancy bars every fucking night and my dad is only at this house on weekends so she's limited to her monthly stipend from him. I know that I'm lucky in many ways but it's only because of my father. My mother has been the source of so much pain my entire life. I was really trying to start over for my sobriety's sake but if I can't trust her then I can't have her in my life.*",1

I am also a neuropharmacologist and strive to decrease stigma surrounding addiction and recreational drug use.

While sitting in recovery meetings, I have been struck repeatedly with how different the way people with addiction history describe their first use experience vs. people in the general public who have had no struggle with addiction. 

I often hear something akin to 'when I first used I felt like I had found the answer to x' - for me this was certainly the case - when I first used freshman year of high school I felt like I had finally found the answer to my crippling social anxiety, hyperarousal, and trauma nightmares - I finally felt 'normal'.

To me, this supports the notion that drug addiction is a symptom of something larger (e.g., underlying trauma, mental illness, absent social support) and is not the drugs themselves driving addiction outcomes like many at addiction researchers and NIDA would have us believe. 

Hoping others are willing to share their first use story (and whether they self-identify as as having a history of addiction and/or problematic drug use) so that we may explore this potential difference in first use within a larger community setting.",10

For many, sexting or delivering sexually explicit material via electronic devices can turn into an addiction.

This addiction to sexting isn’t really a diagnosable mental state condition. However, many specialists believe that it can be an element of sexual addiction and it can adversely affect day-to-day functioning.

# What Is Sexting?

>*Sexting means the act of sending intimately explicit communications, pictures, photos, or videos via mobile phone, computer, or any electronic unit. Sexting may include photos and videos containing nudity or showing simulated intercourse acts. Also, it can involve texts, personal communications, or email messages that discuss or propose sexual functions.*

Not totally all sexting is harmful or addicting. Couples may send sexts as an element of their romantic or sexual activity.

Sexting is usually carried out intentionally, with people delivering sexts about themselves. But often, sext communications may contain intimately explicit material about other individuals without their consent. Also, Sexts can be sent to people who don’t even desire to receive such intimately explicit material.

As sexting is a very recent phenomenon, therefore it’s not yet been acceptably investigated. And authorities have still not exercised any healthier restrictions to sexting. But, many individuals are finding themselves in big trouble over intimately explicit sexts.

Among the worst-case situations, is when teenagers sext sexually explicit images of their own. And so later on, they are accused of the circulation of child pornography.

# Signs of Sexting Addiction

Specific people are much more likely than others to adopt the actions of sexting. For instance, individuals with:

* A different type of sexual addiction
* Confused body image
* Low self-esteem
* Untreated sexual dysfunction

So how can you know if sexting is now an addiction for you or somebody you worry about?

Similar to every addiction, sexting turns into a life’s major issue. As if it is interfering together with your day-to-day activities or producing harmful effects on your personal or professional life.

For example, it’s an issue if the sexting stops you from finishing work or college obligations. Moreover, it is possible for you to spend hours sexting than going to social or family functions.

Still another sign of addiction is sexting with someone behind your partner’s proper back or sexting with multiple partners to obtain a “fix”. It is not necessary that an addict knows their identity or possesses any intent to make individual relationships.

# Sexting and Sex Addiction

Mobile phones are making sexting constantly available. This has intensified sexting addiction. In reality, some estimates declare that the most typical subtype of internet addiction is online porn addiction and sexting.

Sexting could be a symptom or manifestation of intimate addiction. It is a sickness like other addictions, resulting in destructive effects. For some, sexting may be the primary behavior tangled up in sexual addiction.

For other people, the primary focus of addiction can be an all-consuming fascination with pornography, sexual encounters with sex workers, pathological infidelity, or cybersex relationships.

Sexual addiction relates to obsessive and compulsive ideas and actions. Therefore, they have no capacity to manage behavior. Even if the addiction is destroying finances, self-esteem, and household relationships.

Just like other addictions, sexual addiction is progressive. This means the addict of [sexual addiction](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/143/5/e20183183) will spend money and much more time and effort performing particular actions of addiction.

Also, sex addicts frequently seek more intense experiences. Once the addiction advances to experience the same “high” they adopt more harmful tasks.

# Therapy

Dealing with a sexting addiction usually calls for help from specialists. Indeed, it will be an incredibly complicated task to end this addiction. This is because refraining through mobile usage isn’t really practical today. With that urge constantly at your fingertips, sext addicts should be vigilant about relapsing.

Therapies may include advice from psychologists. And psychologists can give the best treatment options, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). It is really effective in aiding you or somebody you worry about. It can help you to develop practical relapse avoidance abilities while you address sexting addiction.

Your relationships might have suffered because of your sexting, so family therapy can also be an element of your recovery. It is possible that you may not find any established medicines for treating sex addiction. But, Psychologists can recommend medications for those who have co-occurring anxiety or mood condition.

Sexting and pornography addiction are becoming more prevalent these days. So there are many new inpatient and outpatient facilities centered on dealing with these problems, have grown to be obtainable in all areas of the world.

Also, a self-help support system such as [Sex Addicts Anonymous helps ](https://www.verywellmind.com/find-a-support-group-meeting-near-you-69433)attain and keep recovery.

To be honest I don’t think I’ve been as heart broken over anything in my life as this. He and both have had decent amounts of clean time (14 months me, 18 months him). I relapsed and lost connection with the program. He stayed connected for a while. But naturally when he wanted to relapse me hit me up. I was reluctant but he let me know he’s getting high with or without me. I’d rather him with me because at least I know he’s safe. I don’t do opiates only “speedy” stuff so that’s all he was able to do around me. Call me a hypocrite but I don’t like dope and it’s not permitted in my home. Everyday we were together. Well then he starts lying and being weird and I knew he started dope. I begged and pleaded him to just do the meth and stay away from the dope. One day he went home went to bed and never woke up. He copped some dope. Now my sponsor was closer with him than me he’s like a son to her. I reached out to her and she cussed me up and down letting me know it was all my fault he was gone. I encouraged him to go back everyday just about but he couldn’t. I didn’t want him out here dead. I just don’t see how I could have done anything any different. As terrible as I feel already I can’t have the rooms blaming me. I did the best I could.",14

Just sharing my one of my first nights without having to lose my guard to weed,"Lemme tell you guys. I'm a teen struggling with relapsing weed addiction. The longest time I was clean was for a month when I had a job. But I quit that job and instantly went back on weed after a pretty healthy month. I can tell you literally this second at 3 am, this is the first night I spent to myself. Like the first time in ages, just being a normal teenager, staying up late, and literally made myself feel better with nostalgia music. 

Didn't even have to spend an entire hour smoking as much as I could to be so fucked up that I couldn't recognize my surrounding room and literally having the paranoia of a rabid animal (I'd even fucking salivate and drool. No idea if others can relate at all. Just literally sitting there like a dumb wild animal waiting to gorge a bowl of cheetos). 

Even the nostalgic music gave me some gender euphoria, just thinking about the future of becoming the guy I've always thought about needing to be and just fucking dancing to LMFAO and Dj Snake (I actually forgot how much gender euphoria these fucking artists give transgenders and I don't even think they know it. Though I was younger so I had no idea that this was a gender thing for me. I thought everyone else did it). Just having the confidence and fun like any normal guy. Weed is so shitty for me that I'd actually be sitting in denial, shutting down, or questioning my confidence in my identity had I smoked tonight. 

 I've only had these healthy nights to myself way before my addiction. After my addiction it was just almost every night getting as high as I can to escape reality. I just have a fat glob of green sitting under my dresser and for once I don't even feel like doing it at all. Don't gotta wake up with a shitty greenout hangover from it either. Feeling good and finally feeling a little free. 

Y'all really have a chance at getting better, it's pretty shitty baby steps. Like literally watching a newborn attempting to skip. But y'all really got this, and you gotta really try and try again to start walking again. I'm probably just saying shit that you've heard the entire time trying to recover but I'm serious, take care of yourselves.",11

The drinking age where I live is 18 and my mom doesn't really care either way if I drink or not. My mom is super lenient when it comes to most things and she always trusts me to make smart decisions. She never involves herself unless I want her too

Since she's so casual and trusting with things like this she keeps her alcohol easily accessed. She doesn't expect me to take it but it's very easy to steal when she's at work and I don't think she's ever noticed

I stole a lot of alcohol when I was still 17 and kinda like tested my limits a bit. My mom only drinks the hard stuff, so I got used to it quick

Now that I'm 18 I feel like I can drink in front of my mom but I still keep a stash of stolen stuff in my bedroom

I worry of drinking to much in front of her because I don't want her to notice anything, so I only occasionally have drinks with her. She usually has like a nightcap but she sees me drink I'd say about 3/4 times a week. Otherwise I use my stash. My older sister rarely drinks

I only really drink to the point of being drunk like twice a week and end up buzzed or tipsy about 3 or 4 days 

I worry it's getting to be an issue because it's now kinda instinct for me to drink. When I'm frustrated, angry, upset, bored, wanting to have a fun night, etc etc I think to myself ""I need a drink""

I feel like I'm obsessing too much over alcohol but I don't know if it's just a normal teenager thing. Kids at school will drink at like parties or stuff (pre-covid of course) but I feel like they don't think about it too much outside of the appropriate occasions

Am I reading too much into this? Is it actually a problem or am I just bring a rebellious teen haha. If I am on the road to problems what should I do?

It felt like my body was giving me a last warning that if I continued on with my usage, I would surely die. I’ve had a lot of close calls but this one really snapped me out of it.

I saw a doctor today, a psychiatrist.
It didn't go that well but it went okay maybe.
I meet this woman whose at least 65, n she asks if the training doctor can sit in. ""Sure.."" I really don't care I just waited a month to be seen, after a year sober and a year n a half off of medications. I just really do not care, I had a lot to say and I am allotted 1 hour so it spilled...


I am already beyond stressed, anxious, I feel beyond judged by them n the entire world  just based on my appreance alone.. I've been so paranoid too n it has been hell inside my head for longer than I care to admit.

She begins asking those dumb intrusive questions that make my skin crawl. 
I honest and upfront about ALL OF IT, and that's a first for me.
She of course asked the basics like if I am suicidal, want to hurt myself or others blah blah blah. 
Gotta say no to all that shit or else I'd get pink slipped.
So, I'm honest but not honest enough to be admitted, if that makes any sense.
Getting into my past drug history made me feel sick, I welled up with tears and anger n there was no holding it back..

So, she says you were taking meth for over a year.
""Yeah, I did that. Been off the shit since February of 2020 and any other harder drug plus booze have been cut from my diet."" 
So I tell her I still smoke cigs, weed n drink coffee. 
I want to quit cigs n coffee first, cigs are now effecting my health.
She however thinks marijuana is bad for EVERYONE. 
Not just those on meds, or with schizophrenia..weed is not beneficial for anyone. 
She voiced her opinion but not as loud as I did mine.

I replyed ""I think weed is a little better than hooting n smoking crack, meth n coke tho.. right?""

She peered over her glasses at me n kept typing.
I welled up with fury, how many times am I going to feel like shit for being myself? 
Why do I have to censor myself for them?

She asks me how much weed a day I smoke... Lmao uhhh all day everyday? She then say ""so, what..like 8 joints a day?"" 
I say ""yeah something like that..""
""Doesn't that get expensive???""
I said ""what? Yeah, my partner works tho so we can handle it."" (Not that that was any of her business but...)
She said that helps.
""Yeah, it helps to have a bf that works so I don't have to."" 
Fucking cunt. I do have an income it's just not this woman's business. I am an online sex worker n artist, I also received ssi plus able to work a lil so I do all that n manage fine.

She asks my about my diet too, ""no I don't eat healthy, I don't think too much about food since I recovered from my ED in 2009.""
Another judgey look for Dr. BetterThanMe

I interrupted her and asked about any pro weed docs, or idk maybe someone who would understand me more. 
Weed is the only thing I've had since all this began that truly has helped me. 

Now cos of my drug history, she went as far as to ask about my teeth :(  she was ""genuinely curious"" or some shit.

I had also told her I suffered from bulimia as a kid (13-20) n then the almost 2 years on meth. I hope she asked because of my ed but I assume she thinks I am still an addict n idk if I care anymore.
On or off drugs I am manic, I talk a lot and I talk fast. I am animated and extreme with my moods, I have constant emotional and anger outbursts.

Anyway, I ended up pulling my mask down n showed her my teeth With an attitude (I can't help that she was a cunt)

They are fucking perfect, beyond having one abscess removed, a few chips n cavities and yellow from smoking, my teeth ain't that bad..n I'm in the process of getting those fixed too. 
Made me feel like shit none the less...

It was like any time this woman had a chance to passive aggressively condensed me, she would n she liked to do it.

Fuck.

She then ended up saying something n I replyed 
""Everyone has it hard, life is hard.""

This bitch says ""yea, n some have it harder than others ."" 
Bitch. Thanks for reminding me, I'm fucking trash I get it...
I had little to no control over the things I experienced throughout my life n I also wouldn't change a fucking thing about my past even if I could.
Fucking made me who I am n I am proud of who tf I am.

I told her about my traumas, my rape, my drug history,.my phsychosis that started long before my drugs addiction ever did. I told her about my family mental health history, and my 6 years as a young kid with bulimia, & that i never met my biological father..and how I began hearing things at age 7, and stopped sleeping around that same time, plus panic attacks, couldnt focus etc, I had no idea what was wrong then...

 I explained that after a lifelong battle of debilitating mental illness I fucking gave up n started using drugs, sex n booze to ecsape n cope from my own mind. 
From the years of 2007-2018 I tried endlessly to seek out n get the help I needed.
Unfortunately then nothing worked, n ultimately I was young n not ready to accept my fate. Still hard these days to accept it, and truly understand it.

I start vraylar today as a mood stabilizer.
Been on it before but was also still using drugs n drinking so did not work at all. Oops.

So I showed her the list 25+ meds deep of my past med history (what I can recall :() 
I expressed how fearful I am of the side fx, in the past the side fx were extreme & some  meds ended up hurting me more than helping me in the end.

I am scared, and I don't trust them just as they don't me.

I told her I used to have a problem with benzos, xanax n k pins were my favorite thing ever for a while.
I told her I have taken vistarile, n she asked if I wanted any.
Lmao, no.i got benadryl at my house but thank u.
I told her I'd really rather learn healthy ways to deal n cope with shit for once so I don't have to rely on anxiety meds, or antihistamines.
Just whatever med they think will help stabilize my ass so I can function in society like I once had.
Therapy is in a month. 
I hope my therapist isn't like my doctor.. jfc.

I want to write more about this but I am getting angry thinking about it. I can't ever find a normal doctor, I am going to bite the bullet tho n at least try her fucking way before I give up.

Before being admitted I could not even get pizza from the delivery guy, let alone go out in public. My social anxiety was so bad from 5 years of heavy poly-use.

Whilst doing the program and later completing it I felt bullet proof, thought of drugs disgusted me. 

I've been out for 2 weeks and I am back where I was in terms of anxiety and sense of purpose.  Still sober, but I am finding it so incredibly hard to fight the urge to relapse even though I cut off all of my old friends and drug acquaintances who are no good for me.

Is it supposed to be this hard?

2021-04-02 03:32:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/mifd0z/am_i_an_addict/,Am I an addict?,"I (16M) have been in and out of psychiatric units since the start of 2021. During those inpatient stays I was given benzos (diazepam) to help with anxiety/suicidal thoughts. In between stays I wasn't taking benzos and coped without it, but would get readmitted a few weeks later due to mental health crisis, where they would give be benzos again. After my final stay I was taken to an outpatient unit where I was given diazepam every day for 3 weeks, and when I was discharged they gave me a supply to last a couple more weeks. So, all in all, I have been taking diazepam for about two months straight. 

I can't get through the day without taking it, sometimes because I crave the relief and sometimes because I'm afraid of the consequences (eg. panic attacks, becoming suicidal again) of not taking it, and more and more often I am taking more than the prescribed dose because the amount the doctors recommended doesn't feel like enough. I am terrified for the day that my supply runs out. 

I am a nicotine addict and I have accepted that, but I'm starting to recognize similar symptoms of addiction/withdrawal with benzos. I don't drink often but when I do I drink excessively, and I do this knowing that benzos and alcohol are a dangerous combination. 

I don't think I have a problem but I also don't know what I'll do when I stop talking it. Should I be concerned that I have developed an addiction?",3

I can't seem to get myself to stop drinking and seeking drugs consitently. This is causing me a lot of emotional turmoil. I'm ready to admit that my habits arent serving me well. I've lost myself completely and I need to change what im doing. I've tried a lot of things to get sober but I refuse to commit and I've learned that I'm actually fake. I've been ""getting sober"" for 5 years and I feel as though nobody trusts or respects me. I'm afraid of opening up to people. My childhood was traumatic and the way I've coped with it has left me with a list of bad coping skills. I'm emotionally unstable and Ive allowed myself no capacity for love. I don't seem to care about anything anymore. It makes me sick. I've given up hope that I can ever find the courage to make a consistent effort towards change. my entire existence has become a crisis. I struggle to get myself to relax. I'm worried I will lose my job and become a danger to myself and others if I continue on this path, or just be this way for the rest of my life at best. I think the truth is that I've lost myself and I don't want to change because its hard. I've crashed and burned. My friends and family that still talk to me have left all unanimously agree I need to get therapy, but im so scared to open up and change. I don't know why im so comfortable being this fake person and doing the same thing when it hurts so bad, but I know I need to make an effort and do something different. I can't maintain this. I need help believing in myself.

Two days ago, I had a panic attack that was exasperated by some mild alcohol withdrawal symptoms (nausea, shakes, dehydration, blurred vision). I ended up going to ER to be put on fluids and meds. When I was discharged, the doctor gave me a short term prescription for Xanax (I take an antidepressant already but have been wanting to take something else for my anxiety for a while now). He also referred me to some addiction counselors, but said that my withdrawal symptoms and alcohol dependence were not serious/deadly. 
A family friend of mine recently died in her sleep from alcoholism and an eating disorder, which is what fuels my anxiety of alcohol withdrawals. I am not sure my dependence is bad enough that I need to remain sober forever, but I would like to try remain alcohol free at least until 1) I am not longer taking Xanax, 2) my alcohol tolerance lowers significantly, and 3) until I secure a new job (my current job allows me to drink often because it’s stressful and I work odd hours from home). 
I’m very concerned about staying away from alcohol as it’s only been two days and it’s been hard to not think about. Any advice is welcome!

As I'm writing this, I'm sure you (reader) will say ""duh you id\*ot..."" ....... but I think I'm addicted to listening to YouTube or anything else I can play in my ear to distract me partially while doing tasks and inevitably simultaneously ruining myself as a person.

So here it is... I haven't been able to find anything that can I relate to in regards to what I'm going through with this. I wake up and immediately need to play some kind of content in my ear to be entertained.... but it's made me a failure as a person. I'm a pretty intelligent girl who has been stunted in life because I can't focus on anything enough to succeed because I get absorbed in content i'm listening to and I'm too distracted to engage in anything fully. I've called it an addiction because I've noticed it's obviously caused issues in my life... but I can't stop. I wake up and need to put headphones in immediately to be entertained... if only for a little bit while I get ready for the day.... but a few videos turns into HOURS... turning into an ""I'll restart my day tomorrow the right way"" situation. I just listen to content ALL DAY. Can anyone relate to this??? I literally feel like the biggest moron but it's my only comfort and no one I speak to can understand or relate in the slightest... it's even potentially (don't let me lie... it IS ) the reason I might mess up college.... kills off my social life.... and makes me feel like a shell of a human. I'm smart enough to analyze what's happening... but can't stop... I'd even rather clean all day than do anything in regards to school and it's close to the point of being too late for me... I'm even in my last semester in school AND I CAN'T STOP EVEN FOR THAT. I'm sinking here... give me some psychoanalysis here please. I'm not crazy, just feel like no one else does this so I'm addicted and weak AF.

I used to be like the everyday man, watching porn on the hub or going to a free live cam site such as Chaturbate. While I knew what OF was, I never thought to get into it as I thought that paying for subscriptions was stupid when you can get porn for free. However, late last year someone I knew from school (a beautiful woman who graduated) started an OF. I decided ""Ouuuu she is really pretty, I bet 1 month wouldn't hurt"". I bought one month, then another, then another. A few months in, I found other girls that drew my interest. As subscriptions are, many can rack up in monetary expense. I found myself buying left and right, but it was minor to what it is now since I mostly got ""free trials"". Once the latest 1400 stimmy hit, and the credit rebate from last year's hit (1800) as well, I hit rock bottom. I saw this monetary gain as a window--a cracked one that is. I then saw people I knew as influencers had one, such as Amanda Cerny or Amouranth, and I said to myself ""a couple dozen dollars couldn't hurt"". I then saw other girls from recommendations, more girls I saw from IG, and girls from elsewhere. Later to my surprise, I've come to spend over $500 on Onlyfans ALONE this month. Shit, today I bought an Amouranth DM video and even purchased Bhad Bhabie's OF for around $25 I believe it was. $150 from the past 3 days alone. Ive tried deleting my account to stop twice already, but I create a new one because ""one subscription won't hurt"". Curiosity and addiction is getting the best of me. I have a serious problem. One of my friends told me to post here, and I was really hoping someone to help. I've probably spent 800 altogether in the past half year. Please, I need guidance.",3

I stole everything that I could in order to get more of what I needed, I let my addiction absolutely control every aspect of my life, and I proceeded to lose absolutely everything and attempt to take my own life because if I continued living in my addiction there was absolutely no road ahead for me. That was my thinking and that’s what I truly believed for years and years. However, I was found during my attempt and saved and placed in a treatment facility that focused on my needs and was very small so I could seriously hone in on the reason why I needed to drink and use in the amount that I did. I put in the work, I completed the treatment program, and with that my blood pressure returned to normal (generally super high) and I was able to get my family back in the next 6 months, which is incredible because in all honesty I thought that I’d never speak to them again. What I do now is I work for a treatment center trying to find people who feel the same way I did and explain that it’s not all lost. If you were anything like me, I can tell you this post wouldn’t do shit at all. I’d say it’s just another bullshit scam to make money and that there’s nothing in this world that can actually save me. I’m here to tell you that while I don’t have a cure to your addiction, I have hope. I have a solution. I have something that can finally give the next struggling addict or alcoholic a thought that there’s a chance, and even if that’s only a thought, from there recovery can begin. I’m a straight up guy, and my only goal is just to help people who were like me in the past. If you feel hopeless, in complete despair, or that life has absolutely nothing to offer except the escape of drugs, why don’t you shoot me a personal message. I can give you my number and we can talk, or we can talk about a family member or friend who’s struggling who just needs anything to try and get them back on their feet and get any kind of grounding.
