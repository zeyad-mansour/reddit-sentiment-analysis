If for some reason it seems like my post is out of place, please direct me to a more adequate subreddit and I'll be happy to repost!

I have a very genuine question for you guys today and would love to hear your input on how to properly defuse enablers within our family.

Now to paint the picture in the fullest, I arrived late to a family gathering and a family member (we will call him Tom) that you would consider to be an alcoholic was already drink in hand. At this point, there wasn't much else to do than carry on with the flow of the night I suppose, so that is exactly what I did. Unfortunately, one drink rapidly turned into five and then suddenly a quadruple rye was poured for himself, because our man Tom quickly loses all self control.

Well... fast forward another couple hours of fun and games and people start packing it up to head on home. Tom is the first to head out, which isn't a problem but what transpired when he left got me to thinking and is the entire reason why I'm posting here.

After he left, a conversation started up about Tom's drinking. How many drinks did he have? Was he into liquor? Is he heading home tonight? The flood gates were open. But unironically, most questions were met with the response of ""Tom is an adult, he can make his own decisions."" This comment, is quite literally the epitome of an enabler to me. My rebuttal was that ""You wouldn't hand heroine to a recovering heroine addict, so what makes you think it's okay to hand drinks to Tom?"" - I was scoffed at as they walked away. Did I respond to the situation correctly? I'm really not trying to vilify anyone. But, as the saying goes, I firmly believe you're a product of your environment. And if even your closest support circle cannot understand the role they have to play, what hope can someone actually have? I believe you need a strong foundation in order to overcome addiction. To me that means no one pushing on those vices.

I'm sorry if this is a little scatterbrained as it's pretty late right now and I'm exhausted.

Again, I'm looking for genuine honest responses and critiques.

*Additional information about Tom. In the past, Tom had confided within me about a number of things. He has tried to stop drinking before, and he believed he was doing a great job. One thing he told me was that he didn't feel like anyone else was noticing his progress so he started to get really down on himself. Eventually losing that battle and falling back into it. I was even told that before he completely relapsed he called me and immediately hung up before I could answer because he KNEW he was going to have a drink and wanted me to speak up to help push through without needing to reach for a bottle.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979320764541626}"

Is having no addictions at all considered normal? I'm thinking default state or a natural way of being.

Since I can think, I've always had some kind of addiction. My addictions often changed and were varying in intensity, but I can't remember a time of my life where I've been completely without addiction. Even in times where there was no hard substance abuse, there was at least something like excessive gaming, internet, porn, coffeine addiction going on.

Is the goal to implement addictions that won't ruin your life or is the goal to get rid of every possible addiction forever? I'm really struggling with this one as I tend to see some kind of lifequality reducing addiction in every person around me.

The Morning After I overdosed Myself
The morning after  overdosed I woke up.

I made myself breakfast in bed. I added salt and pepper to my eggs and used my toast for a cheese and bacon sandwich. I squeezed a grapefruit into a juice glass. I scraped the ashes from the frying pan and rinsed the butter off the counter. I washed the dishes and folded the towels.

The morning after I overdosed, I fell in love. Not with the boy down the street or the middle school principal. Not with the everyday jogger or the grocer who always left the avocados out of the bag. I fell in love with my mother and the way she sat on the floor of my room holding each rock from my collection in her palms until they grew dark with sweat. I fell in love with my father down at the river as he placed my note into a bottle and sent it into the current. With my brother who once believed in unicorns but who now sat in his desk at school trying desperately to believe I still existed.

The morning after I overdosed, I walked the dog. I watched the way her tail twitched when a bird flew by or how her pace quickened at the sight of a cat. I saw the empty space in her eyes when she reached a stick and turned around to greet me so we could play catch but saw nothing but sky in my place. I stood by as strangers stroked her muzzle and she wilted beneath their touch like she did once for mine.

The morning after I overdosed, I went back to the neighbors’ yard where I left my footprints in concrete as a two year old and examined how they were already fading. I picked a few daylilies and pulled a few weeds and watched the elderly woman through her window as she read the paper with the news of my death. I saw her husband spit tobacco into the kitchen sink and bring her her daily medication.

The morning after I overdosed, I watched the sun come up. Each orange tree opened like a hand and the kid down the street pointed out a single red cloud to his mother.

The morning after I  overdosed, I went back to that body in the morgue and tried to talk some sense into her. I told her about the avocados and the stepping stones, the river and her parents. I told her about the sunsets and the dog and the beach.

The morning after I  I overdosed I tryed to unkill myself, but couldn’t finish what I started.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.989727795124054}"

the thing is, relatively, I never even used it that much. tolerance never rose above 140ish IM to hole I did it once and then had a 5 day binge a month or so later but after that I restricted myself to once a month, which became every two weeks, which became once a week, which even that I couldn’t keep to, but I never used more than 2 times in a week rly with a couple of exceptions. 

and I also decided to quit cus I switched my meds and I tried to do k on them and the k did not work at all, but now i’m questioning whether to stay sober because i’m soooo much more mentally stable now, which I mostly attribute to therapy and a different environment. I just miss k so much and wanna try to use again but responsibly this time, set firm boundaries n shit n if I break them, i’m done. also no more needles

and i’m also considering doing the same with other drugs like psychs, possibly stims, and cauuuutiously opiates

the thing is, for k specifically, i’d have to quit my meds. I have suspicions they haven’t rly done much for me, but who knows they could be helping. my psychiatrist and therapist rly think I should stay on them cause if it ain’t broke don’t fix it but also even if it’s j to keep me off of k, but I rly just wanna quit to do k

My husband went to rehab a year ago, for marijuana and pill addiction. As far as I know, he is still clean. However, since returning home his diet slowly went from normal meals and snacks to what now seems like compulsive fast food binges.

He has expressed to me in recent months how much he would like to eat healthier and needs help. But if I offer help, he turns angry and offensive in a way that really feels just like when I'd ask him about the pills. He buys himself stuff from the grocery store when we go but then just lets it rot in the pantry, because he eats at restaurants and fast food places for nearly every meal. Any meals he eats at home, he will have a very small portion and immediately go to eat chips or cookies and drink soda.

At first this wasn't a huge deal, we understood he would still continue to seek out healthier dopamine/serotonin bursts but as it is getting worse instead of better, and his health is seriously declining, I no longer believe this is a small thing.

Does anyone have any advice for me in supporting him or for him in dealing with this? I don't know where to turn.

**TL;SR:** *(too long but still read)*

I am suffering from an addiction. I've only recently classified it as such, until then I've been treating it as pure laziness or a lack of discipline for the last 5 years.

It started when I was 16. I am 21 now.

I classified it as 'masturbation (and porn) addiction'.

I had first watched porn when I was 9, but didn't really knew what it was till 12 than started watching it often since 13.

I do have a suspicion that I was a quite addicted to it then, but I never masturbated till 16. And, the addiction take time to form, it was almost instant from hindsight at least.

But, I was still able to keep up with my academics and top my school. But, since the last three years it had started having adverse effects on my academics and overall health. I have formed extremely difficult obsession with entertainment at frequent intervals. At times I feel physical pain and obsession towards it when I don't do it at regular intervals, Almost an addiction.

I have been able to get through a NoFap challenge for about 2-3 months, but It started again the moment I relapsed, I am assuming I need to change by behavior towards it. Like Captain puts it, *“You start running, they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back... Can’t say no forever, right?”* Mine isn't exactly the same, I just want it to stop bothering me. I don't want it to be my enemy, just something I don't really care about.

I have been looking for help. My college's psychiatrist hasn't replied yet. I am looking for outside therapists and psychiatrist.

I haven't told my parents yet. I don't even know even know how to.

I have been looking on internet, but haven't found anyone who stated this explicitly and I don't know how to interpret. There are a couple of odd rehab centers extremely far from where I live.

But sometimes, I just slip. I over drink. Last night, it was a few drinks with a friend. Nothing outrageous. I should have gone home. But what did I do? Went to another bar, and smashed another many drinks. I have zero idea how I got home in one piece. I have a painful bruise in my hip, I assume I fell?

About six years ago it got so bad when my mom lost her job we had to keep buying her test kits cause she kept failing drug tests. She swore she wasn't smoking anymore but it took her six months and working for a major corporation that refuses to drug test to get a new job.

They stopped and we took measures to rebuild. Even moved in with my daughter and got a house together to get some stability. Recently I was in a car wreck and the other driver wasn't insured so I had to borrow their car to get to work. I work security, armed, and not as a cheap mall cop, we do drills and have to be prepared for actual threats and have off duty cops at our place during the day.  I have been discussing going into law enforcement (I have some background there already) as the pay is slightly better.

Then I came out to their car and one of our off duty guys was standing there and said the car smelled like marijuana. Now I have a pretty bad sense of smell due to years and years of sinus infections so I didn't smell it. Though I think part of it was also that I didn't want to smell it subconsciously. I confronted them and they denied it was there. Now the cop was cool but since I carry a firearm I was looking at a felony 2 with enhancement if the off duty had pressed the issue. So when my parents left I did a quick search, and I do mean quick. Found it in less than sixty seconds. Confronted my father directly without telling him I found it and he still won't own up or admit the issue. We made some excuses and now my wife, daughter, and I are staying at some friends. We are seriously contemplating moving out but I feel guilty because this will sink them financially and probably kill my father as he is in bad health with a bad heart (no, he isn't smoking for medical purposes, in fact all the doctors agreed that would be worse for him). 

We have been through this so many times and they won't change, and in hindsight I see a lot of the signs there and know we are getting to the self-destructive stage they go through. But if you ask them marijuana is never the problem. Nevermind most of our family won't talk to them, their own daughter has spent years barely talking to them, and it's only in the last few years I have reconnected with them and moved in. It hurts to think I could be the one responsible for sabotaging their ability to retire, but I was put at risk of being able to care for my own wife and daughter, losing my career, my job, and a security clearance.

Am I overreacting? Is moving out the right response since nothing I do seems to help them and I only seem to be enabling them?

My girlfriend of two years is addicted to whip its. I have never liked them or messed with them, but she has had issues in the past before I ever knew her with them. She had to go to the hospital because she couldn’t walk years before I met her. For most our relationship it has not been an issue. I didn’t know anything about it until she told me about everything seven months into our relationship. I love her very much, but I’m worried. In the past when she has slipped up she has regretted it and quit them quickly. Positive reinforcement really helped in the past.However this year things have really gotten out of control. She’s depressed and she’s ripping these every day all day now. She works remote and does them off camera while working. She’s extremely smart and she knows she’s fucking up. It’s a fat bastard I eat because I’m sad and I’m sad because I eat catch 22. I never do them and tell her I’m not ok with it, she has to stop, and she’s too good for it, etc and to throw it away. It’s been weeks since shes been lucid. She knows it’s a problem and says she’s giving it up that day only to order them at the slightest inconvenience the next. In the past positive reinforcement helped get her back on track, but anything I try now only serves to upset her and throw her into a rage. She says mean stuff when confronted about it, brings up old fights unrelated so she gets the spotlight off her, doesn’t make sense, gas lights, and generally a toad then passes out on the couch. She’s never been like this and it’s not who she is. That said I’m worried and I can’t leave her in this dark spot. She been through a lot, and been there for me in rough seas. I’m just looking for advice and help. I’m trying to be stern and not enable but also trying to make her feel loved and not alone. Im on a knives edge and I’m getting tired of having the same fights over the same thing over and over. She doesn’t remember what she said and therefore there never closure to the things she says when she’s on the whippets. Please help.

I moved in with my mom,
Well here recently, 
We were fighting non stop and I got kicked out / left due to the violence .

I somehow fucked up my relationship with my gf (like most addicts do) . 

And I’m here alone, with no one.
Struggling. 26 with 3 kids
Caught in between the responsible adult trying to fight and push thru for my kids knowing they deserve better. And wanting to give up and just tap out. 

Anyone who suffered with these two specific drugs , together.
Meth and subutex, any tips?
I’ve been on almost every drug out there but fuck man these two together it’s like no escape.
My irritation and frustration sky rockets so quick like never before, when I try and go without I feel like shit the next day (never felt dope sickness set in so quick) it’s like if I have one or the other I’m still dope sick I need both to feel normal.
I just wana get clean.
Everyone in my family (support group) is also addicts.
I want someone to keep my kids for a week or two so I can get clean but I don’t think it’s gonna happen.
So I’ll have to do it with all 3 and anyone who has kids knows it’s fucking hard. 
Any feedback including negative is welcome.
I’m ready to be judged by the world .

Then hospitalized with an i.v of antibiotics around the clock. Throughout my blood work and being the sickest I've ever felt in my life , I received news that I dodged valve replacement surgery . Which was extremely great news to me. I was released in time for Thanksgiving with special instructions to stay clean continue my subutex treatment. Also with monthly follow ups and antibiotics still 3 times a day. The Doctor from infectious disease has given me nothing but support. I mean really looked out for me , since I stayed sober I was eligible for hep c treatment . Relieved the meds finished my 8 weeks of it. Around the same time I'm told that I no longer have to take my anti biotics. Everything is great I hit 10 months clean from heroin for the first time since I started using in 2014. Then I had a follow up where I was scheduled to get a ultra sound of my heart pretty much. My results came back that my heart murmur is being caused from the damage that I had done to my valve. Which has lead to me finding out that 100% chance of the valve replacement surgery is happening within the next couple years. I know this is alot, and a long story that may seem drawn out to say I'm still scared to have the surgery.  Ima scheduled to meet to get some kind of date in place.

2021-08-28 00:42:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pd3f42/double_withdraw/,Double withdraw,"Hey I’m on day 4 of cold Turkeying Nicotine,   And would like to explain to you some of the withdrawals of it, along with the withdrawals in reduction of Cannabis use. 

Day 1: I just landed for my Vacation, yes I am trying to quit while on vacation. I’ll be here for 7 days. I had no appetite what so ever and I mean none! Food would actually disgust me, can’t tell if this is a withdrawals symptoms of Cannabis or Nicotine, I’ll go with Cannabis, since that is the more recently acquired taste and since I have done a whole diet while using puff bars, they don’t really mess with your food intake and appetite. I didn’t really feel the affects on days 1 I had really bad urges for Nicotine but that was about it. 

Day 2: was the beginning of 2 of the most shittiest days of my life. I don’t know if it’s the Toronto weather, (I’m from California) or the withdrawals, but I have been getting cold  sweats which started mid day of day 1. 
These cold sweats are no joke, when it stars I just want to stop moving and curl up into a ball and wait for it to pass. I am normally a emotional person but I have been in control of my own emotions of whole life, while on withdrawals I feel so emotional, TOO emotional again since I am trying to reduce Cannabis and cold Turkey nicotine I can’t tell which is making me feel this way. I easily cry over things I normally wouldn’t cry over, I’m a man, yes we cry but damn this ain’t me. 
 

Day 3: this day was the hardest and I kept telling myself that I want to stop using Nicotine badly, I want it for myself I know I do, because I don’t have that same feeling of wanting stop for Weed. This strong feeling of wanting to stop is only Nicotine, it is what it is, one battle at a time. This day was also the hardest day out of all so far, I was constantly having cold sweats, and had to stop every now and then to breathe and sort of meditate while the urges and feelings is out of my system for a bit. I have to be honest doing this while on vacation is helping, I have been constantly going outside and have average about 3 miles a day walking. Being out and doing other activities keeps my mind clear and helps. Mind you, this was a was physical and mentally challenging day, so I did use my wax pen for weed at the end of the day to sleep. I have only started smoking weed more recently about 3 months. I don’t think I have the same powerful urges I get for Nicotine for Cannabis, in a way I have more control over my weed use than I do Nicotine. 

Day 4: the urges are still there and I kinda regret using my wax pen on the night of day 3, i still get really bad urges and some cold sweats, again I have to say my vacation is helping a ton with this process. The reason I regret using my wax pen is because since I had not hit it for a few days and once I did hit it on the night of day 3 I felt it more stronger and you really don’t want that with weed. Through the night I kept feeling myself being awake and having my head feel like it was spinning like crazy. It was making me feel nauseous. Over all day 4 was also hard but easier than day 3. 

I am on Vacation for 7 days and plan to stay off of nicotine the whole time, I believe if I do so I would be past the hardest parts of withdrawals and hopefully can stay off of Nicotine once I get to the states. Again I’ll be completely honest I mentioned I smoked weed starting for the last 3 months, I didn’t mention that the last month, I think I was high almost everyday. That’s why I have reduced the amount I smoke everyday, I don’t plan of cold turkeying weed because i believe that in moderation, weed is sort of a steroids for my personality. I still DO NOT WANT to get hooked on it and use it everyday every hour. More like 1-3 times a week but I know I can’t promise that. All I can say since I have reduced Cannabis is that I am very emotional and feel like I don’t have control over my emotions.

From 8 years ago to 5 years ago i took 200mg of tramadol daily. It helped a lot with the pain. But i was constantly in a bad high. I call it bad because it made me nauseous and dizzy, but also made me feel slightly good. I quit them cold turkey 3 years ago because these side effects were making me slow and stupid and id rather be in more pain. I had three weeks of withdrawal but i had zero issues with it and did not feel an ounce of ""i want to take them!""

Fast forward three years and ive started taking 50mg kodein daily instead, less side effects but also less pain reduction. Overall better than the tramadol.

But i love these meds so much it scares me. I cant tell if its the high or the fact that the pain reduction makes me able to have a semblance of a normal life again. When i didnt take them i didnt go outside my house more than maybe 30 times in 3 years. Now im out meeting people once a week.

Weed was introduced to me at 11, didn’t like it the beginning I didn’t feel “high” and I felt like my lungs were inside out (but smoked one of my moms cigarettes I stole from her after I tried the weed)

So weed: I’ve only quit weed once for 31 days when I was 17 (I’m 21) I took a tolerance break and felt only restless and irritable for like 48 hours (this is before my worst drug consumption) but after that I felt better and more active but went back to weed cause the high I love. I love being mellowed out and quickly.

So now stimulants (coke adderall/vyvanse and meth): coke to me is a joke. Pricey for good stuff and lasts 20 minutes then I want more. So I can’t say I had a addiction just about a week long party binge while I did other drugs and lines of coke cause it was offered. (I’ll get into the mixtures) now meth was an accident that fucked me up. I did what I thought was mdma but was methbomb… I liked the feeling though and for 4 days I went through 1.8 grams of meth and stayed up the whole time. (I remember it hitting me that I was seeing things when I thought trailer park boys was 3D coming out at me. And the lights felt like rays then I fell asleep sitting up for 16 hours) 
Now adderal and vyvance were my favs. 1 pill 12 hours of geek 6 hour comedown unless you take another. Did 60mg of instant release a day for about 2 months. When I quit I felt dead. Drained. Couldn’t eat for about 6 days unless I did xanax or weed.

Opiates opioids: here’s the thing with these. The highs are alllll almost similar it’s just, how strong? Or how long do you wanna feel relief or a buzz. I could type pages of different types of painkillers but I’ll go in order to the rhythm of my slope into rock bottom 

Started with nicotine or cigs, weed, then Xanax and that was years of use. Quit but turned to Vicodin. From there oxy and OxyContin. Then to hydromorphone (my fav strongest and long lasting snortable pill for 15 for a days for me vs 80 on oxy for a day) then after that was the fentanyl patch. Realized that I was stuck sick and needed to quit. Got on subs for 4 months then kratom then weened off.

Withdrawals are what you make them-after you’re done shitting your pants, puking, losing weight from no appetite, no sleep with rls and cold sweats. After that it’s mental and I’m trying to type more on my phone but it’s slow so that’s my story you can message me if you wanna know what else and how I dealed with my situation",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.995922327041626}"

About a month ago I purchased my first bag of meth and had been smoking it everyday up until this past Sunday. 

Ever since I started using it chronically, my health has been in a free fall. About a week ago I noticed a lump in my chest and in the past week it’s gotten larger and more lumps have appeared. My collar bones have also started to swell and I developed a low temperature, rapid heart rate, pain in my side and back, and a variety of other issues. I realized that something was seriously wrong with my body and went to the hospital where I was treated for a blood/bone infection. Despite taking antibiotics at home, my condition seemed to start getting worse again. 

On Sunday I took a big hit off my bowl and immediately felt terrible. I remember tasting the bitterness of the meth as it hit my lips and tongue and finally understood that if there is something wrong with my body and if I actually want to get better I needed to stop, right then. 

After pondering for a few minutes, I grabbed my bag and dumped what was left of it down the toilet (about a gram). I then grabbed my pipe, rinsed it out and threw it in the garbage.

I immediately regretted the decision but was also really proud of myself. Even though it was an impulsive thing to do, I haven’t felt much of a craving, instead of focusing on cravings I’ve been paying attention to how much better I’ve started to feel since I quit. My lumps in my chest are going down, my collar bones are less swollen, I’ve been sleeping for hours and hours and finally eating again. 

I’m physically exhausted and severely depressed but I know that’s just a part of the process. I’m scared that I’m going to give in again and buy more so I can stop this feeling but that fear is also pushing me to keep going. I don’t want to fail, I want to get better. I’ve tried to find support but I’m worried about going to meetings because I know not everybody is serious about sobriety and I don’t want to get dragged back into it. 

I’m in this for the long haul and truly inspired to never do this again. I was so scared I was going to die that I hope it’s enough to keep me from ever touching the stuff again.

\[""Several lines of evidence suggest that classic (5HT2A agonist) hallucinogens have clinically relevant effects in alcohol and drug addiction. Although recent studies have investigated the effects of psilocybin in various populations, there have been no studies on the efficacy of psilocybin for alcohol dependence. We conducted a single-group proof-of-concept study to quantify acute effects of psilocybin in alcohol-dependent participants and to provide preliminary outcome and safety data. Ten volunteers with DSM-IV alcohol dependence received orally administered psilocybin in one or two supervised sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement Therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Participants' responses to psilocybin were qualitatively similar to those described in other populations. Abstinence did not increase significantly in the first 4 weeks of treatment (when participants had not yet received psilocybin), but increased significantly following psilocybin administration (p < 0.05). Gains were largely maintained at follow-up to 36 weeks. The intensity of effects in the first psilocybin session (at week 4) strongly predicted change in drinking during weeks 5-8 (r = 0.76 to r = 0.89) and also predicted decreases in craving and increases in abstinence self-efficacy during week 5. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events. These preliminary findings provide a strong rationale for controlled trials with larger samples to investigate efficacy and mechanisms.""\]

I am seriously addicted to all sorts of media, especially using the internet on my phone. There is no such thing as a certain amount of usage hours that make you an official addict, but if it's preventing you from doing things you truly want to do and that makes you suffer, I guess you can name it addiction. I suppose you know the states of addiction. 

I definitely haven't had a healthy consumption of media for probably 6 years now - I way too often do duties shortly before the deadline (which causes a lot of unnecessary stress), I am not able to enjoy my hobbies anymore (if I even do those activities) because of this itchy feeling that I have to grab my phone, my mind is then constantly focused on that, I have a messed up sleep circle; when I go to school I get maybe 5/6 hours of sleep (at times less) , during the holidays when I have to work/have appointments/etc. I sometimes only get 4 hours, on the weekends (in order not to mess my schedule even more up) the same amount (=>I raaarely go to bed before 01 AM.),etc. etc.
the past few days I only got 2-4 hours of sleep and that's definitely not enough for me. It has been like this for years now and I can notice the impact of the chronic sleep deprivation on my physical and mental health as well as on my intellectual performance abilities.

(Just as an extra info; I mostly consume science podcasts, documentaries, I binge Wikipedia articles and similar things - so I only partially /rarely watch nonsense [I almost never use tiktok, Instagram, FB or so[ yes, of course it depends on what you consume there, but you get my point ig]]  - this makes it harder to stop because of all that interesting information - I crave it (dopamine boosts) (reading a book is too slow + bc of the addiction I can barely focus)) 

Soo... I am suffering from this over consumption and am therefore addicted.
I don't want to live a life in which I don't live my life, but stare at a screen for hours and hours... 


Are you addicted to the internet as well? Be honest to yourself.
Have you been addicted and were able to overcome it? How did you do that? Please let me know. 

And what I actually want to ask you; if you are addicted to the internet as well - would you like to be my ""recovery buddy""?

The smart, highly creative, wise side... and the crazy, self-destructive wild side. However these worlds are colliding and causing me a lot of issues as they have been for years.

I started smoking weed everyday around 14 bc it helped me feel not so lonely, as I've been an outcast all my life. But that escalated into me loving the way new drugs feel because the ""mind expansion"" creativity aspect of it. I feel they help relieve this constant feeling of depression and low self-esteem I naturally feel and allow me to make music more freely and have fun with my day to day life and have motivation.

I'm also ADHD so I love thrill seeking. I make music about really deep things in life, and things that reflect my dreams, morals, and personality. But in reality I keep destroying myself in order to maintain a sense of equilibrium.

Right now I'm trashed and I usually wouldn't have the motivation to write this because I feel like I always write a post on reddit but still feel hopeless for some reason. Still alone no matter who replys. Even when I've went to those rehabs or NA meetings. Still feeling like nothing helps despite how optimistic and positive mindset I keep about my life. Even though I constantly fall into hopelessness aswell; but knowing there is a light and a way out and I can do it.

But my daily actions always contradict myself. I always go crazy sober and I don't know what to do. I really don't. Feels like I've tried all options.

I take downers to let myself let my mental guards down.

Take stimulants to allow me to enter my happy plac.e

Smoke weed to enchance my creativity and thoughts

Hit this nicotine that has my heart racing every second of the day

Without these things I cannot enjoy even a second of being sober because I will just lay there in bed knowing what I have to do to make myself feel better but feeling litterally incapable of doing it.

I know it sounds like excuses, but my mind is really weighing me down like this.

I have some good things in life going for me which is so odd for my situation.

I just met a great girl who I can really relate to, she makes me excited about life again. And she dosen't do drugs and really has her shit together in life. But i've tried quitting drugs because I want to be sober and clear headed with her but still can't seem to do it. I'm more funnier, act like myself, feel content when I'm loaded, I don't know how to escape this cycle.

I also have a talent and love for music. But I've never made a song sober and it feels like all my creativity leans on being in a state of not overthinking or being too depressed to do anything.

But on the other hand, I quit my job. Then a week later got another job but got fired on the 3rd day because I didn't pick up fast enough. So I'm now 2 weeks without a job and barely clinging onto the last of my money blowing it on drugs, alcohol and whatever as much as it hurts and I still need money to pay the mechanic for fixing my car but now I'm definitely not going to have enough.

I'm my own worst enemy. Always screwing myself

I've been crying a lot lately. Feeling super emotional. I can only hold myself up with substances so long before I fall and start slipping.

I know what to do to get sober and be happy, but I still feel clueless as how to do it. Everytime I try to it just overwhelms me too much. The highs and rituals are too rooted. But I'm only 19.

When I turned 21 I became a borderline alcoholic, drinking every single day for months. I’m well into being 21 still and haven’t quite stopped, but I did chill out. I want to kick it ALL. I even snort my prescription drugs like adderall or my depression meds just to try to feel something without from it, but I never do, yet I still occasionally do it expecting different results. I need help. My long term therapist i’ve had since i was in high school terminated our sessions and me as a patient because of my apathy and poor improvement. 

I want to stop constantly wanting drugs, drinking and smoking. But when I do, I always turn back to masturbating. There’s always something I can never kick. I want to be healthy for once in my life, and I can’t start without figuring out what my constant struggle with general addiction is.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9842686653137207}"

Why?

Because often my mind will make me think I want something (in my case It’s usually to look at porn or eat junk food). To see if I really want to do it I imagine myself doing whatever it is I’m not supposed to be doing as realistically as possible.

After I imagine doing it I realize that I don’t like doing that kind of thing at all. Not only that, but I actually dislike it. It’s my mind that likes doing it not me. 

You are not a feeling. You are not a desire. These are exterior sensations. You can act on them if you wish, but why? Because these things aren’t you, they’re just things that you are feeing. So to give in would be to do something you don’t actually want to do. To believe that your mind is you. 

You have to remember who you are. You are not a brain. You are not a thought. You have a brain and you may create thoughts if you wish. You can use your brain but you shouldn’t identify with things that come out of it. Everything is temporary. A thought that came in goes away just as easily, almost as if it never existed as long as you don’t act on it. 

Don’t try to come up with reasons to not do something like it’s some forbidden thing that you really want to do but must never do it under any circumstances. You don’t actually want to give in, it just feels like you do. Stop looking at the consequences to prevent you from doing it and realize that you can do whatever it is that’s tempting you. But do you really want to? If you do decide to give into the temptation make sure to stay conscious during the entire thing, don’t just let the impulse control you. If it’s junk food then every time you move your arm to your mouth control the motion. Every bite make sure to chew it slowly and actually taste it. You’ll realize it’s not actually that good. Observe the sensations/ pleasure you get from it but don’t identify with any of the pleasure you feel.

Addictions are compulsive and the activity is mostly done unconsciously/ automatically (especially sex addiction). So if you ever for some reason can’t resist then at the very least make sure to control what you are doing and observe the sensations that arise. You’re addiction may not be binge eating, but the unconscious act of binge eating. 

This may not work with every addiction so be careful, but it doesn’t hurt to try. Just stay conscious while you’re trying out the technique.

You are whoever you want to be. You are the power to do things. All we can do is do or not do. That is the power we have in this life, so don’t lose the only power you have just to give the mind what it wants. Just to get a little bit of pleasure.",31,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9960238933563232}"

Because of this, I spoke to my doctor and decided to stop taking stimulant medication altogether. Consistent exercise, diet, etc seemed to help me stay independent from using meds, but I'd find myself craving the feeling of being on them at random. 

A couple of months back I started taking them again. I would get a few of the 30s and binge for a day or two, then give it a week or two before using them again. Around 4 weeks ago that turned into taking them more consistently. I wouldn't take them during the work day, but would when I got off to continue having energy for other things. This turned into a more consistent habit, and over the pastv month I've been getting 5 hours of sleep a night maximum. Now on the tail end of this bender, I have been taking anywhere from 60mg to 180mg a day, and I am really struggling to get back off of them. 

For example, today and yesterday I decieed to drop to 30mg in the morning and nothing the rest of the day to start slowly coming off of taking them. Figured I would ween down to 20ishmg, then 15, then 7.5, then nothing over a couple of weeks. Yesterday I was fine on 30mg, worked all day, trained at my grappling gym for a couple of hours after work, went to bed early. I woke up this morning so tired and groggy I couldn't even open my eyes. Even after taking a 30mg I was having trouble staying awake until I took another 30mg this afternoon. 

I'm wondering, is there anything I can take supplement wise that will help me stay awake enough to function while I taper off of the adderall? I currently take a multi, mood stabilizer, 5-htp, L-Tyrosine, chelated magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12. Anything else that may help? I want to break this cycle before it continues to get worse, but I don't recall ever feeling this fatigued before. Any thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated.

However, my reduction plan was 3 months long (likely far too short for my liking and thats serious me saying that.. But all hail the UK government and taxes!) and I'm right at the end now!! All the way down to 0.4mg for a week or so... And done!

Let me tell you... With a good mindset (which I believe I had for this) I genuinely barely felt the reductions each week... I was soo keen to do this and do it right that getting down from 6mg (having reduced from more in the past, I've just been settled on 6mg for a year or so) to 0.4mg in a fairly short amount of time made it seem like such a smooth ride, that shocked me atleast once a week! I'm not sure that's all of the answer.. But here I am..

However, the big ass 'but' in this story is how the last 3 months have pulled me into a false sense of security.. I genuinely believed when I hopped off 0.4mg, it would be like any other drop as normal... Oh boy, I was so wrong! Right into full withdrawal! Its the aches and cramps that do me the most, and then because of them the insomnia! It's crazy uncomfortable... But I have had the whole list so far, which I can manage any day... But these pesky muscles and body in general have been absolute nobs that need a stern talking to! 

I lost the plot the first night of a full day with no bupe.. About 4am I broke down (full of sleeping pills that wouldn't work and I won't even go into the rest) crying, that ""I couldn't do this""... My partner (bless her so much) coached me for 15mins or so, even though I had awoken her and I had another 0.4mg.. I didn't want to, but I did.. All at the same time. It was awful and a completely unexpected scenario.. I haven't had any withdrawals in atleast 2.5 years, so it was a massive shock, I wasn't prepared for. 

I am now though, 38.5 hours in from my last dose... If I can get past the 48 hour mark, I will be so unbelievably happy... 

My withdrawals don't appear to be as bad this evening, but I'm still writing this instead of sleeping, while many others are snoring! Aha! However, I know I can do this... Some sleepless nights and pains are probably the least of the penance I must make.. But I'm strong this time, I gathered support and I'm doing it no matter what it takes. For me and my life. For my family and my future family, I don't want to be anywhere near this when we finally conceive... I don't care how hard it gets, this shit is getting done.

Let me start off first and foremost and say, I am an addict. I have been chasing addictions for as long as I have known – if not longer than I have known. I have struggled ALL my life with some sort of addiction since the pre-teen years (I am mid 35 currently.). Let me start off with I was diagnosed Bipolar 1 Disorder in my early teens, and also hospitalized many times. Severe Anxiety, Bipolar Depression, OCD, ADD – Inattentive Type, and PTSD. 

I went back to being medicated almost 5 years ago this month. I take my lithium daily, along with my anti-anxiety meds as needed, sleep meds, PTSD (night terrors/nightmare medication, ADD meds, and other medications along with it. I have been compliant for the most part with my medications. There are weeks that I will take double or triple the dose of Lithium just to get that Euphoric High feeling. But my moods are pretty much stabilized with the lithium and latuda that I take daily. I have abused my anti-anxiety meds (Xanax) on a regular basis and continue to do so. I have also abused my Adderall on a regular basis and continue to do so. On top of all of this, I am very much a binge drinking alcoholic. I usually drink after a certain time each day, I am very much functioning overall. I’ve reached out for help; my doctor has given me naltrexone. I don’t care for it, so I won’t take it. I have tried to go to AA meetings, not really my style so there’s that also. 

I have a severe trauma history, severe ptsd, bipolar/bipolar depression, (not making excuses) and such …. Which affect me on a regular daily basis. I have been in consistent therapy for over 3 years now. I feel like I have made some head way, but not as much as I would have liked. My partner/husband makes frugal effort in taking care of my mental and physical well being as I have some other debilitating health conditions that keep me down also. But overall, he tries to navigate my mental health. Which I appreciate very much. Most days I just smile and continue my day. Somedays I get irritated and don’t want to be bothered with, other days I wanted to be snuggled and loved. Then there are days I just want to feel like a bottomless pit! Despite all of the “conditions” – I am very much an addict. I am addicted to prescription medication that I very much need to function. But instead, I will abuse it for so long then do without until the next fill, and I’ve done this a lot over the past year or so. I’m pretty sure my partner knows, but he mostly knows what I tell him and that’s that. But really, I struggle. I’ve told my Psychiatrist of my struggles and she doesn’t believe me that I could do that and there is no way that is possible. I am a hardcore Fake it until you make it kind of person. 

Faking it until it’s gotten better or is better is my thing and others honestly. But I am able to fully mask everything else I am dealing with … in order to fool others I am feeling “A” okay. In Which I do A LOT more than I would like to admit truly. Honestly, I don’t even know why I am making this post. But I felt I needed some sort of platform to speak my mind and feelings truly. I guess I was hoping I would get less judgement here, but I am sure I will get more judgmental eyeballs my way than I want or expected. I know a lot of this is because of my bipolar disorder. Trust me I’ve tried to lie to myself and say it’s all in my head, but it’s really not. It’s sadly apart of me and I can’t get rid of it no matter how hard I try. I am constantly losing pieces of me. With each manic episode which I hide as much as I can, or my partner just contributes it to medication abuse …. I literally lose parts of me. I suffer, I get deeply consumed in brain overdrive …. Then I eventually crash into deep depression that is so hard to dig out of, that I just want to just end it all. What’s hurts the most is being so close and having so much to say. I never know if I can follow through. Honestly, I don’t believe in taking your own life, I feel it’s selfish and just puts burden on top of tons of pain/suffering off to your loved ones. Sometimes I think it would be easier than being an addict who suffers from mental health issues/other health issues – that being gone would fix it all. Would it really make it better? It might. But I’ll never know, because I continue to fake it until I make it per say. 

In a nutshell, I am an addict, and I am suffering more than the people around me realize. I don’t know how to control everything as I thought I could do or as if I did before. The struggles are worsening. In the past I was known for not paying bills or forgetting to pay important invoices, but I have gotten better at that, and those tasks are done every month like clockwork.   Instead, I continue to lie to myself and the others around me about my well being and addictions. I attach my self to simple to moderate tasks and prefer them to be a certain way just to feel comfort. Hell, I have watched the show “The 100” 7 times – all of the seasons in the past year. I find something comfortable, and I attach to it. 

I think I just really came here to get some things off my chest and fully admit I am in an extremely bad place, in which I am having a hard time digging my self out of. But again, Hi…. I am an addict and struggling. Please be kind… or try to be.",2,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8725330829620361}"

The real pain of being an addict is letting people down that you care about and the mental health woes associated with constantly disappointing them. It’s finding the perfect romantic partner then watching them walk away, not because they don’t like you or think your a good person, but because they can’t deal with the instability that comes with your addiction. At the same time though you actually understand why their leaving and you don’t hold any resentment towards them for it. I mean, who can blame them? 
It’s also getting a new job, then getting recognized for great achievements, going above and beyond, etc… then slowly, over time, having everyone who sang your praises just ready to see you go because your dependability sucks. 

It’s looking at your future and seeing the prospect of just riding the 101 from San Fran to Santa Rosa in an endless loop as the most peaceful future possible for you because at least this way no one gets disappointed, disillusioned, or let down. An eternity where I can be alone with all the good memories of when things were good  with those special people who gave me a chance before I went and let them down.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.6727641820907593}"

I get addicted to stuff, but I'm lucky, I guess, because I eventually get sick of it and quit for good (usually with a few temporary relapses, but for good in time). I'm hoping I'm sick enough of the current addictions to get over it.

I'm going to date myself with this, but I quit nicotine over 30 years ago. Never missed it after that. Lucky I guess, or REALLY fed up. This was the toughest thing to quit because I felt sick for weeks and messed up for one month. I quit drinking, cold turkey, over 15 years ago. Again, lucky I guess, I never missed if after that, well, just a bit in the sense of ""It would be nice to taste this wonderful drink"", but not obsessing over it all the time. Of course, I adjusted my lifestyle accordingly and it helped.

I'm getting to the current day. To some, what I'll say will sound like it's nothing at all, but every day I end up feeling sick to my stomach and overtired from lack of sleep because of coffee and eating large snacks before bed. To me, it's not ""Oh, stop whining. This is a typical North American disease and it doesn't compare to being addicted to \[insert your drug of choice\]"". No. Every day, I feel sick some of the time, go to bed with a sore stomach, and don't sleep, and it's ruining my life. So, yeah, big consequences. (In case you're wondering, I've always had a weak stomach, plus I'm waiting for exams to make sure it hasn't developed into something worse. But basically, it's mostly me having to be smarter about eating and drinking coffee.

So, maybe I'm getting sick enough of it to take control. I've quit coffee once, a long time ago, and that wasn't too bad. As for the snacking, I could stop or use snacking at night some of the strategies like eating small healthy snacks instead of binging on cheese. 

The scariest thing is that as I'm harming myself with the coffee and the snacks, I see the exact same mechanism at play than when I used to smoke or drink. And it's currently bad because when it comes time to get the other coffee or chunk of cheese, I tell myself ""Screw it. I'm doing it"". And the consequences are almost immediate: I go to bed with borderline nausea every day. Those urges are so powerful.

This was a bit long. I'll end by saying I'm still glad it's not something else much worse, but still it is greatly reducing my quality of life.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9491324424743652}"
2021-08-23 08:43:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/p9z1nv/why_i_nearly_died_from_alcohol/,Why I Nearly Died From Alcohol," Here is my story:

&#x200B;

It is coming together as a big picture. 

It all start a year ago when my father threatened to murder me on a military base in Ontario, near the capital region of Canada where I was living at the time. Or maybe the story starts with the war in Afghanistan, or 9/11 because I swear my life has been fucked up ever since that day. 

 My father told me he would slit my throat and that he had killed 17 people and would kill me too, would not hesitate, and is very good at it. I hid in my room for two days then forced him to drive me back to the city where I lived and never saw him again. A few weeks later I went to my home city because my sister was getting married and started reaching out to family members for support and action. Every single person silenced me. My grandfather instructed me to stay silent to protect my father, my sister told me if I had a problem I could leave forever. My uncle told me it is normal for a man to act that way, my aunt did nothing, and manipulated me into getting over it. A cousin would stay dead silent everytime I spoke about it. Anytime I spoke about it people would talk about putting me in a psychiatric facility.

 7 ish months ago I finally called the Military Police. They intimidated me, told me I could not give a statement, and sent me to a police department they knew would not help. I tried my local police, they said they were sending officers to interview me, they never showed up, never called, were supposed to call. I gave up for a long time. A week or so ago I decided to start speaking out against the family members who silenced me and told them if they did admit to the coverup and help me find support and take action I would go to the police. They started calling the police on me every time I spoke about the abuse, the coverup, and telling them I was a danger to myself and crazy and attempted to intimidate me, silence me, delegitimize me, and confine me to a psych ward. But the police started believing me immediately and the next day I filed a full police report. They called the police on me again, told my story for the 6th or 7th time and convinced them I wasn't crazy. Later that night the police call, tell me It's all over, there will be no investigation.

So I call another department. They refuse to help. So I call the FIRST department, military police where I had started and they take me seriously STRAIGHT AWAY. I have an active case number. My family told me I'm crazy, that they never were going to stand up for me and I belong in a mental hospital and then all blocked me. Everyone. Aunt uncle sister cousins grandparents ALLL GONE. But I have an active police investigation and an independent journalist who is interested in my story.

 I have contacted all three major Canadian news stations but have not yet heard back. My father is a veteran of the war in Afghanistan and he has PTSD and is unstable and is dangerous to himself and the public. I have seen him threaten people in public so many times. they did NOT protect the public.

 I told my family I will not stop speaking out against the way they coverup child abuse. We have a family history related to this: My mother's father murder her mother and committed suicide in front of his children and they REFUSE to take this seriously. Infact my uncle, her brother told me it is totally normal for a man to threaten to do that to his family. 

So I am returning to the capital in one week and beginning to fight a lengthy legal and media campaign against my father, My entire extended family network on both sides, my police, federal government, and military. I will attempt to organize with other discarded veterans and military families in the capital. I lost my job due to stress. I am now penniless. Nothing left in the world, but someone has offered me a place to stay and i had travel points saved on my card.

At one point I became so hopeless I am almost drank myself to death and wound up in a detox centre. Which ended up being a great thing because as of last week I am 4 months sober.

I am terrified of being black flagged for ADHD medication. I am not currently prescribed it but I now have a decent job with good health benefits. I am considering visiting with a psychiatrist in tandem with a   CBT therapist because I want to do well and keep this job and honestly move up in it, I have a VERY REAL possibility of actually getting promoted and having longevity with this company. 

1.) Has anyone tried Provigil/Nuvigil medications and do they ever cause you to have craving behavior?
2.) I want to approach them about a psych evaluation to see if I am even treating the right condition first.
3.) How do you handle your craving thoughts and urges? I know when I am in the thick of it I blow my money and end up searching for alternatives which are how I found Provigil/Nuvigil.
4.) Is it depression or anxiety that causes your cravings? Feelings of hopelessness? Lack of control? L.o.C. is my biggest trigger for using. I want my attention and my time to be how I want to be which is productive and successful.
5.) I want to tell this psychiatrist I struggle with addiction. Primarily stimulants (Nicotine, Caffeine, stimulant medication, and just recently cocaine). But I am afraid they will only see my thought process and curiosity as drug-seeking and bar me from the medication I see the most benefit from. I have tried Wellbutrin and Strattera as well but they just come with too many side effects and honestly hinders me more because I feel awful and flush all the time. 
6.) Are there medication options that manage compulsive behavior or cravings? I honestly DO NOT ENJOY abusing these drugs, I just want to be able to fucking focus on something for more than 3 weeks and going back to having a healthy routine and lifestyle. I like who I am on the medication, I want to be goal and efficiency-oriented. 
7.) Am I just trying to come up with justifications to feed the beast? I have gone to rehab, I have done the therapy and the time. That addiction thought process will convince you that you NEED it in your life.

Feel free to just answer one of these or all. I would just really appreciate some advice about this because I do not want to go down that rabbit hole again but I am also so tired of being easily distracted, depressed, and lethargic.

I like dying when I can't feel and see it happening. Ideally I don't want to have to choose between the two. I want to recover from both. But it seems like when I'm not an alcoholic, I'm a bulimic, and when I'm not a bulimic, I'm alcoholic. Would dying slowly be better? I've got 20 days of sobriety under my belt and I don't know if I want to throw that all away. But I miss the feeling of being drunk, I didn't have to think about all the painful stuff that I just want to bury as deep as possible. Idk.

2021-08-22 08:24:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/p9bjxr/still_an_alcoholic/,Still an alcoholic.,"At 21 years old I admitted to myself that I was powerless over alcohol and my life had become unmanageable. It was time to embark on my journey of sobriety if I wanted to live. I did. It lasted the better part of 20 years. Until it didn’t. 

My relapse began in my early 40’s and lasted almost 4 years. 😞 I have now been gratefully sober for a little over 2 years. I’m 48 years old. 

That 4ish? year relapse almost killed me, and definitely killed every important relationship I had. This is what happens when an alcoholic is active in their addiction. Nothing and no one is sacred or protected from the consequences of their choices.

I fight daily to have half of the strength my disease does. (Yes, it’s a disease) The almost 20 years of sobriety I had were no match for my alcoholic make up, even with all of that time and knowledge of my issues under my belt. I talked myself into the insanity and made the choice to drink. 😞 My disease was far worse than it was in my 20s almost immediately. 😞

I’m STILL trying to rebuild all that I lost. I share my struggles and victories publicly today because I fell flat on my face publicly - I want the world to see that I’m trying, I’m working, I’m doing everything I can to just do the next right thing - and this shit is HARD!!!! 
Trying to repair broken trust and build new foundations in to old relationships that have been tarnished, is fucking hard! But, I wake up each day determined to keep doing the next right thing, and no matter what, I don’t take a drink. When life gets too lifey, I now have healthy tools and resources to utilize, that get me through the moment.

I am Michelle. I’m a wife, a daughter, a sister and a mother and I’m an alcoholic in recovery, recovering publicly and loudly for all to hear and see in hopes of saving one person from having to go through some of this shit, or of helping someone who’s currently in it. You can do this!

All of this is shared with love. I always hope my words help someone, but ultimately I am the one who benefits the most from sharing my experience, strength and hope. 
For that I am so very grateful.",27,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8113301992416382}"

I eventually went on 16mg suboxone per day and after a few weeks had to switch to Subutex, at the Dr.'s insistence. She thought I was having a reaction and was at risk for anaphylactic shock (i disagreed). Anyways, it has been a nightmare since then. My regular pharmacy and every other one in town not only refused to fill it, but treated me like I was up to something or using them to get high. I went a whole week in horrible withdrawal, until the Dr was able to convince a local pharmacy to agree to fill it.  That was about 6 weeks ago. Since then, I have taken it as prescribed, with the exception of usually filling it one day late, because I usually forget to take my nighttime dose 1-2 times per week.  Last week the Dr talked me into increase the dose and adding one  2mg tablet per day (prN) She felt the physical pain and irritability were due to withdrawal not Lupus (I have severe SEL).  This week would have been the first week at that dose. She warned me the insurance may make it difficult and said she scripted the 2mg separate, incase  I had to pay for it. AT least I would only have to pay for the 2mg.

Imagine my horror and embarrassment  when I picked it up yesterday and the tech told me the pharmacist said this was the last time he was filling my script and he could only give me the 8mgx2, because they don't carry the 2mg. I was upset that they didn't call to tell me that and embarassed to once again be treated like a junky.  The pharmacist wasn't there and the tech said She didn't know why he would not fill it . But he wrote me a note on my bag saying what I put in the subject line of this post.

&#x200B;

SO here I am freaked out. Scared of withdrawals and going back to drugs.  I honestly wish I would have never agreed to MAT. I have 14 8mg left and am going to try to make them last a few weeks, rather than take them as prescribed and be in horrible withdrawal in 7 days. I  was so happy to finally be away from the dope.  Aside from using Coke 2 times since May, I have been completely clean. I was going t ask the pharmacist why, but my anonymity is to important to risk it by going inside and having someone overhear it. Nobody knows I am an addict.

I would like to know why thought. I am afraid and angry. I can't go back to dope and I don't know what to do.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993195533752441}"

it showed me not to glorify drugs or use them as a means of escape in the harshest way possible, i hate acid now even though i kinda love it,but id still do it again and make the same stupid mistakes! while id be lying if i said it was a better me now or if i said im functioning better, but im clean. dont even smoke weed, the most i do now is caffeine.

im proud. wont touch any psychs again out of fear, i wont touch any pills again out of the bitter lesson i learned. i always thought the ""your worst day sober is better then your best day high"" was bullshit. because it is, but my soul is finally at rest knowing i dont need any substances . i can be happy on my own because its my happiness not a drugs.",7,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.952258288860321}"
2021-08-22 03:39:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/p98bt5/feeling_weird_after_a_trip_please_help/,Feeling weird after a trip. Please help :(,"Hey everyone! 


I had a weird trip last night that’s left me feeling sad and confused. I’m hoping to get some reassurance/stories of similar experiences/advice/information. Sorry if this is long:


Last night was my 2nd time doing acid. I did it just in my room with my boyfriend trip sitting. I did a tab (I’m not sure of the ug but it felt very strong), 2 small chocolate edibles and an md cap (I’m also not sure of the quantities here, sorry). 


I have quite bad depression and anxiety and have for some years as well as a few more mental health issues. I have been getting a lot of suicidal thoughts in the past month and feel like my mental health is at an all time low. I’ve experienced a lot of loss this year and it’s left me feeling very empty. I drove myself to the hospital to beg to be admitted to the psych ward this week but couldn’t bring myself to leave the car. 


I have done a considerable amount of drugs in the past few months. It’s not been something I’ve ever really been into until this year. I’ve done mostly edibles and whippits/nangs. I’ll admit I might go a bit overboard with the nangs- usually once or twice a fortnight and 25-60 per session. Then there’s been a bit of jungle juice/amyl nitrate, md and lyrica here and there. I understand that I likely have a drug dependence and it’s been a point of tension between me and loved ones recently. I have tripped on shrooms about 7 times in the last 3.5 months. The last 3 trips I had went bad and were from 5, 6 and 6.5G. 


These bad trips were quite scary. I managed to convince myself I had hallucinated my whole life and I felt like I was experiencing all the sadness felt by everyone in history, like I was all these different people and going through such heavy dark sadness through the lens of their experience. I couldn’t figure out who I was.  I fully believed that whoever I was, I had brain cancer (which I do not). It was awful, confusing and I think it was probably a self destructive decision to continue to take psychedelics after all these bad trips. I also felt quite physically dysfunctional after these. It was like my brain and body weren’t connected and when I would try to lift my arm or move my leg I simply couldn’t. I didn’t feel in control of my body. I felt paralysed. 


In my trip last night I filmed myself and my boyfriend having a conversation because in my head I had this million dollar epiphany which I was trying to explain to him and couldn’t lose. But watching the videos back it was just strings of words that made no sense and me repeating the same weird things that I can best think to describe as subconscious babbling. 


It’s freaking me out quite a lot. In my head I make perfect sense. I don’t understand what was going on and I feel like i’ve gone crazy. I’m scared I am a freak or outcast and that anyone who watched it would consider me insane and be scared of me. 


I feel quite sad and confused. My brain doesn’t feel like it’s thinking right but I don’t know how to articulate it. I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve done something terrible and that everyone is upset at me and scared of me despite getting plenty of reassurance that this is not the case. I just feel strange and bad and I really want it to go away. 


Is there something wrong with me? Am I insane? Is this normal at all? Will it ever stop? 


Why was I saying gibberish? Does this symbolise anything? Why does acid even have the effect it does? Is the stuff I see real and just me accessing another dimension/timeline? I have never been a religious person but I can’t comprehend how or what anyone of it means. I’m hoping it’s normal because I feel worried that I have lost my mind and for some reason this feels like the most shameful, isolating, uncertain thing ever.

I've always been pretty controlled with coke, didn't use much and I guess it would be the same now, one hit and thn gtfo out before you lose control.

Also, I get a really weird sense of dread & a knot in my stomach whenever I'm on my way to get some, and I'm so scared of the ""comedown"" every time.

It's just not worth it but I wanna feel it again, I wanna have this weird chemical smell/taste again, the ringing, the warm summer air, so many good, macabre memories.

Longtime lurker here. My fiancé is going to detox soon for a bad opiate addiction. He is allergic to buprenorphine and this facility doesn’t do methadone tapers. The salesmen on the phone are saying that they give oxycodone / other opiates out if a client is allergic to buprenorphine. He asked if he could have a nurse or doctor call back, at whatever time (at their convenience) to explain how this would work because he’s worried he’s going to get there and find out all they do is buprenorphine. It’s a 7 hour trip away on a bus so we are a bit scared to put him on a bus and just hope the salesmen are telling the truth.

The last facility he went to, he expressed these concerns and a nurse called him back and told him what the facility did (in that case it was methadone so he was fine). 

These salesmen are acting like it’s the biggest fuckin sin in the world to “ask” a staff member to tell us what we are getting into and just keep telling us to “relax” and “it’s a good place”. When he withdraws, it’s BAD. Like, we are talking “kidney damage from super high BP / seizures” bad, and it’s making us panic that they can’t have a nurse or doc just give us a 2 minute call to state “our facility does have a plan in place for him due to his allergy”.

The two days before he passed we were together was a great day but he was short on cash and asked if I could front him some Xanax to sell until his check arrived and ofcourse I did.. the night he passed he was trying to call me to hang out but I was at work until 11. Apparently he went to another friends house messed up off the bars he was supposed to sell and the kid he was with that night gave him methadone and that was the fatal mix. I loved him so much man. After he passed I made  a promise to my self to cut the shit out for good and make him proud but the guilt and shame is just destroying me. I was doing good for a few weeks but I cant handle the sickening amount of guilt and shame I feel when I realize if I just didn't give those to him he would still be here. Im trying so hard to hold on for him but here I am smoking crack and taking Xanax. I feel like the biggest scum bag in the world.

The norm used to be this: A positive test or arrest for hard drugs meant you were sent to a substance abuse counselor, who announced that you have a drug problem and need treatment.

Or, at minimum, that an assessment would take place to make that determination -- and part of that would come from monitoring your *receptiveness* to drug education you were ordered to receive.

Times are changing; more and more people push for this: Nov. 2020: [NPR: From Marijuana To Mushrooms, Voters Want Drug Laws Eased](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/04/931507602/from-marijuana-to-mushrooms-voters-want-drug-laws-eased). Those two are so-called soft drugs, but  advocacy  for hard drugs is following. Drug policy reformer and [author Carl Hart](https://old.reddit.com/r/publichealth/comments/ls2l9v/discussion_university_professor_suggests_70_of/), who discusses his heroin use, is one such commentator. Hart convincingly argues that about 70% of hard drug users are not addicts. (FN) In [a 2021 interview with Joe Rogan,](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4xMbq7gLEjFioOQ5gpSw2l) speaking of hard drugs, Hart also says:

>""You should fight for your right, your liberty to use drugs."" @ 22:40

This subversive comment seems to be widely appreciated. Many recreational hard drug users today tell counselors in police drug diversion programs to take a hike. And similarly dismiss counselors under the *Counseling-Rehab-Model* -- which has been widely been promoted as a replacement for ending the War on Drugs. Some addicts deny that they are addicts, deny that they have a problem, and are similarly defiant about their right to use drugs.

Interesting thing: 20 years ago, most drug policy reformers--architects of the Counseling-Rehab Model--would have denounced Hart's comment.

>""We do not support recreational use of hard drugs.  We council against it. We believe the Counseling-Rehab Model can address America drug problems.  Having law enforcement threaten and sanction any users is inappropriate.""

Today -- quite the change. Seems there is more tolerance for hard drugs from the very people who are supposed to council against it. Often it is a *wink, wink* thing. *Counselor:*  ""I advise that you stop using cocaine recreationally. I hope you don't get sent to me again.""  If the War on Drugs is phased out, is the Counseling-Rehab-Model going to suppress any appreciable amount of recreational drug use in America?

= = =

FN: This is a  ballpark figure; the better analysis would peg hard drug users on a continuum; example: 1) 30% - use without problem; 2) 40% - use with no major issues, but some impacts occur, e.g., use hinders high-level economic achievement, 3) 15% addicted.  Functional but can't hold a full-time job over time; 4) 15% addicted and debilitated; hardcore alcoholics and chronic heroin injectors are examples.  Figures would vary for each drug, e.g.: heroin vs. meth vs. powder cocaine. Complicating further: the common practice of many users to use multiple drugs.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9822818040847778}"

So I did heroin for a while when I was a teenager. It was probably about 10 years ago, and I did it on a daily basis for about 2 months. Then I just walked away and never looked back. Or at least I thought.

I probably always still thought about it from time to time. Never considering actually doing it, but just remembering it. It’s like, we’re all just trying to feel good organically by uhhhhh….trying to make our fucking lives be actually good? (What a concept) but heroin is this cheat code where you can just chemically induce you’re self into a state of just not giving a single flying fuck even if nothing is fine. 

So for the past few weeks I’ve had this strange experience after all these years where I intensely craved opiates. At first just sort of using my imagination to play pretend drug addict, and then in classic form just moving that line a little bit at a time till before I knew it I’d turned something on in me that I started to feel I couldn’t turn off. It’s amazing how crafty you get when you want drugs. I went from wishing upon a star that pills would fall out of the sky into my lap, to actually having several different viable plans of action of how I was actually gonna get them. As the days have gone on I’ve gone more and more into drug addict mode. Staring at my phone waiting or a text, doing nothing from sun up to sun down but obsessing over drugs. I kept telling myself to stop but I kept not stopping. 

Finally I decided I’d buy them on the dark web. I told myself that actually doing the drug was the only way to stop the craving. CAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE AND WORKS EVERYTIME HAHA *twitches*

This part is sad. So just as I’d made up my mind about buying the drugs and I was feeling the peaceful happy feeling, my roommate gets a phone call. A Friend of ours is dead from coke overdose. Of all the times. Well so that really snapped me out of it. I managed to not do any drugs, but not for a lack of effort.

My boyfriend and I live together, and he told me today that he’s addicted. He took some that I had from a previous car accident and has been buying them from one of his friends for 9 months. He has terrible anxiety and said it was the only thing that made him feel normal. I haven’t been through this before, and I want to support him in getting better. His job will fire him if he went to rehab, so we are going to try detoxing at home first. Please give me some advice and what to expect.

it used to be so simple, only ever socially using hard drugs but having suffered a lot of trauma and having an addict in my family, i shoulda known i was prone to this. i been diagnosed panic disorder but they never offered anything that actually worked due to me smoking weed (avoided lots of medications) my panic attacks  got so hard to control i had to start self medicated and got heavily addicted to xanax for months, snorting (ik) and popping them all day. went cold turkey and was hospitalized but then went clean for months


I thought i did it but then i had another episode and i thought just .5 won’t mean i relapsed right it’s jus to calm me down (didn’t realize i was going down the path of self medicating again) and from there it progressed. I can’t stop, every time i’m stressed out or have a problem sometbing as little as a headache my first thought is would my xanax help? 

I kept a schedule when i started reusing to make sure i wouldn’t get addicted but that got forgotten about in only 2 months when i stopped spacing out the days i used and turned to everyday again. 

I wanna be better for my family and for my girlfriend but im down to 3 bars and no connections no nothing. I have no option to taper myself off anymore i’ll just have to go cold turkey again, the only thing that sucks this time is that nobody knows.

I am new to this subreddit and I just want to know if this it the right subreddit or if you recommend any other for me? 
Ive been in a relationship with my current boyfriend (28yo) for almost 3 years. The past 2 years have been extremely tough on me, between Covid-19, being in a foreign country and what I thought it was me the problem that was causing my bf to ignore me. It got to a point that I’ve been going to a psychiatrist and I am officially severely depressed and about to start taking medication. 
He has never been a social person or wants to go outside so much but it’s been getting worse, always calls me selfish or thinks I’m being selfish for inviting him to go to a bar with my friends or asking if we could go and watch a movie! Last week he freaked out about a trip we made that he didn’t want to go, but ended up going to “make me happy” and just ruined the trip to me and his family and asked to leave a day earlier. He kept saying how selfish I was. He doesn’t want to commit to anything. He just wants to do his own thing which is laying down in bed, eat, sleep, repeat. Since I’ve met him he smokes weed and I had a problem with it in the beginning because it’s not common in my culture or very popular from were I am from. But eventually I got over it.
After the trip, I was just afraid and a little bit of grossed out of his attitude and reaction towards everyone, so I had a conversation with him and told him that I was going to move out. Then it’s when he started to admit that he needs help that he is addicted to weed and he couldn’t see how much this affected my mental health and self esteem. I’ve been reading about people with weed addiction and sounds like I’m living with one (which I had no idea) I guess my question is, because he wants to improve and quit. What can I do to help and would it get better? Or should I just leave and make him deal with it on his own? I am terrified that whenever he craves weed I’ll be the one who gets the blame for.

Just to clarify: he was the one that told me he had a problem which I was super oblivious about. I never asked him to quit or conditioned him of me leaving if he doesn’t quit. He brought this up",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993886947631836}"

Mostly fast food. I don't know why. I was so healthy in highschool. About 170 pounds, swimming competitively and eating good food to nourish myself. Now I'm 270 pounds, I live on my own and I haven't swam consistently in years.

I feel out of control. Like I have absolutely no choice but to just order or eat out. I hide it from my roommate and friends and eat in secret because I'm ashamed of it. It's ruining my life. I'm consistently gaining weight. It's ruining my finances. My car just died and I've been working overtime to replace it but I'm struggling so hard to save because all my money dissapears to apps like doordash or just fast food in general. 

Lately I've been better about meal prepping chicken,  rice and boiled vegetables. I'll make enough for all my days of work but even after I eat those meals, I still feel hungry and crave fast food. 

I fucking hate myself every time I give in. My self esteem has slowly been crushed every time I weigh myself. I'm unable to meet girls. I'm unable to be happy. Even my career has been put on hold because it requires me to be physically fit enough to pass a PT test. 

My life is being consumed and ruined by this addiction. I'm still young and it isn't too late to turn back, but I need advice before it becomes way out of hand. 

Some things I've tried: 

- Meal prepping
- Changing jobs to adjust my schedule 
- Sleeping better and more consistently
- Getting a health coach on the Vida app
- Meal planning
- Deleting food apps and changing driving routes to work to avoid restaurants.
- Carrying a large water bottle with me to avoid drinking soda (this one has worked well for me. It's mostly just food I struggle with.)

To summarize my story a bit, since March of this year I have been battling an addiction that I had had for 8 years.  Previously I had some seasons in which I tried to overcome my problem but being for superficial reasons (I did not see that as a real problem), I only lasted less than 10 days sober, but it was in March when I began to realize the seriousness of that , and since then I have been struggling to overcome my addiction, a fight in which my streaks lasted an average of a week.

Until, together with my struggle, I also faced the memory of things from the past that made me hate myself to the point that I began to hit myself, at first with simple slaps, but with the passage of time I began to hit myself squarely, especially my abdomen, it was At the end of May I felt some stability in my struggle with my addiction but it was out of self-hatred that made me unload my stress, get distracted and distract myself.  find a ""new source of satisfaction.""

In the first week of May I had a very strong episode of depression when remembering the past abuse I suffered, which, although it distracted me even more from that, also made me more sensitive to stress, that coincided with the fact that my girlfriend also started having an episode of depression 2 days after mine started.

After recovering from that depressive season, my girlfriend's depression was now, which brought me a lot of stress, and since I was still too sensitive, I ended up relapsing, lasting 3 weeks sober.

Although at that time I saw that time as a failure, now I see it as an achievement, because since then I returned to seasons where it did not last more than 2 weeks well.

I tell you this story mainly to vent because currently I have been quite repressed when it comes to venting

Practicing mindfulness is the one thing I can do that has a clear inverse affect on the amount of addictive behaviors I exhibit. This is huge for me because the hardest thing I find about abstinence is that I’m effectively “doing it” at all times.

Apologies for the wall of text. 

Background:
My (22M) girlfriend (22F) has been prescribed Adderall and Vyvanse since she was a kid, but she began abusing it at the onset of the pandemic. During quarantine, with nothing else to do, she began taking an excessive amount of pills and spending hours organizing, rearranging, painting etc. I’m not sure exactly how much she was taking, but I think it would probably be around 5-10 50mg Vyvanse and a couple 5mg Adderall per day. We were college students, so we were not physically together during this time, so I had no idea this was happening. 

Later, this past winter, she admitted to me that she had been abusing her prescription. She did not give specific numbers in terms of usage, and I have never taken adderall or anything before, so I didn’t understand the gravity of the situation. I figured that she was taking pills for fun from time to time and not let using them strictly as prescribed, which I didn’t think was great, but I wasn’t incredibly concerned. 

Finally, at the beginning of this summer I realized how serious of a problem this had become. She admitted one day that she had taken 10+ 50mg Vyvanse the night before, and I knew then that it was a major issue. She had been home following our graduation, and her parents threatened to send her to rehab after they realized she had stolen dozens of pills from their own bottles. 

Recently, we have been together and I have been holding the pills and dispensing them for her. But she has stolen them on multiple occasions then lied to me. She went into my bag and binged, then replaced the pills with supplements she had found that looked similar. She also switched doctors behind my back, got a new prescription, took 5 pills, then resealed the packaging to look like it was new. Most recently, she cut open with scissors a backpack that I had padlocked shut. 

Efforts to Stop Abuse
She recognizes that she has a problem, and knows that she needs to get the situation under control. She is adamant that she needs help and can’t control herself on her own. She generally feels regret and remorse after she binges, and knows it’s not good. 

Since her problem is binging, she has mainly attempted to give her pills to other people to dispense appropriately. She gave them to a roommate while at school, her mom when home, and now me after moving to a new city. This works, she is fine without them, but she will attempt to find them and access them whenever possible. She has also been seeing a therapist to understand the deeper causes of the abuse. After the most recent binge, she ordered the safe to keep herself from breaking into it.

She also doesn’t feel that she can quit entirely. She does have somewhat significant ADHD, and just started a new corporate job which requires focus. 

Unfortunately, she keeps getting into the pills in increasingly creative ways. I feel completely defeated and hopeless. I am worried about her health (her doctor said her liver isn’t healthy) and hurt by her dishonesty. I have told her if she keeps doing this I am going to break up with her, but then she does it again and I can’t bring myself to do it over something that seems so fixable. It breaks my heart to see her struggling like this and also that she consistently lies and goes behind my back. I just don’t know what to do. I love her, and I just want to help her figure this out. 

If anyone has any experience with a situation like this I would really appreciate any advice or strategies. Also, since I have never taken stimulants before, I want to know what she’s thinking, because I just cannot understand it. Thanks. 

Also, please ask questions I will respond to comments, I’m sure there are useful details to this that I left out.

I’ve never had too much trouble taking short tolerance breaks, but I haven’t taken one in about 9 months. I recently tried to quit smoking for good, along with a handful of other addictive substance and behaviors. I’ve been pretty successful so far with my other addictions. I’m coming up on a month dry, but weed is different. 

I’d only gone about 24 hours without smoking when I started to get really sweaty and shaky. Basically felt like I’d shotgunned a whole pot of coffee and caught the flu. I didn’t really know what was happening. I’ve dealt with some withdrawal before, but I didn’t think it could happen with weed. I mean for a long time I didn’t even think you could get addicted to weed. Sure enough, I took a couple hits and was back to normal in less than a minute. 

I did some research and it confirmed what I suspected. Weed withdrawal is definitely a thing. Most people online said they started to feel better after about 10 days. I keep trying, but so far I’ve hardly been able to make it two days (and one miserable, sleepless night). 10 days sounds like a fucking eternity. I know that people beat withdrawals way worse than this, and I have faith that I’ll succeed in time, but I’m wondering if anyone who’s experienced this before has any tips on mitigating the symptoms or knows of any good resources for people trying to quit. Any advice is appreciated.

He really wants to quit and have been trying for years. Last year he went to a rehab in Thailand and started taking a medication called Chantix (I think that's how it's spelled) and he came from smoking 50 cigarettes a day to 3 cigs a day!! Amazing right? The problem is, as he came back to ""real life"" he ended up picking the habit back up and now he is smoking about a pack a day. He tried patches, therapy, read books, cold turkey, and nothing worked for him so far. He really wants to go somewhere specifically designed to quit smoking. Somewhere nice with a program that helps him and where he can be surrounded by people with the same goal. He loved his experience at that rehab last year, but that place is more for other addictions and as most rehabs, smoking is actually allowed there. So he was constantly surrounded by other people smoking. He wants a place that forbids him to smoke, like the rehab forbid him to drink, and offers him treatments at the same time. We are willing to invest in this experience for him, so it could be anywhere in the world. Sounds easy to find right? But not really. We've been constantly looking for options and most places that offer a quit smoking program offer other programs as well, so they usually have at least a smoking area, if they don't allow smoking anywhere outside. This is really difficult for my husband because he really wants to not have any triggers around him and he wants rules to hold him accountable (that's what he thinks will work for him). We found one place that offers something like this, it's called Sha Wellness Spa in Spain, but it's SUPER expensive. I mean, there must be something more affordable, right?

So here is the question: does anyone know of a place / retreat / rehab designed specifically for people who want to quit smoking and that doesn't allow smoking anywhere in the facility??

Briefly about my use:I started smoking at young age because of internet, i was courios about weed and i wanted to try it, through a friend I found some weed and i fell in love with it, for the first year i smoked some low potent sh\*t(litteraly), i was young and i had no self-awareness so i developed hard addiction really fast, me and my ""friends"" spent whole days looking for and smoking weed, I wasn’t aware of how far I got into it all, I was a child and I didn't have my own money, that is, when I had it, I would spend everything on weed, so i started selling a little bit, it wasnt anything special but anyway it coud fuck up my life, but i was lucky and careful so i didnt get caught ever. Now with a bunch of weed for smoking every week, it started to get out of control, i was smoking in the morning alone, then go to see some ""friend""(those are friend only when we get to smoke) and i woud smoke with them some more and then again in the evening,i was blazed whole day everyday. All of this lasted a couple of years, i was going deep in the rabbit hole, i didnt do anything beside smoking weed, in my high school me and couple of my friend smoked everyday in school and we did a lot of other drugs(that is whole another story but its related to weed and those friends, i was using ecstasy,amphetamine,cocaine,smoking cigs from 15 to 17, but i managed to stop my use successfully but i ended up stucked with heavy marijuana dependence). After all the shit i got in touch with some high grade stuff and but i was realizing that i was really addicted and started to moderate my use and eventually i tried to quit a couple of times, i was having really bad insomnia,no appetite,my head hurt, i was feeling terrible and i relapsed because of that.

So now we get to time when i finnaly managed to quit everykind of drugs, gym helped me a lot, i quited synthetic drugs and ciggaretes because of gym, and after that, everything started to go in right direction(when i was 17), then when i was 20(3 months ago) I was ready to go trought withdrawal and finaly end up my imprisonment.After 10 days all withdrawal vanished and I felt better than ever, i was sleeping like a baby, i was sharp again and i enjoyed life again and everthing was going in right direction, i was hitting gym hard like always, i was reading books a lot more, trying to improve family business, i was working hard on every aspect of my life and then...

Yesterday one friend asked me if i want to smoke, i was like no thanks at first, but then something clicked and i changed my mind, i read that anyone who after heavy demendepnce smokes again for one time, addiction comes back and you start using again i get to the point where you started, i was feeling like that is not the case with me and for some weird reason i wanted to smoke again, i didnt know why but my subconscious actualy did know. So here are some negative things I was reminded of when it comes about smoking weed.

1.First i needed to get in contact with people i dont like who have bad influence on me because of their maturity and they are bad people in general, it isnt always the case but rarely is anyone good in that environment.

2.We needed to sneak through the neighborhood and go to some wild place to be safe and chill, it was evening so we didnt see anything beside our faces and it was looking really bad like we are some junkies.

3.I rolled one joint and we got really high and i was thinking about everything and was so self-aware and now i was seeing a lot more than in past where i was just feeling high and didnt give a damn about how it was affecting me and how i lived my life because of it.

4.We where just joking or laughing, we werent talking about anything normal or productive, i was aware of that feeling like i wasnt there, as if I were looking at everything in the third [person.](https://person.it/) It was really strange to me and i didnt like it a bit

[5.So](https://5.so/) with all this self-awarenes I just watched my behavior and the behavior of my friends and us together and i was understanding that it effect me in a bad way, i was talking a lot less, my mind is going wild but all those thoughts were a bunch of nosense and it was really unproductive time, just one big waste of time which has held me back for so many years

[6.It](https://6.it/) reminded me how i was spending so much time trying to find new weed, trying to hide it from the family, freinds, the constant intense paranoia, will my parents or police caught me, then a lot of time was devoted to smoking, i needed to prepare everything everytime, papers, weed, ciggarettes, water, eye drops, so sometimes(a lot of times) when i forget something i was going back to home to pick it up, i was constantly lying to my parents and everyday was filled with a lot of nonsense and procrastination

7.Yesterday when i was going home i just felt so washed-out, it was hard for me to even walk, i was just wanting to get home and get to bed, so i realized that every day for past 5 years were like that, constant exhaustion and paranoia, i was living for that to get to bed i feel relief from everything, but i wasnt aware of that

8.When i finnaly got home, I remembered how many times I was so high that I didn't even have the will to brush my teeth, I would just throw my clothes and go to bed and fall into some nasty state that looks more like anesthesia than sleep, so this time when i was aware i didnt do any of that,instead i was trying to read some article about development of my business but i realized that I can't understand one simple sentence, that my concentration was at zero, that feeling was so bad, the feeling of regression

9.I compared sobriety to this and i realized sobriety is so much better, i was socializing a lot more, a lot more talking, i was speaking and thinking clearly, i werent talking just some bs jokes and laughing like a maniac(this isnt bad but i think that it shoud be a one part of the conversation, not the only thing about you think and talk when you are out with someone)

[10.So](https://10.so/) i finaly realized that i cant do anything productive that night(which is really sad in my opinion)and I connected that to these past five years and realized how much productivity and progress my addiction has taken away from me

11.I realized how much time had passed in my fog and laziness, how much I was actually unhappy and unconscious about everything that was happening around me, my childhood was passing and instead of developing knowledge and skills, I developed an addiction so strong that my whole life revolved around marijuana, all my emotions were attachment to it and all were negative, and then when I finally got to it, I would hide all that negativity behind that feeling of high.

12.I realized that smoking weed is really bad for me, there is no progression, i was just really sad and weed was making me being that way, but it also dampened that feeling so it was a one big loop of feel bad and a little bit less bad, this time feeling high wasnt anything special, it was just showing me that it actualy doesnt give anything of value to me, it was just making me a bad person

13.Okey i talked a lot about it effect on my mind,but that is not the only bad thing, when i smoked my lungs felt burned, i felt pressure in my head and high pressure in my whole body, I haven't felt worse once in past three months. I was coughing and feeling weird in my hearth region.

14.And sleept so bad, i waked up feeling dizy and like i wasnt sleeping at all, sleep is crucial when it comes to living a fulfilled life and having energy to do right things and to avoid those bad things, so aside for every bad thing about weed i said, there is also that it destroys the most important life function and that is sleep, I have read books about sleep and weed has a similar effect on sleep as alcohol (destroys sleep in many aspects) so I think that sealed my opinion and the weed and its use and that after this I will never return to it again

Somehow deep in my subconscious, I knew that this return to marijuana was not permanent, as if my subconscious wanted to remind me what hell I was going through and that this good feeling was not worth it and honestly it disgusted me even more with marijuana, i dont think about smoking again, i actualy hate it even more, im happy that I have progressed so much mentally and that I understood everything that happened to me in the right way and learned a lesson from it, today I feel hungover but it will pass soon and I will be sober and happy again.

I hope this article will help you get over your addiction and get on the right track, I wish you good luck and remember that knowledge is power and that learning about addiction for a long time and becoming self-aware helped me stop using marijuana, if I didn't know many things it would be much harder for me to succeed, as they say you cant beat addiction if you don’t know you’re addicted, that’s the first step",22,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9930136799812317}"

Hello My Fellow Human Beings,

I am 7+ years clean from heroin. 
Trying my best to break the stigma of psychedelics and how they have healed my life. In my life, I was told nothing else would work except this program, but this ended up being invalid for me.

I have to be real, I never really agreed with “Once an addict always an addict “
This does not resonate with my soul at all. If I love myself, I must believe in myself, and if that’s true, I have to trust myself, or else how can I trust, believe in, or love others?

This mind-boggling conflict is was kept me relapsing and I ended up overdosing 4 times before I finally met an amazing friend that helped to point me down a different path of enlightenment.

I am spreading this message because I know there are people out there that need to hear my truth and my story. NA works, I promise, I have seen it with my own eyes, but it’s not for everyone. There is more than one way to overcome addiction. 

Sending love and good vibes your way, stay safe.

The truth is if you are on those drugs you are a weak willed person who has given up and are just giving yourself credit where credit is not due.  The reason why they are recommended is because they have high success rates.  They high high success rates because they are EASIER than being an addict and harder to get off of.  And then they tell you that you are clean and pat you on the back.  Human nature is always to avoid pain and take the easy route.  Never having to deal with cravings again because you are already on drugs.  That is exactly what maintenance offers.

I have kicked suboxone and methadone.  Been sick for 2 months.  After 9 months started to sleep more than an hour or 2 every other night.  So if you have done that and went back to it then you can lecture me.  I did that and stayed clean for 4 years.   It wasn't until a motorcycle accident and 8 surgeries that I fell back into struggling with addiction.  I had to go through all that shit again and only finally started to see my higher power once I got off the real government heroin.  Every single time I ask advice here I get fed the same bullshit.  I'm not hearing it.  Because anything that makes you sick for 2 fucking months is not clean.  Yes you may have a life with a wife and some kids and a job.  Big fucking deal man.  You achieved sexual reproduction and fulfilled your core biological function.  There is more to life than that.

I'm not trying to be a dick here.  I just noticed that every time anybody ask for advice on getting clean ppl try to sell you their government heroin.  You are literally turning people out.  It's the most fucked up thing you can do to someone.  Honestly you should just keep shooting dope or fentanyl till you are ready to just kick your habit and get clean for real it is MUCH easier.",0,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9965587258338928}"

I'm 28 with two kids, I've been taking Oxycodone off and on for nearly two years. This last year being a hard year for me with things going on, I didn't have anywhere I could go to express myself. Friends, family, they were all there but they never really listened to my cries out for help. The support I needed, I didn't have and I didn't reach out for as much as I should of. So I started taking Oxys. Hard. 
So now,  my mother (who I've stolen pills from many times) is here at my house with me, my brother is also here to take care of the kids so I can withdrawal in my icy cold dark bedroom by myself watching Netflix on the iPad. 
My body is aching.. I'm having little tremors here and there, I can't get comfortable, I'm pale, I'm cold yet I am hot and I, for the life of me, cannot stop going pee! 
I sit in this room, the thought of stealing a pill from my mother crosses my mind multiple times a day since yesterday.. However, before this I told her to hide them incase I got tempted and she did. Thank God. 
The only time I get any type of calmness is when I hear my children. 

I guess what I'm really looking for is support.

Could use some advice,"So, long story short, I’ve been an addict for about 6 years. I guess you can count the 4 years prior that I spent in college but I don’t recall ever having crazy addictive tendencies like I do now. 

I started with adderall, weed, booze and psychedelics in college. After I graduated when I was 21, I mostly just drank on the weekends and smoked weed pretty much every day. 

About 2 years into a crippling weed addiction, I realized that I had to get right. I was spending all my $ on weed and most of the time I’d just lay in bed gassed up AF. 

I managed to get off weed last year for about 6 months. Unfortunately during that time, I tried some coke. After that I was on and off it for about 6 months. Doesn’t seem like a lot, but I managed to screw up my life pretty good-especially financially. Im off it for good now and I’m fortunate that I’m not even thinking about it in the slightest-only when I feel bad about myself and what I’ve done to myself. 

On top of all this, I’ve been battling a porn/sex addiction that has gradually become worse with every relapse. Last year I was completely celibate for ~8 months and saw my life change for the better. Whenever I relapse I end up fantasizing encounters with people who I know who have been acquaintances in my life. Sometimes I’ll hit them up and try to get things going. Sometimes they’re with hooking up and other times they’re kinda like what that’s so random. 

In these last couple of months, a lot has changed mentally, emotionally and financially. A few weeks ago I was prescribed adderall again and ended up taking more than the dose I was advised to take. Because of this, I cut it out completely. 

It’s time to get clean. I’m afraid that one more relapse might put me in a depressive state that is worse than the ones I’ve been in before. 

I am 27 and live at home with my folks. I’m ashamed of being an addict under their food and they have no idea. They suspect something is up but I think they just feel I’m a bit depressed. I want to tell them that I think I need help but if I were to tell them I honestly think my mom would kick me out. 

So at this point I don’t really know what to do besides stay sober, go to meetings, try therapy and then just wait it out? 

Oh ive also  been unemployed for a few months, which adds to the shame and guilt.

Hi there,

I'm looking for a way to support my brother and hopefully get him help.

I am a 19 year old female and he is my younger brother. He is 17. He has been gaming since he was about 14. That's when he was given a playstation. He was interested in gaming before that and we always wanted our Dad to get us a Wii when that was big back in the late 2000's, early 2010's. But we were never aloud one for this very reason, our parents didn't want us on ""that shit"" as my Dad would call it.

I remember one day he got us the V.smile console. We were really excited. It's like one of those educational game consoles. My Dad was and is big on the whole educational thing at every point in a kids life. We'd always run to turn the TV off when he got home because he would yell that what we were watching was ""mindless shit"" and that we should just have the documentary channels.

My brother has ADHD, as do I. We also have a younger sister whose 12.

My brother who I'll call Sam has more severe ADHD than me and was diagnosed earlier than me. He was diagnosed about 2 years ago. I have a feeling that his gaming addiction has something to do with his ADHD. Maybe the way it tickles his brain, provides that much needed dopamine hit people with ADHD need. Our Dad also most certainly has ADHD too.

Our parents split up in 2017. It was a pretty terrible split as it wasn't a unanimous decision they made and came to their kids about. It was just our Mum saying to our Dad that she was leaving him and a fight (that didn't happen often) erupting.

And then she left about a week later on their wedding anniversary. So all around a pretty shit situation. I was pretty affected by it, as the eldest of the children I understood more of what was going on and my parents got me involved between their issues before and after the separation.

So I believe that because I was going through so many issues my brother's issues got pushed to the side and forgotten.

Our parents don't have a family court agreement or anything as they only got formally divorced this year and are yet to go through settlement or custody stuff. Although now the only custody they would be fighting over is of our younger sister as my brother is 17 and legally allowed to leave home if he wants too and can choose where he lives. Throughout these past years both my brother and I have been doing chunks of time at different houses. It would go from 1 week at 1 house to staying at Mum's for months one end and then Dad's for months on end. Our parents are polar opposites in almost every way so It's like a culture shock going in between. I think that instability would have aided my brother's gaming addiction.

He got the playstation when he was about 14 or 15. I don't know whose house he was at, at the time but I believe he payed for half or part of it himself. Maybe even the whole thing. And ever since then he's basically been addicted. He loves it. He spends hours and hours and hours. He spends so much time that 1 time recently when I went to the bathroom their was a pee trail from the edge of the toilet to the edge of the bathroom and pee left in the bowl that was very dark in colour which indicates to me he'd been holding it for a long time and was in a rush to get back. When this happened this was a nearly 17 year old boy mind you.

At the start of last year he moved schools. He was at an all boys private school where he was getting bullied and his mates he thought he did have weren't sticking up for him. His grades where shit and my Dad decided with him that he should move. He ended up moving to a public school (a public school I made the move to in my final year of high school). He stayed with our Dad all throughout that year. He only moved back to our Mum's full time (where I have been living full time since I graduated high school in 2019) when our Dad kicked him out. He kicked him out because after they toured another school to move too and them both deciding it would be a good fit (because my Dad had come to the conclusion the public school was not providing him adequate support), he changed his mind after talking to our Mother for 15 minutes. So then he came back to Mum's house. And since then he's just been gaming.

At his first high school apparently even his school mates who he was playing with thought he was addicted by how much he was playing.

I think just after a few months of Sam buying the playstation years ago, our Dad told him he couldn't have it at his house anymore because he hated how much he played on it. Not long after that he did a gaming addiction test and scored like 90% on having an addiction. It was one of those quizzes that makes the taker answer questions like, ""do you think you have an addiction"". I think he probably deep down thinks he does but the only reason he was open about it was because of how intense our Father would of been about it. Dad would have been talking about it to him for hours and hours for weeks and weeks. He probably just did the test and said yes I'm addicted to get him off his back.

But back to the last 8 months.

My brother plays ever hour he possibly can. My Mum has tried to put in place restrictions but she always breaks when he puts pressure on her. I'm pretty sure she's given up on being a parent. She usually keeps the playstation in a safe. But that only ever lasts a couple of weeks. He stays up to all hours of the morning. Shouting at his teammates or just random words. He has a blue ethernet cable running from the wifi modem in our Mum's room through the living room to his room into his playstation. He is violent towards me.

He is angry at me because I accused him of touching me inappropriately on my breasts and making inappropriate comments and hitting me 2 years ago. I also said that he got into bed with our sister and humped her. All of the is true, I never lied. I told my guidance officer at school and the police got involved. My parents called me pathetic and that I should have been able to take it or fight him off because I'm older and fat and bigger than him. Ironically that's one of the only things they can agree on. One of the instances that is relevant to this situation is him hitting me with a belt because I turned off his playstation because I wanted him to get off it, but our Mum wasn't telling him to.

My brother is probably upset, traumatized and hurt from that situation with the cops as they came to the house.

Nothing ever eventuated from that, they never came back or followed up.

In the last 8 months he has ripped 9 shirts while they have been on my body, off my body. The police have come to the house after being called by the neighbors once. I broke his hand. This was after months of begging my Mother to do something to get him to stop. I didn't do it on purpose. I was pinning him against the wall trying to restrain him so I could talk to him.

Our Mother does nothing and blames me for provoking him or tells me that I should just ignore him. 

The pure rage I see in him is horrible.

He is literally seething when he spits out these insults that I hate to admit hurt me. The fucking cruelty and hatred in his eyes is something that makes me deeply ashamed. Whether it's ""fat cunt', ""fat lard"", ""heffer"" or whether he sticks his hands under his shirt and round his belly out and point at me to replicate my body shape at the moment. Or his long winded rants. I guess what hurts more is probably our Mother's lack of reaction to this. She could have nipped this in the bud but she didn't. Because it certainly doesn't happen at Dad's house. Or the time he just shook his head and looked at my legs and said ""nice legs"" because they are fat. His hatred that's directed at my size really is worrying.

I think he's desperate to do anything to not have his playstation taken away. So he dredges up all my past mistakes. The money I stole from my parents, my weight, no friends, no job, no study, no prospects. I think he does this as his way of trying to delegitimize what I am saying to our Mother. When I beg my Mother to take his playstation away, get him to do more jobs around the house, not expect the women of the household to clean up his clothes from the bathroom or clear his dishes or clean the chocolate ice-cream marks from all around the kitchen and every door in the house and in his room because he doesn't seem to know how to wash his hands.

Mum cleans his room for him, with the excuse that his ADHD makes it difficult for him. I have ADHD, I push through whatever executive function issues I have. There's a difference between supporting him and doing everything for him.

Our Mother btw said to me a number of months ago during an explosive fight I was having with her (me being the explosive one her just saying she's too tired and wants to go to bed while I'm trying to get her to listen to me about Sam) that she now believes that what I was saying about Sam touching me 2 years ago could have happened, but that ""it's probably normal for brother's to touch their sisters on the breasts until they are asked to stop"".

This is the kind of parent we are dealing with.

This violence from him has been going on for years and only escalated. This violence mind you has not been intense to the point it has left bruises nor hurt beyond 10 minutes after. I have been begging for our Mother to do something about it for that long. But far more intensively in the last 8 months since he was kicked out of our Father's. Almost everyday I have asked. Our Dad got him into an ADHD specialist of some sort about 5 months ago who apparently explained to him that violence is wrong. That didn't stop the violence. The only reason it's stopped in the last month is because he had an operation on his hand. I am at my wits end. It is clear out Mum is not going to do shit. So now it's up to him.

I believe he needs intensive therapy to uncover years of hurt. He has never actually been to a therapist that he says has understood him. He has never opened up about how Mum and Dad's separation and the shit that came after affected him. He needs to uncover and talk about why he thinks gaming has been helping him cope.

I believe that my brother is like so many other kids who believe that if school doesn't work out, if he doesn't succeed in a career path or get a job he'll just be a streamer.

Not only is being a streamer successful for less than 1% of streamers, it's sad that this has consumed his whole life.

He doesn't have any confidence in himself. Not in his academic abilities or his personal abilities. He's had bullying issues at every issue he's ever been at. Not severe but enough to wear him down. He's always been the quiet sensitive mommy's boy.

He was okay at a particular sport but maybe when he found gaming he got his confidence hit. And that's all he needed. And gaming was more accessible and didn't take as much effort and he didn't have as much pressure from Dad to perform.

Maybe gaming is the only thing that gives him confidence now.

He also can't do his sport because of his hand. I feel badly about that.

I believe he's going to be the 30 year old still living with his Mum, playing video games. His metabolism will catch up to him like it does to the men in our family in their 20's and all the shit food he eats will catch up with him. He'll be even more unhappy with his life. He'll be collecting social security. If he has a job it will be at a grocery store at something (nothing wrong with that if you like doing that, but this will not be out of choice for him).

He'll turn out like our Grandfather. Bitter and pretty insufferable.

And that would be a tragedy. 

I don't want to lose the Sam I knew to that. '

He is 17 he can still change.

But unfortunately our parents aren't going to be able to do it for many different reasons.

He's going to have to want to do it.

Our parents aren't going to do it but they have not prepared him or any of their kids for that. It's not like we grew up with inattentive parents. They just stopped after they split. Dad tries more but his controlling nature is so intense and it seems every decision he makes is only because it's the direct opposite of what Mum says. I feel like with a lot of poor kids out there they realize that there parents aren't going to help them or make decisions for them at a very young age. But our parents switched from being so attentive to the opposite. We are unprepared.

Especially my brother. I've realized this fact about our parents so I'm working through it.

My sister is 12 so unfortunately I think she's already pretty independent because she feels her parents aren't going to help her or be there for her with everything because they are focused on other stresses including her siblings.

But Sam isn't. He's lost in my opinion. Not prepared for a life where he has to make his own decisions. He'd be lost even if our parent's were still the kind of over bearing parents they once were. Because just the overbearingness makes kids transition to adulthood harder.

He's never made a decision for himself. His first job where I was trying to get him to be more independent and develop confidence and start earning money because I wish I would have earlier, I applied for him for. It was at a chain company. I went through the quiz, details and filled in the paper work and got him an interview.

He needs to work out who he is and what his morals are and what he values.

What do I do?

What helped you out of this addiction?

I believe I as the eldest sibling need to turn into someone respectable. Who he respects.

Right now he doesn't respect me because I'm fat, jobless and he's angry at me about what happened with the police 2 years ago.

Maybe if he see's someone who got out of the specific fuck show of a family situation he's in and made something, that could help him.

Because right now he isn't going to take any advice from me.

I have hurt him a lot with my overdoses/mental health episodes. I have put the family and him through a lot of worry. And he's hurt.

I have not stole money from anyone in over a year and a half. Not even a 10 cents off the counter.

I have not overdosed in over 2 and a half years.

Now I need a job and to get healthy and build my life.

He's watching Bill Burr's ""No reason to hit a woman"" video in front of me and laughing.

He's heading down the wrong path.

About 15 years ago, my sister began her addiction with prescription opiates, and eventually this elevated to heroin and who knows what else. Much of this time, my family has been subjected to the typical lies, stealing, fighting, and suffering that you would expect from someone going through an addiction of this caliber.

For a long while, my parents understandably did their fair share of enabling her, such as letting her stay at the house when she had nowhere to go, giving her money when she said she needed it, etc. Usually this always ended with her stealing from them.

Anyways, I had decided to resort to no-contact maybe 10 years ago. All of a sudden, now she is trying to make contact with me through social media, and when I don't respond, she is trying to make me feel guilty. 

""I tried. I shouldn't have listened to mom when she said to reach out to you""

""Why do you hate me?""

I kind of want to respond once, letting her know I don't hate her, but that I want her to recover and become her normal self before we can reconnect. At this point all these years later, I feel like she is essentially a stranger to me, and I absolutely do not want to give in and enable her, or break my no-contact rule.

I do feel kind of guilty for cutting her out of my life, but I also feel it was overall a good decision for my own mental health. I have no desire to bring her back in to my life right now to be honest. 

As far as I know, she is still very much an active addict/user.

Do I break my no-contact rule to let her know just this once? Or would that do more harm than good by ""opening up the line of communication""?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9911285638809204}"

My brother who is currently 26, & 5 years younger than me is having a very hard time coping with her death and has been since before the day she died. Unfortunately my brother found her dead. I can only imagine the trauma and the sadness he feels. I can relate to him but not fully, as I was my moms care taker and she had many suicide attempts/drug over doses, which I happened to be the only one who saw or found her in that state until my brother experienced her lifeless. I am in no way trying to discredit him in any way. BUT- (there’s always a butt) he has been using this as a crutch to drink himself stupid. He has lived with me almost his entire life, until a few weeks ago he finally got his own place. When my mom passed I felt an obligation to care for him bc we don’t have parents to rely on. He lost her in his formative years and I wanted to make sure he was okay and would be able to live & do on his own. In between all of that, he is a terrible drunk. And I know the fuel to his fire is his grief and PTSD. BUT I worry about him tremendously & I don’t want to tell him to “get over it” bc it’s absolutely insensitive & rude. But I want to tell him to get over it. I want him to move on and not mask his sadness in drinking.

addiction obviously can impede on your freedoms though. Addiction can be genetic and environmental, your financial stability, mental and physical health, trauma, community/family or lack of—these can invite substance abuse, not the drugs themselves. If you’re going to use drugs there are safer ways to use any drug—if you’re unfamiliar with this concept that’s is OK—harm reduction is a set of principles that meet you where you’re at, without judgment or coercion. Whatever you’re doing, you’re ok—please know that there are people out there who don’t judge you for your choices and who just want to make sure you’re safe. Rehab often wants you sober to attend...that’s like a hospital wanting you to be cured of your disease before they treat you.

I kicked in 2014 and was clean for 4 years. I was in a bad accident requiring multiple surgeries over the course of a year and became dependant on prescribed meds an have since progressed to fentanyl.

The standard of care has become really bad here in WA state due to American law and politics. Laws are designed around the biggest idiot in the room and fear of getting sued. Because of this detox places now give you far less meds. No more sedatives or benzos. Suboxone clinics expect you to just cold turkey on your own first. I have considered trying Suboxone bernese method or a slow methadone taper.

Provided I do a slow taper and have good discipline would this in theory be the best? A lot of ppl say do cold turkey because it teaches you. I have cold turkeyed over 20 times made it multiple weeks and it didn't teach me shit I just don't sleep for 3 weeks. The first time I got clean I did a slow Suboxone taper and succeeded on first try with minimal withdrawal. 

The problem is now my habit is much higher than before and Suboxone is not working for me. I try detoxing 48 hours first and doesn't work. The Bernese method says to microdose so if anybody has had success with that please let me know I don't want to go into precipitated wd if I don't have to as it won't result in me staying clean anyway.

One of my bosses introduced me to cocaine and then that’s when I knew I had an addiction problem I ended up using meth and it was all over. 

I used for about a year till I met my current wife and she got pregnant. I was able to stop and pretty much could say I got over the addiction for 8 years till she was unfaithful. It quickly turned into binging and I lost the ability to stop. We tried working things out but my trust issues made me need a coping mechanism and that was the dope. 

I used on and off stopping for weeks and sometimes months at a time but always failing to stay sober. Until 3 years later when I went to a church and got saved. I was able to quit cigarettes and dope in one day . I stopped and was  truly the happiest I’ve been in a while . Me and my girl ended up getting married and everything was great . I was even an usher at our church and I loved it. 

Then the pandemic hit and shut down our church. I was working hard labor still and started to drink after that my will power went to shit and of course the devil takes advantage. I ended up using again and didn’t stop for two months till I got caught. I knew it would happen. I ended up stopping so I didn’t lose my family. 

Then In may I found out my wife was being unfaithful Agian and this sent me to the edge of depression and I started drinking and then using to cope. I was separated from her for a month but decided to give it another shot. 

It’s just now with the trust issues I feel like I can’t relax or she will do it again. I know it’s the dope that makes me feel like that. Like she’s constantly messing up on me behind my back.

By the time she was in her 20's she was using, selling, burglarizing and violently assaulting people. She even attacked my girlfriend when I was overseas,

I was always really straight edge and didn't use or even drink. I went into the army after highschool which was a great experience. Unfortunately I decided to come back home after my enlistment to try and help my family. After a year of dealing with them I became depressed and started using heavy opiates and opioids. After four years of being in a daze and having sold a lot of my possessions, I made the decision to get clean. Part of my recovery strategy focuses on clean eating, working out and a healthy calm lifestyle, I avoid trouble because growing up I was prone to violence.

I accepted the fact that my father won't ever get his act together. He actually made fun of me for getting clean, and said he couldn't stand the sight of me.

My parents separated when I was in the military and my mother has been clean for three years now, after being diagnosed with cancer, she made the change to try and survive. 

My sister went to prison for 2 1/2 years and got clean. Since her release she got a low level county job with low pay but benefits and she's gotten a real second chance at life. In spite of our past I was happy for her. She's been back using for 6 months and its getting me depressed and messing up my calm. She'll call me at night stoned as hell and argue that she went to prison over some BS. She also mocks my sobriety and says I lord it over everyone.

Should I just cut ties with my father and sister and leave them to wither and die in pools of their own misery?

I'm really at a loss right now and I don't know where to go. My (24f) boyfriend (24m) of four years has smoked weed since he was a teenager; some eras more frequently than others. We met in college when he was into far heavier substances. We both had near-debilitating traumatic experiences and mental illness relating to it, but helped each other out of our holes, in a way. I opted to pursue counseling a few times, and smoked weed a few times (fewer than 5 in our relationship) with him for recreation, but never found it useful. (I did have an alcohol problem in college and quit cold turkey for a few months while I worked to repair my relationships with the people around me and substances. We met while I was in my six-month dry period.) Since then we've both experienced a lot of growth in personal, professional, intellectual, and interpersonal spheres. We also moved in together this year, and it's been going really well, and I love him more than ever. 

However, his weed use is wearing me down mentally and emotionally. I feel at fault in some ways, because a year before we got our place, I told him I didn't want to live with him until he quit; maybe conceding that has shown that he doesn't have to take my requests seriously. He did agree with me at the time, and has tried to quit several times, but it doesn't usually last more than a week. He made it a month once (he tells me, but he has been untruthful about it before) and repeatedly tells me he wants to discontinue the habit. But in the last couple of months it has gotten worse than it has ever been. He started smoking during the workday (he is remote, and I am hybrid so we work near each other some days, which can be a stressor) and it is interfering with his ability to do his job. Every afternoons, he leaves to smoke and doesn't come back until late at night — or, if he has weed here, he will smoke and then fall asleep until late at night, then wake up, smoke more, and fall asleep again. On weekends, he will see his friends to smoke and not respond to me or come home for multiple day stretches because he just wants to smoke. It's been very draining to me as we haven't been able to have very much sober quality time and actually do things together, but he says we live together so that doesn't matter. He can't make it an evening without using weed to unwind from the workday, and when he does, he is very regretful to me and wishes he could stop. 

He asks me to help hold him accountable and stay off it, but when I do it is unbearable. He becomes highly irritable, anxious, and says incredibly hurtful things. Today (another Day Zero, as he told me yesterday he wanted to stop) he threatened to kill me if he couldn't smoke. I try so hard to be extra patient on every Day Zero, but doing it over and over again is destroying me. He says such hurtful things. I know he's not himself and that the cravings are coming up with every possible reason to go back to it, so I try to let it roll off, but it does get to me.

I have thought of giving him an ultimatum: me or the weed. I'm so afraid to say it because I don't think he would choose our relationship. And I do love him so much. I'm just so, so tired of the cycle.

I never really did anything on the game just jumped off a rock. But I'd do this hours on end. As I grew up and begun playing games more and more and begun understanding the mechanics I begun delving deeper into the game and even thinking about it now, I remember the feeling of learning new parts of a game. It was always satisfying and still is to this day. And it's only recently I realised how bad my addiction has gotten considering I have over 40,000 hours on world of warcraft, 5,000 on Ark and around 3,000 on Rainbow six siege and right now I'm racking up hours on Genshin impact like nobodies business. I've spent my entire life playing games and all these hours aren't including off games I'd play as well. I havent spent my life playing just these games. Im now 17 and I have to resit my College year because I failed that badly. I also want to be able to create my own game, ironic isnt it. Someone who's addicted to gaming and wanting to quit I also really want to create my own game. An MMORPG type one at that. I've been telling myself that I need to do something with myself but never know where to start with anything. I've quit everything I start in my life. I did boxing for a few months. Couldn't stand it because all I wanted to do was play games. I tried going to the gym. But I just wanted to play games. This has pretty much ruined my entire life and I've spent 15 years of my life just playing games and all because it's the only thing in my life that I understand very well. I have so much motivation and ideas to make something out of myself with but I keep procrastinating the second I hit a wall I just play games and forget all about it until I hit another wall in for example at the moment is learning programming. This has been a really big issue for me and quite honestly, I'm lost on what to do. I can't quite gaming entirely but I'm scared that I will have to at this rate. Especially since a lot of mine and my partners enjoyment together comes from us playing games together and relaxing. I find that it doesn't eat away at me with them but it's still something thats there in that situation, like I want to play more games but it's not as bad with them.

My main addictions are internet entertainment, overeating, sugar and masturbating. I have been abstaining from one at a time since more than 2 years, with regular shifts in abstinence. Staying abstinent from all of them seems close to impossible to me but I'm trying it anyways. I am doing so in making a ""deal"" with myself: I stay away from these behaviors and in ""exchange"" I allow myself to do anything I want. 
This is, I think, the root of my addictions. I don't allow myself a lot of things. I put a lot of pressure on myself to be productive, talented, hard working, a certain way. I expect myself to fulfil my high expectations no matter what. Additionally, I'm scared of conflict and try very hard to avoid it by doing things that I think other people expect of me, no matter what I think of them. There is no space in the cage of all these expectations and pressure for me to relax, to feel, to be me, to act differently, to not perform and be the best. I don't let myself. It's like I'm always keeping myself up because I have some crooked expectation that I need to be, I don't accept my own boundaries and needs.
This dysfunctional behavior, of course, makes me feel very uneasy and bad at times, when I am ignoring my own feelings. To balance that out, I then use my array of addictions to push good feelings into my body then. It is the only way I can relax, because in my addictive behavior, I ignore all expectations and plans, I just consume. In a way, it is me taking care of myself, not letting my mood go too down, giving myself a bit of free space. That freedom then, of course, is used very dysfunctionally and the addictions add additional problems to my life.
This is what makes abstinence hard for me. Not being away from my addictive behavior but being alone in a room with myself, who won't let me relax for even a second and has this armada of high expectations I need to live up to every minute. And no band-aid to soothe my negative feelings.
Not automatically fulfilling all expectations from myself and others is harder than staying abstinent. It's automatic, I often don't even notice how it happens. It's uncomfortable and takes work to change. Staying addicted and staying dysfunctional is definitely the easier route. I'm trying to go differently anyways, because the addictions cause me problems and my dysfunctional living causes me problems. I want to be able to be me, what I am and feel inside, not what other people and especially myself expect to me. I don't ""have"" to do anything. This is my deal and I hope that it will work.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9587398171424866}"

I stuck to smoking it and snorting it, but preferred smoking it; and mainly just did that. About 4 months into my use, I developed a nasty lung infection. At this point my partner and I were both unemployed and scheming to find money. when we were desperate and couldn't find a way to come up with money, this is embarrassing to admit, I would scrap any dope off my wooden table; a lot of this was residue from my partner shooting and getting stuff on the table, and I'll be honest, I have no idea what I've smoked and inhaled over those 6 months; dirt, blood, I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, I went in and they initially told me it was bronchitis and it will go away on its own and to take tylenol and musinex.



At this point, I knew something was wrong, extremely wrong. I was wheezing, I couldn't breathe, walking, showering, doing any sort of basic activity put me into almost an asthma attack state.

Anyway, i had one of those ""asthma fits"" and my partner called an ambulance because I really thought I was dying. they put me on an albuterol inhaler and doxycycline, my O2 levels were normal at this point, but my infection was getting worse and the xrays of my lungs came back and they were clearly swollen and had stuff inside them. 



They told me it was most likely pneumonia from my use, they said I probably ""asperated while asleep due to my constant vomiting"" I didn't buy it. I thought they were just trying to freak me out, they treated me horribly, making snide remarks about being an addict, didn't give me any comfort meds when I told them I was going through withdrawals. I was there probably 9 hours getting pumped with albuterol, in pain, couldn't breathe and dope sick. 


A week later I was still experiencing my wheezing. So I went into urgent care because at this point, fuck the ER. My O2s at this point were at 80. Urgent care panicked and said they couldn't treat me and called an ambulance. I went into the ER yet again, they hooked me on a tank of albuterol, gave me some Prednisone, took another xray of my lungs and they definitely improved at least, they looked better than the last xray. But my O2s weren't improving at all and I was seemingly getting worse. at this point and they wanted me to stay overnight and that they didn't think I'd make it through the night, and that this was definitely due to my use. I refused to stay the night of course, I was angry at this point, my life was spiraling, I wanted to die anyway, I didn't care at this point and I certainly didn't want to go through withdrawals while having a lung infection, so I said fuck it, and ama'd. They gave me Prednisone and an albuterol inhaler to take home, and after two weeks my wheezing stopped and my lungs weren't in constant pain anymore, and I could finally breathe. 



Two months later I checked myself into detox and I'm now 3 months clean. I never want to go back, it was a nightmare. So many awful things happened to me in only 6 months of using, and it was constant trauma every single day. I'll be honest, my lungs don't feel the same still, I'm scared to breathe most days, and I still feel like my lungs are swollen. It's really scary. I'm scared my lungs will never totally go back to normal. Now that I'm in a sound state I can say I do believe my use contributed/had everything to do with my infection, that and me being an idiot tbh. Has anyone experience a lung infection with their use? Or in that case, any infection due to their use?",32,{'infect': 7},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994244575500488}"

So I have been sober 20 months but I just tonight totaled a car I bought less than a week ago that I need for my new job that I am starting next week. I was texting while I was driving and rear ended a car stopped at a redlight. Thank my Higher Power nobody was hurt, the other guy was driving a company car and it was still driveable but it still sucked for him of course. My car is totaled and my insurance is not gonna cover the full amount of the loan I just took out to get it, so I am going to be several grand in the hole making payments on a car I dont have and also, if I somehow figure out how to get a new car, on that as well. My question is how can I be so irresponsible and selfish and careless in recovering? What the fuck is wrong with me? I am such an incompetent piece of shit, I could have killed somebody because I was sending a stupid text. I feel like I should off myself or something. I felt like I was finally getting my life together and now I feel fucked. Having a car was gonna improve my life so much open up so much opprotunity for me and I threw it away its all my fault and its like How do i love with a mistake I made completely sober?

My friends varied in what their experience was like. Some saying they felt almost nothing, but me in particular, I felt more concentrated, more enthusiastic than I had ever been in my entire life. In fact after the exam I got home and studied for an extra 4 hours for the next exam.

Another friend also found it very helpful but that was the start of something new for me. I felt limitless.

Anyways after high school I got into trouble with severe depression to the point I wanted to suicide. I had passed my driving exams as a result of some dexamphetamine I got off another friend and i used a lot of my money to buy more and money to see a psychiatrist several times.

I was put on SSRI's in particular, fluoxotine. My dose I started to raise it myself and I got into a relationship with someone. My doctor prescribed ritalin at first to me after finally getting the ADD-inattentive diagnosis which I eventually did not end up liking because I felt too 'drugged' into focusing, so changed to dexamphetamine.

I will admit I was addicted to dexamphetamine, partly because of the relationship I was in, it was an online relationship but one I valued very much and I constantly wanted to be at my best. I frequently went over the dose but not just for dexamphetamine, for the antidepressants aswell.

I was a reckless 18 year old at the time and I'd used my own money and not told my parents a thing about the medications. I was admitedly a bit immature and stupid looking back on it. 

Anyways it ended with a hospital experience which was the most dreadful nightmare of my life. To see the parents shame, and honestly I just hate when they worry about me. I was taken off the antidepressants aswell as the dexamphetamine and ontop of that I had a diagnosis of psychosis put on me so was not allowed the medications back- I was never psychotic just I was withdrawaling from a tonne of meds at once.

Anyways I'm 21 now and Ive smoked a tonne of weed, done ritalin, vyvanse, dexamphetamine many times from other people and never really had the same issue of ""psychosis"", I just had to get my life under control.

In two days I have an appointment with another doctor who dosent know my history of psychosis. My friends had given me some vyvanse - but a pretty big dose 70mg so I usually halve it, and I've barely been able to keep my addictions to the stimulants under control. I figure if I go for Vyvanse (long acting lisdexamphetamine) as oppose to dexamphetamine, I won't be tempted to go over the limit because one thing I value very much is getting a good night sleep every single night.

I often get Seroquel, diazapam, dozile or/and temazapam and other various medications to ensure I get to sleep regardless of how much vyvanse I've taken. It seems to be working and I feel like I could potentially get this under control now that I'm a bit older and more mature. It's a bit up and down as I prefer to have a lot of days off and really enjoy the stimulant high every now and then. It's when I'm most clear headed - I'm able to play piano, make progress, learn pieces, play chess, enjoy my hobbies more - although I don't have a very good social life so I'm trying to orchestrate more events into my life, but it's very hard without anyone pushing me.

The thing is I need this medication, like badly, I almost just give up when I'm not on it, I find it impossible to get anything done, however it turns into a bit of an addiction which is the problem. My brain craves dopamine and I admitedly have trouble sticking to my dose. To counteract this, I've tried using an Indonesian herb called Kratom which seems to lessen my addiction to the lovely flow of dopamine. It is quite effective admitted, secondly I figured I would suggest to the psychiatrist that I use vyvanse - the long acting dexamphetamine rather than dexamphetamine as dexamphetamine I find quite addictive....although the price for dexamphetamine is about 30$ here and vyvanse 100$ almost. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any tips on trying to remain on a consistent dose and not be tempted to use too much. I know I need them, but also my tendance to go above the dose is a problem:/. Is my dose harmful in any way? It is legal amphetamine and honestly I'd rather live my life like that then live a boring life living till like 80....anyways, just wondering your thoughts and advice?",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.989310622215271}"

Even though i had no prescription. Around 16 was when it started. At first it was Xanax and Valium. Then when i started having chronic pain from illness, it became Percocet, Soma, etc. I grew up in a horribly dysfunctional family setting. When i turned 18, I got Xanax, Percocet, and Soma from my psychiatrist. (HORRIBLE decisions were made, another story for another day). I started smoking when I was 18, I'm 26 now. However, now I use it to cope, more than anything. Everytime I up my dose, or force myself to stop taking for as long as I can manage, I take like twice the amount next time just so my tolerance doesn't build up and I can get the full effect of euphoria, even though it's so, so temporary.

I am a male in my twenties that has a broad interest in substances from use to abuse. I more like to spectate from the outside of the 2 way mirror. I am semi educated in the world of substance use as well as substance misuse. More recently I have noticed a very large increase in overdoses/deaths in my hometown as well as my current location. I assume this is primarily due to the blue M30 Roxys that are floating around. It is very clear to anyone involved in the rehab/user community, that these pills are just a way to brand fentanyl in modern times. Very few are now buying these tablets expecting them to be oxycodone, they now buy them  in hopes that they are a strong ""bean"". The weird thing about this is that, barley anyone is reporting and talking about the pressed pill epidemic. There is now a whole market of willing users and dealers for these clearly pressed pills, and it is starting to outgrow the legitimate pharmaceuticals industry (including black market resale). There has been very little coverage from the ground/street level. I was thinking about making a short film about this whole epidemic specifically about the blue M30 pills and Pressed Xanax tablets not containing alprazolam.  This will not be another generic fentanyl doc, it needs to be more specific in my opinion. The drug market has truly changed in the past decade when it comes to availability of substances being sold black market websites as well as social media such as: Telegram, Snapchat, Whisper, and Instagram. I would need people to help me preferably in different cities. We would conduct interviews with the homeless as well as functional users and record the process. I have many other ideas as far as dealers and illegal sale on the internet. This would be purely for educational purposes, and anonymity would come first. I have seen too much destruction. in my home city of Chicago and my new home of Nashville. If anyone is interested in working on the short film, feel free to shoot a pm.

I would appreciate your thoughts and suggestions to deal with this, I really, really do not want to become addicted.","Hello readers. First of all, I would like to thank you for taking your time to click on this thread. I seek your help. For the past couple of years I have been doing too much cocaine. I live in the Netherlands so it is extremely easy to order it. Especially when I am drunk, I tend to call my dealer and he will arrive within 30 minutes. I am not addicted yet, but the urge to order cocaine has become stronger as of the last couple of months, especially when drunk and with friends.

I love my life, and have good things going on for me. I do not want to become addicted. As of tonight, it is my 23th birthday, and decided to order a lot, resulting in me using 1.5 grams of it, including using 0.5 grams within 5 minutes, and a couple of friends also using a bit. They are a bit indifferent towards my use but do frown upon the fact that I always initiate the use and use the by far the most, but also usually participate in it but they take significantly smaller amounts. I have noticed that as of late I am increasing my portion size. It used to be 0.5 grams a year or two ago, but now usually goes to 1 to 1.5 grams. When I am sober I never have cravings, but when I am drunk the call to my dealer is quickly made, which I am not proud of. I do not use any other drugs than cocaine (besides alcohol). As of tonight, I promised my friends that I would not take any non-alcoholic drugs for six months, ending the 7th of February 2022. I gave my word, and I intend to keep it, but it will be difficult for me, especially when drunk. I am not completely sure that I will keep my word.

If you have any advice for me, I would be extremely grateful for it. I do not want to become addicted, and I feel like I am slipping away from my life due to the cocaine use. I use it arounds once every two weeks, which is not a lot, but which I want to cut down to zero. Especially because I do not really want to use it, but usually impulsively order it, which might become out of order and result in addiction. To be completely fair, I love the feel of it and how it affects me. However, I do not want to use it any more at all. I do not have a problem yet, but am on the verge of becoming addicted, which I really, really do not want to happen. I would be so, so grateful for any tips or advice from this community to help me. I want to stop, and am scared of becoming addicted.

To be fair, alcohol is a big part of the student live, and I take it in relative moderation and am in control of it, and do not want to stop drinking. I can easily party without alcohol, and have spent periods without it without any problems. I intend to keep drinking during my student life, but to stop using cocaine. Your help/advice/experience would be greatly appreciated. I think I can handle the six month pause but I am not completely sure of it. I am not sure, if I reach the six month mark, if I would extend it or use again, I just really love the feel of it. I am considering talking to a psychologist regarding this problem. I want to stop. Please aid me, I will be very thankful. I am quite desperate and a bit scared to be honest.

Thank you for taking your time to read this. I desperately seek your help. Please help me, I am scared and want to get my life back in order. I know I must do this completely on my own, but your advice or experience will inspire and aid me. As of writing this, I just returned from the party where I used the 1.5 grams, and feel quite happy, but even in this state, I want to stop. It is not worth the risks. I want to stop. Please help me. I will read every single reply to this thread and take them very seriously. If you take the time to reply and possibly share you advice and experiences, you will be doing me a great favour. Thank you.

I am extremely happy that I found this community, and even though I will likely not be active for too long, I will keep reading it every now and then and hopefully help where I can once I am hopefully fully recovered.

Im 15F and ive usually done it once every few days, nothing too bad, but in the past few months i basically started using it as a coping mechanism. It started because i self harm and whenever i tried to not self harm i masturbated instead as it has a similiar effect on me. Therefore it has become one of my best coping mechanisms now and i cant go more than 2 days without masturbating and i usually do it 1-2 times a day but im worried it could get worse.

Have a roommate/friend that needs an intervention with his dog and the behavior associated with it, it seems like owners addiction. First off little background, he is about to turn 35 same age as me, he lives with my wife and I in our home, which we dont mind at all he is a great roommate except when it comes to the dog. So lets give one recent example, 4th of July we invited people over he has the same friends as we do and he invited a group of people that were more his friends. Was a great time, yet he always has to bring his dog out when people are over and the dog goes crazy, jumps on everyone tries to get the food ect. Well eventually my wife has had enough and asks if the do can go back to his pen, my buddie does it, but then goes and stays in the room with the dog. Thus leaving the people he invited to come over out cold, they were great people and had a good time, but if I was invited to a party by someone and they left me to stay with a dog I would be a little upset. The dog is great when he is not around, does not jump on the furniture, does not run and rip up my carpet, does not tear up the room he is in. Yet when my buddy is back the dog is insane, runs around my house, jumps on the furniture ect, like he is gone for a week for work and the dog is chill, but sat he comes back and out the window that goes. If you say anything about the dogs behavior he gets mad and storms to his room, shuts the door then you can hear him say poopers you are a great dog everyone is just out to get you. Like another example, he comes home and has food, but has to take the dog out, thus the dog will jump on my counter to try to get the food. He does nothing, I get mad and into the room they go. Also we got a shock collar for the dog, and rarely do I need to use it, but when he is around the dog never gets a shock, he just beeps him after he tears through my trash or does something I have asked him not to do. Lastly which scares me the most is at 35 years old you should be looking for a woman, since he tells me how he really needs to meet someone and he hates being single. Well here is the kicker, he was seeing a woman for a few months, great girl super nice, had a good job was not filled with drama ect. She asked to go on a trip with him, just them and he asked if he could take poopers with him, she was like not on this one, he is poorly behaved and we really cant take him in places. Next day he comes back and goes you wont see so and so since she said poopers was poorly behaved, so ya I was like was anything else going wrong with her? He was like no she was great but me and poopers are a package deal, o yes he also lost a job because he was contract to hire and he called off like a week and a half because poopers had a cough. Thank God he found something else, the amount of damage poopers has done to my house, I need some help with paying for it.

He reminds me of someone with a drinking problem, I lived with one years ago and saw the same behavior. When homie was not on the sauce he was great, but man when he got back on. It was excuses, someone else fault ect.

It is the same, un dog related he is great, helps around the house(unless poopers caused the damage he will ignore it) cooks ect.

I have lived with actual drug addicts and they did not have the addiction level this guy has

2021-08-06 14:21:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ozce3z/my_relationship_with_a_cocaine_addict_after/,"My relationship with a cocaine addict. After breaking up, he's apparently trying to get his life in order, clear debts, get clean. He said he wants us to work but needs time. I dunno if I should believe him.","So here's the story of my ex (36m) and me (32f). 

We were Facebook friends for a long time before I added him as a friend on playstation we didn't talk until the first lockdown where he noticed I was playing a game that he liked and no one else on his friends list was playing or enjoyed.  We started talking, super long posts as we're getting to know each other and eventually flirting and being lovey dovey with each other and creating emoji patterns of love hearts and kisses in our text messages.  We both mentioned we have kids. I know his ex from my teenage years and know she's not a very nice person and At this time he had filed for court to get proper access to his daughter because the mum was messing around with his time, so he wanted something concrete.  He was allowed a video call with his little girl once a week and he'd do it without fail, you could tell how much he loved her. 

After a few weeks, he came round for a date which went really well to the point I saw him everyday for 2 weeks, we chilled, went out and had lots of fun and laughs.  We were falling for each other quickly.  We went out 1 evening with a couple of his friends and he asked me if I'd be exclusive/official with him and I said yes.  He showered me with gifts, surprised me with a new TV, bought me new shoes, put together a pamper hamper, bought us matching hats, we had fun nights in, playing cards, cooking together, romantic baths and showed me the love and affection that I'd been craving for so long from someone I felt the same for. He used to say things that made my heart flutter, complimented me all the time.  Everyone I knew mentioned that they'd never seen me so happy. He made me feel loved, I was head over heels. 

One weekend we went away camping on a beach.  We were cuddled up by the fire and got into deep talks about marriage, kids etc. He told me he loved me first. Somehow we got onto the topic of drugs.  He told me he has done drugs in the past.  I told him I don't like drugs and that's a no go for me and he said he doesn't and won't touch them again if it means it'll come between us.  

This is a conversation that stuck in my head (which we'll come back to, alot)..... 

About 2 -3 months into the relationship our connection felt so strong and real, I knew I didn't wanna be without him and felt so secure in everyway that I was happy to move him into my place.  This was also around the same time he had just got his own place but decided to let it out to his brother rather than give it up.  1 Friday I was feeling naughty, he was at work, so I wanted to surprise him for when he got home.  I sent a raunchy picture to him telling him to hurry home.  He loved the picture and said he'd hurry back.  He didnt arrive home his usual time, I waited 3 hours for him to get back,I felt stupid waiting there dolled up in sexy lingerie and heels. I had a gut feeling about something but was so happy to see him when he finally walked through the door that I pushed it to 1 side.  We started making out and I noticed him acting a little weird, grinding his teeth, viciously chewing on gum etc.  I tried to not think anything of it and we enjoyed the rest of our night even though this thought was at the back of my mind.  He's given me no reason to doubt him so there's no need for me to bring anything up. 

Then, there was another time.  He didn't come home after work, I phoned him to see where he is and he told me he was with his brother and will be coming home soon.  Thats fine, waited a little longer, nothing.  Phoned him again, he said he may not be able to come home because he's had too much alcohol, he sounded funny to me so I straight out asked him if he was on something, to which he denied and I said OK, see you later but in future give me a heads up so I'm not expecting you home and wondering where you are.  The rest of that night is a blur but all I remember is how tight my stomach felt and all the thoughts racing in my head. 

He did this a few more times and eventually ignored my texts and calls every time he went out, until 1 night I'd had enough.  I was child free that weekend so when he didnt turn up and my anxiety and thoughts had rocketed, I had to find out once and for all what was going on, I already had a gut feeling, I needed answers.  So I hunted him down... 

I drove by his mums, his brothers, a drug dealers house he told me about before and then I eventually found his car at his best friends house, my bf walks out and he saw my car outside and ran round the corner, I quickly got out to chase his ass but he disappeared. While seeing if he'd come back, I peaked through the window of his friends house and saw his best friend, his best friends girlfriend and another girl who I'd never seen before.  You can only imagine how much my blood was boiling and heart was racing! His best friend comes out and said my bf text him to say I was waiting for him outside.  I asked to see the messages, his friend hands me his phone and I quickly notice my bf had been asking for drugs, cocaine to be exact, so my gut feeling was correct but now there's an added issue! He invited me in to which I did with all guns blazing demanding to know what was going on, who is this girl?! I'm at home on my own, he's ignoring me and they're all there having a good old get together!! His best friend assured me its not what I think and she's actually a good friend of his.  I calmed down a little and waited for my bf to come back, he looked terribly guilty and we obviously had an argument.  I wouldn't speak to him properly to the point he was getting annoyed and theatened to break my car windows. I should've ended it there and then if I had any self respect but because of how I felt about him I couldn't let go.  I thought I'd be able to help him and obviously thought so low of myself that I wouldn't be able to find anyone who gave me the energy that he did before and someone I felt a strong connection with and insanely attracted to.  

On the way home, he told me he doesnt like doing drugs, he hates how it makes him feel and how he hates being around it but wouldn't admit to being an addict. 

My trust had been broken, my self esteem shattered.  My anxiety heightened.  

He was on good behaviour for a while after that.  We spoke about helping him, he said he wouldn't do it again and needs to focus on the court case.  Shortly after this incident his rights to a phone call with his daughter had been taken away and replaced with indirect contact, his ex had also made the courts aware of his drug use to which he now needs to provide a drugs test.  He'd also lost his job in this time too because he'd constantly let work down because he couldn't get up in the mornings. 

His ex - was also a cocaine user, he told me how they'd use together on nights out and in actual fact she was the one who'd usually buy it.  She apparently didn't treat my bf very nicely either, was out all the time or working all the time.  Wasn't a nurturing mother to their child, put up the perfect life pasona on Instagram and she eventually found someone else, which as I found out not so long ago was also how my bf and his ex got together in the first place.  She'd done the same thing to another guy with my bf. 

Back to the story.  I decided to stand by him.  From our talks earlier in the relationship, he doesn't have any support or any decent role models in his life... 

His backstory - eldest of 3.  Sadly they lost their middle brother in an accident while he was walking home from a night out.  My bf thinks his mum and dad hold him accountable for it because he used to look up to him and wanna be like him.  His parents aren't loving, their marriage is abysmal.  His dad talks to everyone like shit, is extremely dismissive and narcissistic, spends all of his time playing games in his room.  His mum puts up with everything and doesnt stick up for herself.  Its clear his parents don't love each other.  He got sent to live with a family friend for a year when he was younger because his parents didn't want him around or felt they couldn't cope.  

So as I said, he was on good behaviour and seemed determined to get better, everywhere he went, I went with him.  Especially when going back to our home town because as soon as he's there he got triggered and I was the deterent.  Because it was lockdown, we stayed in for 3 months.  He wanted to take up streaming which would help him too.  So we got him set up and was having a blast.  However, all affection, compliments and everything I got from the beginning of the relationship had diminished.  I started becoming needy, clingy, moody because he refused to meet my needs when I know he's perfectly capable of doing so.  I ended up doing everything in the house, I was also helping him with his daughters letters, giving him ideas to make her smile and helping him with his streaming.  I supported him financially, which is lucky because I'm pretty good with money otherwise that would have been another struggle. While at the same time dealing with my mental struggles of how I felt about myself and the relationship, past relationship experiences also crept up again because I'd been treated badly before(my daughters father left me after 2 weeks of finding out I was pregnant after telling me and my family that he will stick by me no matter what.  He broke up with me over the phone on my birthday and was cheating on me with his ex, he denied paternity and told everyone I'd got a termination). All I wanted in return was the love he had shown me at the start which was taken away by my discovering of his problem. 

I felt we were turning into his parents, he'd be playing games and binging films and TV shows.  Never wanting to participate in the fun we used to have together like card games or board games.  He seemed to isolate himself, like his dad.  Arguments were getting worse and I felt like I wasn't being heard, usually because he'd just shut the whole conversation down.  He became extremely emotionally unavailable.  

During this time, his brother was refusing to pay rent to my bf and kept using the excuse that he owed 100's because of the amount of gear they've used together where he's bought it.  He didnt pay any bills so was wracking up a big debt that my bf has to deal with, their parents weren't getting involved and was actually siding with his brother. 

I noticed a few times he'd get irritated by me coming with him to places now, he was obviously craving.  1 time I couldn't force him to let me go with him to his mums and as soon as he stepped outside that door without me, I knew i wouldn't see him until the next day, I knew my attempts at contacting him would get ignored.  I was right....only, I didn't know he could stoop lower. 

About a week or so after, my daughter lost a tooth 1 day.  When she was in bed I rummaged through my savings pot, only it didn't feel right.  I knew I had some notes in there somewhere, they were usually at the bottom so I topped the whole thing out and the money wasn't there.  He watched me do it while he was on a game and when he saw me look at him he just casually said ""oh yeah, I borrowed that"" I was gobsmacked! He wouldn't accept the term thief and actually tried to make me feel bad for the situation.   Another time I should've called it quits.... 

The final straw - obviously things between us at this point are hectic.  While I'm trying my best to support him, he's making me feel crazy and says I'm wanting too much and need to chill out.  By now he's not sleeping, keeping me up most of the night with his gaming, sleeps most of the day and has produced a failed drugs test.  I still carried on however, until my birthday... 

He knew how big of a deal my birthday is to me.  I knew we couldn't do anything crazy because it was lockdown so even if I had a maid for the day, affection and a bit of pampering it would've made me feel good and i would have enjoyed my day.  The weekend before my birthday he spoke of making me a nice dinner and taking me out for breakfast like he used to do. But This maybe competes with the worst birthday I've ever had... 

I woke up, he was still awake, he hadn't been to sleep yet, I was first out of bed, he'd said he'd be up in a bit.  That rattled me straight away, why is he not making me coffee and breakfast? I ended up making HIM a coffee.  My little girl sits next to me ""whats for birthday breakfast mum?!"" She looks forward to a special breakfast on birthdays although this time it was the usual cereal.  He eventually gets out of bed and notices my face of thunder and asks whats wrong.  I explained I'm not happy I had to make my own coffee and in actual fact I made HIM 1, his excuse was that I got up first and he hadn't been asleep yet.  I get ready and take my daughter to school, he posts a happy birthday post on Facebook and I dont know if I was being ungrateful but it was shit.   pics of us and ""happy birthday to the fabulous (my name)"".  Seriously?! After everything I've done and put up with, that's all I get?! No kisses, no appreciation of anything I've done for you, no shouting to the world how much you love me and how much you think I'm your rock (he did a drunk stream 1 night and confessed to all of his viewers that o ground him in a good way and im his rock and he loves me) So I go home fuming and upset.  I try and get ready and start crying he asks whats wrong and I mentioned the post isn't near what I deserve after everything.  We have an argument and he ends it with ""ill take the fucking post down then"" and deletes it.  I continue getting ready and he asks what were doing today, clearly he hasnt planned anything or has forgotten about our previous conversation the weekend before.  I said ""I thought you were taking me out for breakfast""  he said well if that's what you wanna do.  We go for breakfast, the conversation isn't flowing, he's not trying to make me feel better but I try and get something to look forward to out of him so I ask ""so, what are you making me for dinner?"" His answer ""what? I have to make dinner too?!""  Again, completely gobsmacked and replied ""I do hope you're joking"" and he said ""well, what do you want?"" Unenthusiastically. I told him what I want and we went to get the shopping after breakfast which I had to pay for, with the birthday money he just gave me as a present from the ATM.  We get home and he hands me a card, I've seen this card before.  It was a card that he was meant to write in from my pamper hamper from months ago, no relevance to birthdays at all.  The message inside was lighthearted but not heartfelt, it was more of a joke and calling himself my hunk of a man.  The recycled card wasn't good enough as no thought had gone into it and I saw it as a cop out.  He's had ages to pick out a card and be a bit more thoughtful.  Knowing nothing was planned for us to do i sat in the living room where he joined me and asked if I wanted to watch a TV programme with him, I was in a bad mood so said no I don't want to watch TV on my birthday I wanted to have fun.  He then sat next to me with his phone and watched a Facebook streamer.  I went into the bedroom to try and sleep the day away to which he joined me and got me to cuddle up with him still watching this streamer.  I got up and sat in the living room again on my own before having to go and collect my daughter from school.  As I walked passed the bedroom doorway he had fallen asleep, I cried as I walked out.  I came back and he was still asleep so I took myself and my little girl round to my friends house, my friend insisted I stayed for dinner and tried to console me.  I was grateful for everything my friend did, and i was so lucky because he didn't wake up until 7pm, so if I had stayed home, I would have ended up making my own meal. I eventually get home at 9pm and put my daughter to bed, he didnt say much when I walked in just asked if I had a good time at my friends house, and he's talking to me while playing his game with his friends online.  I didnt want to speak to him so I shut myself away in the living room with a bottle of wine.  I needed to try and end the day on a high, I had been thinking of streaming myself, we both made a good community for streamers where we all became friends so I took the plunge and streamed.  I had 17 viewers on my very first stream and had a great laugh, my bf noticed how much fun I was having and joined me on my stream, I didnt wanna make a scene so I allowed him to.  Afterwards, I dont remember much because I pretty much drowned my sorrows, I know we didn't get intimate and there was no affection or apology from him.  He didnt even acknowledge I had a bad day. 

The next day, I ended it.  

There's so much more to the story.  The breakup was bad and he's continued to let me down.  If you want a second part to the story of me being a fucking idiot then let me know and ill bring you upto speed to the present day.",3,{'lockdown': 3},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9860399961471558}"

It has been a roller coaster of emotions to say the least. I met him fresh out of a 9 year marriage and I fell hard. Everything about him, every flaw, made me fall hard. I wanted so badly to save him. I wanted to help him on his path to sobriety. And I couldn't. 

Eventually, he relapsed and went on a different path that caused him to be taken away from me for a few months. He, at this point,  blames me and continues to blame me for every decision he's made. All of his hatred for everything he's been through in life he takes out on me. It's been extremely hard to stay and love him but I've realized I can't. I love him but I can't.

Loving an addict is hard. There are a ton of mental struggles they deal with. Some, not all, but some can put you through your own mental hell because of their own. He has mentally messed me up and made life hard for me; financially, mentally, and emotionally. Despite that I still love him so much and want to help him but I cannot. I have decided its time for me to truly consider letting him go.

Loving an addict has been such a hard and emotional learning experience. It's taught me that I'm stronger than I thought that I am and that I am capable of loving someone in ways I never thought I could. That I could be FAR more patient and understanding than I thought I ever could be. It has taught me that addiction is hard and that it truly is a disease that is hard to beat. One that takes immense strength and  Perseverance to overcome. It has also taught me that I would 100% do it again. I would love another addict, wholeheartedly, without a doubt. Even though this relationship didn't work and this man didn't turn out to be the life partner I thought I was supposed to end up with, I'd do it again. And again.  

To all of you addicts, you're worthy. I tried telling him but I think he's too far gone and doesn't believe it. But you may not be. You are worth loving. You are worth finding your person. You are worth being happy. And you CAN be sober. And you WILL be sober. Sobriety is possible and you will achieve it. I wish you all the best of luck.

I was a kid, 15 year old when i discovered benzos. I wouldn't talk about street drugs, i do shit load of them. i will just write about pills and opiates. 

I was kid as i say, and i was doing pills from time to time, when i finish high school i was not into pills just from time to time. I discovered clonazepam (Rivotril) and i start to steal pills from mother and i was one time so high i didn't know what i was talking i was in blackout and my mother say what i'm talking is nonsense. She say to my friend ""save him please"". I was heavy into pills, and what's most absurd, there was pharmacy that works people different nationality (I don't want to say what nationality) they are minor here. I think they didn't know or they are confused but they give us whatever we want, from benzos to ambien, tramadol. We are at the top. We are doing pills like a idiots, everyday we didn't know where are our asses, we are so so high. They give us like half a year, then, i suggest, the boss said that they sell us deadly drugs. Okay, now i do benzos from time to time. Like, my mother buy me diazepam (i said her i have a bad anxiety) , so she buy me. Usually now, i don't have a benzos but i must use clonazepam for example every 3-4 days because withdrawals came to me so badly. Next, i'm Pregabalin addict. i have maximum prescribed dose of pregabalin and i use 1200mg everyday becuase when i have money i just buy Lyrica. Motherfuckers make Lyrica so expensive, but okay. I use poppy pod tea. It's tea made from poppies, i just love opiate high. Mmm i'm now on Lyrica and poppy pod tea it's so fine lol. But i know all of it make me a addict zombie. It's sad, i'm young, have 23 years and i'm good looking and very smart (other people say, i ever never say that). So i will write here when i had motivation to kick my addiction.

2021-08-05 19:01:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/oyu1tn/im_launching_a_crypto_coin_to_help_people_with/,I’m launching a crypto coin to help people with addiction!!,"Hey all! I had a drug and alcohol addiction. At the age of 22 I was a homeless heroin addict. That year I found Recovery and was given a second chance at life. From that point on I have dedicated my life to helping people in need.
My identity is not my job or my bank account or my house. Those are all wonderful things, but I truly believe it is better to give than to receive. Along the way I built my own sober living and outpatient rehab facility to continue helping others and their families who suffer just as much. I’m sure addiction has impacted most people in this group in some form or fashion.

That being said one of the biggest hurdles I have come across is funding people who really need the help. As you know addiction burns a lot of bridges, but at the end of the day they are just sick people not bad people. I found a partner and some developers In which we are about to launch The Recovery Fund Official Recovery Coin Community! 

This is in essence a charity coin because every buy & sell goes directly to funding someone for treatment. But you can also make it an  investment.  Similar to investing in a start up company. If you were like me I was totally anti crypto until this year until I invested in Doge coin strictly because I own a Shiba inu and made a bunch of money. This got me to research it even more, and I really believe it’s the future. Right now crypto itself has only been around for 10 years! Imagine another 10!

I started buying in on ICO’s(initial coin offerings) and realized it’s just like investing in stocks but a lot more volatile. Find a project you believe in and a dump some funds in we never really know what’s going to happen with stocks or crypto. 

I kept on thinking and wanted to combine my passion for helping people into the crypto space. Wouldn’t it be great if we could profit and still get someone the help they needed. That’s where The Recovery Fund coin was found. It’s part of the Ethereum blockchain which is one of the most stable and heavily invested coins in the market. I realized we could use this coin to supplement people who either got cut off from insurance or just can’t afford to pay for the services they need. My facilities will accept it on day 1 of launch so it will immediately have a use case. The coin will be 2 conversions from USD and while it’s a learning curve it’s very easy to learn. 

Beyond being a viable currency for addiction treatment we have some other very exciting projects that can be read about on our black paper at https://recoverycoin.fund/recovery-coin-cryptocurrency-black-paper/.

I wanted to put this out to the group to let you know what I’m working on, but also because a lot of you have become awesome friends. If you want to invest in the project it launches Friday and we do have a presale available for individuals who are like-minded.

As always please don’t invest anything you can’t afford to lose and definitely do your own research.

I've been taking Suboxone for some time now (Currently on 6 mg a day spread out into 3 doses between 9 A.M. and 3 P.M.) and while I understand the problematic nature of this drug I AM currently tapering down, so I don't want to make this about that. 

The real problem is the uncontrollable itching it causes. The way it works is if I begin scratching any tender part of my body (The crutch of my arms or legs, my face, my groin) the abrasion it causes begins to itch and it creates a nightmarish cycle of slow healing that leads to itching which leads to scratching. It used to be on my face until it moved to my arms and now it's moved to my genitals (The shaft of the penis and the scrotum) I can't masturbate without striping the skin of the small amount of skin that it still has and making things worse.

I generally get around 4 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night because I continuously wake up to scratch it (It's 4:23 A.M. right now and I just want to sleep)

I've tried 2% Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride anti-itch cream, 12.5 mg of Benadryl before bedtime and keeping the area moisturized but nothing works and it's causing so much misery.

I'm desperate and ask anyone who can provide help to please do so. Thank you in advance.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9968794584274292}"
2021-08-05 00:09:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/oy9txf/the_truth_is_that_i_struggle_to_develop/,The truth is that I struggle to develop meaningful relationships. It’s almost like Weed is an imaginary friend.,"
I’ve been smoking weed almost everyday for the past 9 almost 10 years, started when I was 15 and now I’m almost 25. The past 8 or so years I have been smoking more and more by myself. I managed to force myself to make it through the day yesterday without picking up. I just ran out and I usually plan so that I have more as soon as I run out. But yesterday I wanted to see if I could make it a day without it. It’s hard when I live in a legal state. I still smoked some leftover keif and had beers but it’s a good step I think. Out of all my addictions, weed has been the hardest to cut, usually only lasting 3-4 days. I use it as a ritual every night and in the morning to help me stay motivated.

I ended up caving in tonight as my dealer just re-upped again. It’s not ideal but I realized that I make the biggest realizations on those sobering nights. I couldn’t wait to reup again, until the hours before meeting up. As soon as my dealer confirmed a time, I felt a sense of panic and sadness. When I withdrew the cash for weed, I felt shame and disappointment. 

I have this overwhelming fear sometimes that I can’t make significant changes in my life while smoking. This is especially true regarding relationships. I come from a toxic family, so I’m not very close to any of them. I haven’t had a close friend in years. The majority of my relationships seem superficial. I still have fun with them, but I feel like they’d cancel for better plans. All in all weed has made me feel like a complete and total outcast.

I just watched a YouTube video, the guy talks about teens not having meaningful relationships due to social media. He talked about their lack of meaningful relationships. He talks about how teens will turn to devices rather than people when they face stress in life. I couldn’t help but liken this theory with weed, Ive always turned to weed instead of people when I’m stressed.

They like to call it Mary Jane making it seem like a lover. They even say it’s like a friend who’s always there. But let’s be honest, it’s just a plant. It’s like an imaginary friend that makes me feel comfortable being lonely. I’d rather be with a plant than people. This just seems pathetic as hell.

But I’m 25 now and I don’t have many close relationships. I sometimes think it’s too late, which makes me smoke more. I think what’s the point, it’s not like I have any close friends. The worst is that still hung around people this summer, but I still felt lonely. It felt like I wasn’t connecting with them as I was high, I was just there. 

Now I sit here alone with a quad of weed. I just spent half my paycheck so it’s hard to just toss it. And the worst part is that I still enjoy it. I want to tell myself that I can still smoke and live a meaningful life but it hasn’t happened yet. They say insanity is doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results, which basically sums up my experience with weed.

I just graduated college and I was able to avoid smoking every day because I became an alcoholic. I’d almost rather drink alcohol l than weed, as it doesn’t affect my state of mind in the same way. But I went through some struggles with alcohol and cocaine during parties, so now I’m back on weed as a way to be safer. I’m not getting in trouble anymore and have less bad energy around me than those drugs. I can’t say that’s a bad idea, but it’s hard going back to a substance you’ve been on for years, even if it’s to quit a more dangerous drug.

I’m probably going to smoke the rest of this because I’ve had a terrible week. But I want to start thinking of a plan, so as soon as I run out I don’t get more. Because most of the times I relapsed from not having a plan. I still kept most of my paraphernalia and it just made things harder. I think I need to find a hobby that will make me feel happy without substances. Because I haven’t made much time for hobbies, weed has been my only pastime outside of going out with friends or working.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9887596368789673}"

i love them for getting me to open up when nothing else ever has, for the brief rush of euphoria when i feel like i'm on top of the world, for turning me into a social butterfly, for making me more productive and helping me create more art than i ever have in my life. for giving me the energy to put together wacky outfits and bedazzle everything in the house with rhinestones and sing like nobody is listening and so on and so on. 

but i fucking hate the comedown. 

i fear it every second of every day. when the high wears off and i'm left feeling so empty and devoid of meaning...i'm not coming down but i am having a panic attack right now because i've been left alone with my thoughts for too long. i haven't slept. i was up all night on the drugs. my next dose today will hopefully carry me through until i can fall asleep tonight. i really can't rely on alcohol for another nights' sleep because i've gained too much weight off it already. i've started like 13 different projects tonight (and finished maybe 3 of them, my mind is moving so much faster than my body can), so at least i won't have any unfinished business to tend to tonight. unless my brain decides there is more to do, as it typically does.

i'm so hungry but i'm also so conscious of the feeling of my physical form right now. namely, how it's 15 pounds heavier than it was a few months ago. i have bulimia and i'm triggered every day to relapse. 

the drugs very rarely give euphoria or focus anymore. they just give me debilitating panic attacks, anxiety, paranoia, existential dread. existential crises so severe i have to curl up and cry in a ball on the floor sometimes, and i'm a man. i typically go 2-3 days without sleeping, get drunk, binge on pizza or snack food and then pass out. i'm living my dream life right now. i room with my best friend and i'm surrounded by people who love me. i have everything i could possibly want in the world, clothes that are worth more than our rent because i've picked up a bad theft habit, and i live without a care in the world about my own safety or a roof over my head or food or gas. and i'm throwing it all away because i crave the dopamine release. i am terrified that i'm going to ruin my life this way but i cannot comprehend stopping the drug abuse without fully relapsing back into my alcoholism and bulimia.

I’m a Russian living in Germany… don’t want to endorse stereotypes here but I‘ve been exposed to alcohol since I was a little kid is what I’m trying to say here (parents, family friends etc.). When I was 13 years old me and my friends snuck out a bottle of Wodka on New Year’s Eve and drank it together. This was the first time I was drunk. Regular drinking started when I was 14. Alcohol is extremely easy to get here. From then on it was basically drinking and partying every weekend with a few exceptions where I didn’t drink for 3 to 4 weeks but I always end up going back. The only reason I drank at parties was because I always was more the antisocial type and alcohol made it easier for me to socialize with new people. Right now I’m 18 years old, turning 19 soon. Since those times I never really stopped drinking. The maximum in those whole 4 years of not drinking at least every weekend since I really started was 2 months in one go. Recently I noticed tho that it gets harder to say no, even on weekdays. Whenever I get it offered I always take at least 2 drinks. I’ve hit a new low by drinking 3 to 4 times a week. Of course not drinking till being drunk everytime but still. Sometimes I even feel like I don’t need it. I used to drink to socialize, then because I liked being drunk and right now… I don’t know to be honest. I’m not the type to drink alone though, never did that not even a beer. I’d love to say that I feel completely good and fine without alcohol but something inside of my mind tells me that’s wrong.
Anybody here with experience who can tell me if this is just too much? Should I reduce my consumption or maybe just stop in General? I know alcohol is no joke. My friends tell me it’s fine but I needed to hear some strangers thoughts on this.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9933457374572754}"

Yes, a repeating pattern of this for years now, with different guys.

7+ years ago she had life passions, that have slowly been forgotten. She's even become petty and mean-spirited after all these experiences. She calls me every other week to update me, at length and repetitively, on the miserable details, but is obviously uninterested in me or my life otherwise.

I'm letting go because I'm finally coming to accept that my closest friend from years ago is gone. But I'm holding on to the hope that maybe,  years from now, she'll round a corner and come alive again, move past this addictive, obsessive pattern. Amidst the support I've tried being honest with her over the years, but she insists her patterns aren't concerning. Even after checking herself into an outpatient clinic, she came out unchanged.

Looking for more information.,"I’ve been trying to search for articles or information on Google that talk about high-functioning cocaine addicts (what my partner is) who also then use Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine, an ADHD medication that’s a derivative of amphetamine) to sustain themselves through the week. He’s very wealthy, hyper-productive, super successful in his career and has a strong network of social relationships so it’s difficult to to see him as an addict.

I recently moved in with him (over a month ago) and have realized that he might very well be having addiction issues based on his 10am weekend coke binges, his aggression towards me, irritability towards me, and much more. In the past when I’ve tried to talk to him about him possibly being addicted to cocaine, he outright denies it. I’ve also spoken to a couple of his closest friends about this and they already know that he has an addiction issue.

The challenge is that living in Toronto, this lifestyle is so common that people struggle to or are reluctant to identify it as “addiction”.

I would love any helpful information, resources, or words of support/affirmation from you to better understand what’s going on.

This morning she went off on me, claiming I had lied about something, she then told me I was both not doing enough to help her out on her rental repairs, and also manipulating her to make her dependent on me. The reason I had not helped her as much was to not make her dependant on me, she has plenty of other friends, and (had) worked as a handyman herself.  


She told me her friends had been saying this and now she believes it.  Also brought up a bunch of little things that have never been an issue but I guess make me a bad person today.    


She has gone as far as to change her number, and as she lives next door, I assume she won't be staying there any longer.  I'm devastated, I thought I was always a good friend to her, I always tried to help her out, always tried to support her, even if I didn't like the outcome.

I was in a great place. Then my mom passed in January 2020, just as I was preparing to move out of state. It started with me smoking weed again, then met a girl who was really great I smoked with. I started to stumble, but seeing my son every couple weeks really kept me in a good place. Then March 2020 came with covid. Less and less I got to see him and I really started drifting back into that familiar dark place. I was really clingy with my girlfriend, I didn’t want to be alone and tempted to use. I couldn’t tell her that, it’d freak her out. So I struggled and I relapsed with Xanax. I found a prescription bottle at my parents and it was over. My behavior became true to a relapsed addict, I’m so ashamed. I pushed everyone who cared so far away. I was then using oxy’s along with Xanax and Alcohol. All in silence. I just stopped caring. My girlfriend broke up with me in February, and the wheels came off. It resulted in me being psychiatrically hospitalized after an incident where I destroyed my car, and got into an altercation with two officers. They saw the addiction, I pleaded them to not release that info. The last three or four weeks though things have really changed. I hate the hurt I caused to my family, ex, and friends.

John 9:2-7 (KJV)  And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.

Too much shit went down to where porn/fapping/sex all of it ruined my career.

Now I'm much older and thinking about the past shows how much porn has ruined my life next to that experience.

These urges I get to fap are ridiculous to me because I literally don't want to fap, but as soon as something happens to where I feel slight upset, or something is bothering me, I scurry off to a website and watch porn. Even after I'm done doing my business, I'm literally sad because I think about my future, I think about future relationships and I want to be normal but I also don't want to be involved with someone if I'm mentally just drained from all of this. I don't want to be a burden to someone else so these have been my thoughts for the past year.

ARTIST STATEMENT: 

addiction is like there’s an intelligent, sentient,being inside me fighting to survive. it evolves and manipulates to become stronger and stronger. it adapts. 
it adapts so well that it becomes unclear who I am or where the boundaries are between me and the disease. 
My sense of self is ruptured. 

In these images, I have dissected this rupture 
this rift 
this fracture 

I cannot see where I stop and the disease starts 

Instead I see

Ecstasy and Agony. Grabbing. Craving, Aching, Swallowing. Traces of Fear. Delusion and Intoxication. Chemicals, Layers. Distance. Pushing and Pulling. Scratching, Ripping, Puncturing, Dissolving. Restricting and Indulging. Omissions. Jitters, Shakes,, Fevers. Repulsion and Disgust. Repetition, Ritual, Habit, Pattern. Emptiness and Saturation. A Hijacking. A Parasite. A Numb Drip. Glamour and Glory. Shame. A Bitter Taste. A Facade of Volition. Creases, Ridges, Details. A Hypnotically Assaultive Longing. Collapsed Space. Something Being Chased That Cannot Be Caught. Escape and Demise. A Sinister Curtain. Amplifying and Obstructing. Melting. Sitting in a Circle. “Wanting”. Submitting Dutifully and Compulsively. Potent. Pleasure Then Maintenance. Lapse. Split. Denial and Delirium. Involuntary Rivalry. Eviction. Indulgence. The Precipice. A Mirage. Vicious Thirst. A Mind Of Its Own. Voices in Disguise. Lodged and Latched. An Impenetrable Surface. 

 The disease is not just bleeding into me, I am bleeding into it. 

Addiction is insidious.
(gradual, subtle, harmful, crafty, cunning, stealthy, sneaky, tricky)
The disease manages to split yourself into two.
    The “good” true self is rational, self aware, and cares about life.
    The “bad” cares only only about getting high.
It will achieve at any cost.
Disease can rationalize anything, constantly convincing me to lie or hide things, anything to maintain its existence. 
The addict mind is extremely intelligent and can sense when it is being attacked.
When an external force or the good brain attempts to dismantle the bad, something like an alarm goes off that makes the disease fear for its own existence. With this panic, it manages to grow even stronger, it fights back, it spreads faster.
Sometimes the insidious side works without the good side even noticing.
It is constantly tricking you into thinking you have all the control when you dont at all.
There's definitely no control.
The disease has a mind of its own.
The biggest trick of all is it's smart enough to convince you it's all that exists, that it's taken over completely. It's constantly compromising and renegotiating with itself.
Truly opposing forces occupying the same space.
Once it convinces you it's taken over, you lose hope and then become tricked into thinking you became the disease. You are the disease. 
You are the vessel, the host, where the disease thrives and maintains control.
The good side can be very aware of all this, but the more you try to fight it, the more the bad side will retaliate and strengthen its grip on you.
You would think being aware of all this would somehow solve things, but somehow the awareness itself gets tricked into believing the bad side is too intelligent to be diminished. 
It’s scary because it's a literal voice disguised as you.
So you get tricked again into thinking it is you.
It's very easy to surrender to yourself when the addict mind has the power to convince you of anything that will aid in its growth and takeover.
It's smart enough to know when to hide, therefore convincing you it doesnt have too much power.
It's smart enough to convince you that living with it possessing you is manageable.
It's smart enough to convince you that anyone who tries to stop you from using will never understand you

My name is Ethan. I've been in recovery for 8 months now and have been in and out of addiction. I used to share on Reddit almost every day of my struggles. You guys helped me get to 63 days where I was then brought back into active addiction by a relapse. In these months without reddits I ended up totaling two cars in one day off percs(my drug of choice) and overdosing a few times on Xanax. Also spent 30 days in rehab. I finally feel ready to change. After all, I'm putting everything on the line. For me not to be clean and sober would mean a 6-month facility and a complete change of school systems. Now, this isn't what is keeping me sober but is hopefully something to be able to think about before relapse. Right now I have 48 days clean and 109 days off the percs. Even though I feel like I have so long off the percs(longest ever) they are still the thing I constantly desire. I am on naltraxone. Which makes it easier to not use them knowing that I would essentially feel nothing and it would be a waste of money and considered a relapse. But, I'm hanging in there and with all of your support, I'm feeling really good about it. I'm also getting back on my sobriety website and promoting that to share with addicts all over the world.

(I realize this can be a triggering statement, so please don't behead me.)

I know so many people who are amazing human beings at their core but have addictions that make it nearly impossible to move forward in life. Most addicts have the hugest hearts but are just too damaged, codependent, or caught up in all their big-hearted emotions and so they keep running back to their numbing substance.

Trust me, I know this, which makes the whole situation of loving one, or being one even more tragic in my opinion. But addictions and the lasting effects of prior addiction can really take a toll. Including dealing with relapses, or the fear of. Or even just being responsible, and motivated enough to get ahead financially and build a life with someone, after years of squandered opportunities (ie: college, obtaining criminal records, etc).

And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
