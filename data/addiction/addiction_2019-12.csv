History: Severe depression and social anxiety growing up and I didnt fit in either. I had a lot of issues that continued to get worse throughout middle school and culminating in high school. I was self medicating to get through the day. In senior year I was sneaking out 1-2 times a day to get high, already after coming to school high. 

I graduated and still used occasionally but not every day like before, and not as much at once either... I got a possession ticket and to get it adjudicated I needed to go to treatment. I was labeled as an addict because of my behaviors and I didnt really question it. I was ready to stop using so I listened and started going to NA. 

My sobriety date was 9/13. I have used since then occassionally. Just alcohol. It started with not wanting full-on as-needed anxiety meds because I didnt want them to hook me or be impacted for hours per dose. I got a beer and gave myself less than an ounce. This eventually became less strenuous and I could easily buy more than one beer at a time to save myself trips and I'd store them in smaller containers so that I wouldn't waste 7/8 of a beer every time I needed to chill. 

This has progressed to me being comfortable with alcohol in general. I have liquor in the house and dont use it more than once every couple weeks, about a shot (in a mixed drink) each time I pull it out. These uses are just for social/pleasure.

I honestly dont see a fair comparison between my situation and the stories I hear about people relapsing once and going haywire until they get in trouble. 

I've been semi-consistently ""relapsing"" for about 3 years and I've never gone off the rails. 

The hard thing is that once you're labeled crazy or an addict, everything you do is seen as a rationlization and somehow fits the diagnosis.

Question: With an open mind, would you say I'm an ""addict"", ""previously dependent and no longer so"", or ""other"". Please explain (blue/big book thumping will be ignored. I want reason not dogma)",2

I believe he hasn't had a drink in several months now, but he abuses all his other medications (adhd and anxiety meds), he goes through my stuff looking for my meds as well.  When he runs out, he looks for people to buy them from.  Like most people with adhd, he also has impulse control issues.
We have 2 young children and when he goes on these benders he's up all night,  misses work in the morning,  and becomes paranoid.  I can no longer trust him.  He also owns several guns.
He has spent a lot of our money, but I dont know where.  This, combined with the lies and addiction, and the lack of acceptance or willingness to seek treatment for addiction, have now led me to want to leave him.

I really like gaming, or reading a book online, or series/youtube binge watching, or basically just spending time on the internet. To be honest, I spend time on it a bit too much, and I feel it's leading to unhealthy side effects( bad posture, eye sight worsening/they are constantly red even though I wear anti blue UV lights) and I kinda wanna change, its just that everything else gives me major anxiety.

Gym: For starters the gym: The local gyms are proliferated with people I genuinely do not like, major douches to be exact, if I ever want to workout, I want to go to places that honestly people do NOT know me. I get huge major anxiety from other people constantly judging. The thing is that all other gyms are really far, and thus the prices for a membership+gasoline will be too high, so I REALLY don't want to go there with them

Other Hobbies: I'm considering reading by buying books rather online, today I went, but ow god.... the prices were insane, and TBH I feel like I should have a hobby that does NOT include me straining my eyes even more.

Relationships: So my friends from highschool are all dispersed, and the ones who remained are really annoying and rude. I do have one friend, but he tends to isolate himself from everyone, and I do feel I should spend more time with him, but his activities include also gaming, or going somewhere very costly.. I feel like if I do go to him, I'd end up spending money even more(also he dropped out from college and is using his money for basically leisure). My University friends are also very dispersed, and are mostly female rather male.... and so I kinda feel I need to build more relationships with them, but like I'm almost going to be graduated, so it's lowkey late.

Weather: It's freezing cold right now, so I'm spending most of my time at home, so for killing time I'm straining my eyes even more.

So yeah I'm in a pickle, what do you recommend to solve this addiction.",2

This might seem like a little thing but If you know addiction well you’ll get why this is something bad for me. 

Like the title say I’ve kinda had a relapse, I’ve been clean since the middle of February and I found kratom  awhile ago and started to use it to battle my anxiety. A doctor gave me lyrica for that years ago and I thought kratom could help me to not get addicted to the pills (which I’m not and never been, since the beginning I’ve only taken it to sleep and have had regular times when I’m of). 

I thought I would use kratom responsible and only to battle anxiety. Since it’s such a mild high compared to other things I thought it to be not a big deal, but you know how it goes. One evening becomes a whole day, one day becomes 2 and so on. I’ve had weeks I’ve been on it entire days and then been of for a week so I’m not addicted to it (200% honest guys, there’s no point to lie to you or myself). 

But I’ve noticed the same patterns as before, I go into myself, daydream about beautiful things to escape dealing with my life, I forget to eat, shower and take care of myself. It’s not nearly as bad as with alcohol, weed or speed that was my primary choice of drugs for nearly 6 years. But it’s the same pattern and MO. 


I’ve decided to quit, and I guess I just wanted to free my chest and get some encouragement from you guys. Because it feels like no matter what I do I’ll always gonna be like this, 10 months of drugs and I use something that barely get you high (compared to other things again) and it takes 2-3 weeks to fall into the same old patterns. I also smoke a lot more cigarettes and drinks an unholy amount of coffee. Tame compared to weed and amphetamine but once again it’s the same pattern. 

Fucking damn it, I don’t wanna be like this, I hate myself so much for being like this, it’s so fucking hard to resist going into drugs and taking care of things. I mean It’s hard to fucking eat, how can it be so hard to eat like a normal fucking human being? Why is it so hard to fucking shower? 

I feel so pathetic right now it’s insane, but fucking damn it I’m gonna quit kratom. Then smoking, I want to be free again. Sorry for the rant guys, just need to tell someone and get some encouragement to keep me on the right path.",0

My last relapse started out about a year ago with a bump of heroin and I was in back into active addiction. I thought I had it under control cause for about four months I would use it only about every 3rd day and i wasnt getting sick, well real sick. Not to mention that when I got my shit from anywhere else than the one guy I would get fentanyl without knowing what it was and I would do it and OD. Anyways to make a long story short I crashed 2 cars lost alot of things that I acquired in the time i was sober switched from the heroin and replaced it with cocaine and alcohal. I'm at the end of my run now because i was found out by my brother and he turned me in to my parents that i live with at the moment and they are giving me an ultimatum to either go to treatment or leave the house. I know what the right thing to do is and i guess I'm gonna do it, i just feel like shit over everything cause i havent yet right out and told my people the truth and admitted to my actions.

Only 3 days ago I decided I need to ‘get over’ my codeine addiction. Addiction started with prescriptions for chronic pain, something I’ve battled with for 9 years. I think we all know how quickly and scarily it can spiral. Went from a panadeine forte to a few, to endone and then oxy, to targin on a daily, never sober always chasing the high all the while telling myself it was to help the pain. It wasn’t. I finally admitted it to myself about 2 weeks ago and have been battling my own brain, smashing down anything whenever I can ‘before I get clean’. My boyfriend and I finally had a discussion about it - I brought it up. He’s helping me, he’s been an angel through the last few days. I haven’t taken an endone or oxy since Friday, despite cravings. But I have allowed myself up to 4 panadeine forte to try and slowly bring it down (learnt just how dependant I was on day 1 when all of the withdrawal symptoms kicked in). 
Anyway, that’s the backstory. 

What I need help with right now, is I’m going through an extremely painful flare, I’ve had 5 panadeine forte to try take the edge off with no help. I’m hardly able to move and at a point wheee I would usually consider hospital (where they dose me up on morphine - not exactly what I need or want right now) 

Is it going to be detrimental to my detox/recovery if I do take just one endone to try and reduce pain? I’m at wits end, I’m hurting to a point I can’t stand or move, I’ve collapsed from pain already. I don’t know what else to do.",2

At this very moment 365 days ago I was in such a dark place that life seemed pointless. In 9 hours a year will have passed since when I check into inpatient care. It sucked I hated life I was in mental and physical pain but I kept pushing. I went to IOP and I was lucky enough to meet other teens who were succeeding in their path towards recovery. After ten weeks of IOP I graduated from the program and was on my own. I started going to a adolescent sober living group and met people who instilled the idea of long term sobriety into my head. It was sunshine and rainbows for six months I believe in AA/NA they call that pink cloud. Around the six month mark I found out that a close friend of mine from IOP was in jail, a week later another one was missing, a few days later one was in the hospital and finally the last kid from my original group killed himself. It was just me. I was the last one standing, the ones I looked up to as role modes failed and I struggled. But I found my passion in music again and was able to focus on people who don’t struggle with substance abuse and who support me and my journey. I found my way out of the first year and found that this is what I want to do with my life, adolescent substance abuse counseling. I am grateful for the year mark but also humbled by those I started this journey with and who aren’t with me now. Every second is a conflict, every minute a fight, every hour a battle, and everyday a war. And I will fight this for the rest of my life and I will win.

2019-12-29 10:07:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/eh6w1n/drug_addiction_help/,Drug Addiction Help,"The Addicted Brain

Psychiatrists try and manipulate people and tell them that they have various different disorders in order to get them hooked on drugs. That is their only so-called “tool” that they use in practice. They don't offer any solutions; instead, they administer drugs, drugs, and more drugs.

Psychiatrists are trying to push a theory of the “addicted brain.” This theory suggests that somehow the brain is different for a person who is using drugs. However, if you actually have a sample of what an addictive brain looks like, you should also be able to have a sample of what a non-addictive brain looks like. No such evidence exists. There is no proof or scientific validity to this theory. In fact, there's nothing about psychiatry that is scientific.

Before anybody starts using substances, they usually have a perfectly normal brain, they function, they're happy, they're productive, they do things in life. After they start using drugs, the chemicals do change their brain. But this is done by any chemical; it doesn't matter if it's legal or not. Legal or illegal, the brain can't tell the difference.

Don't listen to psychiatry and their lies. They have a lot of made-up disorders with no solutions. Every time you see a psychiatrist, they're going to give you a prescription. And if you go to five different psychiatrists, you'll get five different prescriptions because there is no scientific backing to their research and claims, only opinions. They lie to your face and push their harmful drugs on innocent people.

' Go to AA/NA meetings' seems to be the standard response when anyone is trying to escape addiction. A lot of the time it's the ONLY response people will give to someone asking for help or expression frustration with recovery. I've seen many people insinuate you are destined to fail in recovery if you don't attend these meetings.

I understand that these places have done immense good for many people, I don't thing AA and NA should stop being suggested entirely or anything...... it's just frustrating,,, especislly when it's the only answer you seem to get when asking for advice or thoughts.

From what I gather, AA and NA have a focus on religion........ religion (or rather, religious people, specifically christians) makes me deeply, deeply, deeply uncomfortable, even afraid, because of personal trauma related reasons. I've seen people say that AA and NA can help you even if you dont buy into religious thinking, but I know my extreme aversion to and discomfort with it will stop me from being able to work with it. 

I also know there's people who just aren't helped by the ""steps"", and not for lack of effort,,, And, while people say the meetings/steps can help you even if you're addicted to something other than alcohol or narcotics..... I'm sure it *can*, but I feel like I would feel isolated, and embarrassed to be there. There would be some serious differences in our experiences, things I wouldnt be able to relate to them on and things they wouldnt be able to relate with me on....... y'know??

I dunno. I kind of wish there were more widely available resources/groups out there for non-religious people, for people with behavioural addictions..... ect,,",5

I'm 23 today, staying with my girlfriend, she's not very well so we're having a fairly relaxed one. She's 7 months + 6 days sober from alcohol today and I'm 2 weeks clean from codeine, 3 weeks clean from Valium. Every day is an achievement, and she still sees it the same way with hers even though its been so much longer. 

She's been especially struggling with it recently but I'm so so proud of what she's managed to do it's insane and gives me so much strength. I've known her through the entire thing as we were friends when we were younger and I always thought she was amazing but even more so now. If you can do it for yourself you'll begin to the see the impact it has on the people around you. You can be happier, so why not try? 

Feels great to have control over things (at least a lot more than I did), I still crave codeine + valium pretty hard, was using codeine 800mg/day + Valium 100mg/day together alongside some drinking/smoking and occasionally other things. I have moments of weakness where I consider using or indulge the fantasy in my head but I haven't acted on it yet, which is good. Hoping to try and keep going down this path so I can live a happier life and choose what I do with it rather than let my DoCs choose for me.

My case- 
Me 60, married almost 40 yrs. Wife does weed. Couple of well adjusted kids and their kids. I worked at same company over 30 years in a good job where I excelled. Never did drugs at work and never fooled with a.neetle. 

I had several surgeries where the doctors just about handed me the script pad including a pain management dr who gave me 150 5mg oxy's, 90 xan's and 90 flexerills for over 7 years while the surgeons were giving me get over surgery pills. Top that out with the pills w refills  multiple Dr's were giving me for anything. Along getting them off friends. I haven't be wo for over  30 years.  One Dr didn't know what the other was writing. 

I assume with either Sublocade or Suboxone, they will want me off xanax, flexerill and alcohol. Is this correct? That will be extremely difficult for me. 

That's just to give you an idea of the level of my addiction for 30 years along with alcohol for 40+ years. 

Going to meetings is going to be difficult also. I have an older brother who has been going to AA for 35+ yrs. I took him. But he now makes swipes at every opportunity. He had always been jealous of every aspect of my life - job, marriage, family, on and on. It  been like that our whole life. My mother (an RN) has always said I was a functioning alcoholic which is true. But I never gotten a DUI, wrecks, etc. I have no problem handing my wife the keys. 

I am proud of my brother's 35 years of sobriety but if I were at a meeting with him, he'd shout about it from the the rooftops even though I have never shown nothing but pride in his sobriety. 

Now that I've covered me. On to the questions-
-Will I have to take urine test regularly?
-Do I have to attend meetings?
-Will I have to quit everything?
-Which has the greater success rate?
-Will either reflect on drivers license?

I'm sure you will want to point to the on line user guides but I have disease that showed up a few years ago that makes compression difficult to impossible for me.

This is a post specifically made to allow questions to be asked, to somebody who is (in fact) a bottom of the barrel, kick your door in, steal your gramma's jewelry, heroin addict.

A very quick backstory (and I wont be giving my lead): I'm 22, M, and currently 8 (almost 9) months clean and sober from all mood altering substances. I currently am signed under a contract with the Recovery Kentucky Center that I completed, attempting to help other addicts and potential alcoholics that are sent through the same wringer that I went through. I made a post in r/ legal advice (which I will attempt to find) almost a year ago which somewhat summed up my mindset and situation that my actions had put me in, thus resulting in the commonwealth of Kentucky sending me to said center. There have been many changes in these 8-9 months, and am currently happier and content with my life than I have ever been. I have found no reason to use or drink any substances, as I have no fucking reason to do so anymore. 

Again, I am a fucking junkie, that has recovered from a hopeless state of mind and body, please ask any questions needed, and I will do my best to answer them honestly.",2

You’re my husband, now you’re not,
You’re cold, or you’re hot.

You’re mad, now you’re gone,
One person at dusk, another at dawn.

You were found, now you’re lost,
You keep going, no matter the cost.

We were winning, now we’re not,
This rollercoaster hurts a lot.

You’re lying, I know you’re caught,
Don’t say I didn’t try to help you, for you I always fought.

Found the straws, might as well stab me,
It hurts so bad, I can’t be happy.

Carrying your daughter, carrying the weight,
You said you controlled your demon, you said you were straight.

How can you be my rock when you’re breaking,
How can we thrive when we’re barely maintaining?

All the excuses, all the pain,
Money: that too goes down the drain.

I’m scared, I’ve lost hope,
Every relapse: to you is it all a joke?

It’s driving me crazy,
To know you haven’t stopped for the babies.

Can’t you see your habits haunt me,
Can’t you see the damage it’s causing?

I love you so much, it fucking kills me,
To know I don’t really have you with me.

You get high and I get angry,
You get high and then you blame me.

I’ve begged for change, therapy and healing,
You deny and talk about leaving.

I feel cheated on, you love those little pills,
All the mountains that grew from molehills.

Maybe it’s not as bad as it was,
But can’t you completely give up the drugs?

I’ve fought to save you from the things you do,
I injured myself, trying to help you.

I know I can’t make you stay sober,
Will you stop if it’s sober or over?

Would it stop you if you saw me leaving,
Would you care if the wounds I carry were bleeding?

I tried to be the sun and moon,
I tried it all, and it broke me too soon.

I’ve lost my cool, this shit has changed me,
Addiction isn’t just your battle baby.

Mine is you, and trying to clean up the mess,
Mine is you, and trying to ignore the stress.

Even when my soul is begging,
For me to stop the damage.. and let there be an ending.",46

I have very little will power so one line leads to another and the next thing my alarm is going off for work and I haven’t slept a minute despite having a high profile, stressful job which regularly tests for drugs and alcohol. My last job I was regularly taking cocaine at work as I felt like I was more productive but in reality I was falling behind on all my projects and eventually quit.

I wouldn’t say I suffer from alcohol addiction but my cravings for cocaine go through the roof when I drink, I actually can’t remember the last time I drank and didn’t use cocaine.

I’m laid in bed this morning after cancelling plans with family and friends. I have spent over $400 over the last 3 days and all I have to show for it is a couple of empty bags next to my bed. I can’t imagine how disappointed my family would be to see me now.

I thought I’d post here to show anyone who feels like they’ll never get out that you are understood, accepted, and that there will always be hope for you.","I posted this in response to someone asking why anyone would ever try something they knew was so scary, dangerous,  and addictive (specifically, heroin in this case):


>Just about any of us that have ever done it said that at one point. You just gradually sink deeper into that world until it no longer seems like a big deal. Slowly but surely, everyone you know is in on it. People you never would have associated with are your close friends. The non-addicts become the aliens. And it becomes so easy to justify shit you would have thought unthinkable, especially to get more drugs. Your life becomes immensely more miserable and disgusting, but there’s a sick beauty and relief to the simplicity of that duality of being high, or desperately, single-mindedly, trying to get high. You’re living in two worlds: the one where the gravity of your situation is crashing down upon you, and the one where you’ve gotten high, and you feel like you’re who you’re supposed to be, that your broken life is amazing, your miserable friends are amazing, and all those pipe dreams you have will somehow come true. Then suddenly you’ve been up on meth for the better part of a week grinding your teeth and trying not to pull out your eyes, and you can hardly recognize yourself or remember how the fuck it got like this. (I’m so lucky that that was the point where I came to terms with what I’d become and started making changes.) Never underestimate how that shit can creep into your life.


Some of you have been in the darkest part of the fight for far longer than I was. My real issues began at 17, and my recovery began before my 20th birthday. I cannot assume to understand your struggle, but I can share my experience for those of you who are young and trying to see a future without addiction.


Out of deep emotional pain which I won’t burden you with, in my first semester of college I jumped from weed and alcohol, to *heavy* cocaine use, to Xanax, codeine, and anything else I could force up my nose or down my throat, all while fostering a deeply toxic romantic relationship. I gradually abandoned all of my passions, ambitions, and values. I flunked out of college and began working construction. I was lost and stupid and still in an abusive relationship, looking to medicate what felt like a brain and soul intent on ending itself. I shot Opana for the first time that summer, and I was hooked. For months I spent every single paycheck on those pills before finding that I could get heroin for cheaper. From there, I made progressively older, depraved, and amoral friends, and did things I could never have imagined of myself. Mistreating my wonderful mom and brother, stealing from friends, my company, and my family. enabling others, sharing needles, and abusing anything I could find. 


This ended in a 3 day meth binge, which until that point had been some sort of arbitrary line I’d drawn to convince myself I wasn’t a *real* junkie, I just liked to “play.”


When I finally went home to come down, I found a personal hell of self loathing, psychosis, and terror. 


For hours I tried to keep myself from scratching my eyes out and grinding my mouth into a bloody mess. My whole body spazzed and cramped for hours and I really thought I was going crazy for good. 


Finally, to find some small relief, I started writing. I wrote every terrible thing about myself I could think of. But then, every good thing I had left, and ever had. And then I began writing what I must do to change. 


It took another 2 weeks to begin taking action, but I couldn’t forget what I’d written. I finally threw away everything I had stashed. Deleted every number I’d gotten in the last couple years, and started taking care of myself. Dumped the girlfriend, started going to therapy, and got back in the gym (I go at least 5 times a week and it’s incredible how much stability it can provide). Of course, I’m still tempted, and it’s a pretty rigorous daily maintenance situation. 


But I’m back in school (though, at a less prestigious school and with zero scholarship) as well as working full time to pay my way. I’m learning about what I love, staying engaged with the friends I had before I started using as well as new ones. I’ve picked back up with music and other passions I thought I’d lost. 


I cut out that girlfriend, and have been working to make myself and my health a top priority.


I’m still pulled to slip back into that dark place, because misery is comfortable in a way. I still think about the drugs often. The worst thing about them is they actually DO work for that little moment, and chasing that fleeting but intense relief and reward is always tempting. 


But for anyone who can’t see how there could be anything left of them to salvage, you’re not as far away from a life you’ll be proud to live as you think. 


Much love, everyone. And feel free to DM if you need someone to talk to.",26

After that I began to notice little things in there speech and behaviors like, “I can’t live without this” or “I can’t function without that”. They won’t go to a nutritionist because “he will just tell me I can’t eat this food anymore”. 

I may be an ass by posting this here but this smells an awful lot like addiction. Reason is met with disregard and concerns met with lies. I don’t want to watch this person suffer for something preventable or worse watch them eat themselves into an early grave.

My S.O of 4 years relapsed about over a year and a half ago (heroin), after finding out about it a year ago, I told him he needs to get clean and start his recovery. That didn’t happen because he didn’t want to, I want to believe his addiction has taken over and that it’s not him. 
He was a very different person when I first met him. Ready  and excited for the future, patient, ambitious, happy, disliked the idea of being fucked up. But that’s all completely changed now. 

He has completely lost himself, or I’m just seeing the true him.. i don’t even know at this point and it hurts to say that because both of us were truly best friends at a point. 

Still after everything I know I love this man and I just want to see him happy and healthy again.. 

So after a year of  fighting, waiting, breaking up on and off, and all the other bad, he moved to another state to be with family. We always planned on moving and starting our lives together, but he couldn’t be in this environment anymore and I don’t blame him. Trying long distance is hard, especially with his state of mind and my own now. 
He wants me to move in with him, but I feel like it’s only because he’s depressed and lonely not because he wants to build a future together.
I still want a life with him but only if he gets 100% sober. 
I believe once he’s sober for a while he will know what he really wants..
He tells me that drinking and smoking weed aren’t a problem for him and never have been. 
But I believe he’s in denial, he is a full blown addict. From heroin, roxys, coke, and whatever other drugs he’s doing that I’m unaware of.. 

I feel selfish for asking anyone to do something they clearly don’t want to, but this is my life too right? I know he lies to me to keep me happy or to not get himself in trouble with me, I’m blind to it because I want to trust him again. I can’t be so naive and ignorant anymore though. 

Is it wrong of me to tell him I think he’s in denial and he needs to take his recovery more seriously if we’re going to be able to move forward.. 
does anyone here think he might be in denial about his addiction? 
How does someone breakthrough to an addict? 

I’m on my last leg right now. There’s nothing more for me to say to him, we’ve become very closed off from each other. He doesn’t want me to know this side of him and I don’t want to let him in anymore because I don’t know this side of him.. 
maybe I’m the one being in denial about the whole thing, I just need advice please",2

2019-12-26 04:09:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/eftc03/how_i_recover_from_alcohol_addiction/,How I recover from alcohol addiction?," Iwould like to share my experience with you.

Overcoming an addiction to alcohol can be a long and bumpy road. At times, it may even feel impossible. But it’s not. If you’re ready to stop drinking and willing to get the support you need, you can recover from alcoholism and alcohol abuse—no matter how heavy your drinking or how powerless you feel.

I just wanted to run away, and I had no idea what awaited me on the other end of it all. I never thought it was possible to reach that bottom but alcoholism brought me down to my knees and finally, staring at all the wreckage, there were only two choices – let myself go for good, or ask for help.

I checked into a 28-day [Alcohol addiction treatment program](https://www.whyaddicted.com/) at [WhyAddicted](https://www.whyaddicted.com/) in South Africa, Cape Town. That program saved my life. Treatment forced me to see one thing crystal clear – my recovery had to be the most important thing in my life. They say whatever you put ahead of your recovery will be the second thing you lose. I learned that I had to get sober not for other people, or to look good in the face of my wreckage – that I had to get sober for myself. Most importantly, I had to learn that I was worth it.

**What did I do differently at the time of the treatment program?**

Talking to other people who have faced similar things to me and hearing how they’ve moved through and handled the many challenges life presents sober is critical for me. I also do what I can for the newcomer. When I found recovery, I can’t even summarize how significant it was for me to talk to people, tell them what I’d done and then be told to, “keep coming back” and that “this too shall pass.”

**What is the best part of my recovery?**

Today my life is honest and true. I don’t have nearly the material things I once did – but what I have today is a reflection in the mirror that I can look at and feel good about it. The greatest job of recovery is the ability I now have to feel good about the things I do, and the person that I am. I had never felt that before in my life. I get to spend time with my children and be emotionally invested. I get to care for others and be a good friend and a good son. And it’s all genuine and true. I owe all of that to recovery.

I used to be terrified at the idea, but I’ve never felt more relieved and empowered before. I cannot wait to see the changes and improvements in my life.

I'm a father of three girls under ten, husband to the strongest willed person I know, and a fledgling addictions worker in a small city downtown area. I share my time with people who bring fulfillment to my life, so that I may influence them in a positive way too. I don't lose hope when things go sideways, I persevere and come back a stronger person. I cry when I'm sad, I laugh when I'm happy, and I don't need anything in my body to suppress or express those emotions. I love being sober and I love my life.

They say that what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, I found that through struggle, I face planted right into my destiny. Sounds silly right? I'm not a superbly intelligent person, but all I had to do is admit that what I was doing was slowly and surely killing me. No AA or NA here, but the principal within those fellowships apply, namely the first step. Once I stopped the excuses and started to listen, all I had to do is be honest. Honestly share how broken I was. Honestly share how angry I was. Honestly put to practice sober living and reach my potential, or die trying.

I chose working in the addictions field originally because I thought it would be nice to give back, but as I continue to grow in my own recovery, it's so much more than that. 

I've witness a stream of tears run down the face of a man separated from his daughter for four  years finally embrace, because he found the courage to face the fear he had of his own father. 

I've held a mother in my arms as she thanked me for being there for her son after he died of relapse the night before. 

It's all relevant. I was a loser, but now I make a difference. Now I can be part of the solution. 

How did I get here? I stopped asking the world what it can do for me, and started to do what I can for it. We are people who need each other, and I choose love.

Find what you are passionate of, and use it to change the world. We are all powerful, and unique. Be a force for the good of this world. 

Love you all,

My brother is 22, managed to finish high school (he is objectively super smart) but also struggling with crippling social anxiety - not helped by his bad skin and general early twenties uncertainties.   
My mum works in mental health care - which absolutely does not explain why everyone has ignored his condition for the past years. Truth to be told it did not all begin with the gaming. It started with him being a weird kid in general, highly unmotivated, an avid reader though from the age of 6. And then it turned into what it is now - him having serious social anxiety, I think also some eating disorder (he is frightfully thin), ticks (upper body, head, and coughing) and not leaving the house OR doing so after days of consideration.   
His only relationship - as far as we see - is with family members but he would never answer messages e.g., In general, he is like a ghost, living this nocturnal life, not doing much around the house, not attending college (he was accepted to a fairly good institution), having no motivation, seemingly which does not help his relationship with my parents. In any case, as I'm sure you understand, it's a big bowl of crazy-soup...   
He has never seen a professional though who would diagnose him, mostly because my mum has always insisted that he is just fine. By now this is obviously not true. My parents are elderly. He is not going anywhere and especially not to a mental health provider.   
So here I am basically crowdsourcing solutions. Give me your best shot if you are a survivor or currently struggling with (gaming) addiction. Let me know if you experienced anything similar, what helped you. Ask me any questions and please stay non-judgmental. 

Many many thanks in advance.",2
2019-12-25 01:38:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/efd6vv/the_link_between_addiction_adhdadd/,The link between addiction & ADHD/ADD,"This may come across as random, but I strongly urge everyone who has struggled with any drug addiction(s) who can’t seem to stay clean to get checked for ADHD/ADD. I firmly believe that ADHD/ADD is a LOT more common than most people think. There are varying degrees of the condition, and it is very often confused with other conditions. There is an extremely close relationship between ADHD/ADD and addiction. Getting diagnosed and treated for my ADD has made getting clean and staying that way not only possible, but so easy it still shocks and interests me every day.

If you have struggled with addiction and maintaining sobriety, do yourself a favor, look up the symptoms of ADHD as well as ADD, reflect on your life, and see if you can make a mental match. If ADHD/ADD seems to you to answer or make sense of yourself to yourself, make an appointment with a qualified mental health professional with your suspicion. Even if you and the doctor decide it isn’t ADHD/ADD, at least you can say you ruled the potential culprit out.

My life as an addict has all but completely evaporated since my diagnosis, along with life skills therapy and medication. Absolutely no drug cravings, don’t even think about drugs or see how on earth I could have ever been that way. It truly is incredible. Anyone else out there who’s also had this epiphany will relate.

The human mind is an extraordinary thing. Do yourself a kindness and look into it.

I'm in love with an addict. I do not use drugs myself except cigarettes, alcohol, and very occasionally pot. 
I've known this guy for a while, and I've cared deeply about him for some time, but we just recently started seeing each other. About 4 months ago, he had gotten out of jail/rehab. And things seemed to be going well for him. He was staying clean, following his probation, working on a job (he was hired but it's a long starting process) and one day he mentioned he needed money. I had extra so I helped him. Then it became a repeated occurance. A couple times a week I was throwing him money so he could get something to eat, buy some smokes, buy Christmas presents for his kids. Etc. I didn't fully trust him, so I verified as much as possible my money was going where it was supposed to go. Etc ""send me pics of the gifts, receipts for the food, etc"" 
After I started helping him more and more he told me he was bisexual and he liked me. (we are both men, I'm Bisexual myself) and I was very attracted to him and had a thing for him for a while. So we began to see each other more and more. Things are going okay, were spending a good amount of time together. Talking a lot. Smooth sailing. 
Then today he had court and went to jail. 
I spoke with his ex gf, to let her know as they were still friends (weird dynamic between us three) she told me she knew because she was the one who brought him it court. 
On a whim I asked if they were still together. She said they are but aren't. She wasn't sure where they stood, but they were still living together and sleeping together. She filled in some blanks for me, told me she caught him using Herion the other night. I was under the impression Cocaine was his drug of choice. Somehow I liked to pretend that was better. 
She filled me in on a lot of things, explained some stuff I didn't understand, and revealed a lot of lies to me. I bregrudgingly folder her me and him were together.She expressed she thought we were sleeping together, and that she wasn't mad. She's known the beast for years, and that I could talk to her if I needed it. 

My relationship is over for now. I can't be knee deep in all this, I'm just not equipped for it. But I still want to be his friend and support him. But I'm not knowledgeable or familiar with the situation. Is my innocense and naivety just going to damage and enable him more? I've always been the type to try and fix everyone's problems and help everyone that I can. But this might be too much for me. 

TLDR: If I'm not knowledgeable enough to stop myself from enabling an addict, should I still be his friend and support him? Or is it better to walk away and wish him luck?",1

this is my first time here writing on this reddit, and I'd like to share my recent experience in my family. I'm 26 years old, and I've been working as a programmer for more than a year, and I live with my family in Italy.  
My mom and my father stopped loving eachother for quite a while(more than 10 years I'd say) for various reasons, the biggest one is because of my father's addiction to gambling: he always said that he never spent that much, and that he can control himself, but things changed last month.

One day, while I was playing in the evening on my PC, my mom came into my room with some papers(all the movements of the family's bank account), and she showed me something VERY suspicious: a lot of withdraws of money below the minimum(20€), sometimes there were like 15 in just one day, and all of them came from the same BAR in our neighbourhood.

So we started checking all of the previous 6 months my mom had printed, and by calculating JUST those suspicious transactions, we saw more than 12k+ euros missing, and that's without counting the money he could have won and then spent again.

We both knew it was my father's doing, so when he came back home, we confronted him, we didn't insult him or anything, no, we didn't wanna destroy him, he is still part of the family! What we did is just show him that this situation is out of control, and that he needs to go to a therapist, and he agreed. 

I believed my father could be redeemed and that he would try to snap out of it, but in just 1 month things went out of control: my father keeps asking if he could go play ""just a small amount of money"", and when everyone in the family denies him, he just burst into a tantrum and keeps finding excuses to blame us, like ""You play games everyday"", and something like that.

What really fucked us over was the therapist tho: he made my father do a psychological test to see how ""sever"" the gambling addiction was, and he got a score of 5(which apparently is a ""not a big of a deal"" situation), and he believed he was using his gambling addiction to hide from ""us"", the family, that we've always hated him or some kind of shit.

This really sealed our fate, because now my father found the perfect excuse to say ""Seee?? This isn't my faaaault, this is your fault for pushing me into this!"", and he keeps fighting(verbally fortunately) everyday with my mom, and she is just depressed and tired of all of this, and I'm really worried about this.

I'm at my limit too, because it's just sad to come back home, a feel tension all over the air...

What is the best solution right now? We tried changing therapist, but my father now doesn't want to go anywhere else except that therapist that ruined everything.

If you've read this far, thank you for reading my little story/rant/desperate attempt for help.

I really have little time since I'm at work most of my days, and I hoped somebody here could give me some advice, or just some words of comfort.

Thank you all,

Valerio, an italian guy

&#x200B;

PS: before anyone can say anything, we found out that my father had this gambling addiction before he even met my mom, so we're 100% sure he is just finding excuses.",1

I do love him but this is killing me, he becomes a monster a senseless creature when I tell him I want to chill with him and spend an ordinary evening or weekend.

He spends all his money on this and I have to hold the house and its charges with my salary, it’s been 4 months I haven’t been out with my friends because I never have money to, I haven’t done my hair or nails or bought new clothes because I don’t have money to.

My anxiety is telling me not to post cause I’ll be judged but I I’m doing it.,"So I was standing in line at the pharmacy yesterday picking up an albuterol inhaler and some prescribed extra vitamins for my girlfriend (who is almost 9 months pregnant, due in 7 weeks! That she needs to keep her levels good) and as a recovering Heroin addict, it’s been a little under 14 months clean for me, and at this point in my life it’s changed so drastically half the time I don’t even notice the things I used too (people obviously buying drugs, needles on the ground and getting triggered, whatever it may be. 14 months ago I was in a jail cell throwing up myself from Heroin WD while having benzo WD seizures, and here my life is today it’s like that wasn’t even my life. Do any of you ever get that feeling? Like damn, I actually used to do all that stuff for a shot of dope. But no need to re-explain my story, it’s been told. 

So I’m standing in line and a guy walks up next to me and asks if he can buy two 10 packs of 29 gauge needles. Obviously very drug addicted, with his girl standing 30 feet away all sweaty and just you know, that “that person is addicted to dope” look. Anyways, the pharmacy tech said all we have is 29 gauge and he goes “that’s fine thats fine I just need two 2 packs now” (In my state, pharmacies are required to sell up to 5 10 packs of needles and give free narcan if asked) and I just kind watched and listened do his transaction, pacing back and forth and it hit me. “Ah ha! 

That feeling where you think you yourself, my god am I grateful for the life I’m able to live today and not be that guy anymore. Because 14 months ago, I was that junkied out guy buying needles at the pharmacy, but it gave me one of the most gratifying feelings I’ve ever felt. Blessed, grateful,  happy, whichever word you wanna use I felt it. Knowing I was going to go back to my car, pickup dinner for my pregnant girlfriend and I and bring it back to OUR home. Knowing I wasn’t going to wake up sick tomorrow. It just in that moment for some reason made me feel so grateful I’m no longer in that grip of addiction like that that I almost teared up. 

I have super bad anxiety and I’m super nervous to even post this because I’m afraid, I’m but doing it.

I also in no way am saying “ha sucks for that guy” if I could, I wish I could walk up to him and say, “hey man, I can help you into detox. You don’t have to live like this” but we all know we don’t get clean unless we are personally truly ready. 

So I guess I just wanted to make a gratitude post and let anyone and everyone know that is still struggling in active addiction, just getting clean going through WD right now, it gets better. I promise. I’m living proof. With the IV habit I had I should be dead 5 times over but I’m here to make this post. Getting clean was the hardest choice I ever had to make and I had to hit a bad rock bottom to get clean for myself, and it’s not easy, if you can medically detox yourself, please please do. If you can’t. Even if it’s just to get through the worst of the WD’d have a Suboxone or 3 on hand and maybe some clonidine, or a low low dose of a benzo for the sleeplessness and RLS will help tremendously. We are all here for you. The hardest part subsides physically within a week maybe 2, the mental part will always be an uphill battle. 

But always a battle worth fighting. This sort of turned into a rant just from seeing a guy buy needles that made me feel grateful I never have to do that again. But if this reaches even 1 person, I’m happy. It’s hard. I don’t sugar coat things, it’s not easy. But the rewards you reap by getting clean and changing and building a new life are Unimaginable, we can and do recover.

I am a late twenties male that has been struggling with alcohol and substance abuse. I come to you asking you all to hear my story and give me some feedback. I hope it's not a waste of your time, your responses certainly will not be a waste of mine.

I'm not really sure where to start, I guess I'll start with the fact that my family has a history of alcoholism. I have always been torn about the idea of alcoholism and addiction being a disorder/disease rather than a choice. I have always tried to see both sides, but have always leaned towards the idea that continued consumption of alcohol or other drugs over time will result in dependency. However, I've heard the other side which dictates that basically if you have it in you then it will surface. While I sit here and write this, the fact that it is a disease makes more sense in a way. I say this because I know people who started drinking at the same age as me that have not developed a dependency. How can I deny research that is said to have proven that it is a disease? 

Now, that being said, I think I have done an ok job of not letting it take over my life entirely. However, I do think that things are now getting worse for me. A few years ago I lost a job due to an altercation with a co-worker. My drinking had increased a lot while I was working there. Not while I was working, but after I finished the shift I would drink a lot. It was a little bit of the culture because other staff members would hang out and drink together after the bar was closed. One night, said co-worker and I were bartending and after our shift we were drinking together and had a disagreement that resulted in a fight. I was fired the next day, but I was able to bounce back. 

The other job I had at the time picked me up full time and I was able to reduce my alcohol consumption for a good while, trying to learn from my mistake. Things were going very well for a little over a year, and then I broke my ankle. It put me out of work for almost two months. My drinking became worse during this time not working. I was extremely stressed out and lonely, going out to the bars to see people I knew made me feel better. I began to put on a lot of weight from drinking a lot, eating shitty food, and just not taking care of myself at all. Eventually my ankle healed and I started bartending again, but the drinking pace didn't slow down, and I got into trouble for being almost an hour late one day because I was out partying all the night before. I was warned that if there was another issue due to my drinking that I would be fired. That conversation again kicked me into gear, and I got on top of myself. I started eating better, working out more, being more active in general, and most importantly drinking less. That was early spring last year. I had been doing very well for myself mentally, getting my life in order, all while still drinking. As I said, not as much, but still drinking. 

Regardless of how well I was doing, I had a night of weakness the other week and I had some whiskey while I was bartending. I made a very bad decision, and I don't know why I did it. Especially considering that I very rarely ever drank while working. Not only was it against the rules, but it made me feel like I had some sort of control over it. After closing the bar I had some more as well, not that it was against the rules to have a shift drink, but I had two drinks in less than 10 minutes. Management saw me on camera, although the late night drinks were just concern, the drinks during the shift were directly breaking the rules, and another red flag to a drinking problem. They had to fire me. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel like I'm certain times of my life I can control it, but it seems to come back and I fuck myself over. I don't know if I should stop drinking all together, seek alcoholism therapy, or what. Sometimes I feel like I'm lost. I just don't want this to completely take over my life.",3

This is not the man I signed up to be. This is not the man I want to be. I know it’s late and I know it’s right before Christmas. But somebody please..talk to me. 

Maybe I’m just overly emotional because I’m drunk. Maybe I’m lying to myself to deny the gravity of my decisions. But which is the truth? Do I trust my heart and accept that I’m a drunk and need help or do I trust my mind and accept that I’m just an emotional drunk?",23

anyways, while i was dealing w the pain i was EXTREMELY stressed. So as the pain got worse and worse i started to pull out little pieces of my hair i’m not sure why, i guess that just soothed me ? I don’t really remember lol. But TILL THIS DAY, i pull out my hair & THIS TIME i put it in my mouth and in between my teeth 🤦🏻‍♀️ i honestly hate it so much, sometimes i do it out in public but not as noticeable. but i’m so embarrassed by it, i do it probably 20x a day maybe more.

it doesn’t hurt me at all i’m just embarrassed by it. Since i’ve been doing it since august i can see bald spots on the top of my head and it’s so embarrassing",11

I've never had a physical dependence on any substances and I've never tried any drugs other than alcohol. But I have this intense desire to try drugs/get very drunk.

I've had this cravings for a few years already, but it gets particularly intense during school holidays where theres just nothing to do and I'm at home the whole day alone with my thoughts (cos I dont have friends to hang out with). My winter break started in the first week of December and for the past few weeks, almost everyday I've been thinking about drugs/alcohol/clubbing. I spend the whole day reading about these topics, watching videos related to such things, and trying to find sources to obtain drugs. And I would sometimes dream about doing drugs. 

I'm trying to understand why I have such cravings even though ive never tried drugs. And I think it is something like a desire to escape reality, or to fill the loneliness which I feel. Or maybe it is a desire to feel a connection with people because I dont have friends. And it is troubling me because I cant be motivated to do anything productive because I keep getting distracted by my desire to do drugs/drink.",3

I'm however dependent on xanax, but I take half the dose that helps me and skip days sometimes- that one's not recreational at all and only barely helps anyway, but I figured it was worth mentioning as I'm still taking it.

Honestly I already feel bad physically most of the time, and I hadn't used tram since about a month ago, so physically withdrawal has been unremarkable.

My family, however, are heavy drinkers. Not alcoholics, but they love drinking on special occasions and have a pretty damn high tolerance, so there's always a lot of booze around. A little over 20 full bottles are in the house right now, not hyperbole.

It's fully visible, all the time. I know where it is. I know if i sneaked a bit of each bottle nobody would notice. And I get offered drinks, all. The. Time. Refusing keeps getting harder and harder and I finally gave in today, but it feels worse than anything else. I want a cigarette, or anything at all. Anything. My skin feels like it itches.

This isn't my first attempt to quit, and I guess it won't be the last, but I'm tired. Really tired. It doesn't even feel worth it to quit, since my future is bleak anyway.

I'm not drinking daily, but definitely more than a normal amount. Nobody notices. Nobody cares. It's all light-hearted jokes, if it's mentioned at all. Alcohol is the hardest of all to resist, as I don't even need to leave the house to get it.

Morning! I can beat this, life is great, last week was a blip. I always recover. It’s all fine, I take photos of the radiators and cooker as I leave. My own way of controlling OCD. My shrink tell’s me that I’m an innovator. I feel strangely smug about this.

Look at those big houses, I’ll have one of those soon. Keep going, a few more years. Damn, the guy coming out of that one looks like he’s only a few years older than me. Maybe he has an ugly wife? No she’s great looking. Sometimes you can’t catch a break.

I should get a girlfriend. The redhead that just got on the tube is pretty. I consider talking to her. No,  I’ll update my Tinder. What’s the point though? All the women I meet seem to be after money. Ah, why not? One last try, I change my profile to ‘works in investment banking’. That’ll do the trick.

I like the girl who makes my coffee, she’s sweet. I think she likes me. But she works at the coffee shop. Is she the right type? Look at that guy. He’s wearing sharper shoes than I am and a more expensive coat. I look at mine. Bobbles.

I get back to the day. A meeting I’d set up was cancelled. My MD admonished me. My mind is whirring with anxiety, this is terrible. Suddenly everything important is lost. The coat, the shoes..

I can’t go home, what will I do? I text 10 friends, well friends. Drinking buddies I guess. My old friends are dull, they don’t know what’s needed for success. My drinking buddy leaves. I make a call. Ah, Lisa’s flat. She understands me. One line, then two, and three, four, five, six Cathartic. 'Time’s up honey’. I bargain a little, but the price is the price and I'm all out.

It’s morning. I am sweating, trembling. I check my tinder, I have a hit. Her name is Anastasiya. She looks pretty. But she's probably just after money.",1

The facts:

* About 6 years ago, we discovered she was on a grossly amount of overprescribed narcotics. In addition to anti-depressants and sleeping pills, her doctor had her on Ativan, Oxy and I can't even remember what else. She had a habit of faking sickness to get admitted to the hospital when she ran out of her supply. This had gone on for about 10 years until it was revealed to us what was happening. I don't even know how she is still alive. Her doctor should have been strung up by his neck tie. 
* Her boyfriend at the time almost left her but chose to stay and ""support her through this"". The ignorant fucker forced her to get clean at home. Didn't believe in rehab. He confronted the doctor but didn't even go after the doctor's license. 
* She got clean and was really good for a long time and then she and the boyfriend broke up. She was *really* good after that. She got her life together, was independent, got a new car, etc. She was a new woman. We were so proud of her.
* Since then, she has devolved into something completely different. She hangs out with this friend (less so the past few months but still here and there) and this friend we all know uses to everything under the sun (morphine, heroin, meth, etc.). And it seemed for a long time that my sister was her keeper; drove her to get groceries, appointments, helped her with her kids, etc. but it has seemed more and more that there was a co-dependancy there. My sister needed her just as much as she needed my sister.
* One of the last times I saw my sister, **she was really keyed up**. She was hyper and her voice was really deep and horse. My husband noticed this too. I can't quite describe it. I've read that a changed voice like this can result from heroin use. 
* We, my husband, Mom, Aunt and sister were hanging out at my Mom's place and she started going on in great detail the drug use of her friend. Being like, ""Can you believe it?! METH! Blah blah blah, drugs!!"" **This to me seemed to be subterfuge. Highlighting her friends use so that she would remain undetected.**
* She **shuts everyone out of her life unless she wants something** from them. People will call and message her and she will completely ignore them. She and I never speak and she barely visits or talks to our mother. 
* She leaves work sick all the time and goes home to bed for the day. She has a bunch of physical ailments (IBS, endometriosis, etc.) but refuses to do anything about them. **Oh yeah. She also has really poor kidney function.** *Gee. I wonder why!?*
* She smokes weed and claims it is only that but people talk to her on the phone and can barely make her out. **Mumbles a lot.** 
* Now it's the holidays and as usual, she uses the holidays to amplify her chaos. It's like clockwork. She shuts everyone out until she needs their time and attention and uses it completely up. 

Although my frustration with my sister is apparent, I'm not being judgemental here. Our family has seen many addictions, including my parents who were both alcoholics (mother has been sober for almost 30 years 🏅). 

I'm just looking for advice on how to deal with this. I've been ready for a long time to wash my hands of her but what if it's still worth trying? I would hate for something to have happened that I could have helped prevent.

As I say, many of the signs are there but she would kill you as to look at you if you ever even suggested she was using anything. Another tactic. She is very convincing. 

With such conviction in her so-called sobriety and no proof whatsoever, how do you tackle this problem? Is it even possible?

Is it possible to have an intervention when there is no proof? The fact that her life is simply in turmoil all the time, would this be enough to hold an intervention and hope that it reveals what we suspect? 

Sorry for the long post. I look forward to any advice you can lend. 

Peace and thanks.",5

You came into our lives about 10 years ago although I never knew it then. It took probably 2 years before we realized you had a hold onto this beautiful child of mine: My first born, my world, the breathtakingly beautiful girl who made me move mountains and who drove my resolve because there was nothing equally as important in my life than her and her sister.

I despise you, I hate that because of you, Savannah checked into rehab 4 times (never completing) and overdosed 3 times almost dying every single time . One of these times was when she was driving the car she stole from me to go get high. She hit 2 parked vehicles while she slumped behind the wheel unconscious, only to be revived by the paramedics and Narcan.

I despise the fact that your uphold is so strong that even when she is hospitalized, because of her needle use for an infectious cyst next to her spine not other than Mersa, she still chooses to put you first and checks herself out twice AMO to get high while I stand there helplessly watching her compromise her health, her life.

I hate that she puts you first, not because you make her feel good anymore, but because without you, she feels deathly sick every time she attempts to beat you.

I hate that the best way to indirectly have a remote shot of beating you is for me to cut any ties with one of the 2 human beings I love the most in the world, because the tragedy you bring into her life makes me a powerless enabler at best.

I despise you for making the purest love on earth, a parent love, a detrimental weapon to her potential recovery.

I despise you for making me stop to breathe every time a strange phone number with the same area code as where she chooses to reside shows up on my phone, making me think it is another hospital with perhaps the worst news of all.

I hate that you render me powerless and incapable of saving the one person I love the most in the world. And that, counter nature to every fiber of my motherly being, I have to divorce myself from her life of turpitudes and disasters because that is what the addiction experts and counselors advised us to do.

This is the saddest club in the world we belong to, all of us parents and loved ones of addicts. Our love never falters and we must carry this silent burden with courage. If you are like me feeling the weight of the unavoidable absence of your addict loved one during the Holidays, I want to send tons of good vibes your way. Hoping for a clean future one day at a time.

I have always been a sexual person. I remember being as young as four & rewinding the TV several times to rewatch a scene that gave me the butterfly feeling I couldn’t yet describe.

Started masturbating around 6 or 7. Didn’t understand that it was sexual or taboo, just that it was appealing. Nothing too out of the ordinary. I would look up videos of water births on the internet & for some reason, watch that as I did it.

I did this frequently. From age 8-present I do it, average, five times a day. Doesn’t matter if I’m even sexually aroused or just bored or can’t sleep: it gets done. I use porn sometimes & other times don’t. I doubt porn is a part of this as I never actually watched porn until I was fifteen.

I’ve never gotten wet in a sexual situation. I’ve made out with people and it’s pleasurable but I don’t get the same rush. Never been past 2nd base but wouldn’t matter because I literally cannot get wet.

Tried to quit & only lasted 69 (hehe) days. Impressive but very close calls. This was almost a year ago.

I want to quit for real in 2020. I’m coming up to the age where I’m gonna have lots of opportunities to experiment & have sex, I don’t want to be desensitized & miss out.",5

I’m a recovering heroin addict and moved away from home about a year ago to attend treatment. I ended up staying in the new city and getting a job, apartment, etc to start over. Everything was going well until a couple months ago I was laid off from my job. I’ve been busting my ass trying to find a new job but I can’t find anything. I’ve literally applied to over 100 jobs. I have no money and am the most depressed and stressed I’ve ever been. I work side jobs but I’m not making ends meet. My family has been really hesitant to help me financially because of my track record, but I’ve done everything to be as transparent with them about where the money is going. I’ve let them talk to my roommate, the doctor, the pharmacist, provided receipts for everything. Somehow they think that I should be self sufficient with a year sober and don’t have any grasp of what it takes to live. 70% of people my age receive financial support of some kind from their parents but they seem to think I’m exempt from that. All of my siblings have received more assistance from them than I have but the second I lose my job they start accusing me of using and are suspicious. I understand why but it’s defeating when I’m already on the verge of just saying screw it.

Fast forward to thanksgiving, I went home and had a great trip. Everyone was really glad to see I was doing well. But the problem is that my people pleasing behavior hasn’t gone away. I don’t want to disappoint or make them worry so lately I catch myself lying because I don’t want to worry them. So when I was home I asked to use my dads car to go to the movies with a family member. I was running really late so when I knew I wouldn’t make the movie, I decided to go stop by to see a friend. I still told my dad I went to the movies because honestly I’m embarrassed that I can’t get my act together and be somewhere on time. I also knew that if I went to see a friend, no matter who the friend was, that I would be looked at with suspicion. Well news got back to my dad that I didn’t go to the movie and everything blew up in my face with my family basically swooping in to intervene on me. I panicked and told them I locked the keys in the car and had to wait for a locksmith. They wanted proof so I made a fake receipt to just make things ok and I wanted to just move on.

Here we are 2 days until I’m supposed to come home for Christmas, my flight booked and all and my dad freaks out that he doesn’t want me to come home because he says he just knows I’m an addict and a liar. So they look into the receipt I made and figure out it’s fake. I own up to it and want to come clean because it’s been eating me up. So my mom then decides to cancel my flight. So now I’m going to be spending Christmas completely alone. I have hardly any friends here and no money to do anything anyways. Christmas was the one thing I was looking forward to in all the darkness and gloom and now that’s gone. I know that I did it to myself but I’m absolutely beside myself. It makes me regret even telling the truth because if I’d just cling to that lie, I would still be coming home. I feel like no matter what I do I will never be trusted again. I can’t help but lie to try and please people. I really want to be honest, but they don’t understand that because of how volatile and trauma I’ve been through because of them, that it’s easier to appease them. Anyways, I don’t know what to do. I’m on the verge of just using since they think I am anyways. I’ve never been this depressed and hopeless. Christmas is my favorite time of year and I just wanted to spend it with my family. I know other people have it worse than me but i really hate myself right now.

Do any of you guys still have problems with lying and people pleasing even in sobriety? I feel like I’m a horrible person and maybe there’s something else wrong with me to do that. How would you all handle a situation like this? I’m so sorry for the long post but I have no one to talk to right now. Thanks so much for any help or advice you guys might have. Happy holidays!",2

I wanted to share my story.,"I have to say it’s been a journey. I hope anyone reading this can get something out of my story. I haven’t made a post yet in the group but I’m an active reader. 

First thing, I’m somewhat conflicted on how far my “addiction” runs. Deeper than anticipated when getting into the program but I felt I wasn’t in as deep a hole as others. I feel terrible saying this... because I know comparing is not a thing. I also feel it needs to be said though because it’s one of the few things I struggle with in recovery. I’ve always had a strong will when I wanted something and I have a pretty good head on my shoulders. Who knows though, maybe I’m just riding the pink cloud right now. 

This may be TL;DR but I wanted to share and maybe get some input where I need it....

My story: 

I’ve always loved to party. It wasn’t ever really something I thought about. My parents partied, my friends, pretty much everyone in my immediate sphere. The thing was (especially with my parents), it never effected anyone’s life really. They would drink on weekends and occasionally dabble in other things but they never missed a day of work in their lives. Never misused any substance and never neglected responsibility. I was very much like this myself. I mean, there were times where I may have shrugged things off but it was never anything major. I could of *”done life”* a little more responsible, but yeh, yolo. 

I started drinking around 15 and did a decent amount of it. I think this is standard for a lot of teens. At least people I knew. The older I got and the different people I’d meet partying and being in the music scene had my curiosities grow. I tried psychedelics, ecstasy and coke. E became a big thing in my area in my late teens and a lot of my friends got pretty into it. I never got into anything enough though where it really effected me in school or my job. I never liked being so fucked up where I lost control, where I was sick or super hungover the next day. I stood by and watched some of my friends party *too hard*. I was there in the ways I could be but still keeping my own stability. I never understood how someone could lose control like that? How one could just want that for themselves. More drugs. More alcohol. I used to shake my head in shame. I didn’t get it... and even looked down on these people at times. Why can’t someone just have the will to stop? 

So fast forward. Mid twenties to thirty-ish. I practiced using and drinking for years “responsibly.” Or so I thought. I had this mindset that others were always more fucked than me. That I graduated college with a great GPA and I was doing okay. I had a decent job, responsibilities I took care of, a car, a daughter. I never let my partying effect me. My life was essentially very controlled. I had my days where I may have drank more, felt more hungover or did a few extra lines when I shouldn’t have but I always came through. Drinking was a few times a month maybe thing and drugs were maybe a once or twice a year thing. Maybe a no thing. Just depending on the situation. But I didn’t care or put much thought into it. 

When I hit 30 I started getting really frustrated with things in my life. I was in an unsettling relationship and I wasn’t happy with where I was with my career. I felt like I was missing so many things but I could never pinpoint what. I felt very “regular” or boring maybe. I ended up leaving my bf of 6 years and started branching out trying to find that part of me I felt was missing. That’s when I discovered the rave scene. Music had always been a big part of my life. I put concerts, shows and the scene in general above a lot of other things most of my life. Never above responsibility though. This was mostly because I had always been somewhat of an outcast and I felt very at peace with other people who were part of any punk, indie or electronic music scene and I just got a natural high being there. 

I met my current bf in the depths of my discovery of music festivals and electronic music. He showed me the ropes and I sailed away with it. It was here where I really started to drown in my addiction. It was hard to admit it because I was *”never that person”*, remember? I was always in control. Always responsible. But I was sick of that version of myself. It never gave me what I wanted out of life. I never felt whole. And I finally realized I found what I was missing. Life wasn’t boring or linear anymore. It was an adventure and it was chaos. And I sorta loved it? 

It got to a point where I put the chaos above everything else. I used all my vacation time to go to music festivals. I stopped spending as much time with my daughter. I went to as many concerts and raves as I could. I spent countless amounts of money on drugs and alcohol. Why? Because I felt free. It wasn’t until this past summer when a person I very much viewed as a major addict told my bf that he should keep an eye on me because I would overdose on cocaine. I was really taken by this. Because how could someone like her say that about me? The person in control? No. 

It wasn’t until I was countless lines deep, shaking, heart pounding and throwing up and wanting to go to the hospital until it hit me. Until I realized I did wayyyyy more than the others I was with. Until I saw that I couldn’t have a good night with just some beers and some friends. I had to have coke. Once a year became once a month. Then once a weekend. Then I couldn’t go out without it. I was using my credit cards to pull out money to buy it. Money I didn’t have. If I couldn’t find it, it set me in a bad mood for the rest of the evening. I couldn’t be happy around people I loved because I wasn’t high. The high didn’t even do anything anymore. Didn’t last long. And I was blowing through it so fast that it wasn’t even worth it. But I still kept going. 

I called my friend from the back porch after a long night of drugs and alcohol. That same friend who struggled with addiction years before me. The one I judged and shook my head at. I cried to her and told her I finally understood. That I was sorry and that I wanted her to help me. Because if she didn’t, I knew what I was losing. I’d lose my job, my house, my kid. I still had all those things but I felt them teetering knowing the path I was on. The person I used to be was gone. The person who never called into work called in high and made lies to do more drugs. The person who had control of their finances was running into debt. And the worst part, the mother I used to be cared more about partying than her own child. I was a mess. All because I never got enough out of life. Because I did something selfish and I couldn’t turn back. I realized I got what I needed and then some.... it was time to find that balance again. 

She brought me to C.A. And I felt a warmth there I hadn’t ever felt from all the music scenes, the drugs or even the beautiful people I’ve come across in my journeys. Now I was **really** getting what I was missing out of life still. But it was healthy. That friend I used to judge is now my sponsor. She’s helped me through two relapses and picked me up when I needed her. I realized balance wasn’t in the cards for me anymore. Ive opened up doors I now can’t close. There’s no drinking without cocaine for me now. No festivals without drug use or hard drinking. It is what it is. I don’t have control. I lost it. But what I do have is my spirituality. I found myself between four walls and a group of fucked up people. I’ve cried so many times and worked so hard to get to where I’m at. I’m not even through the program but every step I achieve feels like weights lifted off of me. And it’s not from my addiction. It’s from the mental struggles I never knew I had. The parts the program guided me to.

I finally found that real version of myself that I was looking for. I found inner peace. I found myself in the depths of my own insanity. And now I want to help others find themselves to. I realized it’s the hardest thing to understand that YOU have been there all along. That you are your own worst enemy. It just takes a clear head to realize what potential you have, what life has for you. I wake up everyday and I feel okay now. I feel better. Like I can do anything. I’m healthy. I’m doing more than I ever have. People tell me how happy and full I look. I am okay with being me for the first time ever and I look forward to every day sharing me with others. I’ve never had that feeling, and I owe it all to recovery. Thank you so much. 

I hope someone will get something out of this. And that if you were like me it’s that much harder to come out of the fog when you have this picture painted of yourself. The picture that you’re not “that bad.” Accept your flaws and own them. I was to arrogant and stuck up to accept my own. I was so blind that I couldn’t even see the person I was or who I was hurting. Or what I was supposed to be. Let yourself lose. Then start over. This has been the most freeing, spiritual thing I have ever done. And I only hope someone else can feel the gratitude that I do today.

Edit: I never hit “rock bottom” in my own opinion and I feel that this may lead me into a relapse. I am having a hard time finding a balance between the music scene and my addiction. I never want to give up shows or festivals but I know how hard that can be in my recovery journey. I also feel I want to drink on a lot of days but never do. I want to go back to drinking without drugs. Find that balance again but I am too scared to even go around anything right now. I know this may never be possible and it scares me. Any advice from anyone that had similar struggles is welcome 🙏🏼 

TL;DR I was once a very functional addict but some wrong turns and stressful times turned me into a full blown coke head. I stopped before it was too late and I discovered a beautiful thing in recovery. Now I want to share.",42
2019-12-21 09:03:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/edq8tq/my_boyfriends_addiction_is_ruining_the/,My boyfriends addiction is ruining the relationship,"I really need help on this one, because I am about ready to throw in the towel. I am completely alone in dealing with him, as he keeps up appearances all around us, and anytime I try to tell someone, things just go south and he will blame me for anything and anything he can think of.

I know the story to come might sound ridiculous at first, but PLEASE hear me out. He is addicted to weed. I know people keep telling me (him included) that you can’t get addicted to weed, but he is apparently the exception to this rule. He uses everyday, multiple joints a day. Some of the things that take a toll on our relationship:

1. He’s a completely different person when high or when he’s been using for a period of time. He’ll stop caring and becomes the type of person who would leave me on the floor bleeding, only to step over me to get to where he needs to be. He’ll usher me out of the house so he can “sneak” some joints or go buy his stash. He’ll only think of himself and will disregard almost all my needs. Some of this includes sleeping for 12 hours, only getting up to watch Tv and ignore me.

2. He’ll get behind the wheel while high. We already had a car accident because he was so high “he couldn’t find the brake”. Thank fucking god that nobody noticed. Any objection is met with anger or laughter, because I’m “so dumb to think that you can’t drive while high”. Dude, you caused at least 3 accidents in your life that I know of!

3. He’ll gaslight me. He’ll sit there, smelling of weed and cigarettes, and when I confront him, he’ll laugh and call me delusional. Untrusting. Hateful. Cold. Sometimes he’ll even go as far as to say that instead of just imagining bullshit, I’m purposefully making it up to start fights.

4. His dad died earlier this year because of cancer. He smoked a pack a day to say the least, and the cancer originated in his lungs. Nobody was surprised, but it sure was horrible. Supported him through it all, even enabled him. But after that, he’d sometimes get sick from it. Like, physically ill from smoking so much. He went as far as to swear on his father’s soul that he was done with that stuff. A few days later I found him high and he laughed and said “people say shit like that all the time, I can’t believe you took that serious”.

All in all, I can’t take it anymore. He has stopped thrice in the 3 years we’ve been together, and became a complete anti-drug and smoking person. He’d end up smoking behind my back and boasting about not smoking to everyone around him. I can’t trust him, I stopped believing in him and have done everything I can to help him, but I don’t know what to do anymore. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but I could go on for an hour about it, so let’s just keep it at that. Besides finally leaving, what else can I do?",1

I haven't been able to rest tonight because all I can think about is using. I've convinced myself that I want to throw everything away and binge for the next couple of weeks. The reoccurring theme in my thoughts is that the life I've set up for myself is ""too much pressure"" to uphold, so I may as well stop my meandering and get to using again.

I had been sober from methamphetamine since August of 2014. I have an excellent career and I am getting married to an incredible woman in August. Up until a couple months ago, my past use was just a passing memory that had little emotional bearing and zero draw. Starting in October, whenever I would have a free moment of thought, driving from work or going to sleep, my mind would shift to visceral imagery of a needle going into my vein, the blood being drawn. Sometimes, if I was alone, i would yell for my mind to stop, my heart rate would quicken and my chest would tighten. The march of latent drug addiction was impossible to stop. I shared my urges with my fiance, my best friend and even the addiction subreddit. I was doing everything I could think of to stop this scenario from playing out. I did not want this to happen. With the dark web, getting drugs is exceptionally easy, so in a moment of weakness I ordered a ball of meth. About a minute after I pushed the plunger down, I texted my fiance to tell her what I did. She is so sympathetic, supportive, but also, incredibly scared for me. I'm so thankful I can be completely honest with her. Right now, I'm in the crashing stage, my arms are sore from pumping poison into them and I'm developing a plan so this never happens again. I threw away the rest of the drugs, which was most of it.

I'm setting up an appointment with a therapist, going to my first ever NA meeting and hopefully getting my shit back together. I can't let this precipitate a return to drug use. I am very disappointed, and I know that I instead of a pressure release, I may have just fed my demons. 

Thanks for listening.",76

So lets start off from the start. Early on i had suicidal depression and being intoxicated (not necessarily being drunk or high, just  a buzz - anything other then normal sobriety) made life more bearable and as a result better. 

After years of being high out of my mind daily on crazy cocktails of drugs; in doses that people couldn't function on, I'd go about my day as normal. To the point i was 24/7 high off weed and if i was i wouldn't consider it being high it was just 'normal' because it's how i always felt. (Note: the weed was sufficient help for mental health) id be on lsd mdma coke whatever and just go about my day like everyone else and honestly it has been some of the best years of my life. 

Because i was at the edge of suicide and jumped i was caught by drugs. It's a blessing and a curse - i have a weird relationship with drugs. I kind of owe them my life? 

But long story short i live my life constantly high at inhuman levels and it is benefiting me in the sense it keeps me going. But when I'm sober i just have no will to go on. I don't even know if it's addiction, more co-dependant but i don't know where else to post. But is it neccisarly a bad thing? I don't let drugs run my life and i am making progress in life.

Any advice much appreciated :)",2

I am female 17 years old will be 18 in February. I've got 2 cases dropped and my 3rd case my dad took my charges for me. So God helped me with keeping my record clean. I went to rehab a few months ago and was good for a little while after I got out. I started a DBT group and I'm going to individual therapy along with family therapy.

Everytime I confronted him about it he either lied to me or ignored it, so I distanced myself from him and told him that I will not be a part of this, but I am not sure if this is the right approach.

I have a friend that I know from childhood days. Due to several reason, like complicated family situations, but maybe also due to his nature, he is a loyal person, but also often quite difficult, with what I would call a distorted image of himself and the people around him. He is often lazy and defintly had issues with Weed for years, often doesn't wanna join in any activity for weeks or month (so that and some point we stop asking) and then blames us for never inivting him... and tons of shit like this.

Aside from on and off weed problems, he has been using other drugs (mainly coke, but also speed and MDMA and LSD occasionally). There were severval developments during the past 5-10 years of him using something casually in party settings, from it often getting out of hand  in a few month with him going partying waaay to much every week, to him crashing, going back to chilling at home gaming and smoking weed, with a few moments of him getting his live back on track for a short while. The problem is, that most of our friends only rarely see him during these times, since he worked in the club scene and knows a lot of people who he turns to during these unhealthy times.

The biggest crash so far happend about half a year ago when he came down with a pretty big depression and panic attacks. It was so serious that he actually reached out to us and his dad and admitted himself to therapy (tho he was kinda 'happy' that he wasn't admitted for drugs, but for depression, which I think wasn't in his best interest...). He was put on anti-depressant, which made him feel better pretty quickly, which (what I believe) led to him thinking he just got better, stopped taking the meds and started partying again. (from what I believe this fits a bipolar disorder pretty well...)

It might be important to note that I do believe that a lot his mental health issues don't result from drugs directly, but that he rather was always so interested in taking drugs BECAUSE of his mental health issues, which now have amplified through the drugs.

It might also be relevant that I have some experience myself. While I am far away from his way of using, I am still somewhat 'tainted' when it comes to the whole issue. My buddy tried to get me to party with him many times in the past and while I am not completly opposed to it, I haven't done so in a long time, since I don't want to 'normalize' his use by taking part in it.

This all brings us to my current situation:

When I first noticed he was using again after his big crash, I wrote him a pretty long text, telling him that I will be there for him as a friend, as I have been during the past few month of his depression/panic attacks, but I believe it is a big mistake to take drugs again, especially while on anti-depressants and I don't want anything to do with it. He confronted me a while later and told me it has only been a few select times and that he wasn't doing it anymore, only to hear from another friend, a few ours later, that he went over there to do some coke... Since then I've been pretty distant, only small taking when I saw him and only reaching out to him, when his dad reached out to me, asking if he (my buddy) was ok, since his dad (who my buddy asked for help during his breakdown) hadn't gotten any answer from him in almost two month. Whenever I confront my buddy with this stuff he justs ghosts me. I know that he has lost his job and started working his old bar job again and I know that he is about to loose his apartment and he kinda moved in with his girlfriend (who I don't know well, but I'm pretty sure she is living a similar lifestyle than him).

**My question to you all is: Am I handling the situation correctly by keeping my distance? Or do I need to step up in some way?**

Eveytime I stepped up and told him that I believe he has a problem and he needs to stop, he went defensive and ghosted me for a while or simply lied to me... Not sure how to get through to him, but I do believe he still cares for my oppion and maybe even my approval.",2

2019-12-19 16:43:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/eczyjh/sounds_like_a_shitpost_but_im_addicted_to_sitting/,Sounds like a shitpost but I'm addicted to sitting on the toilet [TMI],"I know this sounds ridiculous but hear me out. I have a feeling I'm not the only one. I sit on the toilet for a minimum of 2 hours a day, and it has gone up to 4+ hours. It's really ridiculous how much time I waste sitting on the toilet. 

My daily routine is to go to the toilet at night around 10-11pm, sit on the toilet till 1-2am then take a shower right after. It stems from the need to feel clean both inside and outside, like trying to empty myself of all the shit I possibly can is cleaning inside while showering is cleaning outside. So I basically sit on the toilet for as long as possible trying to shit more. I'm not constipated, in fact I shit everyday. I just have this desire to cleanse myself inside and feel lighter or less clogged up if you get my drift. 

I use my phone while on the toilet which I thought was the cause of my long hours of sitting, so I tried not to use my phone. I ended up not being able to shit at all. It's stupid but I can't shit if I concentrate on shitting so I need something to take my attention away. When I was young, it used to be books and now, it's my phone. I've had this habit since I was about 9, but I don't think it was that bad, maybe 30mins max? But the older I got, the longer I started to sit and time just passes really fast while I'm sitting. I think I also get comfortable after an hour or so in, so I just continue sitting till I realise how ridiculous of a situation I'm in that I finally get up.

I'm also so used to shitting in the comfort of my own home at night when everyone is asleep and no one bothers me that when I'm at a camp or a school trip, I can't shit. I feel stressed and pressured to go faster because people will begin to question me and rush me if I sit too long. I have gone 7 days at a camp without shitting because of how uncomfortable I was. 

My family members are used to this happening so they just think it's a bad habit and not an addiction, and tbh I'm scared to admit that it's an addiction. I mean it's just such a huge waste of time and so disgusting and ridiculous that I don't really want to tell anyone about it. The most I have done is given vague mentions to my friends about my toilet time, but not the hours I spend.

I have no idea how to get rid of this issue, I feel really weird and uncleaned-out if I spend less than an hour in the toilet. This is a real issue, any advice would be helpful.",23

It hasn’t gotten any easier.,"About 44 days ago I [16F] realised I had a bit of a cigarette addiction (I made a post about, you can scroll through my account to find it), and so then in the proceeding days I made the transition into stopping completely. The weird thing is at the time of me making the decision to stop, I didn’t have any cigs, but I decided to buy 3 packs as a way of saying goodbye. I went through those packs in 3 days, which required me smoking more than I ever had, and to be completely honest it felt really good in the moment.

After that I basically  went cold turkey, and I thought at least a month in, things would be easier but they’re not. It feels like it’s  actually getting harder and harder each day. I thought maybe the sensation of smoking weed would be a good (healthier) alternative to smoking cigarettes, and I also knew there’s no way that I’d obtain weed as easily as cigarettes so I wouldn’t smoke it that often but I found that it’s fun, but that’s it. It’s just fun. On reflection I think I was trying to find something else to latch on to besides cigarettes, so I chose weed. Once I realised it didn’t really do it for me in the same way cigs did (idk I think it’s the fact that it’s a lot more recreational, and not something you can have anytime, anywhere) I’ve been desperately scrambling for something else.

Right now cigarettes are kinda consuming me. There’s been so many days where I swear I can smell them, and I’ll just be sitting in my room. It’s so tough, cos everything in me is telling me to give up.

Does this get easier? Will I stop thinking about it? I think I’m just posting here, cos I need motivation more than anything. Thank you everyone ❤️",10

We met on Facebook Dating and he's a really sweet guy. We have been seeing each other exclusively for a few weeks and he's freaking amazing. He's very patient and caring. He has helped me with my self esteem at times and is affectionate towards me. Here is where I'm concerned. 

1. I've never dated an addict before, regardless of what the addiction is. I really don't know what to expect and according to a Google search, chance of relapse is high for heroin. He has told me when he gets cravings and he is very open with me about it. 
2. He's been clean a little over a year. He's been to rehab MANY times (I think he said 22) though and has ODed 4 times. 
3. He has warned me about what signs to look for should he relapse which I get. 
4. He also used to have a lot of wild sex with both men and women (over 150 partners) but he has tested clean for an STI check. I got concerned about this especially because wild sex plus needle usage equals not a good thing. 

He is very sweet and open with whatever I ask. I apologize if I ask him about things sometimes and he tells me not to apologize because he understands. He has a full time job and is working on himself a decent amount with concrete plans for his future and goals. He's honest. I'm just not sure what to do. I'm a little worried about falling in love and 20 years down the road, he relapses and future possible kids have to witness that. I also used to be an ex cutter so I know a little bit about addiction but not a lot. 

Please help.

Opinions Wanted.,"I have recently spent a year without videogames in an attempt to break an addiction and reliance on them. While my addiction does not have the physical and psychological effects that come with some substance addictions, I really do feel like I was addicted to videogames, as I would play them so much that the other facets of my life began to suffer. My grades, social life, and physical health started to decline as I began to skip class, hanging out with friends and exercise to spend all day playing videogames. They were and maybe still are a form of escape for me from the responsibilities of the real world. When I'm playing videogames I can become enveloped in a world that is separate from the problems I face in my waking life.

As stated, I sold all of my consoles and games and have not owned any for over a year. I have played games, but only socially with friends, and a few games on my own but have strictly limited my time playing. This has been successful in improving my life in general. For the first time in my life, I made straight A's this semester. My parents are proud of my school performance for the first time in so long. I have more time to spend with friends and I am eating healthy and regularly going to the gym. With all that being said, I find myself wanting to return to games.

I feel as though having spent time away from them has given me the ability to distinguish what my priorities are in life. I have been successful in limiting my time playing games and balancing my workload with fun, and am thinking about buying a Nintendo Switch to see if I can come back to videogames with a healthy attitude and the determination to not fall down that slippery slope again. The problem is, I don't know anything about addiction, and whether or not people are able to do this. Is it something I will have to assess as I go? Please reply if you have experience with addiction or opinions on returning back to games. As opposed to something like substance addiction, videogames are not physically or mentally harming to me, they have extremely inhibited my ability to live my life in the past, but does the fact that they are not a harmful substance means that there is a place for them in my life with strict moderation?",8

I’m offering to help anyone who may need advice in regards to tapering off certain opioids. I’m not a doctor, however I am a pharmacist specialising in addiction and am currently working in a methadone/ suboxone / subutex dispensing clinic. 

I dose over 50 patients daily and am in daily contact with doctors in regards to the dosage and tapering of patients medications. 

To taper off opioids there are several factors to consider:

1. The current dose and duration of your medicine
2. Your past drug use before the programme 
3. Your past, current and foreseeable future’s social situation
4. Your past and current mental health condition.
5. Your personal desire to taper off your medication
6. Do you want to come off your medication completely or just simply reduce your current dose?
7. How aggressive do you want to be with your taper?
8. Your doctors consent 
9. Your relationship with your doctor

These are all some of the factors to consider when planning a medication taper, all of which are vital for the success of the taper and for the prevention of future relapse. 

Medications form one vital aspect of addiction recovery, however mental and social aspects are equally important to both be successful in the detoxing and for maintaining a healthy lifestyle once drug free.

I’ve never done anything harder than weed or alcohol and still only use it socially. But I’ve been working a part time job for about three years now while in school and around 90% of my coworkers are recovering addicts, primarily from narcotics rather than alcohol. Anyway, recently I found out that a coworker of mine relapsed and is out in the run. She was doing really well. She has 3 children whom she was able to regain rights to see, was promoted to a manager position, and was clean for a while. She spoke often about how she was so happy to have her children back and to be able to spend time with her mom again. I truly believe she wanted to stay clean, yanno. She always talked about going to meetings with her friends in her house and she was one of the brightest and happiest personalities I’ve met. Eventually, she even moved out of her recovery house and into a new house with a friend, who is also a recovering addict. The woman she moved in with is still clean and definitely didn’t influence her into using again.

As someone who has never used and isn’t familiar with the process of recovery, why do you think my friend relapsed when she had a lot of positive things going for her? 

This is the second person who I was close with at my work place that had a bad relapse where they just completely disappeared and it’s really been weighing on me.",1

First time that I'm not hoping for some kind of miracle to happen that will solve my problems, but I'm really positive about making active changes and improving myself and facing my issues.

The last couple years I didn't really know what to do with my life, didn't really do anything and let a small struggle with substances develop into an alcohol addiction. Then when I had an idea what I wanted to do, I couldn't really do it anymore due to my problems, which crushed my already shaky self confidence. 

After finally realizing I needed some real help I looked into some groups, saw a therapist, but it didn't ""click"" with her at all, called some others but none of them had room and I became even more desperate, almost giving it up. But one of them suggested a more specialized organization, sent me references and I went there today (almost bailed last minute, but really glad I went).

They are basically what I had hoped to find for so long and it was like the guy I talked to really wanted to find a right approach for me, we ended up talking for almost an hour and much longer than scheduled. What really touched me somehow was when I was talking about my problems and he was just looking at me sincerely and went.. yeah, that is all fixable. Like, I know in theory it is but having someone say that to you face to face and you feel like they are really meaning it and actually have a plan how.. that was special to me.

THERE IS HOPE!,"It took me 8 years to mention to the public that I struggle with addiction. I should have done it sooner, but I guess I just wasn’t ready. I’m writing this to let people know they are not alone. I released my first album *Lonely Traveler* back in 2004. There is then a long gap between records. Music is my world! I continued writing songs and performing shows to help spread the word in support of *Lonely Traveler*, but soon lost my way. I was in and out of behavioral health units and rehabs for 2 to 3 years. I had my last drink(God willing) on November 16th 2010. I’m lucky to be alive. I was diagnosed with depression and bi-polar disorder while in the behavioral health unit. I’ve had panic attacks and anxiety since I was 12 years old. Panic attacks that were so bad I ended up in the hospital. When they first started I had no idea what was happening to me. I thought I was dying, or having a heart attack. They were very scary. Over the years I’ve learned to deal with them much better. They aren’t as frequent or severe. From the outside looking in you’d never know I had any mental health ailments. I always greet people with a big smile and my dimples do a good job helping cover up my darker days.

That being said, I think all humans are depressed from time to time. Some definitely more than others. I also feel addiction and depression/anxiety are cut from the same cloth. I used alcohol to self medicate for years. It worked for a long time to help with the pain until it didn’t work anymore. The wheels eventually fell off the bus and the train derailed from the tracks. I write this to let those out there that are still suffering know that there is hope. There is also nothing to be ashamed of. Admitting that you are sad or depressed or have an addiction problem is hard. I can promise you though, that once you face your demons and accept them you’ll feel relief. When you do ask for help you’ll immediately feel relief. Once you surrender, you start winning.

There is definitely still a stigma in regards to mental illness in general. Mental illness isn’t treated the same as other ailments. People feel sorry for those with cancer, but not people with addiction problems. I think the general public has come around more in the last few years, but there is still a long way to go. Also, there are some that truly understand that addiction is a disease. The stigma isn’t categorical among all people.

Being a guy, people commonly say, “Ah get over it, toughen up” “You shouldn’t let this or that affect you”. “You have nothing to be depressed about”. Guess what? Depression, anxiety, and addiction doesn’t need a reason. Furthermore, showing your emotions is a sign of strength and not a weakness. It takes more strength to show your emotions and feelings than to hide them. In addition, men have been taught to hide their feelings and remain stoic. They don’t want to appear weak or less than. Sometimes I’ll wake up sad for no reason. Honestly, my life is absolutely wonderful and I have so much to be grateful for. I literally have zero reasons to feel sad or depressed. However, there are some days where my head feels heavy like a thick gray cloud. My thinking is muddled and the world feels like its caving in on me. I can’t explain it. Some days are just like that. I tell myself that this too shall pass and it always does. When I’m in that fog though, it feels like the world is ending. It is hard to function. I then get mad at myself for not having the energy to be productive. In these tough moments I need to remind myself that it’s okay.

I take paxil to help with anxiety and depression. There is nothing wrong with taking medication to help you feel normal. It doesn’t make you weak! I’ve also used meditation as another way to calm my mind. Another key ingredient to keeping myself in tip top mental shape is exercise. Exercise is the number one thing I can do in my life to help keep me healthy in general. It really is that simple. There’s a trickle down effect. Exercise releases the happy endorphins such as dopamine in the brain. I also use a lot of positive self talk to keep me in good spirits. The mind is very powerful and will believe everything you tell it.

If you’re feeling down or struggling with addiction, nobody is going to shame you and those that do aren’t worth knowing. The people that care about you most will support you. They will respect you, and they will be happy to see you happy. If you’re feeling low, please call a friend or family member to chat. Friends and family have saved me many times over the years. There is no shame in admitting you need help. We’re all human, and we all need help sometimes.

The last time I was sober for more than a month at time was 5 years ago. Even so, sometimes my addiction has been mild and I have been able to go a couple weeks without using, then will use every weekend, then go a couple more weeks.

&#x200B;

Most recently, I've had pain over a guy and I have used to get through the pain. We were seeing each other exclusively, I fell in love, he pulled away. He used me for sex and took advantage of me when I was feeling bad, but he didn't rape me. He said horrible things to me. I went to the ER a month and a half ago because I wanted to kill myself. Then I began using like crazy. I saw him again and things ended, badly. He was bad, but I did things I really regret that I don't even remember. I sent him tons of texts and posted mean things he said to me in a very public way that hundreds to thousands of people saw.

I used a ton and got sober when the drugs ran out 4 days ago. Now I'm not sure what to do. I've destroyed my reputation, I've hurt his reputation (though I never lied). I hurt my job .I'm depressed and I don't know what to do. I know I want to stay away nose drugs and pills not prescribed to me (and alcohol even though that's not a problem drug for me). But what do I do besides that?",5

2019-12-17 10:40:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ebxdio/leveraging_diet_to_overcome_withdrawal_symptoms/,Leveraging diet to overcome withdrawal symptoms,"I was an everyday toker for years. If I missed a day I would get extremely nauseous, irritable, complete loss of appetite and absolutely no sleep - just night chills and sweats. Then a diet change led me to an invaluable discovery of how to drastically reduce those symptoms. It is the main reason I was able to quit.  I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and if anyone else would like to try it for withdrawals from other drugs?

I will try to keep this brief. Basically I started eating a very low-carb diet (ketogenic diet). When you severely restrict carbohydrate intake, your body will eventually go into a state of ketosis where your body runs on fat instead of glucose. You can read all about this elsewhere, but essentially it's a different way of fueling your brain and body. Many folks experience boost in energy, mood, mental clarity and a host of other benefits. 

When I stopped smoking while in a solid state of ketosis, my withdrawal symptoms were about 10% of what they usually are and were gone completely in a couple of days. This was a GAMECHANGER.

Why did this happen? I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps it has something to do with THC being stored in fat and then that fat is released in ketosis. I don't really know why it worked, only that it did. What I can say for sure is that being glucose fueled vs being fat fueled is a completely different experience as a human being. You can read about people's experiences and positive effects of changing to a low-carb diet all over the internet. Dom D'Agostino is doing some really interesting research.

Now I know people probably scoff when reading that I was addicted to weed, but let me assure you the withdrawal symptoms were horrible for me. This little bit of leverage was the extra help I needed to actually quit and better myself. Now I'm very interested in exploring if this could help with other withdrawal challenges, specifically heroin. 

If you are interested in this, want to try it or discuss it or anything, DM me and let's talk. It doesn't cost anything to change what you're eating and this could potentially be a new way to fight addiction.",2

Ive stayed away from stimulants for maybe half a year at this point and a lot of that is thanks to me being 100% sure that they will very easily ruin my life if I touch them, and I was lucky enough to get caught in a binge earlier on in my use of those drugs and ended up in a psych ward and then impatient rehab and had I not been I was ready to seek out meth.

Try and follow me.... 
I have been a drug addict since I was 19. I’m now 39. 
Currently I’m in the local methadone program in my town. I’m on 90mg of methadone. On top of methadone,  I hate to admit but I do Methamphetamine. I’ve done meth since I was 22, and have had a few breaks. I currently have had a break from doing meth for about 9 days. That was the longest I could go. I do not do well without meth. I’m bipolar too and use it to self medicate on top of my normal psychiatric medication, which I’m on abilify mantainum. Without meth, I have panic attacks and major irritability and even get homicidal. I found that I cannot do this myself at home. It’s too much for me. 
I’m looking to getting off methadone and go onto suboxone and also getting off meth for good. 
I was considering and wondering if I could do this detox in a mental hospital so they can monitor me, I’d be safe, and my mood swings would be monitored and medication would be distributed for my mental illness. Is this possible? Ideally I’d like to get off everything but am afraid I’d go back to heroin if I stopped any form of medically assisted treatment like methadone or buprenorphine.

2019-12-14 17:09:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/eaq500/my_food_and_money_spending_addiction/,My Food and Money Spending Addiction,"At the start of August, I had $1,300 in my bank. By the end of November, I had only $100 left. Majority of it I spent on food and some on video games. This is my story. 

I'm 22 and still live with my mom. The reason I live with her is because it's close to the college I go to. Saves on time to get to there so I figure might as well. The reason I mention all of this is because I don't pay the rent. We figured it'd be best that she pay rent while I go to school and pay for books. My classes are payed for by a grant so we don't have to worry about that. 

Eventually, during my third year I received a letter from the school saying that I owed them over $4000 from a loan. At first I thought it was just a scam so I ignored it. But I then started getting calls from the same people. And once I had a conversation with them I realized that I had accidentally gotten a loan from them my first year of college. Your probably wondering how do you ""accidentally"" get a loan from a college. Well through college trickery. When I first was going to college, they gave me a to do list of things to do. One of them was to pay off the entry fee. And one button said it would all be paid. I assumed that was the grant. Since I was having a slight mental breakdown at the time, I agreed to it. The same as accidentally signing a deal with the devil. 

I had to pay off the loan but I didn't want my mom to find out. She had enough stress on her plate. So I talked to the loan company about making monthly payments. The only way for me to do that was get a debit card. Another deal with the devil. 

I went to my bank, got the card and set up automatic payments. But then I realize some thing. I could order food through Grubhub and all that. So I did. Again. And Again. Eventually I spent it every week. $30-$40 every other day a week. I have to be honest it was nice at the time. My mom wasn't at home as often because she worked so she wouldn't be home for when I would receive the food. She wouldn't know. 

I started from $1,300 to $500 in just 2 months. At that point I knew I had to stop myself. I figured I could get a job to make up for the lost money. But I got lazy and then started spending it again. At the beginning of Dec, I had only $100. I then started to go actual cold turkey, but then my bank statement came in the mail. My mom was furious. Actually more than that. She was the most angry I've ever seen her in my entire life. At the time I was with my dad (They're separated) and received the call that she'd receive the bill. She said how she didn't ever want to see me and was going to barricade the door so I wouldn't come home. 

I know a majority of you are probably thinking ""It's your money. Why should she be mad about that?"" Well instead of spending the money, I should have been spending the money to help her out. She has major bills left and right. She even vented to me how she needed help to get more money to help pay for things. She never asked for money from me, but she still hinted at the fact that she needed financial help. Plus there's the loan that I should have been spending the money on. 

My dad was informed on the conversation and was also really mad. I told him everything. My spending habits, the loan, how mom needed the money. He recognized it as an addiction. He had recently recovered from a drinking addiction so he understood that I needed help. My mom and dad discussed ways for me to make it up. My dad dropped me off home and they went into further discussion. She seemed to have calmed down and was understanding. The next morning, she did a complete 180. 

She told me that she was up all night crying about how selfish and self center I was to do what I did without a conscience. We argued for hours. She said she was going to move out and never wanted to deal with me again. It's been two days since she moved out. I've tried to apologies but no matter what I say or do, she will never forgive me. And I now know for a fact that she won't. She's described me as a monster and even says that I can't be her child. My mom has been mentally abusing me for all my life. She's been going all out to make me hate myself more. 

Yesterday, she drove me to the point where when I came home I tied a noose out of a extension cable, wrapped it around the doorknob and had the other end wrapped around my neck. I wanted to do it. I have no friends, no family, no one who loves me, no purpose for life. But something inside of me didn't want to die. I stepped down and tried thinking on the positive side for the rest of the night. 

I know my addiction comes from my depression. I know that my addiction has hurt everyone around me. I know I can replace my addiction with something healthy. What I don't know is how to get people to forgive me for my actions. I know actions speak louder than words when it comes to forgiveness but my mom tells me she cries herself to sleep and all day. How can I get someone to forgive me when that person REFUSES to want to believe me. I want to do anything I can to prove I'm sorry and I'm more than my addiction.  

My dad has been searching for therapy.  And my mom is about to stop by. I don't know if I can handle what she says to me. I don't even know if anyone will care enough to help me. I just want to know if I am a monster or not..",2

This update isn't as positive as I had hoped it would be but let's be real.. Addiction doesn't give a shit what we want. My sister in law has been with us for 9 days now. And it has been a fucking roller coaster. For the sake of brevity, I'll put info in a bullet list so I don't get rambly.

· after discharge, she swore she would be ending things with her addict boyfriend. She didn't, they are trying to work things out, against our (asked for) advice.

· her ""best friend"" is a married man with kids, the one who bought her $200 of heroin that she brought to our house. He has morphed into this clingy, manipulative, emotionally explosive person and puts her in the position of having to reassure and comfort him with her attention. He is not allowed at our house and her boyfriend does not know that they talk, and the best friens thinks she broke up with boyfriend. She is keeping enormous secrets from them but refuses to step away from the drama.

· after deciding to stay with the boyfriend, we told her he is not allowed at our house. He is on house arrest except for work, from 6am to 8pm. In the 9 days she has been out of detox and moved out of his house, she has only actually stayed here 3 nights. The other nights she has slept over at her boyfriends house, also against our advice. 

· she hasn't been able to get into the methadone clinic, her first day back she overslept and missed her appt so they gave away her time slot. They told her to come back Thursday (yesterday) but when we got there they turned her away saying that they told her wrong and she has to wait until this coming Monday. 

· after 2 attempts to get in, her boyfriend offered to get her some suboxone from a friend. All their friends are addicts/dealers. I told her that whoever brings them suboxone may offer something else just to be a dick, and she should prepare herself to come face to face with drugs again. She ignored me, and spent last night with her boyfriend, and again tonight. 

· the nights that she stays with him, we don't hear from her at all the next day until close to 7pm. We have asked her to contact us at some point during the day to let us know if/when she's coming home so we can plan dinner, or plan to spend time together, or anything. But she'll come home as late as possible, spend the day sleeping, and take off again. At first we let her know we wouldn't control what she did as long as she stayed clean. But after 6 of 9 nights away from here, we have let her know that she is either here or there, and she needs to choose.  We need basic communication.

I know that she has to adjust to life again, so I have tried to limit my expectations and just take things day by day with the hope that something will come of it. But she has made no productive choices, she is letting her friend and her boyfriend manipulate her into doing what they want.  She told me when she and her boyfriend are having sex, he won't pull out when she asks. She is defending him saying that he ""isn't trying to get her pregnant but he isn't not trying either"" which is abusive and controlling and everything under that list. 

I guess I just need to know if giving her an ultimatum is too much at this point. My husband and I have done our best to both help her and give her the freedom to make her own choices, but at this point we are feeling taken advantage of and manipulated. We have told her our feelings but the behavior hasn't changed. We have no proof of drug use but we have no proof that she hasn't used either. We just don't know and I refuse to accuse her without a solid reason. I know she will get drug tested Monday at the clinic but she can easily tell us that it's clean because we legally don't have to know, I think. 

There have been several other instances and miscommunication but they have been solved so far by the 3 of us having an open conversation and coming to an agreement. This ""here one night gone the next"" and no contact is our biggest issue, and I feel stuck. I texted her and let her know that we would like to talk to her tmrw. I just need to know that we are doing the right thing I guess.",1

He stopped smoking, was happy, enjoyed life, said he doesn’t miss smoking one bit, until now. 

I wasn’t much suspicious when he started to hang out with friends more often and began sleeping more frequently because, well, I thought everything was good. I trusted him.

About 30 minutes ago, I went out to our garage to workout when I saw a bag of weed behind some tools. My heart LITERALLY split in two. Memories of when he’d ignore me, curse at me, say he hated me all came back to me. 

I first confronted him saying “What’s this...?” He looked at it and replied “I don’t know, I..” 
“Was this you, Jonah?” I interrupted. He just hung his head and nodded it. “If you need help come to me. I won’t tell mom. This is your choice.”

Later realizing that wasn’t enough and that I should help him more, I told him to come to my room. “J-Jonah.. why? W-what happened” I said in between tears. He told me he screwed up and he’s not “addicted” so he can easily stop. I told him I’d check in with him and help him as much as possible. I promised him I wouldn’t tell my mom, yet. 

Please PLEASE help me. I don’t know what exactly I should do. I’m thinking that after about a week if he’s still smoking I’ll tell my mom, I don’t know. Someone help me.

I am prescribed 100 mg of pregabalin three times a day for chronic pain/restless leg syndrome.

I get a blister pack once a week by a mental health team that delivers my medications (this is because I've had multiple suicide attempts  over the years).

Anyways, a few weeks ago I started taking more than prescribed to manage the pain/restless leg syndrome/anxiety and to escape my troubles.

I have now gotten myself in a situation where I only have 37 pregabalin to get me through eight days when I should have 48 to get through that time period.

I'm scheduled to go out of town for a two day medical assessment and just don't know what to do.

With the amount of pregabalin my pain/restlessness/anxiety will go through the ceiling.

If I tell a medical professional what I have done I know I will be taken off the pregabalin and most likely have my medications dispensed twice daily by nurses.

I have been abusing Tylenol/codeine too and have gone through that too quickly as well.

I really feel ashamed too and like I have broken everyone's trust. Just don't know what to do at this point.

The thing is, I need the pregabalin and Tylenol/codeine for my health conditions.

EDIT: Since this time last night I have gone through 11 50 mg pregabalin (550 mg), 250 mg more than I am supposed to have in this time period. Just had 100 mg an hour ago and already feel like I need more. I can't though. It's just a terrible mess.",6
2019-12-12 14:22:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/e9s74o/addicted_to_addiction/,Addicted to Addiction,"Addicted to Addiction

Unemployed, 29 years old, laying in the back seat of a borrowed car littered with fast food bags and cups in the parking lot of a casino you hit your ATM withdrawal limit for three days in a row, most everyone thinks you are working to become successful because that is what you told them, and you are staring at a pack of cigarettes you just bought. 

You are faced with the realization that you are not a bad person. To you, you’re the hero. But the reality is that you are addicted to addiction. Whether it be physical with cigarettes, food, or pain or mental with gambling, video games, or lying, you love the feeling of feeling addicted. It’s freeing in the most binding sense.

If you are reading this, I’m sorry. This is mainly a letter to myself to deal with something that I’m not even sure is a real illness, but if you want to wire transfer me some money to sit at the Let It Ride table, I wouldn’t oppose it. I can’t.

Honestly, I’m not sure if I want to. I made up this little world in my head where money doesn’t matter, and it’s not the current world my body lives in. It is a struggle between the outside and inside world that manifests itself into being hedonistic in whatever pleasure seeking situation comes out with no regard for my mental or physical well being.

I prefer the world in my head. I don’t think I’m taking a big leap to say that everyone has their own little world. It’s a blessing and a curse that we all have as humans. We can think beyond what is in front of us, and it sucks. It causes unneeded levels of stress, social anxiety, and destructive tendencies.

However, it’s not all bad. It gives you a sense of being free in the most binding way possible. To be completely entranced by the end of a cigarette, or the kill streaks awarded after a good run of game play, or the chiming of the bells alerting you that you just won a whopping $.80 on your $10 bet, gives you the feeling that in that moment, you are winning.

And sometimes that is all it takes to be able to keep moving on in life. To feel like you are worth having around, and, even worse, an actual credit to the society that so many of our kin have worked towards to make it better and freeing. 

But fear not because that free-ness is a curse. With the ability to live free and have a minuscule fraction of the responsibility the founders of our modern day society, we are able to use that beautiful, bitch of a brain we all have. You ever wonder why it seems that some of the dumbest people you know are the happiest? 

I doubt the point I was trying to make at the beginning of this article made it to the end. Probably because as I was writing this I was addicted to the writing. It didn’t matter of the sentence structures made sense, or if the thoughts flowed. No, the only thing that mattered was the feeling I had from putting words onto this Google Doc. I became addicted to it, but that moment has passed. So. Onward to find my new addiction! I hear that there is a Sushi Buffet down the street. Keep me in your prayers.",58

Well, a week ago my parents went on vacation which meant free reign for me. I’d get up, walk about 2 miles to the liquor store and buy a 5th of vodka. I did this for 7 days straight.

One day I took a nasty fall on my back. My body began to break down on me.

The night before my parents got home I decided to quit cold turkey. 

Mind you, I vomited once the last night I took the last drink. The next morning I was already convulsing and shaking so bad. Hearing noises and seeing things that were there.

I’d drink water then feel nauseous. Here’s where it got fucked up. Twice I went to the bathroom and vomited straight blood. Not just a little either.

My sister in law brought me in almost immediately. Blood pressure was 200/140. I was so dehydrated and could hardly support my own weight.

Today’s day 2, I’m comfortable thanks to a great staff. All CT scans came back okay. I’m on a liquid diet and getting pumped with fluids and likely to. Be here at least another night. My hemoglobin levels aren’t fluctuating so I’ve has a ton of blood drawn

It was during finals of Grade 11, 4 years ago. I somehow got a prescription for Adderall from my doctor, and took 30mg that night. 
About 2-3 hours after taking the 30mg of Adderall, I began to hear the ringtone of someone FaceTiming me from my laptop even though no one was calling me. I thought I could hear someone on FaceTime with me so I kept checking my laptop but no one was there. I hallucinated my boyfriend hanging from my door by a rope. I knew I should’ve been scared but instead I kept staring at the hallucination, wondering how it was possible. It seemed so real. 
I don’t remember how I got into my bed or when I fell asleep, but when I woke up the next morning to check on the chemistry notes I was supposedly writing last night, I found out the scariest thing of it all- what I thought were chemistry notes were really about 20 pages of me writing my thoughts. I didn’t know how that could have happened when I was writing chemistry notes all night- somehow I was writing down my thoughts and random words the whole time. Pages and pages of random words and disconnected sentences that made no sense. I look back on that night and still can’t figure out what the fuck happened. How did I think I was writing chemistry notes for 10 hours when instead I was writing down gibberish? Why didn’t I realize I was writing down absolutely random things? Why did I have visual and auditory hallucinations? Why is there a huge blank stretch in my memory where I can’t remember how I got into bed and how I fell asleep despite being on Adderall? 
If anyone has had a similar experience, or can tell me what I could have possibly done to go through that, please tell me.",3

I’ve been prescribed adderall for 4+ years, and I’m currently on 30 mgs + 5mg dex booster. I started abusing it about 2 years now.
About a year ago I started noticing that I’ve become slower at every. Everything is boring now, can’t go through my course material as fast as before, not even as fast as premeds. I can’t finish most of my exams, for some reason I’m always slow. 

A few months ago I also started experiencing an occasional headache around my left temple, and it would feel like my vein was bulging. This tends to happen when I take addy while not being well rested. Also whenever this happens, the adderall makes me feel even worse, i get sleepy, lethargic and experience mild anhedonia. 
Most recently, sometimes I start to feel something physical going inside my brain, either my frontal lobe or around my left temple. It’s not a headache, but I don’t know how to describe it. 

Not only that, but now I am doing a 5th year at university, and barely passing, I used to be an A student, even before I started adderall. 

There are other awful side effects of course, but these ones got me worried the most. 


So my question is, do you know if it’s possible to recover from such cognitive impairment by quitting and/or taking supplements?

How can I ask my doctor for help without sounding like an addict and have him cut me off immediately?

* The first 24 hours are the worst but so long as I don't relapse the strongest urges will be gone
* Should I complete 3 days I'll no longer have the ""Not get energy drinks?  Get energy drinks"" mode of living
* After a week the idealization will fade an energy drinks will no longer be the highest good
* Should I keep getting energy drinks everyday I'll remain on the strongest urges everyday
* Any other relapses will only make my life worse since I'll go back to the intense phase

Like I was worthless, a shitty person filled with remorse and guilt, surrounded by bad and toxic relationships. Like I didn’t matter, like everyone would be better off with me being dead, like it doesn’t matter I’m already too deep there is no getting better... I hated those times, I wouldn’t wish the madness of addiction upon my worst enemy.


I don’t know who needs to hear this right now, but YOU MATTER! YOU MATTER SO MUCH, THE WORKD WOULD BE SO DIFFERENT WITHOUT YOU. YOU ARE NOT A BAD PERSON, I PROMISE! You are just a good person who has made bad choices - happens all the time! 

Fill whatever void felt within yourself with SELF-LOVE, HONESTY (to yourself and everyone around you), and GRATITUDE.
If you’re reading this, YOU’RE STILL HERE. YOU’RE ALIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY FOR THE LIFE YOU DESERVE.

Do not for one minute settle for less than your TRUE worth - something only found after long periods of self-love.
Addicts are by far the most intelligent, resourceful and able people I’ve met - both during my use and my sobriety during meetings. What we lack in the area of moderation issues (lol), we more than make up in other ways.

YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY. YOU DESERVE TO FEEL LOVE AND BE LOVED. You can do it anytime you want, you just have to want it for yourself first and foremost.

I wish each and everyone of you the most positive vibes and love I can possibly offer. YOU MATTER.

Some called him an industry plant from the beginning, as he was that ahead of the times with his music. My focus is not on his accolades as a musician, artist, human being, but the demise of the man taken to soon. 

It was no surprise that he had struggled with addiction, he was often very open about his drug abuse and history with drugs. Lean/codeine and pills where his thing, along with smoking herb and drinking alcohol. His sudden death brings up the question of how and why? He stated earlier this year that he was done with Lean for good, after scaring his girlfriend and himself with his addiction. But was that truly the end of his use of codeine/cough syrup/lean, what happened behind closed doors? It was known he had a percocet and xanax problem, with more details coming out about his last moments of life on that flight from Chicago to California, and ultimately passing upon arrival to the hospital, with witnesses on the plan stating he had popped unknown pills thought to be percs. It will take some time for the toxicology report to come out, hell, we may never know the exact reason for his death. But it is my best guess, his seizure was either drug induced or he was experiencing withdrawals from opiates or other drugs.

Will his death and experience with drugs impact the younger generation to rethink their use of pills, lean, etc., and shine a light on an addiction issue that is getting out of control in the US? Or will this get swept under the rug like so many other problems that our modern society is dealing with when it comes to addiction, sobriety and use of alcohol and drugs?",43

Hi my name is Bliss and I was addicted to heroin for 5 years and suboxone for the following 2 years. And that is non stop daily use, I was not sober a single day for 7 years straight.

Short snysopsis of my history: When I was 21 years old I moved far away from home. Met a bad boy felon who I married within 3 months. Started using heroin with my husband daily, for 5 years. The relationship was abusive and he had a lot of psychological and health prpblems. I lived in tons of shitty places and had tons of jobs that I got fired for either stealing or my drug use. I was pregnant 3 times and used through them because I didnt know or didnt care. This resulted in 2 miscarriages and 1 preterm son I gave birth to, who lived to be a month old before he passed away from sepsis.
After 5 years, we moved back to my parents across the country and within 3 months my husband was out drinking at a buddies house and was playing around with a shotgun. Played his favorite game of Russian roulette but this time when he pulled the trigger he shot himself in the head, was pronounced brain dead and died 3 days later.

I am only putting this out there because 
A) it feels good to talk about it since I do not have many people who know this about me
B) to let you know that all humans suffer in some way or form and even though this can be seen as traumatic, I am still alive. I have been sober for 2.5 years.

I know it doesnt matter what others say about recovery. It doesnt matter to an addicts mind. I remember thinking ""Yeah you got sober but you don't know me. I just can't do it!"" Many think they cant, that they are different and their struggles are different. The thing is addiction also makes you entitled, believing the universe revolves around you and when you suffer, the world will come to an end until you feel better. This is the problem of thought and once someone feels entitled they feel their way is right, that they are the center of the universe. Its not just addicts that think like this, its much of society. 
However, we need to suffer, we need to feel pain to feel bad to be able to turn it into something we learn from and something we grow from. We must try to put the long term high above the short term one. When you stub your toe for the first time you feel pain, so you know not to go around kicking tables or walk into things. You learn and thats a beautiful thing about existence. 

Now that I am sober, I can feel and smell and see clearly. And even though its not all roses it doesnt matter, because thats just part of the human existence anyway, sans addiction. I have had a new wonderful partner for 4 years, a great salary job and have positive, meaningful friendships. None of them care about my past, that I was a junkie who put myself through hell and could not be trusted by anyone close to me. So I just leave my past there, thats the wonderful thing about it, it can stay there and you do not have to live it anymore. 

You can find support offered everywhere but the only support that gives you an answer is the one from yourself. Its a frightening, scary step to take but you have to fight against gravity holding you down, you just need to pick up one foot and step forward. Then the next and over time you will be running, you will be light. 
Humans are amazing creatures, just suprise yourself.",72

Quick question.. kind of..

Back story..

I have been addicted to cocaine, ritalin, adderall, heroin, and a few others in my life time. I have been clean for about 3 years for all the more hardcore drugs and clean from adderall and ritalin for about 1 year.

All the upper drugs I took were amazing at first, but my crashes got harder and harder. Cocaine would put me suicidal during the crash.. Weed also used to be amazing, I could smoke blunts all day, but after the harder drugs (may be all the lsd I did too?) Weed makes me very anxious. So to the question..

Any time I watch movies with hard drug use, I get very anxious and find it difficult to watch, it's like I get flash backs to the major depression I would encounter after crashing.. does this happen to anyone else?

He has a high profile job and refuses to go to any type of Rehab. We did get him to attend a few NA meetings along with my wife and I but he stop saying he ""can't relate to those crazies"".  

Last week, our younger son (works as a waiter) came to us saying his tip money was missing ($300).  We looked at Jay's tracking info, contacted him and he lied about his location. When confronted he came clean and told us he had taken the money as well as funds from my wife's pocketbook.  When he came home from his bender (two days later) We told him he had to leave as we could not trust him to be in our home.

 Yesterday he contacted us, asked to talk, he had a long list of thing he ""wanted to discuss"".  We met at the Starbucks and he went through his list stating how living on the streets has opened his eyes.  That he has spoken with friend who had drug issues and is going to church, etc.  He then said  he didn't have a drug problem, he had an intimacy problem. That he had a hard time meeting women which led to depression and only used the drugs to meet women (Prostitutes) for sex.  

My wife wants to let him back into the house. I'm skeptical:

1. He wasn't really on the street, he was staying with friends. - I think they want him to leave and now he realizes he will be on the streets.

2. I think the 'talk' was all a smoke screen to get wife wife to let him back in the house.

I no longer want nor do I feel I need alcohol, since it was actively ruining my life, but weed has occupied a grey area where I feel if I only smoked socially I probably won’t have an issue. I tested that today at a meetup with friends.

Honestly the first puff was nice and I took a few more when it came around. I even recognized my limit where the high feeling would become unbearable before it hit me and declined another pull, which is different.

The loss of control actually felt disgusting. Like I felt physically ill from how it was affecting me, but fortunately it wasn’t enough to noticeably change my behavior and end up in me making a fool of myself. I can’t remember if that’s always how it felt because it used to be that any chance I get I’d take a blunt, not really considering how it made me feel, and I think now that I’ve been clean a while I can recognize it’s actual effect rather than worrying about maintaining the high.

I don’t really know why I’m posting this here. I still don’t feel right after smoking and I don’t think I’ll do it again, but then I don’t know what I’ll feel tomorrow. I suppose it just scares me a little and I want other addicts thoughts. I’ll have to tell my sponsor at some point as well.",2

Anyway I’m going into my 10th year of sex addiction. I’ve wanted to stop for 10 years. I’m very much in the Christian church and religious but I want to stop. I feel like anytime I go to church the pastor has something for me built in but he doesn’t know. It’s really bad because I started into ddlg as a thing as I’ve gotten older. No experiences yet, just images and community, but it’s opening me up to other things like being attracted to the pastor’s 18 year old and even my just out of high school nieces. This is definitely out of control. I don’t want to have these urges. I pray about it and they are still there. I think I need a miracle but I’m not getting one. I fear I’m just a step from losing my wife and kids if anyone finds out.",25

Insomnia is building up sleep deprivation.  Cut caffeine in half to help and am now loosing my mind, insomnia is worse, and I am literally in physical pain.)This isn't very lucid.  I'm so tired.  I can't sleep and need advice or at least to rant a bit.

For at least the last few years (maybe longer, who knows how this stuff starts) I have smoked weed (flower, hash, dabs, whatever) nearly everyday and have gone through many periods where I was probably literally high (or at least trying to be) for weeks or months on end.  Sometimes I would drink more and sometimes less, I don't think I was ever addicted to alcohol, I just sometimes got to where weed wasn't calming me down or relaxing me enough so I'd drink, too. Or I couldn't get weed so I'd drink, especially to relax.  Though there were also times when I would get drunk every day, sometimes for weeks (maybe more?) on end.  I never drank like I smoked though.  I used to budget for it.  I had the money to drop a grand or more a month on it for some years.  I used to by so much hash I'd make figurines out of it.  Anyway, I've accomplished a lot in the last few years despite all this but as time has gone on I've realized I could probably accomplish a lot more if I were clear headed.  The big problem is that I don't seem to be able to sleep much without being high and/or drunk.  It took me awhile to realize caffeine might be the culprit.  I think I may have created a very serious habit of smoking more and more throughout the day or at least at night (and sometimes drinking) and needing this to sleep then waking up and drinking a lot of coffee to wake back up.  I had a very stressful job near and sometimes in a warzone for many years and in those days I would drink maybe 12 of those Nescafe packets and sometimes a Monster or two daily, then smoke and sometimes drink at night to sleep and start over again the next day.  I left that BS a couple of years ago and calmed down a lot but I think I still have this kind of cycle, just reduced.  A month ago I asked my GF to take my weed and hide it from me because even though I wanted to take a break I'd just convince myself it was just a little and it was ok and I'd smoke again, even during the day, not just to sleep.  It was causing problems in our relationship.  She didn't know, but I'd also sneak out to a local bar on the corner where they'd serve me up a glass of whiskey when I walked in and I'd pound it and leave.  Some days I did that more than once, but this wasn't normal.  In the last month I've drank only once (most of a bottle of wine, which I seriously regretted as it made me quite sick and for some reason also seemed to tear my throat up for a few days, I threw up with a little blood and it hurt, felt like I had a knot in my throat for a week or so).  I only realized today it's been a month, I'd thought it had been two! I'm not sure when I decided to reduce my caffeine.  I've quit before along with everything else for a month or two but it literally put me on my ass for a month and I'm working now and can't be whimpering on the couch or in bed for a month.  The weed and alochol were unpleasant to quit but just cutting my caffeine in half is literally painful.  My body hurts, my stomach hurts, sometimes I'm nauseous, it makes me want to smoke so bad it's crazy, I can't sleep and when I do I have nightmares where I'm enraged and figthing people over stupid shit or where I'm afraid and people are trying to hurt me. I didn't even think I was drinking that much caffeine anymore!  I'd cut back over time to 2.5 tablespoons of Brazilian Melitta Intensity 8 for what made me a large cup and half (450 ml or 3/4 cup) and seemed ok but without weed or alcohol I needed every advantage to conquer my insomnia so I cut that down to 1.5 tbs.  Maybe I did that a week ago, maybe two.  I didn't think it would be a big deal so I didn't take note of it.   I want to eventually stop with caffeine altogether .  Really, I just want to sleep, have a clear head and energy!  I've struggled so much inn the last few years to learn two new languages, leave an extremely stressful but lucrative job, leave a 10 year dead end marriage, get my associates, and travel.  I did all that with my addictions but it was hard.  I want a less stressful and more productive life.  I need to sleep and be able to thinnk and bbe calm during the day.

Any advice? Input?  Other Reddits I should hit up?  Websites, resources? I'm working 6 days a week teaching English online.  I need my mind to function right.  I have 6 classes today and slept MAYBE four hours after weeks of very little and very low quality sleep.  I know I have to pass through a bad time before I feel better, I just want to make it through better on the other side.  I want to see wants underneath all this stuff and even out.",4
2019-12-07 02:47:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/e7bljr/drugs_a_short_story/,“Drugs.” (A Short Story),"“Drugs.”

We’ve all said it. You’ve been telling someone about something tragic or crazy that happened - it could even have been about someone you both know. They were shocked and asked you, “How did this happen?!” “Drugs,” you replied. You probably even said it with a sneer or a healthy dose of righteous indignation. I’ve done it, too. 

The first person that I told when I knew that I had a problem told me that I didn’t. Not really. They told me that if I had a problem, I wouldn’t still have a full time job, a house, a car, and a healthy social life. Only if I didn’t have those things, or if I had killed someone with my choices, would I have had a problem. My addict’s brain loved to hear that denunciation of my demons and so I ran with it. It would be three more years before I admitted to myself that I had a problem again. 

I used to work in a facility that did drug and alcohol screenings for people who are on probation. I sat in that chair and I interacted with “society’s worst” offenders. You always hear people talk about how there are no bad people and just bad choices but you never truly know that until you meet them. You have to talk to them and cry with them and hold their babies while they walk into a room with a stranger to prove in the most intimate way that they are still worth saving week after week often for years on end. If you were in my shoes, you would do all of that from the “right” side of the desk while also in the absolute depths of alcohol addiction. 

“There are no bad people, just bad choices.” I love to hate that phrase. It’s true in so many ways and yet it still puts into people’s minds that addiction is a choice when it’s not. You can argue it and you can disagree, but you can also be so completely DEADLY wrong. Addiction never starts with the choice to partake in your vices. 

I met a girl one time at that drug testing facility who I will never forget. We were the same age almost to the day but she looked at least ten years older than me. She would have been gorgeous, too, if her beauty hadn’t been stolen by the nature of her addiction. During my last week, she came in and was actively tweaking. She knew she was going to fail her test and that she was going to have a warrant issued for her arrest the same day, so she decided to use very heavily before she was taken in. It’s honestly a miracle that she didn’t overdose because I’ve never had anyone test positive for as many different substances at once as she did that day.

Knowing that I was about to leave the facility for other employment, she looked at me through jitters and tears and said, “I bet you’re sick and tired of dealing with all us f****** addicts. You know you’re so much better than us and you don’t want to be around it anymore.” She caught me off guard and cut me to the quick. What could I tell her? That we were the same? That I was battling my own issues? That we were the same person in the same place who picked different poisons? How could I tell her that we were in the fight for our lives together and that it was purely luck that I wasn’t in her shoes? I couldn’t tell her. And I didn’t. But I was able to tell her this:

“I pray every night that my people will choose another rock to die on.”",6

I’m a college aged kid who has been using drugs since I was 15. But I may be too far gone. 

Unfortunately I started using kratom for recreational purposes over 2 years ago and have used it daily since. There have been days to weeks where I have quit but eventually pick it back up no longer than 2 weeks later, which turns right back into daily use. Over the past 6 months or so, it has been increasingly easier to find adderall than it was a few years ago in High School. The stimulant effect mixed with a moderate dose of kratom seemed to level out the highs and lows that come with amphets. As my addy addiction started growing I found myself plowing through a months worth of 30mg ir, within 4 days. About 2 months ago after eating up multiple peoples scripts, I found out about benzedrex. This turned into daily use on days I didn’t have stims. I am now trying to get myself out of this shit storm that I created for myself. I am at the point, where I wish I never tried drugs in the first place. Like I said earlier I have quit stuff before short term, but I have never been this deep. Unfortunately I do not have many people I can turn to to help because I have done this before, and promised I would quit. I guess the point of this post is to vent/get some feedback on any similar experiences anybody else has went through. Any specifics that helped you stay off these substances for good. And hopefully serve as an example to not get as deep as me. Drugs can be awesome but misuse of them can be seriously harmful.

I hope you're well. I am a psychology student and fellow recovering addict. I am currently doing my dissertation exploring the long-term trajectories of people in recovery from alcohol problems.  I chose this topic because I am extremely passionate about recovery and hoping to promote it at University.

I need your help!  I am looking for participants for my study. If you live in the  UK, you are aged 18 or over, and you have been in recovery for at least six months-- I kindly invite you to take part. You can complete the study online, it should take less than 15 minutes, and **you can enter into a draw to win a £50 Amazon voucher!** Plus you will be helping to promote recovery to those in active alcoholism.

I am almost half-way through, so thanks to all the Redditers who have already taken part; you really are awesome.

Thank you all for your time and patience, I really appreciate it :)

I was very depressed for a long time and my household was dysfunctional. I think I started smoking to escape from that, which is why it spiralled out of control. I was smoking all day, every day and it was all I could think about. I’d feel extremely anxious when I was dry or about to run out. I tried quitting many times to no avail, until finally I decided to smoke my last joint. I told myself I would make it at least one year before smoking again. 

I’ve read that weed isn’t inherently addictive, that there must be external factors causing the addiction, unlike with many other drugs. Seeing as how my mental health as well as the state of my household are both infinitely better, would it be feasible for me to smoke (once I hit the 1 year mark) and be able to manage my use? I would smoke once a week in the evening, after my responsibilities are dealt with. Or is it like with alcoholism, once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic?",3
2019-12-05 17:38:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/e6p09a/brother_is_an_addict_need_advice/,"Brother is an addict, need advice","My brother has been a drug addict for years. He's 38 years old and has been in and out of prison his entire adult life. When he's not incarcerated he works as a painter. He most recently was released from prison in October of 2018. Our older brother has rental properties in our home town. He allowed our drug addict brother to stay at one of the properties for free on the condition that he does some painting work at some of his properties. During the course of the arrangement, my drug addict brother fell off of a roof and broke his leg very badly. The accident happened in march of 2019, and he has not worked nor paid any bills since the accident. Our older brother has asked him to move out since he's not able to provide any rent or fulfill his end of the agreement any longer due to the injury. Our older brother has also had to put up with the drug addict breaking all the windows at the property he's staying at, the drug addict didn't pay the water bill and turned it back on himself after they came and shut it off resulting in a $1,200 lein on the property from the water company which my older brother will no be responsible for. On top of this, the local city officials that oversee rental certificates called my older brother and inform him that emergency services responded to an overdose at the property my drug addict brother is staying at.

The cherry on top is my drug addict brother somehow thinks he deserves to be paid out for previous work being done before his injury before he willingly leave the property. He had survey again yesterday and was supposed to stay with out mother to heal, but instead stormed out of the hospital to get back to our brother's property before the locks could be changed on him. Our mother went over last night and saw him and some girl nodding off in the living room with drugs and foil laying out in the open.

The drug addict brother is on probation, so my question is, is there any good reason for me not to call his probation officer and inform him of the situation? My mother is not willing to do anything to help, she babies and makes excuses for him. Our older brother is at his witts end and is checked out. Hes been threatened, harassed and black mailed by the drug addict brother. Hes not willing to help in any capacity. 

I feel like everyone is treating this situation with baby gloves, when in reality hes going to either kill himself or lose his leg because he's more interested in getting high then his recovery. His PO can at least get a court to mandate him to treatment. I dont see any way that hes going to willingly ween himself off of these drugs.

I haven't done anything hardcore, but I've been smoking weed or drinking copious amounts of liquor every day, without a single day missed, for the past 2 and a half years. I've had multiple attempts at quitting, all of them failing. I'm not addicted to any one thing, but moreso addicted to being under the influence of something. To escape sobriety.   


For the first time in a very, very long time, I've not spent my last check on weed. It's been somewhere like 8 days since I've smoked which is a HUGE accomplishment for me. I bought a bottle of liquor to ease my way out of the marijuana psychological withdrawals which were horrendous to say the least. Depression multiplied, cold sweats, suicidal ideations, extremely vivid nightmares (indistinguishable from reality) that left me super shaken up for the rest of the day— I felt like I was going mentally insane. The booze didn't help as much as I thought it did and only made my problems exponentially worse. I finished the rest of the bottle last night. Luckily, my last experience with booze wasn't a good one, so hopefully that makes things easier.

&#x200B;

My life's been falling apart since I started this two and a half year binge. I'm 21 and my entire set of teeth is rotting away. I wouldn't be surprised if people thought I was addicted to meth. I have most of my teeth in my mouth, but I'd be surprised if there was a single one without cavities.   


I don't want to draw the blame away from myself, but I've self-diagnosed childhood trauma-related ptsd. I work in the medical field and have access to self-assessment forms that allow you to score a series of questions from 0-4 (0=not at all, 4=extremely often). A score of 31-33 is generally the cutoff point, where anything lower may be something other than ptsd. I scored a 56 when answering with complete honesty. I've got to a psychiatrist but he wrote ""He's 'pretty sure' he has PTSD. Diagnoses: anxiety and depression."" He didn't question me, assess me, or refer me to anybody. He slapped me with some benzodiazepine prescriptions (which I threw away) and called it good.

I'm sure the above had a huge influence in my binge and while I thought I was treating it (which may have been the case with responsible marijuana use), I was only making everything several times worse. I've developed a sort of agoraphobia (related to the ptsd)— when I hear footsteps outside of my room my anxiety would spike and I'd find myself unable to leave even if I had to pee. Because of this, my room has become something out of a hoarder's nightmare. It's unthinkably bad. Unspeakably bad. The good news is that I've bagged 11 full-sized trashbags, but now I need to pay somebody to get rid of them for me (I already have a local independent business in mind, but I *am* a bit worried because pretty much all of it is unsorted trash with recyclables and liquid-filled bottles). There's probably around 17 or more full-sized bags-worth of trash left in my room.   


My life spiraled out of control while I was busy getting under the influence, but I want to dig my way out of this hellhole. I was able to curb the worst of the marijuana cravings with alcohol this time around, and for the first time I told my roommate I didn't need a ride up to my local dispensary this time around. It's such a small accomplishment, but I'm really proud of myself. It's the first instance of self control I've had in a very long time. All I have left is alcohol to worry about. Good news is I'm broke until a week and a half from today, so buying more of either is impossible.  


I guess what I'm asking for is any kind of advice. Anything at all will do— what do you enjoy doing sober? How can I learn to WANT to be sober? How can I curb the craving to be inebriated long enough to escape this addiction? What can I do to start cleaning my room? I'll take anything I can get at this point. I'm worried I'm going to destroy myself if I don't end this now.

I hear you in songs I listen to, I see you with everyone I know, you are everywhere. Your friends with just about everyone in my life and I know I will never be rid of you. The thought of never consuming you again is daunting and hard, while the thought of being consumed by you is terrifying yet easy. You'd be so easy to just let win, but I'm kinda stubborn. 

I must remind myself consistently of why you are no good for me. Not let myself be fooled into thinking it can be different. Because I truly know it cannot. It's not just you, alcohol, that I have this problem with. There is no misunderstanding of my insatiable hunger for more. It's never enough for me when I give in.

to start off, its never been just stimulants. im a poly addict and ive just come to realize this recently. before i tried stimulants my freshman year, i was mostly robotripping a bunch, taking random pills and smoking a loooot of weed and cigarettes (after i quit cigs i switched to vaping nicotine). but when my buddy got some ritalin, he gave me 3 10mg pills and i loved it. 

since then ive been on and off addicted and abusing RX stimulants (had a lil relationship w coke at a time too)since i was about 14-15. im 17 now. about 3-4 months ago, i was hospitalized after my mom found me in my room blacked out (i had taken an unknown amount of dxm and 4mg clonazepam) very stupid i know. i hate myself for putting my family through that. but after that i quit abusing drugs like i was; i was taking some sort of pills everyday, along with smoking a lot of weed. also vyvanse (usually) almost everyday on top of that.  i tried to quit cold turkey, and the first 2-3 weeks were hell and i could not do it. 

ive been high almost every day and i could not cope. i took benzos and amphetamines a few times through that week, along with dxm a few times. then i had a talk with my girlfriend, and i realized how fucking stupid i was. i was hurting everyone that cares about me and her especially. she’s the first person in 2 years to even somewhat care about me like this. and i was repaying her by lying and getting high.

after that, i really committed to it. i stayed sober from all that hard shit. before this i was smoking all day every day, and i even cut down on that. i saved it for when i actually need it; when i cant sleep (which is every night bc i have real trouble sleeping, but still it was actually when i need to not when i want to). 

i felt better in the aspect that i was clean and making better choices, but i still had really bad anxiety and depression. i know its probably from all that drug use, my own fault, not anyone elses. but i kept with it and ive been taking lsd and mushrooms recently for self exploration and healing purposes, and i feel its done a lot. and i actually feel like im getting better. 


i dont know why i wrote this but no one really knows the extent of my drug use/addictions except my girlfriend. and no one knows the actual state of my mental health, not even her or my family. i dont think i can tell them how i feel. i dont want them to know all the bad ive done and how bad my anxiety/depression is. i think itd actually break them to know what ive gone through. i just wanted someone to know, even if just one reads this.

also, be fucking careful with stimulants man. i thought cuz it seems so innocent that i wouldnt be doing too much damage to my body. but i didnt learn until it was too late. be safe be careful everyone. thank you",3
2019-12-03 12:22:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/e5kbsr/think_you_have_a_gambling_problem_losing_all_your/,Think you have a gambling problem? Losing all your time and money to gambling? Don't know where to turn? Please read on. (This post is also on my website),"It goes without saying, but the first thing that anyone can clarify with any Compulsive Gambler, is that they have spent far too much time and money on gambling for their own good - and in most cases, the good of their own family and friends too. Sadly, to brand an established addict as an idiot or a waste of space is still somewhat prevalent in modern society, and there still isn’t enough widespread awareness on what addiction really is (albeit some progression) - it is an illness! It’s an illness so bad that I cannot emphasize the affect of it on a person or their relatives enough, so please don’t assume that the reason you have wasted your time and money gambling is because you’re stupid. However, do know that, something needs to change, and if you can’t stop gambling at your own detriment through willpower and self-discipline (despite vowing to yourself that you will), it’s probably time to admit that you have a problem I’m afraid, and you will need to go out there and get help. Trust me, you will feel so much better for it. I’ve been there myself, and I know it’s not easy to stop, and you fear what those close to you will say, however, every time I lost more than I could afford, it felt much worse than the previous time I did it. Can you relate? If you can, let me tell you that you have not seen the last of it if you don’t own up. Put it this way, would you rather admit being consumed now, get help, significantly reduce your chances of going through the pain again, and restore yourself back to normality? Or would you rather continue to suffer in silence, waste your time and your money, perpetually behave like a walking monster yourself, see a rise in relationship deterioration, encounter endless employment issues? Or even worse; Sectioned? Prison? Death? – No, I’m not being dramatic. That’s what rock bottom really is here, and that’s where this addiction will take you if you don’t arrest it. Just one month of recovery, and you will be amazed by the weight lifted off your shoulders, so trust me, it’s worth it, but it requires effort, willingness and honesty.

No one ended up in recovery without realising and accepting that they are powerless over their urge to gamble. Moreover, when one really becomes fully immersed into gambling, everything changes, and it becomes far more than just “I’ve lost all of my money and I’m really upset about it”. This illness isn’t even about the money, money is just what fuels it. If I could only gamble with candy or buttons, I probably would have. It’s an emotional illness, and it’s like having a monstrous dictator living inside you, controlling your thought processes, your emotions, everything - and preying on you when you least expect it, and this is why an addict suffers time and time again, despite promising yourself that you would never go through that pain again. Have you noticed how huge wins won’t stop you? Well there you go. A good recovery will help you detain that monster living inside you, and help you keep a lid on its mouth. However, do note that it’ll always be there, but can be kept quiet with the right help, effort, and above all, the desire to stop gambling. This is no overnight process, it takes time and effort, but before you know it and to your own surprise, you will find yourself restored to a normal way of thinking and living.

So how does compulsive gambling mess you up? Your brain rewires into this complex, psychological third dimension, with a flurry of (mainly) negative emotions and debilitating thoughts. It’s like a minefield of negativity and self-destruction, all taking place inside your own head. Although most gamblers know that they’re unhappy away from gambling, I/they think that, while in action (as an active gambler), that the problem is with the world around us, and not with ourselves. Generally, a compulsive gambler has a strong desire and urge to be ‘The Big Shot’, and I personally felt smart and obscurely intelligent whenever I won big (stupid, I know!). As well as that, you can’t accept losing, for obvious reasons as well as egotistical ones, but someone like myself can hardly tell themselves that’s it time to go; not until I have either lost everything, or have recuperated my losses for that episode of gambling.

Compulsive Gamblers become accustomed to wanting everything for nothing, only accepting having things going their own way, and refusing to admit fault at times when it is – and that comes from the ego. This factors in greatly as to why when a Compulsive Gambler loses a bet, no matter how big or small, they end up fluttering away more and more in a bid to regain their losses; generally, a compulsive gambler feels the need to come out on top all the time. Conversely, as mentioned earlier when a Compulsive Gambler wins, they’re still unlikely to stop because no amount of profit is good enough, and that’s something a gambler won’t know until they have won their initial target. As well as that, the thought of your winnings being spent and gone (even on useful things) just doesn’t quite sit right. Therefore, an addicted gambler would go and gamble more to win back what I/they have spent, because we’ve won big before and we enjoy the good things in life for free, so why wouldn’t we, and ‘why couldn’t we do it again’… - (This is one common way the monster inside manipulates you).

I cannot emphasise how important it is to establish that addiction is an emotional illness, and an addicted individual would turn to their source of compulsion as an escape from their own minds a lot of the time. Before I explain this, let me just say that an addict recovering properly can thwart these temptations by speaking to the right people, resilience, an understanding that they are powerless over their desire to gamble (in this example), going to anonymous meetings, and working the 12 step recovery programme. You may hear that an addict had acted out their habit because they were ‘Triggered by boredom, an argument, anger and frustration over something, had a break up, a bad day in the office, or anything that happened that day that induced stress ‘– there are circumstances in life that will annoy you or ordeal you, but you cannot pin it down to one or two things and say ‘I would not have gambled if that hadn’t happened’, because in reality, you don’t always need to be in a bad mood to get you going. Sometimes, one might even gamble as a celebration for something, so even though life does indeed give you lemons, it is ultimately an excuse at the level your habit is at. These inconveniences or ordeals are just used as excuses by that monster living inside you as justification to encourage you into doing your habit again. To summarise: Once you become addicted, there are no small circumstances that can be blamed for as triggers, no matter how woeful they may have made you feel, because you were always going to act out at some point anyway. At the beginning of this insidious illness, it may well have erupted through a traumatic or distressing event, or through some sort of bad influence, but it’s no use looking back on what started it once you’re addicted, your primary focus has to be to stop, and to put the effort in and get the right quality and quantity of help to stop! Willpower and self-exclusions alone are futile on the long run if you are a gambler like me. They can work for about a few weeks, but a gambler knows how to adjust situations like this to their own desires, and that resilience to stop gambling will eventually burn out if you’re on your own. That’s why meetings, counselling, openness with close ones, and admitting lack of control is crucial, because you’re never going to beat addiction if you’re quiet about it. For some, rehab might be necessary also.

To conclude: If you can relate to any of this, make today a turning point in your life by admitting what you have done to someone close to you – or even your doctor. Does that feel like a difficult ask? I understand, I was there myself, but you will be pleasantly surprised to see the reaction you do get when you tell your closest ones. I would also start researching your local gamblers anonymous meeting as soon as possible too, it will be the best decision you make for the rest of your life. Nervous or apprehensive about that too? That again is understandable, but if you can go through the pain this addiction has given you already, then you really have nothing to be scared of here. You have lost far more than you could afford to already at this stage of your habit, you’ve seen your life fall apart, so just ask yourself, how can walking into a meeting consisting of people who gamble just like you talking about gambling, make you afraid? Bring a trusted one with you too, if you feel like you need to. Like after a workout at the gym, completing an urgent chore, finishing your homework when at school, it’s a massive weight off your shoulders once you own up to what you have done.",1

Lately, it's been harshly affecting his health. Just a few months ago he was hospitalised and nearly died 3 times because of it. The doctors told us if he drank anymore and prolonged coming to the hospital, he would have been dead. It was a miracle he could even get past his liver failure. But since he got out, we were all hopeful he would have gotten the message and stop drinking. However, we suspected he started again. He smells a bit like beer, and he started going on drunken rants again. My brother found a whole pack of beer in his mini fridge this morning..

So what should we do from here? Should we try staging an intervention and try and encourage him to seek help at a rehabilitation facility? Should we chuck his beer when he isn't home? It's clear to us he either doesn't understand the gravity of the situation, or he does actually want to die.",1

I’m 21 years old and since i was maybe 15 i’ve been around and used various substances. Beginning with weed and cigarettes, ramping up now to cocaine, ecstasy, xanex. Generally anything that i can get my hands on for cheap.

I thought i had it under control until maybe the start of this year when i went through a really bad breakup and started using really heavy to escape my feelings . It started off as a bit of fun but eventually ramped up to drinking nearly everyday and using cocaine every 2-3 days. Big benders on weekends with more ‘party’ drugs thrown in the mix. Unsafe sex all the time, generally self destructive behaviour.

I’m posting because i feel stuck. I need advice from people who have gone through this. I’ve been to the docs and talked to my parents about it but every week it gets to friday and i lie to myself and say i’ll go for just one drink, only to end up out partying til sunday. I hate who i’ve become. I’ve lost my job and my family life is all over the place because of it. I look 5 years older then i am. I really want to stop but it seems as soon as i start to feel better after a couple of days without coke, i want to go out and do it all again. I don’t know how much longer i can push.

I feel i may need to move away. I live in a small enough city where literally everyone i know is into partying or dealing drugs. I cannot even go on a tinder date because as soon as they bring up drugs in conversation i am in the toilets begging my dealer to drop in a gram ‘just to get on the buzz’. I hate it.

Anyway, today i try to get sober. For real: i’m terribly sick and tired of who i am. Of the anxiety and depression and shame and regret that comes with this horrible drug. I just need some guidance and advice right now because i feel so lost. Thanks guys.",3

This post will be a glimpse into 23 years and counting, of dealing with a demon that I have come to recognize as 'ADHD.'

Like every good Redditor, I looked into the basic societal rules of interacting with the vast Redditsphere. One thing I am known for and something I am looking to avoid off the bat in my first post, is making sure I convey my story, but in a cohesive and concise manner. Cohesive and concise are two words that have never ended up making their way to my vocabulary, but alas, here we try..

Background:

\- 6' 2"" 250 lbs caucasian male

\- 23 years old

\- Graduated college in 2018

\- Working full time in a standard, high paced, 9 AM - 5 PM job

\- Diagnosed for the first time with OCD/ ADHD in 2014.

\*\* The following blurb is meant to be a general guided tour through my progression with ADHD and provide a lens into the sickening journey this little ""glitch"" in my head, has become \*\*

In 2014, I was. diagnosed with OCD and ADHD from a doctor who had as much care for their clients as two strangers do in passing. After a 10 question quiz and a few questions, off I was to little did I know, the ultimate tailspin of my life. See, ever since I was a child, my parents could have told you that I was different in some regard. From shuffling my feet every 10 minutes or when I stepped on a crack in the sidewalk, to twitching my head 3 times in a row furiously in what seemed like 2 hour increments, or even the pestering of my parents if the thing or surface I touched was going to make me sick if I were touch my tongue to my hand three times, muttering the noise, ""eh eh eh,"" it was clear that there was something in me slowly making itself noticed.

Fast forward to 2014 when I finally got diagnosed. What finally got me in the patient chair in that douche of a doctor's office, was the constant battle I was having in my own head. Every time I watched a YouTube video, or browsed over someone's social media content that I knew, I convinced myself that I had posted something there that would get either myself or my family in trouble. It haunted me. I had to back track every single time to the precise moment I had imprinted in my head when the ""crime"" was committed. I had to brush my tongue at night 7 times in a row while thinking of the number 7 and if for whatever reason I visualized the number 6, I was convinced that someone I knew was going to die as result. The best one was having to kiss my childhood dog's ashes 7 times in a row while muttering the same prayer over and over in my head until I was able to confidently visualize the number 7 in my head. Again, if 6 came to play, I would be in for a long evening.. Years of this continuous battle is what prompted me to seek help and lay the next stepping stone to this story.

With this diagnosis came the luxuries of starting my own medication regiment. This first comprised of Fluvoxamine for my OCD and Addy + Vyvanse for my ADHD. Lets say I enjoyed the high of my ADHD medication a little too much along with the added benefits that come on the side. Raised grades, profound focus and energy, lost weight.. it was magical. I loved every bit of it. This came to a halt after 2 years when I decided to stop taking all of my medication altogether because I felt ""normal again."" Sike.. welcome to college G. After a two year hiatus from taking medication, college came and immediately triggered the same mental tug-a-war that I was playing just two years ago. Alas, I started my regiment again under the same doctor. Except this time, I had found a way to get myself dependent on chewing tobacco and smoked weed fairly often.

College came and I found the same magical benefits from the ADHD medication that I did when I first started it. Addy combined with nicotine and being able to smoke myself to sleep at night after raking in the benefits during the day? Sounds like a healthy lifestyle to me. My self medicating of the Addy started shortly after my first year in college, taking upwards of 100 mg a day. When I would run out, I stole from dorm mates and friends and becoming very clever with my alibi's. With an increase in my addy came an increase in my chewing tobacco, and thus an increase in the amount of weed I smoked. This trend carried on for the remainder of college, leaving me to where I am today.

I have since started taking Abilify and Chlomipramine in conjunction with Addy and Vyvanse since seeing a new doctor in 2018 when I first started work. I have been diagnosed with major anxiety, depression, ADHD and OCD. I still smoke every night to fall asleep, a habit I have had for 3 years now consistently. I cannot tell you the last time I didn't smoke at night. I run through a month supply of Addy and Vyvanse in one week and have taken to coworkers to buy from here and there when I need a fix or they make it available. I also ""Chew"" one can of Zyn nicotine pouches a day while also drinking the same Starbucks ""double shot"" energy drink every morning, a recent relationship with caffeine that developed in the last year while trying to compensate for the days I didn't have my ""speed"" at my disposal.

I know this is a lot. Jumbled and sporadic to say the least. But this is the outline to a journey that I am having a harder and harder time keeping up with each day. My life seems to be one fixed routine that I am afraid to modify in the slightest. I can go on for hours about what I have been experiencing and my thoughts on it, but I need help from you all with questions, comments, and stories of your own. I KNOW I can relate to each of you and share the love we have for this demon together, but I fear that if I continue writing, this will turn into a 30 page ramble.

All comments are welcomed :)

I’ve recently realized that it’s very likely I am addicted to sugar. I eat sweets throughout the day, on all occasions, and it’s practically muscle memory for me now.

I binge an entire pack of oreo’s, for example, I get a very pleasant sensation, and then I just feel guilty and anxious and overall like shit about what I just did. But I keep going. I’d classify that as addiction. Worst thing is, I’m pretty sure I work better (as in I am more productive) when I eat sweets, which is how I always justify it in my head. But I know it’s wrong. And I need to stop, otherwise I will definitely end up with diabetes and will just hate myself for the rest of my life.

I was wondering if anyone on here is going/has been through a sugar addiction, and if you’d like to share your experience. Also, if anyone has any tips for overcoming it, I am all ears. Anything helps :)

Have a great day!",5

It's to the point where I can't go a day without my regular dosage (60 mgs.).  I'm only prescribed 40 mgs., but a family member provides me with extra pills when I feel I need them, which has become all the time.  I don't know how to live my life without this medication.  I've tried to go without and all I want to do is eat and sleep.  Life just doesn't seem as vibrant and full off the Adderall.  Any suggestions as to how I can combat this illness? Thanks.",27

I've slowly been destroying my life piece by piece for a long time. I'm absolutely miserable. I have no one, not even myself. How can you believe or count on yourself when every part of you seems to want to go towards destruction. There's so much that I have to work on and rebuild. I don't even know where to start. Every time I think about it or start to work on myself, I get so fucking overwhelmed and give up. It seems hopeless. I know Rome wasn't built in a day. Got to do it piece by piece. Going it alone just feels so exhausting. I got very close to starting to self harm last night. Night before last I kept punching the steering wheel till my knuckles were bleeding and bruised. I look at who I've become and can barely look myself in a mirror. I feel brain dead, yet I'm so furious inside but it's all locked up. I've tried getting help with a therapist. Didn't do much. Medication is not the option. I'm no guinea pig. I have no idea whats wrong with me or how to explain whats going on inside, so it's almost impossible for a doc to know whats wrong. I just give up. There is no purpose for me anymore, yet I'm too much of a coward to ever just end it. I'm pathetic, wallowing in my own self pity. How do you rebuild a life from scratch? How do you get the ""want to"" to do something about your problems? I don't really expect any real answers to these questions. Ultimately only I can find the answers to my problems but ironically I AM the problem. I live in a perpetual paradox stuck in the abyss, in limbo, just waiting for death.",3
2019-12-01 16:55:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/e4ohmg/alcohol_coke_and_the_strange_case_of_dr_jekyll_mr/,"Alcohol, Coke, and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll, Mr Hyde and Tony Montana","Robert Louis Stevenson wrote [the novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde) way back in 1886 about the time cocaine -- a pain reliever already in use by dentists during oral surgery -- came into fashion as both [a body-wide pain killer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819571/) and a ""mind-expanding"" drug used at least on occasion by such as [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud). (Yes, the ""Coca"" in Coca Cola *was* a small amount of cocaine back in those days.)

I was conversing online with someone who had been involved with a romantic partner who was (and may still be) addicted to both alcohol and cocaine... and how that so often turns into almost exactly **the combination of polarized behaviors** seen in Stephenson's novel, especially as it was brought to the screen to considerable box office success by MGM in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. I've never seen the silent version, but I have seen the classic talkies with Frederich March & Miriam Hopkins ([1931](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022835/)) and Spencer Tracey, Ingrid Bergman & Lana Turner ([1941](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033553/)) several times. 

Overly fantastic period pieces they may be when viewed almost 80 and 90 years later, but the display of [**dissociation**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/bmbq66/misunderstanding_the_meaning_of_dissociation/) induced in an already compulsive and dark character with narcissistic traits via the **disinhibition of [neocortical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocortex) control** over the [limbic system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system) produced by **alcohol** and the greatly increased **compulsivity and aggression** produced by **cocaine** works for me as a pretty straightforward explanation of the toney and competent Dr. J's transformation *over time* into the increasingly depraved and callous Mr. H. 

Or... one can watch Al Pacino's ""Tony Montana"" in Brian De Palma's ""[Scarface](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/)"" (1983). Tony was never anything but a thug. But his ice-cold, lizard-brained [psychopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy) was enough to keep his behavioral train *on* the tracks until his drinking and snorting **disinhibited** and **over-stimulated** his brain to the point the train jumped *off*.",6
