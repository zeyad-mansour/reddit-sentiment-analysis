2022-01-30 21:03:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/sgpcif/my_story_and_my_recent_positive_mental_health/,"My Story And My Recent, Positive, Mental Health Improvements (Trigger Warning: abuse, mental health)","Greetings, divine redditors...

I know it's a bit long, but I want to, as briefly as I can, share my story and experiences with you all, as well as being glad I got through these things, so that I can now celebrate and be proud of my small achievements.

Just for a quick back story... I had a pretty rubbish upbringing, divorced parents, a toxic relationship with my father and step mother, bullied at school, no friends, diagnosed with various mental illnesses at 12 years old and in and out of mental health services/social services till I was 18... 

In 2014, just after my 18th birthday, I entered a 4 year long relationship with a man who physically, sexually and emotionally abused me for the whole time, we had a child together, who I lost custody of and haven't seen since they were 2 years old. 

I left the relationship at 2018 when I was just turning 23, I moved in with my mum, and even though we had quite a toxic relationship while I was growing up, I think not seeing me or speaking to me for four years during my abusive relationship, worrying about how I was being treated and not knowing whether I would end up dead, completely changed her and changed how she was towards me and it also changed how I was towards her, as me and my mum have always mirrored eachother and brought out the best and worst of eachother and during those four years, we both changed and grew a lot as people ... 

But a year or so down the line, mine and my mum's relationship broke down which resulted in me becoming homeless. Not only was I suffering badly with my mental health, (PTSD, DID/personality disorder, psycosis and depression) but I had also just quit my job and had no money, I wasn't speaking to my dad so couldn't stay with him and I became homeless during the beginning of the pandemic, so not only was I at risk of catching covid, but I couldn't go and stay with my Nan, who was probably the one person that would have had me live with her rather than being on the streets.

I ended up, thankfully, being put into temporary accommodation and also had the pleasure of meeting my fianc√©, who I have been with for nearly two years now, but on the downside, my addiction got a lot worse and a lot heavier and my mental health was at its very worst, especially as I had no therapy or counselling for the previous domestic abuse and I was still dealing with the pain and trauma of all of this alone.

Then December 2020, at 2am, I was physically assaulted in my local high street, and never recovered mentally from this 

My addiction had improved so much before this had happened, I was on Espranor (which is like subutex) and had cut down my use massively, but after this incident, I fell straight back down that dark hole of allowing myself to be cuddled and cared for by drugs and just numbing the thoughts and the pain that came to me everyday.

Since then, I haven't left the house really... Out of the 365 days in the year, I had probably spent about 50 of those, properly outside of the house and that's it, I have to go to my pharmacy everyday and go to mental health appointments every two weeks, but that's as much as I can cope with.. 

I spent most days in bed, watching TV or flicking through social media because I cannot physically get out of bed, I just have a complete block, my brain won't allow me to do anything else, I'll stand up and prep myself, ""right, screw this, I'm going for a walk"" and instantly my body will respond with, ""ooft, I'm feeling absolutely exhausted, I can barely keep my eyes open, my legs hurt, I need to lay down and sleep"". 

I completely let myself go. 

I will go days without washing or brushing my teeth, I won't cook for myself or eat proper meals, instead I'll spend my day eating a few packets of crisps/chips, a microwave hotdog, crackers with butter/soft cheese, yoghurts, chocolate, brownies etc, I won't tidy up my flat or wash the dishes, I barely do any laundry (which I don't really need to do anyway because I'll either wear the same tracksuit bottoms and jumper all week or just wear my PJs), I'll ignore all my phone calls, ignore my partner, not show any affection and be completely selfish. 

Occasionally, I'll have 2 or 3 days where I'm full of energy and motivation and self love, I'll have a shower and a shave, wash my hair, brush my teeth, pamper myself by wearing a face mask, doing my nails, I'll put on nice clothes, go to the pharmacy, do some shopping, take a walk, cook some nice food, be affectionate and attentive to my partner, give my flat a spring clean, do all my laundry, and then bam! After those couple of days, I'm back to being stuck in bed.

I ended up getting put onto regular medication, anti psycotics, anti depressants and sleeping pills, which allowed me to get control of my addiction again, as I no longer needed to numb my feelings and emotions, as the medication was balancing everything, as my drug use has always mostly been an attempt to self medicate, I no longer needed to give myself my own treatment, as I was now getting stuff that was doing a good enough job, but then later on in the year, the doctor decided to take me off of everything, saying my mental health was drug induced and completely disregarding the multiple diagnosis' that I have, the 4 years of domestic abuse that I'd been through, disregarding the fact that I've had multiple mental issues since I was pretty much born and have had these issues long before I started doing drugs and disregarding that I was using drugs to self medicate BECAUSE I wasn't getting any treatment for my mental health in the first place. So because of the Doctors wonderful and helpful choice, again, I have gone back to allowing illicit drugs to numb my pain and help me ignore my problems rather than actually facing and/or dealing with anything.

So...At the beginning of this year, I decided that if I'm not going to go out, I need to make being inside, fun, productive, positive and happy, so I figured I would firstly: 

1.Practice self love and self care by keeping up with my hygiene more often, I wouldn't push myself and force myself to shower everyday, for example, but perhaps have a shower every other day, or every couple of days. 
2.I would then take pride in my appearance and also dye my hair and keep up with maintaining the colour, as usually I will dye my hair and then leave it to fade and let the roots come through and not touch it again for another six months, but now I've decided to always keep my hair looking pretty and presentable, touching up my roots and colour constantly or changing the colour regularly rather than letting it fade. 
3.On some days I will dress myself in nice clothes, even if I am only just going to the pharmacy or just going food shopping, I will put on a proper outfit rather than wearing sweats all week
4.I also plan to pay more attention to my partner and if I'm feeling withdrawn and don't want to be affectionate because I'm feeling bad, I will tell him this rather than just ignoring him and I will also work on communicating better and be more open about how I'm feeling
5.But most importantly, I decided to take up 3 hobbies which I plan to dedicate myself to, get good at and hopefully, turn my hobby into a business.

I've started knitting, crochet, and model making/sculpting with clay. I've knitted and used clay before, I have a basic knowledge of each, but stopped doing these things after s few years and decided I'm going to give them a go again and not give up this time, but I am learning how to crochet for the first time ever.

I struggle to dedicate myself to hobbies because I have a low attention span and get bored of things quickly and also give up as soon as the product or result of what I do isn't ""good enough"", I have a perfectionist mindset and expect to be a professional at something, the first time I try it and give up if it's not at a perfect standard first time, but I can say, with pride, that I have stuck to these things and motivating myself to practice and practice and keep getting good. I have a goal in my mind and this time I'm determined to reach it. 

Being stuck in the flat for the last two years has made me feel like a failure and a waste of space, I'm not contributing anything to the world or society, I'm not socialising with anyone and I started to feel like my existence was pointless as I'm not doing any good for anyone and just being selfish and living in my own world, isolating myself from everyone. Because of this, it sparked my idea to start documenting my journey with my mental health and addiction and allow people to follow me on my path. 

Spending a lot of time alone has also made me think about how everything online is so edited and how everything is portrayed in a way that people's lives are perfect and happy and people's appearances are also portrayed the same, so when people like me go online, we feel depressed, envious, insecure, because our lives are often sad and depressing, we go through a lot of trauma, most of the time we don't look our best or don't dress our best and we feel like failures because our lives aren't the same as the ones we see online, this thought has made me want to show people the honest reality of my life. I had the intention to show people that life isn't always perfect and that we can always look sexy and beautiful, that it's completely normal to stay in bed all week and not shower for a couple of days. (I know I discussed the potential of doing something like this with some of you, but I am fully embracing and dedicating myself to the idea now, thanks to all of the positive responses I got from everyone, so thanks to you all for that)

Doing this, like my hobbies, is another way for me to escape and live a fulfilling life and doing this will make me feel like I have purpose again, and that I'm not just a waste of life and energy because it will give me the opportunity to positively affect people's lives and potentially help, support and guide people as well as helping others to feel like they're not alone and that there are people in the world that understand how they feel and experience the same things as them.

As well as all of these positive ideas that I have thought of, which will hopefully improve my life and my mental health, I have finally been seen by a psychologist and starting trauma therapy in the next month... This will be the first time since experiencing domestic abuse that I will be addressing the trauma and pain caused by that situation, which will hopefully help me to move on and potentially, will be the key to getting me out of my bed permenantly and help lead me back out into the world again and give me the tools to care for and look after myself.

Even though I'm restricted because of my mental health and these last 8 years of my life have been traumatic and painful, things are slowly and steadily moving in a good and positive direction and I want to share this and celebrate this with you today ..",1

A lot of times, you'll see people talking about ""I just want to experience the joy and happiness I had before I started using"" or ""go back to before I relapsed, when I was so happy and joyful.""

I do not relate to that at all. For me, really the only true, absolutely amazing happiness I have ever experienced was through substances. Everything else, family memories, times with friends, doesn't even come close to comparing. I've been ""in recovery"" with a relapse here and there for 2 years. Currently living in a halfway house and moving out in a few months to my parents so I can save money for an apartment. After that, my plan is to just work, come home and smoke weed, and rinse and repeat.

The things I enjoy besides doing drugs are video games, pagan spirituality, and playing/writing heavy metal music, all things that the Christian halfway house I'm in frowns upon, as well as my parents. This makes it very awkward for me to go and seek out people who share the same interests, as the House manager and my parents will want to know what I'm up to and dissuade me from it. So, I try to stay in my room as much as possible and not interact with anyone. If I can get by without saying one word to another person IRL in a day, I consider it a victory. I have no idea whether I'm an introvert or extrovert, but I genuinely cannot stand being around people in recovery at all anymore, repeating the same shit over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again-- the quotes from the rooms, pithy non-denominational Christian sayings, talking about how blessed they are to be given the opportunity to be in a halfway house.

I used to have very high aspirations, but I've come to realize they're all nonsense. It took everything in my power to meditate, read spiritual literature, and engage in intellectually stimulating conversation everyday for 3 months, and it still didn't even come close to providing the relief and happiness that a bowl of weed does. I've tried therapy; planning on dipping my toes back in, but my anxiety and need for the therapist to like me prevent me from unloading my true anger, misanthropy, and frustration, so I end up just self-analyzing in the room with them for an hour and getting a worksheet that I rarely complete. Honestly, I just want someone to be able to look me in the eye after hearing every single one of my disgusting, hateful thoughts and seeing the worst of me and say, ""I love you and like being around you."" Even more than that, I desperately want to be able to believe them.

This post has turned into more of a rambling ventpost, so my apologies for that. Hopefully someone sees it and can relate and give me some guidance.

How do you even begin to desire a sober life when the only happiness you've known is drugs and alcohol?",6

When we broke up I decided to get clean and have been doing a lot better, but she called me about 3 weeks ago and told me she overdosed. Her and her friend decided to get fentanyl one night and as soon as she did it she nodded out and stopped breathing. Her friend gave her narcan and an ambulance was called. Luckily she‚Äôs okay.

When she called me she really needed somebody to be there for her and to help her through detoxing and everything, so I‚Äôve been there for her everyday since. But last week I found the same mbox 30s that made her overdose hidden under the sink, along with a rolled up piece of paper to snort it with. Every time she goes to the bathroom I hear her crushing it. She‚Äôs always extremely nauseous and itchy, and she‚Äôs nodding out in bed. 

I‚Äôm worried fucking sick. I asked her the other day if she was hiding drugs in the bathroom and she got extremely defensive and mad. I‚Äôm not here to judge her, and I‚Äôm definitely not judging her either way because I understand what that shits like, I‚Äôm just so concerned about her health and safety to the point of feeling like I need to check her breathing and heart rate every few min when she‚Äôs sleeping. I‚Äôm having nightmares of her dying for Christs sake. I just want her to be okay. 

How should I go about telling her that I know she‚Äôs doing these drugs? I don‚Äôt want her to think I‚Äôm upset with her, or that she needs to hide anything from me.",2

What I was wondering was... When do you realize masturbating was actually a problem? I always thought about masturbation as something completely natural and even necessary.

I never question myself my own habit of masturbating. I sexualize some things from time to time, yes. But besides that (it can be annoying sometimes) it never messed up with my life.

For those of you that have overcome a vaping addiction, how was the recovery process?

From what I understand, getting over a vaping addiction is easier than a smoking addiction, I‚Äôve heard the craving to puff is significantly less after the first week, if youll still feel the craving at all? 

I‚Äôm worried that even after the initial cravings stop, I‚Äôll still want to vape because since I‚Äôve started vaping regularly throughout the day, it no longer has the same ‚Äúzonked‚Äú affect as when I first started. After the initial cravings subside, I‚Äôm worrried I‚Äôll want to puff again anyway to see if that ‚Äúzonked‚Äù feeling will come back after I‚Äôve given my body time to get the nicotine out of my system. What if I‚Äôm just trapped in this cycle of ‚Äúaddicted, get clean, puff again to feel zonked, get addicted again‚Äù cycle for the rest of my life?

A part of me just wonders if it‚Äôs just the addiction talking though, maybe I won‚Äôt even care to be zonked after I get clean? Do any of you have any pointers, tips, or advice from your own experience?",1

I have been battling my addiction for years, some good and bad weeks like all people. 

This week has been tough but I've gotten through, however, this morning I woke up with the strongest of urges I had in months. I was so dam close to relapsing but at the last moment, I thought fuck this and took my ass off into town and now sitting having an early morning coffee writing this post.  I now plan to buy a few things for myself and my partner using money which would've been spent on acting out. 

It may seem like a small win in the grand scheme, but this win feels collosal for me. Anyways, that's my post, I hope it least inspires a few people today who are struggling. The feeling of winning a battle is so much better than the feeling of acting out. 

I wish everyone all the best",23

My dad, 62, is a very proud, admit-no-feelings, self-proclaimed ""traditional"" man. Hes never dealt with any problems in life - hes always just gone with the approach of ""let's not turn XYZ into a big deal,"" hates all things California, loves Fox News, thinks everyones out to cancel christianity....

I realize I've probably also just made him sound beyond saving, but believe it or not when you peel him away from Fox News, he really can actually be a kind hearted, decent individual. He can in some ways admit hes not perfect, just not at the level that requires him to drastically change his status quo in life. He has an immense amount of pride and cant stand not looking like he has everything together when it comes to the big stuff in life. He can be very generous and I do believe he loves his children, not just from a self-serving angle. Hes flawed but hes not evil.

Anyway.... hes drastically thrown himself into alcoholism since his father passed 3 years ago. He didn't drink a drop the entire time I was growing up, but I think now that hes relatively done raising his children, and the undealt with grief of his own dad passing.... hes gone down a very dark hole. Hes passing out drunk IN PUBLIC, getting kicked out of bars.... it's so bad. Hes going to kill himself soon if he keeps going down this road.

I realize rehab only works if people are willing to put in the work and want to change and that it's going to be a tough sell to get him to accept help. But I'm considering arranging an intervention and I'd love some advice on rehab suggestions perhaps specifically geared towards those who find ""modern mental health"" too ""woowoo."" Again, I hear this sounding dumb, but it's where I'm at. 

He is catholic. Maybe there is a catholic rehab that isnt all shame based brainwashing? Ugh. I'm just wondering if anyone has found a rehab that maybe is a little less intimidating for conservative folks, without it being a twisted christian hellscape. 

Thank you. I just wanna at least try to save my dad.",4

Why the fuck can someone have this many wires crossed? Why does God or the universe (I hate questioning God because I was raised Catholic, however I have doubts and I think and hope that is okay) allow themselves to create something that could think like me? How could the higher being(s) create a human that harms other humans? I understand that there are people in this world who are ‚Äúworse‚Äù than me. There are also people who have it harder, and both can be true in one person. I believe both is true in an abundance of people on this planet. There are people who were raised in circumstances that I couldn‚Äôt ever imagine. Nevertheless, there are people who have trauma and are capable of not doing the crazy batshit insane things I do. There‚Äôs plenty of people with trauma who haven‚Äôt punched a windshield during a fight with their parents or gotten so drunk that they fought their dad and pushed their dad and made him fall and bruise his ribs, or forgotten entire weeks, months, important memories, etc. because of drugs. There‚Äôs plenty of people who haven‚Äôt punched walls and thrown shit at walls and threatened to physically harm their mom who they love more than anything in the world and physically harm their brother (who they also love more than anything in the world) during an anxiety attack about something so tiny they have no recollection of how it started. The point is I have done a lot of fucked up stupid shit and my question is ‚ÄúWhy am I the way I am?‚Äù 
     Everyday feels like a walk in quicksand. I feel it is a painstakingly slow process. Occasionally, I allow myself to stand still and sink. Weirdly enough, that is when I feel the happiest. Some would say that‚Äôs a reaction from the crossed wires. I would say that it is my love for self sabotage. For some reason, I fucking love slowly killing myself. Something in me wants me to fail until this endless cycle of self pity, victimization, and self induced torture ends. Sometimes I feel like that part of me isn‚Äôt me at all. I feel like a walking avatar in a video game and I can see through the eyes of the character that someone is controlling. Obviously I feel my body moving but I can‚Äôt seem to control my thoughts. Therefore, it makes it difficult for me to control my actions. This is especially true when I am not sober. The scariest part is that this is also true when I am sober. I know the drugs have had a say in the things I hate about myself but I also know that from the second I could be addicted to something I was an addict. Unfortunately, that was at a very young age. I kept this pattern because these addictions comforted me and helped keep my mind at ease. I didn‚Äôt know I was getting worse. Honestly, for a short amount of time my addictions would make me a better person. I clung onto that short amount of time and continued on as if that was always the case. Everyone can now see that was not the case. Even I can see it now, which for a long time felt impossible for me to do. Of course I knew the long term effects of drug use before I ever touched a drug, but I felt invincible to the reality of drug addiction. A part of me honestly believed that I could never be a drug addict. Regardless of that belief, I was an addict before I even knew what the realities of addiction were. I know that as soon as I gained consciousness, at the age of around 5, I chose to be addicted to things people wouldn‚Äôt typically call addictions. I let small things like activities, ideas, thoughts, predictions, objects, and other insignificant things completely control my life. Drugs (including alcohol) threw me off the edge and created a kind of unrecognizable monster. Somehow, as a monster I learned to adapt and camouflage and deceive. 
     How can I change for the people I love and how can I make my brain want to help the body it is controlling? I want to stop but I can‚Äôt and I want to be myself again but I have no fucking idea who that is. I literally do not know who I am. I am a stranger to myself.
     When I imagine myself in the future I imagine perfection. Even if I don‚Äôt want to reach it, or feel like I can‚Äôt, I still push for that. Still, there‚Äôs a part in me that never wants to reach it. I never want to take the steps to get there. Then I realize that the steps to get to where I want to be are never ending. I see these steps as an endless stairway of problems and obstacles that are too difficult and too long to conquer. I see the happiness but the sadness is so much worse. My problems are thought consuming and this way of thinking has shaped me into who I am now. I am very scared of who I am now. I want to be a completely different person with a positive aura. I‚Äôm afraid i‚Äôll be this negative aura, who is sort of a ghost of a person, forever. 
I hate feeling crazy but I feel crazy all the time: manic, uncontrollable, and fearless in the worst way possible. I hate when I know others can sense my craziness, but it is something I have had to become accustomed to. I can no longer hide my imperfections; the physical or the mental. I feel weak and insignificant because of that. Sometimes, I want to hide away from everyone for days. Sometimes, I want to be around lots of people and be social and forget about the sadness. These 2 events are constant and have increased in length rapidly. The period between these 2 polar opposite events has decreased. Meaning, I am getting crazier and crazier by the second and I can‚Äôt catch up.",2

This was when I had to split from the rest of them; I was done, and TBH with you and not leave anything out. I had been forced to use, which is a shitty thing that others can have no conscious of what they are about to do.

I got rid of the piece of scum that held my youngest son hostage for the eight days he and his friends were shooting me up and making me so highly sick. The last day I would ever have to deal with anyone like that was 07/05/2013. I now have a Traumatic Brain Injury, and I've had a stroke. I was forced for eight months. 

He was trying to kill me slowly, and for what?!?

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for about a year and I never saw a problem with my weed consumption. I was about a year clean when we first met but after a couple months I become very depressed. I had a lot going on at home and at school. I was just exhausted and drained all the time. I decided to start smoking again just to get high. The first couple of times I started using it again was just for fun. But then it got to the point where I started using it when i was having a bad day or just needed to get rid of some stress. I never saw it as a problem because I didn‚Äôt do this on a daily basis and used it as a way to get ‚Äúhelp‚Äù. I would only do it every once in a while. For example, i would smoke every weekend or every other week. It did help me a lot. It made me feel calm and euphoric. And I loved that feeling. Every time I would get high I would call my boyfriend and we would just talk and fall asleep together and I liked that. Unfortunately, one of the times I smoked I had a really bad trip which caused me to hyperventilate for a long time(i dont know how long I don‚Äôt remember much from this night). But I do remember being scared that I was gonna die (even tho you can‚Äôt OD on weed). When this happened I was otp with my boyfriend. He was scared and worried about me. Basically, I left him traumatized. I didn‚Äôt know this because he didn‚Äôt really tell me. So I kept smoking despite of that. My boyfriend had opened up about how he felt about me smoking and expressed to me that he didn‚Äôt like it and that I should probably stop. I told him I would stop so I did. I was clean for maybe 3 months or so. But round October 2021 I got in a big argument with my dad and he ended up hitting me and kicking me out. And within the same week of this happening, I had found out that my boyfriend had been lying and hiding things from me. Basically, he made a secret TikTok account just so he can look at girls, he had many porn accounts, and was basically addicted to porn. This made me upset because during our whole relationship he told me he didn‚Äôt watch porn and that he would never follow girls or look at them like that because he ‚Äúrespected‚Äù me. He also knew how I felt about this. I relapsed because of these two things. But I didn‚Äôt tell him. He promised to me that he would be better and stop lying and hiding things from me. So I promised him I would stop smoking. I was fine until mid December when I found out that he was still doing the same behavior. He also told me that he masturbated to girls from his school, his own cousin, possibly gore(???), and much more disturbing things. This really fucked with me. I would always think about the things he did to me and said to me. He lied to me twice about it, both times promising he would be better. I couldn‚Äôt get the girls out of my head. I would constantly compare myself to them and when he would compliment me I didn‚Äôt believe him because clearly I wasn‚Äôt his type. This would be all I think about 24/7. I would lose my appetite, not eat, and feel sick about this. I was disappointed and infuriated about this. So I said fuck it. I need to smoke. So I relapsed. I relapsed the beginning of this month and wow. I feel like sometimes weed/drugs aren‚Äôt as bad as people make it seem. I felt calm, my mind was blank, I felt peace. For the first time in months. I felt amazing. It really helped me. It made me forget about everything he did. I didn‚Äôt tell him about this time either. I felt amazing. When I woke up the next day I really felt like a whole new person. I woke up feeling content with who I was and I felt happy with myself. I was able to forget about the girls and all which really helped. Unfortunately, just a couple days ago I had confessed to him and told him about the day I relapsed and he was very upset with me. He thinks I have a problem or an addiction because every time I would get upset the first thing that would come to mind is ‚ÄúI need to smoke‚Äù or ‚ÄúI wish I was high‚Äù. He also thought this was a problem because of the fact that I kept doing it and lying to him and manipulating him (I didn‚Äôt realize I did). At first I refused to believe this because of the fact that I didn‚Äôt do it everyday. And I did it because I needed help and I felt like I had no one. Him and I had an argument yesterday because of this. I told him the it was his fault I relapsed. He didn‚Äôt let me explain to him on how I had been feeling and the main reason I relapsed. He lied to me and basically cheated on me. He‚Äôs in active recovery about this. But he gave me an ultimatum. Him or drugs. I honestly didn‚Äôt know which one I wanted to choose. So he said if I wasn‚Äôt willing to try and get better he would leave me. So my question is do I have a problem? If so how can I do better. I don‚Äôt have access to a therapist because of money problems but I‚Äôm willing to try my best with what I got. I just don‚Äôt wanna break up with him  even tho after what he did I did see a lot of growth in him when he actually started to be better. Anyway though, what can I do.",3

KJ 2022

I was hurt, angered and had the urge to never let anyone see what I had gone through. Or if they ever did know, they would have to see that I did not care. This leads me to a black hole spirling with late nights, monotone thoughts and the urge to find peacefulness elsewhere. All I had done to find this love I craved so much was just another repeat of all those before.

This is how I sum up why everything went so wrong. I go through these 4 past experiences of mine to show what I believe is all so intertwined. So if you have the time I think reading my thoughts could be worth it if you too are struggling with drugs abuse, or what we call daddy issues.

I took the route of following the kids who I would never let my future kids come around when I was young. Smoking and drinking was a factor I took into my personality from a young age so I could fit in with those who felt easier to approach for some reason. The kids who were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù felt so mean to me. In doing so my personality only brought in the wrong people, toxic traits and secrets. I couldn't even recall a day when I had not lied to my loved ones. It turned into constantly putting on my familiar face of a girl who loved her family and the little things in life even if it was just a day with sunshine and fewer clouds than the day before. I could be her around my family and childhood friends the funny, energetic and sometimes controlling. She was the real me, the person I was.

Being controlling was the worst trait in my normal self which I realized earlier on. I wanted to change. So I became the edgy girl whom I mentioned before. I became easygoing, laidback and would go with whatever came my way. Which was great in terms of meeting new people and trying new things which some, weren't so great. I had never been one to have elementary boyfriends or crushes. I mostly pretended to fit in with the other girls. I wanted to fit in so badly from the start. So I turned into the girl who instead of crushes and girl talks had a 20 bag of pot on her at all times and only ever smoked it for a show because I hated feeling high and out of control.

My family loved me and looked out for me but I happened to enter the world at a time when they weren't expecting me. Life was busy and they were dealing with future jobs, the future of my brothers and death in the family. I liked being alone, just me and my toys on the floor of my childhood room I was content, it gave me the sense of peace I have when I am left alone and still have that peace to this day. This aloneness gave my parents the feeling that I was mature for my age, independent and able to make good decisions on my own without checking in as often or watching me like a hawk. Which was nice when you are so young and filled with hormones that make you angsty and disrespectful. The more I was alone the fewer teenage problems were on the main floor of our house. But I tended to avoid conversations and any consequences of my actions because no one noticed due to everyone's busy lifestyle.

In being alone for most of the time I had, I downloaded Kik. I sat on my phone for hours texting what I assumed were boys on this Kik app who suddenly showed they were twice my age, threatening to kill themselves because I was 13 and not aloud my phone in class. I find it disgusting that this is now a normal conversation between the girls my age which we all can relate to these text messages sent to our iPods from grown men who were nothing but predators but we were convinced they were our friends.

So after experiencing this so young I was surprised when a boy my age took interest in me.

This boy \*\*\*\*\*\*\* who felt he could see me in his life was somehow for his age a genius. An evil genius. He enjoyed that I had no idea what a healthy relationship was with a man. Whether that is because he was trained by his abusive father or his bipolar mom. And yet to this day I still do not fully hate this boy for what he had done. He had barely finished puberty, I feel that he was just a victim of a disturbing household that poisoned him into the way he was. I hope he has changed into a better man after all these years, I do for his sake and other girls who may encounter him.

Anyways he had once lived here but had moved to Alberta. He texted me through my iPod as well but he was different he wasn't 20 or 30 he was only a few years older than me. He knew people around me and he thought I was beautiful and not in a creepy or predatory way. I began to trust him. He made his way into my life and I left all of Kik's ‚Äúfriends‚Äù behind for what I teenager would consider love. But he ruined me in the end. Not because of a teenage breakup or he had a crush on someone else. He threaten me and my family and leaked private photos of me all over the internet that I'm sure exists to this day, unfortunately. 

I had to learn in grade 8 what the cycle of an abusive relationship was. I had to understand the abuse will last longer, the honeymoon phase becomes shorter each time you forgive your partner and it will not get better. This should have been alarming but my absent adult mind wasn't there to listen to realize it was unfair. Not only did I have to understand the signs and flags of abuse by age 13. I had to learn what consent was, learn what being a victim of sexual assault was, I had to learn what keeping the biggest secret a little girl could have was like from her family.

At this point, I was becoming a master of hiding my own emotions, hidden in a dark place in my mind. I kept this burden of what I had been through to myself and other little girls I had met in school who were my friends. These girls were lucky and didn't understand the memory that replayed constantly in my head. It was difficult for me not to be able to speak about this boy who had taken an innocence, that I believed was meant to keep for a boy who truly loved me. He did not love me, and it did take time to realize that. Talking to anyone who was an adult made me feel unsafe. I felt as though they would say I lied or that I must just regret it. This all happen when a conversation was had with a family member and it was said it was, my fault. It was just regretted and me being a child. I‚Äôm not sure how this adult believed what I had gone through was a mistake that I could have avoided at the time. I was young and vulnerable searching for anyone who cared for me. I so desperately wanted that man to show me, true love. What you call ‚Äúdaddy issues‚Äù started so early in me.

I did not have the chance to be ready, I didn't have the chance to say no and be listened to, I didn't have the chance to get up because his hands pinned me down. I didn't get the chance to grieve because girls my age couldn't put their minds in my position and nor should they have had to. We barely understood what sex was or looked like. Other 13-year-olds couldn't fix my problem but I was too scared to reach out. I carried this weight on my shoulder for years and jumped from one toxic boy to the next. I gave myself up so easily to the boy I had met in grade 10 on the first day because my relationship with sex was so disrupted and disgusting and wanted to fix it and have a different memory. He too was like the boy from before but the honeymoon phase lasted longer and the emotional abuse happened behind my back with multiple girls and yet I knew these girls were there, I stayed because I was desperate to feel loved by a boy my age.

I was 17 I fell for the next boy.  He had nothing to offer at the time but games and sleeping with my friends yet we were successful for a year and a bit. That is probably because I was so used to betrayal it didn't bother me anymore. I gave him hall passes for when I was away to get away with his cheating just so I could avoid the embarrassment I had felt so many times before. I still consider him my best friend because he has never left me. He has grown as a person and helped me deal with my current situation. And I am very thankful for him. He just was in a similar place as I am now. I forgive him. But it just shows how damaged my young brain was. I was so twisted in my ways, that at this point I was letting these men treat me this way. I let whatever gave me one glimpse of joy ruin me further. I was enjoying the damage just so I could experience one moment of love from another. All that damage continued to build into my hidden dark place in my mind. Compressed so no one could see what I was feeling, so I could pretend I didn‚Äôt feel at all.

After I dared to leave these boys behind, a piece of them had never left.

The only piece they had left was anger and disappointment. I went out to find a way to feel relieved. Drinking with friends on the odd weekend, girl talks and wrestling with my guy best friends and being happy for the times we were all together. I was doing what any other high school student would. But I still craved more. I hated drinking past 2 drinks, I hated the feeling that I was out of control which is now so understandable due to how I had experienced no control over my feelings or my own body. One night of my classic high school parties  I eventually found what I had been searching for. I met my dear girlfriend, I still dream about the night we met even after 6 years.

She was offered to me when I was on the brink of feeling out of control. Told it would make me the happiest I had felt in my life. Just crush it with a bill and a card and I was okay. Her name was Cocaine.

They were right. 

I was in love.

I felt euphoric, felt warmth and the best part, she made that deep dark place in my mind shrink to a point where I barely felt the weight that had always hurt my shoulders.

I was okay. I was okay for just once. She made me okay.

The people who offered me forgot to tell me that happiness only lasts for so long, and that place in my mind that shrank will only become darker, denser and larger than it had ever been before.

   They forgot to mention that the first time, I felt this way will never come back.

They forgot to mention how I will never feel in control again.

They forgot to mention I will now understand the phrase ‚Äúchasing the high‚Äù all too well.

The first time is so much better than each time after. You can never feel what you had felt the first night. Every time after just rots your brain to a point where all you can hear and feel is that dark place you only wanted to avoid. But she is the only thing that can slightly silence that dark place that she had made louder and darker in the first place. 

Though I did not discover all of that after just 3 weeks of fooling around with light use with friends on weekends. I learned this after I had completely reached rock bottom and searched for her desperately after 3 years since I saw her last.

A boy who treated me well came into my life and to this day somehow I still love dearly which is only because he was like an angel compared to the rest I have encountered in my life. But he came in slightly too late, he was romantic, kind and gentle. He came after the one year I have blocked out of mind. That had only included one-night hookups with men, a body count number that doubles my age, drama with friends, drugs and booze, hatred towards my family and the worst sadness I had faced at the time. I felt so unworthy of anything good I did nothing but sabotage anything that came my way.

So this boy who was so gentle and romantic was so confusing to me it almost felt wrong. He was everything I had wanted before? Why did I not give in and love him like the rest?

After we ended it I saw his true colours and he was all like the rest but in his way. I had ended up pregnant which did not bother me and to this day does not somehow. The cell I wasted, the life it could have had wasn't worth it at this point in my life.

All I wanted though was not to be alone in it. It was scary to face on my own, scary to once again hide it from everyone. I had my friends but like earlier when I dealt with \*\*\*\*\*\*, they could not understand but this boy who did this could have understood, let me vent, let me know I wasn't in it all alone. It was both of us in this situation but he left it all to me. He once again proved like any other male figure in my life that I am not worth much at all, I need to be on my own to deal, I cannot let my feelings disrupt him or others.

I felt as though I was on that same iceberg that I had known too well after what happened with \*\*\*\*\*\*\*. I use the iceberg metaphor for how I felt when I was in distress and left alone to cope because no one could understand.

The iceberg is cold, numb, lonely and heart-wrenching. This time I hoped this boy would stay here with me. We could be on this floating in the ocean together. But the water had caught up and he choose to go with the chunk that had cracked off and was about to drift away. Even though I was in tears, screaming, and reaching for his hand to not be all alone again. He just watched as he faded into the skyline ahead.

I know everything happens for a reason and I fully believe it is true. I have it tattooed down my spine to remind me. At this time in my life, I felt I had enough, what I lived by for so long was wrong. I went searching for the only thing that made me feel the happiness I believe all others had felt. 

And there she was, on a bathroom counter laid out in the most elegant lines I had ever seen, my girlfriend my one true love was back to rescue me.

But this time was different. The dark place in my brain over the years had spread like wildfire on a windy dry summer day. Burning down every other memory that could have kept me from going off the rails. I was trying to hide from this darkness but the more I used the more I craved the feeling I so badly wanted. This only made the fire grow wilder, it made my darkness try to even reach for my soul. I knew I could never reach the point of peace that I wanted, but 3 minutes with her with a completely numb mind was worth all the money, pain and damage to my friends and family. 

The wildfire in my brain grew bigger and had finally reached my heart and my soul. I was completely overtaken. Completely changed. This went on for months of the same routines, lying to my friends that I was better, then going to my dealer's home and sinking into a couch of complete silence, complete peace, even if it was only a few minutes. I just always wanted to be with her. 

I would head home dismissing my university classes that could have changed my life forever, ignoring my family, skipping meals, losing weight and finally time with her laying in my bed having my last piece of her before bed. 

Sleeping was not an option, the thing about cocaine which I have mentioned before the dark place that has now completely taken over my brain and my soul weeps for more, weeps for me to stare at ceilings and feel every second of every painful moment I have encountered. I had trouble shutting off my brain. I had no fire trucks to burn out this wildfire spreading through my entire body. I would stare and replay moments of pain until my brain had too much, my heart had too much to go on and I would fall asleep with no memory of when I finally shut it all off. I would wake up at 5 pm and go to my job. That was the only part of my routine that I believed was making me a ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù addict. 

My personality turned into nothingness, and not like a regular young adult. My soul now barely existed. I didn't know who I was, why my life was even worth living. I believed everyone around me had also believed that I was only a waste of space on this dreadful spinning rock we call home. I was just an ant, a spec on this rock. No one would notice I was gone. These thoughts took over during October. Not a moment went by without thinking of these constant painful and damaging thoughts. The only thing that silenced my brain was my only source of numbness cocaine herself was saving me. If my mind just shut off for those few minutes I could keep breathing, keep my heart beating, keep feeling alive. So I kept to my routine, though I knew it would only damage me further the help I needed felt so much more difficult to reach.

Eventually, I was honest with my mother and decided to stop, cold turkey without resources. I had reached my end. But Cocaine was one hell of a drug that ruined me more than the other boys had before. I finally let the wildfires she started to burn out and let the darkness that lived for so long in my brain and soul take its path and that was to no longer exist. She had broken me. Just like the rest.

It wasn't in a stage of intoxication, it was simply that all her manipulation cleared from my brain and all I could see was the darkness that had been there, now permanently damaged and darker than ever before. The emotions I had hidden below my brain's surface broke through the ash-covered ground and it was too much to handle.

I let her take my innocence before I was ready. Just like him.

I let her expose me as he did.

I gave her hall passes to destroy my mind, but she was still my best friend. Just like him.

I was once again on my iceberg, alone because of her. 

Now she was telling me to take my life because I can't live without her. Just like the boys on Kik, I met so long ago.

She was a version of them all. She was the worst I had faced. And for the rest of my life, she will follow me. She infected me with an addiction to her love. 

The night before she chose my life was over. I tried one more time to find some sort of stillness but that hadn't worked either. I drank and only was sadder than before. I had deleted all numbers I had to get ahold of her.

All of the emotions just became too much for my conscious to handle and I let my soul defeat me. 

I tried to end my own life. I didn't want to be on this spinning rock anymore.

I ended up in a hospital for enough time to stare at ceilings again. But sober and think through all of the turning points that brought me to what I had become.

This time it was only my fault I had ended up here. Life dealt me a shitty first hand for life and I was not strong enough to win. I tried to blame my parents, brothers, friends and everyone around me trying to pinpoint where it had all gone wrong. There was no one else to blame but myself. I even blamed my parents and how their marriage ruined me, Or that my mom like me, tried to take her life years ago broke me and I convinced myself all of it was true.

Now sober and able to watch what happened to me like a slide show it was no one else fault I was in this position but my own. I chose to turn to my drug. I choose to put that substance above anyone in my life and even myself.

I found love, the love I wanted so badly and it was cocaine that made me feel the comfort I had wanted. But just like all these men who seemed to have fucked me over. Cocaine herself did the same. The cycle of abuse. The honeymoon phase was lovely yet the more I forgave her abuse, the more limited her love became until it was all nothing but abuse. I forgot what I had learned in grade 8, that it will never get better with these abusive relationships unless you leave. But for some reason, she felt so much more worth it.

So here I am today, sober from cocaine, ketamine, acid, molly and all the other substance I used to find someone like her. I am active, healthy, gaining weight, and loving my family and friends above all instead of her. I am in Toronto now, left all connections I had to her. Trying to find who I am without her because I let myself follow her ways, her routines. Everything I knew about myself was an illusion she created.  Just discovering what my favourite colour is was a big step for me, finding a hobby I enjoy was an even bigger step. She left me on an iceberg like the rest. I let her pin me down and take my innocence. I let her get away with damage because all I wanted was just a moment of love. And now I may be on this iceberg alone once again but it feels warmer, less lonely, and I can see the shore ahead. The shore looks like those days I use to enjoy so much, sunny and fewer clouds than the day before. I like being alone and I'm okay to be on this iceberg alone.

Weirdly enough putting it in this odd way of the sappy teenage drama changed my life. I know she was just a combination of all of the boys. I know she took my control, I know she took me in while I was vulnerable. Unlike what \*\*\*\*\*\* had done to me, I can say No and be heard, She is no longer pinning me down because I am stronger. I am a victim of a lot of things but I will not be a victim so her any longer. Her cycle would never end unless I left. 

So I choose to be controlling once again and made her leave my life for the better.",8

I'm absolutely addicted to a person who has little to no feelings for me and I don't know how to put an end to it. When I say addicted, I mean that I check their activity status dozens of times a day to see what they are playing, or listening to, or if they've followed anyone new, etc. I reread our old sappy conversations trying to feel happy but it's bittersweet. I can't do hardly anything without it reminding me of them in some way or another, whether it's a good memory or a bad one.

We used to be together - we've known each other for about 3 years, been together for ~2. We were both overly attached and possessive of the other and decided it would be better to break up, but remain a bit more than friends (cuddling and the like). We stopped being together over 6 months ago. Things were going very well but in the last two months they have gotten distant. We stopped seeing each other for the past two months because they come from a big household of unvaccinated individuals and I didn't want to risk carrying covid to my dad, who I live with. 

We used to tell each other ""I love you"" often and that doesn't happen anymore. They say they have been majorly depressed and want to be isolated from everyone, so I've been trying my best to not message them or otherwise bug them. But I can't shake this fear that they don't want me anymore, when I ask if they want what we have they just say ""I don't know"". 

I don't know how to stop myself from obsessing over this person. I think what makes it all the more painful is that they told me it was really cute that I cared so much that I would check their profile so often and was so needy for them. I highly doubt they still feel that way. I can't stand the thought of them falling for someone else. On top of it all, my life has gone to shit recently and I need their support now more than ever. I know that sounds selfish but I really don't know what else to do. Talking to friends just isn't the same.",14

So a couple weeks ago i got a snap for a girl I'll call Olivia. Olivia tells me that shes a horrible friend for doing it but shes released on hydros but makes sure I know she wont do it again, so I'm like ok that's not like terrible I wont tell anyone about it. A week later she tells me shes been doing them for a week straight. This freaks me out of course and makes me really nervous and anxious so after 30 minutes I finally convinced her to tell her boyfriend well call him mark. But she didn't tell mark the truth she only told him that she was thinking about doing them. This makes mark very upset that she lied to him but not upset enough to not make the 2 hour drive to see her this weekend. Btw mark is one of my roomates. So mark breaks down after a night of us drinking and doesnt know what to do so my drunk ass gives him am amazing talk about it and what he should say and do coming forward. While hes drunk he tells me he's going to arrange a meeting with her dad while he is back so I'm like bam problem solved her parents will know about it. Next day I'm like did you tell her dad? Mark is like nah her dad is going to be in boone 2 hours away and I don't want to tell him over the phone. So I'm like drive to Boone and tell him cause the sooner the better. And hes like nah. So my other roomate john is back in Charlotte right now and I'm like you want john to tell her dad he says no, im like ill.be back in fort mill in a  week I'll tell him he says no. While all this is going on she is making posts about doing hydros and shit and its freaking me the fuck out like she is going to die. So I told him tonight that I'm going to tell her parents in two weeks if he doesnt tell them and then freaks out on me calls me an asshole says fuck you and is just livid at the thought of me telling her parents without his permission but I know for a fact he will not tell her parents anything about the drugs and alcohol abuse as well because he is too focused on not thinking about it to have a good plan on how to deal with her drug problem. So I think if nothing happens and it's only us that know she is either going to die or commit suicide and I couldnt live with myself knowing that it was preventable. So people of reddit should i finally get it over with and tell her parents or just remain neutral about to whole thing and not do anything at all.",1

And it's in there for another week. I just got home from the hospital and all I want to do is smoke. I would break it open but fuck it was like $70. not sure what to do. it was a very difficult day and decompression is my middle name right now. but my vape is in the fucking k safe. I'm not going to lie I set it to 10 days on a whim and literally just pressed it not thinking about it. but now it's stuck in there and I'm like why did I do that. I've been thinking about other ways I can get high but disty doesn't taste great and I don't think you would give me the high that I'm looking for anyway. I think it would just put me to sleep. I just want to be a vibin right now and just chill. I don't know what to do.

I don't know if this is the right sub to post in but I'm going to chance it. I'm not going to admit to myself that I have an addiction but I know that I most likely do deep down. I started getting high at work every single day and I probably lost my job in part because of this. I have a lot of shit going on right now and I felt and still feel like being high is easier that way. it makes things easier. but now that I've been sober for 3 days I'm very clear headed. but I'd rather not be so I don't have to think about all this shit. just reality comes right back crashing down on you right? I'm trying to at least control my consumption some. I know I probably have a problem. And I at least want to reign it in some.

any advice be really appreciated.",4

Everyday when I would come home from school I would smoke in order to forgot the shitty life I was living. I wasn‚Äôt smoking in groups of people like normal high school potheads, but instead I would do it by my self for the main purpose of forgetting about my horrible social life. The main reason I would do this is is because of my horrible anxiety I had while in school. I just got so paranoid being around other people in certain situations and instead of thinking about how I could fix myself I would instead get high. It got so rough that instead I was only happy when high off of marijuana. When high I just felt a sense of enjoyment, a feeling that I would not get while sober. 

Something that I want kids in that may see this post is to live high school like nobody is watching you or judging you, don‚Äôt get so wound up anxiety that you have no social life because of it. Also I suggest to not smoke marijuana by yourself because it can easily and quickly become a coping method for depression.",76

I spent the last  almost 5 years slowly beginning to lose my grasp on the progressive disease of addiction. I've been given an incredible gift, another chance to live life on life's terms. I got so, so close to rock bottom. Somehow I had just enough self-awareness to look at how much further I had to fall and recognize that this is the time to stop. 

I grew up LDS (Mormon), and I pushed away really hard. Organized religion is not for me, nor was any higher power for most of my life. I've wanted to stop for a long time, I've known that I had a problem. I tried NA and I had these roadblocks that I could identify, but couldn't get past. I got a sponsor, I really tried, but I couldn't stay clean for more than a week. Surrender was so difficult for me; I couldn't figure out how to accept there was a benevolent higher power. I gave up, I decided I could just be a better addict. 

It got worse, naturally. I overdosed, should've died. I got lucky. My mom had a hunch for some reason, cops came over to my apartment for a welfare check. I was still just barely coherent enough to let them in. I had almost an ounce of meth in separate bags, fentanyl, a scale, benzos, a bunch of thc carts. I wasn't selling, but it sure as hell looked like it. They didn't charge me because I was cooperative, took me to the ER. Ended up in the BHU, they assumed it was an attempted suicide. 

I don't think I'll ever forget the moment it finally all clicked for me. I was getting ready to start trying to manipulate the therapist there so I could get out ASAP and go back to what I was doing. But for some reason I decided to take a step back and just look at my life. I had been miserable for so long. This is one of 4 overdoses, 3 of which happened in the last year. I'm gonna fucking die. Do I really want to die? That's where I'm headed, I can only get lucky so many times. I had a scholarship to school, a girlfriend of 5 years, a nice apartment, a pretty good job. Lost it all. And I just finally surrendered. 

I still don't believe in God, but I can now flip the switch in my brain that denies the existence of a higher power. NA just started working for me. I spent the next week cleaning out my apartment, packing a single suitcase with clothes and I moved to another state. I'm going into a rehab facility in 10 days. I finally figured it out, and I'm so grateful to everyone that got me here. I wouldn't change a single fucking thing that happened. I get to draw on those experiences for the rest of my life. My parents, my girlfriend that enabled me, my using friends, hell my dealers; Thanks for the ride. It's time for a personality change.",5

He started saying how much he missed me so much and how perfect I was, how he doesn‚Äôt deserve me. This is like week 2-3. We end up hooking up about a month in. Now he‚Äôs always at my place since he‚Äôs ‚Äúlooking for a place‚Äù, I was okay with it since I enjoyed his company. Then week 3-4. He asked me for $120 and a long explanation on why. I figured he has taken me out a bunch already (weeks 1-2) so I sent it. He said he‚Äôll return the money tomorrow before work. 

He never did. 

I end up going on vacation for a week.  We text a bit but before I left he wrote multiple messages about how amazing I am (we don‚Äôt really know each other that well, so I was kinda like whatever, but responded flirty.) After I get back. He comes over we hang out, chill, have sex. He barely sleeps throughout the night. Was getting up multiple times throughout the night to go to the bathroom. I never heard him pee just the toilet flush (but maybe I just couldn‚Äôt hear it.) One night he got up about 15 times. Seriously. I was like how do you have any liquid in your body? (Side note. I have no clue about drugs.)

A few days later he sends me another text about needing $40. My dumbass sends it to him. No question.  Another week later he asks for another $40. This time I get pissed and go off on him. He never paid me from before and I‚Äôm so confused cuz he has a job (well that‚Äôs what he said.)  We end up hanging the next week. Long story short, i start feeling weird about all this and I look up his record online. Found out he has a felony and drug charges amongst other things (10 rows of stuff) - aggregated possession of drugs - treatment pending. Before we stopped talking he gave me a story about his mom being rushed to the hospital and needing emergency surgery. That‚Äôs why he stood me up. Later I found out she was fine on vacation in Mexico. I haven‚Äôt seen him since last week and he randomly stopped talking to me (thank god) but I‚Äôm so confused. I didn‚Äôt even get to ask him about anything. He got what he could out of me and now I‚Äôm like, wow. He got me. The sex was great that‚Äôs the only good thing about it. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for insight or if anyone has dealt with something like this. 

In hindsight there were more red flags that I ignored.",7

I decided to smoke a little bit of weed thinking it would be harmless about two months ago. Then without me noticing that I was falling back into my old habits, I smoked every night so I could feel better. I got back home after visiting my parents and smoked some weed with my partner. It triggered a five hour long episode of psychosis and PTSD flashbacks. It was excruciatingly terrifying. My entire body was shaking and I could hear millions of voices threatening me.

I‚Äôm fine now, and I haven‚Äôt smoked weed since. I‚Äôm just really upset at myself and guilty for relapsing.

I've also got covid and I think that's a trigger due to wanting to pop some benzos and chill in bed all day.

This is my first post into this group however I've been lurking about for sometime and taking a lot of good advice from other posts. I thought creating this post could help me with my recovery.

A little about me... 35 year old male relativity successful with regards to work running my own business, married last September and a one year old daughter which im very proud and happy about, on the face of it my life is great but i have a problem and  my problem is cocaine. I was first introduced to coke as a 17 year old and have taken it ever since not huge amounts but continuous use over that period. I have noticed in particular over the past 2/3 years things are starting to become out of control (or even more out of control). Previously a friday into Saturday would be my norm 1-3g depending what I had planned. Now it can be fri/sat/sun and midweek even during work. I seem to find any excuse to use ie. footballs on lets get a bag.... tested positive for Covid lets get a bag (no joke very shameful).

I have an association with alcohol and coke which I cant deny, right now to me they are one and the same if I drink I snort simple as that which means for the foreseeable future no alcohol. I am a little confused as to what my problem is... is both only the coke or is it alcohol? I have an understanding of being addicted to Alcohol as both my parents are recovering alcoholic's both been in recovery for over 28 years. I suppose in a way I'm ashamed that history is/has repeated itself and its something I was determined not to allow to happen. Due to this i haven't spoken to my parents on this subject as it feels completely shameful and i have let them down........ does anyone have any advice having this discussion with loved ones/parents?

&#x200B;

I have consider CA/NA but for some reasons haven't found the confidence to get to a meeting either in person or online. I suppose it makes everything 'real' and that scares me, to be honest I feel ashamed to have to admit to family and friends i have an addiction... hard to put into words if that makes sense.

&#x200B;

I am currently 19days without using cocaine and about 10 of alcohol which I'm delighted with, have spoken with my wife and have her support, going to the gym 4/5 times a week all of which is really helping me and keeping me focused, long term im hoping I can maintain this although I have an uneasy feeling about cravings and working through them.... esp out with friends whist drunk as coke is freely available and in abundance. Again any useful help or advice on this or anything else would be greatly received and much apricated.

&#x200B;

Till one day in 3rd grade we almost got caught..ended that kinda quick. So that meant the first time I saw it was at the age of 7. and ever since I couldn't stop thinking of it. It began a terrible cycle of awful intrusive thoughts everytime I sat down. (Just to clarify at this time of course I knew it was bad.) I remember looking up s-x stuff on youtube, or just looking up pretty woman. Till one day I looked it up on Google. Yep. Finally saw the wonderful orange and black. I was fascinated, I loved how I could see everything. Alot of watching I ended up finding some truly disturbing videos. Specifically ones trying to represent women (18+) as underage girls, at age 12 I felt the need to be submissive and I didn't understand that I could say no. You know how po-n can fu<k up a boy making him aggressive because that what he saw the male figure doing? Yeah I guess the female figure f'd me up. I was so obsessed with thinking this is what I should be like, I thought it was normal. Soon enough I ended up finding actual videos of victims. 2 girls in the corner of the basement bleeding, 2 men. I cried that day and realized my mindset wasn't normal. I started to feel delusional, my dreams were scaring me. And I couldn't tell if what I was thinking actually happened (I thought I was sa, and to remind you I still don't exactly know if I was or not) this addiction of male validation and s-x grew uncontrollably, I hurt myself multiple times knowing I knew what was going on with me wasn't right.

Any advice how I can express my care and love for him, while still explaining that being around him while he is actively using is extremely unhealthy for me?","He's been an addict on and off for many years. He is not my biological brother, but was raised with me as such, essentially. As a teenager, he moved in with my alcoholic mother and I during a period he was struggling with his use. My mom left  me with lots of PTSD always worrying about her ODing, and my brother did too (frequently nodding out in the bathroom to the point of being unresponsive, but not overdosed). My mom passed earlier this year, and Ive been on a long and difficult journey to work through my trauma from life since. My brother showed up unannounced three days ago at 2 am, homeless and needing a safe place. I took him in and have helped him get the basics (showered, fed, clean clothes). Its day three, and I was able to get him to go help my grandmother for money, and only now sitting alone do I feel the decompression and stress coming off. I felt like I was disassociated and in a trance while he was here; I trade stocks and crypto and I was making terrible choices and not using my proper trading tools I know I have, lost 30% in the three days from not managing my risk appropriately. A small example, but I feel that Im so occupied by trying to keep calm and use my DBT skills to avoid having a PTSD episode that I cannot function in the ways I need to do be both productive and content. I suffer from chronic depression among other issues, and building/taking part in a ""life worth living"" is essential to keep the worst of my symptoms at bay. Productivity is a large part of this for me.  


I love my brother so much, however, we both have had hard lives and Im still doing my best to get my stuff sorted out, alone, at 22. I have no family support outside of my grandmother, and she is not well off and helps with things like extra food and basic supplies if I cant manage due to bills. I missed a shift at work the next morning because i didn't know what kind of mindset he was in, and many people who know addicts also know addiction can drive people to make morally unaligned choices;  with a history of stealing, I couldnt risk having what little I have taken from me by him, let alone knowing the negative emotional impact it would have also had on him to betray me (hes a very caring person). I barely slept the past few days, always monitoring his breathing when hes nodding off on my couch. It's just too much for me at this moment to have him staying with me, although he made it clear he wasn't trying to move in, and that he just needed a place to stay for a moment (happy to house him, hate to know my family is struggling).  


I know I have to have the conversation with him addressing why he can't live here (out of respect for him, hes my family and deserves that understanding imo), but I feel like I need to have a conversation that lets him know that 1) I love him 2) I want to see him get help (all senses; not just addiction) 3) I want to see him do well 4) Im too young and going through too much of my own stuff to have the stress of seeing him daily in this condition, while he also needs my emotional and logical support figuring out how to navigate his situation.

Anything helps. Thanks ahead of time guys.",4

I always felt insecure because of people's attractive photos, always felt dissapointed because I'm not good at anything and don't have hobbies or can't do my own makeup. Always envious of people with lots of friends and family, envious of those who have big homes, go on holidays etc, and I was always envious at those who seemed to have happy, perfect lives with happy partners, happy families and friends and there lives seemed so positive and perfect.

Then as I matured and got older, I realised people only post the best parts online, some people even post complete lies, they present their lives as being one way, when they're the complete opposite and I realised that the internet was just full of lies and smoke and mirrors.

Since my mental health has been so bad over the last couple of years and I've not been getting out the house and more and more, I've been wanting to start blogging/vlogging but not sure what I want my content to be, and then it dawned on me today... I want to start blogging/vlogging the reality of my life, being honest, open and raw about everything.

I want to start an Instagram, Tumblr, TikTok and/or YouTube channel and post constantly about what's going on in my life as well as showing what life is like while having an addiction.

I wanna post about how I've spent a week in bed and haven't had a shower or changed my clothes, post pictures on days when I look like crap rather than only posting pictures where I look good, I wanna make posts from when my other personalities are in control (I have DID/split personality), I wanna post about my feelings etc, and I want to do this because I think it's important and positive for people to see the reality of people's lives so that they don't feel alone, so that they realise there are others out there just like them and that their lives ARE normal, and that they are not failures or dissapointments ... I feel it could really benefit people and people can relate to me...Yes, my mental health is a big cause of the things that happen in my life and how I feel sometimes, but my addiction affects my lifestyle and the way I live as well and I would include how my addiction affects me within all of this too. I would like to document/make videos of myself experiencing withdrawals, post when I'm high, post about my experiences with my addictions, give advice in regards to addiction etc etc 

I want to know what sort of content you guys would like to see, if at all.

I'm going to write as well as do pictures and videos. What sort of things would you guys like to read/see?

I'm thinking of posting natural pictures of myself on days I feel like crap, where I have no make up on, haven't done my hair, not got nice clothes on etc. Pictures like I've just woken up from bed or pictures showing how I've spent my day and how I've looked all day, rather than going and putting on make up, dressing up nice and posing for a set of photos, I want to show the reality of how I really look during the day 

Videos about how my week has been and what I've done, even if I've been in bed all week

Videos and text posts when I'm suffering with psycotic episodes or when my other personalities/identities are in control

Pictures/videos of how my flat looks when I've not tidied up, or showing where I live and how I don't have a lot of stuff because I don't have a lot of money

These are just a few ideas, I'd love to hear your ideas too of what you'd like to see!",4

4 years of daily use, apparent spiritual awakenings, demons and angels, speaking to the universe etc and I end back here - 10x worse than I was a year ago. I'm on the verge of, if not already fully schizophrenic and my life is crumbling around me on a daily basis.

I've tried meetings, counselling, private therapy and can't afford rehab as I run my own company and also sub-contract as an sales director for another huge company.

I have all the potential to be stupidly rich beyond my wildest dreams but this addiction keeps holding me back at every single point and my employers as well as friends and family are beginning to notice.

What can I do?

I'm at the 2/3 gram a day point that barely does anything apart from numb the never-ending anxiety caused by the craving, under investigation by the police for related crime and the worst part is that I'm still fairly successful in terms of my career and company.

My company is built all around helping your average Joe online who doesn't have time or the patience to build websites and I even donate 5% of all my proceeds to charity as well as giving local area discount.

It feels like all these small stabs I make at trying to do better in the world will have some sort of repercussive effect on me in terms of help but I'm beginning to understand that I can only help myself and there's no magic moment that's going to fix things.

Any advice?",9

Can someone help me get a better understanding of things?,"I'm 28 years old and I've been doing Cocaine for the last 3.5 years. I just have some questions that I can't seem to find any answers to online. I want to mention that I've never used cocaine sober, not even once. Only when drunk. However it's come to the point where as soon as I drink a couple of beers with friends I start thinking about it, so yea I would say that I'm addicted. On average I've been drinking once a week for the past years and therefore I've used cocaine once a week as well. Usually around 0.2 - 0.5g per night. 

I've always been a very energetic person with a positive view of life and nowadays I feel like a shadow to my former self. Before I started using cocaine I had a great sex life but nowadays my priority is cocaine when I become drunk and not girls anymore. I just haven't been happy for the last years and I've begun to realize more and more that cocaine might be the biggest factor in that. I always feel like shit a couple of days after I do it and I'm just not the same person anymore. The whole covid lockdown situation has affected me big time as well I guess. 

Anyways I don't intend to write an essay even though there are much more things I could say to make you even more aware of my situation. The last time I used cocaine was on New Year's eve this year, so about a month ago. 

These are my questions:

1: I know that the dopamine receptors are affected by cocaine use and I'm just wondering if they will ever be restored or if they are fucked for the rest of my life? In case they can be restored how long would that take?

2: Is doing cocaine on average once a week 0.2 - 0.5g when drunk classified as a heavy addiction to coke?

3: Nowadays it feels like I have memory problems and that everything just blurs together. This could also be because of many other factors such as the lockdown etc but will my memory improve again?

4: I only get cravings when I'm drunk, I never even think about coke when sober. Since I quit a month ago I've been drinking once and managed to get through the night without doing it and it was hard for a few moments since my friends were using. How many nights of going out drinking do you think I have to ""endure"" before my cravings start to cease? I'm well aware that we could be talking many, many nights.

5: Is there anything I can do to help my mind and body heal? I've started to exercise, taking Vitamin D supplements since I live in the north, and planning on starting to meditate. Is there anything else I can do?

I am planning on doing a video series on happiness. In one of these videos, I want to talk about addiction and I want to clarify what nuances and kinds of addiction there are. Hence I thought it might be interesting to interview some people who are/who were addicted. 

The way how the interview would go is up to you; via text (then I would look for someone who reads it out loud), via video call (you can still change your voice or use some sort of filter), or via phone call (same here). 

Here are the questions I plan to ask:

1. What are you addicted to?
2. Why? 
3. Does it make you happier? 
4. Do you see any meaning in fighting that addiction even though it will be hard and it may decrease your happiness for some time? What is this meaning? What gives you this strength?
5. When did you realize that you are addicted?
6. Can you be happy when your addiction is not satisfied? (for example you are addicted to alcohol but you can't drink at the moment)
7. Can you describe the happiness that you experience while on a ""high""?
8. Can addiction be good for you? When?
9. Is there anything more you'd like to add?

You can also just answer the questions in the comment section, I am really interested in learning your point of view. And before I use anything said for the video, I will always ask first, so you are free to share your experiences without having to fear that it will be propagated by me.

I‚Äôm a multiple substance user. I wouldn‚Äôt have necessarily said ‚Äòaddict‚Äô until the last month‚Ä¶ and who wants to use that nasty word until their ready to look their demons in the eye‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve always had problems with overconsumption but would be able to go a month or so without anything.

And then I got pressured to start using other stuff recreationally and now use that and Booze as coping mechanisms.  Did I forget to say that I have GAD and high functioning anxiety? Oh and left a relationship with a 23 year closet addict and narcissist.

So. Some life changes have caused me to spiral. Namely Mr. Narcissist came back in claiming he ‚Äòchanged‚Äô and was clean. He was not- and I found out a slew of other gut wrenching revelation.  And COVID style Christmas- I think that‚Äôs enough to make anyone spiral.

And although compared to most- I‚Äôm not ‚Äòthat‚Äô bad.  But. I‚Äôm a fulltime single mom who works 16 hour days as a business owner.  So: my productivity is falling, and I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs $20 or $1000- I‚Äôm taking food out of my children‚Äôs mouths and clothing off their backs.

No. I haven‚Äôt been to AA- well I was as support for another person a few years ago- or NA. I‚Äôve had a weekly invite to NARC-ANON for the last 1.5 years but have only logged in twice.

Hello everyone, Sadly posting the same story I did 2 years or so ago when I first beat benzo addiction. 
To preface, The first time I successfully quit, I had been through a bunch of different RC bzds's, and ultimately ended with alprazolam 1mg which I jumped off CT due to court ordered drug test, And was successful and clean for 6 months, With the wd's being bad but ultimately i got through them and was still working at the job i had at the time on day 3, It was doable.
Ofcourse, my fucking dumbass got readdicted to the chems once I got off probo, a single ""im off dose"" Turned right back into the addiction I had before, and now fast forward to today, i am back in the same spot. 


My dosage currently where I can be comfortable throughout the day is 1.5mg flubromazepam, Emphasis on the PAM, i do NOT mean flub. I know this dose is low but im assuming due to my first round with this shit is why my wd's seem to get much worse then when I jumped off xanax, I tried completely stopping already and only lasted a day with shakes getting quite violent. It's been a multi year battle of this for me where I've only taken them for maintenance 90% of the time, taking the least amount i need to just feel normal. The other 10% of the time, If even that much I would seek out recreational effects, Which it has been awhile since doing so, with my stash dwindling for awhile now inspiring me to taper down fast and low to now.


Im so goddamn fucking tired of this. I have two degrees, Recently graduating with my dream degree, and I obviously feel like I cannot do anything until getting clean due to Pre-employement DT's, and in general going through this cycle. I also want to emphasize that I have kept my dependence/addiction completely to myself this whole time other then the therapist I worked with in court (Was in trouble due to alcohol, But DT's were included hence them finding the benzos in my system), and a seperate therapist who I saw independently. Other then that, I have never revealed to anyone in my life what I'm going through even when going through my CT withdrawals while living with my ex gf. Now i'm at the point where Im ready to tell my mom (who I still live with, again recently graduating), Who i'm hoping will be somewhat understandable as she is a recovering alcoholic, and works in the medical field. My dad was recently diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and I feel absolutely fucking terrible having him find out about this right now, He is not the understanding type about this stuff either. My now current girlfriend is one of the most amazing human beings Ive known, and im also terrified to now lose her.


I need guidance on what to do about getting on a doctor supervised taper. I am terrified of getting sent to inpatient when I know I can function as a human being in soceity as I have for the past couple years while tapering them down repeatedly. I know with a doctors help that taper would actually end instead of getting to a low dose and maintaining there. I dont know how that all works and what is stopping me is going to the doctor for help, and getting sent to inpatient involuntary, and my whole life crashing around me with my whole family finding out as well as friends and girlfriend and yea im sure that part makes sense. Im looking for any advice on how to go about this with the doctor, And even if it seems silly if anyone has any advice on how to go about telling this all to my mother.


I should highlight the fact I have 3-4 days left of fpam to take, 3-4 as im sure i could lower my dose even more to stretch out my supply, but this is why this is like a ""coming to jesus"" moment where I'm ready to get doctors supervision and tell atleast one family member. Ive stayed away from ordering more as I cant take this anymore and want the cycle to end more then anything, Truly. Any help is appreciated. If you've read this far then thank you.",1

2022-01-25 11:45:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/sci0ae/find_courage_to_break_addiction/,Find courage to break addiction," 

Good morning everyone,

I hope everybody is doing ok with everything that is happening lately. Today I wanted to do a post about courage and how much it is needed when you embark on your journey to defeat addiction.

Courage is this special ability that you have within yourself to fight for something that you value above everything else in this world. Courage is what you see in the movies you watch, the books you read or the video games you play when the hero defeats the vilain at the end.

Every aspect of your life is designed for you to find your true path. Every good or sad events that ever occurred in your life and the way you dealt with these situations should tell you a little bit more about yourself and what you stand for.

Now, I want you to think about what addiction does to you. Everyday you wake up focusing all your mind, body and energy on finding the substance of your choice. You become selfish. You value the way this substance is gonna make you feel above everything else. Above your family, your girlfriend, your friends, your pets and in the end above life itself.

Slowly, everything that you cared for and that you deemed worth fighting for is vanishing before your very eyes. The music you once loved is just sound in your ears (No more meaning to it). The food you once loved tastes blend and you don't see the point to eat well anymore until you just stop to eat. Doing activities you liked now feels like a chore as well as spending time with family and friends. You isolate yourself and descend even deeper into darkness.

You start to get lazy and unmotivated. You may even lose your job. You feel like everything you touch is turning into a disaster. At one point you may even realize what is happening, but you'll be too scared to do anything about it.

When this happen you'll have two options:

1-Get even deeper in addiction because you can't face this world you have created.

2-Find Courage.

For someone who has nothing left, option one will seem like the obvious answer. After all, there's no such thing as a hero without a cause right ? These people might say things like:

\-We're all gonna die anyway so what's the point ?

\-My case is hopeless nobody cares about me anyway.

They will come up with any excuses possible.

Or, they might consider Suboxone or methaodone ( I'll do a post about these later).

But very few people will choose option two. Why is that ? What is it about addiction that prevent people from digging inside of them to find courage and what is worth fighting for ? Why does addiction has the power to numb your senses t'il you can't see the beauty of life anymore ? Why does addiction steal your dreams, your joy....your love ? These are all questions you will need to ask yourself on your journey to sobriety.

You will need some sober time in order to answer these questions. You will face hard truth about yourself but you will also learn a lot.

If you choose courage over the easy way out you'll be rewarded beyond your wildest dreams.

You will be REBORN.

If you are in pain right now, if you are suffering or if you feel like giving up....DON'T !!! TRUST ME !!

Here‚Äôs how.,"If you‚Äôre new in recovery, welcome. I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre here. I consider myself in early recovery too to be perfectly honest. I say that not to discourage you, but to remind you this is a lifelong journey, and with a clean a sober healthy lifestyle, there‚Äôs no reason we can‚Äôt all live a long time. 

If you‚Äôre in the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how to quit, it‚Äôs so hard. I keep going back‚Äù stage, just know this is not to shame you in any way or discourage you, but to let you know what my experience is and hopefully it helps someone else. 

When I was 18 years old an odd friendship I had in high school with someone that saw me as that weird dude that hangs out with Christian rock band kids and someone I saw as someone with parents that weren‚Äôt strict like mine turned into an adult friendship and I was quickly introduced to my worst best friend for the next 15 years alcohol. My disease got worse over the years, turned into a cocaine habit followed by a binge on various psychedelics, one of which (psilocybin) had the accidental effect of temporarily shutting off my addictive desire for alcohol and coke and everything else for that matter. I experienced a strange sense of peace for the first time in my adult life for a short time, but I didn‚Äôt do anything to look at the underlying issues, I didn‚Äôt stop going to the same bars, or hanging out with the same people, and I did not change my life in any way except not drinking. So, obviously when the mushroom effects wore off, I immediately gave in to my first craving and was back where I was alcoholic wise within a week as if I had never put it down. I got fired from my job, kicked out of my apartment again and found myself homeless for the 2nd time in 2 years.i went on like this for a couple of months before realizing that after tasting sober life, I wanted it for real this time. I called an inpatient facility in a completely different city, I left my drinking friends behind for good, and most importantly,

I was willing to do whatever it took to get and stay clean from all addictive substances. 

No matter what that meant, no matter how hard it was, no matter how much I had to change my life Or what amount of work I needed to put into it or how vulnerable or uncomfortable aspects of recovery made me, I knew I had to dive in 100% willing and ready to work. Because that‚Äôs what it takes. There is no silver bullet. No one thing that will keep you sober. It‚Äôs a dedication and a drive to doing everything in your power to stay clean and make a better life than you had when you were getting high/drunk. That‚Äôs all.",9

If you guys could help me in any way, I‚Äôd appreciate it so much. Here‚Äôs some context. 

For many years my brother has struggled on and off with addiction. Whether that be pills, weed, cocaine and basically every drug there is. Some I have never heard of. For the past 4 months he cleaned up his act, got clean, went to work again and the gym. He moved in with me to get away from our toxic father who we no longer speak to. He was doing very well but with covid and more lockdowns coming back he relapsed very recently. I lightly tried to confront him about it as it‚Äôs quite obvious when he‚Äôs using. He eventually tearfully admitted to me he relapsed and we had a heart to heart conversation about it. When he uses he won‚Äôt talk to me as much, avoid me even. He disappears for long periods and irregular times of the day/night. And with a lot of the drugs he takes- especially cocaine, he can get very aggressive. It scares me. 

I thought after our conversation about his relapse things may start to look up. They‚Äôve only gotten worse. He‚Äôs gone back to self isolation, disappearing and tonight he was set off by a very small thing and screamed at me. 

It hurts me so much to see him like this. When he‚Äôs on drugs, he becomes someone I don‚Äôt recognize and now I feel afraid to come talk to him about anything with how aggressive he can get.

So I‚Äôm asking you guys. What else can I do? Should I keep trying to talk to him? Should I give him space right now? I know he can only really get clean by himself but I need to know I am doing everything in my power to help him.

I‚Äôm sorry for the long essay. I‚Äôm losing my mind with the thought of losing him, he‚Äôs the most important person in the world to me. Thank you for your time.",1

Wanted to share my latest podcast episode on [Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT).](https://sandstonecarepodcast.buzzsprout.com/1800130/9921183-what-is-dialectical-behavioral-therapy-or-dbt-with-natana-reason) We discussed how DBT is like the Batman utility belt of therapies but instead of gadgets, you collect coping skills. And since much of mental health disorders, substance use, and addiction come down to how we cope with stress and trauma, it's a therapy that is about as practical as it gets, and it's designed to be used in everyday life. A lot of great insights that may help someone!

I hope everyone the best on their recovery journey, stay strong, and remember that you are not alone‚ù§Ô∏è",2

We have been together 2.5yrs. We live together with his two kids who he has half time. When we met my bf was recently out of a long term relationship, and I knew he was struggling with depression. We took it slow. He was upfront about substance abuse issues he had in his past. My understanding was his use of hard drugs (cocaine, benzos, opioids) was in the past. I knew he drank alcohol heavily, but over our first year or so together he moderated his drinking, phasing out liquor and sticking to a few a few beers a night. It seemed like he was working on himself and making positive changes. We moved in together around the 1yr mark. 

Since we moved in together I have occasionally noticed some odd behavior. Nothing extreme, but constricted pupils, lethargy, difficulty maintaining an erection. And I mostly chalked them up to stress since my bf has a full time job, takes care of his kids etc. But the last six months I have become increasingly suspicious. My bf had some financial issues (nothing catastrophic, but smallish amounts of money missing, short on rent that sort of thing), I noticed the constricted pupils more frequently... I grew up around addiction and I just had that feeling something was off. I know people struggling with addiction can be high functioning, and it got harder for me to ignore the things I was seeing.

So I snooped through an old cell phone (I know, I'm embarassed). I found out he was using heavily when we first met and had been struggling since to slow and stop his use. But also saw that he had been in regular contact with his dealer up until the present. I have since looked over our shared cell phone bill and see they regularly communicate despite my bf saying they are no longer friends. This weekend I noticed the signs I associate with potential use, saw he been texting his dealer, and asked my bf if there was anything, anything at all, going on with him. Anything I didn't know about. I did not get specific, and he denied anything was going on. This morning I looked in his pants pocket and found a baggie with a hollowed out pen and some white residue. 

I love my bf. He is a kind, gentle person. He takes care with my feelings. I truly thought we were honest with each other. I can't get my mind around the fact that he hid this from me. He knows I grew up around drugs and addiction, and lost a parent to an overdose. The most generous interpretation I have is he didn't want to scare me off. I also know his use stems from his traumatic childhood (he experienced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse). And he might have been too deeply ashamed to tell me. 

But all that being said I still don't know what to do. My bf is high functioning, and if I didn't grow up around drugs I may not have noticed. I do feel intense guilt for snooping, but also don't regret it. I felt like I was projecting my own trauma with substance abuse onto him, but it's clear now I'm not. 

I know we need to talk about it...but what is the best way to start that conversation? What boundaries should I be prepared to draw? Should I consider leaving? This seems to be the common advice, but it would be so hard for me. I believe he is a wonderful person who struggles to cope. Should I ask that he get treatment? My fear is things will spiral for him. He has some level of control now, but we that always be the case? And I just don't know if I can get past the dishonesty. That is what hurts the most. I worry I will always feel like is lying to me. 

Sorry if this isn't the best forum for this, but I've seen a really negative attitude towards people with addiction in relationship subreddits. I hope anyone here will have a more empathetic view.",3

I fucked it up. I figured I would be fine just using the one time. FIRST MISTAKE. Now 6 months later it's been back to my daily use. I need it again to feel normal.

This all started on a fateful night with my ex. I went through a period after we broke up where I had problems with drugs but I thought it was just an emotional response to the pain in conjunction with a lot of family problems at the time. 

I‚Äôve since quit drugs, aside from alcohol, and I joined the Marines. It‚Äôs been about 2 years since my enlistment and I thought I was in a much better spot. Sure everyone knows marines drink a lot, but I kept my house in order for the most part. I never came to work drunk, I became a team leader and I got into much better physical shape. Sure I black out more than I would like to admit, but here it feels like it‚Äôs common and often celebrated. 

Fast forward to my annual Christmas vacation, or as we call it a leave block. I sent a text to her asking if she would like to grab a drink and she obliged. We had a great time, one of the best conversations I‚Äôve had in years. I went to visit one of my buddies for New Years and after coming back we went on another date. This time to lunch. Again, it went so well and we had amazing conversation. 

We had one final night planned where we went to the Van Gogh immersion experience, and after we went to grab some drinks. Now, I hadn‚Äôt eaten all day and I can usually handle my liquor well, but this time I didn‚Äôt. I remember laughing and having a good time, then all I remember is her saying I‚Äôm not letting you drive home. She took me to my friends house and I woke up very confused and ashamed. I tried to call later that day but she didn‚Äôt answer, so I sent an apology for my blackout. 

I haven‚Äôt heard from her since and I feel terrible. I feel like I‚Äôve just wasted the years I had in recovery continuously lying to those around me and most importantly myself that I‚Äôve changed and in all reality I feel like this whole facade I created came crashing down on me that night.  I feel empty since then, and I haven‚Äôt drank but I keep having nightmares about that night just in different settings. I don‚Äôt know what to do, because I love this woman, but I guess I didn‚Äôt love her enough to show her the respect she deserved. Fuck",2
2022-01-23 19:17:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/sb87xl/question/,Question,Hey everyone. So I‚Äôm about a little over two years clean from pain killers and benzos. After 5 months off them I had felt like I was back to normal. I knew both those pills messed with my brain chemistry to where I‚Äôd always feel like I was depressed and not normal. For about a year and a half off everything I finally felt like I was kind of back to normal. I had added kratom back in September to take at work and would have a few beers an some weed just on saturdays maybe twice a month. I kind of feel like I‚Äôm falling back into feeling depressed like I did when I was on the opiods and benzos. I can‚Äôt help but think me adding kratom an drinking twice a month has something to do with it . The kratom is a small dose like 2 mg Monday - Friday once a day before work. And I don‚Äôt drink much when I do on a Saturday. Did anyone get a year or two sober and feeling good then maybe tried to add drinking once in awhile and then started feeling off again? I know I probably should just stop the kratom for sure. My job is what got me hooked on pain killers and I‚Äôm still at the same job an now I‚Äôm taking kratom so maybe I need to find something else that isn‚Äôt such a reminder of the bad years.,2

2022-01-23 11:49:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/saxuoj/what_are_pain_pills_like/,What are pain pills like?,"I remember before I tried pain pills, I asked people what it was like. They said ‚Äúit‚Äôs like a burst of energy, yet the most comfortable relaxation, 
It‚Äôs like the most focused your mind can be, while still being completely calm all at the same time. 
It‚Äôs like the best feeling ever.‚Äù

And they were right.

But now if someone were to ever ask me what it‚Äôs like, I would tell them..

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like spending every single penny you ever had, on drugs.

It‚Äôs like going days without eating even though you were starving because you needed those pills more.

It‚Äôs like having to lie to every family member and every friend you‚Äôve ever had‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs like Having to lie to yourself because you can‚Äôt face who, and what, you truly are.

It‚Äôs like waking up DESPISING yourself from the shame and guilt, but still ready to drop everything to go get another pill.

It‚Äôs like going into withdrawals every 8 hours unless you had more pills to snort, smoke, or swallow. (And you usually didn‚Äôt)

It‚Äôs like never attending any family event because you were withdrawing too bad to pull yourself out of the bed.

It‚Äôs like having everyone that matters to you  stop inviting you to events, And eventually stop talking to you altogether.

It's like crying yourself to sleep every single night because you‚Äôre stuck in a cycle that you just can‚Äôt break out of. 

It‚Äôs like knowing you have one more chance to get better before your parents close the door on your relationship. For good this time.

It's like watching everyone around you succeed and yet you‚Äôre crumbling.

It‚Äôs like everything is on your drug dealer‚Äôs time. If they said five hours, You‚Äôll wait five hours in a car, vomiting into a fast food bag every 5 minutes while staring a hole in your phone just PRAYING it rings. And sometimes it never did.

It‚Äôs like stealing anything and everything worth value for those fucking pills. No matter how sentimental it was to you, or someone else.

It‚Äôs like losing so much weight you can‚Äôt even pretend to be healthy anymore. Everyone knows what you are now.

It‚Äôs like losing everything you‚Äôve ever owned in your entire life. Willingly. To get high for a couple of hours.

It‚Äôs like nobody believing a word you say. even if it‚Äôs the truth.

It‚Äôs like being a prisoner inside your own head.

It‚Äôs like contemplating suicide, every single day.

It‚Äôs like never being scared to die, because that would make it stop.

It‚Äôs like secretly hoping that this will be the pill that‚Äôs laced with something deadly, so this shit can finally be over with.

It‚Äôs like trying to shut your brain up for just a little bit. Literally going to the ends of the earth to make it all stop for just a few minutes.

It‚Äôs like seeing your family cry for you to stop. Scream and beg and plea right to your face, only for you to leave and go get high. Because stopping isn‚Äôt an option. It isn‚Äôt physically possible.

It‚Äôs like you‚Äôd do absolutely anything for more. And you did.

It‚Äôs like everyone hating you no matter where you went, because they knew you were a drug addict.

It‚Äôs like overdosing and going to get high right after.

It‚Äôs like getting robbed and going to get high after.

It‚Äôs like getting pulled over with pain pills in your sock and SOMEHOW by the grace of God, getting away with it and avoiding prison.. and going to get high right after.

It‚Äôs like walking into rehab 100 pounds with the clothes on your back and being scared to death.

It‚Äôs like giving your ENTIRE LIFE AWAY.
So if you‚Äôre ever curious like I was, please at least know the truth. 

It feels good for an hour. I won‚Äôt deny it. But I promise you. The hours that follow..

The days, the weeks, months‚Ä¶ years that follow..

Those don‚Äôt feel so good. Those are the lowest, most humbling, crippling, life-altering, relationship-obliterating, trust-shattering, self worth sabotaging, coldest, loneliest times you could ever possibly experience.

Take it from someone who‚Äôs been through it, and miraculously lived to tell the tale..

It‚Äôs not fucking worth it.‚Äù

Sincerely,
       A RECOVERED addict.",77

&#x200B;

I could have posted on facebook for the notification porn, but I would rather share it with people who need it. Heroin was my poison, but no matter what yours is, it is possible to recover.

&#x200B;

I was only deep in it for about three years, but it was enough to wreck me. I don't know how quickly it accelerates for most people but I chose the wrong friends and I got caught up in their neverending quest to be a badass. I guess I had a little spark of that in me as well. We watched movies like trainspotting and requiem for a dream and because we were little idiots that only made us want to try it more. I only smoked it a few times before we both took the plunge, and then it had us by the balls. A month or two into IV use I decided to quit, realizing what I was getting myself into, and that was the first time I ever kicked it cold turkey. I knew that my eldest brother had also suffered from a heroin addiction, but regardless of that he was my hero; a true badass - and I knew he would be proud of me for beating it, and it's something we could share. A punk rocking tattoo artist badass, he was the skin-raider, the ink-slinger, and an all around nice guy. I was just about over the worst of it, somehow managing to keep my shitty restaurant job, and ten days in I was starting to feel a little bit better. The next shift I worked, I came up front after dropping a load of dishes off to the back of the house, when the hostess girls assaulted me with tears and hugs. The last thing I remember was my friend Rachel telling me she loved me, and then I looked up and saw my aunt sobbing in the restaraunt lobby. My eldest brother had died. I later found out it was murder, but regardless, a large piece of me died with him. And I crawled right back into a spoon because I knew it was the only thing that could make me numb enough to sleep through the pain of life. That was two weeks before my senior year of high school. I spent my entire senior year as an addict, going home at lunch to get a small fix so I wouldn't start getting sick, then spending the rest of the day panicking trying to figure out how to get more money to get more dope. Covering up tracks, trying not to nod off in public or in school, using every penny of lunch money and every penny I could scrounge to get more, and I successfully fooled my family into thinking that it was the grief eating me; and this became my holding pattern for years.

&#x200B;

I don't have using dreams anymore, and I am grateful for that. It has been over a decade since I had a needle in my arm, and I am grateful for that. And this week I became a PhD candidate in physics, and I am proud as fuck for that.

&#x200B;

I am no pollyanna, but I just wanted to say that it is possible. I know I didn't believe people when they were saying it to me, so I'm sure other people won't believe it when I say it to them - but it is so much better not to have the daily panic attack. It is so much better not to have to slip into withdrawals every few hours if I didn't get my balloons. No more nodding off and messing up my spine. No more stealing. No more conniving. No more hurting in places where you don't even have places.

&#x200B;

I've been there. I get it. I love you all, and I hope you can save yourselves from the depths.

It isn't easy, but it is possible.

If i wasnt doing it id be thinking about it and how to get it asap and it was destroying me in a lot of spheres. Physically, psychologically, spiritually . I wish i could say im over it but the sample size of being without it isnt too big. However, if my words can help someone get 1 week off whatever the fuck their hooked on itll be worth the post.

Im gonna enumerate some points.

1. You gotta commit to not using (i know the voice in the back is real but you gotta get the intention out loud if you have to and be incisive about the decision

2. You might have to hit rock bottom in order to get to the point you really decide to change. IT MIGHT BUT IT DOESNT HAVE TO.

3. Write it down. All the feelings and things this substance does to you. All the pros and cons. You will see there are no pros. How its just fucking up your life in exchange of nothing. 15 minutes of euphoria that you can get doing anything pleasurable which takes me to number 4.

4. Change your habits. Triggers can get you falling right back into it, so change habits and know why you are doing so. Go for a run, drink a lot of water, take a shower, read a book, go to work, start a project. Occupy your mind.

5. The first days are the most difficult. It gets easier, the bad withdrawals get softer.

6. Remember why you are changing your life. Cuz yoy love yourself man! You dont deserve having ur life, friens, family, jobs being taken away from you over this shit. Remember the ppl who make it dont give a fuck about you!!! If youre dead or alive dont mean shit to them. I guess ur better alive tho, living like a zombie and consuming their substance getting addicted more and more.

7. Practice a connection with the divine. Im serious !!! Whether its yoga, shamanism, catcholicism, evangelism. Doesnt matter! Have faith in something. Find yourself. Purify your house. Clean it up. Clean yourself up. Breathe the air. Love yourself. 

8. Write down everyday what you are grateful for. Seriously, do it!!! Your family? Your dog? Friends? Write it down. Be grateful. Open your heart. Wish the best for yourself. YOU CAN DO IT. I CAN DO IT. WE CAN DO IT. 

I wish everyone power of will, strength and determination. It may not look or feel like it but we're in this together. A lot of ppl have conquered it, and we can do it. Live a better life. Enjoy the simple things and most importantly FEEL INNER PEACE. These are my opinions tho!!! I dont want anyone to think im trying to shove my truth in anyones face. I hope it helps. GOD LOVES YOU!!!!",14

If anyone could leave recommendations on more, that would be great! 

Undoing Drugs - Maia Szalavitz

I can‚Äôt even praise this book enough on how insightful it is about harm reduction. It covers the history of harm reduction (1970‚Äôs-Present) and all the corruption, stigma, pain and suffering that happened in between. It highlights major players in the harm reduction scene and the historical moments that brought us closer to a better future for addicts. It highlights the major issues still present, and provides examples of other options in harm reduction that have been used worldwide. 

Biology of Desire - Marc Lewis

Discusses in depth why addiction is not a disease. He argues the disease model is more harmful than good, and provides insight into the flaws as he explains the stories of 5 individuals suffering from a variety of addictions. He raises issues with the medicalised model of recovery, harm reduction and the negative effects it can have on recovering addicts. 

Memoirs of an addicted brain - Marc Lewis 

In this book, mark outlines his personal history with drugs. From his early teenage years to his rock bottom addicted to heroin. Marc is now a neuroscientist, and breaks down each substance and the biological and psychological effects it has on a person. It provides insight into his personal experience, as well as a lot of great information about the harms and effects of each substance.",5

I'm quite concerned cause we're having a baby in a couple of weeks and I do not wish to expose my child to this. 

I don't wanna seem like I'm attacking him with this and also don't want him to feel embarssed or be ashame. I used to have addictions to and eventually got help for it but he's pretty hard headed as a person and I sure know he will refuse to admit it. 

It has come to a point where he will go to the bathroom to watch it. I've talked about him about him watching porn and how it made me uncomfortable for him to look at other women he agreed to not do so anymore. We have a pretty good sex life but I sense that it isn't fulfilled enough for him. Obviously I don't wanna have sex everyday since I'm 30 weeks pregnant and it could out me into labor and it's sometimes uncomfortable physically.

Have had a lot on my mind lately and how my anxiety lead me to alcohol. I was in a terrible relationship for a year full of trust issues and being controlled by this persons anger. When they weren‚Äôt angry they were busy making me feel guilty about every single thing I did. Long story short. Tried breaking up with them dozens of times only to stay because they would threaten to kill them selves if I left them. I turned to alcohol shortly after that because I felt trapped. I didn‚Äôt feel like I had a way out. I was constantly anxious because of this relationship and ultimately I stayed drunk for the most part of 2020. Every single day I would start drinking at 8am until I went to sleep just so I could deal with the stress of it. I did terrible things that put others at risk as well. I lost myself in alcohol. It would numb everything for awhile. But I ultimately knew I had a problem and I needed help. It became so bad that I would have the shakes if I didn‚Äôt have a drink. I would throw up if I didn‚Äôt have a drink. I would feel restless and it just made my anxiety even worse when I wasn‚Äôt drunk. I eventually came clean to my whole family which was very hard to do but they were the best support system I could have ever asked for. I knew that if I didn‚Äôt get some kind of help that I wouldn‚Äôt be here much longer. I left that toxic relationship behind a year ago this month. I still have a drink every now and then while out with friends. Once every month now. but I finally have control over my life again and I‚Äôve never been happier. You don‚Äôt need alcohol to get through the day. You are good enough and strong enough to take back your life.

He looked down at his hands. They seemed smaller, somehow. Less dexterous. How long had it been since they‚Äôd done something useful? How long had he been *here*? 

This wasn‚Äôt a good time for an existential crisis. He‚Äôd been on the run for months. And as he looked up, he saw it. Or rather, he heard it, and then he saw it. A whir and a distant glimmer, only visible because it was an uncommonly clear night. One hundred, maybe two hundred meters. They‚Äôd found him. Again.

Oh god they‚Äôre close now. Should I pray? Or would that be a foxhole prayer? I thought as I layed down and prayed. A few minutes which seemed like an eternity had passed and they were gone.

*I uhhh. Hey, can I make a quick call? I assume I‚Äôll be needing a lawyer.‚Äù

I open my hand, revealing an old clamshell phone. I push the call button. It begins to ring.

‚ÄúSir, hand that over. You‚Äôre under arrest - you can make all the calls you want from lock-up. And hang it up first.‚Äù

*As you wish, officer.*

I end the call, which sends a signal to the the shaped charges that I had carefully disguised as excrement. The cars are blown to shreds, all five are infernos of smoke and ash and beautiful blue wisps of flame. 

The oldest trick in the book. Shaped shit charges. 

I watch the cunningly disguised hybrids succumb to the smoke. I feel no pity as I harvest blood and tissue samples from them.

I really hope this doesn't come off as insensitive or rude on this forum but I'm struggling to find support groups to help my situation.
I have a partner of 7 years who the whole time we have been together has struggled with addiction. He's been addicted to ice, cigarettes, alcohol, psycadelics, and weed.
He is currently beating himself up for letting the weed take hold of him rather than him being in control. He wants to get on top of it but everytime he sets an end of it, being his last 50 or q or whatever he will finish it and go get more. 
He always makes up excuses as to why he needs to get it when all I say is when you're ready you'll know. Do it in your own time. I know despite my words he can see the disappointment in my face. 
I try so hard to hide it but he knows it gets to me and it's wearing him thin. He is at a point where he gets angry at me whenever he gives me an excuse. I tell him just don't tell me you're quitting so I don't get disappointed and he sees that as an attack on weed. I know he's going through hell as it is.
I want to be there to support him and offer him words of encouragement but I've never been in his shoes so I am struggling with not overstepping the fine line of support and pressure.
Is there any advice that anyone can give to help me be there for him and avoid conflict but not support his addiction? Any books I can read to help me understand?
I don't want this to be a lost cause and I know he can do it because he has done it before. He is struggling with weed the most for some strange reason though. How do I help him feel stronger.. I'm at a complete loss.

Throughout this month I tried to quit twice, but it was very difficult for me, I couldn't sleep and it caused me a little bit of stress, the point is that I couldn't even last clean one single day 

I've few reasons to leave all this, first it would be for my family, also coz I'd problems with a girl I used to date, she was the person who told me to try to get help 

The first thing I'll propose is to stop smoking cigarettes, I've already talked to a person and I am gonna start going to therapy to try to quit, I am gonna start this Monday, and I hope everything goes well

I am now on my third anti-depressant and the side effects have been tolerable, but the effect is very hard to notice for me, and i still feel very depressed, suicidal, low self esteem etc. Along with the medication i have tried psychology, meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, vitamins and more, and they have all only helped for very short period of time, and then i lose motivation.

I have had problems with alchohol in the past, but i am 2 months sober now. This has helped my mood become more stable, but i am still very sad and bored, everything seems too hard for me to do, and i have no idea what to do with my life. To combat this feeling I started thinking about smoking weed, i havent tried it before and have only read about it (many articles, statistics, videos etc) I know that i probably shouldnt start smoking weed, but i am at a point in my life where i am desperate for these feelings and thoughts to go away

what should i do?",1

I have been a severe alcoholic since I got a divorce from my first wife like 10 years ago and ironically it was because she wouldn‚Äôt go to rehab‚Ä¶ we had both been drug addicts, but I landed a sweet job and came clean off all the pills and coke, meth for the random drug test they give. I was actually doing pretty well.

I was sent to Detroit with this new job and my ex-wife remained home. One afternoon on payday I went to subway to get some grub and my card declined. My buddy picked up the bill thank God. I looked at my bank account and it was shut down and was negative in the thousands. Almost had a heart attack. She got check writing happy while I was gone and boom.

We went through a divorce while I was 9 hours away from home over several months. She wouldn‚Äôt sign the divorce papers so I told her if she would I would pay back all the money she blew so she wouldn‚Äôt go to jail. She agreed. I loved my wife, but could no longer be with her. I tried to help her on several upon several occasions.

Sorry this is long winded.

Long story short I never quit drinking. I was a highly functioning alcoholic and I was killing my body. I received a dui and sad thing was that the cops couldn‚Äôt tell I was drunk. My drunk ass told them I was drunk like a call for help. Still never quit drinking.

I got with this beautiful woman and her 8 month old daughter. She knew I was a heavy drinker before hand, but I wasn‚Äôt an angry drunk. I made everyone laugh, so things were good and I could pay the bills.

My beautiful woman ended up getting pregnant and I tried to stop, but DT‚Äôs would kick in and I‚Äôd be right back to it, Bhutto in smaller doses.

After my baby was born I had to start doing things after work. So I found other substances that would sober me up completely and sadly became addicted to those too. 

My wife had enough and told me rehab or I was out. I deserved this, I know I did. I stopped being able to pay bills and was always fucked up. I make good money so there was no excuse. I wish I could do it recreationally.

I was kind of volunforced to rehab and it‚Äôs exactly what I needed after all the money I had wasted and pissed away. I took 26 99 bananas before I walked into that place.

Everything was going good, I started making several friends immediately. I had a cough tho and I smoke a lot of cigarettes. So they came and got me out of my bunk at like 1 am. And dragged me into isolation. Like I said I‚Äôve been to jail and this room made jail look like candy land.

The windows were boarded up and I wasn‚Äôt allowed to walk out into the hallway. No TV no books, just a cot. The nurses didn‚Äôt want to speak because they were terrified of Covid-19. I told them I was a smoker and probably have copd. Since I was an addict I was wrong. I wanted to smoke so bad it wasn‚Äôt funny. So I let them drug me and I slept and cried everyday for a week. The doctor gave me a line from a superhero movie. Pain would be the greatest remedy for me.

I think I was the only one there voluntarily. I got out and did good for about a month and then right back down the hole. Being fucked up for Years now and my wife‚Äôs absolutely fed up.

She wants  me to go back. i am going to go back because i love my 3 ladies sooooo much. 

i hope someone reads this and it hits home before you end up like me. I think you are awesome and I know you can do it, you have to believe.

Feel free to message me and be safe my friendsz",10

Me and my boyfriend have been together just over a year he‚Äôs 33 and I‚Äôm 25. 

I have personally never done any hard drugs (I tried weed a few times when I was a teen) I didn‚Äôt enjoy it at all, I do however like to have a glass of wine on a Saturday night whilst at home and will drink when I go out with friends. 

However he has been smoking weed ever since he was 12, he says he‚Äôs not addicted to weed however he has a joint in the morning as soon as he wakes up, lunch breaks at work and then he‚Äôll have atleast 4 in the evenings. On his days off he smokes even more. 

He also does cocaine atleast once a week to my knowledge he has said to me he has a problem with it before but he could stop if he wants too, but every Saturday night without fail he does cocaine just whilst we‚Äôre at home, if he has some leftover the next morning he will sniff it when he wakes up. He said it‚Äôs easier that way because then he can‚Äôt do it the next night. (I have suggested to just put it in the bin if there‚Äôs leftovers) he just shrugged. 

I have also meant him money in the passed which he hasn‚Äôt paid back, I‚Äôm not concerned about the money it‚Äôs more I just don‚Äôt want to be in a position where I‚Äôm funding his addiction. 


He said there‚Äôs absolutely no way he‚Äôll ever stop smoking weed and that he hates doing cocaine but he won‚Äôt stop (he‚Äôs got a hole in the middle of his nose from this)

I don‚Äôt know what to do, he‚Äôs so fine with it I don‚Äôt think he even knows or cares it‚Äôs a problem, I haven‚Äôt said anything about it to him because I don‚Äôt want him to feel bad, but I‚Äôm at a complete loss of what to do. Part of me feels that because he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue and finds it funny how many drugs he‚Äôs done/does it makes me think it‚Äôs not as bad as it is. 

I don‚Äôt want to break up with him I want to help him I just don‚Äôt know if my soul can take it

I feel like one friendship group in particular has witnessed all my mentalness and I'm basically burning up with shame. They're all close and I'm kind of on the periphery, I just turn up at events every couple of years and make an absolute fool of myself. I feel like they're all talking about how mental I am amongst themselves. None of them know (afaik) that I'm an addict but it's pretty clear I've been unstable for a long time. I feel like a joke. 

I know I can't control other people's thoughts and actions and no matter how they respond or don't respond I'm not gonna relapse this time. I can't put everyone through more of my shit especially not myself tbh. I just want to know how other clean addicts handle all the shit from the past.

The love was there for a year, but then I fell in love with heroin. That led me to the dark side.    I went from living the life, having fun with people, always out at the bars, and having love, to being on the streets, alone, doing anything I can for my next hit.   Selling drugs, robbery, assault, underground homeless fights, at one point prostitution, all to feed the love of my life.    She had a grip on me, taking over my soul.   I lost who I was.    We were in the greatest and most bizarre toxic relationship, and I was her toy.   2 years of this, and I had come to resent her, but I couldn't live without her.    Then she tried to kill me the first time.    A hospital visit and promises of staying away from her, and I was out and back in her arms.    The cold winter nights were nothing to worry about, as I had her in my life and she kept me warm.    Then she snapped and tried to kill me again.    This time I was found by a man, who saw the abuse she put me through.    He sat with me in the hospital.     He took me in after I was released.  He sat with me as I went through my withdrawals and told me that bitch would never hurt me again.   He taught me that my life was worth more then I had allowed myself or anyone to think.    I ended up leaving the city, working hard every day to hold onto my newfound strategy of hope and love.    This man and I talk weekly still.   And I am proud to say.   I have been in sobriety for over 11 years now.

I have just recently graduated college, which i never thought would happen, in the addictions and mental health field.    I have an associate addictions counselor designation to my name.

I tried rehab twice so far, but got pwds that have left me very scarred and scared to try again.
Now no one wants to help me and I don't blame them. 

I don't see anything changing and don't know how to keep going like this. Do I just keep living everyday hoping that one day something will change? I'm so miserable and making everyone around me miserable and not like me even more.

I dont do it very often, maybe once every three to four days, but the days I do it is the only thing that matters. I forget to eat, my eyes and head hurt, but I cant seem to stop and the whole day goes to waste. 

I am also very good at finding excuses to come back. If I manage to get off of my computer in the middle of the day I will later convince myself that this was a first step to quiting and I should reward me with some game time.

These things, for me provide a very rare experience of emptying your head. I am an overthinker so having all of your senses occupied at the same time is a wonderful and unique experience. Other hobbies that I have such as playing/listening to music, working out, going for a run or hanging out with friends all require some amount of brain power and actively thinking.",3

They told me that they'll help me find help and really thankful for that. So here's the part that I just wanted to share:  

I was in class earlier and we're just checking up on each other and I had a bad/good idea to tell them what I did during my asynchronous time. I came clean and I told them that I talked to my friends and told them that I'm now recovering from my addiction and if they are having a hard time in life that they should also talk to someone if they are having a hard time. Least to say when I said the words ""porn addiction"". they had to do a double take on their screens. Then we said our goodbyes and I noticed that our class vice president texted me. She asked me about what I said in the meeting and I told her that I had a porn and masturbating addiction that went so far that whenever I orgasm now, I cum blood. Welp, I singlehandedly traumatized her. But she said that she was glad that I have friends who cared about me. I found out later through a friend who's in a gc with the medalists and stuff. The president in my class told the other medalists that I had a porn addiction and now she's traumatized. So at least I know that I have the power to traumatize my batch singlehandedly. /j",2

Sorry for the long post, but thank you to anyone who reads it and provides feedback. I don't know how to write this post, but I need to express this somewhere. I realize everyone says weed isn't addictive, but to me it is, and I'm realizing how deep my addiction runs. I haven't been sober in 4 years, since a couple months after I left the Army. I've used it as a crutch in every way, my solution for literally everything is to smoke. I quit smoking cigarettes and ended up ramping up my weed smoking rapidly. I smoked through a bitter divorce. I smoked through the death of friends and family. I smoke when I'm happy, I smoke when I'm sad. It's effecting my mental health in a major way. I suffer from depression and anxiety, likely due to a traumatic childhood, and it's amplified when I smoke. While it does make me happy (sometimes) and helps to relieve daily stress, it also puts me in my head. I think too intently on mistakes, I focus on my failures and my depression brain takes over. I tend to go to a dark place and sometimes it leads me to suicidal thoughts. That's probably not the weeds fault, but it often amplifies those feelings. It makes me lazy and I've let myself go into patterns where instead of being productive I just smoke and ignore my problems instead. Every time I smoke I notice all the sensations of my body and go into hypochondriac panic attacks often. I get shortness of breath from the smoke (probably due to constant smoking my entire adult life). Anyway, I don't need to go into every detail, but I'm going to start taking my self care more seriously, and I think for me that starts with experiencing life sober. I'd love to hear feedback from others who have experienced similar things, followed a similar path, or disagree with my sentiment altogether. Thanks for reading!",34

And I was doing well in trying to fix it by replacing all of my entertainment videos with something either educational or some thing to help understand myself. But then I had another problem. 

You see, I have to play with my little sister and it requires a lot of imagination. And usually I get inspired by looking at entertainment. So when it comes time to play, because I've been entertaining myself on the internet, I already have a story in mind.

But since I've tried healing my addiction, I don't have a lot of stories in mind. Or I'll have ideas but they just don't go anywhere. And then I've gotten bored about how I tell the stories ( via toys and such). So I purposely tried to relapse so I can get my creative gears going again, but just hasn't been the same. Now I have an internet addiction again and then the one benefit that I had from it is now lost. 

My internet addiction isn't as bad as it was before tho because I used to do 100% entertainment and I couldn't sleep without it. Now I don't have to sleep with it and sometimes I do something that involves more thinking. But still, it's there and I still entertain myself a lot. 

So I guess my question is, are there any suggestions on getting my creativity back the way that it was without getting an internet addiction? Because would be very useful. Thanks",3

Here's my 2 cents:

---

I have a lot of experience with cannabis use, as it took up a large portion of my life (I'll share my story on that in another post later this week). While being milder and less harmful, Cannabis/THC trains the brain to withhold the release of natural pleasure chemicals, like Dopamine, and only release them once you give in to temptation. Same thing can happen with food, sugar, or sex.

If you feed the addiction long enough, it takes more effort to retrain the brain to no longer be dependent on external stimuli to trigger production or release of neurochemicals.

Fortunately, with cannabis, it takes less time to recover than with other substances I have encountered.",5

my mom and stepdad [m65] have been trying for around two or three weeks already to stop smoking. as far as my brother and i know, they were doing okay. they had patches and everything. 
yesterday, my brother (m15) hung out with some friends for his bday. i was there and so were our parents. my mom got so stressed out over some stupid thing she was paranoid about, she said she was gonna get cigs. i was the only one in the car with her. my stepdad drove my brother and his friends. i was trying to tell her that she didn't need one, but she bought a pack anyway. i took the car lighter cus she couldnt find any other ones, and she cussed at me and yelled to give her the lighter. i actually have a video cus i was scared of what she was gonna do to me. she fricking threatened to eat the cig she had in her teeth. she told me I'd regret it if i didnt give her the lighter. she threatened me!!! her kid! i don't want her to start smoking again, she was clean for 3 weeks. I'm allergic to smoke too. she doesn't care. she was calling herself a bad mom and a dissapointment and said my stepdad threatened to divorce her  if she smoked again. thats not good either and i doubt he said that, but they do get in huge fights every couple months and it screwed both their kids up lmao. but anyways. back to just now. i hid her cigs as soon as we got home and hoped she wouldn't notice. she did tho. she broke the fricking lock off my door to ask where they were. at 1 am. i work today. i also have a horrible time trying to get back to sleep. she obviously doesnt care about her kids or husband enough to stop smoking. shesaways been fricking crazy but i was genuinely scared in the car. shes forcing me to lie to my stepdad and idk what to do. is there any way i can help my mom stop smoking again ??",1

(Wrote a Redditor over on r/codependency.)","But they're *not*. (Which was a *really* hard lesson I've had to learn over and over and over again during the 31 years since my first CoDA meeting... and *more*.)

So NOW, I keep a note on my computer screen that reads, ""**Things are the way they are and not the way they are not. And acceptance of that is the answer to all my problems today**."" Which is essentially the message in Dr. Paul's story in the AA Big Book I read for the first time almost *45* years ago. (C&S now since early 19*84*. Took me a while to get the plug in the jug, btw. For no other reason than that I wanted things to be... *different*.)

So. In addition to that sticky note, I keep in mind that almost *everyone* has been [conditioned](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fixing-psychology/201402/explaining-behaviorism-operant-classical-conditioning), in-doctrine-ated, in[struct](https://www.google.com/search?q=social+construction+of+reality+sociology)ed, [imprinted](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_3784), [socialized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization), habituated, programmed and [normalized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(sociology)) to want things to be different than they are... even though the idea is so obviously dysfunctional.

I've picked up a lot of ""tricks"" to help me deal with my conditioning, but *none* of them have worked better than the totally portable and instantaneously available **[10 StEPs](http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-10-steps-of-emotion-processing.html)** component of [Choiceless Awareness for Emotion Processing](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/07/choiceless-awareness-for-emotion.html)... which is my way of working CoDA's and AA's 10th and 11th Steps.

But if you don't like CoDA or AA because you think they're religious cults, see all the other alternatives in [Gold-Standard Addiction Treatment](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/12/gold-standard-addiction-treatment.html). Because there‚Äôs a lot there one can select from on that ‚Äúmenu‚Äù to make abstinence and the process of real recovery easier without spending an arm and a leg at some overpriced rehab resort in Malibu.",1

And you are there using the ladder to hold yourself underwater and trying to hold on the longest. You can feel it everywhere in your body that you need to come out to get some air but you are trying so hard to keep holding on so you can win. 

To win means to not breathe. It means to live with this constant itch inside everytime you watch someone else come out for air. It means to feel the air on your fingers and longing for this feeling of freedom to be able to come out and just breathe freely even if it's just for a second. 

April 2018 is the last time I had direct access to weed. I stoped smoking half a year before then but I honestly barely remember anything from back then because it made me forget almost everything. My partner back then kept tricking me into doing it when I told him I wanted to stop because I didn't complain and was always smiling when I was high. We smoked all day everyday for 2 to 3 years. Back then I couldn't eat nor sleep without getting high. The withdrawals were so painful physically and psycologically. I had to stop because it got to a point where it made me so sick that I couldn't eat or sleep both high and sober. I remember pacing back and forth in my kitchen for 8 hours at a time. My body aching from all the stress and anxiety and exhaustion. I would go to cook food and I would forget that I am cooking. It was so recklace and dangerous. I had a child. I did all this as a mom. All the neglect of my poor baby. 

Aroping was the best thing that ever happened to me. I was finally able to leave my abusive partner and I got back on my feet. I finally went to get college degree and now I am in university. My life is so great, I live comfortably and I have goals, I am finally starting to appreciate and love myself, and my kid and I have an amazing relationship and she is so healthy and happy now. I don't understand why I still crave it. How can I want this when it was such an awful part of my life. I feel so awful eveytime. I don't want to put my child through that ever again. I don't want to put myself through that again. 

I don't know who put these toughts in the heads of people around me but everyone is denying that you can get an addiction or withdrawal from weed. It's not even just people irl, it's people I play games with all around the world that believe this. They don't even want to acknowledge that excessive use can cauz memory issues. Everytime I get asked why I don't take weed, they try to educate me on it like I am clueless or something. I can tell that they don't belive my experience. They won't even acknowledge it. They just go quiet and change subject. 

I'm supposed to go a trip soon. The first adult trip of my life. I am getting my first passport ever. This is an incredible milestone in my life to have the freedom and ressources to do this. I am visiting a friend who does weed. I explained to him my story and I think he understands. I think he believes me. He is going to be mindful of my situation and not do it around me. I trust him. I don't trust myself. Where we are going has easy access to weed and people do it casually in the streets and everything. He said we could do it together if I wanted. I'm so scared that in the moment I won't have the restrain that I have now. I am not even around it right now and I've been craving so bad all month out of nowhere. 

To go back to my analogy, this is going to be like holding my breath underwater without the ladder to push myself under. It's gonna be me in the middle of the pool suffocating with my friend just ready to pick me up and pull me out the second I am ready to give up. Because he sees weed like breatable air that is perfectly normal and healthy to want. 

I tought it would be a good idea to ask him to not give it to me if I asked. Even if I was pushy about it. I tought that it was smart to rely on my friend to help me with my addiction..iunno it felt like it was the right thing to do. I told him all my struggles with it too so he could truly understandhow hard it is. But yesterday I was talking to a common friend of ours who doesn't know my situation. I told him I was addicted and was scared of the withdrawals. He doesn't believe weed withdrawal is real. Altought he acknowledged my experience afterwards. He said that if he was in the shoes of the person that I am visiting that he would not say no if I asked for it because I am a fully grown adult and it is my responsibility to say no and stick to it. I feel so ashamed and embarrassed. I feel ridiculous for asking my friend to say no, I am not a teenager anymore. It made me realize that I am alone in this. I realized that I am not sober because of a strong will or inner strenght; I just didn't have the time, the resources, nor the access to weed, and I feel that this is the only reason why I have been sober so long. 

I don't know what to do. I want to go on the trip and this is so important for me. But I don't trust myself and I don't feel like I can rely on my friend anymore. I feel so bad for asking or suggesting that he could help me. It is not his responsibility to care for me. 

I don't even know where to start. How can I truly get rid of my addiction? What can I do to help with withdrawal if I do end up doing it? Should I be joinng an addiction group? Can I even join a group if I don't suffer everyday because of it and after being sober so long? Can you casually do something that you used to be addicted to, or am I never gonna be able to do weed again?",3

Every interview I had I won. In the last job I got promoted 2times in a row in a few months cuz I was trying my best. I had a long term relationship with an awesome and really beautiful girl. I dont want to keep dragging about how awesome I was, mainly cuz it was some time ago...   
 We broke up. We were arguing a lot... After I moved to an apartment with my friends. We often got drunk a lot and enjoyed the life. After some time, we started to smoke weed more and more. Corona came and instead of going to office I worked from home. I started to come late to work more and more often. I got so behind in the work, that I quit.   
They liked me cuz of my previous accomplishments and would even kept me if I would not quit.   


We've split with my friends from apartment cuz of shitty deal with apartment owner and I moved to other apartment rented by my sister. I still had many people's respect cuz I am quite talkative and some people admire me for some reason.   


I told my self I want to start a business make a big cash. In the mean time, I spent all my saved my from 4 years of work in a decent jobs and savings.   


At one point I had 5K saved with no dept.   


Well, Summer came I went to Italy, mountains, and was visiting girl in other country where every day we visited expensive bars and I paid for most.   
She rejected me.   


I had nothing saved, no job and wanted to move on. I did not wanted to work in a shit job so I took a loan 10K from bank for a business idea I've had.   


Well, suddenly I got 10K no job, smoked weed daily and my productivity was at it's lowest.   


Months have passed and now I have nothing from those 10K.     
I don't reply to messages with people who admired me and wanted to start a business with me cuz I am a wreck with 10K dept and no job.   
Slowly but surely day by day I became from someone who had everything in early 20s to someone who is 24 with a dept, no job, overweight eating junk food and addicted to weed & cigarettes for about 2 years... (both I did not do before)  


2 years is all it took to get here.   


There are more thinks less severe but still bad I did not mention. I dunno know how to move on. I wake up daily around 3PM feel shittier every day than before.   
  I feel unmotivated, lazy with foggy thoughts and cant focus on a task for a minute.   


I postponed a task f 2 weeks that took me 5min to complete. Before I worked 10H a day someday.   


I feel like my peak is behind. People used to say I am next Elon Musk and not a few of them. I could     not even count on both hands how many people from friends/family/co-workers told me something similar.  I cannot look any of them in the eyes now cuz I feel ashamed. Lost and angry about the whole situation.   Worst thing is, Its no ones fault but mine. I knew things when I did them were wrong but I am still doing them.   


I don't want to keep going this way cuz soon I know I can be homeless. I have maybe a month or 2 before last cash from my loan will be spent on rent.     
  I already sent a couple Cvs but got declined in each.   


Situation sucks and instead of working hard to repair it, I spent my days sleeping, being high with my pot friend and playing dota.   


People around started to notice something is not right some time ago. Some of them even told me man you need to get up, tried to motivate me but I only get angry and don't want to listen to those sort of talks.   


I don't really care sometimes. About anything anymore. It's just better to take things that way  when there is too many fucked up things to think about.",8

He is the best thing that has ever happened to us. He is the kind of guy who will drop anything to help out in any situation. My boys would call him with any problem instead of their dad.

So I had a long talk with my husband and explained my situation as best I could to someone who never even thinks of pills. I ask him to please give me 3 pills in the morning. Just leave them on bathroom counter or in a small bottle. It helps me maintain and really think before I take a pill. I asked him to please keep them away someplace, anywhere ‚Ä¶ seriously don‚Äôt want to see the bottle because I get triggered. Hard to explain this to someone that doesn‚Äôt have an addicts brain.

It did not affect my work, but it's effin my social life.

2022-01-17 08:19:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/s63vfo/boyfriends_battle_with_addiction/,Boyfriend‚Äôs Battle with Addiction,"I (27f) have recently posted on r/relationship_advice asking for advice on what to do regarding my boyfriend‚Äôs (28m) addiction to meth and how it was affecting our relationship. I received great advice on what to do, but I would also like to consider helping him get the help he needs.
I love my boyfriend dearly and seeing what his addiction does to him breaks my heart, on top of what it has been doing to us. 
A little bit of background; he‚Äôs been battling this addiction for years already, way before he and I met. I noticed that he was on meth when he would give an acquaintance of his a ride home and he left a bag of meth in the backseat of the car. I didn‚Äôt know what it was until I asked my boyfriend. He told me not to touch it and told me it was meth and he called his friend that he left that in the car and they met up so that he can give him the drugs back. When they met up, they went behind a building and I felt that something was not right. Days go by , and my boyfriend and I went to go clean the car. While I was cleaning the inside, I noticed that in the cupholder that there was rock that looked like sea salt that hadn‚Äôt been ground up, and I started to put two and two together and so I asked my boyfriend to see how he would react and his face expression changed and I confronted him and asked if he did meth and he was denying it until I poured soda in the cupholder and he was upset and finally told the truth that he was doing meth. 
Since I never met anyone who had dealt with this sort of problem, I never knew how one would get when they‚Äôre on drug. When we started living together. I started to pick up on the way his behavior would change. There are instances where he‚Äôs in the bathroom for a ridiculous amount of time throughout the entire day, where he wouldn‚Äôt sleep for a few days, where he would just nibble on food and won‚Äôt eat for almost an entire day. His whole demeanor would change and he becomes more aggressive. And there are days where he would binge eat and sleep for a whole day. but I never knew why and would just correlate that behavior with his drinking problem (another issue, but focusing on the drug addiction first). 
It never occurred to me to search him to see if he had that drug with him as I deemed it not necessary and I‚Äôm not his mom to do such a thing. I did, however, stumble upon it in his jeans when I was doing laundry and making sure all the pockets were empty before putting it in the washer. I told him what I found and proceeded to dump it in the toilet. That was a mistake as he because he became aggressive and yelled at me for throwing it away. when he calmed down, he told me that he was going to be experiencing  withdrawals, which is him basically Sleeping all day and that‚Äôs when I started to pick up on things. 
But despite me throwing it away, I found out that he would try to meet up with his acquaintance to get more, but with me unaware. this would happen for several different occasions until he cut contact with him for some time.  
Sometime around July, he started working again and he was making good money, but I noticed that he was blowing all his money in less than a week. His behavior drastically changed and found out that he was doing meth daily and that he resumed contact with his acquaintance. I begged him to stop but he told me that he‚Äôs not going to because he needs it to keep up with his job as it became even more fast paced since he became promoted. His addiction became so bad that he would trade some of his belongings or pay his acquaintance a lot of money to get meth. 
Within a month of working at that job, he started to become more paranoid whilst working there. Since his promotion, he noticed a change with his coworkers, but he would tell me that he thinks that everyone including 
Guests that they‚Äôre laughing at him or talking shit about him behind his back. He ended up walking out on the job and called me while I was working to come pick him up. 
He and I had a serious talk that he nEeded to stop and to cut the acquaintance out of his life because he was out of a job due to his addiction, his family members realized that he‚Äôs become reclusive, and he‚Äôs become very sleep deprived. With that conversation, he was sober for two months, until he relapsed again up until now. He still has that acquaint blocked, but he revealed to me that he would pull out money to go to this sketchy guy that lives in a tent by the freeway to get meth. Since then, he had me become in charge of our finances. 
And now he has a new job, working the graveyard shift, and not even a week has gone by that he ended up getting meth from one of the customers for free. But this time, he and I started to fight constantly and he‚Äôs become even more aggressive when he finds out that I threw away his drugs. I understand why he would lie to me about being on it because I would throw it away, but there was no point because he would just get it again from that same guy at his job so long as he works there. He told me that he won‚Äôt stop until we get out from our rut and that he‚Äôs only doing it to stay awake at work. Im afraid that he‚Äôll end up getting to the point of no return if he keeps it up. I‚Äôm scared for his well-being and whether our relationship will survive. I know I can‚Äôt play the hero, but I don‚Äôt want to give up on him. If I leave him, no one else would bother helping him. 
Any sort of advice would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: Boyfriend has a meth addiction, relapses right away whenever he gets the chance, doesn‚Äôt want to stop until we‚Äôre out of our rut, but I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll be far gone by then.",3

And  life is good over all. I have my dream job, chill friends, a healthy  lifestyle with exercise and adequate sleep, etc. My life is normal  again, for the most part.

However I  still suffer from occasional depression and anxiety. Covid doesn't  help. Right now I'm going through a break up and I haven't been in this  much emotional pain in such a long time. I've been with the same person  for 5 years and I thought they were the one. I wanted to marry them,  have kids and buy a house next year. We had it all planned out.

But  we're too different and we're ending things. I feel like a part of me  is missing. And I've been craving weed like crazy. I'm having constant  dreams about smoking, I even bought CBD weed

I  wasted 5 years of my life smoking weed, I will never return to that way  of life. I'm so much more productive now, but God this heart break is  killing me. And weed makes me really euphoric

So I smoked a cigar today. I don't smoke or vape. But I needed to smoke something.

The  last time smoke entered my lips, I was smoking my last joint which  caused me to have a seizure because it was laced. 2 and a half years ago  
I  feel silly. Blowing on tobacco on my front porch. But it took care of  my craving. Watching the smoke leave my mouth and drift into the night  sky somehow made me less depressed. It gave me the instant gratification  I've been longing for.

And that's  it. Im on here, reminding myself Ill never smoke weed again. Ill never  stoop that low again. Ill get rid of the CBD weed and other shit Ive  been holding onto and just smoke stupid cigars when I am at an emotional  rock bottom.",1

Hello all,

I am so glad I found this sub. I definitely want to learn more about addiction and will be reading through the posts here and if I have anything encouragement to share I will definitely offer it.

I wanted to ask if anyone has experienced negative thoughts like ""you've failed before, why will recovery work this time""? ""You can't do it""? If so, I would really like to read what you did or are doing to move past them.

For context, I've tried recovering from a behavioural addiction for many years. I've failed several times and have learned lessons from them. Whilst I remain hopeful that I can and will recover and have got back on my recovery plan and decided to engage with my reality instead of trying to escape from it, I have doubts that sometimes pop up and deep down I think I am scared that I'll never recover and I am destined to a life of relapse, trying to get back up, getting back up, relapse ....continue cycle.",1

I didn‚Äôt realize I had anxiety until I had my first Xanax at 20 years old. I thought everybody felt nervous like that all the time. Deadass. 

So specifically, the drugs that turned me to rehab were cocaine and benzos (Xanax, flualprazolam, klonopin, Valium, clonazolam, etc.) I finished the inpatient program after 4 months. I was extremely confident that I never needed drugs again. 

Originally I‚Äôm from California but my parents moved to Texas when I was 19 and living on my own. 

After rehab, I moved to Texas (I was 24 now) and well wouldn‚Äôt you know it, your addiction follows you anywhere. I found coworkers and met friends with coke plugs, xans, acid, etc. 
I moved to get away from the people, places, and things that spiraled me into a full blown addict, owing drug dealers money and stealing from my own family. But I was back at it and HARD. 
I convinced my best friend to leave CA to TX and get an apartment with me and my bf. He is a polydrug user as well (my bf doesn‚Äôt do drugs or drink at all), and it didn‚Äôt take long to get into the spiral of doing coke everyday, having to take a shitload of Xanax to counteract the negative effects of the coke. On and on it went. 
Well things went south with my best friend and we moved out of the apartment after 5 months and my best friend couldn‚Äôt afford it on his own, so we were left to our own devices. My bf (who I met in TX) had his mom and sister living in Colorado and they offered to help us get on our feet. So we did. After my year in Texas on a drug induced binge, me and my bf move to Colorado. 
Well one of my friends from TX was also from CO and had just moved back. As a polydrug user herself, I found plugs for coke again and started buying RC benzos even more. Then I got a klonopin script on top of all that. 
So my benzo use has been off the fuckin rails. I‚Äôve wrecked 3 cars, cussed out my mom, and went on road trips I don‚Äôt even remember. 

I began attending NA (virtual thanks to COVID) meetings and kept that up for a couple months. All it took was one bad day and I was asking my friend for coke. She had multiple plugs and it was just like the old times again. Back on coke binges and just being a total bitch when I didn‚Äôt have it. Then comes the benzos (which I take daily), because even when I‚Äôm not using that day, my anxiety is THAT high. I‚Äôm halfway through my month‚Äôs RX of klonopin and I got it a week ago. 
Now I‚Äôve turned to alcohol, often mixing it with benzos. I know the risks but I do it anyways. I can‚Äôt stand the feeling of being sober and I don‚Äôt know why. When I got out of rehab I stayed clean another 4 months, 8 months total. But here I am, stuck in the spiral no matter what state I move to. It‚Äôs the addict brain I guess. 

My question is, where do I move on from here? I have a job I love and don‚Äôt want to (although I may need it) go to an inpatient rehab again. Not to mention my insurance in this state is more expensive and I‚Äôm not even sure how it would work here. I just need help. A shoulder to cry on and wonder why a smart girl who got into her dream college and dropped out chose drugs and stealing over the bright future I could have had. 
Now I‚Äôm 26. 

I need help and I finally realize that (AGAIN) now. 
Oh and I got to experience alcohol withdrawals for the first time. Used a shitload of benzos and that was barely enough to feel better. Wasn‚Äôt until I drank some whiskey that I felt better. I‚Äôm broken and slipping backwards. At a super fast pace.

It‚Äôs helped me stay on the right path for years. The pharmacy has no reason to think I misuse it.

Every month when I try to fill my prescription, the pharmacy makes me jump through hoops. 

Typically, it‚Äôs outrageous wait times. I‚Äôm talking hours. I have no choice but to sit there and wait. Up to 4 hours in the past. 

Another thing they like to do is force me to get my doctor to call them before they‚Äôll fill it. They always do this on a weekend when there‚Äôs no doctor to call. I‚Äôve ended up going multiple days without my prescription because they claim the prescription is ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù.

They‚Äôve lied to my face about ‚Äúlaws‚Äù. I was once told I could not pay cash while I waited for my insurance approval. They didn‚Äôt allow me to purchase my own medication until I called another pharmacy and proved them wrong. Afterwards, they tried to tell me I‚Äôd need a new prescription from my doctor since they sold me a 2 day supply. My doctor confirmed this was false.

They refuse to give me my prescription even a day early. Even if it‚Äôs already paid for. Life happens, I can‚Äôt always get there on the exact date of the refill. They once made me sit there until midnight waiting for ‚Äúthe refill date‚Äù. It‚Äôs a 24 hour place. They‚Äôve even said I can fill it 2 days early. When I try, I get refused. That just happened today. Now I won‚Äôt be able to get it until Tuesday. I took my last pill this morning.

There‚Äôs other things but it‚Äôll take too long to type.

Is there anything I can do? I‚Äôm just tired of dealing with this every time I need my medication.

Edit: Can‚Äôt switch pharmacies. Nobody around here will order Zubsolv because it costs almost a thousand dollars a month to buy. 

A thousand dollars. For bupe and naloxone. Fucking despicable.

Oh, and please don‚Äôt say ‚Äújust stop using it‚Äù. It helps me tremendously and it‚Äôs my recovery, my choice. I don‚Äôt care if you think it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot really being clean‚Äù. It‚Äôs kept me from shooting heroin for 7 years. Which is far longer than many, many people.",1

My friend i was with had the same amount, and she was fine, but something happened to me that has never happened before. I experienced the most over whelming feeling. It was so strong i couldn't cope. I was shaking so bad, i couldnt sit still. I felt like i was going mad. I kept crying and was desperate for it to end. I couldn't breathe. It was like the worst panic attack that I've ever experienced.

Here's the thing it lasted for 5 hours! I was begging for it to end. I was so terrified, i thought it would never stop. I even screamed with the overwhelming feeling in my mind and body, it was torture. I thought i might have to actually go hospital. Because i could hardly breathe. I've had terrible come downs before, but we hadn't even finished our session. It just came from no where.
And it was nothing like the worst come down I've ever experienced, and mine are bad.

Anyway has anyone ever experienced this, and does anyone know what was happening to me?

I never ever want to experience that again. Im hoping I've been scared off cocaine forever now ü§û

I have used for the last 5 and a half years. Last two years I have binged on edibles. Throughout my abuse I used to be high pretty much throughout the day. I hit ""multiple"" rock bottoms throughout my use. About couple of months ago, I experienced severe paranoia on edibles and had to come clean to my parents because my heart was racing like a horse. My parents were really understanding although they both don't use anything - no drugs, alcohol, tobacco, etc. They took me to a hospital and helped me in the most traumatic experience of my life. I quit for about 20 days after that experience but then relapsed and started using daily. Then I quit again for a couple of weeks after which used again twice.  Both times i got caught by my cousins who were visiting and they were pretty disappointed (they know about my journey and are super understanding and supportive too). I decided to not touch it ever again. But I did it again a couple of days ago. Haven't used since but feel a strong urge, especially when night dawns. Once the thought creeps in I can't stop my brain from thinking about doing it, the craving is real. My friends still use and i fear that if I meet them i will not be able to refuse. The worst thing is that nobody feels cannabis is a harmful drug, especially my friends and that gives my mind an easy way out. It's hard to explain the struggle in words but it feels as if I am fighting my own mind. 

Please, anyone with any suggestions are welcome. I dont want to do it again and it seems like i will at some point.",14

I know exactly what‚Äôs causing me pain, which is causing me to use. But what can you do about death? I just go in circles of self pity and finding comfort in the devil I know (drugs) instead of the unfamiliar devil (sobriety).

Not looking for validation- just truth.

I'll keep it brief. I had to quit weed (which I was doing every day) and cigarettes recently in order to prep for a surgery in a few months. So I took some morphine. It was a small amount and I probably didn't do enough to get me as high as I thought I was (psychosomatic response), but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since.Got super drunk tonight in order to stop myself from trying more.

As I type this, the answer seems pretty clear. But can you really be considered an addict after only doing something once? Should I go to a meeting? Blah.

Thanks in advance.

It started as just something fun to do at parties and that was it for a long time. About six months ago, my mother died of cancer. She was everything to me. My emotional support, my rock, and my best friend. When she died, I felt so....empty. Thats when my addiction got out of control. Because my mother had left me 30,000 when she died I then had  was emotionally damaged and had to funds to fuel it. I'd do at least an eight ball a night. I bet I spent nearly 10,000 alone on it. After the money was gone though, I fell into a severe depression I had even had several suicide attempts. I tried to get psychological help but everyone in my area either were super expensive or would make you wait three months before they'd see you. So my addict brain thought, I could wait three months for medication or I could get a G in thirty minutes and feel better faster. I'm now at a point where it's affecting my relationship. My fiancee just broke up with me because of my addiction. He had said for a while he wanted to stop but my grief addled brain wasn't hearing it. Tonight I went too far. He told me not to get any cocaine but I took it as he was trying to control me so as a ""fuck you"" I went and got it any way. He was so fucking hurt by this and says he can't trust me. What do I do? I didn't expect him to leave. How do I fix this?",2

While this message can be used by anyone who suffers from addiction, I‚Äôm hoping this message finds someone who is really suffering, like I have and still do. Because all it took for me to start trying on the path to recovery was ONE persons message that felt like it was directed directly to ME. Even though it wasn‚Äôt his message hit my soul and changed my life and I‚Äôm here to pay it forward in any way I can. This message is for someone at the rock bottom of rock bottom, I hope you realize that you are and extraordinary human being. So yes if that‚Äôs you this is for you.

I‚Äôm a poly drug addict, I‚Äôve been using since I was 16 and I‚Äôm now 23. I can‚Äôt think of something I haven‚Äôt done except for the more obscure research chemicals. I was never the type of Addict who was over prescribed medication and doctor shopped and did all that. Once I started with drugs and alcohol I didn‚Äôt get the gradual decent into ruin. I jumped dick first into the fire ant hill with the shit, I went hard and I went fast, and every day I thought ‚Äúhopefully this is the last. I was already suffering mental illnesses such as depression severe anxiety, and ADHD and I was a kid in my childhood was never perfect but that‚Äôs not what this is about. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned and I hope you can learn to.

We addicts are blessed beyond belief and I genuinely mean this. All the pain and devastation, the misery, suffering, self loathing, and the isolation, suicide attempts, overdoses, robberies, homelessness and everything that you‚Äôve been through puts you in a unique position. 

You see you‚Äôve already experienced the lowest that mankind has to offer you. Your pain is a gift, it will give you an edge that you never knew possible if only you believe in yourself. I know it might be hard to believe but as an addict we have the most faith out of anybody I believe. Every morning you wake up without even having a job you can be homeless and you‚Äôll still grind and hustle your way a bag of dope. The whole time I was homeless and jobless I was never Dopesick. Because I had faith in myselfThat I could do whatever it takes to get that bag. Being sick was not an option to me, I would rather die. Heroin what is my master that was my religion that was my faith. Heroin pushed me to do things I never thought I‚Äôd ever do, But I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable talking about it this point in my life, maybe one day but not today.

We had faith before we even caught that our dealership was going to get us high. I don‚Äôt know about you but how many of you, bought drugs from a dealer who you know sells bunk out of pure desperation and you just hope and pray to god it gets you high. Normal people don‚Äôt have that kind of faith. No normal person is going to spend $20,000 on a car from a dealership that they knows sells lemons. You might think that stupidity, honestly kind of is but we know it is, instead we have faith that maybe this onnnee time their shit won‚Äôt be bunk. That‚Äôs incredible to me. It might not seem credible than most people but it is mean if you really think about it. 

If we take that faith and put it into ANYTHING else, god could you imagine. If we took that hustle in that grind from our deepest depths of addiction and put it into any job, could you IMAGINE, we‚Äôd own the fucking company in a few years. We could sell a matchstick underwater if that‚Äôs what it took to get high. Use your pain to win, use your faith to to keep winning. It‚Äôs time to change your perspective. Your not weak, every addict I ever met are stronger then any billionaire I ever met or heard of. And every addict that I‚Äôve ever met that not only realized this but loved this are doing great things. Never give up, the fight only stops when you stop, NEVER EVER stop.

With that thank y‚Äôall for reading I hope this touches at least one person and makes a difference in your life. As a fellow addict and human being anything that ANYONE needs, addict or not, message me, I‚Äôm here. All the love guys!",4

My sister (42) acknowledges that she is an alcoholic. She used to drink two bottles of wine each night, but noticed she was getting a belly, so switched to something beer-ish with fewer calories (she will compare labels at the store to find the one with the highest alcohol content). She has attempted to cut back and/or stop drinking altogether countless times over the last few years, but the attempts are short lived. She recently asked her boyfriend to keep her alcohol at his house (they don't live together) and for him to give her 4 a day. That lasted a few days and then she started drinking the 4 he gave her, but also ordered some for delivery to her house without her boyfriend knowing. He texted me worried last night after she admitted to drinking more than he was divvying out. He said when she stays at his house she sleeps on the couch so she can continue drinking after he goes to bed. She told me yesterday that she bought 6 boxes (6 cans per box) on Thursday to tide her over the storm expected this weekend, and was planning to get more after work. 

She went to an AA meeting once but felt guilty because she was still drinking and didn't want to stop, and it was based around religion more than she was comfortable with. She never went to another meeting. 

She worked with a counselor for a short time to reduce the amount she was drinking, but not abstain completely. That lasted a few weeks.

I've sent her information a few times on naltrexone and The Sinclair Method, and she seems really interested, looks into it, but never follows through.

She began taking edibles to help reduce the amount of alcohol she was drinking. It helped for a few months, but now she's drinking more than ever and taking the edibles, too. 

She says she doesn't want to stop drinking, it's more fun to drink, everyone has a vice, and it's how she copes (she is also on antidepressants). 

She isn't yet experiencing any legal, health, work, or relationship issues due to her drinking. Her doctor (who told her years ago that she is an alcoholic) checks her liver function each year, and it was normal two months ago when last checked. She drinks at home alone for the most part, and never drives while drinking (she doesn't need to since she can afford delivery regularly). She now works from home, so has started drinking earlier, but her work performance isn't suffering. She doesn't get belligerent or mean when she drinks, and doesn't borrow money from people to support the habit. I usually don't even realize she's drunk. 

How do we convince her she needs help when there are seemingly no reasons for her to stop?",2

Now as of about a year ago, i started heavily smoking weed. It started off as a ‚Äúnighttime routine‚Äù to a wake and bake and nighttime routine, to a can‚Äôt go through my daily life without it.

As I used the two together so frequently they‚Äôve almost become one drug. So I can‚Äôt smoke weed without nicotine and don‚Äôt want nicotine without being high.

I am self aware of how neither of these benefit me. I honestly have gotten to the point where using either of the substances I get more side effects then enjoyment.

She was also a close friend. When she lived with me it was traumatic. I tried so hard to help and when my efforts were finally successfully, she decided that she couldn‚Äôt talk to me because I use cannabis occasionally. There are so many stories that are just too triggering to repeat but this person traumatized me, put me through hell, stole my klonopin regularly, lied all the time‚Ä¶ you know how it goes.

Now she‚Äôs doing the 12 steps with only 5 months of sobriety and she tried to apologize as one of the steps encouraged her to do. She gave me a half assed apology and then acted like I owe her forgiveness. She said that if I don‚Äôt forgive her she can‚Äôt move forward with her recovery. Well I‚Äôm not ready, I am not bringing up the horrors i went through before finally kicking her out. I ended up being evicted because the ambulance showed up too many times. I don‚Äôt even want to think about. I was also disgusted that she turned her back on me the second she had a few new friends. I do not lie and I won‚Äôt forgive until she shows me that she deserves forgiveness. An apology means Jack shit, how about offering to help me pay rent for the months that I paid for both of us?

Her sponsor then called me and tried to convince to not just forgive her, but get this, apologize for upsetting her. Wow. I lost 20 lbs during those 6 months due to STRESS. I look older. It was f***ed up and I don‚Äôt see why she can‚Äôt be sober without my forgiveness.

To those of you in recovery: I‚Äôve noticed that it is very easy for addicts to forget alll the terrible things they did and it is very frustrating if one day someone is stealing from me and the next day they‚Äôre in AA and feel like they can give me life advice.

Should I just lie and give her a bs apology? Is it bad that I don‚Äôt care about whether or not she stays sober? I‚Äôm not a monster I‚Äôm very hurt and have PTSD from a few certain events.

Remember, I am not an addict and I don‚Äôt know much at all about these self help groups so please forgive me if I‚Äôm not keen on recovery philosophy etc.

That being said I wish anyone battling addiction the best of luck, I wish her luck as well I am just not able to truly forgive all the stuff she did to me.

Hi everyone,

I would like to firstly say that this sub has been nothing short of amazing in giving me guidance throughout the past year or so. I have read a lot of posts and gained so much insight. 

From July-Nov 2021 I was an absolute train wreck. Manic depression, anxiety, drug addiction, porn addiction, overweight - no clear way out. See previous posts for more details. 

I made a promise to myself (about 6 weeks ago) after this one night of doing 2 grams of cocaine that I would change my life. No more drugs, quitting alcohol, quitting porn, going to the gym again, eating healthy, saving money. 

I can honestly say that I‚Äôve stuck to my word minus the porn part (lol). I‚Äôve lost 4kg, go to the gym 4-5 times a week, saved $ and not drank any alcohol or done any drugs. 

If anyone knows anything about Buddhism and the four noble truths, they‚Äôll know that humanities cause of suffering is the craving of desires. Being deluded and controlled by short term pleasures. Once you free yourself from this you are on your way to nibbana (liberation). I can confidently say the cravings and attachments I had to these substances and short term sources of pleasure are gone.  I don‚Äôt feel the need to engage in these activities anymore. It doesn‚Äôt even cross my mind. My body spirit souls and mind are focused on improving myself and all work in unison. No more cravings or thirst. 

How one does this is completely up to them. It comes from within. 

I feel like this is finally it.  I‚Äôve got my life together and I can‚Äôt see myself reverting back to old ways. 

I hope this can inspire someone reading this who is battling and thinks there is no way out. 

Peace.",4

My first memories of life were so confusing, I wanted to understand life but since I couldn't I just moved on relying on my parent's to back me up. Then in school was always that weird kid that has no good social skills. I noticed it the first time in elementary school but didn't cared much about it, it developed on me as I entered to mittle school and definitely it high school affected me the most. When I turned 13yo I became a Christian and my life changed for food a lot. There I met my actual wife and I made a lot of friends from that church, life had a meaning now for me and I trusted mine to God in order to live a good life and good human, as that is the way you're told to do so. I was still a kid and life was so simple for me. A couple years later I got more into agnosticism and made up my own perspective of reality. I stopped worrying on sinning and started living my life on my own way. My lack of social skills on high school brought me a lot of insecurities, which it only made the situation worse and more socially awkward. At first it didn't affect me a lot, but as time months passed by I realized everyone had made their own friends and shit while I was still alone most of the time. I was afraid to talking to girls and be rejected for the way I am. ""What I'm supposed to say if I talk her?"", ""How do I present myself to her?"", ""What would I do if she doesn't seem to like me?, etc. I was jealous of mostly others for at least be into one small group of friends that are always together, especially in lunch break. I hated seeing everyone in lunch break sharing their time with others while I was there in front of them alone doing nothing. I didn't use to naturally engage in any specific group and the anxiety from it made me hate myself for being this way. It was so humiliating that I started to turn my hate against these people. I punished myself so hard for being like this that I eventually developed a serious depressive disorder. I was just turning 18yo and I didn't have any idea of what I wanted in life, I didn't even knew who I was, life expectations were far from the reality I was facing. Had no motivations whatsoever and at times just wanted to kill myself.

That was before drugs. Once I tried weed it didn't last much until I was smoking meth and injecting heroin. I absolutely fell in love with drugs. On them at least I could numb my pain as well as to escape this boring and feel like in heaven for a couple of hours. reality for a couple of hours. At first I thought I had finally found that little missing piece that I had always been looking for. Then paramedics had to revive me to tell me this ain't a game. Even though I knew it was harmful to me I kept doing all kind of drugs no matter the consequences. I keep turning into the needle and shooting up doses of heroin everyday until I got addicted and knew what it is like to go through withdrawal. Then for the first time I tried to stop and faced the reality of being hooked up  to a substance. I was able to quit for some time but at the end I always found myself next to a spoon and a needle. After so many relapses I understood what everybody told me about addiction. It took me many years of experience to realize the severity of this.

Now I just went out of rehab and the first thing I shouldn't have done was the first one to do. I straight called to my dealer and scored a gram of heroin. I did it because I already knew that sooner or later I was going to use against my will anyway so why bothering on taking the time? I had been 5 months without being anything and being out would bring a lot of temptations to not get caught up by any. I would get a couple days days and say that I was done, but every time I was release I was back on the run. Honestly it felt so, so good when emptying out the bag and the brown liquid gets on the spoon. I know I shouldn't have thought it this way again, especially after spending almost half a year in a rehab center where you're supposed to recovery, instead I should felt remorseful and unwell for the step back, but I just didn't care. I just wanted to go back and feel that rush again right after pulling back until there is blood in the syringe. Shit man it gives me goosebumps. 

I wish to end up one day with this hell. The problem is that I trully really need to want to quit drugs and I don't feel ready for that yet. I fucking love getting high I am not gonna lie and tell it doesn't, though it hurts me to hurt others while I do this harm to myself.

Now it's like I'm tired of trying to change and always failing a couple days later. It's fucked up.",6

You should be aware of that moment,"Self pity does lead to relapse. The whole 'poor me, poor me, pour me another drink' has always rung true for me. I was having a shit time drinking, then got sober and realized I felt even more shitty underneath. All kinds of depressing shit started too happen, I was feeling the ""something bad is going to happen"" feeling all day. We shouldn't forget we're in control of how we feel. 

There will be another moment when I think: not this, not now, another fucking thing on the pile of shit I have to deal with, fuck it. But fuck ""fuck it"". I have to be aware of the ""fuck it"" moment, and take a step back, since every other step after that would otherwise be self destructive. ""WHEN will I catch a break? When is my reward? Why do other people have it so much better, even those who are suffering seem to be doing ok? Plus, the whole world is collapsing! Fuck it!"" 

We will get rewarded, we will catch a break. Just not right now, we are in a process and it gets easier each time at a ""fuck it"" moment you decide to take on that extra bit of suffering. The next day it feels like nothing, until a new fuck it moment arises. Life rewards those who suffer through it, even though they feel no joyous moments may come to them soon, and they have caught no moment of rest or joy in the days behind them. You go on, because you know people with the near-exact same set of circumstances have done the same, and have lived a satisfying life. It's a long trek and while you feel weak, you actually are building resilience. You accept your fate, the next time 10 different annoying fucking things happen to you at once and there is no escape. Just say: oh well.
 Then they seem to resolve slowly one by one, because we're taking our damn time.",12

I'm lowering my expectations of myself on every other front right now so I don't stress out about failing in my life,"I get triggered into wanting to sedate myself as I see I fail at simple tasks like socializing, cooking, cleaning, working out and work. I wake up, already stressing out about being in pain and having to do all these things. Fuck it. I'm sick. I took a shower. I plan to watch television today, be warm, and drink tea. I have started the day succeeding in this. Then slowly I can gravitate to other matters. 

There's no reason to make this any harder for yourself. You do this because you love yourself. You coped by drinking and treating yourself with drugs because you want to experience love. So now that you ran out of this synthetic form of love, have patience. You don't suddenly become a loser by taking it slow. You are building day by day and test what discomfort you can take and when you need to slow down. This is trusting your body and mind again. You do what you can - do I rest now, or can I put aside short term comfort by doing the dishes, so I can eat a good meal that strenghtens me? 

I might not believe this positive spin in a few hours. But if I keep at it, maybe it will stick. Humans can withstand an insane amount of suffering and still thrive. Just dial back your demands of what makes you a successful human being, see each day as a battle in a war. You can lose a battle, but tomorrow you may have slept just a little bit better, and you surprise yourself. Sometimes you do good by going to a social situation, but sometimes it's good to stay at home when you feel you're not ready - withdraw from battle to win the battle of tomorrow. You want to win the war. Keep fighting.",21

I can't believe it!,"I never thought I would get here. I've had an opiate addiction for several years. I've been sober coming up on two years now! I finally got help and got placed on Suboxone as a replacement therapy. 

I thought for a long time I was just stuck like this. I could not imagine not taking the maximum dose every day. I knew it was better than using but I still felt trapped, especially when I would overuse and run short at the end of the month. That was the worst. But little by little I realized that less actually does more and that I just wasn't enjoying myself anymore. 

Today my doctor officially switched me to 2mg strips!! And I feel great! I don't feel the addicts grasping fear of losing out on some potential high. I can't believe it. I never could have imagined myself here just a year ago. 

I don't know what the point of this is. I'm not trying to rub it in anyone's face, of course. I guess I'm just... really, really proud of myself and this is the only real forum I have to express that. I hope this isn't against the rules.

Anyways, if you've read this long: if you are struggling *please* give replacement therapy a real shot. I know it's not for everyone and it can seem completely hopeless but you are stronger than you realize. Being an addict is *hard*. It takes actual work and dedication to maintain, going out every day trying to rustle up money, find someone, wait and wait and that doesn't even touch all the work of trying to appear to loved ones like everything is AOK. Seriously, that takes actual willpower - you have it in you it's just been trained in a certain direction. And it can be trained in another direction, even though the process *sucks*. Please be proud of yourself and take care!

My best friend in the whole world a kid I grew up with, since middle school we were friends, died last year from fentanyl. A drug I introduced to him, for my own benefit. I turned his house into a smack den. He never touched the shit till he found out I was using. 

And I played it down because initially he freaked out. I was basically living at his house for free (I was homeless at the time) he had such a good heart invited me in under the best intentions. I hid it for a while. Eventually he caught on and freaked when I came clean. But then I told him ‚Äúno man it‚Äôs just like Percocet, try a little bit‚Äù eventually he bit. And that was the biggest regret I‚Äôll ever hold in my life.

I really feel like it is so hard to even live. I‚Äôve oded, intentionally, unintentionally, hung myself twice and put a gun to my head every few days. I cry until I have no tears to spare. It‚Äôs so fucking hard to know if I would have never known him a great person would still be in this world.

I deserve this fucking hell I live in, I deserve every fucking needle in my arm, every fucking bench I sleep on, every fucking tear that won‚Äôt fall from my face no matter how much I wanna cry, every tear that falls when I don‚Äôt wanna cry, because, it should have been me. My god it fucking should have been me. If I could trade my life for his no bullshit I would in less then a heart beat, I swear to god (like g shit if someone knows the devil I‚Äôll sell my soul right now to bring him back). I don‚Äôt even like me life anymore. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs worse, being stuck in hell, or knowing this is where I belong.

I‚Äôm done trying to get better and letting everyone down. I‚Äôm done constantly being reminded that hope, isn‚Äôt for people like me. All it is is a tease. I‚Äôve been to rock bottom more times then I can count. This is something else, this is complete hopelessness, self hatred, and post destruction.

This is probably not written as well as it could be at all and obviously there's a lot more to to than this one particular situation but... I 28 f have been with my partner 25f around a year, she's been clean from a 5 year crack and heroin for nearly 2 years now without any prescription etc which is utterly incredible and I don't have the words to express how proud I am of her for overcoming that, I've never touched anything other than weed and alcoho so I don't know the struggle personally but I grew up in a family where I've seen the effects of long term addiction from both drugs and drink and until my new partner always had a rule that I'd never date anyone that took drugs (I've nothing against those that take them, a lot of my friends do, it's just a personal boundary)  My girlfriend has been struggling with cocaine since we got together, almost all of her friends take it regularly, they know she's trying to stay clean, they're aware that when she drinks she will want to take it and yet the only time they want to hang out is when there's drugs/alcohol involved. I used to go with her, have a few drinks with them, every time she had no intention of taking anything but it always ends up with one of them dangling the front of her urging her to take it with them. I understand that for someone with an addiction being in that position is going to be so incredibly difficult to say no. All credit to her, she never lies to me about what she's taken and will tell me straight up without me even asking. Ive got rid of two people I considered to be my best friends for the last 15 years because they bought her a bag knowing her history with drugs and how much she was struggling to stay clean. And would never knowingly put her in an environment where anyone that we were were g to be with we're taking anything. When we aren't around her friends (or those two ex-friends of mine) she stays clean for weeks, things in our relationship are great, we literally laugh constantly from waking up to going to sleep, we discuss our future, her mental health picks up after the come-down/session depression passes until one of her friends pops back up again and she's gotta pick the pieces back up. When she's drunk/high she has a wicked tongue and doesn't particularly give two shits about anyone or anything, until she's sobered up and then she's emotional and needy, she gets depressed because she relapsed and its awful to watch her go through the cycle until she's got her confidence back to stay clean again. Im not gunna lie and say it doesn't break my heart a little every time it happens because it does, but I just want to help her and to see her get through this and thriving, she's quite honestly the most incredible person I've ever met in my life and I'd love nothing more to spend the rest of my life with her. I understand there's going to be ebbs and flows being with someone with an addiction and I don't wanna be THAT person that suggests that she shouldn't be friends with these people.. but in all honesty, these friends seem to only want to know her when theres drink/drugs involved but when she's in a bad way and the pieces need picking up, thwyre nowhere to be seen, her messages go unread or read and ignored. that doesn't feel like friendship. She's distanced herself a fair bit which definatly helps her stay clean but one of them always ends up popping up (today one came rou d while we were working  we work from home and I've been staying with her for a few weeks, we had plans this evening but they went out the window because as soon as we logged out she couldn't get the thought out of her head of going round. I did not go, it's not an environment I want to be in and I feel awful for assuming she's going to come back high but it's what happens every time) I don't really know what to do

Here I (25m) am, back again to let off some steam. So far things are going well with my bf (24m), all things considered. Since he returned from rehab, he's been upfront about when he has cravings to smoke crack and whether he needs support or alone time. I'm usually happy to provide either.

It's been tough since I can't just make everything better for him. When he starts feeling like he wants a hit, he tries to smile and tell me that, even though he wants some, he's ok when it's obvious he's not, but what can I do? I just tell him I'm here for him and I love him.

Sometimes we watch movies and order take out to get his mind off of it. Go for walks or read books together, maybe visit the humane society since we've been debating getting a pet. Or he'll do his own thing since he loves drawing.

He's asked me to quit drinking myself. His drinking wasn't as problematic as it used to be but he knows that getting drunk makes the cravings for crack even worse so he's better off not being around alcohol. I agreed to this without thinking it would be difficult.

For the most part, it's not. I'm no alcoholic. But I do kinda miss being able to have a beer once in a while. I could go out with some friends without him but in a way, if I stay sober, it's more like the two of us are in this together. Even though I'm not addicted to drinking, it's still pretty hypocritical of me to expect him to stay clean and sober while I get drunk myself.

Anyway, I guess that's all for today, thanks for reading this far.",5

But it can be hard watching TV or going to the store, with the ads for and aisles for liquor and how accessible it is. The pills have been a lot easier to quit, oddly. Simply cut the people I buy from out of my life and try not to think about it. I only have three people I know, now, that could/would get me junk. One of them, I live with. And that's not possible to change any time soon. One other is a kinda friend I talk to occasionally, but he's going through recovery right now, too. The last is my best friend who, despite being an active addict, wants me to stay true to my sobriety. So I feel confident enough to maintain that relationships. Though my roommate situation might change once I can manage it.

But every time I pass the alcohol aisle at Walmart or Price Cutter, my desire spikes. It's easier to not buy anything knowing I'm usually strapped for money. But I'm wondering if the cravings like that will ever go away. Even morphine was easier to drop. Granted, I didn't do that one long.

But, I'm happy so far. At least, with my sobriety. I have a lot of deep emotional trauma I still need to face. But that's what therapy is for. I did all of this without any real help, too. I kinda find that cool. I dunno, maybe that's egotistical.

Oh, tomorrow is also my 30 days off of cigarettes, too. Which were amazingly easy to surrender this time. Took 5 tries, but I haven't had many cravings for cigs this round.

Overall, I'm doing things healthier. I'm in therapy and PT, I have case management, I'm looking at getting a better apartment, and I might even be able to afford some nice things once in a while. I haven't had an ER visit in a long time, either. My last one was part psychological but mostly ""almost"" ODing. Losing friends can have strong reactions.

Male, 21 years old and come from a family with addiction issues. Started drinking in high school at parties and on weekends sometimes, never became a daily issue at the time.

It was when I started smoking weed around graduation that I realized I have addiction issues because I smoked pretty much everyday since then (3 years ago now) and have tried to quick pretty much everyday since and failed. Put the weed down cause of anxiety in Dec 2020 and picked up drinking. Boy oh boy was I in for a ride of a life time. What followed was Jail, misery, hopelessness, complete severance of relationships, regret, financial problems, etc. Keep in mind i‚Äôm not diagnosed depression or pretty much anything. before alcohol the first 20 years of my life were just fine and completely normal. I come from a VERY close family of 7 people, (2 married parents of 30 years and 4 siblings of whom i‚Äôm very close with) Which goes to show just how incredibly powerful this drug is and what it can do to even somebody who is well situated.

Was always self aware of everything I did and what I was doing to myself, just couldn‚Äôt stop. I went from drinking 2-3 Tall cans of beer daily in December 2020 to drinking 1 litre of vodka daily by the time May 2021 came. I pretty much dealt with what a typical alcoholic would have dealt with in the span of their 40 year battle per say, but crammed into the span of 5 months. It was ridiculous. 

Went to rehab June 1st 2021, haven‚Äôt drank since. That is‚Ä¶ until 5 days ago. I am fed up with these labels I give myself and believing that I cannot sip on alcohol for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm a person who is hyper-aware of addiction and how it works as I study it all the time and live it, so I have come to the conclusion that if I am in a good place in my life and feel stable, I can drink. And to put it simply, so far, so good‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm that person who is talking to my friend at the bar and while he‚Äôs telling me something, i‚Äôm just thinking about how he hasn‚Äôt sipped on his drink for the past 10 minutes.. wondering how? why? because I would have had my first 3 beers finished in 5 minutes to get the convos started. I am FASCINATED by people who leave the bar with their drinks half full, it doesn‚Äôt compute in my brain. Relatable eh? 

Therefore, i‚Äôve taken this knowledge and I am now applying it to my lifestyle. I drank one beer on January 10th, decided to leave a little bit in the glass as I walked out. Drank another beer January 12th, left a little bit in the glass again. Drank 2 beers tonight, stopped myself before going further.

I know I am putting myself at risk for what happened last time, all i‚Äôm trying to say is that I guess for a person that has brain abnormalities (addiction predisposition), it is taking A LOT of will power to do this, but so far I feel like I can do this. I‚Äôm not saying that all of a sudden I don‚Äôt have those addict tendencies like before, it took absolutely EVERYTHING inside of me to leave those last sips in and walk away, and to not go to the liquor store and get more, because fuck I really wanted to. So I guess for us ‚Äúaddicts‚Äù if you want to drink again, obviously you can BUT it WILL come at a price. And that price for us ‚Äúalcoholics‚Äù is a very, very strong will power and mindset to control it. Some of us just may not be able to afford it.

Ok, so before we get started, I just  wanted to tell y'all a bravo for trying/ and succeeding to overcome your addiction(s). It takes so much strength and will power to do this, and you're gonna get though this ‚ù§Ô∏è

Y'all are amazing ü•∞

Sorry in advance but this post is going to be a little long, beacaue I'm stoned and I really need to vent right now.
Now, my story.

As long as I can remember, my childhood was messed up. Not ""that bad"" but my mothe barely even looked at for me when I was a child, gaslighting me, threatening me to sent me to the orphanage, well you got the picture. (thanks god she's better now).

She was just SO emotionally cold towards me, and I felt like I didn't even exist. Like a ghost. She was in a depressive state too I think (and I understand that), but please, just send me to a foster family who will actually love me instead of keeping me in this environment who's going to mess my mental health permanently.

Then, i started to throw thanthrows because I just wanted to have some attention from my parents, but all they did was be angry at me.
My dad told me I was crazy, unrecoverable.etc and my mom said I was ""born mad"".
All I wanted for them is to tell me things like ""what's make up angry like that"", ""explain it to us, maybe we can help"" 
But nooo, everytime they sent to to the psychiatrist like this was some kind of magic cure that would make me ""normal"" again.

It was verbal agression after verbal agression.
My dad even told indirectly to my mom that he regret my birth multiple times, told me I would never be a doctor when I'll grow up one time because my grades weren't good enough, and my mom told me she thought she would be happy by having me but I'm only making her feel worse. And there's a lot of things like that but it would be too long too explain



Anyway.
Enough with the childhood trauma and now let's talk about the long term consequences of that.
I have been suffering from anxiety as long as I can remember. Obsessive over particular things  (like checking me bag 5 times before going out, make sure I locked my apartment etc), having nervous twitches (blinking exes excessively, twitching my mouth etc) and all of that.

My first psychiatrists gave me benzos, xanax usually.
And oh boy. This is where it all started.
The first time i took it it was like total silence.
No internal thoughts screaming at me how ugly, worthless and stupid I am, but pure peace. Just a big break that made me feel normal again.
Imagine walking into a desert for hours, dehydrated, and you can suddenly drink your favorite drink. Best feeling in the worst, isn't ?

I got xanax every 3-4 months and back then I took it reasonably at first (like, not everyday).Then , I started to take 1 per day, 2 per day, 3 etc...
And most of the time I binged it and took like 2-3 mg once or twice a week.

It's important to say that I went to multiple doctors to  get xanax or any benzo at this point. I got the meds, and usually i ate the pills in 2 days or even one night,. resulting in a mass mindfuck the next day because I'm incapable of remember what the hell I did last night, mostly sending cringy messages to people, going on shopping sprees to buy some useless craps like dolls, plushies, furbies or makeup ‚ò†Ô∏è)

I remember (I don't really remember at all actually, I had sort of ""flashbacks"" when I saw something I bought when I was out of it etc) this night where I straight up took like 13-14mg one night and I literally blackout for a week ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) I genuinely though my account has been hacked but no, it was just me posting stupid stuffs.

I'm also taking Prozac, which helped me a liiitle bit for my anxiety (but I'm going to talk about my psychiatrist because I feel like Prozac isn't working anymore,l
I've been ""xanax sober"" since like, 3 months (I almost quit cold turkey honestly. I know it can be dangerous and I don't recommend it to anyone. It was horrible, I couldn't sleep, I was sick after eating, constant nausea, slight plain and the list goes on)  but since I have a lot of anxiety since a few weeks, I just couldn't resist anymore.

I feel like crap, because I was like ' I want to know i'll be able to control my xanax consumption because i haven't take it in months, but obviously, no lol.

So I'm definitely going to talk to my therapist about it next week.",5

Ok my ex has been acting really bad. This has been going on for a long time, and I'm starting to think he's been on drugs and did a rlly good job at hiding it from me. He can't keep jobs, ruined his friendships and family relationships, always asking for money, never has money, etc etc etc literally all the signs of drugs. Would drive far away frequently and say he has no money for gas and call me for money to drive back that he needed to go on a drive. Can't complete any basic tasks.... spends like 3 hours a day shaving his face ... 


So, the other day, he came in our house (my moms where I live) and went in the shower two hours, puking and pooped himself. My moms shower tiles are loose and there was no bath mat and all the water was puddle on the floor and her ceiling is now like cracking and breaking and leaking water. When she noticed she asked him to get out and he wouldn't so she manually
Shut off the water then he came said rlly messed up stuff to her .. we haven't Beene together but I let him stay over sometimes since he has nowhere too live, after that I said I don't want him here bc he's clearly unstable (he told me this happened bc he realized he was raped as a child but listen to this)...

Today. He asks to see the kids i I say okay, but my car broke down and my mom left me her car to use today so I could do 2 weeks of laundry & groceries. Said he could meet us at laundry mat. He sat in our car sick and I had to stop for him to puke then he shit himself in my moms car, went in to take a shower again, I said he neeede to leave asap bc my mom will be home. Left and came back ten mins later in shitted pants that I let him have bc he has nothing else and showered again puked again and I said look u regally have tk go now go to ur moms. He finally left but idk what to think. 




Is there drugs that cause stuff like this to happen??? Someone pls help me see what's going on

Edit : he asked me at 3am if he could shower herrr shit himself
Again so I I said okay, saw his state and said he could sleep here for a few hours. He looks awful. He couldn't make it to his moms and I'm not gonna let him die in his car.",41

I‚Äôm getting the therapy I needed I could never really get anything from while I was using and everything is coming together, and tonight I was thinking back on the old using days cause I like to remember the shitty things so I remember why I want to stay clean. I remembered when I was going hard on cocaine, I was in a shitty midwestern town and the shit was always garbage.

We‚Äôve been together for 11 years and have been married for 6. We have a beautiful baby girl who‚Äôll turn 6 months tomorrow. 

The past 11 years. My husband has been addicted to weed, cigarettes, beetlenut mouth refreshers and screens. 

I‚Äôve been aware of his addictions all these years and have tried to get him to lessen the quantity over the years. Beetlenut went from 20 packets a day to 5/day. Cigarettes stopped cold turkey last year. Screen time is an ongoing process and last but not least, weed. Went from smoking everyday to twice a month. 

I see how hard he‚Äôs tried. For me, for his family, for his health. It must‚Äôve been impossibly hard to do all that without counselling.

The problem lies with weed. 2 years ago he was diagnosed with CHS (cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome). He has these intense attacks of nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and facial paralysis. He told me he‚Äôd work on quitting for his own health. Each attack was worse than the last and each attack was a visit to the ER. After the first attack, he told me that he‚Äôd let me know if he ever had the urge to smoke again. 

Fast forward 6 months later, he‚Äôd been smoking without telling me and I, on multiple occasions asked him calmly but he denied it maybe 17 times. I was 2 months pregnant and was driving him to the ER with him fainting on the street outside the ER. He betrayed my trust and lied to my face many many times.

This time he swore he‚Äôd quit or let me know if the urge arose. Fast forward to yesterday. Had been smoking the last few months and kept lying to my face denying every time I asked. Suddenly, last night, he collapses in the tub and his face is paralyzed again. I grab our baby who had just gone to sleep, and rush all of us to the ER amid COVID.

I just can‚Äôt believe he did that to me again. The lies, the 0 trust between us now. The nightmares I get from picturing his paralyzed face, the thought of him doing this to my and our daughter again. Idk if I can be with him anymore. I‚Äôve lived with an addict for 6 years. I know how hard he‚Äôs worked but idk if I can do this anymore. I even sent him numbers of multiple addiction counsellors during all this, I tried convincing him to go to therapy, I tried my best but he kept saying ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù.

Am I wrong to feel this way?",5

 Then a wild hair started thinking ukulele. Bought a cheap one from some quality dudes in Canada. Turns out cool when the fingers mushy from guitar the Uke is good for practicing rhythm. 

Now I want, Ukulele Hawaiian wood primo stuff.

I'm a freaking addict. This is a better addiction. Seems like a connection to some cosmic spirit could be in play.

I'm shattered. The Last I saw him was at my daughter's birthday party, he got so drunk he almost got into a fight and had to leave. I got him a ride 3times an he came back the 4th time I drove him out of the way and dropped him off. It was 4am I was livid he was outta his body/mind drunk. He was my friend of 20yrs we made up but I'm trying to change my attitude/control my emotions stop smoking/drinking so much. I feel like a complaining never changing burden on my friends sometimes so I didn't go over his house with my bad vibes. I know he was feeling bad too but I still stayed away... He called me mad as hell at this girl he was sleeping with(one of his neighbors), I was sleep when he called he was yelling I asked a question he yelled for me to shut the f****** so I hung up. After that we talked a few days later for about 5 minutes.

 Then about a week went by I called him no answer I text no reply. He's like that sometimes he doesn't believe in social media or being on the phone too much. He was a scholar he read a lot of books. The night of the 11th I started getting all these texts from mutual friends saying ""they heard about him and how sorry they were.""

I went to his apartment that night his neighbor said he died he was found in the girls apartment unresponsive 3 weeks ago. I went to his apartment the next day and it was all cleared out. I feel just awful for not being there for my friend when he needed me most. And I feel awful about the last time we saw each other. My best friend had sleeping problems. He would be up for 4 days smoking tobacco / weed drinking alcohol/beer.

 We've had many conversations in the past about getting closer to sobriety and counseling I know he was a grown man that ultimately would do what he wanted but I can't help but feel like if I had just came over he would still be here.",3

(must read post),"My parents feel super strongly that I had an awful kratom ""addiction"", but when I look at the difference between addiction and dependence my run with kratom seems much more like a dependence than an addiction. here is my argument

1. I continued to go to work / got great grades in school ( never could have done that if and when I was an ADDICT )
2. I was successfully saving my money / and  wasn't ever thinking about acquiring kratom/ how I would get money for it
3. I wasn't selling my stuff to afford kratom
4. I wasn't focusing any of my social life on kratom. I had all the same friends and have great friendships with all of them despite me using kratom and most of them didn't ever use kratom.
5. I have a very successful relationship that wasn't impacted by kratom (where as when I was actually ADDICTED to things in my past I couldn't do this, or many of the other things on this list)
6. It wasn't getting in the way of my life in any way. 
7. FINALLY the biggest one, I ended up having a seizure and nobody knows why but just in case it could have been because I was using kratom I completely stopped taking it no questions asked. ( I didn't continue to use the substance when something bad happened possibly from the substance) 

the only thing that I see that does fall into the category of addictive behavior was the fact that my tolerance would increase over time and I would continue to raise my dose to match my tolerance, but I could make the argument people who take medications that help them also have to do this and it's not an addictive behavior thing.   

I feel like it genuinely granted me a better lifestyle and kept me much soberer then I was before using the kratom without causing me to have the downsides of a true ADDICTION.",3

We were in an Air Force rescue raft bound for a sunken ship a few miles off the coast. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and dragged out to sea. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the splashing of a porpoise.. also a sickening odor like that of a dead fish. The noise got closer to the raft and it was then we heard a loud hissing sound.

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a long pole, about ten feet high, sticking straight up out of the water. On top was a bulb like structure. It appeared several more times, getting closer to the raft. The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. We panicked. All five of us put on our fins and went into the water.. 'Keep together and try for the ship!' I yelled.

After we were in the water, we became split up in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one. I got a closer look at the thing just before my last friend went under. The neck was about 12 feet long, brownish-green and smooth looking. The head was like that of a sea-turtle, except more elongated with teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a dorsal fin when it dove under for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were green with oval pupils.

I finally made it to the ship, the top of which protruded from the water, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I swam to shore and was found by the rescue unit. I know that thing was real because my friends are dead. My comrades were Eric Ruyle, Warren Salley, Larry Bill, and Bradford Rice. I live in Jacksonville now, but this happened when I lived in Fort Walton Beach. The encounter took place a few miles off the Pensacola coast. I spent a great deal of time at the Mental Health Resource Centre which is in Jacksonville. I also dealt with drug addiction and alcoholism due to the depression I've endured from people not believing me. I've had so many nervous breakdowns because I'm desperate for anyone to believe me that I've lost count. The Beany and Cecil cartoon finished airing in June of the year my friends were killed. I had a long lasting nervous breakdown that lasted for three months, until that godforsaken show finally met its end.

The world has some terrible secrets, and I know how she likes to keep them.. I have not seen the entity again  since what happened when I was a teenager.",2

Any advice regarding timing going from one to the other. Also, I failed to mention that it's subutex. 

I took sub and tex, whichever i could get, on and off for the past 2-3 years. Hell, i even mixed with opiates, many, many times and had no issues. 

But..lol. I got carried away one time and got into some h for about a month, decided I was done with that shit and made a plan to get back on sub the next morning. Suboxone, that is. 

At this point I was full blown, even doing a bump in the middle of the night, every night. 

Anyhow, wake up, 745 and take a quarter, 2mg. Go on about my day. 9am rolls around and I'm not feeling well. Called the plug, did a bump. And apparently that's where I really messed up. 

I had never heard of PWD. Holy shit. I had thoughts of doing bad things. I never want to go through that again. 

Come to find out that dope probably had fent in it, of course. 

Anyhow, I've only been doing 15mg roxy. Doing about 10/day for a couple months now. 

I'm ready to get back on the sub. But I wanted to start with the tex since it doesn't have the blocker in it to try to avoid PWD.

This is my first post on this sub, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I've been doing drugs since I was 16. At school I was depressed, so I began taking drugs in order to deal with life a little bit easier. It started with LSD and then moved to weed, xanax etc. My family has a history of drug abuse, some of my cousins are dealers, some are heavy weed smokers... 

Anyways, nowadays I mostly do benzos alongside with my antidepressants, as weed makes me anxious. This kinda worries me, because benzodiazepine long-term usage may cause alzheimers disease and a series of other illnesses.

I also have become increasingly addicted to the social media, and the pandemic is not helping. My college campus is still on lockdown (I live in Brazil) and I don't know when my presential classes will come back. Therefore I spend most of my days in front of a computer screen and have little social interaction offline. I find it very hard to focus on my studies.

I'm currently struggling with these addictions and some nasty self-esteem issues. Has any of you ever experienced something similar? I'm kinda lost and don't know what to do.

Best wishes,

&#x200B;

Dopamine is not a drug. Dopamine is not pleasure.

&#x200B;

Dopamine is the molecule of motivation.

&#x200B;

Without dopamine, you will lack the drive to do anything. You will literally lack the will to eat or even go to the bathroom to relieve yourself. You will die of starvation surrounded by food. This has been done with mice and they died before reaching 3 weeks of age.

&#x200B;

Without dopamine you die.

&#x200B;

Your brain secretes dopamine every time you do anything.

&#x200B;

When you get out of bed, it‚Äôs dopamine. When you check e-mail, it‚Äôs dopamine. When you look out the window, it‚Äôs dopamine. When you scratch an itch, it‚Äôs dopamine. When you run, it‚Äôs dopamine. When you eat a doughnut, it‚Äôs dopamine. When you read this, it‚Äôs dopamine.

&#x200B;

Dopamine amount varies

Everything we do is dopamine-fueled. But the amount of dopamine varies a lot.

&#x200B;

Walking releases less dopamine than sex. Scientists have measured the latter, and it increased dopamine 100% over baseline. Cocaine raises it 250%. Metamphetamine raises it about 1000%. That‚Äôs 10 times more than sex.

&#x200B;

This is obviously bad because methamphetamine, cocaine, alcohol and other substances that surge dopamine also have harmful health effects. But it‚Äôs even worse.

&#x200B;

Behaviours that spike dopamine are harmful because of the surgeitself separate from any other effects.

&#x200B;

Dopamine spikes create Dopamine Resistance

Why is it bad to have high dopamine spikes ? Because you will have less baseline dopamine. This translates into lower motivation and happiness.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

High dopamine spikes = dopamine resistance = low baseline dopamine = low happiness = low motivation = failure at everything

&#x200B;

When talking about dopamine, we need to distinguish between dopamine baseline and dopamine spikes.

&#x200B;

Baseline is the amount of dopamine you have in general.

&#x200B;

People with a high dopamine baseline are driven, they do a lot of things, are enthusiastic and full of energy. People with a low dopamine baseline are apathic, they don‚Äôt have the energy for anything, they are constantly distracted. Some of the difference is genetic, but most of it comes down to behaviour.

&#x200B;

Dopamine spikes are the increases in dopamine for activities. Sex doubles the dopamine level versus baseline for example (on average).

&#x200B;

It would appear that more and higher spikes are good. But the opposite is true.

&#x200B;

Your body is a dynamic adaptive system with limited resources.

&#x200B;

The body adapts to conditions, but it only produces a fixed amount of dopamine for each day. After each spike of dopamine, there is a subsequent drop in dopamine. After each high, there is a low.

&#x200B;

I remember when I ran my first ultramarathon. It was an enormous achievement for me at the time and a massive dopamine spike. After it, I was depressed for almost a week. This is the price for the dopamine increase during the event itself.

&#x200B;

But it does not take ultramarathons to create reductions in dopamine.

&#x200B;

Experiencing frequent, very high dopamine spikes produces not only temporary low points, it reduces the baseline level of dopamine.

&#x200B;

Let me repeat: high dopamine spikes reduce your baseline dopamine. You have developed dopamine resistance.

&#x200B;

To be clear, dopamine resistance is an expression. It is not a comprehensive and precise description of the cellular modifications, but a way to understand the whole process.

&#x200B;

Low baseline dopamine reduces your motivation to do anything. Anything, except seek other dopamine highs to compensate for your low.

&#x200B;

This is the core mechanism of addiction. Create unnaturally high dopamine spikes, which then depress baseline dopamine levels which gets the addict to seek more of the drug to feel ‚Äònormal‚Äô.

&#x200B;

It applies to any dopamine-spiking activity. And they stack together because they all influence the same pathway.

&#x200B;

A cocaine addict will have severely depressed baseline dopamine. He wants nothing except more cocaine because no other activity can provide enough dopamine for his dysfunctional system.

&#x200B;

Someone who spends a lot of time gaming, scrolling social media, chatting, responding to notifications, reading news, browsing with 20 tabs open, eating candy, eating junk food, is similar. He will also have a severely depressed dopamine baseline which will not provide enough motivation to pursue healthy activities. He will seek out the addictive ones repeatedly because his brain cannot provide the motivation for anything else.

&#x200B;

This dopamine cycle is vicious. It creates a feedback loop that feeds on itself.

&#x200B;

Like diabetics who become more insulin-resistant, if you have dopamine spikes, you become dopamine-resistance. This makes you seek out more dopamine spikes which create more dopamine-resistance

&#x200B;

The present world is full of unnaturally high dopamine triggers

We are at a unique point in history. Never before have there been so many dopamine-spiking moments for so many people.

&#x200B;

Why? Because we have created them.

&#x200B;

Most profit in the modern world comes from dopamine-spiking.

&#x200B;

Almost all packaged food and restaurant chains create dopamine spikes. Eating anything increases dopamine. Junk food overloads it. Any candy is a dopamine spike because sugar is so powerful in this regard. And so are ultra-processed food, combining simple carbs with fat. And so is the extraordinary convenience of food nowadays.

&#x200B;

The tech unicorns we praise are all build on dopamine spiking. Social media. Browsing itself. News. Convenience to do anything. Gaming. Porn. Easy shopping. Infinite potential sexual partners. The smartphone itself with its magical touchscreen.

&#x200B;

Shopping is a dopamine spike. We buy stuff for the dopamine-mediated pleasure we get when we swipe the card. You might never wear that dress, but you felt good in the moment when you bought it.

&#x200B;

Why do we have unnaturally high dopamine spikes now?

Dopamine is a survival and reproduction selection-mechanism. It has evolved to respond to stimuli in the natural world. For example this is why we have a dopamine spike when we eat sugar. It was super advantageous for our hunter-gatherer ancestors to gorge on it. It‚Äôs the same with getting social validation, finding new information, getting new objects, learning new patterns.

&#x200B;

Recently we have become extremely good at manipulating the dopamine mechanisms with supernormal stimuli. These are artificial stimuli which provide a greater dopamine spike than anything in the natural world.

&#x200B;

Supernormal stimuli create unnatural dopamine spikes which lead to dopamine-resistance.

&#x200B;

For example getting a thousand likes on Facebook is a supernormal stimulus. It is supercharged social validation. As is being good at a game on your mobile - supercharged pattern learning. As is eating a doughnut - supercharged feeding. As is opening a browser and reading news - supercharged information.

&#x200B;

They are so powerful, they turn us into addicts.

&#x200B;

There is no qualitative difference between overloading dopamine with cocaine or with gaming and social media.

&#x200B;

Sure, cocaine has other health effects and is more expensive. But in terms of how it destroys your baseline dopamine and thus your motivation to live life, they are the same.

&#x200B;

What to do

Avoid unnaturally high dopamine spikes (duh).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

No high dopamine spikes means you have high dopamine baseline.

&#x200B;

his in turn gives you motivation to do what you decide to do, instead of being the salve of your addictions.

&#x200B;

How do you identify dopamine spikes? In essence it‚Äôs anything that you feel compelled to do, and feel unpleasant if you don‚Äôt do. The most common nowadays are: gaming, social media scrolling and posting, chat, browsing news and the Internet in general without a specific purpose, porn, food, alcohol, cigarettes (including vaping), prescription drugs (big example: opioids), illegal drugs, checking email, shopping.

&#x200B;

How to untangle these addictions will be a separate post because there is a lot to dig into. The short version is:

&#x200B;

make the behaviour more difficult (e.g. put a long password on the Facebook app on your phone or uninstall it, don‚Äôt buy the cookies in the store),

&#x200B;

remove the trigger for that activity (e.g. no phone in the bathroom)

&#x200B;

find better replacements (e.g. when you feel the urge to scroll Instagram, read from a novel).

&#x200B;

Dopamine detox is a false but useful practice. It‚Äôs false because you can never avoid any dopamine spikes. That being said, it‚Äôs useful to avoid anything that provides high spikes (even naturally high) for a period of time to give your brain the opportunity to reset its dopamine baseline and tolerance. It‚Äôs basically enduring what you think is boredom for days or weeks (at least two weeks). It can work wonders (e.g. Dr. Huberman talks about how a two week no smartphone period cured a nephew‚Äôs gaming addiction).

&#x200B;

Afterwards you still have to control your lifestyle. You can easily fall back into dopamine resistance.

I have no urge to play it anymore.

Multiple times during conversations with friends I used to game with. They tell me shit like. ""You're gonna start again eventuallyüôÑ"" ""when you start again.... Let me know"" 

It was hard af for me to get better and when they say this it just crushes me. I'm afraid they'll call it an overreaction and that I need to chill out If I get called out and I say what's on my mind. Something like:

""Screw off.... I worked my butt off to quit and when you say that shit it's like your taking a piss on my efforts. You can spend the rest of your life on that shit but don't be dragging me down with you. If it was any other addiction and you said shit like that think of how inappropriate it would be. Maybe you don't but I have an issue with moderation and each time you say this shit it triggers me so do me a favour and never EVER say that again""",4

I don't want to give up but it's hurting me a lot,"Hey everyone, I hope you're all okay. I'll include a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I feel so selfish for even feeling this way. My (17F) boyfriend (19M) has been using drugs to cope for (I think) over 6 months now? Towards the end of last year, it got worse as he was dealing with a lot mentally due to losing a loved one right before Christmas. 

We went on a short break and started talking again as the new year came around, but things just feel so ...off? It's like he's not emotionally present anymore, and he doesn't really show affection which is starting to really hurt. Slow replies, and he's high basically all of the time. Even while he's at college, attending lectures. 

I'm afraid of bringing all of this up with him, since I know it's selfish of me to feel this way. I've always been understanding and I'm certainly not one to judge him for his addiction. But I don't actually know if his behaviour is a result of his addiction, which is why I thought to post here to hear from people who know more than me regarding his addiction. If it is, how can I support him?

I don't really want to just give up on him, but it's starting to really get to me. I don't think I'll be able to advise taking steps to recover from addiction, because the last time I brought it up, he got really mad at me. I understand that not wanting to recover is a valid choice too, but now I'm just really confused on how I should approach talking to him. I think he's also intimidated by such conversations, as he often struggles with putting his thoughts into words

I just don't know what to do. I don't know if I should tell him that he's hurting me because I don't want to suddenly accuse him of something when he probably doesn't even mean to 

TL;DR : My (17F) boyfriend (19M) has been dealing with a lot and is using drugs to cope. I wouldn't ever judge him for doing so, but he's not really present in our relationship the way he used to be. It hurts. How should I approach this situation?",4
2022-01-12 20:08:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/s2mc8j/from_the_daughters_perspective/,From the daughter's perspective,"My dad overdosed for the last time 2 1/2 months ago. He was just shy of turning 44. He dealt with a gripping addiction to meth for the past decade, and before that, it was mainly alcohol. It just progressed, and progressed, and he never could get better. He was always a little extreme.

I found out recently it was a fentanyl overdose. I wonder if he would still be alive if it wasn't laced, but he pushed his luck far and OD'd many times in the past few years, always bouncing back, always back to drugs. I knew it would happen at some point, and that broke me. It was hard to see him struggle, and I was often angry that he couldn't stop.

My youngest sibling is 11. I don't think he understands still, and I hope he is okay in the future and that he can process the loss of our father. He doesn't have a relationship with his mother, who was/is also an addict, so now he only has my grandmother whom he has lived with his entire life due to my dad's addiction. He (my dad) had a good heart, but chose to not use it for the right things or people. I hope my brother knows that.

I wish I would have been enough for him to get sober, his first born daughter. I feel bad for ever talking about him in a negative way. But he caused me a lot of pain throughout my life. I just wanted him to be able to be there for me, at least one day. I still don't understand addiction, or how it became so rampant in our society. I feel like everyone I know has been affected by this disease in some way. I am absolutely heartbroken and I really miss my father. He was very young still, and I wish he would have believed what he meant to all of us and that he was loved. He deserved a sober life.

If you are reading this, you are loved by someone. And it hurts them everyday to see you struggle. I hope you are doing okay. I always hoped my dad could make it to sobriety. Good luck to everyone, I am rooting for you, especially because I don't want any of your kids or family to hurt the way I am hurting. My heart is broken.",52

I'm starting to notice that one of my least favourite parts of being sober is the realisation that those old friends were only there because of the drugs. I don't know if I miss most of them personally, per-se, but I miss the company and the feeling of having a group of people I could hang out with, if that makes sense. I see one of them every once in a while in passing, and I miss that one friendship in particular that I had, but I know the reason she doesn't reach out is because I'm sober now. 
I get upset with myself for missing most of those people because of what our friendships were based on or around. I guess I am happy and have to be more grateful that the one really good friend I have now is worth more than most of the old ones combined...

So at the beginning of a meeting, I‚Äôm sure most are familiar with having to stand up and introduce yourself to everyone else on the meeting.

‚ÄúHi, My name is Dak and I‚Äôm an addict.‚Äù

What I‚Äôve come to find out after years of saying that phrase is the fact that I was attaching a negative affirmation which essentially became part of my identity. So when things would go wrong and the going got tough, I would always turn to wanting to use because hey, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an addict.‚Äù Right?

After a ton of reading, talks with my best friend, and lots of reflection, I decided to always instead say, ‚ÄúMy name is Dak, and I‚Äôm going to change the world.‚Äù

So what happened since? 

In the year and a half I‚Äôve practiced this, it excites me to tell everyone here that this phrase has changed my life!

I‚Äôm happier, I‚Äôm loved by everyone at work, I‚Äôve learned how to overcome anxiety, I‚Äôm confident, and most of all, excited about life and the daily challenges I get the opportunity to take on with it. 

Do I think it‚Äôs really because of the phrase? Absolutely. The best part? Getting to live life actually believing it. And for those asking how I plan on doing it? 

Simple. The answer is -  One life at a time. üôÇ

So the next time you are faced with something that makes you want to use. Try this out, and see how this simple life changing tool can change your life for the better too.

I‚Äôll start with what I‚Äôm aware of. I‚Äôm 22 years old currently living with my single dad who is 40 until me and my girl can get an apartment. My Mom and him divorced when I was 2, and ever since then he‚Äôs been addicted to meth and heroin. He has since come off of it, and has been clean for a couple of years now. However, he has since replaced it with Xanax. At first it started out as a doctors prescription because of his awful anxiety and his PTSD from doing some awful gang affiliated actions. (He helped dispose of a body that a gang killed out of fear he‚Äôd get shot too). Everyone in the family is aware of his illegal activities and thank god he never got sent to prison. Because of that, he has nightmares at night nearly all the time and claims that his Xanax is not only for his anixety, but to help him sleep, cope with his drug withdrawals, and not have nightmares. 

But he‚Äôs addicted. He has stopped going to the doctor because he can‚Äôt afford it, apparently. So he buys it off the street. I‚Äôm aware that he snorts it so to enter his bloodstream faster, and I‚Äôm also aware he takes more than he should. His excuse is that he‚Äôs developed a tolerance so he takes more to help him. But the fact is, he‚Äôs blatantly reliant on it and you can tell when he‚Äôs taken it. He acts extremely manic. He claims it helps him sleep when in reality he doesn‚Äôt go to bed until 2 in the fucking morning, and falls in and out of sleep every 30 minutes. He comes in the kitchen randomly to cook, and is just‚Ä¶not himself. It‚Äôs honestly hard to explain. It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs drunk. But without the slurring and drowsiness. 

I‚Äôm honestly sick of it. I don‚Äôt doubt he suffers from mental health problems, but his addiction to Xanax, which in itself stems from previous drug habits, has got to stop. He needs to be on actual medication and something that he can‚Äôt get addicted to. Let alone, PRESCRIBED. There‚Äôs nothing else that needs to be said there. He can‚Äôt take addictive substances. He just simply can‚Äôt control himself. I want him to get better. I want him to function. But not off of an addictive drug that he feels he is reliant on for basically the rest of his life. It is his actions why I haven‚Äôt touched a single drug besides weed for my entire life. I want to help, but have no idea how. If you confront him about it, he gets extremely upset and defensive. He does not like admitting his flaws. I can‚Äôt force him to take rehab and therapy, but god is there anything I could do? 

Help would be appreciated.

Edit: He‚Äôs wide awake and it‚Äôs 1:30, doing god knows what. Ugh.",8

I'm really scared and desperate. If someone reads it and finds it in themselves to say there's any hope for me, I'd be so grateful. I have lost all hope.

Mental problems had come before I got myself into alcohol and drugs - traumatizing childhood, I guess. Started cutting myself when I was a teenager.

Some years later finally went to a psychatrist, got diagnosed with depression, tried to put me on meds, didn't help. In hindsight, I understand that that most probably wasn't depression but some sort of severe anxiety disorder. 
Some time after that I tried stimulants for the first time and my life has never been the same.

Two years ago I detoxed from a year of abusing street amphetamine, half a year of 5 gpd phenibut while being on antidepressants that whole time. Quitting speed was easy for me since I kept taking phenibut, but when wds, tolerance and horrific nightmares started hitting me, I had no other choice but to check myself into a hospital. 

A month after went to a rehab bc I had awful PAWDS, severe depression and couldn't function at all. Also developed an eating disorder.

Staying clean and getting both medical and psychological (although the latter, as I see now, was very dubious) treatment in rehab somewhat helped, I managed to stay relatively stable, even content sometimes - but in a month after checking out from 8 month long rehab I spiralled into one of the worst depressive episodes of my life and tried to kill myself. Spent a week in an ICU, then 3 weeks in a psych ward. 

Didn't help, I came home just as debilitatingly depressed and wishing I would have finished what I had started. Shortly after I found out that I was 6 weeks pregnant and also covid positive. The toxicosis, the fever, the excrutiating emotional pain and stress were so big that only recently have I begun to process it. Back then I just wanted it all to end, I wanted to die.

The stage of pregnancy was way too serious, I had to have an abortion asap. I know it sounds like a complete asshole move but we went to an abortion clinic never mentioning that a had corona. 

After I recovered from covid I ended up back in rehab, where my mentors and doctors kept me for 5 more months trying to adjust my meds. In april last year I came home feeling way better, half in remission from my depression. Things were finally lighting up. 

A couple of months after returning from rehab everything went down again. I started oversleeping, rarely left the apartment, and oh god - that dreadful thing, anhedonia, hit me again.

Then the worst happened. Me and my 3 year bf broke up. He couldn't take my struggles anymore, couldn't watch me suffer. That was it. I relapsed after 1,5 years of being clean.

It was a one time thing though, a couple of days of phenibut, methedrone and speed binge. My mother checked me into the worst shithole of a mental hospital, and disowned me for relapsing. The anhedonia, the despair, the fatigue, the loneliness, the sadness - the depression - were unbeatable. One of the docs I know well suspected therapy resistance long before that, but after a month of being heavily drugged with some serious antidepressants and antipsychotics nothing changed. Since then it's been an endless chain of everyday crying, boredom, loneliness, feelings of guilt and shame. 

I started on prozac and gabapentin in the beginng of October. Somehow it did break my resistance, but also gave me such godawful anxiety that I, being a drug addict that I am, thought of nothing better than abuse gabapentin to get some relief. I got so suicadal that my ex-bf checked me into a psych ward again. They got me off gabapentin, and my prozac dosage to the maximum. I didn't think it could get worse from there, but it did.

I slept for 15 hours a day. I never got up, smoking cigs in bed. I couldn't make food, I couldn't take my ass to shower even if my life depended on it. I cried a lot. I felt abandoned and alone. I decided to kill myself before the year ended.

After 3 weeks of this torture I found the strength in me to go to the pharmacy and bought a box of gababentin. It was the middle of November. I have been abusing drugs daily ever since. 

For the last 1,5 months I've been on 2,5 gpd of phenibut, the last two weeks - ~4g, the last several days - 5g. The first month was good. Anhedonia went away. I felt more energy, left the house sometimes. Started watching youtube, drawing again. The excruciating feelings of guilt, regret, shame and abandonment subsided. I got my long lost sexual drive back. Fatigue was significantly less crippling. 4 weeks ago I quit prozac.

I know I fucked up. I should have never stopped looking for a good psychatrist and stick to the official meds instead of drugging myself up in an attempt of self-treatment. And now things are getting out of hand again.

I sleep 5-6 hours a day sometimes, waking up in cold sweat every hour. I have horrific nightmares where all my trauma and subconcious fears haunt me. When I finally wake up, I feel everything I've been running from 10x stronger, especially anhedonia, guilt, regret and fear of abandonment. I immediatly take 2,5g to calm down and be able to function a little, but still I spend all day in bed on my phone with a ceaseless headache. I feel ok for the day, but I know it's going to get worse in a matter of days.

A doctor I know well and who is my last hope is seeing me on Friday, I couldn't get an appointment earlier. And God knows how long before I get hospitalised. 

I'm running out of stock and all the pharmacies around know me and my script is expiring. I don't know what to do. 

I can't quit phenibut ct, it will literally kill me. Should I check myself into a private psychiatric clinic asap, should I switch to something else, should I just keep taking my dosage without raising it?

Do I actually have a chance of ever getting back to normal life? I've tried every antidepressant out there, and the last one nearly drove me to kill myself and crippled me. I know it's all my fault. 

I was suggested ECT. Is this going to help? I'm ready for anything. 

I know getting back on drugs was utterly stupid. But I couldn't take it anymore. 

I am scared shitless.
Please somebody tell me there is hope.",6

There were pregnancy tests in the girls rest rooms toilets, coke bags On the locker room floors, We drank tequila out of water bottles , Kids has sex in the auditorium or the dugout on the baseball field, teachers has sexual relations with students , I literally got my nipples pierced in the school bathroom when i was 16, athletes were invincible when it came to Sexual assault and abuse, Guy would die for you to get too drunk at a party so they can ‚Äútake you home‚Äù‚Ä¶ , Girls getting laced or drugged for sex, Child porn basically going around because guys would ‚Äú expose ‚Äú girls who trusted them enough to send pictures to, even other girls would part take in the exposing for shits and giggles . Euphoria high isn‚Äôt a drastic Assumption of what goes on in high school. people need to be more aware of what kids are having accessible to them. Any drug i wanted was just a text away people would deal pills in between classes. for fucks sake and the adults only cared if our shoulders were showing or if were texting in classs lol",7

We never got along in school, in fact he used to bully me along with his mates, but that was so many years ago and we had both changed so much that we hit it off and spoke about it and I forgave him. He wasn't going through the best of times back then and his own ""friends"" weren't real friends, he only did it to fit in. It took a lot for me to let go of all that and move on, but I'd lived in anger and resentment of my bullied from way back for too long, and I was happy with who I was then (and now) and let it all go. We became really close.

He admitted to me he went through coke addiction really bad, almost died. He'd made a mess of his life but was getting things back on track. He was at University doing a course to become a paramedic and he was doing great. Things started to slip as the months went on, however, and his behaviour became erratic. I knew this all too well because I too struggled with addiction whilst at University, albiet not to coke but to other things. I really tried to be there for him, I took the brunt of his mood swings and his anger and without pushing him to admit that he'd clearly been using again, I was just there for him. 

It became noticeable that he was drinking on the job. He smelt of booze all the time, he went off on his own on his breaks and came back stumbling and slurring his words. I saw him drinking at the bus stop before work, as well as after work. Sometimes we walked back together and before I realised he had a drink problem we often had a drink together, too. His moods became more frequent, he was missing work and coming in late, and hammered. He'd been in fights, and eventually got kicked out of uni, which made him fall further.

He came to mine one day in a state, started snorting on my table and offered me some- which I was sort of frustrated about because he knew my past, and putting temptation in my way I felt was wrong, but he clearly wasn't thinking straight. But this kept happening. He'd come out with me and my friends and get so drunk he'd make a fool of himself, then he kept offering me drugs and it all became too much. I started distancing myself from him because he was a reminder of the things I once was. It was difficult to see him like this, as I said we had become really close and there was one point I was heading for a mini breakdown at work and went to hand in my resignation but he sat with me whilst I was in the midst of a panic attack and stopped me from making a rash decision. That was the guy I remembered from when we started working together, the good guy, the rational one with good advice and a kind heart. He really helped me that day and I was on the brink of some kind of mental break or at least relapse that day.

But he got worse again, and eventually he got so bad that it was clear for the entire of the workforce to see, that he was drunk, and high, and the higher ups had had enough. After a massive argument he had with the boss one day, and after telling me he wasn't drinking (i'd seen him down a can of beer at work just an hour before), it was clear he wasn't going to last. Little after that they ended his contract. We stayed in touch and I tried talking to him about it, but he wasn't ready to listen.

Until one day, when he invited me round his, and I was very skeptical. Every friday he would be drunk and high and try ringing everybody, including myself, and I would always make an excuse not to be there, because it was too hard. But this time, he sounded so down and desperate that I agreed to meet him at his house. This was difficult for me to do because of all the times he would show no regard to my own struggles and use in front of me, but I did it anyway. Once I got there I could already smell the booze on him, half an empty whiskey bottle on the table. We went to the store and he bought a crate of beers. He told me he hadn't used in weeks, but a couple of hours in, he was running upstairs to get his stash out and once again using in front of me, asking me if I wanted any. I refused, but I was afraid to talk to him about his problem in case he lashed out at me, as he had done before, and we were alone in his house pretty far from where I lived. 

He told me something that to him was a massive deal, a big dark secret he was afraid to tell. I won't go into it, but I listened to him, I was there for him, I offered advice and a lot of what he told me gave me reason to hope- if this was the reason he was so down, and was using so much and drinking so much, maybe he could come to terms with it and stop. I was too optimistic. I spent hours with him, talking through this thing he'd told me, telling him he was overthinking and that it wasn't so bad. He seemed to be really taking it in. I felt so happy because he had admitted to me he had been drinking at work, something he'd flat out refused back then. He admitted he was falling down the rabbit hole again and wanted to stop. We talked and talked and he told me everything he'd been holding in for so long. I'd gotten through to him. I can't explain how awkward some of what he'd told me was, because it involved people I knew also, and I had to come to terms with it myself- and it has affected me to this day. But at the time all I could think about what how he'd opened up and that this wasn't about me, this was one step closer to recovery.

The next day he told me to forget all about it. Said he was confused and said things he didn't mean and all the stuff he told me was the result of being high and drunk. He said he was going to stop drinking, stop using- the usual. He'd basically thrown all those hours of talk and advice back in my face. He almost told me to keep my nose out- and so I decided that's what I'd do. Too many times have I been there, trying to help him be open and be himself and talk and admit he has a problem. He finally does, and changes his mind. I've heard it before, and I don't want to hear it again. 

I didn't completely write him off, but when he was clearly drunk texting again the following week, I knew nothing was going to change. You have to be willing to do the foot work yourself before anyone else can help you, I know that more than most... so I stopped talking to him. The last messages were of him telling me he meant nothing of what he said and that he was just making stuff up. I know that was not true, but I was sick of this yo yo routine. It was affecting my mental health as much as his. I can't help feeling as though I gave up on him too soon. 

Should I have kept in contact? Was it wrong of me to move on? It's been playing on my mind and I keep wondering if I should check up on him. He's not on social media so I can't see if he's around and it sometimes worries me that he will get worse without a positive influence in his life. His current friends seem to encourage his behaviour and binges and I know how it feels. Any advice would be great, thanks!",3

For the last 6th months I had no idea. Until one night he got the new Xbox and he passed out and knocked it over I knew he wasn‚Äôt ok. ( I know it sounds shitty that I didn‚Äôt realize but I am in college and working full time at this point). (Plus the next Xbox had just released s he had pointed out many times that no one had this console yet).  He was gasping for air (he lived with his parents) so I ran up and told his parents he was not ok. They asked what he took and I honestly didn‚Äôt know (bad move apparently). He got taken to the hospital and was in the psych ward for a few days. (Not the first time unfortunately)I picked him up from the psychiatric facility. 3 weeks later his parents are calling me to check in on him. I had given him The ultimatum that if he didn‚Äôt get sober I was leaving him. I would wake up in the middle of the night and he would be gone. (I was stupid enough. To think nothing of it) Anyways when I would get off of work I would ask him if he want to go to Arby‚Äôs and we would go to Arby‚Äôs and then he wouldn‚Äôt have enough money to pay for it even though he had said he had $2000 a day before. I would end up paying and asking where his money went. Turn out he was buying drugs and guns. Long story short one night his parents kicked him out. I was unaware of this. His parents were texting me to go check on him and I could tell he was fucked up because he wasn‚Äôt making any sense. He told me his parents bought him a hotel (which made no sense since I noticed he was so fucked up that day( pls on top of that I didn‚Äôt know he had a problem with drugs that seriously ). So I go to meet him in the hotel and he hadent even checked in because he didn‚Äôt have his drivers licenses. So I end up putting the hotel under my name even though I‚Äôm only 20 years old they let me because they could see I was having a panic attack. Anyways he started showing me all this stuff he had stolen. I was scared to do anything because of that point I knew he had at least 50 Xanax on him & I knew he could overdose ( so I thought apparently I take  about 120 Xanax to overdose unless they are lased with fentanyl). Anyways he ended up overdosing in the room under my name with a bunch of stolen goods and his parents ended up sending him to rehab and he begged for me back for about six months and I finally decided to get back with him after six months of him being in Aa. Fast forward to a year of him being in Aa , he‚Äôs not even texting me every day, talking about girls in his rehab, and I‚Äôve been pregnant with his child three times now and I‚Äôve had to pay for the abortion, and he has not seem to have given one shit because his parents are paying for him to live in a nice ass condo in Florida while he goes to rehab and he will never have to work in his day in his life and it honestly makes me upset because he text me to this day like nothing happened and the trauma I have been through I‚Äôve been in counseling since he overdosed the last time and I took him to the hospital. It‚Äôs just so hard for me and he seems to be doing fine. He begged me to move down to the condo in Florida but I am still in college and would like to finish college in state so that I don‚Äôt have to pay the fees of out of state. To this day he still sends me pictures of the cat we got together but acts like it‚Äôs no big deal. I went to visit him a few times before we broke up.

If I sound like you at all, please let me know how your life turned out. I am afraid of what could be mine, but hope it ends up bright.

I am 20 now.

I started vaping when I was 16. I could not get enough. I had a vape for my bag, my car, and my bedroom. My parents would do everything to stop me when they caught me- hours were spend yelling, grounding, and disabling access to the things I enjoyed. I knew who would get me nicotine, and would go get another just as quickly as one got taken away. I quit 4 months ago after actively attempting to quit for 2 years.

I have had severe OCD since the age of 5. I tend to obsess. My compulsions do not drive my behaviors that I am aware of thus far.

My cousin was an addict. To everything I might add. It started as prescription opioids. From there he quit pro golf, lost everything to his battle, and soon overdosed multiple times on heroin. He passed away at the age of 27. It was an accident at work, my family believed he was sober at the time, but they did not do toxicology with the autopsy as I believe they are afraid of what they would find out.

I had a severe eating disorder. Put myself in the hospital after my heart rate went into the 20s. I was so damn good at starving myself. Even the doctors said it was incredible how much I was capable of committing to my disorder and the subsequent damage I caused in such a short time. Recovered now.

My latest problem seems to be drinking.  I do not drink often, because I did enough of that in high school. I would frequent the liquor store before I was 18. I did the usual weekend partying. Now, I am afraid of myself when I drink. 1 in every 5 times I drink I'd say I fuck up. Last night I blacked out and texted 3 of my exes. I think I also admitted to my best friend of sleeping with a fling of hers during another one of my poor decision moments. I am not sure of anything that I said, as I do not remember the last 3 hours of the evening. I allegedly fell down the stairs. Last month I woke up in the bed of a frat house totally naked, but could not remember if anything happened. Turns out it did. And I made the first move. And we talked for hours about our lives, everyone said I looked totally fine, and in the end I  do not even remember anything beyond my 4th or 5th drink.

Please me honest. Should I be scared for myself and my future?",2

After their last visit my partner and I finally saw the signs and talked to each other about it. It's alarming how quickly they go through substances. I'll take one or two puffs off a vape over the course of a couple hours and meanwhile they are hitting the bong every 30 seconds continuously until their entire supply is gone. I'll drink a glass of wine or two throughout the evening and they finish off 3 bottles in the same amount of time. We asked them not to drink too much of the gin because that's what my partner likes and the next morning we found like 1 shot left in the bottle. After we get tired and head off to bed they will stay up drinking alone. They came downstairs late one morning with the remainder of a bottle and a glass that they brought to their room the night before.

They also randomly make statements about their drinking/smoking saying that they have such a high tolerance and need to imbibe a lot. They also talk about how they need to be careful because their parent was an alcoholic. 

This friend is coming to stay with us again next weekend while they are in town and we are seriously considering just boxing up all the booze. But that led to obvious questions... how do we explain that? What if they just go buy their own booze? Should we say something to them?

I have no idea how to handle this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1

He always wanted to help people. We live 2 hours from new orleans and when Katrina hit, he took in 15 people into his house and fully took care of them until they were back on their feet. He was dealt a shitty hand as a kid including his brother taking his life when he was 17, my dad was 10 and heard the shot in the house. My dad struggled with alcohol and drugs. But he was known as a functioning addict. Had a career. Nice things. Didn't look like he was on anything ever. 2 years ago he befriended this girl who's my age (26). She was a heroin addict. Terrible person. But my dad wanted to help. He also was sexually involved which I know clouded his judgment with her. We all told him we didn't like her and she felt off to us. He then saw her in private. He knew tho. He told multiple people including my aunt that if anything happened to him and she was around, she did it. My dad was found in a motel, dead. She was there. High. My dad and I were really open with each other. I know he liked meth. I also know he's done drugs all his life and knew his limits. People who knew him knew he didn't do heroin. The story she told police was all a lie and could've been proven EASILY but unfortunately the cops and EMTs saw it was an OD and left it at that. He had meth and a very large amount of heroin in his system. She waited 30 minutes to call cops. This happened after she called her mom and a friend to clean up the room and plant the drugs in his truck. EMT got there. Performed 15 minutes of cpr and got him back. Unfortunately he was brain dead. Doctors tried everything but on September 14th, 2020 at 3:49 pm. We lost him forever. The town they lived in was small and everyone knows everyone. She was heard going around laughing saying how she took care of him and got revenge on him for trying to help her. She was also seen with his belongings and stole alot of money out of his truck. She died a few months later. Heroin OD. Trust your gut about people. Please. And if you know someone who has an addiction, help them and don't stop trying. My dad was the first person I ever lost and I am broken from it. The regrets I have pile up everyday still.",36

To stop cocaine, I have to stop alcohol, I don't know if this is going to be easy since all my friends drink AND THE F* PROBLEM IS ME, not them... Alcohol is the main and only trigger... I have to reinvent life... So fucking lost
Should I seek new friends? Is it time for NA? I had a xanax to calm myself  down and rest, I know tomorrow I will regret everything I did last night and I will probably feel confident about not doing it again... But then... The weekend comes...

I feel like she runs with it as a series of starting and stopping failures, where she has to power through her addiction all the time or else she's failed and has wasted the time she was sober. Like if she's sober a week and drinks then that week is now worthless.

I already knew how addictive this shit would be so I used it with caution. Before ritalin I was drinking more than three cups of coffee just to regain my comprehension skills.

After taking my first dose I could easily sleep. And when I asked my pharmacy about it he recommended me to get higher dose so I did. I never took it on daily cycles. I can say I took it 3 days a week by 2 or 3 doses each.

Now, I cant focus without it. I tried to withdraw form it several times, but I had to reuse it to become productive. I can't stand people anymore. My libido is nonexistent most of time when I'm sober. I am planning to speak about it with my psychiatrist as soon as possible.

I underestimated how addictive it could be",1

I think I have a problem with molly,"Hello all, Six months ago i found out that ex of 8 years cheated on me and we broke up. We worked together and she started dating the guy she cheated with. An basically made my job a living hell and embarrassed me. Every one knew I loved her and we were together for so long. Then the next day everyone knew we broke up and I was sitting there looking stupid.
This is where you guys come in.  About a year we tryed molly together. It was fun. Sex was fun. So we got more and did it when we went to the bar or clubbing. Then we realized we can use it to help give us energy to work our 13 hour shifts when we were drained. And after a while they became common. We took breaks here and there but we were alwase careful. Except I wasn't. It was slow, I'd buy a few extra here and there. Mabye take another one when we would go out. After a while I was full on hiding the extra ones I took. But Iv alwase been good at hiding it. Because i needed to hide it from her. It kept me in check in a way.
. 
Then 2 months ago she moved out. That check and balances was gone and the i was full on dippressed and using these as a way to cope. After a little ofcorse I started taking more and more. Now sometimes when I take them my mind gets a little fuzzy, my emotions are harder to control and I have a harder time putting conversations together. My family already worries about how sad I am and how hard the break up is. I can't worry them. She was my bestfriend for 8 years so there's not many people I can fall back on. I can't ask for help cause everyone will freak out and treat me with more pitty then they already do.

I am a dual-diagnosis alcoholic in recovery and happen to be taking a college psychology course on addiction and recovery. One of the assignments is to attend three separate addiction meetings (whether that be AA, NA, SMART recovery, etc.). As a person who attends multiple group meetings weekly, I find this assignment offensive. I think that it is slightly exploitative and voyeuristic to require this. I have done the research and, according to the websites, students are often allowed to attend open meetings. I am wondering if anyone else would feel *uncomfortable* if students came to observe their meetings?

i‚Äôm a 22 year old female whose been with her partner (male 26) for 4 years. I met him shortly after my first long term relationship abruptly ended (he passed away from an OD). My partner has always been my best friend up until the last 2 years where we have done nothing but argue almost daily, over the same thing. his actions.
i suppose if you‚Äôve read this far, him and i are engaged and haven‚Äôt started planning in 3 years due to his actions and finical restrictions caused by his actions/choices. He also has struggled with addiction but upon agreeing to marry him he had finished months of rehab, etc and was sober for a year and planned on staying that way. we bought our home together and adopted 2 dogs and i thought we had everything we wanted especially at such a young age. shortly after moving in things became ugly fast.
my partner began using coke again, spending extreme amounts of money (3k in a little over a 2 month span and much more over the coming months/years). if he wasn‚Äôt using he was drinking, going on venders not coming home etc, totaling his car, letting our bills fall behind, mistreating me verbally etc. 
i‚Äôve tried for months to help, suggested rehab, meetings everything. i‚Äôve tried tough love, being sympathetic everything but at this point i‚Äôve lost sympathy. i‚Äôve drained my savings helping him out of shitty situations, coving his bills and mine etc and i‚Äôm just exhausted. i have my past trauma of an abusive childhood etc and have BPD myself and trouble handling my emotions, but i feel like every slip up he has sends me into another spiraling range or depression. 
things between us have gotten physical while arguing horrible things have been said that i‚Äôm not sure we can come back from. it seems like we‚Äôll have a week full of love and happiness and he slips up again and it‚Äôs back to a month of hating each other and fighting endlessly. 
He is the bread winner, and i don‚Äôt have family or friends to stay with or to leave nonetheless take my dogs with. living on my own i would simply not survive. i‚Äôm not sure if this is worth fighting for, i still love him regardless of EVERYTHING i know he loves me too but i just don‚Äôt understand how he could possibly love me and continue to destroy our family. i know addiction is a disease, and this isn‚Äôt him so i‚Äôm fighting to help him and to have the life we want but i don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll ever get better, or if this will be a life of misery and battles for me. i‚Äôm young, and i want a life with him, just not like this

so i guess my question is, am i beating a dead horse or do i stay and help him? how do i help him? i just don‚Äôt know what the best course is with an addict. also, i‚Äôve never been a user, i‚Äôve always been a straight square but somehow have dated plenty of men with addiction issues‚Ä¶ i truly do love this person and want nothing but the best for him and our relationship but am i enabling by staying? i just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong. it‚Äôs easier to just say ‚Äúwell leave him duh!‚Äù than to actually do it, there is so much attached to this relationship and it just shatters me to let it all go because of his addiction but i‚Äôve never been in this position i don‚Äôt know, i‚Äôm torn. 

i also hope i‚Äôm posting in the right category and don‚Äôt offend or hurt and anymore this is really just me asking for advice and some outside feedback‚Ä¶ :/",5

2022-01-06 21:19:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rxvyl0/without_my_addictions_i_would_kill_myself/,Without my addictions I would kill myself,"It sounds so dramatic, but it's true. To put it simply, I'm depressed. I've always been depressed. Even as a kid, I would cry all the time, had no friends, and was an insomniac who took two hours to fall asleep. I had suicidal thoughts before I even hit puberty. Being depressed, even suicidally depressed, is normal to me.

I'm on antidepressants and they help me with energy and make me able to carry out day-to-day tasks, which is great, but it still obviously hasn't fixed me. I'm a polyaddict and I'm bulimic. 

I love drugs. I've always loved drugs. They soften everything up, make life seem... okay. Manageable. I'm very selective in what drugs I use and where, which is probably better than going batshit. I can handle the negative side effects pretty well, have never had any kind of major incident due to drug use. I fuck with street pills, which is obviously living on the edge, but I don't care, I've never cared...

And then there's the bulimia, which in all honesty is worse than the drugs. I am 100% addicted to food. Stuffing myself with thousands of calories is the only thing that fills the gaping void inside of me. Throwing it up and having a flat stomach and feeling like I got *away* with it all. I always overate as a (depressed) kid so the addiction runs incredibly deep. If I had to give an average number I'm bingeing and purging twice a day, which isn't the craziest thing ever but it's definitely not healthy.

These addictions are my only real teather to the world. If I suddenly lost them... I don't know what I'd do with myself. I'd probably kill myself. 

Thing is, *I have a good life.* I'm making the dean's list, I have a good relationship with my family, I've never gone hungry or had to really go without. But for some reason, it's not enough. It's never enough.

And I can't get help, not really. Any time I've tried to open up to anyone, even a therapist, I just *can't*. My chest tightens up and my hands start shaking and I feel sick so I wind up spitting out a fraction of the truth at best.

I want to die. I want it to be over. I don't have the drive to do anything about it, so I just slowly kill myself instead. I have no plans to make it to 30, and if I'm still here, fuck. I may have to do something that matters. (I'm not in crisis currently, please don't call 911 on me).

But I'm not dumb. I know my problem is simply that I can't fucking cope with *anything*. I can't cope with school, can't cope with work, can't cope with romance, can't cope with disappointment, can't cope with finances, can't cope with other people, can't cope with myself. I've never been able to cope.

Ive finally gotten her to counseling to help with her mental health...See she suffered with addiction as well.
If anyone else had hurt my wife they way he has theyd most likely have ceased to draw breath...but this is my wifes lil boy and Im in a position where I can do nothing about that.
Now I'm not totally heartless. I'll give anyone a chance to turn their shit around...I'll even provide the tools to help if I can until Insee youre just wasting my time...but anyway...that brings us to the point of this post. Would anyone who has been through it..dealt with it...come out of it..even still struggling with it....be willing to correspond with him..I think he needs to here from people who can relate...I have no where to come from to offer advice...Ive done plenty of drugs but was probably to cowardly to get addicted...I saw the hold drugs started to get in me and it scared the hell outta me and I quit...didnt have the balls to stay  with it...So I can only mildly relate to what he's been through.
Also if there are any good books I could send to him. I'd be willibg to pay for those and send them to him...like I said I'll try an provide the tools. I will say anything coming from a point of christianity will be immediately discounted by him and given my own religious views I won't push that on him. I do appreciate anyone willing to help.",4

My behavior of choice is video games (though, I can easily fall into shopping as well if I don't keep a tight rein on myself). 

I only came to this conclusion completely a few days ago. I spend all my time gaming. When I'm not gaming I'm thinking about gaming. I'm not really missing out on anything because I have few to no other interests or social activities. Friends? They all game too. If there is something I can put off I will do it. When things go badly (I lose a game, I play poorly, etc), then I turn to self-injury to outlet my anger and, I guess, fear. Why fear? Because gaming *is my future career.* It's me.

I can't quit. I'm not ready to be that extreme. If I do, I lose that career. I lose a major passion. No problem, I told myself, I can limit my time if I try really hard. Hahahaha... I can't. I said that I'd take a break an hour to 1.5 hours in. I got to that point and didn't. I recognised that I said that, and it was time, and I kept going anyway. I was maybe 3-4 hours deep by the time I got up and that was only because I needed a drink. I have no self-control. 
I've tried to see a psychiatrist, but I can't find any, and the ones who I did find don't respond. Day 1 and I've already lost. GG, I guess. 

Any advice here? The time limit apps never work for me. How do I balance my need to play and my complete dependence on it? Is that even possible?",7

Previous to my arrival i was a pretty horrible drug addict. like most drug addicts i was in denial of my issue and the ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù i was doing was no longer occasional. Since i was and still am a minor i was living under my parents roof. my addiction became hard to hide when my now ex girlfriend totaled her car in a bad accident, after spending the entire night with me car hopping, taking xanax, drinking, and coke. we had both had drinking and xanax issues for a while and situations like these were normal. When my gf was in the hospital obviously my parents found out and around a months later the day went to wilderness rolled around. 

As expected i freaked the fuck out and my first weeks were miserable, didn‚Äôt obey anyone and rebelled. i never attempted to run though, because i had heard about wilderness programs before and knew it wouldn‚Äôt work.  I guess most wilderness therapy‚Äôs focus on spirituality and weird hippie shit, but this place took it pretty far tbh. lot of the practices are just stolen from native american culture ig. we would have our ‚Äúexpositions‚Äù for like 5 days out of the week where we would hike all around utah and colorado and set up camp. everything we owned we had to tied up in a tarp with seatbelts and wear as a backpack during multi mile, high  elevation hikes. The other days of the week we would be on ‚Äúbase‚Äù where we just worked around the place and did chores.  we showered by pouring home depot buckets of water on ourselves. as time went on obviously i adapted and wasnt pouting around, i committed whether it made me hate my life or not. The hikes and lack of food were the only things that would break me, wearing a big ass bag hiking up a mountain in the dumping rain isn‚Äôt fun. the amount of times i ate shit and was forced to just continue hiking if i destroyed my ankle. when we would arrive at camp after hiking all day we‚Äôd set up shelter with a tarp and rocks and then prepared to cook all organic  dinner for the entire team ( around 10 boys and 3 guides).  We we‚Äôre also issued our ‚Äúpersonal food‚Äù which is just shitty peanut butter and oats and random things. when this food would rot, we were sometimes forced to eat it anyway in order to get any new food at ALL. I felt hungry 2/3 that entire experience. 

Although this entire thing has just been me shitting on it, i realized while i was there i was way happier than i was on drugs which of course made me want to stay sober when i got out. We had to tell our parents everything bad we‚Äôve done and all that. I became pretty committed. i was thankful enough to not go to another treatment center or ‚Äúafter care‚Äù after i left wilderness after around 3 months and 2 weeks.  

I am now at home and i look back on the pictures and cry sometimes because i believe i was manipulated into being happy in a way.  being starved and forced to do those things made me miserable but i see myself smile in all of those pictures.   Please ask me anything thanks for listening to me vent lol",1

Serenity Prayer

Hi, my name is Kerry, and I‚Äôm an addict.
An alcoholic sometimes when I slip back into old habits.
Too much of anything is unhealthy; 
I‚Äôve never been good at balancing.

Addicted to toxicity,
It‚Äôs so distracting; the focus is off me.
Nothing seems real, 
And I love how that feels.

I find comfort in the hurting, 
My drug of choice is whatever is the most capturing.
I find it simpler to be hypnotized by something out of my control,
Because if I fail, at least the fault‚Äôs not really my own. 

I‚Äôm asking for forgiveness, 
Working on accepting my own weakness,
And most importantly acknowledging that it exists 
Can‚Äôt put into words for me how hard that is.

Taking responsibility for my decisions, 
Instead of just writing them off as addictions.
The truth is, I‚Äôm making a choice when I‚Äôm indifferent, 
Falling deeper into holes of someone else‚Äôs digging.

There will always be things around me that I can‚Äôt change, 
But I‚Äôm learning that doesn‚Äôt have to mean accepting pain.
Can‚Äôt control the wind, but I can choose the route I take 
Choppy waves can  send you off course, but also propel you farther with the same wave

Anyway, thanks for listening, don‚Äôt come consistently 
But sometimes I still need an AA meeting",2

I confronted him about it and urged him to attend rehab, which he reluctantly agreed to. And that basically brings us up to date.

This post is basically a vent of sorts. I've agreed to keep up discretion in our real lives, both for his sake and mine, so the internet is really the only place I can get my thoughts on the table to anyone besides him.

When he got home yesterday, I could tell his skin was brighter. I didn't even know he was doing drugs until right before he left so I also didn't notice the difference if made on his appearance. It's not like he had scars on his face and looked like a ""typical crackhead"" before but anyone could see he's better groomed now than he was a few weeks ago.

In his absence, I've had a lot of time to think. We've been together for a few years now and I don't want this obstacle to be the end of us. But I'm not naively optimistic either. He's not going to stop doing crack just because he loves me oh so much and everything will be a perfect happy ending. As much as I hate the idea, if he repeatedly, over the next few months, chooses drugs over me, I will leave.

That said... Even though it's only been a day, and the real trials are still ahead of us, I can't help but be hopeful. He was in tears for hours before he left and now he is enthusiastic about proving to me and himself that he's better than any stupid addictive chemicals. He stopped smoking once before and only recently picked it up again. Since he wasn't, idk, fully swept back in yet so to speak, I want to believe that he can do it. We can do it.

I'm still kinda pissed at him for hiding it from me. Not as much as I was, but it will take a while to rebuild that trust. I've explained that to him and he's been understanding. I love him so much.

Well, I guess that's all I have to say for now. I'll probably be posting more updates as time passes, we come to bumps in the road or gave achievements to celebrate. Hope you all have a great day.",6

My mom is a substance abuse counselor, she found her passion after fighting this same addiction for 10 years, and she went to school and got a Master's so she could work in that field. She's amazing at what she does because she has the actual experience and the education to go with it. I've always been so proud of her for what she accomplished. So it's hard for me to believe that I ever let myself try it at all... but what's done is done. She's schooling me on a lot, it's like things I've heard before, but they take on new meaning now that I actually *know* it to go along with the words.

My sister and I have different fathers, but both were and still are, to varying degrees, addicted to crack.

I am a preclinical researcher aiming to create new therapeutic strategies, harm reduction tools and medications to better assist those with SUDs. I have created this survey because I believe there is a lack of translational research and understanding about what people truly have experienced and want to see.

This survey was created with addicts in recovery and I really hope you all can share and respond to this.

**This survey aims to collect demographic information (sex, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity) from those with experience or diagnosis with substance use, abuse, or substance use disorders. This survey also aims to obtain information about experiences in recovery, abstinence from use, drug of choice and other specifics associated with use. There will also be questions regarding difficulty in recovery and how helpful specific treatments or groups may have been to individuals. This survey will be completely anonymous and participants are asked to please answer all questions to the best of their ability. The hope of this specific survey is that the answers provided will aid in better informing pre-clinical and clinical researchers focused on finding better interventions for substance use disorders within different populations.

I spent about 3 months quitting smoking daily. I think I was earnestly as delusional as someone can get. Drug addiction right!

I'm 2 week no smoke - and I made a documentary about the whole relapse. I thought I'd share it here: https://vimeo.com/user160130995/willpower

Once I was so desperate for a Juul charger when I faced an 8 hour flight, I made a sign with toilet paper and pasted it in the food court. It said ""If anyone has a juul charger meet me in gate 23."" No joke. And yet rock bottom was to come.

That's just to say, I'm 2 weeks off which is big for me, and if anyone here is struggling with how hard it is, I'm with you. All*n C*rr can go f*ck himself. Eventually, I realized that it's okay for it to be hard because quitting is the hardest thing I'll ever have to do. But it‚Äôs the most important thing I'll ever do. And I'm better for it.

But yeah it was/is fucking hell. Anyway thought I would share. 

Happy new year. Good luck everyone. Much love.",7

I started alcohol at 12 and went hard until 20 when I moved to drugs. I started weed at 16 and other drugs at 20. This past year I've done many drugs such as, psychedelics (acid, shrooms, etc), dissociatives (ketamine, nitrous), stimulatants (mdma, mephadrone), research chemicals (4 ho met, MAL, 3mmc). Not all tried drugs are included in the brackets, just some examples. 
My biggest issue has been daily cannabis use though, due to its accessibility in Canada and it being legal and mostly accepted by family and friends. 
But in this new year I've made myself a drug schedule in hopes of controlling my abuse and cutting out most of the drugs by the end of the year. 
The schedule is weekends only for weed. Twice a month for the first few months I can trip on psychedelics and once a month for the first 3 months I can use stims. After that it moves to 1 trip (psychedelic use) a month and 1 roll(stim use) every 3. 
But its only been 2 days and I'm an absolute wreck. I sleep all day and cry all night. I don't eat or leave my room. I am extremely angry and upset and keep lashing out at friends who try to help. I'm stuck in the mentality that this isn't worth it and nothing will ever feel better. 
I keep considering rehab but I feel so weak and like such an idiot for needing it and I'm scared everyone will laugh at me for ""needing rehab for weed"" or whatever. I'm aware of how dumb that sounds but at the same time I can't really control it or change it. 
I dont feel like I belong in this world or even in this skin. I genuinely don't know how to live sober. 
I really need help..",3

I‚Äôve been smoking/snorting cocaine since I was 15 years old. I‚Äôm currently 19. I started a few days after my birthday, I was hanging out with some friends that were older than I was(16-17) they told me ‚Äúit‚Äôll feel good and you‚Äôll look cool‚Äù stupid freshman me believed them.

So I did them at parties, friends house. I thought it would be easy to quit, I told myself ‚ÄúI can quit whenever I want, if I don‚Äôt want to do it anymore I‚Äôll just stop taking it‚Äù. Well 2 years later, news flash I couldn‚Äôt stop.  I hated myself for being addicted so I tried to get clean. Then after I couldn‚Äôt I hated myself even more, I couldn‚Äôt get clean I had lost so many friends, relationships, and opportunities. 

I tried to kill myself at the end of 17, overdosing on coke. My vision started getting blurry, and then I realized I didn‚Äôt want to do it. I stood up to get my phone on the dresser, but as soon as I took a step I fell. I don‚Äôt remember anything after that, I woke up in the hospital. My mom told me she came in my room because she heard a loud noise, and found me having a seizure. Apparently when I fell I knocked down a whole bunch of shit on my dresser.

Im glad that I didn‚Äôt die that day but even that wasn‚Äôt enough to get me clean. When I was in the hospital my dad never came in. When I got home I was home for about to weeks and then I found myself in Boot Camp. I fucking hated it but, it got me clean for a little while. I still figured out a way to get it when I was in there. And then I got kicked out because of it. But I came home and my dad didn‚Äôt talk to me again. 

I moved out and I‚Äôm currently living with my sister. I used to self harm but it‚Äôs gotten a lot worse, I‚Äôve missed out on basically my entire high school experience. I‚Äôm not anywhere close to clean, fuck I was doing it while typing all of this. I miss when I was a kid, when I wasn‚Äôt like this. My girlfriend recently broke up with me because I promised I‚Äôd get clean, but I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs so fucking hard. I‚Äôve been struggling with this for 4 years, I have other addictions but this is the most dangerous.

Cocaine has made me an entirely different person, I‚Äôm skinny, I‚Äôm aggressive and agitated easily. I‚Äôm basically alone because I don‚Äôt want to bother my friends. I‚Äôm sure I can quit, but I enjoy the high so much.",7

How it started‚Ä¶
I remember having a breakdown after my ex beat my ass like I was a man his size because I refused to get his initials tattooed on my body. Going outside & sitting on the porch shaking uncontrollably, bawling and trying to catch my breath when a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù gave me what she called a ‚Äòpeach‚Äô [alprazolam 0.5mg] to ‚Äòhelp me calm down‚Äô and I appreciated the gesture. It really helped. But I guess I appreciated it too much.
I remember only wanting to take Xanax by myself or at night‚Ä¶ maybe with close friends if I was feeling like it. 
Then it was feeling the need to take that sh*t just to attend a family dinner. It was picking up doing coke on top of Xanax. just to stay awake to work my 10hr shift. 
It was figuring out which addiction I‚Äôm going to be able to afford to feed today. Then getting to the point where it wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgood day‚Äù or I‚Äôm not leaving the house or in a good mood unless I could get high.

How it ended..
After wrecking 3 cars, embarrassing myself more than I could or want to count and losing several jobs, I finally went Cold Turkey in August 2021 but by December I was having anxiety attacks again, I was stressed but whatever there‚Äôs no excuse. I hit up my old plug and bought a single xanax. I hated it. I mean to the point where I regretted taking it immediately. I considered making myself throw up just to get some of it out. I just went home and the Shit knocked me out cold for nearly 12hrs.

The days after taking it I had heartburn/upset stomach, jitters & twitches and I thought I was just coming down with something until it occurred to me ‚Äúdumb ass, you felt like this when you went through withdrawals trying to go cold turkey the first several times‚Äù but how??!? I tapered myself off through June-July, stopped in august and my withdrawal symptoms were slim-to-none atp. So how could this be happening now? It feel exactly the same symptoms but wtf?

I haven‚Äôt used since but I still feel like shit.",2

I've been smoking cigarettes for 2 years and started getting into coke a year ago. Mostly concerned obout the coke, but smoking also heavily impeads my health.

Started smoking in 2020 simply because my friends did. Was never pressured but after 3 years of them smoking I got curious and dove in. It was what I called social lubricant lol. Just made conversations smoother I found.

Coke was easily accessible to me and started doing it for free at the beggining of 2021. 6 months in I started buying my own because I didn't want to feel like I was being a parasite on those who readily shared. Skip forward another 6 months to today, I've spent more money than I'd thought I'd be spending and am currently on a 2 week daily usage streak. It's not out of hand yet. I haven't lost friends nor have I dug myself into a financial pit, but I can see that happening and I don't want that.

I am willing to take any and all advice. Please if you have any wisdom to offer me, I will take it.",8

I had a gambling problem that initially got out of hand that I‚Äôd been dealing with that I currently have under control. 

I have a porn addiction that I am not doing great with. 

And I have been increasingly been getting myself into social situations that are not great simply for the adrenaline rush. 

A part of the issue is that the rush is what I use to make myself get out of the house every day. 

I feel like I‚Äôve been playing Jenga with my personality. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs all teetering on one facet of my identity but I feel certain impulses come on and i work to turn them off just to pop up in another area of my life. 

I know that there is some sort of neuropsychological explanation dealing with dopamine that can explain it, I need it dealt with though. Medicine, therapy or self therapeutic experiences, something. 

All not healthy behaviors at all. If I stop one the impulse gets stronger to engage with the others. 

It truly feels like I‚Äôm another person. 

Does medication help with the impulse control issues, if I am in fact deemed to have something severely wrong. 

As this does all feel relatively new, and has been getting worse over the years, is there some specific disorder or anything I can ask an expert about?


I have other issues surrounding this , however the rest of these are manageable, and not the thing I care about the most, but I am having social issues, making people in my life uncomfortable for the rush of it, and this is again, all relatively new. 

It‚Äôs been steadily creeping into my psyche for a few years, and while I‚Äôm not say, in jail or anything, I don‚Äôt want this to continue to the point where I am completely lacking in self awareness of the issue, especially since my brain can recognize that this other part of my brain is a problem, and it‚Äôs scaring me and making me feel bad about the people I have affected, and the type of guy I used to be.",1

I don‚Äôt know what the main drug they do is, I know they smoke dope because It stinks the entire house out but the main drug they do is on tin foil/aluminium foil. Is it really heroin ? That‚Äôs what research I‚Äôve done is leading to it being ? 

I don‚Äôt know where to start on helping them. Our relationship is like a completely normal loving family and I don‚Äôt want to ruin anything you know ? We‚Äôre pretty poor and might be kicked out our house soon and said house is a wreck by the way, they don‚Äôt take care of anything other than the basics food, water, heat, electricity etc.

Please help me. This really hurts me to my core. I‚Äôll answer and talk to anyone who has any ideas or suggestions on how to help, thanks <3",6

I‚Äôve always been a heavy drinker, my parents have wine with dinner most nights so I was brought up around alcohol. At age 20 I found cocaine, and loved that on nights out, but over lockdown I started to take cocaine whilst drinking alone at home as I realised I could still get the same highs and euphoria without being at a club. 

My problem has become two fold; I‚Äôm 26 now and for the last 6 years I‚Äôve been trying to reduce my alcohol intake and failing (always give in after about 3 days).. but now recently I heavily associate cocaine with alcohol, so whenever I‚Äôm drinking I want to get cocaine as well. I feel I now can‚Äôt drink without thinking about cocaine. 

I feel completely helpless and unable to quit alcohol, and every time I say it every one laughs because I‚Äôve said it a thousand times and I genuinely can‚Äôt do it.  

I contacted drug and alcohol support but they were pretty useless as I‚Äôm not imminently about to die so they always just say ‚Äòit‚Äôs good that you‚Äôre making steps to quit!‚Äô Which obviously doesn‚Äôt help. The fact that I now take cocaine so frequently leads me to drink even more. 

Where can I find the motivation to cut down? And how do I divorce the association between alcohol and coke?",4

I drank almost every night for maybe two weeks. At night when drunk at my computer I started vaping as well. I had a vape just for the occasional use when out with friends, it takes away my social anxiety, so I always intended it as a rare treat because of how toxic those things are. As I was saying I started vaping at night, It just felt good, and I was drunk so I didn't care.

I figured as long as I only vape when I drink, and I only drink on weekends then I can't get too addicted. So now here I am, after the holidays, and for the last few days, I haven't had any alcohol or nicotine left. So I agreed with myself, that that's it, that was a treat for the holidays and now I'll wait until the weekend to do anything. 

It's been surprisingly shitty. Like at nighttime, I'm just bored. I naturally sleep into noon during breaks, so half my day is at nighttime on my computer with no one around. The natural thing to do is drink or smoke, now I'm just bored. This is my fourth night without anything, and every night I crave nicotine and alcohol. 

The boredom makes the craving worse, the craving makes me anxious (I don't want this to be a problem), and the boredom and anxiety make me depressed. I don't know if I'm actually addicted, or my anxiety about getting addicted is making me think I am, combined with the fact that I'm so bored I keep thinking of how I'd rather be drinking.

I decided that I'm not going to drink until the weekend, just so I'm following rules and not going too gung ho. As for the vape, I feel so ashamed I don't think I'll buy more anytime soon, but that doesn't mean I don't want it every night. 

Can someone tell me if this is normal? Does this sound like a problem? Should I worry?",1

my dad was an pretty serious alcoholic and i know i‚Äôve always had an addictive personality from my history with self harm and eating disorders. but i‚Äôve only misused alcohol on and off for a few years since i was 18, and it‚Äôs only ever been a bit in the morning or before something i‚Äôm anxious about, in the evenings to relax and sleep, and what seemed like normal uni binge drinking until i realised i was taking that to dangerous extremes (trying to run away from anyone i know, having sex with dickhead strangers, passing out on the street). whenever i‚Äôve tried to not drink or do drugs i find it impossible. 

also last summer while i was living with my family i started doing a small amount of coke every day to cope with my mental health and eating disorder. i had withdrawal symptoms when i stopped and swore i‚Äôd never do it again, but it only lasted about 2 months. i‚Äôve recently started doing it again, triggered by my friends getting coke in on new year‚Äôs eve. 

i know my use of substances is unhealthy, but i feel like i‚Äôm overreacting with thinking of them as an addiction and wanting to get sober. i almost feel like i‚Äôm mocking real addicts by thinking my issues are bad. it‚Äôs okay if nobody has advice, i just don‚Äôt know what to think or do. thanks and sorry üíó",6

Right now I‚Äôve been clean of cocaine for around 2 years but I drink more than the recommended amounts of alcohol per week.

I enjoy watching movies in general but when I watch movies themed around addiction it gives me mixed feelings. 

I love Beautiful Boy with Steve Carrell as well as Ben is Back with Julia Roberts... I feel it represents a good example of the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù (whatever that means) person who had a supportive family but can‚Äôt help but resist their affliction.

I suppose the reason why I‚Äôm posting this is because though watching these movies makes me emotional, it makes me emotional for two different reasons and I was hoping people would relate and perhaps find resolutions to enjoy these films and relate to these characters but at the same time separate yourself from their addictions.

A part of me wants to return to that toxic lifestyle but then a part of me feels intense emotion with tearfulness and how this disease affects both ourselves and our families as well as considering the stigma associated with it. 

It‚Äôs a complex dynamic of emotions, and I was wondering how others have experienced the involvement of addictions in social media e.g. films that I have previously mentioned

They've been using for about 2 years now, and most times smoking, they are fine..

However, sometimes they have a strange experience. Sometimes this occurs when they have spent the night smoking quite a lot, sometimes they experience this when they've had their first pipe of the day and continue to have this problem.

When they are smoking, it's almost instantly making them feel sick, makes their gag reflex sensitive and feels like their stomach is convulsing.

With a pattern of controlled breathing, swallowing and controlling themselves, they can calm themselves down and they don't vomit, but if they don't control themselves, they vomit straight away.

They said it feels like someone is squeezing their stomach which causes the sickness.

When you are ill, have flu or food poisoning for example, and you vomit, you get that thing where your mouth fills up with water and sometimes get pain, but they don't experience this when they vomit from the crack.

As soon as they've inhaled the pipe, they feel instantly nauseous and causes them to cough sometimes .. when they breathe, they do this strange thing with their breath sometimes.. only way I can explain it, is perhaps when you have been crying a lot, and you start to calm down, and you have short bursts of rapid, uncontrolled breathing, almost like a hiccup, this is what they experience while trying to breathe through the nausea and control themselves..

They have been able to stop themselves from being sick from the breathing and swallowing, and it seems that what makes them want to vomit is this convulsive feeling in the stomach and the fast heart rate.

Usually this happens when they've smoked a lot, and then for the rest of that night/day, everytime they smoke, it makes them nauseous.. but some days, they will experience this just from the first pipe, and again, everytime they smoke after this, they get nauseous and want to vomit..

Does anyone know why this is happening and what they can do to stop this from happening, the obvious answer is to stop smoking, but they're not going to do that so I want to be able to give them good harm reduction advice and advice that is going to stop them vomitting and being ill, trying to keep them as safe as possible, while they are using.. thanks",1

It is hard work, even in the moments it is pure fun, and should never be looked at as something else. Only because you can get addicted to hard work does not mean it will get easy.

I flushed my drugs down the toilet today.,"So, currently my amphetamine use hasn't been as bad as it was a couple months back, when I abused my dexedrine prescription. However, I relapsed two weeks ago on some amphetamine salts I ordered from darkweb.

Anyways, this drug is definitely a favorite of mine but also destroys me and sends me to rock bottom really fast. Without going into too much detail, it makes me masturbate A LOT. It's extremely unhealthy for me. Aside from all this, I've been suffering from mental health issues and I live with chronic fatigue and some form of anhedonia (socially, academically etc).

So, I guess you understand why I turn to stimulants, it's to cope with my lazy, unmotivated behavior. However, interestingly enough, amphetamines can often worsen my condition. I have trouble regulating my use and I was up all the night today, with a total of 30 minutes sleep, and I have eaten so little lately, that my legs and arms are shaking from muscle weakness. 

There are some major life changes coming up very soon (my first dog, etc) and I think this acted as a wake up call. I need to get rid of my unhealthy habits and the dog is a huge motivation for me. Starting today, I'll give my best at fighting my unhealthy urges. It'll be extremely difficult, but  I do believe in myself this time.

I‚Äôm also heavily addicted to watching porn and eating sweets as well, but I‚Äôll start with pop for now. I first started when I got my first job working retail. For my job, I would drink 2-4 pops per shift, and I‚Äôd work 4-5 days a week. I also drank pop a lot outside of work, which costed me a lot of money, just wasted on my addiction. During Christmas break, I have drank multiple 2 liters, bought multiple bottles, & drank 2 12 packs of Pepsi from a can.
Im not really going to get too much into my sweets addiction, because it isn‚Äôt as bad as the other 2. When I was working retail at that same time, I would buy 4-6 king size Reece‚Äôs cups, and I‚Äôd buy even more outside of work. So I‚Äôve really been addicted to candy and stuff like that for 8-9 months as well. I‚Äôve had sweets almost every day since, and I have a big bag of smarties currently in my food storage area in my room, which I want to finish but I know I can‚Äôt.
I‚Äôve started watching porn & jacking off (they go together) when I was 10, but got addicted about 12. At some points I would do it once every few days, then that turned into 1-2 times a day, and even at some points 1-5 times a day. At this point in my life its been 1-2 times a day. I think the main reason I‚Äôm so hooked on it, other than the fact it made me feel good, is that I‚Äôve never got any action and always have wanted action. That‚Äôs the only way to pleasure myself, and it‚Äôs only hurting me. I need to stop drinking so much pop and watching so much porn.
Everything I‚Äôve talked about is really becoming an issue, and I finally have the courage and want to stop all of this, wish me luck guys!",8

He has been addicted to meth for years. He injects it. 

Recently, his drug abuse has made his life go off the rails. In the last three months, he lost his job, his housing, and most of his property was stolen. He lives in Ames, IA.

My brother expresses interest in treatment. I talked to him tonight. He is open about not being able to quit on his own and wanting to figure things out. I want to help him find a place to go. His thinking seems a little scattered. He has been to treatment in another state before. I have referred him to harm reduction resources in Iowa. I have also sent him the SAMSHA hotline number and findtreatment.gov. 

What else can I do to support him and give him the best chance at recovery? How did you or your loved one find treatment? Should he consider going to a different state? Whatever he does probably needs to be low-cost or free because he doesn't have insurance or money right now and I can provide only limited support.

I bought a nice Koa wood guitar from which I got a nice buzz. Now I want more, a Rosewood or Mahogany instrument for some difficult buzz.

But most addictions are mislabeled as a being sick in my opinion. The real sickness is the reason why you are sensitive to creating that addiction. Having experienced a few NA/AA sessions myself, left me with weird cult like feelings.

I mean I get it, some people will never be able to face the root of the problem. So creating a perception that NA/AA meetings and religion is the reason for your success, can be helpful tools.

But as someone who struggled with substance use myself, the real reason is always something deeper. For example: You won't have trouble with opioids if there is no pain to relieve to begin with. Sure you may experience real euphoria the first time, but when you start using it more and more, there is something in that sedating effect which you like. That might point to some undealt emotions.

Now I don't have a problem with how some may overcome their addiction in a different way. I just think labeling addiction as a sickness may cause people to stop exploring themself mentally and just all blame it on the addiction, instead of discovering the real reason behind your need for sedation.

I even think that if you really really overcome the source of the problem. you should be able to in the case of alcohol drink recreative again. Banning alcohol totally is easier compared to being in control mentally. If you really have found the cause of the need for sedation, you can learn to face it in a healthy way. Which eventually even could mean, that you would be able to use the substance again under control and pure recreative. Although using opioids recreative seems to indicate you may still have an issue, so with substances like that it's a different story. But Alcohol, Nicotine, Sex, most stimulants shouldn't be a problem to take again at maybe special occasions.

And I know I am forgetting some big parts like braking the habit and creating a different pattern, which is also a big part in fixing an addiction, but calling that a sickness idk.",4

She is now going to get an equity release on the house (she owns it outright) to supposedly pay off her debts and allow her to be in a better financial position and is looking for jobs.

I myself have only just graduated university, started working a good job, and have finally been given the opportunity to build up a life for myself and save. Now this happens. She asked me the other day if I could lend her ¬£500, to which I got angry purely because honestly I  can't comprehend how stupid you have to be to get yourself in this situation in the first place - after splitting from my Dad, she was left with a sizeable amount to pay off her mortgage and have savings. Also the fact that I too live with expenses - like rent, food, utilities is further reason for me saying no.

Not only that, she acknowledges she has a problem and wants to get better, but I have seen no action whatsoever being taken. I offered to pay for some rehab treatment costs after Christmas, and the plan was she was going to go there, but then she bailed from that idea because she says 'when she comes back she needs a job to come back to so she won't be bored or have nothing to do all day which might influence her to take again or something along the lines of that'. To me it's just an excuse.

I feel ashamed, upset, angry and disappointed because her actions have had consequences on us all. I feel guilty about not giving her money, but then I think why should I - you got yourself in this mess in the first place, and me giving you money only goes to fuel the addiction. If I offer to pay bills etc I'm incurring a heavy expense and it makes my cost of living hard, not only that but any money she generates can then be used for more drugs. In my opinion, her continuing to behave like this is selfish.

She's really annoyed, upset and angered me, and although I want to be there to support her, I can't not help but feel these things. I've always had a mentality of tough love, that the only person who can help you is yourself. I wouldn't mind if it was a situation such as she was out of luck, something out of her control has happened and she needed help, but she was fully in control when making this stupid decision which has ultimately ruined her life. It's all very obvious to her and everyone around her that continuing to make this decision is going to have, yet of course the chemical high seems to neglect the responsible, moral way of thinking. 

tldr; Is it ok to refuse giving my Mum money? I'm annoyed as I'm at the start of my career, only just been given the opportunity to save, and this happens.",3

Me and my other friends were kind of worried about this move since they would be in a completely new state, not knowing anyone but their abusive mother with BPD and their complacent dad. Before moving, my two friends were also both suffering from weed dependency, nicotine addiction, and depression, and one of them (who this post is mainly about) was also showing signs of an eating disorder. Since they‚Äôve moved, we‚Äôve grown distant just by virtue of the literal distance between us and I‚Äôve been busy with school, but they visited in October and things seemed to be okay. But tonight, one of my other friends revealed that the girl who this post is about has a private story that none of us are on in which she discusses all of her unprotected hookups and abusive relationships, and also posted images of hard drugs as well. I fear it‚Äôs only going to get worse, and I‚Äôm just so scared because the only support system she has around her is her sister who is already suffering so much on her own. They were going to save up money to move out of their abusive mother‚Äôs house, but considering how much my friend is spending on weed and plan B (she is not on the pill and buys plan B every time she has sex), it does not seem like they are getting out of there any time soon, and they have lost the motivation to do it anyways. It breaks my heart to know that she is in so much pain, but it also really hurts to know that she hid this from me and my friends and felt like she couldn‚Äôt tell us. I know it is probably coming from a place of shame, and she may also be hiding this stuff from her sister, but she is one of my best friends and it sucks finding out that she‚Äôs hiding a whole part of her life from me. Because I am not supposed to know all of this and she lives so far away, I‚Äôm at a loss for what to do. My one friend on the private story has tried giving her advice, but there‚Äôs only so much she can do when she‚Äôs  thousands of miles away. I‚Äôm so scared it‚Äôs gonna get worse and I don‚Äôt know how to help. Any advice?",2

I recently had a relapse and coincidentally found this text on my phone and I just felt that I needed to share it with someone and not keep it hidden anymore.

When i walk through your field of broken flowers and trampled dreams I feel the burn of your poisonous love, the one love that will stay by my side, the love that lead me to a purgatory that time will not abide. 

A purgatory so real I can feel its claws upon the vessels in my arms. My arms display all your victories over me, all the times I failed to keep the hunger at bay, all the times I failed the friends I've lost. 

When the burden of this earth shall fly of my shoulders and my fire for you is finally extinguished, I shall breath free with the friends you have taken from me, not think of the pain I feel now, but focus on the relief that I shall receive when I finally take the big one.",1

I‚Äôve also talked to friends who have gone to treatment centers and gotten this information from them and my own experience. A lot of treatment centers and sober houses I hate their principals. For example my friends sober house wants him to get rid of and not talk to any of his childhood friends just because he has causally drank with them before, even if they won‚Äôt drink around him anymore and aren‚Äôt addicted themselves. His sober house also isn‚Äôt letting him leave or switch treatments. For me I went to outpatient treatment and they wanted me to get rid of any and all old friends and quit my job (instead of waiting 2 weeks for my schedule change to go into affect). I noped outta their real quick. It seems like all these places just keep making extreme requests that will end up screwing you over more than anything. Instead of intwining sobriety into your current life they want to uproot everything and start over. I personally hate these centers and very much prefer the AA method. This is just a rant though so I apologize.",2

I've been in recovery for awhile and I'm curious if anyone else has had an overdose-related NDE that they would like to share with me for some research I'm doing.

I had one. Long story short, it was black and dark but then I was floating up toward the ceiling, all in white, with my body on the floor below me. I could hear voices arguing with each other about whether or not it was my time. I could hear the voice of my fiance who passed away and I remember him telling someone in charge ‚Äúit‚Äôs not too late, he just gave her the Narcan, it can still work! We don't have to take her!‚Äù Then a few moments later I felt like I was surrounded by people with their hands on me, lowering me back down into my body. I wasn't breathing for 6 minutes and the person with me couldn't feel a pulse.

Anyway, I've been looking into NDEs a lot and I figured ‚ÄúWell, who dies and come back to life more often than someone who has been Narcan‚Äôd?‚Äù

Even if you have a NDE not related to overdose, opioids, or Narcan, I‚Äôd still like to hear about it. You can either share it in a comment or message me for privacy.

I‚Äôm just trying to make sense of the experience I had (and others that have come afterward).

His brother however, has been an addict for around 15 years and has literally never been clean for more than a couple weeks. I have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half and during that time I‚Äôve watched his brother manipulate and ab*se his mother and cause complete upheaval in their family. I love their mother. She‚Äôs one of the most caring, generous people I‚Äôve ever met, but she struggles deeply to set boundaries with her son. She asks me advice, I give it. My whole family has struggled with addiction, but we‚Äôre all clean of our respective vices now. I know that I can‚Äôt imagine how it feels to have a son that lies and steals from you regularly. 

When I first got into the relationship, I was naive to the situation and was eager to help get his brother clean. We let him move in with us. We spent hours with him. Brought him with us to all our activities, gave peps talks, bought him food, helped with his bills etc. i knew very early on into this arrangement that his brother was not clean. I told both my boyfriend and his mother this, but they doubted me. I haven‚Äôt known him as long as they have. I took a step back. It turned out I was right and he was still using pretty much everything. He was also stealing money from his mother. 

After this they decided to cut ties with him. The upset of this situation was a trigger for my boyfriend and he relapsed. Not on anything serious, but it was really rough. After a tough talk, he got clean and he‚Äôs been doing really well for the last 3 months. I know that relapse is a possibility. He put in the effort and got back to green. I‚Äôm proud of him. 

This is the thing. A month ago, his brother decided to go to rehab. This is the third time he‚Äôs gone, but APPARENTLY this time he actually got off everything and put in the work. He just got out and will be living in a sober living community. My boyfriend seems very hopeful and wants to start seeing his brother again, but I don‚Äôt. After hearing all the stories and seeing the pattern over the last year and a half, I don‚Äôt trust his brother at all. I don‚Äôt like how much he‚Äôs hurt my boyfriend and his mother. I don‚Äôt like how much he‚Äôs disrupted even my own life. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad person but he‚Äôs done some horrific things to his family. 

My boyfriend told me he wants to bring his brother to our house today and my first response was ‚Äòwhy?‚Äô  I didn‚Äôt mean to say it the way I did, but I‚Äôm over it man. I could tell this upset him and he said ‚ÄòDo I need a reason ti see my brother?‚Äô  

I want to be supportive, but their dynamic is so unhealthy and I worry that if his brother relapses, that my boyfriend will have another downward spiral. I think he should stay away from him until he‚Äôs proven he can make it on his own. I don‚Äôt know what to say. I just know I don‚Äôt want to deal with this anymore. 

TL;DR: my boyfriend‚Äôs brother got out of rehab for the 3rd time. After all the upheaval he‚Äôs caused, I don‚Äôt want anything to do with him until he‚Äôs clean long term. I don‚Äôt know how to tell my boyfriend this, or even if I should. This has all been exhausting.",9

You pull me in your direction, the creator of intimidation 

Catch myself doing things I would never do, 

Lying and stealing off people who don't mean a thing to you 

Feels like a losing battle trying to beat you, I know 

You love it, you crave it, you always stick around for the show¬† 

You told me you loved me, you told me we would be together for eternity 

I tried to get away, but you told me you were here to stay 

You're everywhere, ruining lives of many 

Killing spirits, taking souls of plenty

He is an extremely smart kid but is now on the verge of quitting his PhD. We've invited him over because his messages recently indicate that he is having suicidal thoughts. He also has a very long to-do list that he's procrastinated over for a year now.

We understand we can't get him out of the addiction but we clear out his task backlog and get him to move forward in life. Our goal is to provide a change in environment for him, and hope that can help him start from a clean slate.

We've set some rules like no smoking and hard drugs at home because we really do not want any of that in our house.
