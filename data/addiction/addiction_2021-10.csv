Boyfriend has been lying constantly about his addiction. He didn't tell me even before getting together but had said he was done. He's not done, he's constantly lying to me, even when I catch him in the act or end up stumbling across his stashe. I love him so dearly, im trying to support him the best I can, in any way he wants me too but I can't help feeling hurt, espcially with the un-trust between both sides. He is in a rehab type place. He goes some days of the week to get medicine to supposedly help him because he shouldn't be doing any drugs technically but he still does.

I'm never been mad at him or upset with him, even when he lies and I can't help feeling like I'm losing hope with him. He is addicted to opiates and uses needles whenever he does use. Recently, I found a stashe when I was looking for him throughout the house, but he swears its old. It was needles and a spoon with residue still on it...I want to believe him, but how do I? You'd think I would automatically, but he's lied so much and the same thing keeps happening. ""Oh its old"", or ""that's actually for someone else"". 

I am severely un-educated in this topic of addiction and drugs, but I am trying my best to learn everyday. 
We've been together for a little over 2 years now. I can't help but feel like he took advantage of my trust and not having knowledge in this...I trusted him for years and didn't even know he was using earlier when our relationship was still new but as I'm learing more I found out that he was. I'm being patient with him and trying to be here to support him but I fear I'm not sure when to recognize when is too late in our relationship. And I know it might sound dumb, ""if you truly love him, you'd never give up on him, you'll always be there for him"" and I think of this every day and I feel as though I am stuck as to what to do and that I should just stay regardless of my feelings. I don't want to hurt him even more, I fear if I leave that'd he'd be using even more.

I don't feel as though my patience is wearing thin with him, as I'll always support him, even if I do leave...but whether he wants to help himself, as I feel I can't support him anymore than I am. I even ask him, ""what can I do better?"", ""is there anything I can do for you or that you need from me?"" But he says ""my support is enough"" and never talks about anything.

And I do think to myself, if I'm already asking myself if I need to leave, should I have done that already? Besides his drug addiction, out relationship is perfect, everything I could of asked for. So im currently stuck in my thoughts not knowing what to do. It hurts me so much that he is hurting himself, but I fear he doesn't care to heal, and I feel as though he doesn't care about my feelings about him using.

Please help me..any advice is welcomed, I don't know how to think. I'm in my early twenties and he's in his mid twenties if it helps at all...I don't have any friends so I don't get to vent, even then I don't feel like it's my place to talk about his addiction but im just so torn right now, it hurts everyday seeing him like this.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.510322}"

It's pretty sad and awful this fact, I know I'm a failure. In the same time, I didn't properly like anyone in terms of falling in love, just a little simpathy that passes fast. I feel ashamed because I buyed porn and I'm a bit sexual obsessed and I'm horny all the time. I tried to cut it off for two weeks, but in the end I gave up. The other obsession is I don't accept anyone to control me, I'm obsessed about being in control and I recently developed some angry issues. The problem is if I try to cut it off completely, I will still have obsessive sexual thoughts. Sometimes I feel that human beings are like drug addicted people : they are addicted by their own chemical resources and I noticed that if they someone to get laid with, they will put you on the second place. I feel my way of thinking became sick towards all the people. I didn't understand the love at all, I just see people becoming addicted to other people. In the same time, I'm afraid because I didn't feel happy for a long time : no passions, no thing to make me excited, I feel I can understand the joke or that fact, but it doesn't turn on my interest at all. I'm literally a robot who needs serotonin obtained both through masturbation and sugar. I can't find any other thing to make me happy, excited or enthusiastic.

I work two jobs and can't afford myself new clothes because of constantly trying to patch up this mess.   
And i know there's no easy way out, getting a new place to live and a meaningful job will be a long and excruciating process, I won't even be young by then.

After some time i realized it won't help. I found a person who loves me even like this, and so happy to be with him I'd walk through hell naked to carry him out.

How do I quit my job?,"I’ve been in active addiction for nearly a year. I’ve decided I need to go to rehab, as it is the only way I will get better. I am depressed and worried about my health. Issue is I work full time. A few months ago I had told my boss I would be leaving at the end of the year, as I will be resuming school (which is true), but I cannot wait that long, also, I reached my out of pocket for my insurance for this year so if I went at the start of next year, I would have to pay a crazy amount. 

So yeah. I need to leave. Sooner than later. I’m financially stable so I do not need the job to pay my bills, so that’s good. The real issue is my job has a very low staff count (only three people) and I have a lot of responsibilities (it would put a big strain on my boss if I wasn’t there). Also, the third person who works there ended up in the hospital this week, and we are not sure when she will be back. The worker shortage has made it difficult to find quality people in general, so it may take my boss a while to fill my role. Furthermore, on top of this, we are reaching our busy season (November December) and my help is needed more than ever. 

I don’t know if this is the right sub to ask all of this, (if not please shoot me sub suggestions) but I really need advice on how to leave. Preferably sooner than later. Ultimately, it will put a major strain on my boss (who is very good to me), but part of me feels as though that is not my responsibility as long as I give her two weeks notice (although I really don’t know if I could wait two weeks). No matter what she will be upset with me. I need to accept that. Rip off the bandaids. 

I just need an excuse as I don’t want to say I need to go to rehab, but maybe it’s for the best to be honest, I just REALLY don’t want to tell her I’m an addict. I’m thinking of making up a health emergency. Or maybe saying my mental health has been bad. Or maybe some kind of family emergency. Difficulties is I’m a bad liar and she is good at spotting liars. 

Idk what I’m really asking here. Maybe just your guys’ thoughts on the matter. It’s really bothering me and it’s hard to talk about it with friends and stuff considering they don’t know about my addiction.

I am a late bloomer when it comes to the addiction thing. I was once just a ""smoke weed once in awhile"" type and the thought of any harder drugs absolutely terrified me. I met my wife 6 years ago and she was about the same as me but with the occasional purchase of pain pills sometimes,  definitely not enough to hurt us financially or to make me wonder. We had gone through a rough patch, I lost my job due to the company going under and we ended up moving in with her mom and her brother. She had already filled me in on her brothers addiction background and her family has always struggled with him in and out of rehab, his drug of choice at the time was heroin. Thier mom is a widow and her brother quickly took advantage of the life insurance nest egg she had acquired along with pawning her wedding rings several times and her mom was just absolutely done and at her wits end trying to get her son back. Fast forward, we end up getting back on our feet and moving out and letting her brother move in with us. I had faith in him and I believe everyone deserves another chance even if it is the 53rd one lol. So I started this awesome job at the county dog shelter, it was the job I had been striving for and things were great. My wife was diagnosed with RA just 2 years prior and was trying to get disability due to the loss of movement in her hands, but we were ok. Her brother would clean our house, I never asked for much from him as long as he respected us and our home. As time goes on he starts asking my wife for money and in return he gives her this powder that he referred to as mostly crushed pain pills. She was skeptical about it and had a little pile of these little folded pieces of paper after a few months or so of his ""trades "". I had been having some major issues sleeping due to my back and restless leg syndrome, she was having her usual pain and in a moment of weakness we said ""fuck it"" I had never snorted anything in my life up until that point. We both just had a very little amount,  it didn't take much. And to say the least it knocked us right out, we slept great and before we knew it and could even wonder that i was addicted, I was bringing it to work and doing it on my lunch break. Now I was prescribed Adderall at the time too and was used to sweating crazily so I had no idea that the days that I did not bring it with me that I was withdrawing. I had turned a blind eye to even dig deeper and ask her brother what the shit really was, and I don't think I wanted to make it a reality. Sooner or later we figure out it is indeed fentynal and that we had to make a plan to stop. We did not know just how extreme the withdrawal was ahead of us, but we did not want this life so we tried. Our first time quitting we did it separately so one of us could take care of the other...cold turkey,  no subs, nothing. To say the least my wife caved on me on day 3 of me rolling around our bed soaked in sweat begging her. Bad idea. Right after this I then lost my awesome job due to the pandemic and being the low man on the totem pole. So then of course being jobless and depressed...where do I turn.


Fast forward again, it's now almost 2 years later and we have been on this endless roller coaster of trying to get sober at least 10 times now. We even traveled to Oregon and went through it 2 weeks only to fail before the car ride home from the airport. I've Seen my wife OD accidentally twice, narcanned her myself. We have gotten sober separately,  which did seem to have a better effect not seeing each other suffer...but still can't make it past a month. I am now taking care of my 76 year old mother and drowning in debt from this demon I can't shake. That's what keeps me from actually going into a rehab facility where I do think it would benefit me the most with the help of therapy and other addicts to talk to. In the past 3 months we both came clean to our families...they were mostly supportive,  except for her mom who took it the hardest due to her brother being an addict. I can understand her moms heartache...but my wife and I have been pretty self sufficient human beings most of our adult lives, and everyone falls from grace.  

  I'm not really sure what to expect from addiction reddit...but getting this all aired out and the possibility of talking to others who have been in similar situations give me hope.

I am a 22 F pharmacy student that gets good grades in pharmacy school, and I also work two pharmacy-related jobs that I perform fine in. I've always been pretty socially anxious and depressed, and I've struggled a lot with low motivation to do things like study and clean my apartment, etc. I also have always had a LOT of trouble paying attention in class to lectures and things like that (very inattentive), so last year, I decided to get tested for ADHD. I answered the questionnaires truthfully, but part of me hoped I would get a positive diagnosis so that I could get some stimulants, which I knew would help my dopamine-lacking brain, boost my motivation, and make me feel happier. 

I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and prescribed 5 mg Adderall to start out with. It made me feel sleepy and so I asked my doctor if I could try 10 mg tabs, and he agreed. I realized that I really liked the way they made me feel! It made me feel guilty, but I got into the habit of taking more than the two tablets per day that were prescribed. Now, a typical day on Adderall for me usually consists of 30 mg in the morning and 20 mg two hours later. In order to keep myself from building a tolerance, I only take the Adderall about 3 -4 days per week so that I can have a few days without it in a row each week. This seems to work pretty well, and I can set days aside and not take any Adderall on those days easily. When the pills kick in about an hour after I take them, I feel this warm glow of energy, motivation, and happiness. It makes my everyday life more fun and I look forward to taking them when I know I will the next day. I am so busy and stressed with school and work, and Adderall gives me the energy and enthusiasm I want to accomplish things. I continue to be highly functional at work and school, and have been for several months now while abusing the Adderall. 

Despite the benefits, I still am deeply ashamed of how I abuse my prescription. I've told literally no one about this, and its wearing on me. I'm good at hiding it - I work in pharmacies and I know exactly how to not draw attention to my misuse. Since I don't take the Adderall everyday, I never run out of my prescription early, and I make sure to ask them to fill it each month when it would be due. I also know to not take the high dose of the Adderall if I have a doctors appointment or something: my high blood pressure from the 50 mg of Adderall would give it away. I never, ever steal medication from other people or my workplaces or anything- I only abuse my prescription. I just hate that I'm living 3 days a week straining my heart and blood vessels under a BP of 145/100- its so unhealthy and I know I can't go on like this forever. I just don't know what to do.",1,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.41473898}"

My dad has been a stock trader for 20+ years. He doesn't day trade. But our family has started to wake up from this lie we've been told. My dad will fall in love with a penny stock or start up. He will put several hundreds of thousand into this stock and follow it for 4-5 years. One stock in particular 10+ years. He will get all our hopes up that the stock will go up 5-20 fold and all our financial problems will be solved. 

In one instance around 2010 it actually came true. He invested my aunts money and made her 3 million dollars in a week. But our side of the family never saw a penny of that. Having seen him do this for my aunt has filled a belief in my siblings and myself. But recently he took out a hard money loan to put it in a penny stock or low value stock. The news he was leading everyone on about came and gone, no money was made. And again the goal post moved to the next ""news, earnings, conference, etc"". He has other opportunity to make money outside trading but he's become less and less interested in them because to them they're ""peanuts"" or small fish. He has even forgone increasing rents on his two real estate properties (that he inherited). 

At the moment he's threatening to sell one of these properties to possibly put into the stock market once again. Our main worry is that we've been following him invest for 20 years and we want him to change or get help. I'm not sure if there's merit since he's not the typical day trading gambler.

just to give you a perspective, out of the 60 summer days, he wasn't high during only 3 days. his close friends and family too (ig) are a little concerned about his situation. with his weed using, depression and anxiety came into his life (as I was having a little depression time too I've helped him, but fortunately this lasted 2-3 weeks) 

he is the type of guy to be very intelligent, but doesn't give a shit about school, like a lot of people, but we have a little problem here. He is at a private catholic school, the same I was before this year before changing. So, with his addiction, I can confirm that this is near impossible to keep up with this work load.

Currently, freeballing, I’m about 2-3 months clean. I love being sober, but it’s just this feeling of brain fog or brain fatigue I can’t get past.

i have been feeling horrible since then, and cant renew my ID without my mom knowing, and don't know how to as she was the one who set me up for my first one years ago. 

thing is, it makes no sense, i'm usually ok for a week without alcohol, but as more time passes the urges become stronger and stronger each day, i have managed to quit i believe for a year and a half, maybe 2 years and remember doing ok after the first month. at that point i was drinking everyday, now i can handle not doing it every day like previously mentioned, but these urges have been highly intense lately.

first thing i got addicted to was video games, been playing them for years, then cigarettes and alcohol, cant see myself quitting smoking.

just wanted to hear others strategies on handling strong intense urges. its so consuming and difficult. not sure if there are breathing techniques or anything like that. thank you.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56371886}"

I almost gave in and had a pouch today. Anyone notice super strong cravings this far in?

Just to provide some insight I am 25 years old and have used nicotine products for 6 years. I used to dip heavily - 2 tins a day (introduced during college baseball). My gums started to recede after about 3 years and out of fear I transitioned to nicotine replacement therapy. I began abusing nicorette chewing no joke >100 mg+ a day popping 3 at a time. The nicotine stimulated me and made me feel sharp. I was able to do tedious tasks for hours out a time and it gave me a sense of motivation.

The past few weeks I’ve felt unproductive at work (no one knows I would do it), I’ve gained 12 pounds (workout daily so that’s fucking with me), and I constantly feel bored.

Anxiety and severe depression
Paranoia/hearing whispers outside my door/window
Brain fog- I have been writing this post since 8am 🙃
Jaw clenching/teeth grinding 
Extreme joint pain

Difficulty breathing- more like anxiety based not like physical
Suicidal ideation-I have no intention of harming myself but I keep thinking how much it easier it would be if I would just OD

Pretty much it’s all the regular run of the mill withdrawal shit i guess. It’s just feels so much more extreme than any other time.

2021-10-27 07:08:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/qgu6rm/my_addiction_has_ruined_my_relationship/,My Addiction Has Ruined My Relationship," Hi everyone. My name is Joshua. I'm 18 and I've had a porn addiction developed since I was 11 years old. It's not diagnosed, but all I can say is that it's always been very difficult for me to control and since I was 11, I haven't gone two weeks without stopping. 
 To explain a little bit about myself and how I got here, I'm gonna talk about my family. My parents had always been fighting and arguing as long as I can remember. It started when he began to cheat on my mom. It really affected all of us kids. My sister Michelle is extremely defensive when it  comes to her boyfriend, my sister Ashley tends to go to horrible guys who cheat on her and I don't know where I lie in that. The point is though, ever since I was a little kid, I made a vow to never cheat on my significant other. 
 When I was 11, I started to watch porn. I'm sorry, I know you're not here to listen about an 11 year old watching porn so I'll make it quick. I would watch and masturbate to it everyday. It was normal for me and I wasn't too worried about it. As the years went on, I started to notice signs that I may be addicted. I would masturbate everywhere, not just my home. When I was 15, I started to like this girl. And as things were settling down and she and I began to form a relationship, I didn't stop. It evolved from porn to femdom and findom. I began to enjoy domination and every other extreme kink. I kept convincing myself it was only because I was a teenager. My hormones were over the roof. 
(I'm gonna get into my girlfriend, and it'll be a lot of how I met her and how I feel about her. I just want you all to understand how much getting better means to me)
 A year later, at 16 years old, I met my current girlfriend. (Ex I guess). At first, I hadn't taken her seriously. To me, she was only someone I'd sext every so often. One day a guy kept calling her and she texted me about it. She was uncomfortable and I told her to just call me so that he can't call her anymore. So we did call, and every night since then we'd call. I didn't think much of it to be honest, or so I thought. One day my phone broke. I was devastated, I couldn't call her anymore. I almost cried until I finally found that I could call her through my laptop. To this day, I don't know why I was so emotional. I had only been talking to her for a few days. 
 A year went by until we finally met. I fell in love with her. She was beautiful in absolutely everyway (still is lol). Then, another year went by. We weren't far from three years until recently. I love her so much. She's helped me with everything. She's probably the most perfect person I've met. She's the kindest, most supportive, positive person ever. 
 Recently I've been almost cheating on her with these findom people. She knew about my addiction and about these incidents. Today, I finally broke. I told her we had to break up because if I stay with her, I'd cheat on her. I'd hurt her. We broke up, and I texted a findomme. I gave her some money.
 This is the aftermath. I don't think I can get her back ofc, but I can at least try my hardest to fix this for her. That's what she'd want. Maybe after falling all the way down, I can climb up somehow. The reason for this post was, how can I fix this addiction. I've tried forums, masturbation counters, and I can't afford therapy at the moment. Please, what can I do?",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.52773654}"

But for the last six months I've been actually listening and applying myself. Now I'm in this 30-60-70 day loop of hell. I've had 5 or 6 relapses since then. But this is the most manipulative person I've ever been. I do door to door sales, and my dad lets me use his car since I've been passing drug tests and finally got my license. I picked up last friday, and right now I'm sitting in my dads car with a pookie and 9 syringes. I have a great sponsor who I'm friends with, a home group, and a beautiful house. This self sabotage bullshit is getting old. 
Yet, at night I watch myself literally slip into a paranoid psychosis from the meth and I'm destroying most of my arm and becoming physically dependant on heroin in the meantime. I know how destructive my disease is yet I still hurt myself and everything in my path. I convinced myself once again that I wasn't done, and now I'm probably going to rehab #10 by the end of the week. I can't look at myself in the mirror, I've reached that shitty feeling where you don't want to get high but you don't want to take responsibility. Nothing hurts more than that spiritual bankruptcy: knowing how many people love me, pray for me, and attempt to help me, but i know if they try to stop me I'll burn that bridge real quick. 
Just now I went to a work bowling thing, and I was so tweaked out I had to physically think about what I was going to say.

When you get sick and tired of being sick and tired, the next level APPEARS: “the t-break, level 1”...

This 1 simple trick I use to feel 75% different in just 5 days time!I dare you! 
Start writing down your negative symptoms of daily use:
Okay now start telling yourself “I’m about to feel better”
Okay, remember its all a numbers game: 
Go from 5 sessions a day 
to 
4 sessions a day
 (every 2 days)...
Nice! Okay! you’re making PROGRESS!!
Ok.. When ready, try 1 less session...
*borat voice: 
VERY NICE, I LIKE!”

Now the next 2 days it’s time bring the % down! 

If it’s vodka, now it’s beer. If it’s nicotine 20, now it’s 15. Thc 60? Now find some 30?
300 milligrams? Try 120
Get the point?

And every few days, keep walking down deez stairs of strength... NOW YOU HAVE THE POWER!

Eventually the urge disappears! 

STRENGTH! 

(You got this!)

Summary:
 #1 do it less often, #2 do it less strong, #3 give it time. 
= urge GONE, no withdrawal.

He responds and says ""its a mess up there you really don't want to go up there"" i don't know why i was missing it all but i respond and say ""that's ok i know she's messy"" that's when he looked at me and said ""so unfortunately they are deceased"" and that was the first time since being a child that i could not control my tears and the ugly look on my face from crying so hard. so i then have to call my mom and tell everyone (im 19) so ofc my whole shit family shows up. the ones that put her in that position to live where she was , the ones that were at fault for her being on probation in the first place, and the ones that tormented her, her whole childhood.  I immediately am furious and telling the police officers that they need to leave and they are not family. and i know that's harsh and its maybe even unfair. but they didnt care about how anyone was doing before that, they didnt care that she got raped in jail (after being forced to stay with the men because of birth gender) after they sent her there. i then watch them carry her out and have to go upstairs to collect belongings such as id ssn phone etc. it was awful and the entire time i felt completely alone i had to pick her phone out of the pile of blood she was laying in. i got into the car and had to take as much of my clothes off as i could because they all reeked of death. then i go home ... where its even worse.. if i cry about it if i mention it if i ever try to talk about how much im hurting from it, it starts a whole thing with my mom she starts sobbing and talking about how much SHES hurting, i get it ok and i didnt cry or bring up anything to upset her for a full month after i just listened and tried to be there for her. she has never once asked me how dealing with / witnessing the entire thing made me feel. she never asked how me having to tell everyone that she was dead affected me. im the only one who kept in contact with her. im the one who got her out of jail by myself. every single day it feels like im alone now my other siblings are from a new marriage, so theyre much younger. the official cause of death was od of fentanyl. i wish so bad that i could go back and be present for the phone call and listen to her talk about her day. since shes been gone at first i was terrified to touch anything because i was scared if i died how it would affect my mom. but im at the point where im so exhausted of no one caring or asking how im doing. i am alone the only person who even celebrated for her on her birthday and for one year gone. its like im the only one who feels incomplete. anyways recently i went a little overboard  while hanging out with my friends and woke up and physically couldnt breath it felt like my lungs truly werent working and i woke up out of my sleep at 4am and curled over on the ground trying to breathe. i dont know how i feel about any of it or what i want to do about any of it i just so badly needed to say it all.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.861992}"

im a drug addict, i want to write a memoir, not because i think I'm special, i'm just stupid and have lots of stories that make people laugh of me being very stupid,,, and stryggle with mental health and personally 2 things make me feel better, knowing that pyschosis ends and laughing at my pyschosis, if i write a book it wont be some deep exploration of human suffering but hopefully a little distraction from the bleakness of drug addiction.. maybe i wont ever get clean but fuck im already dead if i lose my sense of humor

turning 30 came with the weight of a few things, looks fade... im a loser by societies standards, its like the 5th time i've had to move back in with dad and im not quirky or cool in a weird way or weird in a cool way i'm actually crazy.. and already disadvantaged, basically disabled, and the fucking heartless gangstalkers want to make me more crazy and less rehabilitatable and more deranged and less likely to recover and more untreatable and get me voted less likely to succeed by rehab classs of 2022, gangstalking shits are making me the unpalatable crazy that when a hot girl is like omg im so crazy is calling herself a crazy that is a universe away from the flavor of crazy my ass has been dipped in.. (i used to think it was the hot girl crazy they meant when they screamed crazy bitch but no man thats ever REALLY gotten to know me has used the word crazy unless it was like elly,  you crazy bitch, your life is a mess, you live in a self deluded nonsense world, its not always your parents fault, their obvious and possible faults in parenting will never explain away the strange and disturbing anomaly that is you and your wreckage of a life, instead of accomplishments and success ur life map is a list of people to avoid that you owe money too, the scary ones highlighted......if your shittness as a human was caused by childhood trauma your dad would have to be a more rapey  john wayne gacey who was always evil clown version and your mom would have to be a rabid sewer demon who got life from getting babies addicted to crack and your parents love you so their mistakes aren't the evil doings u tell urself but normal and boring human error, no motives were nefarious just whole hearted attempts at raising a mini demon, easier the demon child but their luck was short and full blown mini demon god gavith, you are just not a good person. sobering words that hurt coming from your loser crackhead bf who wanted to live in your dads basement forever and still shit himself and acted like that wasnt a gross rare surprise, shitty pants was like a norm for him but still could read your character without shame.

 i got the crazy that isn't hot and the gangstalkers know im 30 and just love that im becoming less valuable and wanted by society every second and the more crazy they make me the less likley ill ever procreate, their plan all along, i think, theories change and the general consensus is.... confused and very paranoid about handing in the census forms ... but this book will mostly be about me and not them (Im unsure if they are here to stay or if they are just the form my obsession will be taking the next few years, i like it better then constantly worrying ive contracted hiv and coping with the stress of living with a life changing disease by engaging in impulsive reckless behavior that is how people get these infectious diseases, and obsessing about whatever reckless thing i did to cope that gave me the virus, i spent 8 years in that cycle until my mom got so tired of listening to me whine about my disease without getting tested she bribed me, with drugs and lukily im negative so i worry less, cancer took whatever space left by the hiv, i have a few types and so does my family) i doubt ill ever find love but just give me the babies, i was so good when i had to look after my dog. i should probably just become a crazy dog lady and realize im destined for the singlelife... yes im awesome but im the type of incredible that isn't really understood, i'm like that rare coin only two people know about, the two people know its the best coin ever and the fact they stopped production after one batch because what was meant to be a lady with a dove behind her ended up looking like an evil demon hooker giving an ostrich a blowjob...hell love me for not in spite of all my wasted life and privilege and opportunity, he will say, wow, she rather suffer then overcome her own self absorbed hell.... he will be wrong, im just very lazy but still he will love me and when his freinds ask why..... instead of the usual shes hot that im sure was used before he will get creative because im over 30 now and cant get love cuffed, i dont havve looks to fall back on. this change in decade is making me care that im like not wanted by the oposite sex, i was never above it all, i just was still young and attractive, 25 and drug addicted can still be a layer, a multi faceted complex person with layers, shes an artist, shes a nutjob, methhead, heroin junkie, what made me interesting in my 20s makes me a sad old hag at 30. i used to laugh that i've had guys that promised to look after me runnn away!!!! from me an hour later  now i feel like i should stop telling that story and maybe my laughter waas so loud i didnt hear that my laugh was the only one and i just made people sad with that story...... poor old lady want love but only find run boy run (that role must be played by an old chineaese lady.. not anyother asian but chinease, if you cant tell the difference your just an unccultured swine.. never let them call you raacist just culturally stupid) Ii never ask for a protector but keep having it offered to me like i present as an overgrown child that needs to have their drivers license permanently revoked or maybe its just as simple as my clothes always being either inside out or backwards or both, (i feel like this is only something heroin addicts do, im like when im not dopesick i will fix my clothes and then im high and dont care i look like im speciial needs anymore) anyways my point is these people are mean.. the type of crazy they wanted to drive me was TOTALLY UNRELATABLE AND ISOLATING AND MY DAD HAD TO HIDE HIS GOLFCLUBS CRAZY BECAUSE SO MANY CARS WITH SO MANY WINDSHIELDS NEEDED TO BE smashed. my mental health has already made me a loner, depression, anxiety, paranoia and a bad meth psychosis every few months means not many people are patient enough. but their plan back fired because  my neutral was their end game..... i found a glitch in their gangs talking matix. the crazy is already the crazy, when you fell over the edge you cant really fall more, obsessions and delusions can change, my twenties i spent obsessing about hiv, i thought everybody i slept with gave me hiv and would spend ALL my time looking up symptoms, get drunk to relieve my anxiety, have unprotected sex because i was drunk, then spend all my time obsessing that the guy i fucked gave me hiv and what i wouldn't give to go back in time before i slept with that guy, that cycle still happens but literally ruled my life for at least 6 years. now im being followed, im still obsessing to a point that is all consuming and rules my life but inside of aids being the villain its gangstalkers.... i get to take a  blood test when i start obsessing to reassure myself im not being slowly ravaged by a virus now i use other peoples perception as a test, but it can be really annoying, my dads sigh is so sad and defeated when i mention the gangstalkers, i literally hear life leave his body when im explaining how something is not normal its a nefarious fakery of normal so we think everything is okay but im literally being poisoned by them, i almost died from sepsis not because im a junkie... duuhh it was the drugs they put all over the ground, they broke into your house dad! and knew that i carpet surf so they put poison on the ground, they hack the cameras thats how they can break in without being detected, why? i have my theories but this guy i almost smashed with a skateboard for following me was actually a regular guy who has also been the victim of gangstalking and he says its freemasons that hate drug useres, so idk they put drugs on your basemnt floor, oh ya to poison me.....honestly the gangstalking is meant to be my nightmare but literally the shit my poor parents have been  forced to live threw, their suffering should be monetarily compensated, like at least pay them for the hours of free babysitting i recieved, my dad is a hero, the only thing between me and my golfclub and probably mostly innocent people (some HAd to obe gangstalkers), was him. this man drove me around for hours because i said we couldn't let them see where we lived, he simultaneously though i was psychotic while he obeyed my insane pleads.  my saint of a mother also drove me around in my most unsociable state to make sure i felt safe, constantly reassuring me she had a bat in the backseat, when i reached back for the weapon i needed to protect me and my mom.. i wasn't holding the tool many before chose as their prefered kill method, this bat wasnt going to land me a murder in first 2nd 3rd. no manslaughter,i couldn't be charged because i wasnt fit to stand trial, and my red plastic toy bat wouldnt get me that far anywyas... her promise that yes a weapon existed to keep us safe was literally her just buying time in crazy land, buying time in crazy land isnt like normal land, i still jumped out of that car to kill those people, that may or may not but probably weren't and just totally innocents people not following usat all, i still walked over to them, crazy lady like, my energy was like some rabid fever, anybody who dared eye contact with me was hit with a siickness manifested by my creepy intensity, my company was an uneasy presense not of something with evil motives but i was more dangerous with delusions of all the evil outside of myself.  my hair was the obvious result of a ferile drug binge, , a life lived in the dark, your pagan god the sewage king that you worship also had 4 commandments, steal, cheat; lie and kill, i looked like somebody's whose mantra was a homicidal fantasy, it didnt matter wether they saw the plastic red bat in my hand or not, my grin was vibrating and uncanny and next level creepy.... i hate the police but honeslty i dont blame them for getting me arrested, i would be scared too. countless moments where sanity brushed my shoulder, not a nudge just a gental reminder, take it easy, its okay to act like you will kill somebody but dont cross a line that you cant cross back... smashining in some innocent perpersons head with a scateboard wont be a funny story. hundreds od probably, maybe, innocent people i verbally abused, i stalked people i thought were following me, one was a kid, he said dont hurt me...its scarryy that me, a non violentt person was so ready to end somebodies life.... for the very evil crime of following, jury is out on gangstalking, real or not, i need a few more years playing investigative journalist before i share what i know....regardless to fucking murk some poor fool without even employing occam's razor is super selfish... which i am but lets all keep a check on ourselves, if i can let my self deluded reasoning turn homicidal anyone  can. and with my luck i would have killed anybody but my gangstalkers, 3 innocent children but didnt see the man in black with an ear mic and gangstalking app.

I hope this text can help any current addicts or previous addicts. If you have any feedback let me know by commenting or messaging me personally.,"1 in 8 adults suffers from addiction. Addiction is a chronic disease that troubles many Americans. Addiction can come from the environment or biology you are set in. Addiction is a disease that needs medical treatment. I’m looking to change the conversation of addiction and change lives like mine to change and recover from their addictions.

Addiction is a problem-plagued by companies aggressively marketing their products and starting problems for people. Addiction is a problem that nobody can predict. Anyone can get addicted or be addicted to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, sex, video games, and gambling. Pharmaceutical companies aggressively market their products to governments and people. Although, pharmaceutical companies are not the only ones to blame. Alcohol and tobacco companies are both legal substances in America and many places around the globe. These companies over-market these products to people that are already suffering from the addiction itself. They use user-based ad targeting to worsen people's lives by targeting them with ads that want them to continue their addiction, which in my opinion, is wrong. 5 years ago, my mother was prescribed 30 Percocet for tooth surgery. A tooth surgery, and 30 Percocet. That is unbelievable that doctors can prescribe something so small as an unhealthy dose of Percocet. Addiction has plagued America, and someone needs to end the addiction battle that many Americans suffer from.

Addiction is not a choice; it is a problem created through people's goals and desires. People can find themselves taking opioids through something as simple as a car accident and then lead to something even worse, such as heroin. This happens through people not understanding opioids and their power over your body. Opioids can make you feel outstanding but make you wish you could feel more. Addiction is not just something you can fix in one day, as I have found through testing and interviewing different previous addicts and current addicts. Relapsing is a prevalent incident throughout the country. Relapsing can happen through addicts wanting to recover, but they are still around the same people that brought them into the problem or supported it. Relapsing can also occur through the brain not feeling dopamine like they did when they were on the substance that became addicted. Addiction is not something to be taken lightly and is a problem that needs to be fixed rigorously and through listening to people's stories and understanding where the problem lies in the first place and why they keep doing it. Motivation and taking every step carefully is essential for an addict to feel good about themselves and turn their lives around. Nearly 841,000 people have died from drug overdose since 1999, and almost 75,000 people died from an overdose in 2019 alone. Not only that, over 600,000 people had been killed from tobacco or alcohol alone in 2019. That is a problem. Over 700,000 people lost their lives to addiction in 2019, and no one should stand for that.

Addicts believe that they have invincibility from these problems. The invincibility fable is a type of thought pattern that is noted most frequently in teenagers. It is a selfish way of thinking. A belief in indestructibility characterizes that they believe that they won't get caught when doing wrong and won't be hurt (or killed) by engaging in risky behaviors. That is another big problem. Over 10,000 teens alone have died this year from alcohol, drugs, or nicotine. The invincibility fable is when teens believe that, “Oh, that can happen to someone else, but never me.” Although that is a wrong way to think about the addiction they are suffering from. The invincibility fable is another big problem in America, and people should not take addiction lightly.

Some people believe that addiction lies in the hands of the addict and that it is all their fault that they put themselves in that position. Though many studies say otherwise, a study from New York concluded that addiction is a problem that lies through the addict's environment and desires. Addiction is a problem many Americans suffer from, and that’s why I am here to help. Treatment has become a very popular thing throughout the country. Treating addiction can be found through counseling groups such as AA, MAT, SAMHSA, and many others. Treatment can also be found in medical counseling and staying in a place to feel environmentally safe and learn how to battle their addictions. Although treatment can be at fault for costing $6000 - $100,000 for 30 days of treatment, most addicts and normal citizens cannot afford it. Is treatment at fault, though? Only 43% of people that make it out of treatment succeed in not relapsing or suffering from other addictions. 16% of people that get out of rehab find themselves in rehab later in their lives because they relapse off the same substance that landed them there or finds happiness in different substances.

Fear-mongering is where most anti-drug campaigns resort to when they want to help someone fix their addiction. That is a bad problem because most people can see through the BS, and studies have also found that fear-mongering can lead to people becoming interested in the problem they are trying to end. I want to change the conversation to help people learn what substances do and why they are bad for anyone's health. I think people understanding the substance they can get themselves into and learning why it is helpful for many people who don’t know what they could be getting into. I fell to this myself by not understanding what alcohol, drugs, or nicotine can do to a person. If I would’ve known what I was getting myself into, I could’ve stopped myself from becoming an addict myself, and I’m sure many other people feel the same way. I believe teaching people about substances and why they are wrong is essential to people who might become an addict or desire to become an addict. 

I want to create something for addicts to trust after rehab, not relapse or find happiness in other substances. I want to create a product that can help recovering addicts stay out of addictive substances or help addicts get better from the addiction they are suffering from. Fear-mongering is a problem that most anti-drug campaigns fall into, which is not what this product is for. I want my product to help the 1 out of 8 adults suffering from addictions in America. I think that product is assisting people in learning and understanding what they could get themselves into or helping people understand what they are addicted to. If schools, advertisements, and people focus more on understanding the problem instead of lying about substances, it can help people stay away from substances. The biggest problem with addiction is ignorance, so if people changed the conversation, people could not become addicted, look for help, and become healthier.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.84854066}"

My advice for the still sick and suffering, set a goal. Pick something that you want in life or something you want to change in your own life and go get it. Keep working towards the objective. You don’t have to be a spiritual person but you must find a way to be hopeful. Hope for that change. Work towards that change. Always. Without ceasing. Eyes straight ahead.

I’m not the sort of person who spends time in places where I could find myself a new dealer (kind of stumbed onto the last one).

After that year off I got back into casual use that was pretty well controlled, mainly because I had no dealer of my own. I only used with one particular person and he always supplied. We’d get together every couple of months and have a fun night. That has worked for a number of years. 

Fast forward to now. I once again have a connection I can buy from. I don’t want to go down the same path as before but I also don’t really want to quit.

We've tried every intervention and rehab we could, and nothing worked. We didn't realise we were enabling her behavior (via financial support) until it was far too late, and at this point there's not much of her left. She doesn't exist outside of her addiction, and any time she takes a step out of it, she regresses within days, even hours. We can't have her stay with us because she trashes the house and is always trying to argue with us. She has her own flat which we bought for her after she got out of rehab for the first time, but if we leave her there for longer than a few days it will end up in a state that borders on unliveable. I just don't know what we can do. We've been there for her the whole time and the only effect that we've had is that she feels safe continuing to do it because no matter what, we're her safety net. Neither of my parents want to abandon her, obviously, but at this point I'm so tired and I don't know if there's anything left for us to try. Her entire life revolves around alcohol and she can't get a job (when she had one in the past, she abandoned it in order to drink) or try out any hobbies because all she wants to do is drink all the time. At times it feels like her brain is gone, she sees us only as a way to get more alcohol, same goes for any friends she has left (people who live in her apartment block, but mostly people she meets in bars), and often she'll say things that don't make sense even when she's sober because she can't focus on anything anymore.

&#x200B;

I know we can't support her actions, but we could never just leave her to her own devices because she would die. I'm just so fucking tired and angry, I can't focus on my work because every week there's something new and we find out she's in hospital again. I'm so sick of having to take care of her because she's in withdrawal after she comes home for a day, only drinking a bottle of wine or two. My life has been turned upside down constantly because of her.

There was nowhere else I could really post this. Nobody seems to have advice for cases as bad as hers.

I’m scared because I know how depressed and miserable I’m going to feel for the next few weeks. I take antidepressants every day which honestly makes somewhat of a difference in the severity of my comedowns. I always thought it was normal to literally want to fucking die the day after doing blow, but once I started taking antidepressants I only felt a little tired and moody for a few days after. This gives me hope, because I “quit” about 6 months ago before I was medicated and I had the worst couple months of my life. I relapsed about a month and a half ago, and i’m hoping the antidepressants will make this a little less hellish of an experience. 

My friend and I want to quit together. We came up with the idea that we could snot adderall at parties to curb any cravings for coke.

I'm new here and in many subs I just post. Maybe I am not properly socialized, I hope this will Garner some responses, but what I feel like I'm doing is just talking, and who wants to read that. Maybe it gets taken down for not following how a post here should be. But most likely it will probably just be forgotten.

Some context, I started using again after my mother died, tbh worst timing but addiction is if nothing selvfish and self centered. I have now effectively distanced my family. My brother does not talk to me, my sister does tough. And my father will no longer let me stay at him because I burned told many bridges, I know he goes to a ""next of kin""of those who suffer from addiction workshops,  and I'm thinking either he's just smart or learning how not to be a co-dependandt? If i understand what that term means it's about people with relationships that enable an addict to continue using, as far as I know. So he did not offer me sanctuary, for the first time, and that made me feel so incredible on my own, like truly, alone. Maybe it should have happened a long time ago.. sink or swim baby, atleast that's how it feels. Maybe I'll thank him some day for doing it. Maybe I needed not to have a safe space to crawl into when things get too dicey. He cut me loose.

 But right now what an I gonna do?
I wanna yell at him, scream at him, but I'm. Pretty sure that's wrong. I can't be a little boy to my father forever. 

I have no friends, no job. My family cares about me, but as long as I'm using they want nothing to do with me, or as little as possible. Man, I'm just realizing to my brother I am pretty much already dead to him. All that shame I carry, it's such a heavy burden, can someone show me how to lift it, please?

I just pray I will make it to that meeting tomorrow. Just wanted to say really glad you are all here, being here for people like me. Thank you.

Hey my name is ________ I enjoy making music on my laptop that I had, I loved the very first love of my life that I had, I also was in love with skateboarding that I had, I loved to run when I was ever upset or when I was ever frustrated, I also loved the friends I could always hangout with and passed the time with… I also and finally loved living with my mother and step father who gave and did more for for me than they could at the time but I lost all of that. The morale of this note is I had these things but I threw it all away for meth. I ruined everything my parents and friends gave me to succeed and be a good person. Including my health. I do not regret my time spent learning but I do regret my actions. I wish that everyone who ever considers or is continuing to use drugs to never do it again. It will strip away and take away everything you own and will slowly but surely make you lose your mind no matter who you are… Don’t do it. Please never do it and or quit while you can. It isn’t fun or even an outlet away from whoever’s problems. It will hurt everyone including yourself. Meth is a plague that’s rapidly destroying, decaying, and sickening this planet. I’m not here to preach but I am here to warn all of you to not ever do this awful drug… As of writing this I am high on this evil right now. It only brings pain and deception towards all. It almost killed me by the people and environment I surround myself in. GET HELP PLEASE it’s never too late. YOU are cared and loved by my heart and soul. Do better for yourself.

I quit and shortly after,  met my husband.  He asked me to do meth with him and I jumped on it. We were addicts together for almost a year. I quit the day I found out I was pregnant. He quit when our son was 3 months old (he's almost 18 now)because I threatened to leave him if he didn't 

Several years went by without any drugs.  Then, recreational drug use was reintroduced by him. I was weak. While it was never my idea to do drugs,  I always said yes.  I had lots of reasons to say no but would just give in.  Mushrooms, ecstasy, Molly, and coke. We would do drugs when we went to a concert or just hanging out at home.  It didn't seem to be a huge problem and sometimes it was fun.  

This increased during COVID because there just wasn't much to do. In February of this year,  my husband discovered I had cheated on him about 3 years ago. As a coping mechanism,  he began using an extreme amount of drugs and quit working.  He became extremely aggressive, paranoid, and emotional. He began using meth again.  This significantly complicated reconciliation.  

His drug use ultimately resulted in him getting arrested and earning a felony domestic violence charge a couple of weeks ago.  I have not used any drugs since May and have no intentions of using ever again.  To my knowledge,  he hasn't used since he was arrested.  

Yesterday,  he told me he has Molly and thinks we should do it together to help us reconnect.  96% of my brain tells me HELLLLL NOOOOOOO!!!! Why the hell would he be suggesting we use drugs???? This is the worst possible plan to help with reconciliation. If I were to say yes to that it would seem as though I  was ok with him using drugs.  At times when I have agreed to  join him,  he uses it against me to say,  ""how come it's ok to use drugs when you're ok with it but I can't on my own"". He's right I suppose but even if occasional recreational use was ok with me... he can't handle that. If I was ok with partying for one night,  he binges for 5. He doesn't just buy enough to last for one night... he buys enough for a week. I would never seek out drugs. I don't know anywhere to buy drugs. If not for him, the idea would never cross my mind. 

The other 4% of my brain tells me to do it. Maybe it would help us reconnect.  Our sex life has been nonexistent for months.  We have always connected extremely well with Molly in the past.  Like therapeutically,  it might be good for us. 

I'm not going to do Molly with him. I'm glad that 96% of my brain knows better. It's very difficult to be living with someone who continues bringing drugs into our lives. 

I wish we could connect by holding hands while walking somewhere,  cuddling while watching a movie,  cooking a meal together, going for a drive,  or sending love texts to each other. It's like these things just aren't an option.  

We've both put each other through hell.  Me by cheating and him by choosing meth as a way to cope with it. So much damage has been done.  He tells me to just ""be happy"" and I can't find my happy anymore.  I can't even drink 2 cocktails without getting sad and then angry.

By that time, i had a pretty normal life and had no problems with addiction at all. I started taking Ritalin before the pandemic, but still it wasn't a problem, at the time i had a boyfriend, spent most of the day in college, used to go to parties, meet new people and felt good about it. In other words, i kinda had no time to be addicted, despite the colossal potential being known since ever, and the most important of all, i was one of the best students of my class, studied free time, researched about lots of stuff and everyone said i was ""smart as f*ck"" and i also went to gym regularly. 

Then the pandemic began

Initially, it was just like a break, but as depression, anxiety, loneliness and fatigue got up to me and everyone, i began taking Alprazolam more than prescribed, using Ritalin became recreational, then i went to Concerta, then Vyvanse and the effects of it all were, long term, the opposite of what they should be. I began feeling **dumb**, stopped reading, stopped listening to music, stopped writing, studying and gained a lot of weight. Everything went only downhill, but coincidentally, those hard times and severe problems only rose with the lockdown. If i'm out of meds, i eat too much and can't sleep. If i'm with something for anxiety, it mildly holds compulsion. If i'm with Alprazolam, it's like my brain melts, i go from dumb to dumber to dumbest as time went on, but on the other hand, *i need to sleep at night*. 

As I've said before in here, i have no problem just dropping off any of my meds, it's as simple as saying ""nah, i won't take it"". I do go through withdrawal, but i endure and face it to the end, no cravings and never had a relapse, but with all my problems (yes, i go to therapy and a psychiatrist regularly and improvements have been achieved) i can't ***live*** ""clean"", without anything. Not that i beg for meds, but when I'm with nothing as treatment, i eat like a pig, go 2 to 3 nights straight looking at the sealing unable to sleep and (at least at home) can't read 3 pages of something without getting anxious. This is a problem to be solved with time and treatment, but as for all addicted actions, every bad decision, is it related to the reality of the pandemic? Meaning that when things go back to normal, overcoming my problems will be at least a little easier?",6,"{'pandemic': 3, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46431956}"

I have been reading reddit posts about quitting marijuana, but my situation seems to be different than most. 

I first began using marijuana about 4 years ago, as a way to quit drinking alcohol. It worked wonders, honestly & I am happy to say that I no longer abuse alcohol. 

With marijuana, I pulled my life together. I got very interested in self education, particularly in Philosophy, but science & history as well. Also, I managed to pay off all of my debt & save up for a house. This year I bought that house.. I've also managed to teach myself guitar, I've read 36 books so far, written 120,000 words, I exercise 4 times a week & I feel like I am a more engaged father - the point I'm trying to make, is that marijuana has become the source of my productivity. When I try to quit, I don't feel like writing, the guitar feels too complicated, I lose my reading comprehension & I just feel bored & like shit. 

I don't want to be dependent on a substance, but without it, I just don't have the drive to pursue my passions, I'm irritated, & I just feel generally unfulfilled. Whereas when I smoke, I am very proud of the progress I've made. It feels meaningless without that drug. 

I do use medical marijuana, and it certainly can be beneficial to my mental health at times, but can just as easily be prohibiting. 

When I read other posts on reddit, I often see that a perk to sobriety is that you find a drive to try new things & work on projects... it is just opposite for me. I have never had this much motivation in life until I began my journey with marijuana. I feel like ""I've got the message, time to hang up"" - but I lose my creative edge without it. Part of me thinks that perhaps I am just better off sticking to the marijuana, while the other half is begging for independence",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41650435}"

A moderator answered that I shouldn't be there. They are not a zoo he said. And I got permanently banned from the heroin reddit.

I thought that my curiosity toward addiction was something positive: a way to empathize with a shunned minory. But after the reaction of the heroin moderator I'm having an afterthought.

When sober I am completely non confrontational, highly agreeable and empathetic. Since the age of about 18, when I started drinking more frequently, I’d randomly experience blackouts where I’d act like a literal psychopath. Sometimes when I drink I’m super happy and social. Other nights I’ll start out happy and the next minute get super upset. It’s like there’s a certain point where a switch is flipped in my brain and I get hyper aggressive, run away from my friends, go on a rampage, etc. It’s hard to know when my mood will change because there isn’t a clear pattern and blackouts come over me quickly. Once I’m at that level I have absolutely zero control of my intake or behavior. I don’t have a dependency on alcohol where I have to drink and I never drink on my own. It’s just the random social events where I decide to drink that this happens.

It’s to the point where I’ve been arrested multiple times, punched a friend, and tried to provoking men to fight me(I’m a short thin woman that can’t fight).

I was on methadone for years. 5 years. After rehab, prison, homelessness...methadone had me stable, working a good paying job, I even had insurance. Someone started bringing H around me though. Someone close to me. And even though the methadone stopped most of it, I could still feel a slight rush from it, especially after I snuck a rig from a friend with the sugars..after 5 years I started failing drug tests and lost all my take home privileges. Which is like getting fired without getting fired if you work 3rd shift. I've never been able to take my dose after work, go home, and sleep. I always end up staying up chain smoking and sitting on the porch. I always took my methadone at 5 pm. Right before I went to work. And it worked great for me. But now I was being forced to get off from my 12 hrs of warehouse hell, take my methadone,  and futile attempts to sleep afterwards, ending up with me falling asleep at work, walking, driving, crashing into bins...and the person bringing this H around, it's always a factor too. My whole check gone in 2 days..though I know I've bought nothing and I'm getting delinquent payment notices..just living in a dream ..well, nightmare..

She's tired of driving to the clinic everyday. Although it's all she has to do. Period. And H all day. And I have no choice. She's decided she isn't taking me anymore. She got me some suboxon from a Dr who you just talk to on the phone. Gave me some and threw me into the worst withdrawal I have ever experienced. While still doing the H, right next to me. And this is still going on. I am so depressed, so sick all the time...someone high as a kite next to me constantly while I'm trying to switch to a drug I don't like to make her life easier...so I can work and listen to why I'm such a fuck up...

I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD in my late 20s and prescribed adderall. It was a fucking godsend. I had just returned to college for my nursing degree and I actually WANTED to study and go to class. I was finally getting As, I was keeping everything organized, I was doing everything I had wanted to do before but just couldn’t. The lack of motivation and organization that comes with ADHD can be fucking crippling, and I finally felt like a normal person. I got my RN with a GPA of 3. Something, something I never thought I could achieve. And I lost 50lbs, which was an added bonus. 
Within a year or 2 I was full on addicted. I was popping 30mg ERs like candy. My mom got diagnosed shortly after me, since we had basically the same symptoms, and her doc, for some god forsaken reason prescribed her 30 ERs off the bat. So obvs I found creative ways to steal hers when mine were low or gone. It all finally blew up when I was leaving basically empty shells of pills in her bottle and she was getting no effect. She asked me point blank and I said yes, I’m addicted. At first she took my pills and gave me a dose every day as prescribed. I finally took myself off of it all together because I just couldn’t stand the constant need for it, the hours I’d spend looking for my pills or hers, etc. 
I went back to my doc recently and told her point blank, I need something for this cuz I’m finding myself running in circles at work, but it can’t be a stimulant because I like them too much. So she prescribed me Strattera. It’s an SNRI, not technically a stimulant, and it worked well at first but as an addict does, I started abusing that too. God knows why, since it only has the effect of giving me more energy, but the motivation is still lacking. I just straight up love the feeling it gives me. 
I’m on a week and a half long vacation right now, and I asked my SO to get me some addy so I could clean the house because I haven’t been able to get my ass and just do it. 
But ffs, it works so goddamn well!! Combine the addy with strattera, I feel like I could clean and reorganize the house top to bottom and still have energy left over. 
It hasn’t helped being a nurse right now either. We’re so short staffed, I’m basically living at work. Plus I’m a manager, so if someone calls out and there’s no one else to do it I HAVE to stay. (I would never, and have never, stolen drugs from pts fyi). Being almost constantly tired and stressed out does not help addictive behavior. 
 Idk why I’m posting this. I guess just to get it off my chest. I feel like I can’t be a normal human being without meds. Someone who can just do the dishes when they need to be done, or do the laundry and put it away before I run out of underwear. I know people with ADHD have a much higher chance of being an addict, but that doesn’t stop the fact that I’m still super symptomatic when I don’t have meds. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there anything you’ve found that actually helps?

Today the court ordered that my ex has to stay clean from all non prescribed illicit substances for 24 hours before seeing my daughter. This included THC and alcohol and was very clear in court that it was included. 

I agreed to appoint my ex’s mother to be the third party mostly because I know she cares about my daughter and I consider her honest

The problem now is I need a way to prove that she hasn’t taken anything in terms of drugs and alcohol for 24 hours.  This means that the clock starts at 9am tomorrow morning. 

My ex claims to be clean and sober for over a month now so this really shouldn’t be an issue except she is a chronic and pathological liar who cannot be trusted. 

I gave the  supervisor 2 options. They can either stay and supervise her daughter for 24 hours before the visit 
or 
My ex needs to take a drug the day of seeing my daughter (which if she’s clean for a month like she says then it should show nothing. 

I’ve then told them if they cannot confirm they stayed with her or do the test and it comes up all negative then I’ll be keeping my daughter home. 

To me they are choosing just to not put themselves in a position where they would have to tell me the truth….. am I wrong to think this or am I right to think that this was their plan all along. (Now I sound paranoid) lol",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5895481}"

I wanted to get some advice tho because sometimes its hard for my to be honest in meetings (especially old school type meetings). Im 20 years old and I have being in and out of AA and NA since I was 15. There have been times where it sticks and times where it hasn't. Currently I'm 235 days clean off of fentanyl and herion, my drugs of choice. But I have dabbled In psychedelics and weed occasionally but not consistently. I had one of the most spatial experiences of my life off up mushrooms about a month ago and it really made me reflect on my life. I guess what I'm try to say is I have a lot of these ""AA ideas"" stuck in my head and they make me feel like I'm a piece of shit. However I've been doing better in life than I ever have from the outside looking in. Ive been working my ass off for the past 7 months and bought a car and I'm looking to move out of this sober living, but I still have this guilt that I feel that was put on me in AA. Im not nessilary asking for advice but I would take some. What are your views about things about being sober? Do I have to be completely sober off of everything this known to man? is it about changing the mindset? or are many cases different?

He told me that he uses it for sex and that he’s been hooking up with men just to use the drug more so than the potential romance. He also admitted he had a problem and he didn’t know what to do. He said it so casually, which I found disturbing. It was like it was totally normal to have a drug problem and or use meth. Typically I would offer advice but I had none so I just listened to him talk as we walked to our destination. Our friendship has shifted in recent time where he’s become less of a good friend. He’s often unreliable and not emotionally available. It’s sort of like talking to someone with tunnel vision. He also has a lot of relationship issues, like A LOT. Sometimes I feel like he’s just not there anymore. But all of this makes sense now with the drug use. I don’t know how to help him. I’ve never dealt with anyone addicted drugs and don’t know where to begin to help him. Like I said he’s admitted that he has a problem, he even admitted to being a bad friend. He says he needs help and doesn’t know what to do. But at the same time he said that very casually and I don’t know how serious he is about it.

However, they recently shared with me that they abuse drugs. It's the only way they could medicate for their severe and very difficult to manage mental illness in the past, as the psychiatrists where they grew up did not offer Blue the proper help they deserved. They told me it's the only way they can function.
They would not tell me their drugs of choice but I know it's most likely benzos and opioids.

I had to leave them after learning that. My therapist and family told me I did the right thing for my own wellbeing but I can't stop feeling sick.

It feels like I can't get enough of it. I can't really recall when I started to have this addiction but I'm sure it was around 4th grade or 5th grade when I got my first iPod. I'm a senior now. 

I can't function without my phone and now it's starting to take its toll. I can't go to sleep without an ASMR video. I can't cook without putting some videos on. I can't clean dishes without my phone. Even reading and homework, there has to be something there. I can go an hour and a half without my phone during classes or at a  family outing or conversation but that's about it. And sometimes when I'm in conversation, I feel a bit anxious if I'll have enough time for my phone when I know I have something afterwards and I sometimes avoid people because of my phone. I also do take care of myself but only the bare minimum. ( my hair is brushed but still a bit messy and I never had the desire to dress really well)

I have realized that the internet is a drug to me. I know it's bad for me but I don't stop. It feels like I can't stop. I've attempted to stop a lot of times but I always give into the craving. So even on days when I declare that I'm gonna change, I don't truly believe myself so I revert within a few days, if not the next day. So I'm mentally given up. Even my dad doesn't believe me and says I never will change which I get but it doesn't really help.

 I think I might ( MIGHT, this is not official yet) have depression or something along the lines and I'm not sure if I have the addiction because I'm depressed, or if I'm depressed because I have the addiction. But the internet has been a comfort to me. When I'm anxious and feel ashamed or upset, I scroll on my recommended. And I think I have depression because:

1. I'm boring. I only really find myself funny or entertaining when I'm joking about YouTube videos or in conversation.

2. I don't really have any goals. I mean I have one here and there, but they never stick. I had some goals about going to Columbia University, but then I became disinterested and now I'm just going to a community  College ( which is not a bad thing, it's just significant). 

3. Probably one of the main reasons for number 2 is that I don't really have talent. The two things that Im skilled in is playing with my sister and conceptualizing  plot lines. I can't write tho and I don't want to deal with kids that often in my career, so there's nothing I want to improve in.

4. I don't see a future. I'm lack confidence and I complicate things a lot. Even small things like three times, I couldn't open a door because I was doing it wrong. My dad tells me I'm the type of girl to be prostituted and ran over by guys and I believe him. So he said I better find a strong friend to help me or a strong husband. So I worry that I'm not gonna be lucky with my first friend outside of school or my first bf and I'll be sucidial ( I'm not by the way, I just worry that I might end up like that), prostituted or something else. And then my childern would probably hate me.

5. I'm not what I want my kids to be. Nor am I the woman that I want a good guy to marry. I mean who wants to be with a  lazy and confused woman who can't do things without her phone with no goals or anything. I'm naturally beautiful physically which is what I expect in a man, but I also want someone who is fun even when times get bad and has their own life. But I don't have that, so I would be a hypocrite so I will feel terrible expecting that in a man when I can't do it myself. I'm scared that I'll find a bf but since I'm frustrating to deal with and hypocritical, they would break up with me and then I'd never find anyone I actually like. And obviously, I would never want my kids to inherit my ideas. I don't even want to parent as much so they can be better than me, and I don't want to mess up their future. I want them to be confident and very hard working but I'll never be that so I would rather have them be  someone strong rather than me. But I still want to be involved enough to be there, just not to the point where they see me as a role model.

So the internet is the perfect escape for me at least. It's easy to access and you can see anything entertaining. It's like I'm living to be entertained at this point. I want to  be able to enjoy my youth and my last year of High School but this addiction is gonna ruin it for me. I usually have a 95 average in grades but I'm below 50 in some subjects because I choose entertainment over homework. I even had to drop out a class and I might not even graduate if I don't pull my grades up. So I'm stuck in this addiction and I feel like I can't do anything about it.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6219026}"

I do have a terrible compulsion with medications, lots of them, but never to the point of overdose or anything. It's always between higher than prescribed to little less than overdosing. It still abuse either way, and i do have problems holding myself not to take anything. Be it meds, alcohol, food... You name it (never tried drugs, so i don't know). The thing is... When i truly decide to stop it, i just stop it. Withdrawal? Sure, it happens and it's often terrible, but it never made me tempted to go back to the drug, actually nothing does, only my insecurity of not being able to handle everything that keeps me going beyond what i should. 

Sometimes, i quit something cold turkey and go to the end of withdrawal happens without any problems. Sometimes, when i run out of a med I want to stop, i just don't buy it again and stay like that. According to my therapist, the only reason i abuse medication or anything else is a kind of ""despair"", a ""fear"" of not working, then going double """"'for good measure"""""" of ""just for sure"". It's way more anxiety than addiction by itself, because i have no problem with stopping, but when i do stop, the problems of anxiety come back, like binge eating, insomnia, panic attacks (i have panic syndrome) and lack of focus. According to my therapist, this is something we have to work out, but it will take a while, so i shouldn't be regretting taking meds i really don't like, but somehow make me dependent on them until the issue is securely settled.

Smart guy, funny, loving, caring... well, that was in the beginning before he started using every single day, multiple times a day.
I'm a medical student, I never partake in anything he does. I don't even drink alcohol. At the very beginning of our relationship he was honest enough to let me know about his past addiction to cocaine, how he was homeless for a while because of it too. He had lost everything to cocaine. Then he got ""clean"" (not completely, he just took control over his addiction) and would only do a bit of cocaine for maybe two or three days a month which, to be honest, i didn't mind.
He had a budget, he would do it at home and then maybe talk to his buddies on the computer and stuff. He doesn't really ""party"" because he knows he would loose his self control quick. 
He'd have ""fun"" for a weekend every month and I was okay with that.
Fast forward to the first days of September of this year, his buddy showed up with a BIG bag of it. And it was, according to him, one of the best cocaine he's ever had. I immediately freaked out, because I knew that bag would last a long time. That's why he always set up a budget and wouldn't get much. So as you can imagine, things went downhill from there.
He started using every day, multiple times a day (10+). It's been a month and a half, he's been doing drugs the whole time. There wasn't a day he wouldn't wake up and take a ine right away. A few days ago he ran out of it, called his buddy that very same day and got more of it.

Thing is, the very first weeks of him using cocaine every day he was still the loving and kind guy I met in the beginning... but times ten. Me, understanding how addiction and the brain chemistry works, immediately knew that it was the euphoria caused by the drug. Eventually he'd run out of the ""happy juice"", there's only so much the body can take.
So for the last month and a half I've been watching him change completely. His sweet personality turned into one filled with anger and stress and screaming over the tiniest things. And me, being his girlfriend, I'm always around him. So I'd be the one to have to take all his anger and rage. 
I've never been treated worse. I didn't know he could be like this. Then he just completely stopped being loving and caring. He no longer asks how my day was, how I'm doing, there's no interest.
As to be expected, his brain got depleted. Not a drop of dopamine left. So he's now very depressed (he doesn't admit it, but it's pretty obvious) He sleeps all day, he barely talks to me. He stopped doing the things he loved.

I love him with my whole heart but his radical change of personality is scaring me. I don't know if I'll ever be able to talk to the guy I fell in love with ever again.

The point of this post is to see if any of you that are or have been in his shoes, I want to know what goes through your mind. 
Do you care about the people around you? The people that love you? 
I want to know how you guys view this situation.. because I have no experience with drugs. 
Does it go away?... the change of personality I mean.
I know that it takes a while for dopamine to be back to normal levels... I'm just very curious.
This is very confusing.

He’s not a lazy partner but he can be a bit slow. He’s a loving person but I’ve never known him “sober” and we’ve been together for 3 years. I don’t know why I’ve got issues with him smoking it; probably because I’ve grown up in a conservative household. It seems he’s using weed as a coping mechanism and has been for the past 20 years 

My biggest issue is the fact that he smells of weed (and smoke) all the time, and my sister had even asked me if he was high the first time we all met and had dinner together. She told me she could smell the smoke on his clothes from a mile away and that he appears dull, boring and slow (he can be). I’m not sure if it’s the weed, I can only assume so. I want to introduce him to my family but not in this state.

He doesn’t see his habits as an issue because weed makes him more motivated, chilled and productive.

Over the last few months I've leant my partner x amount of cash for needed things which at first was what the money was being spent on, over time shes began to struggle to pay the money back and I've found out she's been gambling in excess of £1000 a month. It hit a hard point for me this week when I had already leant her £185 to for essentials due to her payments from work being staggered I recently learnt she has been moving hundreds of pounds from my bank to hers gambling and I don't know what to do. This year's been quite hard for myself as I work in care and spent large majority of time working on covid positive houses putting in silly hours - this is in part to invest and save and to take care of bills, family and her - everything I'm saving is being blown away and I'm being left struggling to make ends meet. By mid month this month I'm already left with £0 and she's had excess of £300 off of me (that I'm aware of). I'm currently working a 15hr shift and am hiding the fact I can't afford food for lunch etc from fellow workers. I'm begining to struggle mentally with it all and feel like my life isn't ever going to move forward. I've been very calm and content about it as she is my partner, she knows her self that if it was anybody else other than her or a family member I would've resorted to other means and been a horrible bastard to the person who did it. Morally I cannot condone it, I personally consider theft (especially of a loved one / family member) as one of the lowest of the lows.

I'm a 24 year old guy from Colorado who's 6 months sober from Xanax today though! (Woohoo!)   It's a miracle that I was taking 5 to 6 bars per day and have a stable job and place to live.  I haven't relapsed and somehow my family never confronted my about my addiction.  I am honestly so lucky to be alive and can't believe I have have made it this far :)  I plan to keep going and have never felt so strong and empowered.

I recreationally use other substances; nothing has ever controlled me the  way Xanax does, and I never crave any other substance.  I come from an upper middle class family and during the peak of my addiction, I lied to my family a lot to get money, which is where a lot of my guilt stems from.  I know a huge part of recovering is coming clean to everyone who was negatively impacted by the addiction, and I really want to tell my parents.  The scary part to me is that they are either avoiding the fact that I was a full blown addict, or have literally no idea that I was abusing Xanax and telling them will just break their heart.  I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons of possibly telling them what I was going through.  My Grandfather has stage 4 cancer and was an alcoholic, which is why I mentioned the fact that I can use other substances responsibly, but leads to the fact that I'm scared to tell my parents because of the family history.

I'm not scared of giving up other substances, I'm scared of my parents constantly worrying about if I am going to become an alcoholic after a glass of wine at dinner, or my mom staying up all night wondering if I'm overdosing.  Giving up all substances doesn't scare me, scaring my parents does; especially when I've worked so hard to overcome an anti-anxiety pill.  I'm looking for advice about if I should even tell my parents about my addiction since they have never brought it up to me.  My mom tells me she thinks I just smoke weed lol.  If you think I should tell my parents, please suggest some strategies/talking points about to discuss with my parents about addiction to help them understand that I've come so far, but I will always be battling a disease.

I know my parents will be worried, because I also worry about myself.  I just don't know if coming clean will do more harm than good.  I'm scared telling them the truth will drastically impact the progress I've made in the past six months and make me want to seek out Xanax again.  They will inevitably have a negative response if I tell them, and I want to know if you guys think telling the truth is worth having their perspective of me change forever.

2021-10-20 03:52:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/qbvo3f/advice_needed/,Advice needed…,"I had an entire essay typed out but I realized people wouldn’t really pay attention to me venting so here’s the short version. 

I don’t really have anyone to talk to so even negative comments would be appreciated.

I turned 19 last month and for the past year and a half I’ve been doing hard drugs on a daily basis. 

By hard I don’t only mean opioids ( H, fent, zenes, oxys ) but also meth, other stims, benzos, pregabalin, somas and alcohol. 

I graduated high school in June (2021) and went on a trip to Europe, ( I live in the US but I got family and friends in Europe ) and I kept doing the same drugs + up to two packs of cigarettes per day. 

The whole Europe trip is a thing me and my close family do every summer. My parents have a place there so I lived with them. The interactions between me and my parents were limited as we all mind our own business and try to be as respectful as possible.  

I knew that after summer vacay was over I’d have to go back to the states and attend the university of my choice ( pretty solid college to be honest ) 

Fast forward to august when my parents came to the realization that I was abusing substances as they stumbled across a handbag in my room. It was not your typical personal stash and the quantities were pretty insane so the whole thing could have turned into a intent to distribute case real quick. Thankfully it didn’t. 

For the past 2 months I’ve been back in the states living with them since they don’t trust me and wouldn’t let me go to college ( it’s about 5 hours away). 

Right now I’m taking online classes and I’ll transfer to my city’s State University in January (2022). 

I’m 7 weeks clean off everything and see a psychiatrist and my GP once a week. 

Last month I was also diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis and my GP was pretty concerned. 

So far the doctors I see only know about my benzo, adderall and alcohol abuse because I also have ADHD and want to speed the whole former addict medication thing up. I know they won’t put me on any stims for the next few years but that’s not my concern at the moment. 

My psychiatrist couldn’t believe the fact that I kicked a habit of up to 12mg of Xanax, 1.5g of lyrica and over 300mg of oxycodone a day. Cold turkey too. No seizures no nothing. Oh and about 15oz of hard liquor. I don’t really remember how much coke, meth and adderall I used to do but it was a decent amount. 

The thing is that I still crave these substances and I know for a fact that stims such as Ritalin ( or even 4f-mph) make me more productive and help me with my adhd. The benzos help with my adhd induced anxiety and help me sleep better. And the opioids, well… 

I have really easy access to anything and by anything I mean anything and this makes it really hard for me to forget about the euphoria and bliss they give you. 

I’m not in pain but the fact that I’m sober makes me feel invincible and Im really thinking about treating myself with a bag of H and some coke. 

I know that this is the worst possible idea that I could think of since it’s a terrible slippery slope and will probably have me going to rehab in a few months. 

I kind of want to risk it all just to test if I can maybe use with moderation this time ( I know it’s a cheap excuse, but I can’t really see myself staying sober in the near future). 

I know these cravings will fade overtime but I’m not sure if I’m gonna be strong enough to stay sober so what’s the difference ? 

I guess if any older folks would like to share their experiences I’d really really appreciate that.

What I did today is just one of the many examples that proves how insidious addiction is. 

So I got the vivitrol shot in detox where I stayed and had ten days sober leading up to today when I was released.  So what do I do knowing I can't get high on opiates?  I score some meth and get high. Literally an hour after leaving detox I'm rolling a bowl and blowing clouds.  Fortunately I realized how fucked off my actions were and I gave the pipe and bag of G to a homeless dude walking by. Is that fucked up? I mean he was ecstatic as I'm sure it's a rare occurrence that someone gives you a pipe with some meth. 

I don't know. I'm just so upset with myself. Maybe it shows a little personal growth that I gave everything away. At the same time it really reinforces how powerful the demons are that I'm up against. The thought that I'm not strong enough to beat this, and that I'm going to be one of the ones that doesn't make it, cross my mind all the time.

It's taken me 37 years to realize how powerful and insane addiction can be, and I'm afraid it's a battle that I personally can't win. It's almost like my brain is just wired to make bad decisions. To throw me off course. 

I really hope it's my destiny to survive and beat this. The thought of what my death would do to my family breaks my heart, and not even THAT can keep me sober.  That proves Addiction is a Paradox right? To quote Google ""a situation, person, or thing that combines contradictory features or qualities"". I'm a walking contradiction.  I am aware of the correct decision to make yet I instinctively make the wrong choice. I'm a living, breathing example of insanity.

I'm almost positive I'm being a little dramatic but maybe you guys could give me some advice and give me a little hope that this is a battle I can win. I know I need to find a higher power and I'm starting to believe that such a thing is the only power strong enough to keep me sober. I just have such a hard time believing in God when I see so much suffering in the world. How could a conscious creator allow such evil to exist?  Its just another contradiction that I can't make peace with. I think I might be doomed until I do. 

I guess it's likely that this post gets lost among more important matters than my own self pity, but if you happen to see this and can relate, just know you're not alone.

Throw away account. We dated for 8 months and moved in together. Pandemic hit us both hard, work cut my hours and I was struggling bad. Been together over year and a half now. We first started dating, she said she had some sort of stomach issues that Dr's ""couldn't diagnose"". Before we met, she spent a week in the hospital with debilitating stomach pains. She said pot was the only thing that gave her relief. For reference, in a month she smoked 1oz of grass plus about 3-4 10g carts. The grass was for at home and carts for during the day at work. 

After we dated for about 10 months, she realized she had Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome (CHS). So basically, pot was the cause of her stomach pains. She also admitted that's what the Dr's told her in the hospital, but she didn't believe them. She attempted to quit for about a month. At that point I distinctly remember her saying ""I just don't like who I am when I'm not high"". 

She started smoking again. Not nearly as much, but picked it back up. She claims the CHS is manageable. However, she smokes every day before work, after work, all weekend, before and during family functions, and won't eat without being high. She claims she doesn't smoke at work during the day, but I know she used to before she started trying to hide it. I never really see her sober. 

I've talked to her about cutting back to nights and weekends. Basically be sober at work since she's a medical professional. Anytime I bring it up, a fight ensues. I pointed out it's unprofessional to smoke a bowl right before going to a hospital to work. She says I knew she smoked before we started dating, and claims there is no difference between smoking for medical purposes or just being a pothead. Basically her argument: ""if it was OK for me to smoke for stomach pains, it's ok for me to smoke whenever I want. It's nobody's business why I smoke."" I had sympathy when I thought it was necessary to help with stomach pains, but now it's a bad habit. Any time I say anything about it, she argues, then just tries to hide it. 

Not sure what to do at this point. She can maintain this level for now, but she doesn't grasp the negative impact this is having. I try to reach out and point out obvious issues, but anything I say is met with hostility. 

I also feel slightly responsible since I helped her fake a drug test when she was hired at her current job. I was convinced it was for medicinal purposes and thought I was doing the right thing. I regret it now. She also uses that fact against me anytime I bring up her smoking too much.

So sorry ahead of time if this is everywhere dunno where to start or go with any of this lately it’s been hard to open up to others ,mainly because I feel like it hurts the entire recovery process and more and reason I say that is because when I do with my main/only full support person it seems to cause a lot of problems what begins as me talking or being ask to slowly becomes a frustrating talk on how difficult I am and making things and how there tired of it all the talks ,the relapses ,the recovery process and was told that they wish they didn’t have to deal with me ,it hurts to know that only because I thought things weren’t as excruciating and more,now I can admit I get Pissy and frustrated quick when withdrawals get going but after few days I’m good but hearing how I’m basically a burden numerous times I’ve slowly took less off there plate no more long talks ,mentioning my feels or how I’m craving etc ..then rather than sleeping through the harder moments of withdrawals I try taking care of things for them slowly and painfully lol sometimes I wanna just crash to floor for exhaustion but I try to make em happy but no matter what It seems to not matter or toll has been taken I guess ,I get the hint kinda that I should leave or personally feel like I should I hate the feelings I get when hearing countless negative things when most them I saw more positive ,I feel like I’ve asked bare minimum from them all I asked was for a good job here and there nothing more really in all reality I don’t even get to say what should be said because at a point  the conversation dies and what plans that were supposed to be made all die and it’s just bleh and I feel completely bad and go away for bit to give em air in ways I feel like I’ve done nothing but cater and be mindful of them opposed to anything with me ,I can’t even have friends to support because it makes them jealous or mad so it ends up being me doing it all trying and fighting and trying to encourage myself but the negativity gets to me and sets me back and eventually messes things up for another relapse .I’ve given my all and was 100% on board and proud etc as days went by and my confidence in staying sober kept me going but those random talks on how bad I am and more burdening things slowly takes that away ,one of our talks pretty much took everything I was proud of and doing and made it sound so pointless I just lost hope and threw away my reminders and what not and stopped mentioning how many days I was clean ..I stopped being proud of myself and more ,if I relapsed I said nothing unless it was obvious that I was high ,stopped making plans and goals and just went day by day ,it gets to points where I relapse because all the negativity and hurt  and start using to hurt myself because I don’t feel deserving I then don’t use to be ok or happy I use to inflict damage I’ll snort til my nostril ache and my throat blisters and more it’s miserable but it feels like I deserve it why be proud of who I am with everything bad or seemingly bad in the past that I did ,why feel happy when I make someone else feel so much ugly ,I’ve developed a lot of self hate  and it becomes a ugly cycle I don’t project it on to others all everyone gets is catered cuz I’m trying to please em or I’m silent and stay to myself I only act up if provoked but will tell whoever to stop and I don’t wanna be ugly or whatever is triggering  and if they choose to push I will push back not my fault fully but I’m held accountable as if I randomly started ..And we’ve had a few talks lately and my bad past gets brought up and kills a good day and I do eventually get stuff ,this last relapse I haven’t said anything because I knew it would be bad but was pushed to talk and I even said let’s sort things out so there’s no problems and there’s more structure and understanding and few mins into convo it’s all about how hard it is and they get frustrated with me and i try Defending myself but get cut off and I just don’t try I just let em talk I’m understanding things I’m not trying to be selfish or anything it’s just hard because I can’t do nothing and I feel 100% worse  even with me doing everything for em and trying to not need em to help me it sometimes gets warped as if I did nothing at all everything disregarded and then I get lil attitude  and called out for having it and I say there’s no point of talking anymore about it because it’s pointless I’m damned if I do damned if I don’t ,I get it can be hard for the support sometimes but I can’t help but feel like there was lil to no support to say it was a lot for them on top that I’m not only catering to them and watching what I do or say I’m having to deal with everything alone from withdrawals and more it seems easier to stay on stuff than burden em for lil support so I can be better ,I didn’t even get to mention how bad my use was this last time and how I felt and more which is close to being a start of a complete drug take over / death wish ..in some instances this last time I’ve used alot back to back and ignored pains and more and the drug don’t do anything at this point cuz my tolerance is so high and I’m pretty much doing it to suffer ,the pain and suffering masks the want to die because of all the guilt and shame and more in some ways I stopped caring completely bout myself and trying to end the problem that’s burdening so much,it’s not my fault fully that I keep messing up I don’t break so easy by myself it’s the negativity and downing and more but that’s me blaming them and causes more issues and I’m taking owner ship that yes I bought it I used it but I didn’t start stuff and didn’t put anything down myself am I supposed to take ownership of that as well? Might as well be the reason there’s bad days in the world lol idk  what to do with things I’m not sure if I should leave or stay  and i don’t have any plans or anything im trying or looking forward to it all feels pointless ..sorry had to get it all out didn’t have any other way to it just feels off ,even reading countless recovery tips and more makes me feel like I’ve asked nothing of anyone for support besides a reminder im doing ok because I won’t think im doing any good ,i feel like asking anything from anyone or a group is just gonna be me burdening so I’ll stick to myself and figure it out alone ..",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7569181}"

I am 25 year old i have worked since i was 16 but was never able to save some money, why ? addictions, thats how when i started working life was simple i would go out of work buy some cigs some weed and spend some time with my friends smoking weed, as the time passed things changed, my friends went away that made me spend more time alone the things i did with them smoking and drinking i passed on doing them alone, and i started drinking alot more with this. i actually stopped smoking and started drinking heavily, a year later my parents were kinda tired of the way i lived my life (work, outside work i would only do two things 1 was playing videogames, the other binge drinking) they decided to take me to a psycologist okay no problem, after that came the psychiatrist... well hell went loose with that, besides drinking like i hell i started to mix it with pills that lasted arround 3 years. I crashed 2 cars got caught driving drunk 2 times, went to the hospital 4 times because i got beaten up. I still had my work and i do still have it, doesnt make me happy i cant value it. Since i dont pay for expenses i tend to spend all my money on stupid things, and well. Stupid thing is wasting all your money on camgirls.... I did it way to often i would earn 700 a month and spend 600 in 5 nights the other 100 was for booze that would last for a week. I started going to this websites when i turned 19 and i still go there sometimes not very often but everytime i do its disaster. And after that well it came the prostitutes at least with them you get to touch, but if i was spending 600 in 5 nights with camgirls with the real girls i was spending it in a single night... good thing is that i didnt had to pay for my drinks since i was a high roller i think... Im fucked up im unhappy my biggest addictions is alchohol videogames and girls... Well im so adicted to porn right now that everyday i check  the new scenes that came out, it takes me 4 days to fill up my 1 tb hardrive with it... I cant controll myself, everything i do i must binge it...                                                     
Im 25 years old was never able to save money from work even not paying bills and expenses. The only i thing i think i did it right was my 1st tattoo. I feel ashamed of myself and i am tired i want to change, but at the same time i dont want to change. honestly i dont think that the problem is the alcohol i think that the problem is my life.

She had a child quite young (child is now 4),and has always struggled with ED and drinking since before her birth and it has only accelerated after. She goes off on manic sprees verbally screaming and being insane when she is drinking and on her pills and it is amplified by the fact that she literally doesn’t eat. I don’t know what to say to her anymore or how to help her, it seems like these episodes happen every week and I can’t get her to get help, because it seems she doesn’t want help. When she is sober, she lies and pretends she’s okay, when she is obviously not, and my family is really non-confrontational so no one knows how to talk to her about it. I believe they fear even bringing it up to her will cause her to spiral. Her current boyfriend doesn’t know what to do either as when she gets like this she is uncontrollable. I am scared she is going to die and her child will be left with no mother (father is in jail) and I will always regret not trying harder to save her, even though she doesn’t want to be saved.

He was constantly lying to everyone, stealing, and nodding off everywhere to the point of totaling his car. He admitted to me last night that he overdosed three times during his addiction. The only time I had known about was the time I walked in and found him myself.

A year later we are living together for the first time in a new state, we have our own place to ourselves, he has a well paying job he really loves, and just bought himself a new car. We are planning to adopt a dog this weekend for our 5th anniversary. I have never seen him so happy and I am so eternally grateful he made the decision to get clean. Seeking advice on this sub for how to help him was one of the best things I'd done and I'm grateful I was guided with such empathy and kindness. To the person who encouraged me to take action when I found out he was secretly texting his dealer a month into sobriety, thank you, you are the reason he did not relapse that day.

She takes 10mg oxy, and 5mg between those, has a sub for dialudid. I’ve seen her countless times in the ER saying “the meds don’t work”…cuz she’s taken so damn much. At this point the drugs are making her worse.

It’s like nothing I do or say can get they to her. She simply doesn’t listen and seems like she doesn’t care. Tough love doesn’t work cuz she just throws it back on your and has a pity party. 

She just got her meds from CVS and the pharmacist had to pull my stepdad aside and note the intensity of these drugs, and asked if we keep narcan around.

My mind is constantly racing from the moment i wake up until the second i fall asleep. I have no one really, never had emotional stability in my life. 

I was asking myself if i have an issue with addictive behaviour because a friend of mine was worried that my substance use will become an addiction. 

I started drinking at 14 and smoking weed at 15 or 16. Alcohol was something i used a lot back then because it was easier to get. Then in college (which im still in) i started using much more weed. I got into a relationship and this person made me quit weed for her, so i did. I also didn't drink much because i didn't feel like it most of the time, but i did eat a lot. Now this relationship ended a few months ago. 

Since then i'm spiraling in all my trauma. The things that made me question the stuff in title are:
I sleep a lot. 
I was gaming for 2 months constanly, day and night until i got bored. Barely ate. 
Then i got drunk a lot. Drunk in front of my family as well. 
College started again and so did the smoking. 
Now i really enjoy the combination of weed and alcohol and i can't stop thinking about it.
I'm using daily except for when i have none, which doesnt happen that much with alcohol. But this weekend it did because i had no energy to go out so then i started binge eating, which is odd considering i had no apitite. 

I noticed there is always one or more things that i'm doing to get my mind somewhere else. Is this unhealthy? Do you think i might have a problem? I don't think of myself as an addict because i have gone through a lot of time without used weed or alcohol. But then yea lots of eating, or gaming and not eating at all. 
It's so weird to describe. 

Can someone help me out please? Is this relatable/problematic? 

Could this be a stage right before addiction really starts? Do i have an addictive personality? 

Is this something other people go through as well?

I feel like I've ruined my entire adult life. Severe cognitive decline and social anxiety.,"I (19M) started smoking weed when I was 16 in year 10 of high school. When year 11 rolled around I started having hypomanic episodes, dissociating and cycling extreme moods. Since then it's all been a rollercoaster. I continued to smoke to cope with these feelings. Things kept getting more extreme. I would get sent into a state of pure joy and confidence but I would become someone I don't recognise. Then I would crash and be lethargic, depressed and dissociated. It has been never ending. 

Things have gotten better and worse. I have noticed a severe cognitive decline as I smoked more and more. My manic state would temporarily fix this and I was fooled into believing that when I felt this energy and joy that it was how I was supposed to feel and craved it constantly. 

I'm high right now typing this. I just relapsed 3 weeks ago after 4.5 months of sobriety. At the beginning of the year my smoking got to a point where I could no longer feel the same manic energy and joy that I had previously felt and after a near suicide attempt the reality of life set in and I was feeling prepared to let my mind recover. My hope was slowly diminished as a severe cognitive decline set in. My memory and focus have completely left me and continue to get worse. I struggle to think. Anxiety fills me everyday and there's no room to think. I can't process the world around me anymore. It feels like all the good qualities I had before I smoked have completely faded into dust. I obsess all day about how fucked I am and how I don't have the control to do the most basic shit like cleaning and conversating. I struggle to conversate at all nowadays.

I'm lost on what to do at this point. I've been doing cycling everyday since and it has become a chore but I'm afraid if I lose that habit I'll have nothing to live for. My brain is not recovering in sobriety. If anything it feels like it's deteriorating at a faster rate. Time is flying by and I can't remember anything.

I've been gambling for over a decade despite I'm in my early 30s.

Since I discovered *recovery* as a word (I'm not a native English speaker), I'm following a different path in my life and try to do whatever it takes to heal myself and potentially help others who are struggling. I'm not here to give advice, nor to tell how great is life or similar things. Life sometimes sucks. All I want is to share. To share what's in me and what matters for me. In this regard, I recently started my podcast '[Strangers in Recovery](https://strangersinrecovery.club/)' where my main purpose is to talk to people who are in recovery, regardless of their age, location, gender, or any of the things that might separate people. Cause I deeply believe we are all in this constant fight and without each other, we could not be able to keep our heads above the water.

I hope it's not against any rules or similar things in this sub to show the 2 episodes that are out already and only ask you to listen with care and empathy.

My parents never were addicted. Just my mom who was a smoker always let me smell her cigarettes when I was younger because I enjoyed the smell. I also got drugged with MDMA in the Kindergarden. This left me in a severe psychosis from 5-12. Pretty sure this happened because of early drug consumption but I started puberty with 10 and it ended with 15.

I have started smoking with 13 and drinking with 14. Got a pothead with 15 and started taking acid that age too. In the same age I started experimenting with DPH + DXM. That again, left me in a 6 month psychosis + permanent HPPD which I don't care about. 

I have made a break during that time and only took MDMA twice at my 17 and 18th birthday. After that I just casually smoked CBD and a bunch of cigs. Then there came my 19th birthday. Where I started taking pure amphetamine Sulfate. I became addicted within a second. 

I have used it daily for 3 months and took acid multiple times, to be exact 40 different drugs from that day without a day of stop. It's the 7th month now I am addicted. 

I don't look like 19. I don't feel like 19. Pretty sure my body is close to age 25-30. That's what everyone thinks I look like. I have accepted that I am an addict. But I feel like the help I get ""professionaly"" isn't that professional at all in my area.

When I went to rehab I asked him to come so we can do this together, he specifically said “No” he’s not ready to get clean anytime soon. 🚩. I respected that at the time because I knew how long it took me to want to get clean. However, the problem is that I feel like I’m taking on a lot more responsibility than he has in the year we’ve been together. I went to rehab, got clean, stayed clean, started looking for full time work, while focusing on my relationship & side business, etc. He’s a contractor and gets limited work only and when he’s off most days he sits on the computer sometimes for 48 hours and listens to podcast & makes music. That’s all. I respect the music making, but he’s not motivated to get a regular job or take care of things around the house. I think I’m falling out of love and would like some advice.

yesterday at 5pm, i took the courage to delete my discord account permanently. it'll take around two to four weeks to actually delete. however, now i don't really know what to do with my time, or how to recover and bring myself up. additionally, everyone is applying to college, and i don't want colleges to think i'm a failure because i'm actually really capable and have so much potential, but i have a discord addiction which lead to a binge eating addiction. any advice on steps on how to recover?

i really want to make up my school work before the semester ends (november 8th) but i can't bring me to. additionally, my best friend is dating my crush which makes it even harder for me to cope and recover. i just really want to go back to normal when i wasn't like this, when i was smart and happy and had friends. please, give sincere advice.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.57641745}"

I got forced by my mum to stay clean after I ended up in hospital a few weeks ago after an overdose and haven’t did anything except smoke weed since. My friends had a party last night for the first time since I’ve been sober and I didn’t realise how difficult this would be. 

Usually when I’m depressed, I can still make it to a party or bender because I’ll  have something getting me fucked up but now I haven’t been out since being sober because I can’t trust myself to just be sober unless I’m around my friends who are sober too. I keep thinking “maybe when I go I can just get a gram of ket? ket isn’t that bad right?” but have any substance defeats the point because I get hooked no matter what it is. 

My mum wants me to call a drug and alcohol service but I don’t think I need it because there’s nothing in particular or nothing I will withdraw from, I’ve just got an addictive personality and it’s only been 2 weeks and I already wanna cave and just get a bottle of wine or snort a line of anything or do 100mg of codeine and lie on my bed for hours not giving a fuck about anything.

The main reason was that my relationship and work were at risk if I kept consuming as I was doing. In the rehab center I went to I felt kind of an outsider, when I compared myself to heavy users of other substances. The focus of the center was 100% sobriety, and I was fine with that. By being sober I could see that I was avoiding many of my problems instead of facing them, making them look way scarier.

Long story short, I lasted one year in that center and after that I joined personal therapy to deal with other psychological issues that group therapy couldn't deal with. It's been now over two years since I last smoked or drank something.

If I see in retrospective, I don't see my abuse of substances as something problematic, but instead I have been telling myself that I abused the substances because I had all these other problems. These last few weeks I've even started fantasizing in smoking weed again, but thinking that I'll be able to manage it this time. Two days ago my therapist found I was depressed, without feeling any lassion in my life.

I have to say, I really like my life as a sober person, but I miss being high or tipsy as an entertainment.

As someone who has never relapsed, is it possible to control the consume habits?

Sorry if my story is not useful, but I needed to take these thoughts out of my chest and hopefully you can help me. 
Lastly, thank you for all your cases. I like being part of this group.

2. I’m going to use until the day I die.

Somehow I was always able to fly under the radar with it at the workplace and still be high almost 100% of the time. Drug abuse inevitably always got to the point though where it didn't even matter anymore if I got high from it or not, I just needed it to function that day and to feel ""normal"". All the years of thinking I had it under control did finally hit the fan at my last job. I got fired for the first time in my life and my addiction was the reason. I've been constantly beating myself up over it every day that I've spent jobless ever since. I can't even get myself to look for another job anymore either because the shame runs so deep for me having to explain now in an interview why I got fired from my last job and that alone keeps me from moving forward with my life. I really want to be honest about it so they don't end up finding out anyways with a routine call to my last place of employment or something. It needed to happen though or I never would of quit using. I am clean now for 4 months so I'd put much emphasis on that part and hope the honesty and taking accountability for making bad choices would stand out to the interviewer way more than just them judging me and immediately placing me with the negative stigma drug addicts get stuck with instead.
I'm starting to feel like I don't deserve a second chance at all now because even I see myself being a drug addict as worthless and flawed, though I'm clean and should be proud of it. 
I'd love to change the perspective I have of myself but drugs took all the good qualities away and replaced them with just the toxic ones instead. So, here I am, trying to clear away the wreckage and pollution I fed to my mind, body and spirit all those years while also relearning what life is supposed to feel like for the average sober person too.

(Spouse),"So I’ve never used any drugs whatsoever but a little while into dating my now wife I found out that she was injecting cocain, to me as a total sober person this was a shock and I was fairly uneducated. I did my research and told her that obviously given how serious I was about the relationship it wouldn’t work if she couldn’t quit. There was a bit of her trying to hide it for a few months but then she did commit pretty heavily. It was hard and she really really struggled. It seemed like every couple months she would give in and use something else- oxy, Percs, etc. hell I seen her googling random horse drugs and their effects on humans. It was like she just struggling being totally sober even if it wasn’t one particular drug. However things slowly but surely did get better. Although it was like once a year she would but cocain again and relapse until she ran out and then felt so terrible about it she didn’t use it again for another year. She found an online counselor who she really like talking to and who held her really accountable. She talked with him for about 90 days (it’s a program type thing) and continues to be part of online forums for NA. For the last 2 years she’s been mostly sober. I say mostly because despite no cocain she still occasionally has admitted she used pills once when she found them at a family members house, etc. this is very infrequent but it’s like just occasionally she fails and gives in BUT doesn’t fall back into the swing of things fully like she was. I’ve read some things that say small relapses like that are normal to most recovery and often are followed by longer sober periods between until they reach a good place. That’s not to excuse her use in those situations mind you, I’m very serious about this but from where she came to her now is a long way. She doesn’t always like talking about it with me which I get but it’s just hard to be the one on the sidelines giving support but not being able to fight the battle. 

I guess how should I take this? Is her progression to recovery fairly common? She still struggles and I know that if she really wanted to hide something she could. However I also know that every book about supporting an addict says you can’t just interrogate them every night. That some level of trust has to be there. 

If it’s worth note her use is trauma based, she was sexually assaulted as a child and still struggles with that.

Background: He has lied several times about being clean and has used my ignorance about drugs to make me believe things. I didn’t grow up learning much about drugs and its severity. I grew up in the country and was not around it, and school hardly got into it. Boy, did I learn. Important to note that we are not together and he lives in a different state. Years of heroin addiction and possibly meth. He also claims to go to a detox center and get methadone. No rehab. Here is the exchange:

Him: I’m just glad and happy I’m doing well. You’ll see the difference. I’m killing it at my new job and just feeling good. 

Me: Well, you do know you’ll need rehab eventually, right?

Him: Yeah, I suppose. I’m like ten months off of it though and have no urges or interest to go back. I don’t think about it. 

Me: I am sorry, but I do not believe that.

Him: I know you don’t. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have brought it up.

Me: I don’t mean to be discouraging, but I think you need to go to rehab.

Him: That’s okay. I understand. But, I can’t go to work and be like, “Hey everybody. I’m your new manager that kills it on a daily basis, but I’m taking a month off for rehab.”

Me: I know I wasn’t educated before, but I am now, and I’ve seen so many heroin overdoses at work. It can’t possibly be that easy and quick. (I work in an ER)

Him: I’m doing so well mentally, and didn’t think twice about it. But, that’s true. If I use now, I’m dead. No doubt about it. My tolerance for it is damn near gone. 


Thoughts? I just feel alone and he’s very, very good at manipulating. It’s easy for me to feel bad that he hardly sees his child. I don’t ask for money, but he doesn’t contribute.

My skin became dull, got red vainly eyes, severe eyebags and rapid hairloss. I went to 2-3 psychiatrists but all of them felt like I was talking to a wall and hear all the time the same things…well the last one tried to put me into a psychoclinic and I gave up those „seek help“ advices. Well I decided one day to shove a cigarette in my mouth and smoke it…to be honest I felt finally relaxed and since I started smoking cigarettes my sleep problems disappeared and so my negative thoughts. Now I want to stop but after a day I will think „I don’t want to go through hell again“ and I smoke again. I want to stop and start working out again but somehow…I don’t want.

My substance abuse councilor once said that you know shit hit the fan when the first thing you think about when you wake up if your drug of choice. And when the last thing you think about before you fall asleep is your drug of choice. When you start stealing for that drug of choice. When you are lying because of that drug of choice.

That is when it all hit me. You see I was in denial. I didn't think you could become addicted to something like weed. I've always heard that weed is such a safe drug to do for whatever reason. The funny thing with addiction is you don't get addicted to the substance you get addicted to the feeling. I enjoyed the feeling too much. The escape it gave me. The happiness I felt. The first few euphoric moments before all the bad comes crashing in. 

I recently relapsed because I thought that if I stoped taking my medication I would be fine. Spoiler alert I wasn't.

Since i can remember i've been addicted to the rush, just to feel something different. I was 6 and jumping from higher and higher to feel the adrenaline until i fucked up and broke my ankle. 10 years old stealing cigarettes from dad, it made me almost throw up every time but i felt so cool and stealing gave a rush. I haven't stolen anything in about 8 years but i've been using weed daily for 4 years and hard drugs ( speed, coke, mdma, ketamine or alcohol) weekly. I know my regular life would change for the better if i stoped but I don't want a regular life. I thrive in chaos and addiction, i still have a home and go to school. But when everything goes well and ""how it's supposed to"" i get bored real fast and try to get some excitement, which often results in self sabotaging. I don't know why I'm like this and don't know how to stop??? Sound familiar to anyone? Is their a mental diagnosis in there or is it just dopamine/adrenaline addiction ?

I am F 24 
My father hurt his back terribly working in a foundry when I was 5 and had a surgery to correct it. The doctor completly fucked up the surgery and fucked his back up even more. He sued the doctor and won at about age 6. My dad has been on fentanyl patches ever since. The 100 mcg/hr and the 25mcg/hr ones. He was addicted to the point of putting too many of them on and overdosing. I remember looking for an hour and finding him overdosed on the floor of the garage in winter when I was 8. My mom even wrote out a calendar of when he was supposed to put them on but it never worked. He was on disability and home all of the time. My mom worked 60 to 80 hour work weeks to take care of us 4 kids. She loved and cared, but was gone quite a bit in my childhood. 
My parents fought so much. They hated each other and only stayed together for the house and us kids. It was equally good as it was bad. I guess you could say both parents were equally neglecting. Mom at work all the time, and dad too high to notice me or overdosing or being in between patches and going through withdrawals. He would lay in bed with a pillow and blanket over his head for 24 hours straight. No eating, no drinking, no peeing. 
My parents hated each other. Breaking things and slamming doors. Calling each other the ugliest nastiest things imaginable. I've heard it all. 
My mom got sick of my father's addiction one day and got a safe with a combination lock and a key you had to put in at the same time. She gave me a key. I had to keep it hidden at all times. I couldn't tell anyone the combo. Not even my siblings had a key or the combo. Me, the youngest of 4 in charge of a 40 year old man's fentanyl patches in 6th grade. I had to call my mother each time before I opened the safe to get patches out for my dad. My dad used to put so much pressure and guilt on me about opening it without my mother's permission. I wouldn't break because she kept count of the patches and even wrote them on the boxes in permanent markers. She wrote on the patches on my dad's skin too. He also usex to cut the oatches open and eat them. I could tell when he did because he would talk with a lisp and his eyes would be glazed over. He used to say ""Don't you know your dad is in pain. We don't need to tell mom. Come on, just open it."" I struggled with this immensely as a child. Calling my mom in the middle of the night while she is at work and unable to pick up. But now you're crying because of the pressure and guilt and mom won't answer my 5th call and now dad is getting angry.
Fast forward into adult life, my dad stopped doing fentanyl, but replaced it with cocaine and weed. 
We don't have a relationship, due to his inability to take accountability for himself and my childhood, and unwillingness to talk about it. Also, some other fucked up shit he did.....

Also, after being sextorted a few days ago, I realize how much shame and pain I feel as a result of my sexual addiction to masturbation. If you have read the book, which I highly suggestion you do, you will realize how it goes for ""Nice Guys."" 

My whole life, I never understood anything about the way our bodies work and the sexual energy. As far as I can remember, my parents shunned me ever having sexual thoughts. Anytime I saw anything with a sexual moment, my eyes were covered till the age of 15. After that, my parents would command me to cover my eyes when told to do so. I thought it was a blessing to do so cause I thought sex as a sin and being sexual as a sin. I didn't realize how much of an effect it would cause me till now. My religion wasn't particularly too conservative but no one in my religion ever gave a clear definition of the concept. I didn't realize what a penis was till first semester of 9th grade, porn till second semester of 9th grade, a vagina till 11th grade, and how sex worked till first semester of 12th grade. I didn't know what masturbation was until 12th grade (the joke was ""do you jerk?"" and I thought it mean't like am I an actually jerk at times) and I didn't start masturbating till my first year in college when I realized how it worked and I didn't realize how it felt till then. 

I went on a high with masturbation. I would masturbate every single day, most around three times a day and sometimes even up to five times a day, and at the most random times and places. Well, at that time, there was really no attractive girls where I was in community college so I didn't take it seriously for any relationship or connection with girls. It wasn't until I transferred that I saw so many of them but didn't have the courage, confidence, or the social comprehension. So, as a result, I stormed off to unhealthy masturbation habits which involved porn, pictures of girls I've been attracted to, and fantasy of girls I've been attracted to. I have been doing it for around 2 years(ish) and I've noticed it has had a number on me. It has affected me personally, and I've been realizing it from the book that I have shame and fear, that has been around since childhood, and I also realized it affected my confidence and ability to talk to girls comfortably. I always felt I had to do something to make it worth their time and never focused on myself. Hence, I was always focused on other girls' needs, qualities, and validations. As I was always discouraged to pursue my sexual needs, I hid them from everyone and spent a lot of time to myself having an unhealthy obsession to masturbation. To this day, I haven't had sex, had a kiss, or done anything intimate. There have been times that I was desperate for sex and relied on hookup websites and other means, but in most cases, I was always craving for it but never got anything from. I also got increasingly jealous when I would see others being intimate. So, as a way to help myself away from the pain and all, I sticked to unhealthy ways of masturbation. 

In the past few days, I have limited my masturbation from three times a day to once a day to stop masturbation completely (trying to follow the NoFap). However, the book encouraged to discover my sexuality without thinking of shame, fear, or pleasuring anyone but myself and just thinking about the moment with what felt right to me. Therefore, today, being fully naked on my bathroom floor with a sheet, I spent the time stroking my penis slow, fast, and even gently, and I was just thinking about my penis, than fantasizing or thinking about girls, and how I am grateful for my body as a man. Never, besides the first time, have I ever taken the time to learn more about myself than today. 

I am still sexually confused due to inexperience, and I don't know where I'm gonna go with this, but I am focusing on my needs, myself, and everything relating to me first before anyone else. For anyone who has experienced in similar ways to me and coming out of addiction and doing healthy ways to masturbate and all, please share here and tell me how it has changed your life. The more y'all share, the better it'll help me in figuring things out. Thanks for hearing me out",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5667319}"

I choose to believe he can make it through this, just so I can kick his ass so bad he's back in the hospital for a different problem. 

Ever since high school he hung out with a lot of the rave crowd, my intent is not to point fingers just kind of explain, he would get in trouble with minor dismeanors. Later on he started dating a girl and they both fell victim to drug abuse, as far as I know mainly weed (which in my opinion who cares as long as you're not mixing like this idiot did) but also prescription meds, downers is how his friend explained it. 

He got arrested with possession of those prescription meds not belonging to him, apparently just under the amount of dealing or whatever. He had probation, got through it, told me he was scared shitless from the experience and I believed it.

Ever since we moved in I would ask my dad, does he always cough this much, get sick this much? Dad also took him for his words face value and would say the same thing my brother told me. Stuff like, oh upset stomach from bad food etc. I got concerned enough to where I pleaded with him to go to a doctor he refused vehemently blaming my thought process on COVID. 

I just am dealing with 20/20 hindsight influencing the voices in my head caused from my schizophrenia and am seeing so many warning signs that I ignored because I feel like I'm a nuisance to everyone in my life.

If this guy makes it through this I want to know how I can support and help him progress in life. This is going to damage him considerably I imagine and for fucks sake I hope it doesn't affect his mind dramatically but I'm worried.

My whole family is revolving around him right now just hoping he can make it through this.

Last year around this time, I tried to get clean by thugging it out. I couldn't. I couldn't male it 3 days. The worst part was the  whole body restlessness and  lack of sleep. Oh yeah and the anxiety and depression. People that relate opiate withdrawal to having the flu, man..

Opiate withdrawal is more like drowning every second but I just won't die. 

A man told me not to long ago had he had a loaded gun he wouldn't used it. 

Years ago, when I first started binging on my bottle of 5's and then would go thru withdrawal *only after two weeks* I would feel crummy for about 4 days a month, but late into that experience discovered gabapentin and it took away so much of my symptoms!

I did that about 2 years ago last time when my 'script would run out and it wasn't too sucky. 

Last year around this time, after being on fentanyl a few months, gabapentin actually did nothing but make the situation worse! I was all over the bed I couldn't get comfortable! I wasn't sleeping, I was in alot of pain, it was hell. 

I met a person not too long ago that said they knew how to bypass all of this. 

He said I could take some suboxone after one day with no usage  because I needed to bypass precipitated withdrawals. Then I can add some benzos the first days so I can sleep. 

Sleep! Sleep sleep beautiful, deep, 

But what happens when I need some more suboxone and it's not being prescribed to me? Am I back to square one? 

I want off this ride. 

Thinking about what's going  to happen to  me makes me terrified. 

I don't want to go to detox and expose myself as an addict because I know I'll just get accused of drug seeking for the rest of my life.

Is there a way to do detox at home? 
I remember years ago people discussing at home methods and  how they did it. I am beyond the Thomas Method and telling me to take some ibuprofen is so belittling. I can't even take 50 MG of Vicodin to feel better when I was going into withdrawal last week on an airplane. 

Please help. 

When my habit was small enough Kratom saved me once but fentanyl? Shit.

2021-10-11 19:56:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/q6985v/there_is_no_normal/,There is no normal,"When we become addict to anything, we will never be free of the urge to go back. As soon as we become dependent to any kind of instant way to get a hit of dopamine, our brains are programmed to go back to it, no matter if you are on your 10th day or your 1000th day. 

We are in a journey of going from negative to zero, when we success, we will be at the starting line as every one else but with a scar in our mind. The tendency of going back to our own way is going to be there. But why there are people that can beat an addiction and there are people who no matter how many they try, being an addict seems like their destiny. 

Our biggest enemies are loneliness and disconnecting with other human beings. Every single one of us has their stories, each of us has stressful moments, each of us has been down on our feet once in a while. But not all of us are addicts. Being able to truly pour your heart out, being truly listened to by another human being makes the difference. Your problems will never go away by just sharing, but it will take off your emotional burden. You won't then need an instant way to forget about it. 

My point of saying this is, it is okay if you fail once or twice on your journey, it's okay to start at day 0 again. Doing 1 pushup is better than doing nothing. But the more important thing is to start connecting to other human beings, find someone that you could share your life with. It could be your family, your friend, your partner. Find someone who will truly listen to you without interrupting for an advice. We don't need advises, or else we would go to rehab, or we could Google it. We need a safe space where we could share our darkest deepest thoughts, where we know the person we are talking with will not judge us. So return to the most basic human thing - talk, share, connect. We are living in a world where people connect to each other via a screen and invisible waves. That is not how Mother Nature built us. That is not how human are programmed.

I posted about this in r/relationships and I feel it was very unhelpful. I wanted to go to a subreddit where people may actually understand. 

I met my boyfriend just over a year ago. When we met, he was sober. One of the most attractive things about him was the way he spoke about his 10 years of active drug use. He almost went to federal prison for drug trafficking even. He took so much responsibility for himself. He was positive and practiced radical acceptance. He didn't hate himself for his past, but he acknowledged it fully and understood how and why it happened. We clicked instantly. I have never had a friendship or relationship like this. We took it slow for a few months, but neither of us could resist falling face forward after a while. He has made a great life for himself. He has a wonderful job, makes a ton of money, he is well-liked and respected. He's someone I greatly admire. Someone I often strive to be like. 

When we met he told me he'd been fully sober for a year. He said periodically he would take a psychedelic or some ketamine. I have a complicated view of drugs myself. I was once addicted to oxy, but have never felt that way about any other substance. I haven't used oxy in 6 years. No desire whatsoever. It was too awful getting off of it to ever want to go back. I do however, view drugs like weed, LSD, mushrooms, DMT and even ketamine in certain settings, as potentially therapeutic or even spiritual. When he told me he occasionally, once a year or so, does these drugs, I wasn't thrilled. Mainly because he'd been an 'everything addict'. He didn't have a specific vice. I did trust that he knew what was best for him. He is so self-assured and it's hard to question someone that confident. I asked why he felt the need to do ketamine specifically and he said 'It's fun and it makes me feel like I got a reset'. I didn't argue with it. I barely knew him. 

Eight months into us dating, he and I decided to move in together. I know that is soon and I have NEVER done that before. The last person I moved in with was after three years of dating, but I felt secure. We thought about apartments, but he concluded he would buy another house (he has a rental property) and we could make it our own. His brother would move in with us as well. I was very excited, but also super nervous. I have bipolar disorder. It is actually relatively moderate, but it still has a notable impact on myself and my relationships. My last partner was a bit cruel about my mental health and I am traumatized lol. 

ANYWAY. My boyfriend's brother is also an addict. However, he has never been able to fully kick it. My boyfriend has been mostly sober for the better part of five years. The most his brother has ever gone is a few weeks. Maybe. His brother does heroine. 

A little bit before getting the house, about two months, we all decided (their mother included) to help his brother get sober. He was living in a crappy apartment and started having psychotic episodes where he was hearing voices and seeing shadows. We checked him into the hospital for a 72 hour hold. His psychiatrist had him of thirteen medications. The doctors were horrified. After that, we all put in great effort to get him recovered and out in the world. He's been to rehab numerous times and they wanted to try a different approach. 

Things seemed to be going well until a few weeks in. My boyfriend's brother started sleeping all day and exhibiting the tell tale signs of relapse. I told my boyfriend I felt his brother was probably using again. He didn't want to believe it, which I understand. However, the day after we moved into the new house, my boyfriend caught his brother smoking heroine in the basement. He immediately packed up all his stuff and dropped him off at the old apartment. We hadn't terminated the lease just incase this happened. This was almost four months ago.

This event deeply impacted my boyfriend. I didn't even know how badly until a month or so later. The day he brought his brother back to his apartment, he came home and said ""I am getting kratom and cake. Please don't question me about it. I won't do it again."" and he left. 

\[ When we met he not only was sober, but he didn't drink coffee or eat sweets. He felt he had so little impulse control, that he wanted to remove anything and everything even remotely habit forming from his life. That included cake. If you're unsure what kratom is, it's a low grade opiate you can get from the smoke shop in most states. \]

As you can assume, this was a bit alarming to me. I don't care about cake or coffee and kratom is so random to me. However, he doesn't do that stuff. I believed him though. He wouldn't do it again. Over the next two weeks, things got a bit out of control. He was taking kratom every day, sometimes twice a day. I told him it was a problem, he agreed and said he'd stop. I didn't question it further, but within a few weeks, I found that wasn't true. 

One night after I get off work, he tells me he's at the bar with his friends. This isn't unusual. He goes to the bar often with me and our friends and he doesn't drink. He enjoys dancing and live music. It was never a problem. This time though, he told me he'd had a few drinks. I was mortified. I rush to the bar and when I walk in, he seemed very excited to see me. However, after taking a look at my face, realizes how upset I was. He asked why I came. I told him it was to ensure he got home safe. We would talk about it the next day, and the next day he told me it was a one time thing. The next week he dis ketamine, which was also supposed to be a one time thing, but ends up being an all weekend thing and even bleeds into the following week. I'm getting scared at this point. I sit him down and tell him I'm worried. He has gone back on his word multiple times. He stopped going to the gym. He was an MMA fighter and body builder, so that's a big deal. The gym was a big part of his life. He wasn't even training MMA anymore. He was obviously becoming depressed. AFter speaking with him, he agrees that it is a problem and says he'll stop... only I don't really trust him anymore and for good reason.

A week later we were at the grocery store and he admitted to still taking kratom most days. He also admitted to taking Adderall that he doesn't need nearly every day to get through work. \[When it rains it pours, I swear. Because when we moved into the house, he also started a very stressful job. This was to gain experience so he could later head the marketing department of his friend's company. Short term discomfort for long-term gain. That's what we said. However, that happened, then we got the house and then his brother relapsed. That's a lot. \]

I was furious. I didn't want to be furious. When we got home I went on a walk for an hour as to not say something I would regret. I get back and tell him he has broken my trust and I don't know if I believe he will ever stop. This is when things change. He doesn't see it as a problem anymore. He says he'll cut back, but that he's only drinking on the weekends. That was true. He wasn't drunk driving or getting shit faced. That was true. I tell him that kratom is a big problem, because in just two months, he spent almost $1000 on it. Our finances are not combined, but that is substantial. Regardless of how much money you make, why the hell are you spending that much on kratom? 

We didn't really get anywhere with the conversation, but I told him I would leave it alone unless it got dangerous or started impacting me. I would let him figure it out and try to find balance on his own. He was satisfied with this answer. Of course. Probably a bit enabling of me, but I was tired of fighting. 

Fast forward to two weeks ago. My boyfriend goes out with his friends. He gets super drunk, stops texting me and I have to find out from his friend that he passed out on his couch. I am not a controlling person. DO what you want, but tell me what you're doing so I am not worried. The friends he was with are not good influences. They are for sure high functioning alcoholics. When he gets back he told me how much fun he had. He got really drunk.... and did cocaine. Something he said he would never do. I sigh, tell him to let me know what he is doing next time so I don't stay up all night worried. I tell him I am glad he didn't drive drunk, but this was stressful for me. He agreed to inform me next time. 

At this point I am extremely on edge. I have watched him completely give up all his fitness and hobbies and though he wasn't doing kratom everyday anymore, and was only drinking on the weekend, the introduction of cocaine exemplified the change in his perspective. I let it go, until last week.

Last weekend, we go to a resort town in our state with some of his friends. This is about an hour from our home. While we are there, we are drinking and having fun. I stop drinking pretty early because I have a specific tolerance. I am not really paying attention to my boyfriend's drinking and around 1am decide I am exhausted and we either need to stay there or go home. He says he wants to go home. He seems sober and we leave. On our way back he gets pulled over for running a stop sign. The cop doesn't even give him a ticket, but when we get home, he says how relieved he is because he was still drunk. 

I lose it a little bit. I am so completely against drunk driving. I have seen it ruin my friend's lives and my mom has a permanent injury in her spine from a drunk driver.  I tell him he is selfish for putting me and other people at risk. He is smarter than this. He doesn't take me seriously at all. I decide to talk to him the next day. The next day he tells me everyone drunk drives and he was pretty much tipsy and not drunk. I was still furious that he felt comfortable with it at all when we easily could have stayed with our friends. I tell him to never do it again. 

Three days later he finally starts at his friend's company and one night he gets home rather late... with an entire fucking cake. I knew he was drunk. He didn't even have to tell me, but he did. I lose it again, but conclude that I needed to think through our relationship and talk to him the next day. 

When he got home the next day I ran through everything I have discussed in this post. All my concerns, the changes in him and that fact that I have watched him abandon himself and his values. I told him I am morally opposed to drunk driving. I didn't care how he felt about it. To me, it was a deal breaker and I would end our relationship if it ever happened again. I asked him to be honest and tell me if he could commit to nipping this in the bud and ending it once and for all. He said he didn't want to because he didn't see a problem. He got all arrogant, a side of him I didn't see until he started introducing alcohol into the mix. He tells me he'd done lots of things other people shouldn't do. I realize he thinks he's above it. He thinks he would never get a DUI. I look him in the eye and tell him I love him and he's amazing, but he isn't special. He isn't better than people and if he dies, he's just dead like everyone else. I don't know if that was the way to handle it, but I don't regret saying it. That night I went and stayed with my parents. 

The next day, this last Saturday, I come home and talked to him again. He was being sarcastic and trying to say I'm being dramatic. He was even trying to flirt with me. It was confusing and very out of character. I inform him that I don't want to control him, but I know where this is going. I've seen it with friends, an ex and even myself. He tries to flip it on me and say I am being arrogant, but I nip that in the bud, telling him that I am not stupid and gaslighting doesn't work on me. He stops. Nothing was resolved that day. 

Now we get to yesterday. We wake up and go to brunch with his friends. At brunch he makes a drunk driving joke. I wanted to jump out of my seat and slap him. I was so distraught and he was making jokes. We leave and I blew up in the car. This is the first time I actually yelled. I reiterated much of what I already said, but I told him 'You'd rather I break up with you than just commit to not potentially fucking killing people.' 

We pull up and I get out of the car and go in the backyard. He says he's going to his moms. When he gets back 30 minutes later he sits me down and says 'Thought I disagree with the way this has been handled, I will stop. I promise I will never drink and drive or drive high. I cannot promise that I won't drink though. I've been doing it in moderation and I want to see if I can have a normal life"". 

I don't know how to feel. We have been getting along the last day, but I am stuck. I talked to my therapist this afternoon and she told me to stay in the present. I had set my boundaries and if he crosses them, I should leave him. If he doesn't cross them, it's up to me to determine how much I want to put up with. I can't get over his attitude though. The arrogance and the denial. It's insane. It's not the same guy. I'd like to think he will snap out of this. He says he has multiple times before, but that means he's doing something wrong if it keeps happening. I feel like I'm losing him. Not physically, but mentally. I know he loves me and wants to be with me. I don't think he realized how seriously I felt about this until I started yelling. He's lied to me though. I don't think it was intentional at the time, but it still happened. My trust is still broken. I know it could be worth it to stay. OUtside of this, he's just been a miracle for me. I feel like 80% of the time I'm with my soulmate and 20% of the time I'm with his evil twin. I don't want that percentage to grow. I will leave him if he breaks the boundaries I set this weekend. I'm not afraid of that. It just feels like a shame. It hurts really bad. It makes me want to scream into the void.

I just want to know I am not alone in this I guess. I probably sound delusional myself. I don't know what else I want out of it. Someone else to hear this.  Sorry it was so long.

I would imagine that with and increased focus on representation and empathy towards marginalized groups, that people would spend more of an effort understanding how drug abuse really affects people. I Optimistically believe we are all becoming more emotionally intelligent as a society, but for that reason it baffles me that still in so many new movies and TV shows, people who struggle with drug addiction are portrayed as bad people to be avoided and excluded, lest their disorder become contagious and dictate their entire persona somehow.

Example: just watched the movie Their's Somebody Inside Your House - A masked vigilante justifies killing people for racism, murder, greedy land baron-ing, and.... having a fentanyl addiction... Literally that was the only reason the dude got murdered. 
The movie was so focused and intense on being woke (obviously not a bad thing, I'm not trying to steal anyone's representation), so I was really surprised how little thought they put into this guy who is just a victim of an incredibly addictive substance and I was pissed off about the way they just wrote off this guy because he had addiction problems.
I see this nonsense all the time, and people seem to accept it without attempting to understand the root issues  with these victims. I see THIS as a moral failing. Willful ignorance.

At first i used ketamine and 3mmc because it made my life better, it did and i cant deny it didnt. I had good sleep (with etizolam) ate healthy and worked out well (still do). And with the drugs i basically trained better, had better ideas and was much more social and confident. I basically became very charismatic drastically improving my life. But i took it to far when i started giving drugs all the credit and thought it was the road to godhood. Taking 5 tabs of lsd with some lines of ketamine, 3mmc and benzofury. This made me really aware of multiple mainly im a selfish asshole and pretty much invincible. But it didnt end there, later on i snorted 6 lines of ketamine on a school day. I died that day, and wake up in some strangers garden. Im 21 and still living with my mom, nothing wrong with that but im putting my parents through a lot with my impulsive behaviour. Those 6 lines made me go into a flakka like trip and go berserk in q friends house, (after he gave me weed as a replacement for ketamine). Not a good idea lol.

When my sister passed the 3 people she was around left her for dead. They allowed her to lay there for 1 hour and 6 minutes per police report and them telling on eachother. Based off the messages on her Facebook messenger she received the drugs at 12:30. She was discovered at 1:06 per the people she was with. ( her daughters boyfriend and his brother & brothers girlfriend. The drug dealer just so happen to be in the parking lot when the ambulance arrived at 2:14 as if he knew she was going to overdose. There was a voicemail on her daughters phone while she was away and you can hear her boyfriend say”hide the weed and everything” they were cleaning house instead of calling 911.The police will not  hold the 4 individuals accountable and it feels to our family that they look at her as one less addict on the street.

Sober for awhile, I don't know the actual sober date, but I know things are better and going to be better in the long run. I'm also in pain, emotionally anyway. But I consider them growing pains. I do believe alcohol pickles you and leaves you frozen in time, a liquid that induces preserving of adolescence. Retrogression, even. 

My DOC was mainly alcohol, but I would use just about anything else . Today I saw an acquaintances prescription of Xanax and Dextroamphetamine. I relinquished my attachment to the initial compulsion and walked away. He's a good guy, and would probably make an effort to hide such substances for my benefit. Fuck that. No one should have to tiptoe around me. This is my delightful secret, a personal victory and I don't think I'll tell him. 


 I know I can do this on a good day, but today is a hard day and I did it. I swear I'm high off the power I hold, and I truly believe I have more agency than I give myself credit for. On the outside, it sounds as simple as saying ""No."" I know it's not that simple, and I know it's so hard. It is 7:30 AM, and since i'm not drunk or high, I have so much time. I know I said it's like I feel high, but I'm occasionally more than a little depressed, irritable, and sad. I'm 10 minutes from where i get my wine. And you know what? So what. Fuck it. 

I'm going to create, protect and cherish my Sunday. I write this to make my plan tangible, to solidify my desire for change. Thank you for reading. I'm so happy.

I went from maybe $100 a week to well over $1000 at this point. They are my go to when life is getting to me. 

When I wake up tomorrow ill be cranky from the comedown and that will make me think of topping up straight away but I fight it all day then bam I've fucked it again.

Its beginning to affect mypersonal life, my health and job. I'm up all night, sleeping all day, mixing all sorts of substances to the point where I'm surprised I'm alive. 

I have never had suicidal tendencies but today I actually thought about it for a very long time and almost went through with it but couldn't because of the hurt and devastation I would leave behind. These people need me but they need me fixed.

I am not in a position to approach a doctor or go to counselling so I need to deal with this myself, has anyone else experienced this and can it be done? Or am I just wasting my time.

Any information or advice is appreciated, and good luck with your own struggles.

I changed a lot, nowadays I consider myself a new man. In 2018, I got rid of a big weight that was to stop using cocaine, I did what I could to have a different, healthier and much more balanced lifestyle.

 I'm very happy that I was able to stop, but I'm in a different and more difficult phase now, I couldn't stop drinking or smoking, every time I stop, I end up coming back right away, my best was two weeks without drinking and without smoking, but I always come back, this every time with a feeling of guilt and depression for not being able to have this under control. 

After the addiction to cocaine I was destabilized, I had to take my life back, that was hell, faced it all alone without meds or treatment.

I can't get emotionally involved with anyone, whenever I meet someone I always jump out, I don't know exactly why. I've been drinking almost every day lately, I lost my job, I'm smoking a lot too. I'm no longer using drugs. I'm a guy who despite all that followed my life and I want to change. I do not have children. I exercise every day, I run every day, I do meditation, I am eating healthily.
In the past I was a model, I'm 27 years old, I'm a very attractive guy, smart, but I can't connect with anyone anymore because I always feel an inner emptiness that makes me sad when I should be happy, does it make sense?? Tomorrow I'm going to stop drinking and smoking and go back to my life, maybe that's messing up everything. I want a life free from addictions. I want to fall in love again and have a balanced life. What should I do?? I feel like I'm pushing people away with it and that makes me feel worse.

Right now I'm focusing on doing art and studying architecture in college again, doing all the stuff I can to take care of future self. But as I said, without a feeling about it. I know it's hard to understand about that someone that not been a drug addict. My question goes to you that have some time with sobriety, that faced it all alone like me.

While it is only when I drink I do get the urge constantly which leads me to drink and go buy. I would only consume while at parties but now i do it by myself at home constantly. I can't talk to anyone about how i feel in my friend group or family as it will come back to bite me in the ass. The only people I've spoke to are other coke heads and they just tell me they do more so ill be okay.

I quit for a bit after college but once I started getting stress from work and better paychecks, all hell broke loose. I now drink almost everyday and what happens when i drink? My fixation of getting a bag. I know its an insanely stupid drug but i feel happy when i take it and more confident. I don't have a void of depression when I take it and now that I'm hooked, if i don't i feel so shitty. I have never stolen or taken money from anyone to do this. If i can't afford it that week I save and get next week. I love my family and mean no harm to them but if i tell them I'll be a monster in their eyes. Im dying inside mentally and probably physically.

I broke down crying as i finished my last line out of the bag as I heard the birds chirp and my neighbors above me getting ready for work. I'm mentally drained and don't see a way out, its a constant revolving door of me saying ""God Damnit ill never do this again"" to the next day buying more.

If you will, tell me your stories and what changed, what helped, how do i get my life back and not die at the age of 25 alone inside my room. ",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4188969}"

I'm just tired and want to get it out","I don't know what the fuck happened in the last 6 months of my life. Well... I do, but when did I convince myself that my priorities have changed?

I was an opiate addict for many years. Two overdoses, saved by two separate people. Both separate relationships, and two separate traumatic experiences left on others. 

I was clean for over a year before my second overdose, I managed to find an excuse to use though. The relationship I was in, wasn't healthy for many reasons. We have a daughter, she was one at the time. Recently split up, and tried reconnecting after a few months apart.

She had health issues which required daily pain management. Match made in heaven, right? Anyways, after attempting to reconnect I had found out that she graduated and moved on to the needle for a brief time. Not knowing how to handle this information, i seized the opportunity and used it as a great excuse to break a year long of sobriety. Unfortunately, it ended up with myself confused as to why there's five paramedics in my room on Easter morning.

That was my second overdose.

I had lots of clean time afterwards. Split up again, was working lots, got myself a decent place for myself and my daughter that I have half of the time. Life was good, I was clean, had my struggles but I wasn't using anymore.

Fast forward to six months ago. I don't even really like cocaine, never have. I think I may have let my guard down though and forgot I was an addict. I found myself in a situation where cost was not an issue.

Everything felt harmless. I was still working, still had a social life, income wasn't affected. I'm not doing anything wrong, right?

Why do I keep asking myself, how do I break this cycle then? I mean, I know what I need to do, but I find myself slipping back into the same pattern of addiction but justifying it because I've still maintained structure in my life.

I'm just tired of the pull drugs have on me. It doesn't matter if I'm working, the fridge stays full and rent is paid. Theres a part of me absent, and I'm tired of thinking about drugs.

I'm not really looking for advice, or anything for that matter. I just wanted to  vent. I know I'm capable of living a life without spending so much mental energy fixated on instant gratification. I don't want to white knuckle it through some nights, and distract myself. I just wanna live life without thinking about it again",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60706496}"

I fully understand that these medications can be a literal life-savers for many and my intent is not to cast shame upon those who take them for genuine medical needs. This is simply my experience.\*\*

I was a college freshman the first time I took Adderall. Since I can remember, I’ve struggled with math--whether it was a simple multiplication problem or introductory algebra, it just never clicked. Unfortunately, mathematics did not end after high school and was an unavoidable subject on my journey towards a college degree; I was faced with my first college level course on the subject that inaugural spring semester. I had struggled to get by and, despite my best efforts, was faced with the very real scenario where I would fail the class unless I got a B or better on the final. Instead of going to our colleges tutoring center or reaching out to my professor, I followed the advice of a fellow classmate who recommended the drug. 

That first time I took it, I felt like Superman. I stayed up all night studying at my tiny dorm desk. I couldn’t stop studying. I couldn’t stop learning. I was taking it all in. This was fun. I should’ve felt awful; most people do when they don’t sleep. I didn’t. 

Filled with knowledge and unrelenting confidence, I took the test in the morning. I ended up getting the grade I needed. I was hooked. 

From then on, my intake progressed. I  soon discovered how well these tiny blue, pink or yellow pills went with not only studying, but just about everything. Need to study? Take a pill. Going to work? Take a pill. Have a date? Take a pill. Sad? Take a pill. Drinking? Take a pill.

My amphetamine habit went from every once in a while to nearly every day. The occasional 10 milligram pick me up progressed to a 300 milligram addiction within the first year. I would stay up for days on end. With my back drenched in sweat and dark circles tattooed beneath my eyes, I slowly became a shadow of my former self. 

Irritable. Rude. Fidgety. Anxious. Slurred. Selfish. 60 milligram breakfasts and 20 milligram cocktails morphed me into a man I couldn’t recognize. School and work fell by the wayside as I spent hours upon hours staring at my computer screen, trying to find solace in a purely digital existence. I was aware of how bad I looked and how poorly I spoke, and I couldn’t bear to have friends or family see me in such a state. I isolated. The drugs I needed to be social and productive turned me into a wide-eyed recluse, afraid of even the most basic human interaction. 

I started at 20 and didn’t stop until 28. I wasted the majority of my 20’s, my formative years, getting high. I’ve forgotten friends and destroyed relationships. I’ve missed opportunities and lost time. I’ve hurt myself and those I love most. And I’ve been to the broken place, and I’ve felt the shame of not being able to pull yourself from it. 

Was it all doom and gloom? No. I think back and do remember the few times Adderall helped me—acing a test, texting a girl, giving a speech, etc. However, all of that was possible without the drug, and I wish I believed in myself enough at the time to understand that. ",29,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.41812447}"

About 6 months ago I went to rehab for the first time, it was a shitty state-funded institution. When I discharged I also started a year long probation sentence, but chose to start up on Weed, MDMA, Fentanyl, Cocaine, and a lot of Xanax again. I failed my first probation drug test for Fentanyl &amp; THC. That day I decided to commit myself to a more long-term, out of state rehab.

The program I chose had a 12 step based curriculum and was a year long. I was never willing to commit to the year. I ended up staying almost 4 months. During my stay in rehab I decided to hide RC Xanax for some other residents and eventually gave them up to the staff after the people using them got caught. I never used the fake Xanax. 

Two days ago I was kicked out of this rehab facility because I punched another resident I was extremely close with in the arm, purely as a joke. He was bruised badly and the staff found out about the incident.

My parents weren’t on-board with letting me back into the house to live with them and continue my 12 steps (I’m on step 4.) So now I’m living w/ some friends that I didn’t betray in the past, they all smoke weed heavily and drink a bit.

I know that sounds strange and weird thing to include I just add it because the detox center was so terrible. The beds were on cement blocks, which was extremely painful while detoxing from heroin and Xanax. Plus having been in a terrible accident in July where I broke my collarbone (had surgery august 9th, a plate and 11 screws put in), 5 broken ribs and a collapsed lung. On the second day in the detox center I ended up having two seizures from being so dehydrated and having no food. The place didn’t really do check ups on the patients or At least much on me maybe others but my first night there I slept a lot from the meds they gave me and when I woke up I was already very dehydrated and extremely confused and not feeling normal.

 

The worst part is before going in I begged them to tell me the truth about if they had the resources to actually help me with my benzo detox as it was a prescription I was on for 10 years and I read how scary and dangerous the detox from it was. They assured me they were equipped to handle me, but obviously they weren’t. After my first seizure I told them it had to be from my Xanax so they sat me up again to see what would happen and I had a second seizure where I was then taken to the local hospital for the rest of the detox.

 

It was 2 days. They put me on suboxone but I’m still having the worst cravings. I really don’t feel like I got all I needed out of rehab and I feel my trust was broken so much in detox on how they treated me medically. I feel I don’t have the tools I all need to stay clean.

2021-10-06 21:35:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/q2yhbg/boyfriend_relapsing_how_to_react/,Boyfriend relapsing. How to react.,"I just wonder, as addicts and people in recovery, how do you wish people had responded to you?

His last relapse triggered anger in me because he put himself in a very dangerous situation (he had driven somewhere) and refused to tell me where he was so that I could get him safely home.  My extreme worry and anxiety paired with his refusal to tell me where he was…I expressed that as rage.  I had to go back to work (I was supposed to have dinner with him on my lunch break, but he texted me right before I was supposed to leave work to first tell me some transparent lies, then admit he was using) and I was just fueled by anger, probably compounded by the fact that I was had an hour to try to get this done, until I went to bed and, actually, through the night (I moved out last January due to his addiction issues and instability and unreliability and, and, and, so we do not live together anymore). 

That evening as it was happening, after I lost my temper, I just told him not to text or call or anything else. I was returning to work and needed to just get through the next 5 hours.  He didn’t honor that request, of course, but I just picked up and hung up so that he couldn’t leave any distressing voicemails. I told him I would block him if he didn’t stop.  That worked. 

The next morning my anger had melted into tears and compassion and despair and regret and shame over the way I reacted. I went to my therapy appointment with my face swollen from crying, wearing his clothes (I sleep in his thermals and shirts;  a pathetic attempt to feel close to someone who shuts me out so often). I couldn’t even put my bra on. I just left the house in my PJs. 

He is looking at outpatient programs, but has no insurance, so I’m not sure how that is going to work out.  He has been going to meetings, and, ironically, lying to me that he’s at meetings when he’s actually buying and using cocaine. Also ironically, the act of going to a meeting seems to trigger him to go use. Cocaine or alcohol or both. I don’t know what all he does. I can’t expect any honesty from him at this point. I don’t think there’s anything he wouldn’t lie about. I’ve resigned myself to not getting to know or understand anything. 

I’ve let him know that I don’t want to hear from him at all if he’s been using anything at all in the last 24 hours, and I included vaping THC in that. There’s no point in communicating with him while he’s under the immediate effects of whatever.  It’s either word salad or he’s all over the place from
one moment to the next, doing complete 180s because his brain is so fucked. I don’t know if he will respect that boundary or not. 

I would love to be there for him. I wish I were strong enough to cope and be beside him and help him through this. But there’s nothing I can do, it seems. Nothing I’ve done or said over the last 4 years seems to have helped at all.  He says I can’t help him and I do understand that intellectually. It doesn’t stop me from *wanting* to help and be supportive and do the right thing. 

How would you want your partner to react/respond?  What’s the right thing for me to do here?  I text him a few times a day.  Just I love you or something I’ve read re:addiction. Or words of encouragement.  He doesn’t respond. It’s bittersweet because it means he is a) respecting my request/boundary and b) actively using. He did say he was going to a meeting tonight and had picked up someone he usually gives a ride to.  I don’t think he was lying but I have no way of knowing.  I never know anything for sure.

Just some ventilation. I got an explanation once that people like myself are susceptible from birth. Kids like me would eat the whole bag of candy instead of just a handful like many others. Probably many others have heard a similar phrase. This had me thinking for the past years in my struggle to understand my own behaviour in my addiction.

I came to a realization that I am more susceptible to serotonine/dopamine/lucky hormone releases. Let me rephrase that, I think that my brain releases a lot more of those hormones when I take a sip of beer, a toke of a joint or whatever you can think of. But also weightlifting can have that effect, or other ""positive"" things in life.

Finally I came to the conclusion that every day, my brain is looking for me the maximum 'happy hormone' output achievable within the boundaries I have set in my addiction. With whatever means that is. When I did not have access to any drugs or alcohol, I tried 6 aspirine a day. Just to get some release of those hormones. My brain NEEDS it, even longing after a year of abstinence (I am no longer)

I figured addicts and people familiar with this situation definitely exist in the trans community too, so I put it in one of those subs hoping to still get good advice. I got zero responses.*

**TL;DR:** I'm doing my best to remain sober and healthy, and distancing myself from my friends has been a struggle. I have a hard time watching one of them get worse and worse.

&#x200B;

Sigh. So, I consider myself an addict. I don't really have a drug of choice, except weed. That said, I never had a problem with anything beyond that before I transitioned. Once that happened, my work life, social life, and overall situation started getting worse. My transition has otherwise been fine. But in doing so...

I lost most my family and got divorced. I lost all, all of my friends that I had made over 3 decades. I made the mistake of taking a year off working because I didn't want to be in 'transition hell' looking like a hybrid in a skirt in a professional setting (this led to constant difficulty finding work since then).

After losing all these people, I started being taken in by my local trans community. I made new friends, and they are all trans women. I even dated and got engaged to one, a relationship I consider a success despite breaking up. It was mutual and she is still my BFF.

But all of these people have had a rough past, naturally. Many of them had been forced (more or less) into full service sex work (including myself for a few weeks). Suddenly, I am surrounded by people who are trying to cope, and as my eyes are opening, I am coming to realize the coping mechanisms are super bad for me. However, when you are trans, you often do not get to pick who sticks around or wants to be your friend... a dilemma many cis people just don't get, because they think the pendulum always swings both ways when in fact, being trans sometimes is nothing but pain and shit. Its been hard for my current lover (cis) to come to terms with that.

We relatively recently added a girl to our circle of friends, during the Covid lockdowns; we would remain in our bubble of about 5 people (at my place most of the time, because I broke my back and was disable for most of last year.) I am someone who's experienced trauma in ways that make me crave human interaction and I will experience separation anxiety very soon after being alone in a room. This is less of an issue now. Anyway, I became close with her as I have with my other girlfriends. But she has massive addiction issues, and brings those issues around us constantly. I will get back to her in a moment...

Also during Covid, I gained a new lover, a cis male who gives me perspective that I haven't had in 3 years of transitioning. Not only because he has a decade of life experience on me, but because it allows me to interact more outside of the trans bubble and within the general community. I have become less anxious because of him, more ready to get back out there, ready to be healthier. He is a wonderfully positive influence.

Being with him, and him being around my aforementioned girlfriends, has led us to much discussion about becoming healthier, and a big focus of our conversations regards their influence. My ex, the BFF I mentioned, once had far worse drug issues than they do now (although they are rapidly headed back to old ways). Like, forget who you are, forget your name, because you took 20 tabs of LSD in a night. Like meth. Etc. When we originally got together it was a time when I was trying to be sober and off weed. We made it very far (for me that's 2 months), and she loved the positive changes that were coming with it. Even after we broke up, she seemed to be walking the line. Maybe a love drug once a year with a partner, but that's it. I watched her get on her feet, get a wage... very proud at the time.

But again, trans life is difficult for us, and the job couldn't last because the manual labor was fucking up her wrist. So she went back to sex work. This is when the new girl showed up that I said I would get back to...

One day I showed up and she was doing lines of cocaine. Well, I had only tried it twice in my life, and seeing that everyone there was enjoying, I partook. I would always tell people that I didn't like coke because it would just make me mad, and I would end up cleaning my home until 6 in the morning. I also would mention frequently that I could count on my hand how many times I had done it. In a fucked up way I was proud of that. But this time it was enjoyable and we played board games.

Within a month, I could no longer count on one hand, and it was two. Now I cannot say that at all. I started buying my own. I got a whole bunch for my birthday party. Adderall eventually got into the mix  too. They also started on Ketamine (which I refuse because I don't need help dissociating...).

By last month, I became tired of the direction things were going. I want to be in normal society. I don't want this shit affecting me, and more so, I don't want it effecting my friends. Honesty on top of that, I really only care about my ex in this regard for health. So I began distancing a bit, and only doing things with my cis partner. I was supposed to go to a large music festival last weekend that I had been looking forward to for two years now. But, I sold my ex and the new friends my tickets, because I am over being a drug addict, and music festival = drug festival. I also made this decision after those two went to a similar event, and shared their exploits of doing drugs they found on the ground, partying, etc etc, stressful shit for me. They talk about this stuff like its no big deal. When I brought up my concern to my ex (we were talking about coke use)  I was told, ""I think you just have a different relationship with cocaine than I do."" This was infuriating, considering her past, but I know I cannot force people to change, I can only look out for me and offer help. Not that I am the best one qualified.

My ex has been told by many other friends that she is a doormat, which is true; people use her. Now she is being used by the new friend so that they have an excuse to continue the bad behavior and the drugs. I am jealous even, because through all this partying they are becoming ""besties,"" and that means I am slowly losing mine. I love her and always will. Its hard enough to let someone you love go, and this is even harder, because I am witnessing her looking more and more tired, less and less focused, with no regard for anything that actually matters until the last possible moment. Like paying rent for example.

Not to say sex work is bad, its done nothing good for my two friends. You do a bunch of stuff you don't \*really\* want to do, for less than you should be doing it for, all while being used by men who 90% of the time flake on you, and in doing so, leave you desperate for cash. It also equates to more coping, which equates to more drug use, booze, and partying.

\-

I have been getting depressed in the last month or two watching this happen. But my real source of sadness is that I know the only thing I should be doing is keeping myself healthy and making good choices to better my life (and my partner's who just moved in. the guy is a godsend and such a good influence). I am familiar with different addiction programs, I have classically studied psychology, and I KNOW I cannot be around addicts and all of this.

Once again, I am left with just myself and my lover. Thankfully I have them. But I am struggling with the fact that over this 3+ year transition, EVERYTHING GOOD GOES AWAY. And once again, I must lose friends. I wish I could just grab my ex, shake her violently and get across that she needs to stop all of this. I struggle with having made our new friend, only to see that she is the SOURCE of all these bad habits. **Everyone was doing well until she showed up.**

But who am I to try and rip friends apart? The new friend told me recently, maybe a month ago a story. She told me that she was hanging with my ex, and had brought over lines of some sort of nose candy. My ex, seeing the plate of drugs, started balling her eyes out saying, ""I am a drug addict! I can't keep doing this. I want to be healthy..."" And she went to sleep. But since she was on schedule for her hormone injection, she quickly used that as an excuse for being upset, and did the drugs the next morning, kind of ushered by the new girl.

New girl told me this story immediately after asking if she was a bad influence (to which I said, ""yes.""). I wanted to be very mean in that moment, because she knowingly is keeping my ex in this unsustainable modality, even after she cried about not wanting to do it. New friend should have left my ex alone right then and there. But she didn't, the partying has continued, the music festivals have all happened, and its been chalked up to a 'lifestyle' instead of a problem.

Oh, and new friend now lives literally above a god damn bar, and now neither of them get up before lunch since they drink constantly. My ex's work is suffering even more now and I can't do jack shit about any of it without looking like a controlling asshole, and that leaves me fearful of losing her completely.

I had a question about all of this when I started writing, but I now have forgotten. This is my situation. I am doing my best to stay away while remaining a remote friend, but soon I fear I will not be able to watch this go on. Not for my safety, but because I can't watch someone I love spiral like this.

I guess I want to know how people have gotten through this sort of problem. Is my ex beyond saving? All I want to do is get her to see how much of a problem the new friend really is. The best I have done so far is to let her know she may no longer be on my car insurance and I will not be co-signing when her lease is up. She wants me to falsify some income paperwork so she will be able to get a place on her own, but the angry side of me just wants to tell her she reaps what she sows and its not my responsibility. But the outcome of that makes me fearful for her wellbeing just as much.

\-

I will say, despite how much this hurts, focusing on my health, my partner, and frankly, avoiding the sad trans community I have come to know, has done wonders for me. I am going hiking today with a sober friend, and I may start moderating a trans femme support group I used to attend.

I'm a year into recovering from a myriad of shit but I've 100%  knocked the hard stuff: opioids and meth. I've cut back on what once heavy alcohol consumption (I drink 2 glasses of wine once a week) i feel like I'm doing pretty well these days and I'm happy with my progress. 


At 16-17, I was a really sweet, caring kid. Straight A's. I don't think people ever saw much bad in me let alone  me becoming an addict in my early adult life. My friends at the time were absolute phoney's, however. I was receiving screenshots from an anonymous account of what was basically all my highschool friends talking shit. I still have no clue what I ever did to deserve it. The person who made the chat, had actually lived in my family home at some point. She was struggling with her family and boyfriend, so I took her in. Little did I know .. .. ..  These were the people I thought I would grow old with. It shattered me. 

A few months following this, I met my current partner. He had substance issues of his own. I went in with the mindset of, ""I have willpower, I'm going to rescue him!"" but I ended up falling into the trap myself to cope with the pain of losing my social group.

 I thought it would be a bit-o-this, bit-o-that before I started the next semester of my VCE. I went downhill rapidly. I got kicked out within the first week of dating my bf bc I rocked up at my family home on the back end of a five day dexamphetamine/MDMA. Allegedly I got into a fist fight with my sister. I remember nothing, but obviously I believe it happened. I went from 55kg to 45kg in the matter of a month. Dexamph went to meth and then meth went to codeine/endone to cope with the crash and then eventually I was trapped in a meth/heroin cycle. 

I stole from my family. I stole about $600 worth of Ubers from my mum's credit card so I could get to dealers houses. I stole money from my own grandfather's glove box. I even stole dexamph from my partners ADHD/Autistic 11 year old brother during a black out at some point. I had no idea I had even done it until someone told me they saw it happen. 

I only decided to ""get revenge"" on my old friends, but I took it waaay too far. I'd make fake accounts and inbox them and even their families (who had nothing to do with it) straight up abuse and threats. I had gone from a thriving kid to an emaciated, near dead epitome of what a young, drug addicted woman looks and acts like. It still makes me feel sick that I let myself stoop that low so early on in life. 

I lost everyone, even my family who mean the absolute world to me and I no matter how sober I get, how much good I do for the world from this point onwards, I don't think I'll ever know how to entirely forgive myself. Even if others forgive me, there's a voice in the back of my mind that says, ""Don't, I don't deserve it."" 

Me and my partner have started a whole new life these days. We rescued ourselves in the end. We don't talk about our addictions with new people, because we know that it isn't us anymore and we'd hate to be associated that way. It's like this big black stone we keep hidden at our core. Sometimes it hurts, so I'm so happy reddit exists for the anonymity. :)",27,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41363737}"

In 2019 at the peak of my addiction, I had suspicions that my mom was also using meth. I was IVC’d that summer because I had gone into psychosis, after returning home and actually making progress with sobriety I figured I had just been projecting my addiction issues onto her. But during the past year or so, especially lately, she’s been going back and forth between nodding off and being really twitchy and energetic no matter what time it is. I recognized my own behavior from when I was using and did some digging, basically I found and put my hands on proof that she’s using meth, cocaine, and heroin. I am very alarmed and hurt and going through a lot of reflection, this has really been right in front of me the entire time. It’s very triggering for me to just now realize all this, it makes me want to relapse but I can’t throw away these 2 years, and I can’t make this about me because I need to somehow help mom, I really don’t know what to do at this point except vent to strangers on the internet and hope that someone has any kind of advice for this situation.

Here’s the background story. My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months. We’re both 30 years old. He’s been sober from drugs and alcohol use for 1 year and 8 months.


Last weekend he slipped at his best friends wedding. I knew how important maintaining his sobriety was to him and how hard he worked to get there. His family, friends, sponsors, supported him and counted on him. About 2 months ago he stopped going to his AA meetings and started neglecting the people who truly love and care for him. I seemed to be the only person he was giving his attention to. He had some good days but on bad days he had foul mood swings, lying, episodes of pushing me away to the point of break up over minuscule things. He was acting out like a child. It was hard to handle. The communication lacked on his part and almost never wanted to resolve any problem at hand, leaving it to fester and ultimately causing resentment and tension between the two of us. Never overcoming or finding a solution so it would viciously repeat itself. I noticed we were taking steps back instead of forward. If it wasn’t for me the relationship surely would have ended multiple times. In the last couple of weeks, the affection depleted, rarely ever said I love you anymore, rarely had sex, he barely put in any effort and I could feel us getting distant. 


At the wedding last weekend I was his guest as he was the best man. Given he was stressed and under pressure about having to give his speech and entertain everyone, he decided to have “one drink” to take the edge off. Moments later he came to me and admitted to having a drink and that he was feeling extremely guilty about what he had just done. He asked if I was upset with him. I didn’t want him to feel any worse so I reassured it was okay, I wasn’t upset at all and that I was more concerned he would be upset with himself. I wanted him to remain at ease, we had been arguing a lot for a few weeks leading up to the day and I didn’t want him to hold anything against me knowing what a big deal it was that he just basically relapsed. I reminded him that he’s under a lot of pressure being the best man and that it wasn’t a big deal that he had one drink. I asked him if he was going to have anymore drinks and he said that that would be the only drink he’d have. 



Minutes later he gave his speech and it was amazing! He was so happy and relieved afterwords. I could feel he was more relaxed. Shortly after he asked me to go over to the bar with him and have a drink. I was conflicted. He seemed confident he knew what he was doing. I didn’t know if I should stop him, I wanted to but I didn’t want him to feel like I was “controlling” since we’d had an argument about that a few times prior saying I always wanted to be in control, which is not true. I gently reminded him that there were long time friends who were counting on him and as long as he wouldn’t get noticeably drunk or lead him to use drugs, that it would be okay. The night went fine. He only had 4 drinks at the reception.



End of night came and we headed to the air bnb where we were spending the night with the wedding party. Once we got there he made himself a drink. Within the hour he opened up to me about feeling tempted to do a line of cocaine with his friends. Once again, I gently told him no to the drugs, I reminded him that it wasn’t worth it. I joked that he would go all sketchy and quite on me and trip out alone somewhere and totally regret it the next day, knowing I would be the one to have to deal with his ramifications. He agreed I was right and that he wouldn’t do any cocaine.



About an hour later we partnered up and started a game of beer pong and at the start of the game he admitted he had just done a line. Deep down I was upset but I masked my anger so that I wouldn’t bad trip him. In all honesty, I don’t know if I enabled the behaviour or not, I figured there was nothing I could have done, regardless if I put my foot down or not, he would still do what he wanted and if he didn’t, he would resent me for holding him back. I said what I thought was the right thing to do, the rest was on him. In the middle of the game he disappears and doesn’t come back. Let down, I finished the game without him. When I went looking for him I found him in our bed, laying in the dark. Almost in tears, he asked me to come lay next to him and we fell asleep. About an hour later around 3am he got up and left the room. He didn’t come back till after 6am, tweaking, saying how high he was. I was so disappointed. I knew he would hate himself.



Next morning he couldn’t wait to get the heck out of there, anxiety through the roof, depression already kicking in. A few days went by and the depression, guilt, anxiety progressed and so did his irritability towards me. I could tell he was trying his best to show me love and affection but he would also get easily annoyed, push me away, his behaviour was off, It was horrible how he was treating me sometimes and how I was feeling. It was evident something wasn’t right.



Last night we had made plans to go out for dinner since we hadn’t really done anything special in awhile. The plan was that he’d pick me up at my house and head to the restaurant together. When he called later that afternoon it was as if he completely ignored our plans and says to me “You’re coming over right?” Not acknowledging our plans for dinner. I got upset and explained we had made plans for dinner. I wish he would just have communicated he didn’t want to go out for dinner and that he just wanted to stay in, I would have totally understood but instead he picked a fight with me and decided he wanted to break up with me and that it was only temporarily. He said lately we’d been arguing too often and that he needed some space. That he’d been treating me poorly and that I deserve more. That it was best if he ended things for now and that he would understand if I didn’t want to wait around for him to figure his **** out. He began to cry and vent about how he doesn’t even know who he is anymore and that he can’t bare to look at himself in the mirror. That he’d been lying to everyone around him and he needed to come clean about what he did. Keeping me around would not be fair to me cause he needs to be selfish right now and can only think about himself. That he needs to get back on track with the AA program and start the steps again and that it’s a matter of life or death for him. I tried to talk to him about not ending the relationship and that whatever he was going through, I wanted to go through it with him. I said there was no way I would wait around and that if we broke up, that was the end. 



We met up that evening, he was a mess. I asked him to reconsider and he stayed firm in his choice saying he needed time to get back on his feet, that he’s not happy with himself. We said our goodbyes, cried it out and went our separate ways. Devastated about the whole thing. 



This morning I got a text from him saying “I’m sorry Em, I did this just as much for you as I did for me. You deserve so much better babe and I know you’ll find it. Take care of yourself xo” and I have yet to respond. 



I feel so defeated in all of this. The obvious thing to do is to let him figure it out on his own. I want to respect him and honour his wishes. Is there a way I can remain in his life withought getting in the way while he gets back on track? If anyone has any advice for me, if you’ve ever experienced anything like this before, I would love some feedback on what I should do. I love him and I have hope this can be salvaged. Appreciate all the feedback!



Thank you in advance and I hope everyone is having a magical day. Bless you!

I was already feeling so bad that I decided to go to sleep early, but here the problem started ... I couldn't sleep, the headache and the temperature made me feel very uncomfortable, so I couldn't fall asleep, and that only increased the headache and discomfort, which increased the insomnia, and so it continued like a growth cycle, a cycle that was stressing me more and more, and well, from my experience I know that stress plus deadtime can lead to An anxiety that can make you relapse. .

But I didn't want to relapse, not again, so I literally went into a mental battle for 8 HOURS trying to hold my ground, trying not to burn out from stress, trying to ignore temptation, avoiding anxiety, just trying not to relapse. , with no distractions (like the phone or something) and / or some way to reduce pain or sleep to support me, it was just me.

I'm not going to lie to you, I literally started hallucinating and delirious, I got to a point where I forgot who I am, it was hell that night ... But I won, I didn't relapse, I made it.

Since then i have been trying harder than i ever have to quit but i keep going 1-3 days sober at great distress only to then find myself back in that high again.. and every time i use even though 30 seconds ago this was the only thing i wanted in the world once that high hits all i can think of is how much I regret doing it and how in the end its not even worth it….. i used to play football and work out with the team every day and now my arms look like twigs. And i have always struggled with depression i think every addict does but while that high makes it all go away it comes right back harder than before when you come down. Thats how you stay addicted thats how i stayed addicted at least. And today i ended my best sober streak yet because i cannot eat anything. Its been days and i have been getting a good at home workout every day im sober but yet i cant for the life of me force food down when im not high… it sucks i get very sick just looking at food. I woke up today sober and make myself an egg sandwich thinking i would be able to at least eat my favorite breakfast food but one bite hurt so much it brought me to tears……. Like….. and so here i am high again and i feel like such shit so i have to post this i have no one to talk to/ help me all of my friends are on the same thing as me.. i am going to try my absolute hardest to kick this.. i had so many hopes and dreams as a kid.. i dont expect anybody to read through this this post is more for me than anything but if anybody finds themselves staring at that packet know its not worth it and know that you are not alone and know there is a way out ive been inspired by the stories on this subreddit and i want nothing more than to come back and make a 1 year sober post.

From far off, they look like beautiful shooting stars, but in reality, they're nothing more than prisons, where each of us is locked up alone, going nowhere. When the orbits of these two satellites of ours happened to cross paths, we could be together. Maybe even open our hearts to each other. But that was only for the briefest moment.

I was in rehab in 2017 when I came across these words from Murakami's Sputnik Sweetheart. And it was around this time that I met Yash. His kindness and empathy shone brighter than the sun, bringing warmth and joy to everyone it touched. I can still hear his laughter every time I close my eyes.

This might be why I've yet to fully come to terms with his passing. I've accepted that his decision will never make sense to those of us who knew him best. We can only take comfort in knowing that he's no longer in pain.

Serenity Prayer is my meditation on the relationship between pain, suffering, mental health and addiction. It is written with the deep understanding that pain is inevitable, while suffering is optional.

I swear my parents used to really love me.","Just to lay this out as a simple hypothetical, we can put it like this...

&#x200B;

Let's say for whatever reason my psychiatrist and regular doctor have agreed that I'd benefit from an Adderal script to go along with the suboxone.  Helps keep energy levels, mood, motivation etc 

As a result, all illegal/casual drug seeking behavior ceases because the shifty, bored, anxious feeling that inspired it is preempted by the help of said adderall.  

So now, let's say five years later, I'm still taking both of those but in those five years I've had exactly two drinks, went from smoking pot daily to twice yearly (birthday, christmas) and even found myself four years clean from cigarettes.

Also, I'm never in a situation where I need a refill early.  As prescribed has been perfect.

All sounds great, right?

Here comes the tricky part:  Do you throw this whole process out, call it a failure, switch my label from ""Successfully coping with/recovering from addiction"" when you find out that sometimes I like to take my last dose of the day up the nasal passage rather than down the throat.

It gives me a sense of being in charge of me, rather than a pinball bouncing between various state agencies and private medical practitioners.  I look forward to settling at my desk, doing this, and then working on a project/doing research, competing in a variety of tournaments in the realm of my hobbies etc.

Basically, I'm asking, do I and does a person in this situation in general, lose the right to talk with pride about kicking heroin?  My family is filled with people who are currently alcoholics (drink until unconscious every night - but consider it not a problem because finances are stable)

And when I mention my sobriety with pride, it hurts me in a way that I didn't know was possible - as I struggle with their attempts to discount that sobriety on account of being aware that I'll snort my meds on occasion.

Well the snorting and the fact that I'm open about how adderal does everything for me that I ever really wanted from pot or h.  I just wanted the energy/motivation to do the things that I already wanted to do.

Given this drinking happens every single night, and four out of seven days involves driving.. On occasion I express concern about their safety.  However I'm met with rage, indignation and threats to inform anyone, everyone, my doctor - pharmacy or whatever that Ive snorted my adderal.  Seeing someone fall down drunk and having them insist that I'm exactly the same as them.. especially that coming from my mother - and for the vast majority of my life an amazing mother. 

 Just less amazing and more cruel since the drinking got intense, shockingly willing to hurt me in a way that even my schoolyard adversaries abstained from. Just recently there was a nice six hour period where my electricity was disconnected and she just repeated something to the effect of ""i can't believe my son is such a fucking piece of shit. you're scum""

Once would have scarred me for life given my first 35 years, she was a flawless mother and the foundation of my belief in myself.  But her drunkenly repeating it over and over, while mocking me as I pleaded for her to just turn my electricity back on.  It's like possession.

I was forced to quarantine with her and in the past six months she basically humiliated and otherwise undid the prior lifetime worth of quality emotional/mental care.. Leaving me now doubting not just my self worth, but my intelligence, and on a core level.. just genuinely convinced of my own lack of value.  I put a healthy relationship with an always sober, super responsible person built over five years on total pause.  Just stopped speaking to her because not only not wanting to inflict myself upon her but also not being able to stand my reflection in our interactions.

(She asks what's wrong, I don't want her to even be thinking about wrongs, just to be care free and happy like she's earned)  Or she wants to do a thing and I just have zero ability to focus, which makes me even more focused on feeling worthless.

I could have better protected myself from my mom if she'd been an abusive alcoholic my whole life.  But springing it on me when I'm already moved in and having moved in figuring it'd soothe some recent anxiety and generally would help me focus on accomplishments rather than mistakes like she always has.  

The end result feels like the broken tailbone you get when you go to take a seat in a chair that you are 1000% sure will be there, and instead someone pulls it out from under. Shocked, confused, and unsure if this is just what I deserve. 

I know I'm meant to be a grownup and such, but I guess I took for granted that my mom would always love me and that the healthy relationship we'd always had would continue.  When I try to explain to her that this scenario leaves me spinning out because my family was a major pillar of my recovery she accuses me of lying to manipulate her or basically saying whatever I have to to ""win"".  She doesn't understand that from my view everyone already lost - and winning would only take the form of her not demanding I pretend her drinking is fine.  It was always a rule not to comment on how many she's had even when she wasnt a problem drinker.  That rule has turned into what now might be a fatal flaw in the whole dynamic.

I'm sorry I rambled, with the bottom falling out of my family and me alienating everyone else, I just feel very alone.  On the bright side, I haven't drank. Wont be doing any opiates, five years clean from H.  At least five, maybe six or seven.  But those aren't helping me feel any less awful or trapped or helpless.

Sorry for my grammar mistakes, English is not my mother tongue.

I am unsure if this is the right place to ask for help.

For context: my friend has a BPD (borderline personality disorder) and also was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. They used to be addict to recreational drugs (weed and speed) when they were younger teens but stopped. 

Now the last 4 months they started to get very bad, and the last month they started doing legal drugs, meth (not everyday but she do not want to tell me how much) and drinking alcohol. She drink alcohol with legal drugs in class. She also drinks everyday. She refuses to go to a therapist. 


Does anyone have any advice about how to handle something similar?

I hope it is okay to ask this here. 

My brother's life has been going downhill for the past few years. He suffers from depression and addiction (alcohol, weed, gambling). He's recently hit rock bottom (no where to live etc).

The problem has been that he's so angry about everything and hasn't really been willing to get help. I have just been trying to slowly rebuild rapport with him, trying to gradually convince him to accept help. Rehab/therapy. 

What's the best way to approach someone in such a situation with help? Some have tried tough love and ultimatums, but hasn't worked. I'm basically his last raft. How do I help him? I am at a loss. I would appreciate any suggestions.

Its Wednesday august 25 2021 5:14 am I sit here in my room and wonder when will life feel normal again its been only a few days since I stopped using delysm and I already feel emtpy again brain fog fills my days and I just wanna feel normal again. Smoking is one thing but dxm is another shit had me miserable  it was like everyday it was a goal to go steal more. It got to the point I couldnt wake up and function normally my thoughts were blurred and I couldnt remember the past 24 hours. Now just imagine that but daily and sometimes wouldnt be able to see or walk. It was like I was actively killing myself. I never thought I’d be one of those junkies stealing delsym ever second I could but thats what I was. I thought I was gonna drink myself to death but realized I gotta stop somehow did only took all my will. The breaking point was all my friends as they saw me deteriorating infront of them they tried to ignore me but I was really bad. They confronted me and called me out this was the first time I’ve  felt anything in months and it was them calling me out for being a no life junkie it hurt. I decided right then and there that night I had to stop. Wouldn’t it havent been for my friends I don’t believe I’d be here today I was completely shutting down from this shit. I mean for real dying seriously dying and I’m only 19 don’t ever try it unless u know you can control youself. Shit is the most common house hold drug and if u like the effects ( euphoric, happy, dislocative) stay away I promise youll become the most hooked like if you were on a heroin or ketamine and the withdrawals omg dont even get me started. Welp anyways started my fluoxetine hopefully this is a new start a fresh start to getting out of depression because delsym just keeps you in it debate me on it but that shit great and dandy until you cant function and only are happy/functionable when on it. This stuff im taking now appartently will kill me if I try and get high off Delsym and or gel caps so glad I’m taking it anyway anyone who wants updates on this fluoxetine and if this post seemed brain dead probably because how slow and dumb I am after all the sludge I’ve consumed lmk hopefully this helped someone stop and think feel free to ask questions.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7212807}"

Ever since I was young (I’m 27 now) I’ve had problems with my sinuses. My mum used to put vapour rub under my nose at bedtime cos I couldn’t sleep. When I was 12 I had the worst cold, and I used a decongestant nasal spray containing oxymetazoline and it was a revelation, I could breath - all the time. I still use it, I have stopped for weeks at a time and it made no difference, Even without using it for weeks my nose never felt clear. I visited the doctors numerous times and was eventually told I need a septoplasty as I had a deviated septum. That was around 5 years ago, I had the operation, I didn’t use it for 3 months and nothing changed. Still constantly blocked up, sinuses inflamed, headaches etc. The doctor said if it was genetics that caused my deviated septum there isn’t much they can do, whereas if it was an impact injury then I should have no further problems. Anyway, after 3 months of having the op and still being unable to breath I used it again and now here I am. I use it regularly throughout the day, I panic when I don’t have it, ive missed social events because of it and I start work in 3 hours and haven’t been to sleep yet because tonight is bad, I’m sleeping on the couch tonight so I don’t wake my fiancé up with constant sniffing lol. I know I shouldn’t have used it for more than 3 days due to rebound congestion, hold my hands up that is my fault. My question is what is the best way to stop this, I hate it. I feel anxious, it’s depressing knowing that when I do go to sleep I’ll be awake within a few hours cos my nose is blocked up again. When I get the cold it feels like a “mini flu”, if I try to stop I end up with a cold within a few hours which floors me due to the intense congestion/lack of sleep/sore throat/headaches. It is miserable. 
I have tried doing one nostril at a time but sadly my nose seems to not have it, the nostril not being “dosed” tends to block up so intensely it causes the spray to be ineffective on the other nostril and I end up with the cold. I really want to stop this and I have a few days off work coming up and I’m determined to try and use these days to get the worst of it out the way. Is it best to go cold turkey or try diluting it with saline solutions? 

I genuinely can’t keep this up, sometimes I’m in the supermarket in the middle of the night cos I’ve ran out and it’s becoming a joke. I feel tired 24/7 due to severe lack of sleep, sleeping tablets don’t work as I wake up at the same time with the same problem just compounded by the fact I’m groggy and drowsy. I appreciate this may sound pathetic as their are people on this subreddit battling hard drugs and props to all of you, but this is a genuine problem and it’s seriously impacting my quality of life.

I’ve recovered from coke and alcohol (3.5 years sober now). It was hard but I did it. 

And honestly a masturbation “cross addiction” helped me do it. **But now masturbation has become harmful in my life.**

Sometimes I do it 3x a day for many hours at a time. And I’m at the point where I can’t get hard with a real woman. I used to be able to but I can’t anymore and I strongly believe it’s cause I masturbate too much, been doing it for too long, etc., that my brain is seriously out of whack sexually. 

[Even viagra doesn’t help that much. (And my T levels and all other hormones are fine so I really think this is the issue)]

**ANYWAY,** honestly Im really struggling to quit this one. I think the issue is that I’m not in enough immediate pain/suffering from it. 

When I was drinking almost half a handle every day the pain was so acute and the damage was so direct that I eventually realized I *had* to get help. 

But this masturbation thing, yeah it sucks. I hate not being able to get it up with a woman. And I hate that it eats big chunks of my day. 

But it isn’t really affecting my relationships with friends/family. And it isn’t hurting my income or my health the way drinking was. I have and could keep doing this and it wouldn’t really harm me in a serious way like drinking would. It isn’t the same level of suffering to me. 
Nevertheless I want to get over it because it does suck.

**TL;DR—i’m 3 years sober, but now have a masturbation addiction. I got over alcoholism because I could leverage the suffering it was causing me and the people I cared about—I *had* to change. But with masturbation I merely *want* to change. It’s not a necessity to me. So I struggle.**

I have been best friends with a girl I met in 5th grade. she helped me when I got bullied and stayed with me for a long time.

Sadly, in the recent years, she got caught up by addiction. She is an alcoholic. at least I think that.
She gets a lot of alcoholic drinks when we are together, she drinks them all in one sitting (its a lot fo beer and also stronger liquor). She also wakes up, when she would sleep over at my house, and starts drinking beers until I wake up. 
She also falls asleep in places outside and then doesn't know where she is, when she wakes up. Last time it happened, me and my bf looked for her and we luckily found her.

Last time she was here, she did it too. She woke up, drank and when I woke up, she was halfway drunk. She sadly also didn't eat breakfast, just drank her beers. She started to cry suddenly, bc when she gets drunk, she starts to insult her bf. She said she regrets doing things like that, but she doesn't know how to stop.

And I'm just worried sick for her. I know it shouldn't be like this. She deserves better. But all I could do was hold her.
I held her, carried her to bed and stayed with her until she fell asleep again. She was sober afterwards but I was just so worried. It was the last day we have met, since she lives in another city. This was a few months ago.

It so easy to understand yet so hard to do. If ever I never knew / tasted all this stuff...

I know almost everyone here will say it too much...go one thing at a time etc...but it just does not work....

That ONE THING brings back the whole of body / mind fucking altering substances. If I start playing an RPG again it brings back beer and beer brings back caffeine and caffeine brings back benzos etc...

Why cant my UNCOUSCIOUS SELF cant understand that IT BAD and we dont need all that crap in our body.

I have a plan right now guys. My buisness can work by itself (it going to be shit...but still better than nothing). 

So I rented the most remote place possible.... no cellphone (landline is there for emergency)...no internet...no money...no car (one of my guy will leave me there). I am going there 3 weeks with only books, food and water. It 2 hours car ride so no quickfix anywhere to be found.

When I first met the demon I was 16, I was just a dumb teen smoking cigs, cigars, and weed thinking I was on top of the world.. invincible even. One day one of my buddy’s moms boyfriend stopped over. He saw us smoking weed and chilling. He told us that there was a legal drug that could make us “trip”. We were novices when it came to substances, so we of course were very interested. The next day my friends got to do it because I was busy with my mother. Trust me I was pissed cause I wanted to experience it with them. (Later in life I would realize they weren’t really friends). They tripped hard they told me, so of course me being the extreme addict since birth was going to do it. They said only to take 8 mucinex pills but me being who I am I wasn’t going to do that, I told myself I ain’t no bitch so I took 20 my first time. Instantly I was hooked. I don’t remember much from that first time but that’s why I liked it. It covered up my trauma. It took away my emotions, thoughts, and even my ego and soul. I’ll save some reading, basically after that day I was taking atleast 8 of them everyday. By the time I was 18 I was at 20 different psych wards for overdosing on the pills. For a couple years (17-18) every time I would take pills I would try to KMS. By the time I was 20 I had attempted suicide over 50 times, been to the Er for overdosing over 100 times, diagnosed with early onset chrones, and my right ventricle enlargement. My brain has suffered too extremely, I can barely read out loud and I have trouble talking and thinking. I’ll end it with this, please nobody try it or do it. I know most people say “it’s a good experience” but it’s just too easy to land where I was at. Fuck dxm, I’m glad I can wake up sober. Thanks for reading

If I forgot a line trying to recite it, I had to start from the beginning and recite it again from the first line.

it was long and tedious. I felt like I was pushing a stone up a cliff, and it always rolled down with every mistake I made. that didn't take me far.

my mother taught me: ""if you mess up, don't go back to the beginning. keep reading it. mistakes don't mean that you have to repeat everything again""

so I did that. reading the poem again and again, never stopping if I messed up, I just kept going. Every time I read it, I got better at it. 

It's not easy. but you have to keep going. you have to keep going again and again, after every relapse, after every mistake, after you feel miserable. those things don't reset your whole progress. but you need to keep going. you need to keep going until you are at the point where you want to be.",16,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4456148}"

I worked very hard at my recovery, it was not easy. I had to go away for treatment, see doctors and physicians daily, and go to meetings.. as this was happening my boyfriend was still in active addiction. He understood that we were at different points in our lives but I believe he did miss our time using together. 

After 5 and a half months clean and sober I had relapsed. It was my decision (of course) but it was out of no where.. 

Since then I had tried to stopped multiple times, I have been going to all the types of recovery meetings , I have been reaching out to people and trying to make friends or meet people who have been through what I have been through, reading literature and being physically active. Despite this I am still so sick.. I use everyday.. and even more then I did before.. and now I have gotten myself into an even worse place.. I have always had an issue with my DOC and been able to rid all other drugs from my life. 

Well a few days ago, a friend of my boyfriend and I had come to stay with us for a few days until he can move into his new apartment. This friend of ours also uses. I didn't really think twice about his usage because my mind is back to that sick obsessed, constant need for more that it used to be. Anyway this friend and I have the same DOC except he does his a different way then I. His method of injection is much more dangerous and something I had sworn I wouldn't do. Well you guessed it I tried it and  since that day I have not been able to stop.. I thought things were bad before but somehow I dug myself even further down. 

I am supposed to be going to a rehab at the end of the month. In order to go I need to have 3 weeks clean first. I really need this. I don't want to leave my boyfriend but it might be the only way to save myself.

I have started giving my “leftovers” to my friends to hold at the end of a night out. When I buy it I get the minimum amount, and I do not re-up. If I don’t have the money for it, I do not use. I have called in sick to work due to using the night before. I have lied to my partner about using. I feel so ashamed when these things happen.

He had mental health problems, which turned into addiction problems, which he kept at controlled level for many years, but due to covid he slipped deeper and deeper. He regularly smoked weed, took coke, most painkillers and was drinking most days and nights. He has a beautifu soul and at his core he was a wonderful, caring person but couldn't shake things from his childhood, I tried for decades to give him all the love and support I could but Im not a professional and i couldn't convince him to go therapy. His whole family regularly take drugs and have there own problems with addiction. I'm pretty much the opposite, I've tried this and that when I was in my twenties but never took anything regularly, I drink but only socially. 

I've spoke to the few people about our kids and that I'm worried they will have addiction problems when they are older. Both of them are much like him both in personality and physically. Everyone i have spoke to say, the difference between there dad and your kids is my kids have me and a stable home life, I don't take drugs ect so there's nothing to worry about. Personally I feel think that's more to reassure me more than anything. Yes my kids have a stable home, I work and when I'm not working Im with them, but they have still lost there daddy at young age and even if I was a super mum, I'm a strong believer that dad's are just at important, especially the brilliant dad he could be, when he was able too.

I'm a long time klonapin user (30 years) after being prescribed for insomnia that was not responsive to other treatments. I started at .75 mg (one and 1/2 point 5 tablets) and 30 years later was at 1.25 (2 and 1/2 point 5 tablets).

I recently started to taper by snapping the 1/2 tablet in to 2 quarters and throwing one quarter out. That was ok at first but 2 weeks later for whatever reason im feeling super explosive, even though thats a ridiculous small reduction (ie .125 mg)

IF YOU HAVE TAPERED from klonapin please tell me: did you have a DELAYED reaction to the taper like this or heard of it before? Because it could also be something else. The pandemic feels like its caging/closing in on me, and I have some projects that have gone sideways.

ALSO IF YOU HAVE TAPERED did you consider asking doctor for oral disintegrating tabs? Apparently they come in .125 mg which would make things easier.

Only problem with tabs is I'm a bit reluctant to bring doctor into my tapering plan bc I think she'll just decide to reduce the RX as a nice quick way to push along the taper. She's unsympathetic.

And , I can't get another doctor. I have yet to have a doctor who thought there would be any problem because ""your not taking much anyhow""",4,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4961096}"
