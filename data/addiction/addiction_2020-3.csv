Ready to have a normal life but having difficulty saving. Looking at Sober living Homes. What's been your experience with them? Things to look out for? How'd you face the fear, if any, of going into one?

I've been homeless, living in a car/van for 3 years. I went homeless by choice, as I was getting kicked from families house, I grew interested in the van dwelling movement. Didn't have a van at the time but I had a car and for me that was good enough. Within 6 months I had a van. The problem was I was already drinking a lot before and had a heavy kratom addiction. Any plans I had of being a successful, hip, traveling van dweller went out the window. A year and a half in I unintentionally detoxed from alcohol not knowing what I was getting myself into. After that terrifying experience, things only went down hill. 

Here at this point in time, I've been sober from alcohol 3 months. I'm still taking a moderate amount of kratom but I'm slowly getting off of it. I'm also detoxing off another legal substance called Phenibut that I quit 3 days ago. I'm ready to get somewhere normal again. I work and have a decent income but still have not been able to save. A friend of mine is in a sober living house and recommended that I give it a try since many are low cost and do not require a significant deposit. 

I have a list of sober living houses that I'm going to call tomorrow and get more information about. One thing I'm reluctant about though is the part of living with other people and having roommates, sometimes multiple. I've lived on my own for the past 7 years. In the last 3 years I've isolated myself to greater and greater extremes and pushed all family and friends away. One might say that this has made me very socially awkward, unruly, and inept, even more so than I was before. 

All this to say, I really love the idea of a sober community, the camaraderie, reintintegration skills, and support that one of these homes would offer but I'm super afraid. Be it, the lingering effects of detoxing, the kratom, or just my own fears, it's pretty intense. When I'm afraid of things I withdrawl and avoid them. That's why I'm an addict. I don't want to run anymore. I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I want a home again. I want a normalish life again. I want to know what ot feels like to be sober for long periods of time and deal with the real issues. I want recovery.

I know this is kind of long but those of you who got to the end; If you've been in a sober living home or halfway house, what was your experience like? If you were afraid going into it, what helped you to face it? Did the overall experience at the sober home benefit you in the long run? Any thoughts on things I should be looking for in a sober home?

I have had some people tell me it's best to just be honest and something like that will be fine. While others have said if you admit to getting something on your own or are specifically asking for something because you know it works for you, these things might disqualify you. I tend to believe the former based on what I have heard from people. I have met countless people who do not use buprenorphine as directed, so it seems unlikely they would turn someone down looking to do it by the book.

Late November 2019-January 26th 2020
-I noticed my husband had been acting different. He was here, but he didn’t seem really “here”, if you know what I mean. He wasn’t eating, he couldn’t perform during sex. He kept “falling asleep” at his mom’s house. I kept asking him what was wrong because we kept getting into arguments and that wasn’t normal for us. I kept begging him to tell me what was wrong because I knew he wasn’t being normal. He kept telling me I was manifesting things inside of my head. The whole week of Christmas we kept fighting because he kept disappearing at night. Christmas Day was a disaster because the fight we had gotten into was terrible and he was so ready to leave me.

January 26th, 2020
-It’s our 4th anniversary. I wake up and he’s not home. A couple hours later he shows up with gifts. Tells me that he’s going to go with his sister to the store because he needed to replace a part on her car. He told me to hang tight because he’d only be gone a couple hours. So I’m waiting and hours pass by. I’ve been calling him and texting him wondering where he was. It’s 5pm, then 6pm, then it’s 9pm. I’m angry and hurt at this point. I called his sister and she said he had left hours ago, around 2pm that day. She goes out to look for him and finds him laying down on the picnic table behinds his moms house. She said that he was sweating a lot, and his eyes were weird.

He finally comes home and tells me that he’s been addicted to molly. I get the feeling he’s lying so I keep pressuring him and he admits that he’s been using meth for almost 2 months. He stops using it and fast forward to the past couple days. He’s been acting strange, I noticed he hasn’t been sleeping for the past 2 days. Yesterday he went to go “vacuum” the car for 3 hours? When he came home he was sweating a lot. Even inside the house. It’s cold in our house and he was sweating. He was acting funny too. How can I deal with this? How can I find out if he’s using again?",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985894560813904}"

Once on a friday, another last Tuesday.  Thankfully, I was home sick last week (not with Covid-19), so it was easy for me to be active in helping create deterrents (ensuring he didn't have cash on him, keeping him company, etc) and help with taking it one day at a time (making sure he kept his \[virtual\] therapy appointment, making myself available and supportive to conversation, etc).  


He has spent the past week basically asleep and low energy.  I know he feels a lot of shame and guilt and is likely in a depressive episode.  He already has issues that go untreated like Asperger's and ADD that he has to struggle with when not detoxing.    


I'm not sure how much I should push on him to get back to ""normal"".  He usually does most of the cooking, cleaning, dog care, etc as I make more money.  On top of that, his job is closed due to the virus where I am still at work, so he has literally all day to do whatever, which I know is more of a curse than a blessing.  Being that only 2 other people work in my office, I'm still going to my desk, so I'm not at home.  


He has been doing very little of the daily routine stuff that is his ""job"".  The first few days I understood as he detoxed.  The next few days I let slide because I'm trying to be understanding.  But I just popped back home and he's taking a nap after only being awake for a few hours.  In my head, I think he should be getting ""back to it"", but I don't want to apply stress that could lead to a relapse.  At the same time, I don't want to let things slide like just because he relapsed, he's allowed to dip out of the responsibilities of life while his body heals.

He's a very smart guy, introverted, has a great white collar job. He is on a number of prescription medications, and has been on many over the years, I can't even begin to name them all but mostly related to depression, anxiety, sleep aids. I was surprised recently to learn he is now on lithium as well.

He abuses these drugs. He mixes and matches them, he overdoses on them. When his doctor won't prescribe he'll just buy them from other countries and abuse them. The drugs make him like a zombie. He's had one incident after another where he's passed out in public or crashed his car due to driving in a complete haze, he comes to and can't even remember how he got there.

He's had therapists, psychiatrists, he's been to a short-term inpatient facility. I don't know what's next. I really worry about his survival, he's endangered his life many times (unclear if intentional or not) and is clearly on this destructive path. Even when everything seems to be going good/improving we'll suddenly find out he was taken to a hospital after taking 8 sleeping pills and passing out in a McDonalds.

I worry about his life and don't know what we can do to help. I can't make any sense of why even when things are going well, he just gets ""bored"" (his own words) and decides to experiment with a drug cocktail.

2020-03-30 01:52:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/frl97k/hating_myself_for_wanting_to_get_high/,Hating myself for wanting to get high,"I started using cocaine on an almost daily basis around December 2017 after a bad breakup and moving back to my father's house. I turned 19 at the end of that month.I lost my job that I loved, but thankfully was able to kiss my manager's ass and get it back. I spent every night out until dawn or later, getting high, and when I ran out, just avoiding going home for my father to see me strung out. In Feb/March 2018 he kicked me out. I dont know if he ever knew about the coke. I lost my job again, under new management, and decided it was for the best as I needed to quit the drug habit. Unfortunately the guy I did coke with had a thing for me and had no problem supplying it, and gas money, cigarettes, weed, food, whatever I wanted basically. 

In May of that year, I met the love of my life. Despite being jobless, I was the happiest I'd ever been. I was in love. The friends I was living with made me feel more at home than my family ever had. My friend, the mom, had dealt with her own addictions and wild times in the past and was okay with me being out until whenever. They drank and smoked regularly, and I'd already had a daily smoking habit, so we had good times. Then our electricity got shut off. Then we got evicted.

I moved in with my boyfriend, still jobless, and ended up horribly depressed. Being away from the family I had adopted as my own was hard. It was a 45 minute drive, and I had no money. My boyfriend was also a daily smoker, so any money that didn't go to bills and food went to enough weed and cigarettes to get us through the week. I mooched off him for months, and I still went out with the guy that got me coke. This affected my boyfriend more than I realized, until after I got clean. He would start arguments just to keep me home when i was about to go out. I couldn't resist cocaine, but i couldn't resist a shouting match either. 

November 1st, 2018, I went to jail. I'd been on probation for marijuana/paraphernalia posession and genuinely did not believe that the courts would bother to lock someone up for that. I did a little over 30 days, as when my PO showed up I had very obviously been self harming recently, so I got resentenced and sent to therapy. I went right back to smoking. Kept doing coke whenever I could. Relationship was still bad.

March 2019, I get my job back! Job=money=coke. Fortunately it was usually just once a week. Boyfriend and i were still fighting. Nothing was going well. He has some problems in the bedroom most likely due to his type 1 diabetes, and the fact that in almost a year we had never had sex was getting to me. I cheated on him. Told myself I couldn't do it again. Did it again. Ended up getting involved with a guy from work. Boyfriend found out. Things got worse. Long story short, shit went very downhill, and he kicked me out. Two days later I failed a drug test and went back to jail, May 15th, 2019. My resentencing was scheduled for the first week of July. About a week beforehand, I find out I'm pregnant.

I sit until mid-August, get out, move in with coworker/sperm donor. Start intensive outpatient treatment at a local drug and alcohol center as part of my probation. Realize I have a drug problem, and that everything that went south with my boyfriend was my fault. I also very quickly realized that the sperm donor was a fucking psycho mongoloid. I wanted to leave for a good two months before I did - every time he would threaten to use his military connections to put me back in jail, he'd get custody of the baby the moment she was born, etc. After realizing how badly I'd fucked up, boyfriend and I reconnected. He knew I was pregnant. He was happy for me. The first time I saw him again after 5 months, I just laid my head on his chest and cried. And cried. And cried. I was home again. I snuck off to see him for a few whenever I could. November, I leave in the middle of the night and move in with my mother. Boyfriend and I stayed strong, somehow he forgave me for everything I did and was excited to be in my and my daughter's lives. He was there for her birth and was in the hospital with us almost the entire time. I prayed that her biological father would fuck off, and he did. Two months into her life now and I haven't heard a word from him. 

ANYWAY. Sorry for all of that. I smoked 3 times while I was pregnant, regrettably. Since having the baby I've had some wine here and there, but I had the possibility of random drugs tests 3 days/week and didn't like taking the chance. Still, I am a little over 10 months clean from cocaine. I last used May 12th, 2019.

Now, with the virus going on, we've started our group therapy sessions online. My first thought when we started talking about it was that I could smoke again once! I could drink if I wanted to! At the same time this started, I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed adderall. I don't know if it's just the current situation or the adderall as well, but I've been struggling the past two weeks or so. I've had some wine, that doesn't bother me. Yesterday I went over to my boyfriend's for support. I've been terrified of fucking up, using, and going back to jail, or worse, completely relapsing. When I got there, his blood sugar was low. I got him a soda and a snack but frankly, I couldn't deal with it. I went to my friend's, and took 3 hits off the bowl she smoked. And boy, did I fuck up. The entire right side of my face, head, and neck started hurting. I was anxious. Paranoid. Sitting there thinking about how much I had to lose. My freedom. My daughter. All the progress I'd made. I was smoking waaaaay to much weed before I went to jail, and I was able to recognize that recently. I went back to my boyfriend's when I sobered up enough. I'd lashed out at him earlier. I apologized. I cried. He held me and promised I wasn't the gigantic fuck up that I think I am. 

The other times I've smoked recently, I've felt like shit in one way or another and regretted it, resigning myself to not doing it. Then I'd get an itch I couldn't resist and do it again a few months later. But this is different. Now I just want something else. Coke. Crack. Fuck, I have an opiate intolerance and thought about trying heroin. Thought about doing meth again, which I hate. 

I have so much to be thankful for and be present for, but I still want to get away. Why? I was about to start a new job before my state closed everything non-essential down. I hate not working. I hate having nowhere to go, nothing to do. Before I had my daughter I crocheted constantly when I wasn't working, sleeping, or with my boyfriend. Now I feel like I don't have enough time to sit down and really get into anything. I'm trying to find a job, but then I'm risking exposure to the virus and bringing it home to my two month old baby and my 79 year old immune compromised grandmother. If I don't get out and occupy myself, my mental health will suffer and I will self destruct and relapse. If I do get out, I'm risking the health and potentially the lives of two of the most important people in my life. I see a therapist, but they wouldn't let me into the office this week because I have a cough. My best friend and her son have banned all visitors. My mom stays up with the baby overnight since she's able to sleep when the baby sleeps and I'm not. It takes me hours to fall asleep. So instead of trying to, I end up laying in bed on my phone forever, fighting off anxious thoughts until I think I'm tired enough to just pass out, and then I lay here for another hour. 

My boyfriend and I are desperately trying to find an apartment where we can be together. My mother and I do not have a good relationship. Her mental health is and has always been fragile, and I don't want to be here when she flies off the handle again.

I’ve always had friends. Always did decently with women, nothing to brag about or be depressed about. I just don’t know how to meet people clean, and the people I do know don’t interest me all that much. I know that sounds shitty, but it’s the truth.

Being quarantined and out of a job, he’s started taking multiple pills of Xanax and mixing it up with copious amount of alcohol and weed (at least that’s what he tells me he’s taking ). This is the first time I’ve seen him relapse. 
He barely sleeps at night and it’s affecting my sleep schedule. I wake up to find him dosing off standing up, sometimes even on his knees just...falling asleep. It’s awful. His pupils are tiny and sometimes he gets a lazy eye. It’s so scary I’ve gotten nightmares. I’m so stressed, I barely eat. Some days he constantly throws up and all I can do it make sure he hydrates.
I’ve done everything ...Ive talked to him to tell him he has a problem and should seek help. I’ve yelled at him for going back to his old way. I’ve cried to him begging him to stop. Sometimes he agrees he has an addition and will do better. But he doesn’t. Sometimes he outright disagrees with me and gets irritated. I’ve tried being nice/supportive and at the same time... I’ve lost it too.
It’s been a week.
Today, he agrees he needs to stop and told me he needs more Xanax to help him “get off it”. Makes no sense and I know it’s his addiction speaking. 
One step im going to take is not let him use my car anymore...he uses it to get more stuff. But I know it’ll be a fight. This week, I’m going to try not to lose it and be nice. If by week 3 he’s the same, I’m going to push him to go to rehab. It’ll be a battle.

The past two weeks especially I feel like I'm in a constant state of ""it's 9am and I've been awake for over 24 hours and I just ran out of coke"" feeling where I just don't know what to do with myself and nothing matters cause I don't have any more

I lost my job (I was a server at a restaurant). I have been taking suboxone for close to 3-4 years. While it has really helped me, and brought my life back to something that is somewhat normal, I hate needing it everyday, and I feel like it’s holding me back in life in so many ways. 

    I’ve heard about vivitrol, and I think I need to take this time I don’t have to work to stop taking suboxone long enough that they will give me the vivitrol shot. That week is gonna suck, but I think it will help me feel less like I’m still a drug addict, and I’ll be able to apply to jobs that drug test or even join the military (which I have considered often, as a way to go back to school for free and give me structure and a new social group and way of life that will benefit me). 

    I have a criminology degree (I graduated somewhat recently) but I haven’t even tried to apply anywhere in related fields because I still feel like I’m not good enough, and I know that drug tests will be required, and often suboxone is one of the drugs they test for. I also want to go back to school for something different, I feel like criminology was a poor choice I made because I didn’t know what I was doing when I started college at 18. It’s not the degree that I would choose now, and most of the jobs i could get with that degree don’t appeal to me. 

   I just need some support or guidance on how to do this. I don’t have health insurance, but I applied to Medicaid and food stamps since I got laid off, I’ll check tomorrow to see where I’m at with that.

No pneumonia, normal labs, normal oxygen level, so I didn't need to be hospitalized. Honestly I only reached out for help because this sickness was getting in the way of my drinking.

I can't stop thinking about drinking. I hate being sick because it gets in the way of my drinking. I tried to drink a shot from my hidden stash a little over a week ago, but I ended up projectile vomiting it onto the wall. I used a disinfectant with a fragrant to clean it and hide the smell. I lied and told my boyfriend it was water. He doesn't like me drinking, so I hide it from him.


I mainly use alcohol for school. It feels like it's the only thing that helps with my PTSD and stops making me feel hyper-vigilant all the goddamn time. I only drink a shot before class or if I need to work on something school-related. I don't know why, but I'm really productive when I'm on alcohol. I also kind of hate life right now and want to be drunk all the time.


I'm hiding this from everyone, including my boyfriend. He grew up with an absent alcoholic father, so he has some strong opinions regarding alcohol. I technically should be ""seeking help"" but I don't want to. I don't think it's really a problem, and I don't see myself as an alcoholic. It's not like I binge-drink frequently, although I can get pretty drunk when I hang out with friends which is rare these days.


Right now I just want to drink so badly. Just one shot, but I think it will be too obvious. I might have another reaction since I'm sick, and my condition has only gotten worse. I don't want my boyfriend to catch me drinking. I feel like he just doesn't understand. No one does. Not even my therapist. They could never understand.

2020-03-28 14:49:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fqpzec/information_addiction_step_1/,Information Addiction Step 1,"# Step 1: We admitted that we were Powerless over Information; that our lives have become unmanageable.

**Tl;DR:** Stop trying to control Information.

As a hunter on the great plain 100,000 years ago you spot the herd you’ve been tracking for weeks. Your senses heighten—your eyes dilate; your muscles twitch with anticipation of your next move. Every fiber of your being aligns for one singular purpose—a successful kill.

In those hostile and uncertain times you could rely on two things—your body reacting to novel information, and your ability to focus on what this information is telling you.

Maybe in a sea of green you discover a splash of blue. Is that a bushel of berries to be picked and eaten and shared?

Is that rustling of leaves and a cracking of a twig in the pitch black darkness as you rest by the fire a predator poking around and hoping to make you its next meal?

Is the wind blowing in your direction protecting you and masking your scent from your imminent kill?

In this idealized and no doubt romanticized notion of early man’s existence relying on novel information was essential to survival. Ignoring it could be disastrous for you and your tribe. And not acting properly in accordance with what you’ve been taught by the gatekeepers of information—the elders of your people who relay the wisdom gained from perhaps centuries of failure and turmoil and death—help you become more efficient and effective for the group. Not adhering could get you and everyone you know killed.

The ability to focus and the ability to discern—two key tactics in our ability to survive. Period.

It is time to relearn those valuable skills in this day and age in order for us to survive.

What happened to our ability to do this and what can we do about it now?

Before these questions are answered, or rather, explored, we need to take a look at our main adversary of the 21st century—Information.

Information is neutral and cares not of your beliefs, values, opinions, or preferences. Information is all of these things, and much, much more.

What is Information? In a word—EVERYTHING!

The brain does not rest—it is constantly processing, recording, and transmitting Information.

And for most of our history it seems that this was the only technology in the known universe capable of performing these functions to such a high level.

This all changed dramatically with the invention of the computer.

In TK, John Von Neumann wrote his book, *The Brain and the Computer*.

In his book, Von Neumann says a lot of things that I can barely comprehend but that’s ok because this is the first draft and I’m here and we’ll sort it out later.

But the point is, the idea of using the computer as a model to understand our brains was introduced and the way of thinking is as old as computing itself.

This will be explored in more detail later.

Our brains and our bodies—the basic human hardware, has not changed much since it has fully formed around TK thousand years ago.

What has changed—significantly—is the software.

Where our brave and courageous ancestors rarely saw radical or life-altering differences to their environment and technologies—our current state is in perpetual change and flux and overload.

Even so back to 50 years ago when Alvin Toffler, the great futurist and writer, popularized the expression, “information overload” in his book, *Future Shock*.

Information overload was used to describe what future humans ,i.e. us, are going to be dealing with in our current age of information. However, even back then people began to feel the deluge of information of their psyche and the term became popular to describe their era of three television channels beaming information into their brains at home.

How quaint.

And now here we are with three or more streaming services in our pocket, access to all the information we couldn’t consume in a million lifetimes, and a video platform which has around [8 hours of content uploaded](https://www.statista.com/statistics/259477/hours-of-video-uploaded-to-youtube-every-minute/) every second. That’s around 500 hours, or 20 days of content uploaded every minute!

In the time it took to read that last paragraph, about a week's worth of content has just been uploaded. Yikes.

Social media platforms, designed to keep your eyeballs locked in, are working hard to keep your attention on them in a perpetual state of agitation—flight/flight and paralysis from Too Much Information.

“Big Brother isn't watching. He's singing and dancing. He's pulling rabbits out of a hat. Big Brother's busy holding your attention every moment you're awake. He's making sure you're always distracted. He's making sure you're fully absorbed.He's making sure your imagination withers. Until it's as useful as your appendix. He's making sure your attention is always filled.And this being fed, it's worse than being watched. With the world always filling you, no one has to worry about what's in your mind. With everyone's imagination atrophied, no one will ever be a threat to the world.”

More and more apps are developed every day to make you more productive or to help you meditate or focus or to track your screen time.

Is that really the answer you need? More information to combat information?

Is the latest and greatest gizmo or app the right call when you’ve never even developed a coherent and stable structure/philosophy of technology use?

What good is having the best sea-liner in the middle of Wyoming?

What’s the point of owning a snowboard in Fiji?

Why are you trying so hard to control the flow of information, and how is that working out for you?

Do you feel in control? Does your life seem manageable?

How effective are you at doing the work and solving the problems you are uniquely designed to solve?

Although it is useful to understand the flow and history of information, what is most needed now are new maps to navigate the Info-Universe we all inhabit and for most, are being crushed by.

The first step to recovering from an addiction is to admit that you’re powerless over it, and that it is making your life unmanageable.

Trying to control the flow of information—or even worse—trying to keep up with the latest headlines and gadgets and apps and trends—does not work.

If it did, you’d be able to shut off your device right now, step outside, and go for a walk and have no anxiety about what you’re missing out on with the latest tweet, post, or snap.

You could see others in the world and not nervously reach for your device to sooth your nervousness around conversation.

The song you hear at the grocery store could be just that—and not some song you must identify and look up and add on five playlists and share on seven platforms.

[Phantom vibration syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_vibration_syndrome), where you feel your device vibrate in your pocket when it’s not there, would not exist.

Do you still feel in control?

Again, the brain does not rest. So even if you’re physically unplugged from info-beaming screens for a spell—your attention and what you focus on, is still processing information and if you’re agitated by this and are frustrated by your inability to smooth your mind and be present and still then what are we to do?

Is there really a human solution—an app or a hack or your willpower—that can really solve this problem for you?

I haven’t come across one yet, and I think that’s the point.

What one may call God, The Source, Universal Consciousness, Higher Power, Simulation Overlords—whatever—is the overwhelming and awesome information that exists in all realms and planes and dimensions of existence.

Our ancestors understood this—and found great meaning in the stars and their environment and their community.

While the ideal of the individual in recent centuries has proven immensely valuable in helping us recognize the inherent worth of each human with a functioning nervous system to generate potential in either direction—good or bad, heaven or hell, etc.—what these computers have given us is an immense gift to our consciousness—a model of understanding ourselves—our limitations, our vulnerability and frailty, but also, our strength and resilience in dealing with adversity.

It makes about as much sense to me to say, “I am human” as it does to say “I am the Walrus.”

Because at the end of the day, we have NO CLUE what we are and what we are capable of.

Past events and experiences need not dictate future events.

If we can leverage our minds and leverage the vast potential of nearly 8 billion super computers walking around on this planet to get to work solving real problems that need solving for our continued existence and success on this planet and beyond—then who knows what we will be capable of and what we will become.

This is an attempt to create new maps to explore this vast and treacherous territory we are all immersed in.

For the opportunity to reach and inspire and empower others on a global scale has never existed like this before.

But it all starts with you.

So, if you’re ready for more in your life—more meaning and purpose and challenge, you must first surrender to the unfathomable power of Information and learn to become a vessel for its unique code meant for you to discern and focus on.

That all starts with a simple, yet difficult admission—that you are powerless over Information, and that your life has become unmanageable.",1,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9876405596733093}"

Oh addiction. How much I want to say to you. You are a true narcissist. You poke and poke and poke at a persons weakest vulnerabilities until they snap and then you turn and blame them for it. It's textbook. You are the true satan. You promise happiness, power, escape, a break from reality but you don't specify the terms of agreement. You go back on your word and take more than you give. And you have no boundaries. You will continue doing this until death if you need to. But you'd prefer to keep them alive so that they can continue to serve you. So that you have a physical body to occupy, a physical presence on this Earth as the evil that you are. You care only for yourself, you will steal, lie, murder, commit any sin to get even a little of what you want. If you had your way, you'd take an entire life in the blink of an eye for a few hours of altered reality. And you have the perfect cover because it is the person that you occupy who makes these choices. Who does your bidding. To the rest of the world it looks like it is them who is damaged. In a way it is. But it is you who is the real culprit. You come in and change minds - literally. You change brains. Thought patterns. You change what people want. You take away their loved ones, their life savings, their morality, themselves and you have them trade it in for a substance. You don't even care what substance it is, whatever works for that person as long as they give in to you.    


You prey on those who have little or nothing left to lose but you also prey on those who have everything. Just manipulate the ego whichever way it was leaning to push a person out of themselves and into your cold, empty void. You are evil incarnate: you are all the deadly sins and more wrapped up in the most appeasing package for an animal. Pleasure. Short sighted pleasure. Physical, pure happiness and pleasure. What's really sad is that you are also a con man. The happiness you promise is actually that of the person but you concentrate it into a short period of time and take that plus interest from the future. You do not even create your own goodness, you steal that goodness from your host and you rob them of it. You are the mirror that shows each person their own unique darkness and light. Captivating, memorizing, like the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

Before you go thinking too highly of yourself and all of the lives you've claimed, know that you are in fact weak. A parasite. You are a clinging emotion that lives nowhere but in imagination and unmanifest potential. Your only accomplishment is to become manifest with the permission of us, the manifest who operate in this world. You are a predator so you will always find some kind of prey but you are not altogether that hard to defeat. All it takes to defeat you is a simple ""no"". You can't actually force yourself upon someone without their permission. You are a psychological and physical phenomenon brought about only with the permission of others. You are not real and you never will be. The craving for you may feel real but with time it dies back into nothingness. And people do defeat you. They do choose their families and loved ones and jobs and lives over you. With the self you can be combated. Centering in the self and the true nature of reality renders you powerless. Once one comes into themselves, you are seen as the pathetic shriveled thing that you are. Nothing but greed and desire and denial.   


I won't live with you. You've taken enough from me. I won't live with you if you inhabit the form of someone I love, I won't live with you if you try to inhabit me. I will always crush you. I am past your excuses, I am out of patience for your games. I have too much to gain and too much to lose to let you take my time, money, and personality. You went too hard on others and turned me off. So thank you for saving me from you. That probably has to be your biggest weakness. Once your morph into your full and final form you turn all of those around you away from you because you finally reveal the true monster that you are. I know how to deal with you. All I have to do is put my foot down and you will not touch me. I will leave behind every single thing I know in this life and start over before I listen to you ever again. This is one soul you won't destroy. This is one person who will stand up to you. I will stand up to you in all of your forms and varieties. I know what you look like even in your sneakiest moments. I am looking for you and I am bigger than you. You should be afraid of me because I am not afraid of you. I am proof that all you have to do is turn around and chase the chaser and \*poof\* you go up in smoke. I will turn an entire family away from you. I will create a safe haven without you. I will debilitate you and suffocate you. And I'll do it with a smile.

Addiction, get lost. You are dead to me. I have out smarted you. You are done here. With the power of God I am extracted from your grip and given back to myself. You have no power over me, I'm not even a victim of you. You aren't even big enough to victimize me. I will stop at nothing to keep you out of my life and my loved ones (if I can help it).

Am I right to allow this much contact if we are not dating? I don’t want to make things harder for him but I am so scared he’s going to die as I know he’s been doing fentanyl mostly. And I don’t want to abandon him. I’m incredibly close with his family and want to continue to support but I sometimes worry my prescience does more harm as I’ve been his crutch for so long.

I’m 26F. I began dating this guy a few months ago. He told me he had struggled with addiction in the past. Heroin and meth. He made it very clear that he wasn’t using any longer and he was participating in an outpatient type of program , which required going 1-2 a week. Therapy. Uas etc. 

Things were great, we have a lot in common and hit it off pretty rapidly. 

However lately I’ve been starting to see some red flags exhibiting.  Some key examples would be,

• extreme insecurities to the point where he sounds delusional , the stuff he accuses me of or says I’m doing is so far fetched and insane. 

• mood swings , up and down. One minute he’s nice the next he’s very agitated. 

• always defensive when I kindly tell
Him anything he’s doing that isn’t healthy or respectful to me. 

•paranoia about others. Even his own friends and family thinking they are trying to turn me against him. Even though they never say anything remotely like that. 

• inflated ego. But then acts insecure at times. But is also overly confident at times , to the point it comes off delusional sometimes.  He will post on social media lives almost everyday about his life or what he’s doing like he is some celebrity. He even said he has fans and that I’m jealous lol. Even though I’ve never said anything about it. 

• he says every woman wants him. Co workers. Random strangers. He will try to make me jealous saying they all want him and I’m not saying that’s not possible however, I know it’s a lie. 

• he lives with his mother currently and is always broke despite having a decent paying job that is full time. No bills besides his cell. No car payment no rent. And yet he will be broke 4-5 days after getting paid. Which is every two weeks at least 800$. 

I think he is a functioning addict. His niece has told me she thinks he’s using again and ever since then it’s been on my mind. I don’t wanna come off as negative by asking him and him getting offended which I know he will flip and turn it around on me and not admit it if he is. I really care for this man and I don’t know what to do at this point nor do I know the signs of meth use. 

He sleeps every night. I know they say meth keeps you up but idk if that’s a stereotype but he goes to bed at a reasonable time. Is that normal if someone’s using meth or possible? And he eats a lot as well. 
But the other night I slept over and he was twitching ALOT in his sleep. His whole body almost. Like spasms and twitching. 


If anyone has experience with dating a user or ex user can you please tell me if I should be concerned or what signs that aren’t so obvious I can look for. I’m trying to be patient and positive and be supportive even if it’s as a friend. If he’s using I will definitely not pursue a romantic relationship with him any further. I can’t. But I will try to be supportive and there for him if I can be.

In the basement of the Mustard Seed, a red brick building in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood that hosts dozens of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings each week, a handful of people gathered on a recent night to discuss a different addiction.

 

They were members of Marijuana Anonymous, a rapidly expanding 12-step organization that serves those struggling with a drug that is now legal in Illinois and 10 other states, and that many people view as innocuous.

That perception, some meeting attendees said, even extends to fellow drug users.

""When you're in rehab for weed, you don't say you're in rehab for weed,"" said Robb, a 30-year-old who lives in Chicago. ""Half the people will laugh you out of the room.""

But treatment specialists say marijuana's addictive potential is well-established. About 1 in 10 people who use the drug end up with the condition known as cannabis use disorder, meaning they continue to use compulsively even when it messes up their lives.

""It's a lot like the other addictions,"" said Michael Mahoney of Hazelden Betty Ford, a treatment center on Chicago's Near North Side. ""People want to stop using and can't. They have to use in greater quantities to get the same effect or just have a feeling of normalcy. Along the way, problems emerge.""

The Chicago Tribune spoke with people in recovery from marijuana addiction about those problems, the complexities of treatment and the reluctance of others to recognize the seriousness of the habit (as is customary for participants in 12-step programs, they asked to be identified only by their first names or no name at all).  
""Everyone I've told has been dumbfounded that it became an addiction,"" said Shelby, a 36-year-old woman from Chicago. ""It's hard for them to grasp that marijuana is addictive, and also that I used every day for the most part and no one knew. That's how secretive you can be, how good you can get at functioning on weed.""  
Shelby said she started smoking marijuana at 14 — the odds of developing cannabis use disorder are 1 in 6 for people who first indulge when they're younger than 18 — but it didn't really become an obsession until she moved to California as an adult.  
There, she said, the state's liberal medical marijuana law allowed her to buy the drug with little hassle (California has since legalized recreational sales), and THC-infused vape pens let her use discreetly anytime she wanted.

In the last 2 months it has come to light that my brother has been using meth and I assume he has off and on for a while. It has been more apparent because of his behavior/appearance. He has always had a great work ethic and has never not had a job. 

 In a matter of a month of him learning to shoot up, he has had his car stolen, a rental car stolen, bank accounts emptied, lost his job, lost his place to live,  and has gone to jail for possession, and is on the verge of losing his rights to his child.

..who he's with...what he is doing...will I ever see/ hear from him again...how can I HELP him?!

What's hard, is watching what it's doing to my mom/ family. He has been staying with my mom off and on through all of this.  She has been helping him with paying for a different phone, when he needs gas money,  etc.  I feel like a piece of shit telling her to be careful... set boundaries... don't enable him.  Am I out of line/ cold?

When I found out he decided to stop suddenly and man was that a bad idea. After 4 days with no tramadol his therapist told him to start taking again as it's dangerous to quit cold turkey. We decided he should start on 10 tablets a day but he tapered down to 4 within a week and that's when the memory loss started. He woke up from a nap last Sunday 22/03/2020, and he couldn't remember the morning, he was acting drunk like, slurring his words. I thought he'd taken something, was so mad at him, begged him to just be honest but he was adamant he'd not done anything. The next morning, he couldn't remember the day before, we went to the doctor's and he said the amount he reduced to so quickly was life threatening and to go back to 6 a day for at least 2 weeks then drop a pill every 2 weeks.

Its been 4 days and he's still so confused, all day he asks me questions and asks why he's confused it's so scary. His blood test results will come back Friday hopefully, but just wanted to ask if anyone knows about memory loss/brain damage due to tramadol abuse? Can he get his brain function back? Can he have a seizure now or go into a coma?

I know it’s a mild drug if you compare to pretty much everything that’s out there but it’s a relapse anyway, why I think that is because it was the same mechanism as when I did weed, speed and pills, although milder. 

I couldn’t stop myself from being on it 24/7 and I got irritated and anxious when I didn’t get it. I’ve been on this for 3-4 months but it got to a 24/7- point about 2 months ago and I realized my addiction about 3 weeks ago. So yesterday I decided enough was enough and quit cold turkey. 

Have been of for about 48 hours now and I gotta say I’m surprised of how easy it’s been to get through it. My RLS have been off the roof so I’ve had a hard time falling asleep and my anxiety is a bit worse but other than that I’m okay. I can eat and work pretty easily and I know I’m getting through this. 

But it sucks because It feels like I’ve ruined one years work and that I’m back on square one. Therefore I’m asking for some encouragement from you guys, to be honest I feel worthless and it feels like I’m never gonna get away from this. Like my life will be an endless struggle of relapses and quitting, relapses and quitting. Etc, etc.

The Nutty Prof starts by saying he’s back, his previous pc was taped over a month ago BUT the world has changed since.   

He provides a brief background, he’d been a psych prof but left academia, he’s been writing and “relapsed” but 12 step programs hadn’t worked for him so he’d formulated PATAP (discussed in his previous 21 podcasts).   

He tried to formulate alternative terms such as “CLEAR” and “Turning Back Struggler” rather than “clean” and “recovering addict” (non-strugglers were “civilians”).  

He’d hit bottom, managed to go “CLEAR” (minimal cravings) a few months ago (was re-channeling energy —including volunteering to help at a cat shelter).  

His next PC was to apply Campbell’s framework, the “hero/anti-hero” RETURNS to the ordinary world (often from underworld), he was going to use film/literary examples and suggest “RETURN” (recovery) for PATAP.    Coronavirus escalated so he suggests as he returned to the “ordinary world” from the “underworld”, it was “extraordinary” and he thinks “civilians” are now also “strugglers”.  

 In an earlier pc he’d been struggling not to progress beyond NUTTY to CRAZY or even further to PSYCHO, he’s heard people say we live in “CRAZY” times, society is trying not progress beyond that!   

He’d wanted to videotape his next pc about this but he and his producer (former student) are “sheltering in place” so he is now sending his narrative by phone (producer is adding visuals). 

 The former prof says in these pcs, he wants to try to apply psychological-mythological perspectives and also suggest reading material/films for others in “isolation”, his first suggestions are “The Plague” by Camus and “Love in the Time of Cholera” by Marquez.    

He discusses the origin of the words “panic” and “pandemic,” from the Greek God Pan who was the God of the Wild and he also considers the origin of the word “Corona,” he reminds viewers of the Jungian term Persona (“mask” in Greek) and of Jung’s term Shadow. 

He says we can see examples of “shadow” around us but we also see people helping others (bringing groceries to seniors, helping find foster homes for cats stuck in shelters).    He relates an example of a new protocol for a vet visit but says it’s necessary to adjust, that it’s “Better to be Safe than Sorry”.  He ends by wishing everyone to staySAFE.",2,"{'rona': 5, 'virus': 4, 'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 3, 'mask': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978703260421753}"

2020-03-23 12:48:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fnn742/i_disagree_with_the_definition_of_the_addiction/,I disagree with the definition of the 'addiction disorder',"I believe addiction is not a single overarching disorder but much more complex than current medical science and neurology accept.  


for one i dont believe it is a lifetime illness that 'never goes away' either -- i think what 'never goes away' is a sort of mental inclination along with potentially other non-treatable (or poorly treated with modern psychiatric drugs) mental illness that lead to the enduring desire to go back and re-experience or use again.  


however i would say that not only does addiction end with post withdrawal -- that once someone is free of constant urge and withdrawal they are no longer addicted -- but that each individual drug has a unique addiction syndrome and is NOT related to other addictions regardless of the fact that certain reward centers of the brain are held in common.  


this explains why each drug user has a different DOC, why actually one can use their DOC again and quit immediately (though this is not advised and is a risk, it does NOT ALWAYS end in re-addiction and i have proven this personally. its anecdotal, because I AM THE test subject and the test holder, but its true, just unlikely and a serious risk because if you believe that you 'can get away with it' and do it again and again you get yourself back into the cycle.  


this cycle is not created by addiction tho -- its a mental inclination for the reward which endures. the feeling. I would say that each drug you experience this differently, and depending on your state of being mentally, either affects or does not.  


for example i could smoke crack every day for 10 years and suddenly stop, feel better in 3 days and move on like nothing happened. other drugs tho this may not be the case for me.  


this is because my personal set of mental disabilities and struggles lends to the benefit mentally of one specific type of drug over all others -- because it helps. the urge to get help is mainly the drive here.  


so its a set of disorders, multiple disorders, that cannot be treated the same or considered the same. treating people addicted to sex, the same as video games or crack or heroin or PCP is not going to work. each one is unique and characterized by different symptoms and root causes.  


the only success ive had staying off drugs has been outside of AA and NA, denying the supposed definition of addiction and acting alone. Ive done everything they say not to (use drugs to quit drugs in substitution, deny the supposed research, continue use of alcohol on a limited basis etc)  


and im 100% fine. not an alcoholic, not a problem usually. Im one of the 1/1000000 who actually had enough willpower and intelligence, with tons of years of struggling, to actually make it work.  


and even if it is insane odds for a person to make it work. the fact that i have proves something. if im not onto something, then i shouldve failed.  


but im not on maintenance. i dont take anything. i dont go to meetings.  What they say works didnt work at all and what they say couldnt work worked wonders.  


its tough though. ive tried to advise others on my quit method. most of them abuse the quit drugs and never stop getting high. it requires absolute strength of will, high intelligence and great wisdom. you also need godlike willpower.  


if you arent prepared to be tortured in war and not give up information to the enemy, you dont have enough willpower.

For eg: you can have this one behaviour of yours other than drugs or alcohol that you can count on to make everything better if life feels like shit. 
How can you know whether you have an addictive personality? Can someone please share their experiences? 
Also, how can you handle the situation if you do want to experiment with drugs and alcohol but are afraid that you might have an addictive personality and might get hooked to it?

Addictive personalities show obsessive behaviours in friendships and romantic relationship as well. Like substituting a previous addiction with a new lover and then being completely addicted to them and feeling out of control. Does this happen to someone else?

I got addicted to hydros (Norco 5-325) and I was addicted for all of my junior year to them. This lead to me branching out into other pills to get a better high, like soma, Valium and vicadin. I couldn’t afford to buy them off people so I would steal my dads pills that he had from previous surgeries and injuries. I used to make skittle bowls that should’ve killed me. I remember I took the worst mix of my life and nearly OD’d. It’s a very long story but my dad ended up finding out and my mom didn’t yell at me, she sat next to me on the couch and cried because she thought she was a failure because of my addiction. A part of me died that day when I saw my mom cry. That was the day I went clean and vowed to never hurt my mom again, I had even broken my ring finger awfully and didn’t let them prescribe me anything because I was scared shitless of relapsing. Well fast forward to today, I found my moms old hydros and I stole one of my dads soma pills to ‘up’ the effect of it. I took 3 Norco 5-325 and 1 carisoprodol (soma). This was just enough to where my mom wouldn’t notice them gone, and hopefully my dad wouldn’t either. I’m so scared of getting caught I replaced the pills in the pill bottle with the closest looking alike ones that I could. But to whoever is reading this I don’t know what to do, I feel so dirty for what I did. I feel like I stabbed my mother in the back by doing this, and I feel like a absolute failure for destroying the almost 2+ years of sobriety I had achieved. And this addiction is so terrible it makes me feel so empty and hollow and the only thing I can do to get on through the day is get high. There’s this burning lingering in my mind that pushes me to get high, and the I can’t focus or do anything without these pills. Does anyone know what I can do to help myself because I don’t want to hurt anyone I care about by asking them for help, and I can’t reach out to my friends because I don’t want them to know how much of a failure I am. Any help or advice is appreciated.

I was finally able to categorize people based off on their incentives of as to why they do substances. Typically most people will find themselves being a combination of a few of these classifications

***THE 13 SEDUCEMENT INDUCEMENTS***

**Posers:** These superficial people who have no real incentive to fuck with substances besides the fact that they think it makes them look cool or seem more ""hip"" (gives them ""clout""). Usually lightweights...

**Addicts** : Simply no control, no reason besides physical or otherwise psychological dependence on 1 or 2 particular substances. Everyone at some point probably grazed the surface of being an addict or maybe even became an addict.

**Destressers:** Very common incentive. Most people started out as this person. Reality can be quite taxing, these are the people who typically only use substances to unwind and relax

**Herders:** They rely on the usage of substances to fit into a clique/group or seek to be socially fulfilled as they’d rather not be alone, as humans are naturally social creatures.

**Bucketlisters**: The reasoning behind this particular set of individuals doing substances is literally just to say they have done them and it was something to be crossed off the bucket list

**Fiends:** The people who are always on the prowl for their next high, buzz or some change within mental state as long as they are not sober when they don’t have to be, hell, even when they have to be. It's like being an addict....but for practically ANYTHING and EVERYTHING

**Apathetics:** These people need some sort of a constant mentally altered stimulated mind state, not to be confused with fiends who will do everything they can to be under the influence, whereas apathetic just prefer being ""not sober"". They simply do substances because they are bored.

**Enthusiasts:** They simply do it because it’s fun and they enjoy the culture, nothing more, nothing less.

**Inquisitors:** People who do substances in continuous attempts to gain some sort of message of self-awareness knowledge. These are the people who use substances to constantly try to alter or expand their mental state or way of thinking if they are actually able to separate substance induced philosophy from utter nonsense. (NOTE: Being a psychonaut, but psychonauts limited to hallucinogens)

**The Curious:** People who do substances to experience everything they can possibly experience off any kind of substance or combinations of substances that induces change within mental state without tipping over the ledge, often dancing along the lines between being alive and cessation. Often pondering about the substances and experiences they haven't yet come across.

**Dependents:** They rely on substances to get through their necessary activities and sometimes literally just to function. Differs from addicts like how college students RELY on adderall to get through school and assignments, but are addicted to weed(yes there is such a thing).

**Chasers**: Comes from the term ""chasing the dragon"". These are the people who are chasing after the highest or most fucked up they’ve ever been. Always pursuing to get to the same degree of obliterated or even past it without significantly purposefully harming themselves. Just trying to get to that ""10"" again.

**Despairers:** These individuals can't deal with the harshness of reality sober, so they often end up using substances to ""numb"" themselves into oblivion.

 Things are just getting worse. He is being more and more cruel to me.  

I know in my mind that he is trying to make this my fault in his mind. But it hurts.  

He lied to me about three different things today and he refuses to acknowledge it. He claims he didn't lie.  One thing... I walked in the bedroom and smelled that he just had a marijuana vape. I said diverging and he lied and told me no.  It was obvious.  He continued to deny.  A little later, I found the vape pen when I laid down in bed. But he still denied that he lied.  

His smoking is physically hurting me due to my bad allergies.  He confess back in the house and the smoke clings to him and his clothes.  The smoke on his clothing makes my sinuses hurt very badly.  It aggravates my autoimmune.  The result is that I am so exhausted from the pain and my autoimmune being thrown into overdrive by the smoke. 

He refuses to stop.  I told him before we were married that I could not be married to a cigarette smoker or someone who spends over $1,000 a month on weed. He promised me (I know addicts make promises they can't keep) that he wouldn't.  

How do I move on? We have a court date that will be put off due to the quarantine.  I don't know how to tell people. I don't know how to get over the pain of his addiction.  

I wish that I could get through to him. But even though he had told me otherwise over and over, he does not want to overcome the addiction.  I know that it is not just him failing because he says, ""This is just me. You don't accept me for who I am."" I do accept him, but I cannot keep enabling him and bailing him out when he owed his dealer a lot of money (multiple times).  I live him, but I cannot stand by and let him ruin my health and finances not can I stand by and watch him destroy himself.  

I just don't have people who would understand.  I hurt so badly right now.  How should I deal worth him until the divorce guess through?",1,"{'immun': 2, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987699389457703}"

My husband has an addiction to opioids (oxy). He was addicted before he met me. Some weeks ago, he went through hell by withdrawing, it was the most terrible and terrifying thing I have ever seen in my life and I thought my soul shattered into 1000 pieces, seeing him like that. Anyways. It happened now that a couple of weeks ago, he relapsed. He successfully withdrew again and is back on Bup.

Now I have a couple of questions for the ones who have experience with opioids. Since I have never ever done any, I was wondering:  


* What does it feel like when you are on opioids?  
All I observe is just slurred speech, pin-sized pupils, very very slow motor reactions and slow thinking process. But I don't know what the person feels inside. My husband tells me, it feels like ""being wrapped in fluffy cotton"". Is it really, though?
* How does temptation feel like when you are exposed to the drug again? Can you resist? What is it that goes through your mind?
* When you are in idle time, do you think often about the drug? What are the thoughts? 
* If you are on the substitute drug, do you still have the temptation, what is going through your mind? Do you still have a craving? 
* What is there that I can do to help him and build a strong support system, so that he is not tempted to go back?

I have approached my husband and have had many talks about this. It is a very delicate topic and he gave me some insights here and there, but of course not everything, as all this is very deeply rooted to his (mental) past and so on. We are working on it but it's really hard for him to unravel all that and talk about it. Feels like therapy sessions, digging deeper and deeper but I don't want to overstep boundaries, if you guys understand. However, I'm his wife and I want to support him and understand him in the deepest way possible.

Can anyone willing to share with me their experiences?

Many many thanks in advance.

***How childhood sexual trauma influences adult men ...who sleep with men.***

Post topics:
Addiction-Recovery-Trauma - Sexuality 


Hello Reddit world.

This is my first post- After years of confusion- seeking answers- shaming myself - working towards healing - I finally decided to take this to the world to find out where others stand with this. 

Specifically with men(although I know this affects women also)
I know there are men out there that struggle with this exact same thing as me- I am trying to find them- I have met a few along the way.
But there is such a lack of support when it comes to men “like me”.

Here is a quick version:
When I was a child - between the ages 6-9(hard to remember exactly) I was convinced by another boy on the street to engage in sexual behaviour(details not important)- this was a first for me. It opened a world I knew nothing about. However I was intrigued- curious - and above all I trusted this other boy whom was a couple years older.

At some point this switched - what was going on didn’t feel right to me anymore- what was first a rush of positive emotions had quickly turned into something I was ashamed of immensely.

I obsessed over this experience- crying myself to sleep- questioning my sexuality- I had been sexually traumatized and I suppressed this.

Little did I know I would be struggling with the same type of feelings 2 decades later.

In my early 20s I was introduced to mdma - from that moment my life had never been the same.

Drugs changed my life- but I will only comment on how it applies to the childhood sexual trauma.

Typically cocaine or crystal became the main ones for these sexual escapades.

Being under the influence allowed me to tap into a part of me that was - conflicted- confused.
That inner child left questioning between what felt good and what right(or wrong).

I found myself getting trapped in a cycle of using drugs- seeking out same sex encounters- and being filled with shame, guilt and remorse after EVERYTIME I engaged. Not to mention the  crazy fear of thinking I contracted something - specifically HIV 

Sometimes I did it sober- but only because I could NOT stop obsessing - and I felt in order to relieve me of this I’d have the compulsion to act out- again- I hated myself for doing it. The act never lasted long- it was just something I felt I HAD to do.

I identify as straight- I am extremely attracted to females- in all aspects.
When it comes to these men - it is a different type “attraction” if I would even call it that.

So what am I attracted to? The fact that is was taboo? Because it was something different- it was “forbidden”. Maybe I had unfinished business.
A psychologist-  Joe Kort calls it returning to the sexual scene of the crime - childhood sexual trauma does not orient but disorients.

Also Pleasure is pleasure- I feel as though every time I engaged in that behaviour I’d hope that I’d feel differently about the outcome. But it was always negative and in turn I reinforced those feelings I experienced as a child due to the sexual trauma. The ones that told me I am inherently wrong for this. How could I “enjoy” something that was wrong. 

Once I did drugs I was inhibited to do what I wanted without feeling guilty. Again a whole new world was introduced to me and I have been struggling to overcome  this for years.

Truthfully-  I just want to connect with other people who have been struggling with this- to see where they are at in their journey. Maybe they have overcome this. Or on the other hand-  still are acting out but they have a family. Living a double life.

Although I am not with anyone and don’t have a family - I couldn’t help but feel like I lived a double life. So much shame.

I’d like to keep this all inclusive- meaning if there are parts of my story you don’t relate too- but others you do- please focus on that which you do- the similarities not the differences.
All input matters- this is a space to heal.
I’m getting my voice back- owning my story so it looses its power.

Thank you for letting me share.

This is one of the many sayings that we addicts know by heart, but this one has always hit home with me because I know that deep down my addiction soothes me because I am lonely and feel unworthy of the rest of the world.  Whenever I reflect on my acting out behavior I ultimately know that I'm trying to fill a hole in myself that can only be filled by connecting with other humans. My vice isn't important, because no matter if it's drugs or alcohol or sex or gambling or food we are all throwing it into the hole that can only be filled by connecting with others and learning to love who we are unconditionally. 

Over the last few weeks the reality of Coronavirus has hit home.  I've been acting out more, but the disturbing part is that I've been excusing my acting out due to Coronavirus.  The reason I've allowed these excuses to become a part of my life is because I've suddenly been told that I'm no longer to have that which I know can help me.  I cannot connect with my brothers and sisters in meetings.  I cannot connect with my family.  And I am not allowed to find new people to connect with.  As responsible people we have to ""social distance"" so that we can all stay safe.  But ""social distancing"" is just a fancy word for isolate.  And any addict worth their salt knows that isolation is the exact behavior we have to avoid if we are going to stay sober.  It is our road to hell, paved with good intentions.

I don't have an answer for this.  I just want all the other addicts out there who are suffering under these conditions to know that I'm thinking of you and that you don't suffer alone.  We have the tools to make it through this, and we will come out stronger in our sobriety.  Our addiction does not own us, and it will not make this any easier.  Please be safe and stay strong and lets all make it out the other side.  I don't know you, but if you understand what I'm taking about and can relate I love you.

Best of luck to you all and please take care of each other.",58,"{'rona': 3, 'virus': 3, 'distancing': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8887614011764526}"

Recently I’ve been craving them again, but without a prescription I can’t get any. Instead I substitute my “craving” by taking random over the counter pills. Tylenol, Advil, sleeping aids, etc. Unlike my anxiety medication these are way easier/cheaper to get. I usually double or on rare occasions triple the dose. 

I don’t know why I do it as they dont make me feel high. Sometimes they just give me a stomachache and headache. I’ve also been tempted to mix the pills with cough syrup, but I haven’t gotten to that point yet. Has anyone else had this issue before?

He's got anxiety and I think he tries to self medicate with substances, but addiction takes hold of him. 

Some backstory:  The addiction didnt start until a few months after our marriage and now we're 3 years in. Went from opiates to heroine to rehab to kratom. He hid his addiction for almost a year before rehab, then hid the kratom. And lied twice about stopping. The kratom is legal, yes,  but hes abusing it and I believe it caused a seizure that fractured his shoulder among other health problems. We tapered him off because he wanted to get clean, now I find another bag again that he lied about until I found it... (a common theme with him is to deny EVERYTHING when I bring up concerns, until I find proof and even then hes reluctant) He says he just got too anxious one day and needed ""an out"" and hereeeeee hasn't found an outlet for his anxiety yet that isn't substances. At least not one he likes as much. 

BUT when things are good, they're great... but eventually he starts using in secret again. Eventually I find out somehow, after usually weeks of paranoia and anxiety on my part. I feel paranoid and anxious and when I tell him this, he reassures me every way he knows how... (it's starting to not work as much anymore and I'll still feel at least a little crazy) Sometimes I can push it to the side and we have great days still, but then I find proof hes using and I feel hurt and betrayed that he lied to my face again. I tell him I don't trust him, and my anxiety disorder had this running through my had that may or may not be true, like if he's gone to the gas station too long, is he using? What did he spend $X on st the gas station, gas or kratom? So yea technically ""it's one lie, only about this"" but it permeates and irres affecting my mental health and our relationship because he KEEPS DOING IT. 

Does this cycle go on forever? Because I'm questioning my marriage. Does the good outweigh the bad? Is the sheer amount of love I have for him worth the crisis mode i fall into when I find proof of his lies? We've gone through this same cycle at least 3 times and I'm TIRED. It's to the point now where we were in this EXACT situation 4 months ago, and I don't feel like talking about it, because I feel like we JUST DID. He says hes not perfect and he makes mistakes, but the same ones?Will he ever learn to stop lying, and at least trust me and tell me the truth? Are there any success stories?

Hey there! 
I’d love to get your feedback on my situation. 

First, let me give you a little bit of a backroad about us: 
Gay couple. Married. We’ve been together for about 6 years. We’re  in an open relationship and it works well for us.

Situation: 
I found out that my husband is down to parTy(pnp, smoking crystal meth and then have sex).
I saw it when he was chatting with one of the guys on one of the dating apps. 

IMPORTANT: I asked him before seeing it if he tried T(crystal meth) or not. He said no, and he said he would never do it. 

Then I saw that he said definitely yes to pnp in one of the conversations on the app. 

We talked. He said, that yes he tried it one time only with one of his fuck buddies and he did not like it. 

My hubby has an additive personality. He likes to drink but it’s under control, he knows when it goes out of control and takes a step back and gets back to normal. He does smoke a lot of weed, but it doesn’t affect him in a negative way. 

I feel like he might be lying to me about that one and only time, as well as that he doesn’t like it. Why?  Because if I tried something and I don’t like it, I wouldn’t do it again, right? But in his conversation he was quite down to parTy and he sounded a bit exited about it. Granted the guy who texted him wanted to get fucked up and have sex. My hubby said “hellz yes!” I think it’s a clear indication of excitement lol. 

We talked. He blocked that guy who he partied with. He blocked the guy who asked him to parTy with him. 
He said that he doesn’t wanna see other guy except a couple of fuck buddies who according to him do not do drugs. 

He also mentioned that he part took in using heroine with one of his friends. But it’s only one time thing and he doesn’t like it (I kinda believe it, his friend ODied on heroine long time ago and after that he wouldn’t do it)

He doesn’t wanna use dating apps anyone because of what happened. He said that he wouldn’t use crystal meth again. 


What should I do in this situation? I don’t see changes in his behavior. In fact until our conversation, our relationship actually was getting better.

I’m afraid that he might be on a slow track of becoming addicted to T. 
I’m ok with light drugs. They won’t kill you, it’s easier to get off them. 
I’m worried that he might get off truck with crystal meth and then it will be a huge problem. 

What should I do? Now, I’m having trust issues with him. He does lie quite a bit. It’s just his personality, he’s a bullshiter! Nothing terribly huge until here recently. 
Should I stay with him? I do love him and we get along very well. We always sort things out. But I’m afraid if he goes get addicted to meth, it will be over for us.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.991280734539032}"

I cant give the full story because its too long but at the moment im heavily addicted to fentanyl, weed, alcohol and was cocaine as well, and ketamine.

Its been 8 full days since I had any cocaine, and its safe to say it has been the cause of me loosing 2 girlfriends and 3 jobs. In the last 8 days I have been feeling such depression its unreal. It must be because I was cheating life by using cocaine, then weed, then alcohol then fentanyl all at once to keep myself happy, and now as they are going away my brain is going so haywire its unreal. For the first time I feel so depressed and pointless that I actually really want to die, and this is coming from someone who has self harmed for years and purposefully OD'd to try kill themselves about 7 + times.

I quit my job because I could tell that if I continued the path I was on, being addicted to those 4 substances, I was going to die soon, and the choice was made while I was super high on everything. It was a very quick decision I made which was strongly influenced by me having a large supply and a strong desire to stay home getting high, it was almost like I made the choice for the wrong reasons but there was a right reason hidden there to justify it, and now im dealing with those consequences.

At this point, I cant even get out of bed without drinking, and taking fentanyl. Without that im shivering in bed wanting to die, - and I do not mean alcohol withdrawls - I know what they are and I havent been getting them - I mean shivering like feeling shakey and unsettled because I have no purpose in life, its an emoitional feeling...the depression and sadness I feel is beyond anything Ive ever imagined was possible. Now even with drinking, and weed and fentanyl, im barely finding the enthusiasm to leave my bed, and its reaching a point where I officially have no weed left at all, and am only going to be able to continue drinking for another day or so. I am also not going to be able to get fentanyl anymore which is something I only started a few months ago but I feel is having a strong impact on my state of mind.

I am so tempted to sell my computer, which is my only source of entertainment, so that I can fund these addictions until I get a benefit payment. I havee no rreason to leave the bed and no happiness at all without these and i feel like dying, surely it makes sense to keep funding them?

Its been 8 days without cocaine, and its been the most depressing horrrible time of my life, if I now have to stop alcohol, and weed, and fentanyl ontop of cocaine, all within a few days, how am i going to cope with that?

I have actually strongly been considering selling it and bbuying a large chunk of weed, alcohol and then crystal meth. I have never tried it but I know that it will make me happy and keep me happy for hours at a time. Its a stupid idiotic idea because I know that if cocaine withdrawl has been this bad, meth will be much worse, but I just want to be happy again. I want to have enthusiasm again and enjoy things. Or even if I dont get meth, then i can use the money to buy enough weed and alcohol to keep them going until my benefit payment or until I can find a new job, and I can get MDMA to subsitute the fentnyl

Since I stopped cocaine the only thing getting me out of bed is these other addictions, if I cant have them anymore I really think I might kill myself. its hard to describe how depressed and horrible it feels to be with nothing",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992464780807495}"

I am still barely managing to support my alcohol addiction and last night I officially ran out of weed aswell. I have been drinking 10-30 units per day for 4 years and smoking 10+ spliffs per day for over 10 years. More recently, in the past 4 months , I was also stupid enough to add a Fentanyl addiction to the mix, and I really do regret that.
I woke up at 1am today and I have this sheer pointless feeling to living, I feel like shivera and Shakey but I'm not cold or anything, it's like pure anxiety. During my cocaine relalse I lost a 3rd job and a 2md girlfriend, so that may be contributing to why, but I have this horrible severe feeling of death lately. I am suspicious that it's mostly due to the fentanyl aswell, or it's just being put off/ delayed by the fentanyl. For the last week where I have been waking up with this feeling of death, the only thing that has curbed it has been using fentanyl, weed and alcohol, and even with all 3 I am still getting the feeling.
Has anyone ever been this low? Tomorrow I will have completely run out of weed, in a few days alcohol and fentanyl aswell, and even with atleast one of these I feel like killing myself? 
Have i messed with my brain reward system so much that I am destined to feel ultra depressed until my brain readjusts?

2020-03-18 18:48:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fkyxd4/partner_of_an_addict/,Partner of an addict.,"I am a 26F, my partner is a 29M. We've been together over 4 years. He is a recovering addict, which I was aware of going into the relationship way back when. He had been clean from heroine for at least a year. Earlier in our relationship, we both had our fun, which I'll admit wasn't the best idea. Mainly drinking and occasionally other things. I've dealt with my own substance issues in the past, but the difference between him and I is I decided to stop part taking in such behavior a long time ago, which was enough for me to be done. For him, that is not the case. I guess some part of me will never fully understand, no matter how hard I try.

He relapsed with his drug of choice (heroin) a couple of years back. Long story short, it was absolute hell for everyone involved. A part of me thought it would never end. In a way, it hasn't. He's found other substances to depend on after he got out of inpatient (2nd time in his life). When some progress has been made, he'll find something to distract his brain. 

A little background on him. He's a very kind, soft-hearted individual, incredibly sensitive. I know that takes part in his addiction. As far as he's mentioned, his past trauma's consist of his father being physically disciplinary with him and his brother growing up. He'll still defend his father regarding that matter, but I believe that is a part of the problem as well. In addition, his father is not the best remodel. When they hang out and get shitfaced together most of the time. A great example of being a product of your environment. His mother is more like me, a ""normie"" I suppose. His parents divorced about a year ago, and his mother has since remarried. There could be something there as well. I know he took the divorce kind of hard when it was occurring. 

My major goal is to get him to talk to someone. He tells me constantly that he wants to be clean, but hasn't done the steps to do it. I tried to be the condo-wit for him, but I doesn't work. I'm biased, and at this point, very hurt, betrayed, helpless, and cannot trust him at all. We've been here before, and I understand recovery is a life-long journey, but he needs help finding the motivation. He needs to talk to people who really understand what he's going through. Sadly, I'm not equipped to do it anymore. I love him, and all this breaks my heart. Honestly, I would leave if I believed it was possible, but with how the world is (I'm in the US) and being out of work because of the virus, it's just not in the cards for me right now. If anyone has any kind of advice for myself, or him, I appreciate it.

Along the way I made some guidelines to keep me on the path. If they help anyone else then maybe I can save them years of trying to figure some of this out. If not and these are already obvious then you are smarter than me.



1. You have to want to quit.

All the self-help books and all the support groups in the world are not going to help you if you don’t actually want to quit.

2. Find a reason to quit.

Any reason outside of yourself that can make you accountable. Start small and build from there.

3. Redirect the the urge to something good. 

As an addict I have the superhuman ability to pour all of myself into something that gives me joy. Replacing the bad behaviors with something beneficial can help help while keeping you busy.

4. Never get bored.

I’m a machine of habit when I get bored I get back into whatever habit that’s easiest for me. 

5. If needed remove the people and things that allow you to continue the addiction. 

This one sucks. It hurts to lose someone that was close to you but when the people around you aren’t helping you then you need to think about what you really need to do and sometimes that means cutting people out. This goes for inanimate objects as well.

6. Find anything that works for you.

What works for you may not help someone else. What works for me might seem alien and totally unreasonable to somebody else but as long as it keeps me clean then that’s what I need to do.


7. Get help if you need it.

You don’t have to do this alone. If you feel yourself falter or begin to fail there are thousands of people that know how to help and might even know exactly what you are going through.


You are all awesome.

You can do this.

Never stop.

He'd come to family events high and unable to have a real conversation with anyone. It hurt me. He had been my best friend when we were growing up. 

A few years ago, I started working with families of addicts, as well as addicts themselves. It was an eye opening experience. 

I learned that there are so many families like mine. I learned that my brother wasn't simply searching for his next high, he was searching for a way to numb his pain--pain he'd endured as a teen and often at the hands of my father.

Had my first drink at 19, was addicted and a binge drinker at 20, was a daily drinker by 21 or 22 then got to where I went back and fourth between binge drinking and daily drinking. I tried to quit a few times, and kept trying to moderate, it of course didn’t work. 


 Drugs got mixed in at around 22 , use was sporadic due to lack of access. It started with finding my leftover Focalin, I snorted that 8 days in a row. I kept telling myself I’d stop, but couldn’t. I stayed in that same pattern where i’d go months without drugs then use consecutively until I ran out. 




In January I decided to quit for good. I had a gut feeling that it had to be then. I started going to AA, I made it 24 days before I relapsed. Made it 8 days, did adderall. Made it 3 days then drank. Made it 7 days then drank. Made it 21 days then drank and did adderall at the same time. Things have gotten harder each relapse. Every time I care less ablust staying sober, I care less about my life, I care less about consequences, I care less about the people around me. And every time I get bolder, I push my limits more, I get willing to do more things. Like, I’m probbaly going to pick up meth soon. 


I’m miserable. I just want to die all the time now, death seems easier than getting sober. I don’t know how the descent happened this fast. I’m so close to dropping AA and just going back out.

Thankfully this process is complicated and lengthy enough to make it less appealing as an addict who wants immediate cash for their habit. I’m so thankful they don’t make it easier because this money is seriously helping me get back on my feet.

I started getting my life together and hadn’t filed my taxes in 6 years. I just filed for 2015/2016 and I got close to 8k back today! I’m using this money to pay off tickets / debt and help start my small business. This can be a very well timed boost for people in recovery. It’s seems like a daunting task when you’re constantly on something but when you’re straight, it’s not all that bad.

Step One: If you’re like me and havent filed for many years you may have to get physical copies of your T4 and provincial tax forms. Easiest way to do this is just to go in person and ask for the copies. I looked up Revenue Quebec and took the bus/metro to their offices in downtown Montreal. They were very pleasant and I was in and out in under an hour. The copies of my Relève 1s arrived 10 days later.

While I was there they gave me some dollar amounts that the Canadian government could use to identify me over the phone (amounts that would show in can govs records)

I also asked them to print my last two notice of assessment forms from the last two years I filed. For me it was 2013 and 2014.

Step 2: Call the Canadian government and use the information you now have on hand along with your address and SIN to identify yourself. They may have an address you’ve forgotten about so go through all your past addresses and write them in notes on your phone. Once they have successfully identified you they will send you the necessary forms. 

Step 3: Wait 10 business days for your tax forms to arrive. Once you have them head over to H&R block. Believe me filing paper taxes is complicated and you’re better off paying them the $100 bucks so you don’t have to do it yourself. They will ask you questions such as “we’re you single that year” and “did you live alone”.

These questions relate to tax credits you get from the government. If you had a girlfriend living with you for 2 weeks don’t mention it. If you lived with her or him for 5 years it’s better to be honest as you are common law at that point. 

Once the hour long appointment is over they will tell you how much you’re getting back and for 20 bucks they will take their fee out of the return so you don’t even need to pay on the spot. 


I had to figure this all out myself and it wasn’t easy. Let me know if you find this useful or have questions.

I have been trying hard to fight the temptation.,"I am not 100% sure what my situation is: whether it is an addiction or sexual urges that return all the time and now that my brain has discovered the idea of sex workers; it keeps wanting to satisfy them this way. I had been a 25 year old virgin with no prior sexual history whatsoever and had never been intimate with a female in any way whatsoever. 7 months ago, I thought about the idea of seeing a sex worker and wanted badly to know what sex was like. But, I abandoned the idea and had to fight it for 5 months until it finally happened because I couldn't fight it anymore. Last January, I went to a massage parlour and lost my virginity to a masseuse. I went the next day and had sex with another masseuse. I vowed never to do it again. That being said, a while later the urges to do this again kept returning (the brain perhaps needing another fix and having discovered this new interesting stimulation). I fought hard to suppress them. I relapsed 3 weeks ago when I booked an escort for an outcall to my place. But, she ended up canceling saying she was sick. She emailed me the next day apologizing for what happened and asking if I want to see her that night. I told myself you had been given a chance not to relapse when she canceled so I prevailed upon myself not to go forwards with the rescheduling (it took a lot of guts and it was super super hard to compel myself to not go ahead with it; sex was just a few keyboard letters away and I had spent the day prior cleaning my place so my place was ready for an encounter). The urge was super strong but I later found comfort in the fact that I was able to exercise self-control in this respect. Fast forwards to a few days ago, again the urges returned. I had the urge hire a sex worker. It was so hard to fight it yet again and still is to a certain degree (but I reminded myself of the possibility of getting in trouble with the law) and this has been a strong enough bulwark to prevent me as getting arrested for something like this would be the worst fate ever, one worse than death to me (In Canada, it is legal to sell sex but illegal to buy sex which is a weird kind of law). Generally police here don't enforce it but you never know and I felt like I shouldn't take the risk as I am petrified of the possibility itself no matter how low. I risked it twice and feel I should not risk it a third time.

Anyhow, I found some other activities to do today instead of going to that place or booking an escort. Currently reading a book for instance.

However, I do not know if this is enough to prevent. To satisfy my urges, I masturbate to porn everyday. Sometimes it works because my libido decreases after it but sometimes I feel the imagery drives my thoughts to other routes. The imagery makes me want to experience it in real life which coupled with the fact my brain now discovered it may fuel it further.

When I was considering hiring an escort for a third time, I was thinking ok maybe if you do it a third time, you could then try to never do it again. I saw some of the photos (perhaps I should not have been checking these websites out) and I was like: ""I missed out on this possibility. I could try a different girl with a different body type and get more experience etc)"". Yet I realize If I am to do that, a while later, I will be back in the same boat and will be facing my urges again. Sex will basically never be enough and my mind will keep turning to other girls with different body types and try to compel me to try seeing/booking them too just to try different encounters. So, I thought to myself it makes no sense to do it a third time if I want to stop going down this path altogether. Why lose a further $300-400 if I will likely be in the same boat again a few days later or even a few months later? And, I cannot do it anyhow because of the possibility of risking arrest which to me would be the end of everything. This brings us back to the first statement in this message, perhaps it is not an addiction yet but it can become one if I do it a third time for instance. If it won't turn into an addiction, at least I it will probably turn into a habit which is also not good because I will lose lots of money.

Being a single 25 year old who has never been in a relationship and who is so alone and has a few friends complicates things further. As I said, I have always lacked intimacy and some days I have nothing planned and feel so alone which compels my thoughts to go down temptation further. My coworkers appear quite anti-social and not even interested in making friends. When I go to events, I end up briefly chatting to strangers and that's about how it goes. At events, people tend to have their own group of friends or are with their SO to want to meet new people. I have never been in a relationship. I also have low self-esteem. I cry myself to sleep sometimes because of my solitude. All of these things fuel my temptation and urges to see a sex worker.

&#x200B;

My name is Devan. I started using when I was only 15, it all started with my wisdom teeth. Something completely innocent, right? Well, what I didn't know but would soon find out, they prescribed painkillers for certain procedures. They gave me Vicoden after my surgery. I had a pretty rough child hood, diagnosed with Diabetes Type 1 at the age of 10, dealt with a lot of depression issues from my diabetes and hormones being all sorts of out of wack. Unfortunately, I enjoyed Vicoden. My grandma (Not a day goes by I don't regret this) used to be prescribed Oxy. After my Vicoden prescription was out, I began sneaking Oxy's. The first time it was very intense. I ended up being so tired I passed out and woke up the next day for school, not realizing how dangerous what I had done truly was. Fast forward to age eighteen, my first love got me into smoking weed. This was during the rush of the fake Marijuana usage, K2, JWH-18 etc. We began smoking K2. I had a friend that seized in front of me, and had to be put in a medically induced coma over it. Oddly enough, you would think that would have been enough to stop me. It only stopped the substance I was using. ""A drug, is a drug, is a drug"". From there, it only got worse. At 21, I had become an alcoholic within a year. 5ths every night, 30 racks, whatever I could get. This lasted for a long time, until about age 23, when I met my current wife. I had quit drinking! I finally did it, and I was sober for some time. From everything this time. I thought that I had finally made it out. So, I thought. My wife and I went through a really hard time in our relationship, which caused us to separate. Over those few months, 2016-2017 we were separated, I began experimenting with harder substances. It started with Cocaine at a rock concert, from people I thought were my friend. They told me to just try it one time, if I didn't like it they wouldn't push me again. Who would have thought they would never have to push me again, because I would ask for it. Cocaine is very expensive, and harmful. One day, my buddy said he had a great deal from a guy he knew. So, we went and got the drop. I knew immediately after using, that it was not what I had thought it was. What we had been given was Shake and Bake, extremely dangerous, thermogenic amphetamines. ONE single use, transformed me into a full blown addict. For months, I slept from place to place, watched my ""friends"" kill themselves over this substance. Finally, I had a moment of clarity. Sitting there staring at a dub, asking myself, ""What the F\*ck are you doing to yourself?"". My dealer, who took me in when I was homeless, sat me down and he talked with me. He told me that I am a good kid, I have no charges, I'm smart, and in good conscious he couldn't keep feeding my addiction. He wanted me to get clean. This was following my moment of clarity, by only a few hours. So I did, I called the only person I knew who could help me. I called my wife and told her what was going on, I was so desperate to get clean.   


On my final comedown, I had been up for 5 days straight. I was hallucinating, desperate for it to end. My wife took me in, I slept for 3 days. Only waking up to use the restroom, eat 3 bowls of cereal just to throw it all back up (Graphic, I'm sorry, but this is important). My sober date is January 13th, 2017. I have not touched a single substance, no drugs or alcohol period. I started homeless and hopeless. I now am an Communications Engineer, I have two children, a house, cars, anything we could ever dream. This woman put aside everything for me, nursed me back to health, and stayed by my side while I recovered. As for my dealer, he did something for me that saved my life, literally. Not only did he stop providing my habits, but he was a Confidential Informant. ""Operation Freefall"" locked up the majority of people that used to use with me. He gave me a second chance at life, a chance to build a future, with my freedom and record intact. My wife, gave me a second chance at love, and showed me that there are things that drugs could never give me. She gave me hope, she gave me two beautiful children. In a beautiful symphony, I had been blessed and rehabilitated. All the pieces fell into a perfect picture, creating the man I am today.

&#x200B;

Now, as the title states, ""How did this affect how I live my life today?"". I am a musician, an engineer, a father, a husband, a brother, a son, and at the end of the day, a man (at least now). I went through some unimaginable hard times. All addicts have a story, and this is mine. A girl I used to use with never quit. She unfortunately had to have 2 valves on her heart replaced from an infection, and she tragically passed away December 23rd. I walked through the fires of hell, and gratefully, I made it out. Now, I spend my time trying to pull others out the same way that these people in my life did. I spread awareness, hope, and love. I work closely with people going through recovery, I write to those in rehab (Pen Pals) as well as a clothing like called DreamXL who the owner is an ex addict as well. We work hand in hand to change lives. He does it through speaking, his business and story. I change lives through my story, but also through music, by sharing the darkest parts of addiction with those who might not understand it.   


I can never change the things that I've done, the people I've hurt, and those that I've lost. But I can learn from them, and help mend others who might need that same hand that reached for me to pull me out of the flames. 

 ""God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,  
Courage to change the things I can,  
And wisdom to know the difference. ""

I know I'm not the only person with this addiction as I've watched stores go from stocking small amounts to huge amounts of whippits as us addicts feed them our coin. I've seen other people buying huge bulk amounts that aren't for ""casual use."" I remember doing my first whippit at a psych party at least 8 years ago. I just did one and it flipped my world upside down for 30 seconds and I loved it.

I started doing them on my own by myself not too long after. First it was just a box or two at a time. But now I can go on multi-hour binges where I huff down 600 of the things in a day. When I'm done, there's whippits all over my room or car (if I'm hiding out from my roommates) and I shamefully find a dumpster to take them to and hope no one sees me dumping all those little clinky canisters. Sometimes I can still hear one I missed rolling around under my car seat. I have a pounding headache and for some reason these things make me lose weight (dehydration?).

I had a really bad weekend and huffed on Sunday, then had to leave work early on Monday to go huff, and then took a sick day Tuesday to do more. Spent yesterday resting and now I'm back at work and my feet are on FIRE. Long term use of nitrous causes neuropathy through b12 deficiency. I've been addicted to these things for 8 fucking years and never gone more than a couple months without them. But I binge so hard now, it messes up my sinuses (feels like I have bubbles in my ears) and causes this horrible neuropathy. It cuts me off socially and takes me a couple days after a binge to reintegrate into society.

This stuff is pure evil. It was such a wonderful interesting trip the first while that I was using them, but now my life is living hell. I want to quit, I've wanted to quit for years. But as soon as the fire stops in my feet, and the pain and anxiety of life ramps up again, as it always does, I will just want to escape into hours of huffing nos. It's ruined so many relationships because I say or do stupid shit while high. I just want it to stop, I want a normal life.",28,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982097148895264}"

to sleep in days and idk where to start with asking for help. About 5 years ago, I promised the sweetest man that we could be together eventually when he got clean. I asked him to get help before meeting bc I had my own issues that won’t mix well with that. He was a meth and heroin addict. I think mostly Heroin. My dad is a meth addict and I’ve never been around it personally. I’m a recovering alcoholic, but pretty clueless when it comes to these other demons. He went to a Christian Men’s home for a few years and seemed to be doing amazing. He moved in with his parents two years ago and they were so happy when I moved out of state to come be with him. He was out of the men’s home for a year, got promoted to a manager position at his job right before I moved here. I was proud of him and how proud of himself that he was. He was doing great compared to his past. I’ve never been with an addict before and didn’t realize how quickly those demons sneak up and how manipulative they become. When I moved here, we both agreed on smoking weed and that being the most we do. But it slowly moved to roxys. He works his ass off and told me he’s in pain and just needs to relax after work. Long story short, now he’s taking a lot of subutex and Xanax now. We’re living with a roommate who sells them now. I didn’t know he did in the beginning. They work together and i know he cares about us. He says we’re like his son and daughter now. So tonight I found my boyfriend passed out crumpled in our small bathroom floor. I knew deep down I was gonna find him like that before I opened the door. I was freaking out, but he was def alive. It took me about ten minutes to get him out of the bathroom and back to the room. I hid all the pills and key to get out of our room bc I’m scared of what he’ll try if he wakes up again. He was talking crazy about his grandpa dying and them telling him he had to
Read a certain chapter in the Bible. I finally got him to lay down. I took a picture of him how I found him in the bathroom so I can confront this tomorrow. Idk if I should show our roommate and tell him he can keep selling him these subs. Or will that be betraying him? The last thing he wants is his mom finding out, but I don’t want to lose him bc I’m not making the right choice to help him. Idk why I’m posting on here. I guess if anyone has advice on what I should say to him tomorrow. He mentioned yesterday that he wanted to be done with the subs. The Xanax just started like a week ago and helps him sleep. He’s always nodding out and burning holes in my bed. I just cry and beg him to stop. I think I made a mistake moving here bc I got him away from his Christian healing that was saving his life. I feel like I got him away from his family bc of my own social anxiety issues and demons I’m battling right now. When I picked him up off the floor, it reminded me of elderly residents I used to take care of in nursing homes. Skin and bones. I’m really scared. I got him to bed and asleep finally. I don’t want any advice if it’s to give up on helping bc he doesn’t give up on me when I’m having a mental health crisis. He’s an angel who helps everyone he can. This hurts so bad idk if I’m even making sense.

This week he almost died, decided to get sober, and I haven't been able to process it yet. 

First off, sorry for the LONG ASS post.  But this has been weighing on me and it just came out like a load of verbal vomit. 

The last two weeks have been pretty monumentally hell-ish for me, and truly, I just want to stop doing everything and sleep for the next month. Back Story: I have BPD. My brother has been relatively recently diagnosed with Bi-Polar. He's also an alcoholic. He's two years older than me and was always the 'bad kid' growing up. This honestly fed into my BPD because all I wanted to do was be perfect so our parents would notice me and give me the love and attention I desired. Unfortunately, they were too busy disciplining him and (as I've learned this week) convincing him to keep secrets from me for the past 20 years. The parents didn't want me to be conflicted or make the same choices he was making so they kept everything a secret. This includes their discretions as well as his.  

Now my brother and I weren't really close, but we had a lot of overlap when it came to our friends so we would end up at similar hang outs on the weekends. I knew he drank. I knew he smoked. I knew he got high. I'd be blind not to. I just didn't know EVERYTHING. 

Throughout the years, I've seen him make poor decisions for himself, but I would let him do it, because I wanted him to know he could trust me when he felt he couldn't trust our parents. He would wreck cars and I knew he was probably drinking, but he would tell our parents that it was some other reason. He's also gotten a couple of DUIs which caused him to also lose his license for quite some time. 

Fast forward to about 4 years ago, he really starting to seem like he was getting his life on the right track. He was a proud father, had a job he'd been working to get for years, and in a happy relationship. He also got his license back. But then he starting stealing our vehicles. He would go out after we all went to bed and take our keys and go out and try to come back before we woke up. We even found him in the back of a sex shop one time. It then started to escalate. He totaled my parents' car. He was only about two blocks from our house when he drunkenly hit a parked car. Our neighbor, who is a local police officer, came out and arrested him as he was trying to leave a note on the car apologizing. 

He served a week in jail, had to take a anti-drinking seminar, and lost his license again. He then began going to AA. This didn't really work out for him, because he's a conflicted atheist (in the sense that he not only doesn't believe in a God. He doesn't believe in anything. So some steps seem implausible for him.) 

He was good for a few months, got a new job, got on medication. Then something would trigger him and he would start stealing our cars again . \*\*Please note that we did hide our car keys at night. Mine were on my night stand and my parents were in their room on the dresser.\*\* We also learned this week that in addition to drinking again, he also started using meth ‘recreationally’. 

The next accident happened the following winter when I woke up to find that my car was parked in the street, missing its bumper, and my parents' (now new) car was missing. He came home and claimed that he just pulled it out into the street and didn't take it anywhere. It must have been a hit-and-run, except that the damage was facing the curb, NOT the street. I was livid and, obviously, made him pay the deductible to have my car fixed. Even if his BS story was true, if he wouldn't have moved it, it wouldn't have gotten 'hit'. 

Same cycle happened again and again, with a growing number of wrecked cars. Each time he seemed to hit his lowest low and promise to change but never did. It mostly happened if we forgot to take our keys with us at night. It was as if it was permission to him to take them. 

It all came to a head two weeks ago. He snuck into my parents’ room and took their keys from the dresser. He took the car out. And got drunk. And got high. And got into an accident. But this time, he fled the scene. The car was totaled again. Unfortunately for my parents, the insurance was not covering anything, because they made my dad sign a document stating that my brother was explicitly excluded from coverage and they wouldn’t have to pay if he got into an accident and wrecked it. Even if my parents reported it stolen. 

My brother was missing for four days until we get a call from him – in the hospital. He was bitten by a dog and the bite got infected. The first day I went to visit him in the hospital, I yelled at him. I was so mad at what idiotic decisions he had been making, and that he felt he couldn’t come to me. I would always tell him that he could come to me. I felt betrayed. My parents stayed quiet as they were still in shock from the week’s events. My brother finally started being honest with us and with himself. He admitted to all the lying and drugs that he’s been using. He admitted that it was finally time he got professional help, and I’m (skeptically) hopeful that he means it. 

While in the hospital, we cleaned out his room of all the contraband and triggers that we found and from places he told us. It was refreshing that he was finally sober and wanting to be.

The hardest part is that he’s all sunshine and rainbows and optimism now. My parents still look like their broken – like they failed. They knew that I’ve been dealing with a lot of abandonment issues due to my Borderline, but they never thought that it had gotten to this point with my brother. 

I’ve been doing my best to be the rock and hold down the fort, but I keep telling them to go to therapy. That they need to find a healthy unbiased outlet that will give them tools to help work through these emotions and deal with them in the right way. They won’t, or at least my dad keeps deflecting, while my mom just says nothing and tries not to cry. 

I really don’t know what more I can do. I mean, nothing. It’s all on them. It’s their choice, but I don’t want to make them feel guilty for leaning on me when I don’t think I’m strong enough to help them through. I honestly still haven’t been able to fully work through it. My brother is being radically honest and sees me as his champion because I’ve fought for him to get sober since the beginning, and my parents have just shut down. 

I wish I could just be honest with everyone, but just like when I was a kid, I choose to make myself invisible instead of possibly inconveniencing them with what I need (emotionally). Especially when they’re going through so much. 

I don’t expect advice. I just needed to get this out. My brother has his CD eval today and then court on Tuesday from his last DUI arrest, where he may get arrested again for the hit and run – since he still has that warrant out.",2,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988077878952026}"

My sister (40s) is an addict. She’s always been a user of various drugs in varying levels, but about 9 years ago she fell pretty heavily into the ice scene and it’s spiralled from there. The last 8 years have been horrific for my family, my parents have been raising her children as she’s been incapable/it’s been unsafe. She’s been in and out of prison, in and out of rehab, just plain missing and when she has been home she’s been abusive, particularly towards her mother. It’s taken a huge toll on her kids, as she swans in on a good day and promises them the world and then vanishes. They’ve seen her violent rages, and this has both terrified them and also modelled violent behaviour, particularly for the youngest who is now getting into trouble for fighting at school. She’s had friends rob my parents house, my house and god knows how many others for drug money. My parents can’t even go away for a weekend in fear of getting rolled over and over again. 

My parents have tried to help, they have always allowed her to come home so that she is not on the streets, they’ve funded countless rounds of rehab. My dad has struggled with this for a long time but has continued for my step moms sake, because even through all of this, she’s her daughter and doesn’t want her to die on the streets. But they have now busted her in their home with a very underage kid dealing and doing drugs (which her own kids walked in on). My dad has said no more and has kicked her out, and told her in no uncertain terms that she’s not welcome back. 

I guess I’m asking if there is anything else we can do to try to get through to her? I don’t believe we’ve done the wrong thing finally cutting her off as it’s just unsafe for the kids, completely unacceptable. I know she needs to want to help herself before she’ll get anywhere, but is there anything that anyone here experienced that got them to the point of wanting to help themselves?",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9967798590660095}"

It was mostly smooth sailing off of it, but I was young, tapered off of it, and went to some cushy place in Florida. I’m 25 now, jobless, depressed, on Medicaid, and feeding/cleaning house for my grandparents and disabled mother. I’m drinking every night but I don’t think they know the extent of it. My s/o partakes but has much greater self-control than I do and I feel like he’d be okay if I left again, maybe it’d even be a wake-up call for him.   

Thing is- I don’t want to tell anyone I’m going until I’ve gone. I know he’d try to talk me out of it, suggest cutting back like we’ve tried before. I’m just so tired of being tired. My stomach hurts. My head hurts. I have diarrhea almost every morning. It all just fucking sucks. I want to rip it off like a band aid.   

One of the people I trust most just stopped drinking without rehab or inpatient intervention and I respect the fuck out of her for it, but I don’t think I realistically could do that myself. Honestly if I were going to tell anyone about this it would be her, but she’s kind of who got me into this mess to begin with (in a way.)   
 
I don’t want to hurt anyone by leaving abruptly, but that’s how I did it the first time. I decided the night before, they set me up, and I left the next morning. I was 18 and it was the first time I’d ever flown alone. My mom refused to take me so I had to have a friend of a friend drive me to the airport.  I honestly believe that if I don’t do it this way then I won’t do it until it almost kills me.

Getting the train back from the interview I passed several pubs plus there was alcohol on the train and I have no idea how I'm going to cope with doing nothing for 4 days, especially if I don't hear back from work.  


The interview is incredibly important as the new role would make me properly secure at work and my current one could possibly be cut from the budget.

He is a friendly guy with a lot of friends. He’s mild tempered and mild mannered. He’s never caused harm to another being, abides by the basic laws of society and had a perfectly clean record.

One day Doug is out riding his bicycle and gets struck by a car. He gets treated at the hospital and for his recovery is given pain meds. One day he runs out of his pain meds; he starts vomiting, has diarrhea and more pain than he could ever imagine. The doctor won’t prescribe more meds and his insurance refuses to cover the $900 a day for a basic rehab facility. All he wants to do is alleviate the anguish until he can figure out what to do in order to get his life back on track, so he illegally acquires some pills from a friend of a friend. Unbeknownst to him this person is under surveillance.

A few days later the police show up at his house to inform him that they have him on film purchasing drugs from a known dealer. Doug is booked into county jail where he is surrounded by real criminals, until he is able to make bail. A year of court proceedings ensue until the prosecutor has a “sweet” deal to offer him; accept a felony charge, four months in jail and three years of probation or he could take a gamble by going to trial and risk up to six years in prison. Out of fear Doug accepts the deal, Doug Felone is now a drug felon.

Upon his release from jail, he is now clean and starting life over again. He goes out to apply for jobs but ends up getting turned down at every place he applies due to his felony record. His years and money spent in college are now worthless, yet he still owes tens of thousands in student loan debt. In addition to that it is also difficult for him to find a decent place to live, he is finding that most leasing agencies won’t rent to felons, regardless of having good credit and an eviction-free record. Many of his friends no longer want to associate with him, not because his was an addict for a brief time, but because he is now considered a criminal. Everything he has worked for in his life has now gone to waste. Doug is now a second rate citizen who can no longer contribute to society in ways he was once able to.

Doug feels as though he is left with only two options. First option is to work a menial, low paying job in which he will never get caught up in life and will never be financially stable again. The second option appears to be more lucrative, however it may involve scamming others, selling drugs or robbery.

There is a reason the crime recidivism rate is much higher for a felon as compared to someone with a misdemeanor or someone who is given the option of court ordered rehab. It may be easy to judge someone based on the fact they are or once were an addict, however it’s not always that black and white. Some others grow up in a household where addiction is rampant and it is all they know. Regardless of how they became an addict, do they deserve the right to have a fair chance at life, or should they forever be labeled a felon and be treated as such? What option would YOU take if you were in Doug’s shoes?

Limiting felons from equal employment opportunities causes an estimated loss of $87 billion in gross domestic product every year in the US. In addition it leads to non-violent criminals finding other ways to get ahead in life, such as committing crimes which can cause harm to others.",58,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.995640754699707}"

Currently it is 3:30 in the morning and I am having a very difficult time falling to sleep and I just needed to kind of vent and get some advice if that’s okay! None of my friends are awake right now and I wouldn’t necessarily want to bother any of them with this anyway. 

Let me preface this by informing you all of my prior experience with drugs. I’ve done molly, LSD, shrooms, weed, alcohol, and oxycodone(one time), and cocaine(obviously). Before this whole situation I considered myself kind of gifted with the art of self control and not becoming addicted to things that I knew were bad for me. For 2 days after the first time I did molly I had to try really hard not to do it again because I knew I would screw myself over. And I’ve only done it one time after that. However, cocaine is a different story. 

I’ve been diagnosed with severe depression, bipolar disorder, BPD, and a few other mental infrequencies up in my head. The friends that I run around with have most of the same problems I do and we usually chill in my room and listen to music very loudly and occasionally get high. We are the type of group that can’t function properly without music playing. We get in the car and as soon as we get out to wherever we were driving, we all put in headphones and walk around with one earphone in each. It’s nothing personal we just all deal with hella traumas and music is a good coping mechanism. Now, one night we decided to try coke and we all made absolutely certain that we were ONLY GOING TO DO IT ONCE. We bought a gram and we all (4 of us) finished it up that night. And for a good month, none of us did it again. However, 3 weeks ago, I was going through some very emotional stuff and was really considering harming myself(which i’ve done before) I had 70$ in my pocket and decided that cocaine was better for me than cutting my arms (to this day I don’t know which would have been the better option). I bought a gram of coke and did it alone in my room. Instantly felt amazing. I took a shower and danced the entire time. Got out of the shower, took another line, went outside, started texting my female friends random ass videos cause I had so much energy. And by 4:40am I had run out of coke. I believe that at this point I still had the ability to save myself. But the next day, I bought another gram, and another, and another. I ran out of money so I sold my camera, computer, and xbox, I had 2000$. Over the next 2 weeks. Spent it all on coke. I met up with my friends a few times and they did it again too. None are as addicted as I am though. It got to the point where I physically couldn’t be happy or energetic without it. It’s all I wanted. 

Now. RIGHT NOW. i’m on a family trip and I have to go 3 days without it. It’s bedtime and I CANNOT SLEEP, i’m just craving that energy so badly. Im listening to music and doing everything I can but nothing is working. On top of that, depression is haunting me once again and I really don’t know what to do. Sorry if that was a lot to read and a little confusing. I just need 1.) how to fall asleep and 2.) when i get home, how to quit. Thanks!!

I came home and have now spent $600 out of $800 in savings in 5 days on cocaine.

I never could control myself in the moment, it was only by stopping entirely, just saying no, I got sober in the first place. It is my idea to just fucking finish it, and never buy more.

Hi , 

I’m a long time Reddit reader, first time reddit poster so forgive me if I posted this in the wrong community. 

Basically, I’m addicted to cocaine and I’m ready to quit. I have tried a handful of times in the past, Gave it up for a few weeks and then found a way to convince myself to do it. 

I never used to have an addictive personality, I have tried other drugs (molly, weed, lsd etc) and was able to control any impulse to use keeping it to limited occasions, however with cocaine I always find a way to convince myself to do it, thinking it’ll be different or something.  

I’ve been doing it for about two years now, it started off as a way to self medicate and deal with my depression however Ive realized that it is not the way to deal with this and have accepted that I am addicted. I’ve overdosed, had it ruin my relationships with my mom and boyfriend, dropped out of school, and  pretty much just ruined any motivation I had to do shit with my life.

My life has not been the easiest. But I must explain... I (29F) met My love when we were just 14 years old... I lost my virginity to him and was head over heels.. shortly after this I found out he was addicted to pain pills when I saw him withdrawal for the first time. I think I knew then that this was something I was way too young for but I was already so in love I stayed... I stayed for 15 years. And through these years I’ve helped him recover from pills, then meth and then alcohol... My own father was also an addict and after he was murdered I think it sobered him up and kind of opened his eyes.. My Love is now going to be 30. We have two kids and a beautiful home and what looks like a normal life... but something in my gut told me it wasn’t as good as I thought.. I recently found Out My Love has relapsed and been shooting heroine and smoking meth again. But after all these years, all the pain and lies, after seeing the path my own father went down, My heart just isn’t in it anymore. I do not want to stay or help. My duty is to my children and I want a better life for us than this. After 15 years of my loyalty and love I feel so betrayed. I feel resentful and angry that he would do this to me. Especially after everything I went through with my own father.. I found him a place to go. I even told him I would pay half just to get him on his feet. But I feel awful. I’m terrified that once he goes he will spiral and end up dead. But I’m so tired. He’s not the person I fell in love with. I just want him to go. Am I a bad person? Am I doing the wrong thing?

I know my addiction will only end in death, jail, or illness.

I can't live like this.

“I AM METH”

(This was written by a young Indian girl who was in jail for drug charges, and was addicted to meth. She wrote this while in jail. As you will soon read, she fully grasped the horrors of the drug, as she tells in this simple, yet profound poem. She was released from jail, but, true to her story, the drug owned her. They found her dead not long after, with the needle still in her arm.)

Please keep praying for our Children, Teens, Young adults. Understand, this thing is worse than any of us realize …

I destroy homes, I tear families apart,
I take your children, and that’s just the start.

I’m more costly than diamonds, more precious than gold,
The sorrow I bring is a sight to behold.

If you need me, remember I’m easily found,
I live all around you – in schools and in town

I live with the rich, I live with the poor,
I live down the street, and maybe next door.

I’m made in a lab, but not like you think,
I can be made under the kitchen sink.

In your child’s closet, and even in the woods,
If this scares you to death, well it certainly should.

I have many names, but there’s one you know best,
I’m sure you’ve heard of me, my name is crystal meth.

My power is awesome, try me you’ll see,
But if you do, you may never break free.

Just try me once and I might let you go,
But try me twice, and I’ll own your soul.

When I possess you, you’ll steal and you’ll lie,
You do what you have to — just to get high.

The crimes you’ll commit for my narcotic charms
Will be worth the pleasure you’ll feel in your arms.

You’ll lie to your mother, you’ll steal from your dad,
When you see their tears, you should feel sad.

But you’ll forget your morals and how you were raised,
I’ll be your conscience, I’ll teach you my ways.

I take kids from parents, and parents from kids,
I turn people from God, and separate friends.

I’ll take everything from you, your looks and your pride,
I’ll be with you always — right by your side.

You’ll give up everything – your family, your home,
Your friends, your money, then you’ll be alone.

I’ll take and take, till you have nothing more to give,
When I’m finished with you, you’ll be lucky to live.

If you try me be warned – this is no game,
If given the chance, I’ll drive you insane.

I’ll ravish your body, I’ll control your mind,
I’ll own you completely, your soul will be mine.

The nightmares I’ll give you while lying in bed,
The voices you’ll hear, from inside your head.

The sweats, the shakes, the visions you’ll see,
I want you to know, these are all gifts from me.

But then it’s too late, and you’ll know in your heart,
That you are mine, and we shall not part.

You’ll regret that you tried me, they always do,
But you came to me, not I to you.

You knew this would happen, many times you were told,
But you challenged my power, and chose to be bold.

You could have said no, and just walked away,
If you could live that day over, now what would you say?

I’ll be your master, you will be my slave,
I’ll even go with you, when you go to your grave.

Now that you have met me, what will you do?
Will you try me or not? It’s all up to you.

I can bring you more misery than words can tell,
Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.",43,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.998188316822052}"

2020-03-08 15:07:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ffh9pi/i_need_help/,I need help.,"Hey everyone. 

I wasn't quite sure where to post this, but I need to get all of this off my chest and could really use some advice/feedback on my situation.

A little background information about me, I am a 24 y/o guy currently in treatment for opioid addiction. I have also dabbled heavily in taking basically every drug you could think of. I started out maintenance treatment taking Suboxone about three years ago and ultimately switched to Methadone maintenance about a year and a half ago. I take 105mg of methadone daily. 
I received a call from my clinic and my grant (which pays for my treatment) is going to end the on May 31st. So obviously this is really stressing me out. I currently stay in a transitional housing environment and volunteer on a daily basis to keep a bed here. I can't go out and work a day job because I have to be here ""volunteering"" or I'd basically be to the point of sleeping outdoors.
What I am about to say may sound odd, I haven't told anyone about this aside from two of my close friends. I am addicted to Benadryl. For the past year I have augmented my methadone dose with 350mg + diphenhydramine daily. I do this because I believe I'm not at a dose which is properly maintaining me and my doctor at the clinic is very hesitant to go above 100mg in ANY of the patients.

More recently, the past couple months I have been regularly taking Xanax and Etizolam. I have started craving them pretty intensely. I do have panic disorder/generalized anxiety, I've dealt with it for as long as I can remember... and have been prescribed benzos in the past, and have definitely acquired an extreme liking for them. 

Today, I've probably taken upwards of 5,000mg + of gabapentin and I feel the urge to keep eating them. I am so sick of my situation and I just want out. I can't do this anymore. I am super depressed. I've dug myself so deep. I don't feel like I can get out.

I have asked him more than once to keep his drugs outside the walls of our home even more so now that we have a baby. I get that he can't stop himself from getting high but I struggle with believing that the addiction makes him unable to keep his drugs in his vehicle or the garage. 

Is that a wrong assumption? 

We have been in conversations about him moving out as he cannot live under the same roof as the baby while he is actively using. He's been stalling of course. He had told me he'd be gone by end of Feb, and he's not and I found residue and paraphernalia in our home. I'm going to as him to find a place to sleep for the next couple of nights. 

He's broke and has nowhere to go long term and I have been struggling with putting him on the street essentially. He does have a stable job. Anyone have lived something similar? 

My ideal arrangement would be A) he's sober 100% and we live as a family, B) if he's using, we live separately, he can see our son (in my presence) as long as he can pass a drug test. Is that too off the wall and controlling? I want him to have a relationship with our son but I also want to protect our son from his drug abuse.

I'm autistic (high functioning) and previously have been been trusting and a bit naive about drug use in both partners and workmates, and am worried that I'm missing what to most people might be obvious signs of drug use.

I have mixed feelings of semi-discomfort and hoping Reddit might be able to clarify or pick up on stuff I might not realise are clear signs of addiction/use of something specific.

Guy is in early 40s, quite well spoken and smart, but a bit scattered. Has a skin condition he says is from low vitamin D, definitely matches the images online of vitiligo. Swears he hadn't had a drink since Christmas before meeting me in the last couple of weeks, but on several dates he has drunk quite a bit and has been very insistent on what to me is more alcohol than I really would like. I do sometimes drink a little bit to excess, but usually in a more party setting? There's an insistence on drinking that I'm finding uncomfortable. He has not forced anything though, just been encouraging of more excess than I really want to indulge in.

I have not been able to really see any obvious evidence of anything but former partners and ppl were very good at hiding & I was just very bad at seeing signs.

One thing that struck me though is his pupils seemed fairly small. Not pinpricks, but smaller than I think I'd expect in lower light conditions.

Kissing also pretty strange - extremely minimal. However does show physical affection in more firm shoulder/neck massage than I think is usual. Feels a bit wooden or lacking nuance/sensitivity.

And sex underwhelming, no orgasm on his part and not huge interest in sex, but able to function? 

I don't know if this is enough information to go on really.

I know I'm a bit stressed at the moment though and not sure if I'm just highly strung and over reacting to things that could be perfectly reasonable? Happy to answer any questions if that might help identify anything specific.

But as of lately I have been taking Oxys from time to time and Vyvanse plus anything else I can get my hands on. 

Wtf should I do? Im studying, working hard, gotta pay my rent etc and I have a kid. I cant go to rehab, it doesnt work..... I lost my driving license due to the fkn weed and that makes going to places like open addiction therapy hard as hell. Im stuck here.

Im far from rock bottom right now but im depressed and an addict. I have ""only"" lost my license and my gun. I still have alot, but I know that as an addict I will loose it all if I continue.

The good thing is that I cant take Oxys for long, my parents dont take them no more so I cant steal them forever and I never buy hard drugs myself.

In order what lead me to where I am, I continued to drink alcohol occaisanly under these 7 years clean from drugs, yes alcohol is a drug but still. Alcohol - Marijuana - Vyvanse - occaisionaly speed from a friend - Benzos - Oxys.

Im terrified of life sober. It all escalated when I lost my driving license and my gun license, I got into a depression.

The night started out normally, went to the bar with some guys after work and got pretty drunk. On the way home I decided to stop in at my local spot to grab a few more. Long story short I saw another regular and he and I split a bag of coke. Many more drinks and the whole bag later I stumble home, scrape the rest of the bag out, put it up my nose then smoke a little weed. It's about 4 am and Im absolutely twisted but for some reason I decide I need more coke. I started calling every number in my phone to no avail, so I take to the streets. I meet I guy and ask him for coke, he tells me he has no coke but he has crystal so I go to a park with him and smoke it. This guy didn't look like any tweaker I'd seen and he kept talking about his wife and kids. I'm gonna preface this part by saying I'm not gay in the slightest. Eventually he grabs my dick and starts working it and even goes down on me a bit. I was basically asleep but still propped up by the coke and meth to know what was going on, but for some reason I didn't stop him. After, he helped me up picked up my wallet and phone off the ground and gave them to me and even walked me to my street. 

Waking up today I felt the most powerful sense of fear and self loathing I've ever experienced. I've already scheduled a doctor's appointment to get checked just in case. I know I need to stop doing coke because it's what pushes me to the extremes but I know drinking is what pushes me to do coke and I don't think I'm able to stop drinking. It helps me forget all the shit like this I've done and the thought of facing those memories and my unbridled inner dialogue terrifies me. 

Idk why I wrote this or what I think will come of it but here it is anyway. I know I need help I just don't know how and where to start.

My parents hate addiction. If I think about it now, everybody is addicted to something, although it is rare to find an addiction as crippling as drug addiction, opioids to be specific. My mom could never accept the fact that one of her three children was an addict. He had been an addict his whole life; it is just the kind of addiction that has changed throughout. My mom reacted in anger. While the family was trying to help my brother, Douglas, past it, she threw adversity in his face day in and day out. My father, sister and I would have long, heart-felt, and raw conversations with Douglas. We talked about everything from how to treat people with respect, to suggesting rehabs for him.  When he had stolen money from my father, my dad forgave Douglas, but my mother said he should probably move out. My mom comes from a ‘no bullshit’ household. She is a first generation American, being born the middle of three girls to a French army veteran and an Italian nurse. As she has told me, her father brought some of the attitudes and intensity of the French military into their home growing up. She has been through the ringer of life and it shows. She is a short, blonde hair, brown eyed woman with an angry raspy voice. My dad on the other hand comes from a family without a father figure growing up. He is a tall, black hair, brown eyed man with a few extra pounds on him, he wants to spread happiness in every room he goes into. He laughs when he does not mean it, he will crack a joke no matter the mood he is in, and he thrives from making anybody smile. Most importantly, he wants to make sure his kids grow up *with* their dad. 

When Douglas was in early high school he would sneak into the woods near my house every day to smoke cigarettes and drink a few beers. He never had any remorse for anything that he did, in fact, he reacted angrily in times of learning. When my parents caught him, World War 3 broke out. From my memory all I saw were red faces of screaming, the feeling of things being thrown against the walls, and nasty name calling. My mother yelled things like, “you ungrateful son of a bitch, I can’t believe I brought you into this world, I can’t believe *I* raised you, you fucking delinquent”. 

While my fifteen-year-old brother would angrily snap back, “Maybe if you showed that you cared about me I wouldn’t be doing any of this, you goddamn bitch. I hate you. Literally any other woman on the planet would be a better mother than you”.

All this while my father sat there with his head in his hands, unsure who to side with. He knows that his wife is unfairly mean to Douglas, but he also knows that Douglas is going down a destructive life path, so he would just sit there silently and pull Douglas over later in the night to talk to him, really talk to him.

\*\*\*

My sister hates addiction. She also did not understand the people who suffer from it. She would often criticize Douglas for his actions and would berate him for his response of “I can’t help it sometimes”. She would try so hard, but she has a really difficult time understanding something unless she has been through it firsthand. My sister, Deanna, is the middle child of three. Just a year and a half younger than Douglas. Douglas and Deanna grew up as a pair. They did everything together as children. She did not understand why he started to grow apart from her when she was excelling in school and he wanted to be literally anywhere else. Deanna was always a long brown haired, brown eyed, beautiful girl. She was as close as you could get to a picturesque child in every way. She received straight A’s in school. She was an amazing singer who performed in numerous choir concerts throughout school. She respected herself, her peers, her family, and her elders. She never realized how strong she really was, remaining an emotional rock for myself, as all aspects of our family life began crashing down. Deanna was not self-confident. 

When Douglas began to come home from the woods every day with a stench of marijuana following him step by step like the demon it was for him, Deanna reacted with remorse and confusion. She would first ask the obvious, “why do you smell so bad?” When she finally figured out the reason she would usually hang her head low and go in her room for the rest of the day, responding with “I’m fine, I’m not the one you should all be worried about” when we knocked on the door and asked for her. Douglas knew that he was hurting Deanna with his antics, so in order to push her away, he would say despicable things to her so that eventually, she would hate him. That way, he would not be making his little sister as upset anymore. She began to cry when he would come home with his eyes redder, his shoulders more slouched, and his speech more slurred than when she saw him in school. He would then push her out of his way, call her a bitch, and tell her that she has no idea what she is talking about when she would ask him about what he’s doing. Then, one day Deanna decided if you can’t beat them, join them. She snuck into my father’s alcohol stash, she went to the woods she knew Douglas was in, and before she approached him, she began to attempt to finish an entire bottle of whisky. She stumbled over to my brother and his friends, and within minutes began to slur her words, she fell to the ground, and seized up. My brother did not believe her at first, but when it became obvious that she had just done something terrible, he called my parents and an ambulance. Every person in my family was in a state of shock and confusion. I do not believe I have ever been in a car that was driving faster than my fathers red pickup truck to that hospital. After she got her stomach pumped, neither my brother nor my sister said sorry to each other. In fact, they didn’t talk much at all after that. My sisters last ditch effort at regaining her brother’s friendship failed miserably. This began to be used as fuel for even worse behavior for Douglas.

\*\*\*

I hate addiction. I am the youngest of the three kids. Six years younger than my brother, four and a half years younger than my sister. Growing up, my siblings were already in a much more matured lifestyle than I, and my parents were already tearing apart at the seams. They no longer slept in the same bed. My dad would rather take us to hotels and spend a weekend with him than let us spend time with mom, they did not love each other anymore, in fact they hated each other. aI tried with all my might to be the family mediator. I figured I could use wit and wisdom to talk my family back down into being the stereotype loving family on TV, like the Brady Bunch. It did not work. I was consistently told I am too young, I know nothing. When I was a freshman in high school, Douglas was long out of high school. He still lived at home. Douglas had a heroin addiction; my whole family knew it. At this point, we just didn’t want to admit we had failed as a family unit. We failed to stay together, and we failed to keep Douglas safe.

I was addicted to playing video games in high school. I sat on my Xbox every day, for multiple hours a day. I played until 2:00 every morning, the earliest. In this freshman year, Douglas had a habit. He came home from a different friend’s house every single morning at 1:30 in the morning. Other than myself, the broken family unit was already in bed, dreaming about the life they wish they had. Douglas would immediately come to the basement to talk to me. His cheeks would be milky white, his eyes would be lifeless, and his body moved as if it was a glitch in a computer system. He often struggled completing an entire story, or even sentence, before he fell asleep. His mouth would be open, he lips were often puffy, he would be holding the creases of his arms, and he would be drooling on himself. It was at this point that I knew I had to finish up immersing myself in a world of fantasy, and embrace the cold, dark reality that I was living. Douglas would often wake himself up after a minute, look right through me, and run upstairs. Every night he then had the same routine. He threw his wallet on the table, used the bathroom, and jumped into bed. It was at this point that I would turn off the Xbox and go back upstairs. I opened his wallet and took the little baggie with brown powder in it, out of the wallet. I went and flushed it down the toilet. I would bring his wallet into his room and see him passed out asleep on his bed, shoes still on, above the covers. I put his wallet on his drawn-all-over dresser, untied his shoes and took them off, pulled the covers from under him, and put him under them. Sometimes I would even tuck him in, hoping if I did it tight enough, he couldn’t get out of bed to go repeat his habit in the morning. He always did. He did get up, and he did repeat his habit. His habit was his addiction.

\*\*\*

My brother hated addiction. Through early home videos, upon watching the memories my family made before I was born, I could tell Douglas was depressed from a very young age. He did not know how to cope with feeling anything but happy. So, when an artificial substance gave it to him, he told himself he needed it. It was not long before he really did physically need it. Douglas went through many different physical stages in his life. He always had long brown hair that would partially cover his eyes. He was always tall, but he was frequently changing body weights. He was once an extremely muscular kid, nobody wanted to mess with him. Once he was 250 pounds and did not move much, and once he was so skinny that you could count his ribs. It wasn’t long before I noticed his body type changed with his drug of choice. 

At twenty-one years old, Douglas decided he really needed to change his life around. That realization came after I was looking for something in my sweatshirt, (Douglas and I had the same sweatshirt, just different sizes) and my hand was pricked with a used needle. When he realized he had done something that harmed me, he said that would never happen again. Douglas then went to rehab. For 200 days he stayed there. He was the youngest kid there but was a breath of fresh air to his fellow patients. I knew this because when I would visit him once a month, there were multiple people my parents age who would come up and tell my parents they did a great job with Douglas. They would say they have not laughed or smiled as much as they have from spending time with Doug as they have in as long as they could remember. He was well loved, and he loved the fact that he knew it. Douglas was finally getting the right kind of attention, he thrived on attention and for the first time in his life it was the kind he has always wanted, positive attention. He began going to church, urging his friends and family to come with him. He was not allowed home too often due to the rules of rehab, although when he came home he looked spectacular. It was powerful to see my mother willingly go up to him and hug him, saying she is so proud of him. In that moment, the past was forgiven. My family began to mesh together again. We ate dinner as a family again, we shared stories and we shared laughs. When he finished his program, he kept this lifestyle going, I even began to find religion in myself because of him.

\*\*\*

God hates addiction. We are all supposed to be ideal human beings, so we can go to heaven. We strive to go to a place that we have no idea *truly* exists, but it gives us something to hope for. I bought it completely. We are told to be afraid of sin. If we sin we go to a place of fire, burning, death, fear, and all things ‘bad’. Once my brother began to find religion in himself I believe it was just another force that drove him away from the devil, heroin.

Douglas was home for two months. He cooked us dinner, he bought us things we wanted, he had a steady job, and he began to become the role model I always wanted. He did not do heroin anymore, he did not drink alcohol anymore either. Although, I would frequently hear him breathing heavily, almost whimpering, in his room at night. I knew there were still some inner demons left in him. Rehab can help addiction, but not depression. During the day, Douglas frequently looked for things to make him happy in short bursts, when he couldn’t find one, he got really upset.

One day, after two months of being home from rehab, 263 days of being clean, his best friend growing up, Eric, also graduated from rehab. Eric used to inject himself with heroin, right next to Douglas, every night. So now that they were both clean, they had to celebrate. Eric wanted to go out for a few drinks. Douglas struggled for a long time with if he wanted to even try drinking again. He was sick of the stigma of addiction and just wanted to live the life of a normal twenty-two-year-old, so he agreed. I remember is being in my basement, playing video games, when Douglas flew downstairs as excited as a kid on Christmas. He was clearly very drunk. I was frustrated with his decision to drink again, so I shut him down. I repeated myself, “just go to bed Doug, you are so annoying right now dude, just go to bed”. He proceeded to say goodnight, and head back upstairs. I went to bed an hour later. 

I was abruptly woken up early the next morning to pounding on Douglas’ bedroom door. Now this was *going* to be World War 3. My mother broke down the door, and gasped. Immediately she cries, “Oh my God, no, oh my god”. 

My reaction “UGH shut up mom! He probably snuck out of his room, you opened the door and he is not there now let me sleep”. 

She runs downstairs, dad comes up, I’ve never seen dad cry, I’ve only heard him scream maybe two times, dad screams “oh my god no” He breaks out into tears, “you mother fucker, you mother fucker, NO!” 

and I think “hmmmmmm”…

Then the words came that crashed on me harder than any others in the world. 

“That’s my boy, that’s my boy god, why god, why” all while screaming and crying. 

It hit me, Douglas is not okay, I’ve had this dream before though, I’m dreaming right, yeah! The dream always ends as soon as the cops enter my house so that’s what I waited for. They came in the door this time and my stomach dropped. I go to run out of my room and into his, there’s already a cop in his room and two more outside of it. The one outside says, “You don’t want to do this, this isn’t the last memory you want”, I ram in anyway. The cop in there sees me and picks me up physically and brings me out. On the way out I see it, my brother, the one who was colorful and alive six hours before…. On the ground, blue, eyes closed. I stop resisting and go into the kitchen to see my parents sobbing. They called for me to be picked up and brought to my aunt’s so that is where I went. 

Addiction is a terrible disease, it tears family’s apart, and it tears a person apart from themselves. It is easy to hate addiction, my family of five hate it, even god hates it, I believe that’s why he takes the people who suffer from it away from this Earth, so they can stop suffering.

My husband k39 m) is spending $1,000 a month on weed and cigarettes. ( that is close to half of what he took home last year) He lies and takes money for our family. I am very allergic to the smoke and it is negatively affecting my health. He knows what he is doing to my health and promises to stop.  I called off the wedding before were married multiple times. He always promised that he would stop. He begged for me to marry him. That he would never do it again. Then he says he needs it. Then he claims he didn't spend that much. He refuses to believe it. But the bank records prove it. 

In December he spent almost $2,000 on weed and didn't even get a Christmas present for me or an anniversary present. Nothing.  Weed was more important.  He keeps crying and making promises. But he never follows through.  

I have had to contribute every cent of my income and not be able to spend any money just to pay bills.  I needed a root canal and had to wait to get it done because he was spending the money on weed. He knew and promised he would stop, but of course he doesn't.  

He will get hundreds of dollars of weed and it is gone in 24 hours.  

My physical health is getting really bad. I have autoimmune issues and and allergic to the smoke. My allergies got worse after we got married. But that shouldn't master because he promised before we got married he would not smoke. 

I have tried to help him. I have tried to be tough. I have tried everything in between. He just won't stop. Meanwhile, my boss is worried about me because of the stress (and she didn't even know exactly what is happening). My doctors have told me I can't be around the smoke and he knows that. He just doesn't even shower when he comes in.  The smoke clings to him.  

Things are desperate. We have a court date next month. I wish we were not here. It sucks. 

And to add insult to injury, I had been receiving $28,000 a year in maintenance and I have that up to marry him.  I barely make mote than that.  I will have to give up my home because i can't afford it.  But the little that he gives covers hisinsurance, phone, has, extra food costs, and some extra... But the little extra that he duress contribute is small and not worth my physical and emotional health. 

I just need support.  I never thought I'd deal with Ann addict. I didn't realize he was addicted before. I thought it was just recreational... That is what he told me. But now he does admit addiction, but he does not want to change. 

I am physically hurting ( from the smoke affecting my health) and emotionally hurting from all the lies.  

I know some Will say that $1000 a month on weed is nor an addiction, but it is for him. He will do anything to get weed.  He would spend more if he could.  I have to pay bills the moment his partial paycheck hits or account or it is gone for more weed.  He had some money go to his account that I cannot get to.

Where I lived, addiction is a big issue. I lived in Vancouver (Canada) for a large portion of my life, but recently moved to Alberta, and I still talk to my old friends who live in Vancouver.

The thing is. Addiction is becoming a bigger and bigger issue in Vancouver. 

I recently found out via my childhood best friend, M, that a friend of ours, E, had died of a cocaine overdose. 

Her death has kinda shocked me and hit a bit hard. I don’t remember a lot about her, but like, the fact someone I knew just...sorta ceases to ‘exist’ now has kinda made me feel some kinda way. 

The thing that really fucked me up though is thinking how much addiction has just. Fucked me up in general. 

E died of a cocaine overdose. Me and M’s friend, N, is currently an addict and has been on and off of being homeless and an addict since 2015. The drugs turned her into a not great person... 

My brother is a recovering meth addict. My mom did meth when I was a kid too. 

And while talking to M about E, I found out M still does coke and molly. 

I myself am a step away from being an addict. I’m already addicted to a few less important things (smoker, a few other things), and I’m apparently a half step away from becoming an alcoholic. 

I don’t really know how to cope with this or what to do about it, I’m only 20, I shouldn’t be in a situation of planning what to do if M overdoses. I shouldn’t have a vivid memory of a kid (under 15) who died of overdose outside of my house and the fact my brother did CPR on her and that maybe if I had looked out my window and saw her on the ground before my brother got home, I could have helped. 

I just needed somewhere to get this off my mind. I’ve been mauling over it ever since I found out about E. I can’t help but stress myself out over what’d happen if N or M overdosed. I can’t help but stress about where I’m going to go in the future and if I’m going to end up turning to drugs as well. It sure as hell is tempting and it’s not like I haven’t tried. Though the drugs I’m in preference too are a lot lighter than coke and meth (I got a preference to things like benzos) And of course, some good ol alcohol. 

Idk man, it’s just fucked up, one friends already died, I’m just waiting for the rest to follow. 

Sorry if this isn’t appropriate for this sub. Not sure where to post it. Almost posted it to r/depression but realized it might fit this one better. If someone had a better idea where this could go I got no problems deleting it and reposting it to the other sub.

for some context i stopped abusing cough syrup/dxm on sunday last week and went pretty well for the first 4 days until thursday night (yesterday). 

i had a really fucking shitty day and couldn’t get happy. I really wanted to get high on something and get my mind off of everything. Well , since i don’t like weed and can’t access alcohol i figured my only choice would be dxm. I didn’t wanna do it but i felt like i had no choice since that’s the only mind altering substance i felt would work for me at the time. 

Going into it i knew that **this** was truly the last time. And i still feel that way. 

I’m actually enjoying being sober. 

DXM binges just take me out of reality for the entire duration of my usage and it gets really taxing. I picked up a new video game on my first day sober because i had to get my mind off of wanting to get high , since i dosed at nighttime , so i replaced getting high with playing a new game. 

It seems to be working for me. I’m also a lot more clear minded. My OCD isn’t as bad and i don’t have the twitches anymore (a side effect i get from dxm abuse).

Just to cut to the chase, I injured my back terribly at work about a year ago, and as a result I have been locked in my house because I can’t do much due to the pain. 

So one day I decided to take 120mg at once, (I was on 30mg IR), and that was the biggest mistake I had ever made. The god awful pain that kept me confined into a room locked up, suddenly wasn’t there and I felt like I was a superhuman. And that’s how it brought me to this point today. I had tried countless things for my back pain and nothing had ever worked, literally nothing whatsoever. Because of that, month after month, I blew through my 60 count scripts in 5 days, and if I was lucky it’d last up to 8/9. I sometimes would hit 300-500mg a day. I was cursed with an iron tolerance my whole life, but I’ve never been addicted to ANYTHING, literally ever. But here’s what my big thing about it is, I never stay up more than 72 hours, normally 48 was my limit. It’s an extremely weird addiction to me, because I’ve never been like cracked out, even at my highest dosage points. I interact with people perfectly fine, no one has ever noticed a thing or thought I was tweaking or even suspected anything. I drank water, ate at least twice every two days, I went back to college, I am getting dual MASTERS degrees, acing all my classes, my anger issues I had my whole life have disappeared I can literally keep myself calm through anything now, like it’s enhanced my life 10x. 

That is what is really freaking me out. I was going through 3600mg of adderall a month. I’d go a week on a week off, had a very um.. careless dr at the time. 

Fast forward to Wednesday of this week. I had enough of feeling all the guilt, and told myself it was time to stop. EVEN THOUGH that according to my Doctor, yes I said my DOCTOR, I am healthier than I’ve ever been! (Nuts right?) no health issues at all, no anything. 

Buuutttt, then I switched to a new shrink.. and he took me off adderall, and onto Ritalin. He prescribed me 20mg/3 times daily. 



That was Wednesday. It is now Saturday morning at 4am. 

My entire bottle is gone. I took 1,800mg in not even 3 days. I am not cracked out, I’m not tweaking, I’m perfectly fine and I am scared shirtless because I didnt even notice what in the hell I was doing until an hour ago. How am I not dead? How am I not tweaked out of my mind? The Ritalin wore off in less than a hour when I would take 60mg. I kept just taking 3 over and over and didn’t realize I hadn’t slept or ate since Wednesday. This is the first time I basically just spaced and time went by like this. I didn’t even hardly leave my room. But I cleaned it spotless and got about 4 weeks worth of online classes done. 

What I need help with is, what the hell happened? Was it the switch of drugs? Idk what to even think, and I’m even more terrified that I haven’t had a single bad side effect or anything. Well other than hours feeling like minutes. I’m scared all the damage is going to hit me at once because I am quitting all stimulates after this. 

Is quitting cold turkey a good idea? Or did I turn my body into a stimulant farm to the point where if I stop things will go horrible? I don’t even crave them or anything idk what to do. Please, if you have some advice help me. I can’t go through this again, nor do I want to risk it.

Seeking some advice. In college, \[friend\] and I were best friends. Though it wasn't the only thing we bonded over, alcohol was a major component of our times together. Looking back, much of this was 'problem drinking,' (binges, blackouts, etc.) but the feeling was 'hey, it's college.'

Toward the end of college, I had a series of epiphanies that (thankfully) steered me toward the path of self-care. Today, I drink infrequently and in moderation. \[Friend\] experienced no such reorientation; if anything, he doubled down, 'came to terms with' being an alcoholic, and I believe has now picked up a coke and cigarette habit to boot. We drifted apart pretty rapidly after college, due in part I think to me not wanting to party like I used to, though there are other factors at play too (physical distance, \[friend\]'s general psychological journey).

I want to reconnect with \[friend\]. He is a special person and means a lot to me. Also, if possible, I want to support him turning away from his self-destructive lifestyle. I feel partially responsible, given that I played a great part in ramping up these behaviors then stepped off the train when I'd had enough. Given his current lifestyle and our past together, I can't imagine a way to spend non-awkward quality time together without drinking. He would likely be drinking, so if I abstain, it will feel pointed and judgemental. But drinking with him would feel irresponsible, given that drinking is an addiction for him. Yet I know social isolation and/or being surrounded only by other users can play a major part in continuing an addiction. I'm wondering now if the benefits of reconnection, of reminding him that he has a friend and a safe space in me, outweigh the harms of drinking (in moderation) with him. After all, he's drinking anyway, with or without me. It's possible he will never stop drinking; does this mean I have to never again experience our friendship? Yes, of course, if our friendship is real we should be able to have it without alcohol; but I don't think he's ready for that at this point. Having a nice time together seems like the best way back into his heart, the only way I see to help him take the first step toward health.

I've been off alcohol for almost 3 months now. My life has drastically improved and I'm really happy that I made the choice to stop. I was never the type to ""black-out"" or lose my job or lose loved ones or ruin my health. I never drank at work or had financial issues but I was using alcohol for the wrong reasons are was starting to head down the bad road really quickly. I attend AA meetings once a week (which I've really learned to enjoy after some difficult initial meetings) and enjoy them, although I'm not doing the twelve steps and such.

It's all a bit confusing, but I'm happy not drinking. I'm like, REALLY happy.

The thing is, I'm off on a big, overseas holiday later this year with my mom. She's getting old and I want to spoil her and such. I really want to do things like try the wine, the beer, the gin where I'm going because I doubt I'll ever go there again.

I understand that addiction isn't a good thing. I get that using drugs has had a negative impact on my life, but I feel like the actual using of the drugs themselves affects my health over time, and that's it.  That's the only tangible thing that using drugs negatively impacts: my health gets worse gradually over the course of many years.  If this was the only problem about being a drug addict, that would be great. As it turns out, that is the only real negative effect caused by the drugs. All the other negative shit attached to drugs is a societal construct.  I find it easy to break this construct down, but it is impossible because it seems like everybody else is maintaining the negative mental constructs that cause addicts to lose everything.

No other addiction is demonized as badly as drug addiction.  What I see is entire societies becoming addicted to technology, yet no one seems to care about it.  I can't see why technology gets a pass and drugs don't.  I'll put it this way, if I am addicted to smoking heroin and meth everyday, I am basically creating another basic need for survival.  So I have food, water, clothing, shelter, and now heroin and meth.  Of course, we can add things like money, human interaction, and love to our list of basic needs.  Electricity has also become a basic need, and from that, technology.  How come this is ok with everybody,  but no one is ok with drugs being there also?  

If the grid went down, society would follow, in the meantime we are all addicted to our phones. Social media, video games, and just the way we rely on creepy AI pocket demon interfaces for everything. We even have our own separate digital lives these days.  Like drugs, there are negative impacts from our tech addiction.  The progression of this addiction to technology has a plethora of negative implications for our future, as well as some positive ones.  Drugs can also have positive impacts on our lives. We wouldn't use them otherwise, would we?

Did you ever think about how much of your life is spent doing things just because you think you are supposed to be doing them? Or all the time spent holding yourself back from things that you would like to be doing, but you don't do them because of the way you would be judged? Everyday more people are waking up and seeing how we have been played.  How we have been indoctrinated into believing a false narrative. Every horrible event in American history has been orchestrated. All these stupid unneeded laws have been put in place for their benefit.  I'm sick of it.  People are not nearly as bad as they want us to think.  We have all the tools to make this a place we all love to live in.  We have been tricked into living in a cage. Soon we will break out and know true freedom. And maybe, after that happens, I can get high and things will be alright.

She was released from the hospital after a night in the ER and she's still now because of antipsycotics that she was prescribed.

Her mental health clearly started taking a dive about two years ago when she started a failed business with her ex who was, and still has been, supplying her with meth* (he finally admitted this to my other sister over the phone just yesterday). She's been hearing voices in her head, has been having delusions about stuff happening to her skin, and has been falling for conspiracy theories.

I'm hoping to pull her out of Hawaii and live with my dad and seek treatment in Southern California where both my dad and other sister live (I'm all the way up in Oakland). This won't be easy because ultimately, it would mean uprooting her life in Hawaii where she's been living for 11 years. She's been trying to make money off of airbnb, but it doesn't seem like this has been going so well because honestly, she hasn't been able to plan and think through anything clearly. She also has trouble with the traffic court in Hawaii because of a suspended driver's license. However, these last two points are low priority and I'm willing to handle the logistics at some point. 

Most frightening of all is that I don't know exactly what I'll be dealing with. I've never had to handle an addiction situation before. The last few times I'd seen her, I couldn't tell at at all if my words were actually making it to her and I couldn't follow her thought process as she talked. She also kept rambling on about conspiracy theories without realizing that she wasn't actually having a conversation. Though her antipsycotics seem to be mellowing her out, I don't know if that means that she'll be easy to talk to and reason with.

If appreciate any advice I can get.

It's the result of 25 years of the UK NHS ignoring my complaints of bowel pain until finally they opened me up and the consultant surgeon responded with ""Oh........ fucking shit"".

So I'm on 150mg of morphine a day, even though everyone from me to my specialists know that it's the worst thing for me. Chronic Pain Syndrome the more strong analgesics you take the worse the pain gets. So over the next six months, I'm going to be weaned off.

Now my actual problem. I have panic attacks that lead to seizures. Bad seizures. My medics will give me 10x 5mg diazepam twice a year. It's not enough. So I have an online plug who is fucking awesome and supplies me with Serbian (Galenika) alprazolam (1mg), diazepam (10mg) and clonazepam (2mg). Alongside this, he can also get me Lyrica (400mg). It works. It really does, but I am aware of just how short the window is between working and addiction. I have a psychiatrist next week and I'm in two minds whether to tell him/her about this.

If I tell my GP what I'm doing they'll cut me off and never, EVER prescribe controlled drugs again. However, my shrink could find the fact that clonazepam works to stop my seizures (alprazolam is NOT legal in the UK).

What do I do?

I've had to destroy my career. My wife is a caregiver and all I do is cause her pain and hurt and although she refuses to agree I know I am dragging her down and she would be better off without me.

I had two accidental ODs in January from morphine and alprazolam mixed with a serious lung infection. I also discovered I am allergic to Narcan so when they hit me with it I went from a thready respiratory rate to my lung shutting down. After the second I'm ashamed to admit I was angry and upset that I woke up.

We have no children which make life easier. We chose not to given my physical problems and her serious depression. Who the fuck would force these genes on their children?

for background i’m 19. i’ve been using for a couple years on and off. i go on little 2-3 month binges every now and then. 

Anyways As the title states... 

if i had a time machine i would go back to the day i started using again and slap myself in the face. 

and that’s very true. After the last binge that ended in september of last year i told myself i was done. I wanted to be real with myself and believe that i was done for good but in the back of my mind i knew i’d be back. 

And look where i am now. One day sober since the beginning of January and i’m absolutely craving the feeling of using. You see, i’m alone in this hole that i dug for myself. No one knows what i’ve been doing. Not even my closest friends know and i want it to be that way. I don’t want them knowing they’re friends with a “junkie” who can’t put shit down. I’m alone in my addiction and i have no supporters. Last time i quit i had a very close friend helping me through withdrawals and supported me through it all. 

When i started using in january i was spacing out my usage. I would get high every week or so, maybe every couple weeks until it became a habit again. It was up until a few days ago when i realised i really had to make a change. I was wasting too much money on my habit and i was tired of it. I’m tired of spending all this money every single day. I’ve probably blown through maybe 300-400$ in the past 1-2 months alone on this addiction, although money isn’t too too much of an issue , It sucks thinking about how much more i could have if i didn’t spend it all on drugs and other bullshit i use. 

This fucking sucks. 

I woke up this morning feeling great about my decision and felt that way up until nighttime because that’s when i dose. Once i get home from work (around 11) i’d dose and be high all night. I knew nighttime was going to be hard and now it’s all hitting me. I told myself during the past couple months that i can stop whenever i feel like it’s becoming a serious problem, which is true because the past few times i stopped with no problem. This time is different, this time i feel like i can’t stop. I’m in such a deep hole that even light doesn’t reach me. I feel like i have no hope. 

I feel the withdrawals creeping up on me and i know it’s only gonna get worse. I feel like quitting this drug is going to do nothing for me. I’m gonna gain a bunch of weight and i feel like i won’t be happy anymore. I feel like all my happiness has turned to anger these last few months. I can’t get happy until i’m high and i’m scared once i quit i’ll be miserable everyday. 

I don’t want to check into any facilities. Because i feel like i’m probably overreacting to all this but at the same time idk. 


And that’s all i really have to say for now. If you made it this far i appreciate you. I don’t expect anyone to read this and i’m kinda just writing this to vent out my emotions sorta.

Then I bought a pack of disposable vapes. “Just to curb the stress.” Now I have a refillable pod vape and I didn’t even feel the slide downhill happening. As I plugged the thing in to charge, I just started feeling like I couldn’t face my own relapse anymore.

WHAT I HAVE LEARNED (thus far)

1.

anger is not sustainable (you cannot sustain (active) anger over long periods of time. it is exhausting, will make you physically, mentally and worst yet, spiritually sick.) it can also weaken your resolve in abstaining from substances.


2.

   a.   argumentation is a skill, being argumentative is a sign/red flag

    b.   a sign/red flag is much like an old fashioned theatre marquee flashing ""UNSTABLE""


3.

you can deflect, deny, filibuster, accuse, attack, obstruct and continue to act out,  fearfully... but it won't change what the Truth is.

ultimately however, we make our own decisions and thusly are responsible for each and every one of them.

deflection promotes the disease of addiction whereas self reflection and introspection promotes wellness in all areas of life.


4.

(struggling with) spirituality/belief system ~ burning bushes *rarely* happen... even in the bible.

because HP (a higher power,  greater thank you) sometimes speaks in whispers, we must listen... in order to receive, learn, practice and pass on to another, we must truly be quiet and listen.

quiet your mind, your heart... let your spirit settle... and Listen. Learn. Live, and Live Well.

I am planning to leave as he is very unpleasant and it’s become toxic for me. I don’t want to be yelled at everyday and to be told I’m all these horrible names. 

He drinks every single day, has a huge weed problem i think he also has an addiction to prescription painkillers that he legitimately gets on script. 

I am having tests for MS at the moment which he doesn’t know about as I can’t deal with the nastiness that will come out. I lost my mom this year and it’s been tough, I have recently been given some painkillers from the doctor to deal with the awful nerve pain I get. I take it when necessary and can take or leave it, I’m not addicted and my doctor has verified this. I’m also a medical professional myself so am all too aware of the consequences of drugs. My partner has got drunk again tonight and has brought up that he has seen the tramadol I’ve been prescribed (I very rarely take it and it’s there in a small amount as a last resort option for a few months now) and it’s been there a while now. I usually take all my meds out with me whenever i leave the house as I know he will get them if he can access them. I have left maybe 8 capsules in a drawer by my bedside (we have separate rooms so he would have to have made an effort to go through my things to find them) and tonight when drunk has randomly brought it up. His GP knows he’s addicted and this has not gone down well, I personally think they’re into him as I sat in on his last consultation and they are sick of him, but he always thinks he knows best. He uses anger and intimidating behaviour to try and put his ‘case’ across. He tells them he’ll just drink I read. He becomes like an angry, spoilt child when told no. I personally think his supposed knee pain is not the issue or he would have attended physio etc but he never shows up for it, all he wants is drugs.. 

My question is, Is it addict behaviour for them to seek out their ‘fix’ wherever, no matter what? like my meds are for a real pain problem and potentially a very serious one, and yet he speaks to me as though he is entitled to them and accused me of lying.. they’re *my* meds and yet he is angry because I haven’t given them to him, and don’t intend to. 

It’s almost like they don’t care that they’re taking stuff away from someone who actually might NEED it and get angry when their sense of entitlement is denied. He isn’t bothered about the consequences to me and seems to think I’m the issue for not giving him it. 
It gets nasty and argumentative and tonight yet again I’ve walked away and gone to bed. 

I have never been with any kind of addict before and have certainly never lived with it. He is what you may call a ‘high functioning’ addict in that he has a professional job and no one has a clue what he’s like at home.. 
I guess I’m just feeling a bit scared and a bit alone.

She was a cocaine addict and abused LSD as well as alcohol for 2.5 years. She was 2 years sober from the cocaine and LSD though continued sporadic periods of heavy drinking. She now spends almost all her nights out drinking and doing MDMA and Ketamine. I told her I was concerned with how depressed and distant she’s seemed. She doesn’t see any problem and lashed out. I’m really worried about her but I don’t know what to say about her drug use. She didn’t seem to hear at all that I was concerned and basically just said any emotional distance is all in my head and I’m just trying to cop out of coming to visit her. This is very similar behaviour to when she was on cocaine - she even admitted to trying some again recently but claimed it wasn’t any good so she didn’t buy any more. All of her current friends are into the same things. Advice?,2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981556534767151}"
2020-03-01 07:09:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fbt6vz/im_an_addict/,I’m An Addict,"Hi, I’m a gambling addict and I need help. Any advice and motivation is appreciated.

My current part time job for the past ~5 years on and off involves playing a popular game that has a gambling scene. You can calculate odds so that they’re in your favor when done correctly.The game has an economy that is easily transferrable to real money. Shitty streaks/“bad beats” happen, but this is not my problem..

Sometimes when I get streaked and lose a lot of money; or simply there is no action and no one is betting, I get restless and irritated. Tons of people partake in a 50/50 gambling aspect of the game. When I’m having one of these rough days I’ll head over and start gambling instead of making sure the odds are in my favor. I’ll lose anywhere from $500-5k in a night and rarely win. As many of you know, the times you do win fuel your urge to go back and ultimately have you lose. 

I’ve lost somewhere in the neighborhood of $60k on this game, but you can make so much money so quickly that I convince my sick mind it’s a smart idea each time I resort to gambling.

I recently downloaded the pokerstars app. Saw an advertisement with an initial match deposit, and loaded in $25. Lost and won a couple spin and go poker tournaments. On my 3rd $25 3 player tournament, the prize pool landed on $625. The website says the odds of this happening are 1,000/1,000,000 (0.1%). I ended up winning. 

Told customer support I don’t trust myself and to let me withdraw immediately instead of in 48h. Withdrew the money.

After the despot hit yesterday I started adding more money back and playing more tournaments, chasing my high. Poker with an aspect of spinning a prize wheel to win up to a million dollars? What a crazy high, how could I say no? I’m only risking 1/25 of what I made after all.

Loss after loss, bad beat after bad beat, hypnotic deposit after hypnotic deposit, I lost the whole $625 back. I only won a handful out of all the rest. It felt like the app had it out for me. The craziest bs happening, it was making me feel insane. I can’t believe I just lost all of that money back in two days.

I need to quit. If I just worked my job without resulting to this hypnotizing headspace I’d potential riches I would be well off right now. I want to quit and be over with this. I feel disgusted with myself after every loss, only to be fueled by the memorized of past wins to continue in this sick behavior.

I still feel like chucking money 50/50. I still feel like depositing more money on pokerstars. How do I get rid of these sick desires?

What’s the worst place gambling has ever taken you to? Did you heal and bring yourself out of that rut? Do you have any advice for me and others to get out and stay out of that rut?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9830701947212219}"
2020-03-01 06:54:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/fbt21m/an_addiction_story/,An addiction story,"When I got off heroin about 6 years ago, I went through a phase where I would do just about ANYTHING to get off. I had convinced a doctor that I needed a script for Xanax; when I took it, I never just took one pill, it was always a few. That + some weed and I felt golden again. Aside from the fact that I was just substituting addictions, the problem was that all the Xanax would completely obliterate my inhibitions. 

One day I did my usual thing, a handful of pills and some weed, and I decided to drive downtown to see if I could find SOMETHING else. I didn’t care what. I ended up meeting a guy named Chuck. Chuck was a crackhead. I had money and wanted to get high(er), so Chuck took me to his spot. 

Boy, did I get high... Crack was something else. We sat in my Jeep and started to talk. Before I knew it, the conversation had gotten very deep. I was an affluent kid, I come from a great family who loves me, I went to good schools, etc. Chuck had a hell of a life. No father, homeless, broken in so many ways. 

As we sat there and I told him about my life, Chuck said something to me that I will never forget: “Man, what are you doin’ down here with me?? If you got it like that, why you livin’ like this??” I was stunned. For a brief moment, he put everything into perspective. I had no answer to his question. I realized that Chuck was a human in pain, not just a crackhead. How could a guy whom I had just met, who was sitting in my car smoking crack with me, have so much compassion for me? 

His words have stuck with me ever since that day. When I’m struggling, wanting to get high (after 6 years clean at this point), I think about Chuck. “If you got it like that, why you livin’ like this?” I have a great life, one that I wouldn’t give up for anything. Hopefully his words will resonate with some of you like it did for me. Thanks, Chuck.",208,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9814655780792236}"

This past week has been the worst it’s ever been because his girlfriend kicked him out and he refuses to stay with my other brother or my parents and I, he resorts to sleeping in his car and has been ignoring phone calls. The only person he’s talked to is his sons mom but only to talk on the phone with his son. 

As I’ve mentioned his problem is on going and a couple months ago he had told me he had been arrested for a DUI during the summer. Of course he was drunk when he told me this but I was able to pull up the court records online and realized he was telling the truth. He had begged me not to tell anyone and me and his girlfriend (the one who just kicked him out) are the only one that know about his arrest. I’m extremely conflicted and don’t know whether to tell the rest of my siblings or my parents. My brother and I used to be best friends and although he’s been distant since he’s developed his addiction, I’m scared that he will never trust me again as his sister. Should I reach out to his girlfriend and ask her what really happened? Should I talk to my brother directly about it? Or should I just tell my family in hope that he’ll end up getting help? 

I’ve never been in this situation before and would really appreciate some advice.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985910058021545}"
