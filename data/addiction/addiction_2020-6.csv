I was in the workforce since I was 14. I moved out at 18 with my sweetheart and we were hard up but it wasn't bad. Several years later I'm single and get a place with a friend. We worked in the restaurant business together.

Soon enough, everyone is doing hard drugs and our decorated apartment slowly became the place where coworkers, acquaintances, and druggies came to party and it soon looked like a hellhole.

Before I knew it, despite us all working, we were living literally day by day. We would not have survived if we didn't work in a restaurant and could make ourselves a meal before going home.

Pretty soon a large majority of my funds went to getting high. I didn't need food or heat or AC. If we were fucked up then we were good. It got to a point where we rented out a safe place for all types of people to stay for hard up cash. Some for a couple days, some for months.

When it was at its worst, Id have to wake up and do what I called a 'trifecta'. First thing in the morning was a line approximately 1/3 meth, 1/3 heroin, 1/3 cocaine. It was the best feeling in the world for a good amount of time.

Eventually I started doing meth more and more because I wouldn't have to eat. That's how I saved money. When I did eat, It was vegetables out of a can. I lived off of microwaved canned vegetables for over a year because it was cheap but gave me energy.

I pawned a lot of things. I moved drugs just to have a few dollars. Our electricity or water or internet went out monthly. I lost my job and burned through my savings. Eventually I found myself alone in an apartment, with no power, water or internet. I lived on canned veggies and what I could get from family or friends.

Never again, I say. I have a job now I enjoy and restored my relationships with my family and closest friends. I'm on a career path and have a savings and people who love me. I love them, too.

I don't know what prompted me to do this, but I promise you if you are struggling, if you fight for yourself, you will get through it. Good luck and much love to all who find this.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5709022283554077}"

He drinks every day, some days it's a lot, some days just a couple but it's every day. When he's with his friends, the amount he drinks typically increases significantly and he usually loses count of how many he's had. Last night he went to see a friend of his who just bought a house and had a BBQ with another friend of theirs. I get concerned every time he sees his friends when it comes to his drinking and I know for a fact that this would not be the first time he's had too much to drink and then gotten behind the wheel.  Ive talked to him about this tons of times and offered to drive him, told him to take an uber and told him not to, he tends to agree when we're speaking about it but I don't know if it's just to shut me up or not.  One of the biggest things that bothers me is that he tends to think he is invincible and downplays the severity of a lot of things, including getting in actual trouble or hurting someone. 

As soon as he got home last night, he was acting like he'd had a few too many drinks and he threw up this morning and has been sleeping all morning, which only ever happens when he's hungover.  I've asked him a few times how much he had to drink or if he's hungover and he says he only had a couple and that he isn't hungover but I really don't believe him. 

His father is an alcoholic and has been my fiance's entire life, and his brother has been battling a fentanyl addiction for a few years now. I am also almost 8 months pregnant with our first child. This behaviour needs to stop and I don't want him to have to learn the hard way and put our baby and me through that.

I just bought some sugar free low cal candies and ice cream but I know they aren’t good for me and cancer runs in my family so I shouldn’t be eating artificial sweeteners.

2020-06-27 16:20:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hh0pp6/has_anyone_here_experienced_psychosis/,Has anyone here experienced psychosis?,"I dont know really where to post.. Im afraid this might be a long post so if you read... I appreciate it. 

Ive been seeing someone for a while now, and im not sure if you guys know anything about cannibis or alcohol induced psychosis or meth.. But he has used all before. Currently he only smokes cigarettes, weed, and drinks beer. I am not a psychologist- but i do work in the medical field and the signs im seeing are pointing directly to psychosis or something along that line.. 

If he drinks or smokes pot.. he becomes so different within a half hour to hour afterwards. he starts thinking that he is dead, he asks me if this is even reality, if we are even here. And then if i say youre not dead, this is reality, he will say “how do you even know?” 

Or he gets paranoid- wont let me touch him because he thinks im going to inject him with something. ?


Theres some things i dont know about his past, but he was in prison for 6 years for grand theft (which he returned the car cause he didnt realize he took the wrong one...thats a whole other story) But his sister has been very vocal saying he has been different and like this since he got out 5 years ago. she does not think this is drugs. 

He has told me some stuff when hes been drinking/smoking but im not completely sure of the whole truth.. He has said things when he gets into these episodes like “i wake up and some dudes on top of me and trying to stick it in me” but he shut down and didnt say anything more. He has said stuff like “well i dont believe counselors are real, maybe some of them, but they just inject you and try to control you” 
sometimes in these episodes he has said “idk what youre gonna do, my privacy has been raped my whole life and who knows im sure ive been injected before” 
or he will just start becoming paranoid about my phone. He doesnt like the camera, so i have tape on my camera on my phone when we drink or if we smoke. I often dont drink with him because he changes so quickly.. i mean 2-3 beers and he is spiralling. He starts taking things apart, he starts destroying the house... nothing he says makes sense. He will start saying random numbers, or just say something weird like “oh yeah i remember nickel” like what?? and ill ask him what he said and he doesnt even know. These episodes havent ever got physical and hes never hurt me. hes raised his voice once and said that i was selling my soul to the devil? And he has hit himself in the face before and called himself a f*ck up. 

I just dont know what im dealing with. I know that he did meth a while ago- but his response to me about it was that he did it and a bunch of bad stuff happened when he did it, and he said he couldnt work and he thought the government was after him, and that he had a really bad experience where he locked himself in the bathroom and took a screw gun and screwed the door shut. (im not sure when this experience/story happened) To my knowledge, he isnt on meth. I mean i see some similarities in these episodes, but if hes not out of my eyesight and i literally watch him change and have these episodes... I mean i dont have an explanation.. I mean theres often times where he grabs my hand and wants me to come pee with him. and other times he is scared of me touching him. And the sex- he is very feely about it. Like he considers it very “special” so in the past few months we have only had sex once, ive given him 2 BJs, and then recently we started having sex and he had been drinking and he stopped right in the middle and put his pants on, grabbed me and said “i wanna make sure we want to have kids first before we keep going..” Which i respect very much-but i keep thinking something is wrong with me where he doesnt find me attractive or something.. like sometimes we have seen each other 3 days in a row without a kiss or even hug because he will say “i dont know you what if you inject me or do something to me” (after hes been drinking and smoking weed)  But he always tells me im so beautiful and how much he likes me, and hes let the word Love slip out a few times. 

I am just at a loss here. Ive mentioned like the psychosis thing and he just jokes about it and says “oh so im in psychosis or im a schizophrenic huh” and then tells me im trippin. Lol 

I mean i know that he has done meth in the past, his old roommate did it and it was a big reason why he kicked him out i guess. But he doesnt talk much about his past with me. Anytime ive brought up the question if he is doing meth or something, he says “you asking me this makes me wanna go do it, that stuff is no good” But its like i know theres 2 people that he is kind of friends with, doesnt see them often but they are meth addicts and his ex girlfriend did meth. He said thats why they arent together- because she needs to be sober. But i dont know how else to explain how he acts.. but its like when would he be doing it? Because if we sit down, open some beers and he is on the couch, hasn’t moved, he was in the car and the store with me when we get beer, and then after a few and few hits of weed he starts spiraling like this? I found one meth pipe when we were cleaning out the house because the back part of the house is kind of destroyed- had to replace the floor and stuff, there was a meth pipe back there and he just shattered it and said “well thats bullshit- i need to get everything in this house cleaned” . Which he kind of has a hoarding issue and he knows he does and so does his family lol— but none of this family seems to have these issues or have ever done drugs- they all seem pretty straight&narrow, all catholic. But yeah..Then like a week later we found like some 14 inch dildo hahaha and he was like “did you put this here??” and it was kind of a joke but then he said “theres so much stuff back there i dont even know about in my house, is this even my house??” 
As far as i know he hasnt used meth since like 3 months ago. He said he tried to do it, and he never wanted to experience it again. So im not sure what to think of that. One time he said something like “i could do dope once a month” and he giggled and im not sure if he was being serious or not. 

But how do i explain these changes that happen? we spend every day together, but we dont always have sleepovers because if he does smoke weed even if he doesnt drink, he gets weird about me being there and doesnt “trust me” enough yet, but he can sleep at my place easily... He sleeps about 5 hours a day. Usually about 1-2hrs hours after he gets off work at 3pm, at my place (my AC works) then he sleeps from about 2am to 6am. 

I just don’t understand how he can be completely normal- drink a few beers and roll a blunt and suddenly he is delusional pretty much. I wanna say its meth- but its just not clicking for me. Especially because its not like he gets weird about the govt or is taking everything apart or anything. He just gets literally delusional- questions life. Will list off a string of numbers randomly. Will say things that dont make any sense and i ask what he is talking about and he doesn’t even know. He will mention a past moment or something, then will go on a rampage about someone hurting his family idk its so confusing.

2020-06-27 02:53:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hgoruk/that_feeling_when/,That feeling when...,"You've been sick for days. Dry heaving when you brush your teeth in the morning. Muscles ache, bones throb, nerves on fire, limbs kicking; the pain and restlessness seem unreal. If lucky, you're sleeping for 15 minutes at a time in a drenched bed sheet that isn't going to get washed anytime soon.  You wake up from your 3rd wet dream of the week, only to be bombarded with instant anxiety and the realization that your in hell on earth. Time moves so slow. Nothing is interesting. Even watching YouTube feels like a chore. Conversations feel so awkward, and all you want to be is alone, yet you crave attachment. Even your dog can tell something is wrong and wishes you had the energy to love. Most likely you haven't had a gf/bf for an embarrassing amount of time. Nothing matters. Life seems dull and grey. And the only remedy is what got you here in the first place.  

You somehow power through the days. Physically you feel a little better, but mentally still falling in an abyss. When will you reach the ocean floor? Your missed calls/texts are adding up, yet still no desire to enter back in reality. You tell loved ones you have the flu... The 4th time this year. They know whats up. But you don't have the energy to come clean and validate their disappointment.  But you keep pushing through. You lay in bed, catching yourself praying to a God that you don't even believe in. You are so close to relapse because there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. Life seems so dark. Will you ever feel normal again? 

You wake up to the birds chirping, glance at your phone, and surprised it's 7am. You finally take a dump that has an actual shape. Somehow you're able to eat a bowl of cereal. You hop in the shower and stand the entire time, instead of periodically sitting like a school kid as the water temporary cleanses your soul like a baptism.  As you're drying off, the shivering shakes aren't as prevalent. You find the energy to go to the store. When you approach the cashier, you make friendly eye contact and surprisingly it doesn't feel like she stared through your soul. The small talk doesn't seem as forced and your brain reacts a little faster. Possibly even make a corny joke that gets a smile. As you walk back to your car, you notice you're walking a little faster. Muscles aren't aching as bad. Lower back not tied in a knot. The sky looks bluer and the trees a little greener. The gentle breeze dries the sweat off your back, and for once you're content with your body temperature. 

THAT FEELING WHEN the sun shines down on your pale face.. You look up and smile for the first time in a week+. You begin to float up from the ocean floor; equilibrium is in motion, and that radiant light at the end of the tunnel is now visible. The hard part is over, yet deep down you know it has just begun. But for the time being you have hope. That smile on your face is worth more than money can buy and perhaps your bank account has seen the last of overdraft days. As you drive down the road, with windows down, a nostalgic song comes on the radio, and it's like you've heard music for the first time..

That feeling when you are finally recovering from opiate withdrawal..

[Video Games addiction],"I am talking about the ""Dopamine Exhaustion Reset"", which is about 3 weeks to 2 months in. I am wondering, does dopamine ""care"" about the source of the dopamine release in relation to the process of the reset? I need to ideally take a 2 month break from video gaming, but will the reset occur just by avoiding video games or do I have to completely remove any dopamine release source from my life for that period of 3 weeks to 2 months?  I'll give an example: I stop playing video games completely, but I binge watch YouTube videos, Twitch gamer streamers, Netflix, Facebook & Instagram scrolling and binge snacking as a natural way to kind of replace the video gaming, does that decrease or even stop the dopamine exhaustion reset? In that case, quitting video games alone will not suffice and will require a full 3 week - 2 months period of dopamine reset from ALL or MOST sources. Am I correct? And if that is the case, what is there to do, really? Everyone is at home glued to their screen and I am left to what? Walk in the park for 12 hours?

Or should I do gradual abstinence? Like stop video gaming and watch movies for a few months, then quit movies/videos all the time and make it 50/50 with reading and so on until my dopamine exhaustion is reset but gradually? Because I don't think I can handle full 24/7 reality stream, it's so boring that I would want to die.

Hi, first post on my alt account but it’s after 5am and I can’t sleep and I have way too much on my mind. 

I honestly have no idea what to think about what’s going on with me and I need to vent. 

I’m 22, I’ve never been diagnosed with ADHD, although I feel like it is a possibility for me. I have a lot of trouble with motivation and functioning in my day to day life. I have depression (taking wellbutrin for that and it’s not really working) and a history of an eating disorder. I’m also genetically predisposed to addiction. 

In early April I bought some adderall for the first time to help with studying. I took 15mg the first night and it introduced me to a brand new world. I was suddenly able to socialize (I have bad social anxiety), and I felt more motivated than ever. I wanted to do things for the first time in a while. I felt like I was accessing so much more of my brain capacity and everything was so clear to me. 

Since that night, I’ve been taking adderall almost every single day for the past 3 months. I started with only 7.5 mg for a week or so but moved up to 15 mg every day besides Saturday and sunday (mostly). When school got harder I’d take more and stay up for a couple days a week to work (but I also loved the thrill of it). In early May I started snorting it, probably 2-3 times a week if I felt like shit and needed energy or motivation fast. I’ll do a couple bumps of adderall when I drink heavily, and I also do coke or ketamine on rare occasions (the binge drinking hasn’t been as regular bc of covid). 

The thing is that I don’t take it just for school, and actually found that i’d rather be doing anything else besides homework when i’m on adderall, so my grades never benefitted. I keep taking adderall because it makes me feel amazing and it alleviates my depression.

The problem is now, without adderall i’m a zombie. I get intense anxiety when it wears off and I picked up the habit of drinking every night to deal with it. I would say I need it to feel normal but idk what normal really is for me because I’m so low energy and depressed naturally. I just know I feel like shit without it and at this point I rely on it to do anything (cleaning, homework). 

I was off of it for a week because I felt guilty and told my boyfriend but I had a lot of mental cravings during that time. He thinks it’s an issue. After a week I caved and bought more and I am hiding the fact that I’m taking it from my bf. 
On top of that, I am still not recovered fully from my eating disorder so a part of me loves the side affects of having no appetite, and I generally rely on self destructiveness to cope with life. 


I guess my big issue is I feel like I don’t take nearly enough adderall to actually have a valid problem. If I was diagnosed with ADHD I would just be taking a low dosage for a normal patient. I’m tempted to talk to a doctor about actually getting a script but I’m worried they won’t let me near it because of my medical record of an ED. Sometimes I feel like what i’m doing is wrong and I don’t like the cycle it’s put me in, but my mind also says that the only difference between my usage and a normal healthy prescription is that I’m not prescribed it. When I see it this way, I don’t think I have a problem at all and It’s embarrassing that I would consider this habit a big deal.




At this point it’s either I see a therapist for substance abuse or a doctor for an ADHD diagnoses because I can’t afford this habit illegally. Please tell me if I’m wrong, I really need an outside opinion.",3,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9648013114929199}"

He has been using speed and various other drugs since before we met. He has stopped all the other miscellaneous drugs and only really ever does speed. He was highly invested in speed when we first started dating (I didn't know at the time) and stopped for almost a year after an intense car accident involving a transport (not at fault, just scary). He has started to use occasionally again whenever the opportunity presents itself (i.e., someone he knows and is around during the day has some extra pills he can buy). 

I want him to stop.

My predicament is, I have been told by him that he feels like he's always in trouble (for other unrelated but maybe related relationship issues we have). He's not always in trouble. He just hurt me pretty badly and sometimes that hurt surfaces when I encounter reminders.

He has enough respect and trust for me right now that he tells me when he takes pills. **Every time**. I have become hyper aware of the way he behaves sober (simple things like actually sleeps, normal appetite after work, no erectile issues and generally normal sex drive and even tends to be slightly grumpier) and the way he behaves on speed (up all night, intense heart beat, sweaty as fuck, hyper and talkative, and incredibly horny but struggles A LOT to get or maintain an erection) so I know he's being honest. I don't want to break that trust or make him want to hide it from me by getting angry about it. But I REALLY want to tell him it is not ok in my world. 

Any suggestions on how?

I asked him a few weeks ago to say no to his source when his source offered. Told him I loved him and that I thought his body needed a break. I told him I don't like it.

I fell in love with a women who was like looking in the mirror; that comes with good and the bad. I accepted it all. We initially got together partied hard and wanted to OD on heroin together, having never done it but both wanting to end it all. One night after everything was secured, we had a big brain moment and wondered how it would be for one another if only one of us died, we promised to be there for one another and to do away with the sacrificial mindsets.

Fast forward 2 years. She is still in college joined a sorority, zooming through classes. I am home due to mental health sleeping on my moms couch trying to piece it all together. Things went toxic between us at times between the two of our chemical imbalances. She had PMDD and I was manic bipolar type 2. I still loved her through it all I had faith we could make it through the hard times. Well, her promise didn’t quite hold the same, she broke up with me on my birthday.

Before then I had dabbled in Xanax recreationally, but never to cover any hurt per se. But I then found myself wanting to end it all, ruin my life and not look back. Every promise I made to the person I loved with everything I had meant nothing. It’s been a year since then and I have kept my life together only taking 5 or so xans every 2/3 months, which I mix with tons of alcohol, a light bender of sorts. I know it’s not ideal but it help me get by. It’s been a year since she broke up with me and she has come back saying how she has changed and still loves me, just she has personal work to do. My trust and worth are obliterated. My sex and date life is alive however it’s a front to mull over my pain. I think of her day and night. This morning I woke up from another odd dream involving her. I hit my plug for 50 xannax. I don’t think I’ll do anything crazy, but I just wanted to vent, I know it’s 10x the amount I normally buy and know the risks.

2020-06-24 14:58:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hf70x4/not_sure_where_to_turn/,Not sure where to turn,"So I’ve gone through true addiction two times in my life. Previously with alcohol and weed separately both over two years ago now. Ever since I’ve been off and on doing some drugs here and there and it was all social for parties and events. I’ve dealt with months of anxiety depression insomnia the works. 

Three weeks ago I bought a 99% hybrid cart to get me through a road trip which was the first time in over a year that I purchased anything for myself. The idea was to just use it on the road trip and when I was done I would just put it somewhere in my room and forget about it. It wasn’t until a whole week after the road trip that I realized I was using that cart every single night and getting stoned every night. Once the cart ran dry I knew I’d have really anxious insomnia which given my past issues exponentiates my anxiety when I know I’m feeling withdrawal. 

So preemptively i went and stocked up on some nice Hennessy and Bombay Saphire to ease myself into sleep. I only drink like once every few months on occasion. I ended up getting drunk the first night, tipsy the second, and drunk again the third and fourth. Not even because I felt anxious but because I knew I probably would. 

Then two nights ago, I had a bonfire I had with all my friends for my birthday and ended up doing caffeine, nicotine, Molly, weed, Xanax, and alcohol all through one night in about six hours. 

So yesterday for the better part of the day I didn’t really feel any anxiety or anything but mostly because the Xanax alcohol and weed were still affecting me a bit. Then as it got night I started to feel a little down and needed a boost so I bought two puff plus. (Which with my low tolerance makes me barely able to walk after like five hits) I didn’t even realize I kept having session after session with it until it was like 8:00 pm.

Once the head rush wore off I was left with this restless feeling of anxiousness and negativity. The Molly comedown from the night before made me not really want to engage in any serotonin related activities, and the anxiety made actively doing anything feel like a huge chore and I just wasn’t satisfied with anything that I could do. 

It came about time to start preparing for sleep time and had initially thought I could be able to sleep alright because of the residual Xanax, that’s usually how it works for me, but I didn’t even really wana lay in bed at all I wanted to sit up and practice piano or guitar even tho I wasn’t even enjoying that either. 

Finally I had had enough. I remembered that I had two bars of Xanax I had as emergency trip killers and since I’m definitely not in the mindset to do a psych at the moment I took a full bar thinking for sure this will put me on my ass. I started to feel a little calmer and calmer as as hour passed and finally for a little bit maybe around a period of half an hour I was vibing pretty hard and started to feel more okay. Watching music videos and texting friends I was thinking everything was going to be okay until I realized I was still way too energetic to sleep. Then I got this weird headache I don’t quite remember what part of the head I felt it in and it was tolerable but still pretty uncomfortable. (And it wasn’t a serotonin deficit headache I’ve had those too) 

So I figured the only thing left to try was to take the second bar of Xanax. 20 mins after I took it I did start to feel a little calmer but I went through a whole mental thing of feeling really bad for myself and worrying about how I’m going to get myself out of this mess without insomnia and anxiety for three straight weeks. 

Eventually I fell asleep only to have five different dreams where in each dream I was convinced it was reality and every plot was the same where basically it was normal life but then out of nowhere I would start tripping and I knew I had taken the Xanax be Ayse I thought it was real life, and then started hallucinating and thinking I was overdosing on the Xanax. 

After the fifth dream I woke up and told myself over and over again that the Xanax didn’t hit hard like that and that it was just dreams. I fell back asleep and woke up the next morning having not had another dream. So far I’m having a good morning and I feel fine but I know tonight I’ll be in the same boat. All I have is a little bit of alcohol left and I really don’t feel like drinking it but I know that if I can’t sleep by 2 am again I’ll end up having to. 

Anyway if you made it this far and have some advice to share please do. I’m a pretty logic oriented person and would prefer things that are scientifically backed to feel the most clarity. Nonetheless though anything helps. I work out daily and meditate too. My diet is consistent and good as well as good amounts of water. I’ll probably be looking back at this post a month from now like damn I was a pussy but the human psyche is the most important part of life so I really take this stuff seriously.

But it's REALLY hard for me to physically eat. Like super hard. It takes me 30 minutes to eat a small snack. I keep making excuses to not eat and the hunger signals I do feel give me a sense of self confidence and ""pleasure"" even though I know it's wrong.. I'm also eating the same exact foods and meals whenever I do eat. I eat about 1200 to 1400 calories a day rn so not extreme like the 500 I did or nothing in the depths of my anorexia.

The drugs helped me escape the wraiths of my ed and not care about food or my body weight.. drugs helped me become weight restored.

So, he stayed in my guest bedroom this past weekend so he could spend time with my daughter for Father’s Day. Anywho, Sunday night I took him back home. Monday, my daughter goes into the guest room he was staying in and found a tray with pieces of a broken light bulb. It appears as though pliers were used to pry open the metal part and looks as though there is a mustard yellow residue on the other end of the metal piece (the metal piece is the part that screws into the lamp). This lightbulb was taken from the ceiling fan in the room he was staying in. I need advice identifying this so I can ensure the best path forward for my daughter and I.

I’m an 18yo black female from the US. I’ve been somewhat knowledgable on my religion my whole life but never got serious about it until I was 16. When I was 16, I had been seeing a guy who is my ex friend’s older brother. He groomed me and made it seem like he wanted a relationship with me and one time he had sex with me when I ever verbalised the word “yes”. I bled like hell and after having sex with him a few more times I didn’t do it for a year

About a year later I’ve gotten into college and I’m spending the rest of my senior year of hs kinda frivolously since my AP tests were done. I start doing a bunch of folks - by the time school is over I’ve had sex with 5 guys total. The 5th guy was a friend I had known for 3 years - even though we had used w condom and I was on BC (the shot), I had gotten pregnant. I didn’t want to have an abortion but I decided to because my friend threatened suicide if I didn’t and we both wanted to go to college. I still loved that child and an abortion was the last thing I wanted, but I loved my friend too and I knew he was serious about hurting himself; he had attempted suicide 3x in the past

Freshman year was okay. Lots of new friends and I did well in classes. However, I had lost that baby and my best friend, and I was just fucking to fill the void. So by second semester (January) I had done around 13 guys. As of now, it’s been 19. I don’t even orgasm every time, but sex makes me feel more comforted. I feel relaxed and at peace, when I’m not having sex I never feel that way. I have severe anxiety depression and ptsd, all diagnosed. But I can’t get medication bc I’m an ROTC cadet. Sex helps me and I don’t know what else I can do

I’m currently a reform Jew but I’m tryna convert to orthodox by January. Orthodox Judaism strictly forbids relations outside of marriage and I want to be as observant as I possibly can. However, if I stop having sex, I don’t know how I will be able to cope with all the stressors I have. It is truly horrible and unimaginable the horrors I endure on the inside every single day and it only keeps getting worse. I lost my teen years to mental illness. Tried for a drivers license, never got it because I never finished up. Now I have to get one in the state where my college is. Never had a serious boyfriend. All my friends from HS I don’t fw no more. I have nothing going for me except my looks and I’ve never felt more shitty in life than I do now

My current FWB is a conservative Jew and a friend of mine I’ve known for a while. He’s cute and I definitely like having sex with him and I don’t wanna stop. I mean he’s like, 6’5 and his dick is huge. However I don’t know how to stop. Sex is the only way I feel like my existence can be validated. My existence feels like a stain on the earth that you can’t wash out and I feel like my only purpose is to be a living fleshlight

I am trying my best to think more positively and I am literally drowning myself in religious texts and prayer. I know that God will be able to deliver me from all the sins I have been committing and I know He wants the best for me. But I gotta want the best for me too.

2020-06-22 18:42:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/he2k9n/eleven_questions/,Eleven Questions,"Dr. Lance Dodes's book ***The Heart of Addiction**: A New Approach to Understanding and Managing Alcoholism and Other Addictive Behaviors* was a milestone on the developmental path of both understanding and addressing both substance *and* behavioral addictions when it was published in 2002. Dodes had studied Edward Khantzian's [self-medication hypothesis](https://www.google.com/search?q=Edward+Khantzian+self-medication&oq=Edward+Khantzian+self-medication&aqs=chrome..69i57.11497j0j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) as well as Howard Shaffer's early work on the syndrome model of addiction. (See [A Basic Addiction References List]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ResponsibleRecovery/comments/e078lr/an_addiction_references_list/).) 

Dodes was the first author I know of who carted that data off into the pop psych world, and his book *was* a best-seller. And even though it includes information that has since been refuted by formal research -- including what is now widely seen as an irresponsibly totalistic dismissal of the [12 Step approach](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=12+step+recovery+programs+list) to addiction treatment that continues to [show its effectiveness](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/11/alcoholics-anonymous-aa-helps-people-stay-sober-longer-study-finds/5008835002/) -- it's still useful if one can get out of their own totalistic, polarized [dichotomizing](https://www.google.com/search?q=dichotomy&oq=dicho&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.6477j1j8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) (either/or, this-or-that) and into the more [dialectical](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811254/) (some-of-this-*and*-some-of-that) view that has been the standard of modern psychotherapy since Marsha Linehan developed [DBT](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=dialectical+behavior+therapy) even *before* Dodes wrote his book. 

(DBT, btw, remains a [""gold standard"" treatment modality](https://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2019/12/gold-standard-addiction-treatment.html) for almost every form of behaviorally conditioned -- as opposed to biogenetic or physically induced -- mental illness known to man, including addiction. Because it treats the same *causes* of addictive behaviors Dodes described in his book, is *really* thorough and *really* effective, but it *is* expensive if one does it in Marsha's ""classic"" manner. Fortunately, there are at least somewhat viable alternatives to that nowadays.)

In whatever event, Dodes came up with ten questions to assist in the professional diagnosis, ""[motivational enhancement](https://www.google.com/search?client=avg&q=motivational+enhancement+therapy)"" *and* self-acceptance thereof of alcoholism, which I have adapted here to deal with all forms of obsessive-compulsive ""acting out,"" and one of which I split in two because it works better that way. So here's the list of eleven for anyone and everyone to consider relative to whatever it is they do that may or may not qualify as an ""addiction.""

**If you're wondering whether or not you are an addict**, asking yourself the eleven questions may be helpful.

1) Do I act out when I really don’t want to, but believe I have to do *something*, and there seems to be nothing else I can do to relieve my tension?

2) Even if I like acting out, is there a sort of “grim determination” to it that cannot be explained by liking it?

3) If I am prevented from acting out in any way, do I become frustrated and rageful?

4) Do I feel better knowing I am *going* to act out before I do so?

5) Are there specific situations that I pretty much *know* will lead to acting out?

6) Are there certain emotions I feel -- like grief, sadness, anger, helplessness -- that usually lead to acting out?

7) If I cannot act out the way I want to, do I usually substitute another way of acting out?

8) Is acting out a substitute for a relationship with a specific person?

9) Do I act out when I feel guilty, shameful, remorseful, regretful, anxious or worried?

10) Does acting out seem to solve emotional problems for a while?

11) Does acting out help me feel more in control of my life and/or feelings for a while?",2,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9856672883033752}"
2020-06-22 16:30:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/he06e5/has_anybody_successfully_overcome_their_fentanyl/,Has anybody successfully overcome their fentanyl addiction?,"I have been abusing fentanyl for 7 years, no big breaks, never finished a single withdrawal attempt.

I don't want this life at all. I want to be able to work, I want to do so many things one can't while addicted. And I don't want to depend on abusive people anymore.

And yes, people talk about willpower and stuff, but I can't make it click in my head. All I know is that in my experience, withdrawal is absolute hell and I wouldn't wish it on anybody. I can't see myself ever going though with it. If I had the money I would pay for somebody to knock me unconscious each time I wake up or something. Having to be any level of conscious during withdrawal is inhumane imo, even if medication is given to weaken the symptoms.
The only alternative I can even envision to my current life would be death. But there must be another way..

I've never been less in control of myself and what I do or want than during withdrawal. I know I can be super motivated right now and 100% sure I can make it, but once it starts I will do anything to make it stop.

I have hoarded some tramadol as a weaker opioid option and I have Lyrica (pregabaline), which is really helpful. It lessens the symptoms significantly, more than any other non-opioid in my experience. But it has an equally horrible potential for physical dependency.

So my plan is to somehow get through with this, without ending up addicted to Lyrica. (Maybe no longer than 2 weeks max if using it(?))
I'd be happy to get down to the ""tramadol-level"" and maybe stay there for a while to recharge before quitting completely. It's much easier to get and should be easier to withdraw from later on(?). (But I know its a very individual experience, some people say tramadol withdrawals are worse than fentanyl..)
I'd also have the option to join a substitution program with methadone and start living my life and skip the biggest chunk of the withdrawal process. Or join the program to slowly get to the lowest possible dosage and then quit. but I know myself.. I would get stuck and never leave the program. And for what I want to do with my life I'd have to be fully sober and in no program one day. (Eg. driving license, be able to travel, be *free*)

Basically I just want to hear your guy's (success) stories or any experiences related to fentanyl or opioid withdrawal.
Did you ever get to the point where all withdrawal symptoms subsided and you felt normal again? How did you do it and how long did it take? (People say 2-5 weeks (cold turkey fentanyl) but I'd imagine the 2-12 months afterwards to be not so pleasant as well?)
Is it worth it to maybe join a methadone program and slowly cut down on the dosage before quitting completely?

Also, do you guys have any advice or tricks on using pregabaline for help without developing physical dependency? Or would you not recommend?

PS: A little rant about detox clinics:

I had so much hope for the clinic the first time. You'd think in a proper environment with professionals to help you, it all feels less lonely, dangerous and hopeless. But going to a clinic for detox has been a disaster for me in the past. I think the way they're set up is outdated and counterproductive.
The regular old detox clinic makes things more unbearable by taking away normal things and the one thing you're there for, medication to aid the withdrawal, are held back from you until you get seizures/nearly die.
I can medicate myself less strictly and thus more effectively at home and I don't want to share a room while shitting my pants and puking everywhere. I don't see the point in allowing no phone or TV, which might help take the mind off the suffering.
One could really use single therapy sessions, just someone to talk to when you are the most emotional and fragile. But the detox clinics I were at don't offer that. (Instead group ""therapy"" to talk about who is next cleaning the toilets. Who on earth is even physically able to clean a toilet while in acute opioid withdrawal?)
The point of a detox clinic sould be to get somebody off of opiods with as little suffering as possible, not to punish and discipline them, there is enough time for that later on in the stationary therapy, once you're through the detox phase.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9857172966003418}"

They confessed about 6 months in to the relationship that they take Suboxone due to a Percocet addiction from a decade before.  My partner claimed that everything was under control and it is just a precaution to stay off of Opioids.  I have no experience with Opioids and took them for their word.

2020-06-22 10:46:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hdtngl/do_the_lives_of_addicts_matter/,Do the lives of addicts matter?,"Ignore the title, and what it may call to mind. I guess I shouldn’t have chosen that phrasing. Anyways, it is a provocative question, so I am being provocative, and reading it has probably made you uncomfortable. You want to reflexively answer in the affirmative, but there is a whisper in your ear that won’t go away: maybe their lives, don’t, in fact, matter. Maybe they deserve whatever suffering comes their way.  Maybe the world would be better without them. 

I will grant you that last one, in that the world would in fact be a much better place if addiction, and addicts, didn’t exist. But they do. The various realities of biology, pharmacology, and simple, basic human nature have always, and will always, conspire to make addicts out of a significant proportion of all human beings. The consequences are tragic, and our general reaction, as a culture, to these consequences: also tragic. 

We generally treat addiction as a monstrous character flaw, and addicts as untouchables. But addiction is not classified as a personality disorder (notwithstanding the fact that one should also be able to have compassion for those unfortunate enough to afflicted with one) - it is a mental illness. The brain is, ultimately, a very sophisticated piece of meat, and having a thinking brain is not analogous to being a little homunculus driving a body - our brains are susceptible to unasked-for illnesses in the same way that our bodies are. The question of whether we truly have free will in the first place is one for people much smarter than me to debate, but no one can deny that given the uncountable number of variables and processes that go into making a mind, we are not as in control as we like to think we are. I like the analogy of a brain tumor. If someone were to develop a mass in a certain area of the brain, and their behavior began to change dramatically - to the point that they were essentially a different person - wouldn’t they be a victim deserving of compassion? They might become impossible to live with and hard to understand, but they didn’t choose to become that way. So, when basically the same thing happens to people suffering from a mental illness, through more mysterious  but no less physically real processes taking place in the brain - why do we react differently? 

So, if you can accept the fact that addicts are in fact suffering from a mental illness (one among many, as is most often the case), and that they are not simply people who have thrown caution to the wind and decided to yolo with the best of them, what does that mean for how we treat them? Haven’t we decided that it’s monstrous to see someone in pain because of an illness  and to ignore them? Wouldn’t it become monstrous to see someone suffering from some invisible compulsion - something that if they could only find the off switch for, something that makes them crave a time machine -  to see them and to ignore them? Wouldn’t it be be wrong to decide that whatever dreams they may have had, whoever they may have been before or may yet become - that these things don’t matter anymore because they chose their lot? 

This isn’t just a problem when it comes to addiction. It applies more or less to all mental illnesses, in that even though science has been telling us for decades that these things are in fact illnesses, we can’t resist assigning some value judgement to those afflicted. In a way, I think it’s a protective mechanism, because if you believe that mental illnesses only happen to those deserving of them, you can convince yourself you’ll never get one. That’s understandable, if misguided. What isn’t understandable is that, even in this age of supposed mental health awareness and supposed compassion for those suffering, I, and many others, still feel ashamed and terrified about how others might react. And rightly so. I still catch myself judging people who seem really down and out, even though I know better, so I can only imagine what other people must think. The culture is saturated with the idea that people suffering from mental illnesses, and especially addiction, are dangerous - that they are bad, irredeemable villains who are just reaping what they sowed. 

And sure, some are dangerous. And some are a drain on finances and emotions.  I was never quite dangerous myself, but I became preternaturally manipulative and I hated every second of it. But that is the nature of this illness, and we seem to be able to tolerate the bad things that come with the physical ones, and mercifully, some of the more palatable mental ones, because we recognize that no one chooses to become ill. 


Deaths resulting from self harm and substance abuse are the two top causes of death for 15-49 year olds in the U.S. One in four of all deaths are ultimately attributable to alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. So, did these lives matter? We certainly don’t act like it. And who is the monster - the person suffering, or the society casting them out?",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.8803516030311584}"

2020-06-21 18:33:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hdg1gj/what_addiction_led_to_and_my_tentative_recovery/,"What addiction led to, and my tentative recovery. So it goes (not yet!)","
I pushed a finger into my leg. It gave, and then the little pocket that formed didn’t rebound like usual. It looked like when you make a little pocket in fresh dough. I had read about this before. It meant something very bad. 

The reason I knew this was because I had been habitually doing this “push test” whenever I felt really off, and as it happens, one tends to feel off quite a lot when indulging in speedballs. So it came to pass that one day, while feeling so off I could barely lift my arms, I failed the push test. 

I had just crashed my car, and instead of calling for help, I frantically worked to change my tire, as my car was the only way to Baltimore, the land of heroin and cocaine. This was usually a simple task for me. Loosen the lug nuts, jack the car up, finish loosening the lug nuts, switch to the spare, and tighten. Instead, I managed to loosen exactly one before collapsing next to the car. A passerby offered help, and on second glance decided against it. Can’t say I blame her. I looked like a zombie, as the officer I spoke to later that night told me. 

I gathered my strength and forged ahead. I may have been about to die, but goddamnit, I was gonna get high first. 

I couldn’t exactly accomplish this task myself, although, let me tell you, dear reader, I tried. A small piece of advice to any enterprising idiots out there - if you are so sick that you literally can’t lift your arms above shoulder height without wincing, you should not try to change a tire. Suffice it to say, I crushed the jack, and nearly my arm with it, under the weight of the car. So I called a tow truck, and the driver told me that because of the strange incline my car was on and the mechanics of his jack, he could only lift it from the middle, which might irreparably bend the frame. Was this a choice to be thoughtfully considered, weighing the potential of a future catastrophe against my immediate needs? Of course not.  Fuck it, I told him. Do it. 

It was while I was waiting for him to change the tire that I absentmindedly pushed a finger into my arm. It was clear to me that the moment of reckoning, that I had always known, but never really believed, would come, had finally arrived. Years of being in the grips of competing mental illnesses had finally culminated in what I would soon find out was a life threatening infection - endocarditis. 

Anyways. On the move again. My dealer is blowing up my phone - *where the fuck are you? * This was my priority. 

So, naturally, I ignore the fact that I’m driving on an old spare, and that I keep almost passing out because, as I will later find out, my blood pressure is dangerously, life threateningly low, and my pulse is just-ran-a-marathon high -  I drive as fast as I possibly can. 

So, I get there, and of course, I nearly pop the spare on the way, putting a huge bubble in it. After my dealer yells at me for trying to shoot up a good 10 feet from where I just saw him, and having driven to a slightly more secluded, but no less sketchy little spot, I find that I’m in even worse shape. Whereas before I could still manage to, painfully, get my arms above my head, I find that now I can barely maneuver into the position necessary to hit my preferred vein (the brachial in my left upper arm, for any of you who have studied one too many vein charts). Did I take this as a sign that maybe I should give it up and call for help? 

If you’ve come with me this far, dear reader, you know the answer to that question.

It’s at this point that my memory is very hazy. I know that I ended up in a shopping center, and I know that I kept nodding out onto the dashboard, and I know that a friendly lady, probably too friendly for my own good, came and warned me that some “nosy bitch” had just called the cops on me. I decided that the best course of action was not to drive away, not out of any concern for the consequences of driving in that state but because I was too incapacitated to think straight. I decided to to get out of the car and pretend I was inspecting my spare. 

So, the officer arrived, and, god bless my white skin and sometimes pleasant demeanor, I wasn’t immediately arrested and roughed up and put in jail, because I surely would have died there. 
Instead of arresting me, as she probably would have been justified in doing, she tried to help me with the mostly nonexistent tire situation, and told me that she really recommended I seek medical care, even if she didn’t know quite what was wrong. I gave implausible, but somehow passable, answers to her questions about why I was in the area if not for drugs, and she warned me that if I drove away, she or her friends would find me, and she let me be. 

I chugged a few gatorades for strength and got on my way. 

The next day, I could hardly walk. I needed to be helped out of bed, and pushed up the stairs. I was dying.

In the hospital, they discovered MRSA in my blood, and in my heart, a one inch hole. Non-invasive treatments weren’t working, so I needed open heart surgery, and then several months IV of antibiotics to stave off the infection. I had to learn how to walk again - I was so weak from the illness and the surgery that I couldn’t sit up in bed without panting, much less make it onto my feet. 

I’m a year sober now. 



(Also, I want to make it clear that this is not a “war story.” I DO NOT think this shit was cool, or funny, or romantic, or whatever. I consider it a story of severe mental illness, which is what addiction is, and writing about it helps me process it.

I was severely triggered today after my brother with CHF told me he wants to host a party with 10+ people outside. Since this is my mom's home, he asked her. She's fine with it, and it infuriates me because I feel she doesnt care about his health, and I feel I'm the only one that feels this is risky and unsafe during the pandemic to be hosting such a party.

My brother has an eating disorder and is severely overweight which worsens his CHF + Gout. My mom always buys him food that raises his salt levels (which is highly dangerous and has lead him to be in the hospital numerous times with some close calls), as well as foods that trigger his gout, and I feel like NO ONE cares about him, not even himself. My brother is 26, I know hes an adult, I am just so frustrated and hurt that I am always the one to be told I'm overreacting if I disagree or get upset.

I have a great job, insurance, brand new car.. ect.. luckily I havent gotten to crazy compared to 4 years ago.. when I was homeless strung out on heroin and meth.. homeless living in a damn tent.. not the best time of my life.. that's why it makes me so mad that I relapsed after experiencing all that.. but I know why it happened, won't get into all that. At least I learned to quit while I'm ahead! Lol.. anyways! Now on to the question. I'm doing a medicated treatment to quit.. basically they gave me Suboxone strips, along with clonidine, tizanidine, hydroxyzine, gabapentin, ibuprofen, ondansetron.. 

I've always quit cold turkey and never had any of this type of stuff to help.. ive heard they help alot so that is nice.. basically my question is I've seen that people will take morphine for example, for like the first day or maybe second day.. ( the drug of choice in that example is fent) and then they go to 2 or 3 days of the strip and then they are done and good from the kick.. is this true? If so is it beneficial to take something like morphine or something else similar? I didn't quite understand why people were doing that for only like a day?.. 
Basically I don't want to start subs.. my doctor for them wants me to do them for a year.. was saying oh some people do it for life.. tried to compare it with someone who is diabetic and how they have to take insulin, he tried to say that is like your insulin.. lol
I'm like fuck that.. for a 3 month hic up.. I ain't about to start taking subs everyday.. I know what I did wrong.. and I will adjust accordingly. 
I guess if you have any tips about that question above or about what I'm going to do In general, that would be awesome! I honestly don't even want to use the subs at all.. I'm going to try to just do it with the meds I told you about above.. get through the 3 to 4 days and move on.. 
Sorry if it was a bit long and a bit of a rant lol.. hopefully it generally makes sense and hopefully I can get some good answer/tips! Thanks for reading!",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981783628463745}"

Opioids really do help get that all is good feeling, even if everything around you is falling to pieces. 

So, a few days ago I stopped cold turkey. This was in the contingency. I said to myself, if I am slipping, it's gonna be short. So, I mentally prepared. 

Day 3, I am still recovering. I have a pre-existing condition, for which I originally started opioids, that just makes abstinence much worse. 

Day one I was vomiting like crazy. Day two, I felt like a floating nothingness, and now I am slowly starting to get back to feeling like a human being. 

I am not super worried, I will relapse back, unless another tragedy happens. Which... is likely, considering how the world is lately. I am directly affected by the border closing, and my destiny and safety is directly linked to it. So, a loooooot of pressure.

I need your help. I don't know what to do anymore.

I think I'm going to lose my best friend and I'm so fucking scared.

I met her like 3 years ago as she was one of my buddies girlfriend's, and at some point we became super close friends. She's been going through a ton, she experienced a lot of trauma when she was younger, as well as when she went to a college about 45 minutes away from where we leave.

When we went there she ended up getting into hard drugs, pretty much absolutely anything she could get her hands on or was given. Her favorites which she has had issues with for a long time are meth and heroin, heroin being her absolute favorite (as well as fentanyl and any other opiates she can get)

I've been trying to help her since we started to become close. I studied a lot about mental health and drugs in school and on my own (I'm 19 she's 20 btw) and of course I don't know much at all, but I was able to help her some. We were able to determine she has bipolar disorder which she ended up being diagnosed with when she finally went to a psychiatrist, and got some meds however they never really helped her that much, however she also has been bad at taking them consistently which I know is super important.

I've also been trying to help her get clean. It's super hard as I'm a drug user too and we do still use stuff together, I used to smoke weed 24/7 however on 4/20 we both decided to quit our DOCs, for her meth and opiates, and weed for me. Since then we've used K together, alcohol while not a lot as she's been on the vivetrol shot this month so she can't really drink, as well as Adderall which she is prescribed.

I've tried going to NA meetings with her, had her go to a very short time rehabilitation facility (she was in for 3 days) after she overdosed on fent and alcohol at my house and I had to narcan her, I've tried having her go to a therapist which she still does but she has a super hard time opening up and being honest about everything she's dealt with, as well as just trying to talk to her, however it just hasn't done much for her.

The big issue is that she's super suicidal. She wasn't taking her bipolar meds for a while which lead her to going into an incredibly bad depressive episode. I had begged her to come by my house and talk to me before she ever decides to kill herself, and one day she came by and was incredibly suicidal, and was planning on ending it that day. Luckily she ended up staying with me, and ended up staying at my house for around 2 weeks or so, where I used a pair of handcuffs we bought at night so she couldn't go kill herself or buy H as night times are the worst for her (this is of course something she consents to).

We changed her meds, and I tried to do whatever I can to help, she is trying to set up Ketamine therapy right now, as that is supposed to be effective for both bipolar 1 as well as depression, however things just don't seem to be getting better.

We are hanging out today, she's here now, sleeping or at least laying down, and earlier when we were talking about difficult stuff, she said that she is looking forward to when she can get high again, as she can't now because of the vivetrol shot. This really broke my heart. She says she will be okay, that she will still be here when I get back (I have to leave the country for a few months on the 15th of July and I'm SO scared she is going to die while I'm gone) however with drug use it's just not something you can control. At some point she might shoot to heavy, mix stuff she shouldn't, get a bag that has a little more fentanyl in it than she expects as she doesn't mind using H with fent in it, and then it's all over. And if I can't be here to watch her and narcan her if things go bad, then I'm going to lose her.

At this point I just don't even know what to do anymore. She doesn't want her mom to know at all, even though she would pay for any rehab or treatment needed, she is so scared of her mom knowing and has told me multiple times if she gets sent to rehab or if her mom finds out her life is over and she is going to kill herself.

I don't know what to do, rehab doesn't seem an option, I can't tell her mom to try and get someone else to be able to assist who has money and can take action, she won't continue to get the vivetrol shot, there doesn't seem like anything is possible.

And I understand, for someone to get better they have to want to, it has to be there choice, it has to be their own path, but I don't want to lose my best friend. I've never met someone I can have as good of conversation with, who gets me, who thinks like me, who understands how I am and who I understand. I don't want to lose her, she's my best friend, she's so important to me, and I don't want to lose her. And she knows that, but her mental state is so bad it's hard for her to take it into consideration.

Just a bit ago before she laid down she was saying how she is a burden, and how she makes everything worse and she's just done. She's not even depressive anymore, today she was super energetic and paranoid ECT, so I'm 95% sure she's manic now, but she's still so suicidal, and with being manic she is a lot more impulsive. I feel like I need to do something asap, I know I need to try and figure this out before I leave, I don't want to lose my best friend of all time.

I've joined three coaching classes in my life alongwith an expensive college without any scholarship. And all I did was bunk those coaching classes, in college maintained minimum grades and attendance, and did nothing there except chain smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol whenever it was for free or would buy sometimes from my father's hard earned money, and buy weed and smoke it to the point of abuse.

I'm about to turn 23 and am unemployable, lacking empathy for others, not earning my bread and still eating off my father's earned money. Though I'm 218 days sober from weed, 172 days sober from cigarettes, and I drank like a monster in my friend's hotel room and puked there.

I was basically a cheapo (and still am) in college too. I was abusing nicotine, alcohol and weed very irresponsibly. Didn't learn anything in college, suffering my ignorance with criminal and suicidal tendencies. I'm an individual lacking integrity and purpose in life. Also, I'm a Piscean.

And I forgot to mention one thing, I've taken energy drinks at one point of my life (I think around 16-17 years of age). 

I also sold a gold ring my father bought me, and took loan from many of the new and old friends of mine to buy weed. And one fact about me is I'm a middle class adult, with no sense of responsibility. I eat junk food (though quit it now) like a monster.

But I was a very intelligent kid in my school days that the headmaster of my first school made me skip a class in kindergarten. As a result, I'm still younger than most of my peers. I only have an undergraduate degree with a shameful GPA (I'm ugly to the point that I wasn't and still not eligible for the best jobs in my field of study, or for higher studies). And I have a second class degree because I completed my degree in 5 years instead of 4. 

I'm also unable to support my parents financially (though I don't need to, but I should because they have done so much for me, and I should replicate the love). But I can't do so, because I'm incapable mentally. My life has deteriorated to a large extent. I'm a dysfunctional and antisocial (or more accuratelt, socially anxious) member of the society. 

So basically it's like this. The real me has died. And I'm an adult behaving like a child. But I have a vision of becoming a conscious rapper like J Cole or Kendrick Lamar (I'm a big fan of both and done extensive research of their lyrics, cadence and style with the help of the Genius app).

**Intro:** My sister has been using (mainly heroin) for the past 9-12 months which started after meeting/connecting with an addict who was a rebound relationship following the conclusion of a painful divorce. She has never had supportive men in her life and has left one destructive relationship to the next. Prior to all of this she has never had (to our knowledge) past experiences with drug use and always said she never understood how/why people used.

**The Discovery:** She lives/lived in Florida and our family first found out about the drug use in October after my mother went down to visit based on suspicions of things feeling ""off"" when they communicated. We then discovered she dug herself into a deep hole of debt and was borrowing/begging/stealing to keep her ""high"" alive. She agreed to come up to North Carolina where we have family living to help her detox and take steps towards recovery. Through her ""detox"" and ""recovery"" while she was back in North Carolina with us she claimed the entire time that she didn't have a problem with drugs and ""only did them occasionally as a social activity with friends"" and insisted that she was done using. She started seeing a therapist while she was here and seemed to be making forward progress with ""normalizing"" but I could tell she had no intentions of staying here. She would frequently mention missing Florida and ""the feel of home"" it gave her.

**The Relapse:** A job opportunity from a past work relationship was presented to her and that gave her the out to leave and head back down to Florida. Against all of our advice she left and began work down there. Communication with her while she was there always felt superficial but she would tell us how good she was doing and how well everything was going. Flash forward a few months later she came back to visit us for Memorial Day but didn't quite seem herself. We learned her addict boyfriend had gotten arrested ""borrowing her car"" without telling her and she found out through friends he was going around telling others the only reason he was with her was that she was his ""cash cow"". She was angry, disgusted, and was adamant that she has ""no interest in being with someone like that"". We were cautiously optimistic but two weeks later my mother got a call from her at 1am to pick her up in Florida because she had been to the hospital from painful hand and foot pain after using. She was hysterically crying and told us she had been using since she went back down and that she didn't want to feel like this anymore, didn't want to have to worry about how she was going to get her next meal, or find a place to sleep. We all got in the car, went down to Florida, and took her back to North Carolina to stay with my mom (who is also a nurse).

**Today:** We had hoped this past experience was her ""bottom"" but after a recent visit I'm not sure it was. She talks about her experiences living with drug dealers, being homeless, using, the ins and outs of drug use, etc. freely. All the music she listens to is about using or drugs and she's now talking to the addict boyfriend again after swearing him off a few weeks ago.

She has been back with us for just over a week and I don't know what to do to get her the help she needs. Our family doesn't have much money and she currently doesn't have insurance. My father thinks inpatient rehab, my mother thinks we cant afford it, and I'm in the middle trying to broker communications. We have no experience dealing with this and the last thing I want is for us to make decisions that we think are best for her without knowing what that truly is.

If nothing is done I am sure she will try to leave again and use.

**Summary**: The above only covers the surface of everything thats been going on. If you have any advice or can share experiences I would be eternally grateful. I'm scared but hopeful if the right steps are taken can help her get to a point of recovery.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9970610737800598}"

To list the drugs I haven’t done would be far shorter than the list of drugs I have done. The one substance that has haunted every step I’ve taken has been fentanyl. It got to the point where I would wake up in WD. Chasing the dragon caused me to lose my house, my two jobs, my gf, even my dog. I lived in my car for a while and that was too much for me. I tried to take my life by way of OD but was seen by someone that called an ambulance. I spent days in a detox center leading me to where I am now. Currently I’m 4 months and 12 days sober. A miracle because I always thought I would do drugs until the day I died. I mean seriously even when I was smoking pot I would smoke so much all day everyday that it became a mission to just maintain a level of feeling. I wouldn’t even get that high. For anyone reading this that is in that cycle of addiction that feels like hell I want to tell you that you can beat this and live life as it was meant to be lived. I used drugs to escape my reality and I thought that the drugs were helping. In fact it made things worse and sent me down a deep rabbit hole of denial and pain. If you take drugs as prescribed for medical issues then they could really be helping and I’m not talking to those people. I’m talking to the people like me that were depressed and had anxiety and used every drug they could find to help themselves escape that reality. This is the hardest thing I’ve ever done but everyday I’m so happy that I don’t have to feed an addiction. Opiate WD is terrible and for me it was a prison. I just want to tell people that you can beat it and come out even stronger than before. Everyone’s situation is unique and different but this is what I think after my nine year run. Starting from the first time at 12 when I popped perc 10’s to recently when I was slamming a daily amount of fentanyl that would kill a horse.

2020-06-15 07:14:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/h9ea0h/in_the_realm_of_hungry_drug_warriors/,In the Realm of Hungry Drug Warriors," I began reading Gabor Maté's popular book on addiction yesterday (""In  the Realm of Hungry Ghosts"") but gave it up in disappointment after the  first 20 pages convinced me that the author was in the thrall of not  only drug war propaganda, but also of the propaganda of Big Pharma as  well.  My original interest in the book was prompted by the story of his  use of ayahuasca to treat addicts and the predictable state suppression  that it brought about as Canada attempts to keep in lockstep with  America's anti-patient war on mother nature's plants, more commonly (and  misleadingly) referred to as the drug war.  But if we want countries  like Canada to change their policies on these topics, we have to see  through the drug warrior lies and assumptions to what's really going on,  and Maté seems to be just as blinded on this topic as virtually  everyone else in mainstream Western society.  
 

First of all, the very use of the term ""addiction"" invites us to  moralize and pry into a user's past to investigate their inner demons.   But this judgmental word, ""addiction,"" only came into fashion with the  drug war itself, before which opium enthusiasts, for instance, were  merely designated neutrally as ""habitues"" when they used the drug with a  frequency that rendered withdrawal difficult.  The judgemental term  ""addiction"" is attractive to Westerners because it helps us Medicalize  what we consider to be ""the drug problem"" - but Gabor's notion that  virtually all addiction (i.e. habituation) can be traced to inner pain  is just plain wrong.  Was Benjamin Franklin dealing with inner pain when  he liberally availed himself of opium?  Was Sigmund Freud dealing with  inner pain when he used massive amounts of cocaine?  Was Richard Feynman  dealing with inner pain when he casually popped pills that we would  derisively refer to today as ""speed""? Is a blues musician, for that  matter, dealing with inner pain when he or she uses daily marijuana in  order to  ""keep in the groove""?  
 

Let's be honest: the real crime of folks like Franklin, Freud and  Feynman is that they self-medicated. They had the gall to bypass the  medical establishment which claims to have a monopoly on deciding when  and how a human being should adjust their mood.  
 

So this is the first mistake that Gabor makes: he is simply wrong that  all (or even most) addiction can be explained by a person's inner pain.  
 

But Gabor compounds this error by his apparent blindness to the great  addiction crisis of our time. I say ""apparent blindness"" because the  first 20 pages of his highly praised book on addiction says absolutely  NOTHING about this massive addiction: namely, the fact that one in eight  American males (and one in four American females) are addicted to Big  Pharma medications, antidepressants and benzodiazepines (and I'm sure  there are comparably egregious statistics among Maté's fellow  Canadians).   Is the take-home message from this stealth drug crisis  merely that large segments of the American population are dealing with  inner pain?  No. The take-home message is that Big Pharma is cranking  out highly addictive medications while simultaneously suborning the  medical world into remaining silent about the overmedicated dystopia  that it is thereby creating.  
 

**On the disingenuous distinction between addiction and chemical dependency.**  
 

The problem is that Maté, like most Western academics, seems to think  that there's a meaningful difference between ""addiction"" and ""chemical  dependency."" According to this line of reasoning, substances like heroin  truly addict you and are therefore ""drugs,"" while substances like  antidepressants merely render you chemically dependent and are therefore  ""medications.""  But the supposed differences here are largely illusory,  especially from a user point of view. To see why, let's examine  Webster's definition of the term ""addiction"":  
 

**Addiction: The compulsive uncontrolled use of habit-forming drugs  beyond the period of medical need or under conditions harmful to  society.**  
 

One could argue that the antidepressant user is not compulsive and does  not behave in an uncontrolled fashion.  Yes, but why is that so?  That  is so because the supply of medication is always forthcoming.  A patient  in need of an SSRI is never told by the pharmacist that the supply will  be delayed due to the recent arrest of a drug runner.   Nor does a  pharmacist ever ""top off"" the contents of an SSRI capsule with boric  acid or baby powder as a cost-saving measure.  And so we're unlikely to  see ragged-out white collar workers, sweating and puking on the streets  because they're going cold turkey on an anti-depressant or have consumed  tainted product. The safe and pristine supply of their go-to drug is  guaranteed and, as they're admonished by their own doctor to take the  drug for life, withdrawal symptoms never have a chance to occur, least  of all in public venues where we can see the cramping and vomiting and  think to ourselves, as we do of the strung-out heroin addict: ""Tsk-tsk,  that poor SSRI addict!""  
 

And so SSRIs do not meet the criterion of ""addiction"" according to which  they must be used  ""beyond the period of medical need,"" but this is  only because the doctors who prescribe them claim that the period of  medical need never ends, which is a very convenient claim indeed,  considering that these drugs, which were originally meant for short-term  use only, have since proven to be highly habit-forming.  
 

And so, nit-picking aside, the daily use of antidepressants seems to  qualify as an addiction according to Webster's Dictionary - until, that  is, we read the final subjective criterion of the definition, namely  that addiction occurs ""under conditions harmful to society.""  
 

Here we come to the truth about addiction: it's a pejorative and  subjective term, used only in connection with substances that we as a  drug-warrior society have decided to denigrate and demonize as harmful.   There is therefore a kind of political agenda behind the use of the  term ""addiction,"" that is, to implicitly demonize certain plant  medicines (namely the illegal ones) while implicitly canonizing others  (legally synthesized antidepressants and benzodiazepines).  A society  that is free of drug-war presuppositions, however, would simply class  all psychoactive substances as psychoactive substances and treat them  all equally according to the objective and statistical threats that they  pose to an unwary user. Instead, we give Big Pharma a free pass to  wreak damage with its ""medicines,"" while we wave a disapprobatory finger  in the face of those who use ""drugs"" like heroin. Meanwhile, we fail to  register the fact that many of the latter ""drug"" users could live just  as happily in society as their antidepressant-using neighbors, were  their drug supply rendered as safe and reliable as that of their  law-abiding fellows.   
 

Of course, many people are fed up with being dependent on a given  psychoactive substance, precisely because of the dependency itself.    But here we encounter another drug-war bias in the way that we think  about such topics.   Drug Warriors will loudly decry the mere potential  of addiction that certain illegal substances might seem to pose, but,  like Maté himself in the opening of his book on this subject, they say  absolutely nothing about the great dependency of our time: the fact that  1 in 8 American males and 1 in 4 American females are addicted to legal  antidepressants, with similar numbers around the globe, at least in  Western countries.  
 

For my part, I've always thought that the worst part about an addiction  was that it forced me to rely on other people. Yet I find that almost no  one -- neither drug warriors nor psychiatrists - has a problem with the  fact that my addiction to Effexor has made me reliant on prescribing  psychiatrists and has thus turned me into an eternal patient and a ward  of the state. Talk about disempowering.  I have to travel 40 miles every  three months to meet with a psychiatrist in a mental health clinic for a  half-hour in order to tell him how I feel.  God, I've been a patient  for 40 years, what business is it of his???  
 **Why Self-Medicating Makes Sense**

This is why I make the following otherwise unheard-of claim: that not  only can a so-called ""drug user"" be said to be ""self-medicating,"" but he  or she is often right to do so.  Consider the options, after all, for  someone who desires psychological healing.  They can...  
 

**One:** take the legal route, and become addicted for life to a drug  that conduces to anhedonia, for which they will have to make regular  pilgrimages to a mental health clinic, in order to receive a three-month  drug supply for which they will have to pay dearly, all the time being  reminded by this time-consuming rigamarole that they are an eternal  patient and a ward of the state...  
 

Or they can...  
 

**Two:**  Buy a psychoactive plant medicine on the black market and,  if they've done their research and been lucky, get their head screwed  back on straight inexpensively and without having been turned into an  eternal patient by doing so.  
 

Ironically, under the drug war's starkly limited psychoactive  pharmacopoeia of addictive pills,  it almost seems like going the legal  route would itself be a sign of mental illness, or at least of  pathologically poor judgment.    
 

My goal here is not to slam talk therapy per se, nor to deny that Gabor  makes great progress with his patients.  But the fact that he's been  stymied in that goal by the Drug War itself means that it's imperative  for him and other professionals like him to start seeing through the  mist of drug warrior lies (the hypocrisy, the newspeak, and the hidden  premises) and see clearly what is going on in the world with respect to  psychoactive substances, their regulation, and the dilemmas that these  legal circumstances pose for well-intentioned people who just want peace  of mind without being treated like criminals  by law enforcement (or  being derisively dismissed as self-medicators by psychiatrists).   Only  by divining and then shunning the many false drug war assumptions can we  disenchant the world from the spell of that anti-patient and  violence-causing crusade.  Meanwhile, we should stop imputing pathology  to drug users merely because they have chosen to buy plant medicines  that have been unjustly proscribed by politicians, and in violation of  natural law at that, especially when the drug user's alternative was to  turn his or herself into an eternal patient, forced to visit a therapist  every three months of their life and, like the Ancient Mariner, recite  the same old personal narrative on every demoralizing visit.    
 

AUTHOR'S NOTE: Of course, Gabor has grabbed onto part of the truth.  The  Drug War does stop us from dealing with the underlying conditions that  often lead to dysfunctional behavior.  This makes it a godsend for  conservatives, because if we weren't seeing everything through the lens  of the drug war, we'd have to deal with the great inequities of modern  social life in terms of education and opportunities.  And the drug war  has worked incredibly well for conservatives in this regard.  It's no  coincidence that the death of '60s idealism coincided with the creation  of the DEA and the ascendancy of drug war conservatives like Ronald  Reagan, folks who wanted guns and business to be as unregulated as  possible while they yet prosecuted an unprecedented crack down on mere  possession of psychoactive plants.  They wanted capitalism that was  unfettered by the idealistic visions that tended to arise from expanded  consciousness.  So they simply made expanded consciousness a felony, to  ensure their political hegemony by force of law.  
 

Nor do I scorn Gabor's psychotherapeutic approach, an approach which I  trust will be infinitely more fruitful in the future when it is aided by  some of the psychoactive plant medicines that modern psychiatrists have  dutifully ignored to date in deference to the Christian Science  imperative of the Drug War.   
 

Gabor's mistake, I believe, is to automatically associate illicit drug  use with pathology -- when, as I've attempted to show above, there are  many rational reasons why a thoughtful human being in search of mood  medicine would seek a black-market alternative to the psychiatric status  quo, a status quo that would otherwise turn him or her into an eternal  patient and thus a ward of the health care state, destined to spend a  life-time being emotionally catechized by strangers in order to receive  yet another ""fix"" from Big Pharma's expensive, limited, and highly  addictive pharmacopoeia.  Indeed, if Gabor is in search of pathology, he  may well find more of it in Americans who placidly submit themselves to  such a life-sapping and disempowering status quo, since the ready  acceptance of such a scheme, as legal as it might be, would seem to  signal a poor self-image and masochism -- or at very least an inability  to clearly see how the drug war is depriving him or her of chemical  godsends that might otherwise have afforded emotional salvation.",2,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9806516766548157}"

i dropped out of college because when my life started falling apart yet again, i thought that drugs, weed and alcohol would keep me sane. i would roll every two or three weeks, mix it with alcohol and other dangerous stuff. i would snort shit, lose my mind and take more. i would smoke tons of weed every single day to the point i would have to skip classes cause i was too fucked up to even move. and all of that while being on antidepressants. i mean, to roll i had to stop taking them and that’s what fucked me up even more.

at the beginning of this year i started smoking weed excessively again, when i didn’t have money for weed i would drink shitty, actually the cheapest beer that’s out there, also pretty much everyday. 

then i got back home cause of the quarantine and dropping out. i would still drink pretty much everyday, i was buying beers and hiding them, so my mom and sister wouldn’t call me an alcoholic. 

every time something bad happens or i’m at my lowest i turn to drugs and alcohol. because of them i even harmed myself. it was while being drunk, after all those year being clean and not doing anything to myself i did it and i feel so SO ashamed. 

i decided to stop drinking and smoking weed, i was clean for 6 days and on the 11th i went to visit my friend. there we rolled again. in the end i took to much and had typical symptoms of serotonin syndrome. and even tho i knew what’s happening and i should stop, i took even more. i couldn’t think straight, my mind was gone, i couldn’t even speak. then someone brang vodka to the table and so i started drinking. in the morning, when i started coming down and realizing what i just did, i honestly wanted to kms.

i am only 22 and i am so so so scared of the consequences all of this can have on my health.

this friday, when i got back home, i decided i really want to get clean, like, for real clean. no drinking, no drugs, no weed.

i don’t know how it’s gonna be but i really wanna live like a normal human being. i wasted so many years of my life on shit i don’t even wanna talk about, i’ve had enough of this.

so hi, if you are somehow still here i wanna thank you for listening.  

i will try to go under the therapy if i find one, but i also struggle financially so it might be hard. i take xanax for anxiety but i don’t abuse it. i hope it won’t have any bad influence on my liver because i can imagine she’s not in the best state right now. i also take other meds but yeah.

overall i am scared of living like this, i live in constant fear of EVERYTHING because of my anxiety and the alcohol/drugs addiction is like a rotten cherry on top of the worst cake. i don’t know if this shit runs in my blood, family or what but i don’t wanna be like this. i wanna get help but i don’t even know how to start.

sorry for posting this here but i honestly don’t know where to seek someone to talk to. 

have a good one and again thank you for listening",2,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986182451248169}"

I guess I didnt know how deep it went till we finalized our relationship. There were points in time where he'd do it everyday of the week, and I'd be right there doing it with him... I knew it wasn't right, this wasn't just recreational fun anymore. This was turning into an unhealthy full blown addiction. I tried to convince him that we just did it the day before, did we really need to waste money on more? Maybe we should have a night to recover, maybe we should stop all together? But, my pleads and suggestions never worked. Because even though I'd say ""no"" the moment he came through the door with that bag, we'd be doing lines together. There were some days however I just felt so done and frustrated with it. He'd bring it home, and I wouldn't partake, so he'd finish it all by himself. Nights when one run turned into 2 or 3 increased. I couldn't take it anymore. It wasnt fun, it was sad, it was angering, and I couldn't feel. I was disassociated, and trapped inside of myself. It had to stop... This went on from about August to December. Then, we made a pact if you will. We promised eachother that after bringing in the New Year, we would leave yayo in 2019. That was something I could agree to, something I could get excited about and look forward to. Since January the first of 2020, I have been sober. And, I'm proud to have made that decision, because on January 11th, I found out we were going to have a baby... With the news and the pact in order, I thought 2020 would be filled with nothing, but upward growth. Until I found out my s/o hadn't been sober since January first. The pact was broken.It turned into constant deceit, whether or not he was getting clean. He would come home high, and then drink all night which resulted in some of our worst arguments. His impulsivity and judgment while he was high were TERRIBLE. He'd do and say things that I know the real him would never. So, I excused the bad behavior, because I knew he just needed some sleep. There have been many times now that I threatened to leave him, and told him his baby didnt deserve to see their father that way. I tried to talk him into treatment, therapy, anything that could help him get and stay clean. But, he can ""handle"" it. He's ""got it."" I just have to ""trust"" him. I tried to trust his word, but after seeing him fail us time and time again I am not so sure. I do want to give him praise for making it just about 3 weeks clean, but now he's relapsed again, and I'm afraid this vicious cycle will never end. It has been a huge financial and emotional burden for me, this definitely isnt what I imagined my first pregnancy would look like... That's one of things that saddens me the most, is that he loves his baby. He loves feeling them kick, and  loves talking to my belly. This is both of our first child, and we couldn't be more excited. I just feel like I cannot allow our baby to be exposed to such toxicity. I'm so sad, and in love, and torn. I dont know what to do...",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9965380430221558}"

Tldr: husband has a roommate who is possibly addicted to drugs. How do I get him out of my husband's house?

Husband and I do not live together because of reasons (happily married, just reasons). We have  kids. Husband has a roommate that has been living with him for about 2-3 years, they are very good friends, and have known eachother since before my husband met me. Husband took the friend in because the friend got divorced and lost his job and needed a place to stay. Dude hasn't done anything with himself the past 2-3 years. Guy is pretty cool, he helps watch the kids when husband visits me, I'm chill with him living in the house and we are all fine and dandy.

Around 6 months ago, husband describes roomate as ""looking sickly"". No real reason, or weird behavior, just looks like ""he's lost a bit of weight"". A month or two goes by, no weird behavior, everything seems to be fine again. 

Roomate gets a new girlfriend. Husband describes her as ""looking like a former addict"". Husband doesn't describe the girlfriend doing anything odd or anything. They are cool together. Husband then starts to notice that some of the kids ADHD and sleep meds are missing. He counts them and makes sure that he isn't losing them. He consistently sees over the next few weeks that they are slowly going unaccounted for. Husband doesn't think it's the kids. He starts to suspect the roomate. He doesn't directly confront him about it, instead he just hides the meds and now keeps them in a lock box in his room. They stop getting stolen. The roomate doesn't exhibit any weird behavior this whole time. Still a cool dude. Girlfriend is still chill.

A month and a half ago, husband starts to notice that phone or Internet is slow. Roomate comments as well. Roomate does some stuff with router, and is under the impression someone has hacked the internet and some of the devices in the house. He tells this to my husband. My husband is not computer savvy and is now pretty concerned. He leaves the tech stuff to roomate, and tells roomate not to give him all the info because it will make him scared. Roomate thinks that the computer, their phones, the DVR, and his Bluetooth headphones have been hacked by a neighbor. Roomate tells my husband that he's been contacted by a hacker (through code I guess), and sent the roomate porn and they talked a little bit. Husband doesn't know what they talked about. Roomate tells husband that he thinks it's a neighbor cuz of some tracker stuff and thinks he can ping the location of the hacker to a neighbor. 

The roomate is now up all hours of the night working on this stuff. Husband says that roomate is slowly getting more erratic. Roomate says that he's been working on his car (his car IS broken down) and says that he's getting pieces of metal caught under his skin (I asked if he's getting pieces of metal in his skin, is he wearing a mask and breathing it in. Husband says he is not wearing a mask but he isn't complaining of respiratory issues). Roomate is walking around the house at night with flashlight ""looking for bugs from the hacker"". Husband says that roomate is constantly stressed out looking for this hacker

Two days ago the air conditioning goes out upstairs, and the alarm system in the house is not working. Husband calls technicians in to come look at them. Tech guy working on alarm system says that it's broken (husband says that he is only one who knows password). Tech notices roommates behavior and takes my husband aside and the tech dude is some kind of alcoholics anonymous (or some kind of addiction counselor) and asks my husband what's up with the roomate. The tech dude thinks it's drugs. Up to this point I didn't put 2 and 2 together because I thought it coulda been some kind of hack (I'm not IT expert), but the itchy skin, taking pills a few months ago, erratic behavior, and paranoia it all makes sense. Husband is in disbelief, and takes kids and to hotel last night to sleep.

Husband comes back this morning, one of the kids room is pretty much taken apart, upstairs is the same, bathroom has baseboards taken out, there's a picture taken apart from the living room, the cable in the living room is no longer working, husband is calling me and roomate is coming out to check on husband, and check the garage. Husband says that roomate called the cops, because he thought there was a ""man in the toolshed in the back yard"" (not broken into, husband is only one with the key to the lock), and roomate said the cops questioned his sanity. Husband says that since the drug use comment, he's noticed pock marks, looking like meth sores on the roomate.

I keep telling husband that he needs to take kids to the babysitter, and either sit the roomate down and outright ask him about any drug use, take the guy to get tested, or kick Jim out or call the cops while the kids are out. Husband is in disbelief, and doesn't know whether to believe it's actually a hacking situation and lack of sleep and paranoia is making roomate crazy, or if it's actually drug use. Husband is pretty much frozen with fear and him and the kids are still at the house with the roomate.

How do I, across the entire country, make this dude get out of the house. I'd rather have a husband who's mad at me or risk this relationship rather than get a phone call that my husband or kids are dead from some guy who's methed out.

Kids are all adopted, originally foster kids. I don't wanna call CPS and get them all taken away permanently because of my actions. I'm afraid if I call the cops they won't take the roomate away, husband gets mad, and roomate is now pissed off or something.

I use something pretty much every day whether that's alcohol or weed or less frequently coke, pills, or hallucinogens, although I probably use at least one of the latter at least once a week. I don't always feel a ""craving"" for them and often am using for social reasons because everyone around me does.

That being said, I've been considering quitting drinking. I have a few social functions coming up in the next 6 or so months that will involve drinking with people who drink and will probably be less enjoyable without drinking.... I just feel like I can't quit until after those obligations are finished, which feels weird because it's like if I just want to quit,  I just should, but also my reluctance to do so probably indicates a larger problem and I just don't know where to go from here.

I'm not even sure what to classify as an addiction, I've taken time off of all of these things in the past without issue.  I've always considered myself a social drinker and have seen addiction up close and promised not to let myself get to that point, but now I'm worried I'm just justifying my own issues.

I got addicted to caffeine from a fairly early age. Ever since then my motivation to do work that I either HAVE to do, or even to do work that I’m passionate about, nonetheless comes exclusively from caffeine, only until very recently. I still have a lot of bad days though.

Since all of this quarantine stuff began, I’ve managed to (mostly) quit my obscene use of caffeine. Here are some reflections about the negative experiences I’ve become aware of regarding my caffeine use (they would typically go right under my nose, if I hadn’t quit). I’ve concluded that caffeine ultimately made me less productive and a much less effective person as a whole. I really don’t think typical articles online really do these negative effects justice:

1. **Bouts of depression and anger.** Towards the end of the day, after drinking a lot of caffeine, I’d get very depressed about the most random and insignificant things, either about my past or about things going on in my life currently. The smallest offenses would also set me off and get me very angry, whether it was teasing from a friend, or some kind of worrying headline that I’d read in the news.
2. **It never actually helped me focus on my work.** Right after drinking the caffeine, I’d become very scatter-brained. Instead of writing/editing, I’d start getting sidetracked by, for instance, reading really niche Medium articles. My brain would start branching off in all sorts of directions chasing ideas. I’d start organizing my desk, or cleaning my room; things that are productive at face value, but not productive in the right way. I’d start focusing on minuscule details in my work, instead of focusing on making actual progress.
3. **Produced bad social skills for me.** Relying on extrinsic motivation to help you engage with others, and with the world at large, is never good. There have been times where I didn’t have access to caffeine in social situations at school, and I’d find myself being highly anxious/awkward. This set me up for failure down the road in learning how to develop solid and lasting relationships.

I know most of you probably use caffeine in a healthy way; like having a cup of Joe every morning is totally fine. Do you agree with some of these points, or is caffeine helpful for your focus? For those who maybe resonate with any of these points, what is your story? Any advice you guys have?

I've known her a couple years. She lived on my street, we went to the same church. She's always been unique, an intellectual, a loner. Her own woman. She's also been candid about the struggles in her life, including addiction.

In the past year, she's faced some of the typical hardship of life. Lost her parents, broken friendships, money problems. An added challenge is that she is using methamphetamine regularly. She's received a legal settlement, and has plenty of money right now, and this seems to be fueling her use.

What's the best way to be a friend to her right now? What's the right way to be her friend? We talk on the phone, and I've seen her a couple times. I'm not interested in judging her, or counseling her. I wouldn't know how. But I don't want to encourage or enable things that hurt her either.

She'll speak about the negatives -- weird new fears, sleeplessness, struggling to focus. My strategy is to listen, to hang in the conversation. But I don't want to look back in a few years and realize I should've been doing something else, and it's this concern I bring to the sub.

I am tired of video games. I want to stop, but I cant find anything else that can take up as much time, for as little cost, that provides as much entertainment. Its especially hard during lockdownish times, but even before that I struggled. Not sure where to start.

&#x200B;

Guess we could start with my current situation. I live on my own, have a job I love, completely support myself, and never let my gaming get in the way of my responsibilities. But that is really the line. Every waking moment available is pretty much spent time playing video games. I felt especially bad last year when I had to put down my 16 year old dog, and upon reflection, realized that especially during his later years, I kind of neglected him. I have a room mate who has dogs so it was not like he was alone, I just barely spent time with him. Mostly because I was always playing video games. Even when I was spending time with him, I was thinking about what I would do when I got back to playing.

&#x200B;

I don't really have friends. I have two people I could call up and hang out with if I wanted to, but theyre kinda shitty people I dont even like, I mostly just hang out with them because I know I should spend more time around people, and theyre the only people who wanna hang out. I have one friend I talk to from time to time that Ive known for 17 years, but we moved apart a long time ago, and we chat only a few times a year. Before lockdown I used to go salsa dancing fairly often, cause I do like women. I am a pretty good dancer and chicks like dancing with me, but I cant hold a conversation to save my life. I dont like chatting, and especially dont like putting up with women, which is why dancing fits perfectly cause I can interact plenty and not have to say much. Im sure id have plenty of girlfriends if I was any good at conversation but I really cant get past hating it. I dont get how people enjoy lengthy conversations. 

&#x200B;

On that note, I think I might be sociopathic. I realized this is probably the case when I posted something apparently so offensive (though with no vulgarity) in the psychopath reddit, and got banned there. It occurred to me that the way I think about things must be so abnormal as to unsettle psychopaths. I am anti social for sure, but never considered the depth or where it might come from. It would make sense that this is where my general disdain for people comes from, and it makes for me not having anything to get out of video addiction for. I genuinely don't like talking to people. 

&#x200B;

So you might wonder why I would want to stop playing video games. I just dont enjoy them any more. I get a shadow of the entertainment that I used to, which is why I still play them, but I really want there to be something else that I want to do. Theres nothing except banging chicks really, which, with the previous problem, is hard when I cant go dancing. 

&#x200B;

So im stuck. I cant find anything away from video games to do, except my job, which can be fun but after a full day with maybe some over time I am ready to relax. Any help would be appreciated.",3,{'lockdown': 2},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9938495755195618}"

Regardless, either by her own hand, or from my moms convincing, she decided to check into rehab earlier today. I had no idea she was even going, but when I went downstairs to check on something, she was gone and left a note that said “I love you mom! The next time you see me I’ll be better than ever! :)” 

I don’t know what about that note got to me, but I broke down. I’ve usually been the rock for my mother and oldest sister to lean on through all of this, so I’ve tried my best to not let our situation get to me, but something about that note gave me hope that my big sister is still in there, and I just stared crying harder than I have in a really long time.

I have been blessed to break my PMO addiction, and am grateful every day for the life I get to live because of it, but one of the key factors in my recovery was cold approach pick up, it may be seen as taboo, but going out every night to bars and clubs and talking to girls, changed my life forever.

I made a habit to go out at least 2x a week to clubs or bars (sober) and talk to a minimum of 3 girls, would usually end up in a lot more, but I started small. at first it was terrifying, but as I went out more and more I got better, and more results, I went on dates and had amazing sexual experiences. But most importantly it helped me let go of PMO addiction, instead of fapping in the night, I forced myself to go out, I spent time talking to real girls, and having amazing adventures. And eventually along with a number of techniques my addiction started to fade away, I reached a streak of 90+, then 200, then 300+ and then I stopped counting until Im on around 1000+ as I stopped counting 2.5 years ago.

The best moment was looking in the mirror after having amazing sex with my new girlfriend, having no PIED, and not even being able to remember the porn I used to watch. I almost cried, knowing I had broken my addiction, I looked down at a girl, that 2 years ago I would have only been able to dream about while jerking of in my bathroom.

My brother is addicted to and dealing cocaine, and won’t listen to reason because suddenly everything is seemingly good in his world.","My brother has never really had a motivated life. He never excelled at school, never really got an actual job, has never moved out of my grandparent’s house. He ended up associating with the Latin Kings and got scammed out of $8,000 with a gun to his face. My grandfather ended up having to pay the money, while my brother spiraled deeper into depression, PTSD, and general anger issues due to arguments with my grandparents. My grandma uses medical marijuana (mainly for depression and anxiety as well), so my brother smoked for a long period as well to try and deal with the psychological damage, but insisted it made him too paranoid. Every time I’ve asked about therapists, he just says they make him feel worse, despite me telling him that from experience, not every therapist is the “one.” I’m not sure if he’s ever been on antidepressants, he tends to ignore that completely when I bring it up. His life has generally been hitting rock bottom for the last 6ish years.

I just learned that as a sort of replacement for weed, he has begun doing and dealing cocaine via a licensed psychiatrist (whoever this person is, I swear he ought to walk right out of his job and find me so I can fucking slap him.) My brother is absolutely convinced that a. he won’t get caught and b. that this is the best option he has in terms of what he’s doing with his life and how to deal with his psychological issues. I myself have depression and anxiety and have been on antidepressants for a decade, and I am trying to convince him to see a different psychiatrist or therapist or psychologist or absolutely anything, or that there are clearly better options than hard felony drugs. I’m also trying to get it through his head that there is absolutely NO guarantee he won’t be caught and that what he’s doing is 200% stupid. That he’s feeling good and optimistic right now because the money and drugs are literally pouring endorphins into his brain. But because of this, there’s this wall up that’s deflecting everything I’m trying to say, and instead he’s trying to convince ME that what he’s doing is great and foolproof. I understand why, To the extent I can without experiencing it. But that doesn’t change the fact that what he’s doing is dangerous and I know I need to try to stop him and help him.

I’m at a loss. He asked me not to tell our family and I gave him my word, but this seems like an absolute emergency. I’m just afraid that if I tell our family or someone that could directly interject that he’ll do something incredibly stupid, i.e. kill himself. I’m afraid that telling my family will somehow make the situation 10x worse. It’s hard for me to help directly as I moved out 10 years ago and live 9 hours away.

I'm a 24 yr old woman who was close to a year of sobriety, then had a lapse that resulted in an overdose a little over a month ago, but since hasn't used and doesn't think I'm likely to given how awful that last experience was and how long the physical debilitating effects took to leave, and I may be continuing to have some including seizures - I'm trying to figure out if that's related considering it would have been going on for a long time after the use, but I did accidentally use about 4x what a heavy user of that drug would do, and I had only done that drug twice before (it wasn't my DOC). So I'm a year sober now, minus one day, which I know isn't the NA or AA method of counting only completely continuous unbroken time abstinent, but I'm not in the program anyway and I don't really actively count time, just progress in terms of infrequency of use and the dependency I observe in myself and whether I'm managing my concurrent disorders and my responsibilities decently- I see an addictions and concurrent disorders therapist regularly who works in the outpatient center for my last rehab. 

My question for you guys, and this is also a post asking for anyone who can relate to let me know they are experiencing something similar if they should so feel safe to do so and inclined, is, what do you do about, as it seems is the case for me, dealing with the long-term damage you may have done to your mental and physical health in your use? 

I am fortunate to not have much more serious issues than the occasional seizure (it used to be substance induced, but I apparently fucked with my brain so much I just plain have epilepsy now) and really really severe fatigue and obviously horrifically low dopamine levels. I was a cocaine addict, for 7 years, and a lot of people I know who used for even longer and quit this drug and other recreational drugs and have as much or even less sober time than I do don't have these symptoms so long after they entered into lives of sobriety. But I have to take ADHD medications now, and have been tested for a million things to try and find any solution, to stay awake, and somehow my tolerance for stims has remained the same and I am prescribed above a legally and medically advisable dose, and I find myself having to take more than that just to get by for a few hours of the day. I was tired when I was depressed and in an episode prior to my diagnosis, for sure, but I was never this bad, all the time, regardless of my mood, and of course that level of fatigue (aka unable to get out of bed if I don't take my stimulant medication, even to go eat food or shower, could fall asleep on the living room floor, can't even start an assignment for my uni courses, because I'd be asleep with my face on my computer in 10 seconds, and even on those meds people comment on how low energy and out of it I often am). 

I don't know what to do about this anymore, it's debilitating and terrible for trying to stabilize my mood at at least a level of semi-functional acceptance and okay-ish-ness. It makes me feel so hopeless, and so embarrassed when I try to be around friends and family or work (prior to COVID which has shut my workplace down still). 

Does anyone else think they like destroyed their dopamine receptors and depleted their dopamine levels so frequently and extensively the damage just doesn't seem to be repairing itself as many parts of the brain are typically able to?

I wanted to share this quote from it, and see what your views are:

&#x200B;

"" “At the core of every addiction is an emptiness based in abject fear. The addict dreads and abhors the present moment; she bends feverishly only toward the next time, the moment when her brain, infused with her drug of choice, will briefly experience itself as liberated from the burden of the past and the fear of the future—the two elements that make the present intolerable. Many of us resemble the drug addict in our ineffectual efforts to fill in the spiritual black hole, the void at the center, where we have lost touch with our souls, our spirit—with those sources of meaning and value that are not contingent or fleeting. Our consumerist, acquisition-, action-, and image-mad culture only serves to deepen the hole, leaving us emptier than before. The constant, intrusive, and meaningless mind-whirl that characterizes the way so many of us experience our silent moments is, itself, a form of addiction—and it serves the same purpose. “One of the main tasks of the mind is to fight or remove the emotional pain, which is one of the reasons for its incessant activity, but all it can ever achieve is to cover it up temporarily. In fact, the harder the mind struggles to get rid of the pain, the greater the pain.”14 So writes Eckhart Tolle. Even our 24/7 self-exposure to noise, e-mails, cell phones, TV, Internet chats, media outlets, music downloads, videogames, and nonstop internal and external chatter cannot succeed in drowning out the fearful voices within.”

I realised that it's not for me, and that I was only using to catch the dragon, which only happened once in a blue moon, which explained why I was using g so heavily. 
This experience, along with my tax return and being on CERB gave me the opportunity and confidence to move back to the city where my children live.

I have been smoking a lot of weed and using psycadelics quite heavily, I have been learning a lot about myself and what is important to me, my god so to speak. Well I ran out of weed and have been patiently waiting to pick up. Unfortunately being dry and a recent argument with my gf has triggered me and I have, for the first time, considered picking up some of that nasty synthetic, fortunately, I will be picking up today, I know that today I will not use it, but what about tomorrow? 

My cool confidence is wavering due to this and now I'm worried about the long term, I'm very impulsive, and am not sure how to manage myself in this respect. 

I enjoyed NA but I have no desire to stop using psycadelics  they help with depression,  anxiety, low self esteem and feelings of worthlessness, in other words I feel better then I ever have, and as for the weed, well I just really live that shit. Needless to say I wouldn't fit in in Na.

how slippery of a slope am I on right now?
Will this be forever?
Should I be worried? Or am I reading to much I to this?

....................................

Sometimes my mind is hard to control.
It takes me back to thoughts of you.
Are you all right out there on your own? 
Do you miss us? Do you want to come home?

Some days I miss your face 
and it hurts so much. 
Other days I’m still so angry
I question if you’re even capable of love.

When the high wears off and the man that I knew returns, do thoughts of us resurface? 
Does your heart hurt?

I often wonder how the man who bathed me when I was sick and held me as I slept,
could be the love of my life and also my biggest regret.

How could you love me and still deceive me? 
Why couldn’t you come to me or ask for help? 
How could you be willing to give up on our life together so easily?

I wake up at night expecting you to be there, to sigh then roll over and pull me close. 
Then reality sets in and I realize that I too, am all alone.

As angry as I may have been, 
I would’ve stood by your side. 
I wanted to understand your addiction so badly 
and I don’t know why.

I can’t make sense of it. 
What was real and what was a lie? 
How did I spend so many nights with you and not notice the signs?

I hope that my prayers find you and that you’re safe. 
May God watch over and protect you with each new day. 

I pray that the shakes and the cold sweats pass quickly when you need a fix 
and that the heroin doesn’t kill what’s left of the man I fell in love with. 

I know that you’re sorry. 
I know that you’re ashamed. 
I’m sorry for how hard you must have battled to keep your addictions hidden away.

I send you love and forgiveness wherever you are. 
I’ll never forget you.
And I’m praying each night for your recovery, like I pray for my heart.

I’ve always had a reliable source, but right as I am running out of pills I learned that they won’t supply for about 10 days.
I have just about enough to last me for 4 days. I won’t see my therapist or my addiction counsellor until then. I am very afraid of the withdrawals because I have gone through them cold turkey before and I do not want to experience that again, since it is also a great risk to my health.

My question is: Who should I turn to? Could my GP help me out with a prescription until I can go back to my old source or is that too risky? Should I contact my therapist early and try to get him to help me through the days ahead? Or should I wait until the withdrawal symptoms start and then go to the ER?

Hi everyone,  
If your life is affected by addiction, you need to see The Final Fix.

It’s about an treatment for addiction that has been in existence for the past 45 years but repeatedly shunned by authorities.

Narrated by Ewan McGregor, The Final Fix follows 5 chronic substance abusers as they trial this unique, non-pharmacy treatment known as N.E.T. (Neuro Electric Therapy). 

The N.E.T device was invented by a Scottish surgeon, Dr Meg Patterson, and claims to ‘***take addicts off their drug of addiction within 5-7 days with minimal discomfort and no future cravings*****’.** In the film, we document a full trial of this treatment in Kentucky, one of the worst-hit states in the opioid crisis.

The Final Fix Trailer: [https://vimeo.com/421493354](https://vimeo.com/421493354)

The full documentary is available to Buy/Rent - US: [https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fix-Ewan-McGregor/dp/B086Z6JK29](https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fix-Ewan-McGregor/dp/B086Z6JK29).

I was also living in a very very small, overpriced room. I couldn't move because I only made $550 biweekly and couldn't save enough. The room only had enough space for me to stand up or lay in bed. It was all killing me slowly.  I was going to college, but took a break to focus on sobriety. I loved going to college because it felt good to be striving toward success; toward a meaningful career; toward never having to work a job that I despise ever again. I started going to a program that is a harm reduction, science based outpatient treatment. I was really enjoying it. Then COVID hit, and so came my current dilemma. My treatment center started doing groups only through Microsoft Teams. This format just isn't the same and I don't feel that same connection that I felt in person. My phone sessions with my counselor are nice, but the groups are boring and unfulfilling. When I see others/myself express deep emotion, there isn't that same feeling I find healing.
Anyway, at the same time when COVID hit, the government started suppling those on employment an extra $600 a week for 13 weeks in addition to what is normally given for employment. I saw my opportunity, my escape plan. I lied to my workplace that I had COVID and I applied for unemployment immediately. To my surprise, I I received my benefits, along with the $600 stimulus bonus. It's like a gift from heaven, a gift straight from god. I started saving $500 each weekly payment, in about 2 weeks I moved out of that horrible room and found an amazing place that is all I could ever ask for. I like it so much I already decided I'm going to renew the lease for next year. Ever since moving here my drinking has cut back substantially and I feel much better, like I can finally breathe. I need this stimulus money from unemployment because I'm saving so much money right now that I can use to get ahead; money is opportunity. It's going to be about 2 months til the stimulus ends. However, my use is still concerning, I've used for 12 years. It isn't nearly as bad as it used to be, but I still struggle. There is an inpatient program that 3 of my friends have been to and they all said it was nice and helpful. I have another plan...as soon as the stimulus ends, I am going to attend that program, which is roughly 30-60 days I am using my savings to pay for my rent while I am gone so I have a place to go home to when I finish the program. I'm using the rest of the savings to find a job when I get out and anything left over to put towards a car.
I thank God very much for this blessing.
The only thing is, I want to go now but can't because I don't believe I can claim unemployment in an inpatient facility.
I must wait until I receive it all. I would be stupid not to; I've done this for 12 years, I can do it for 2 more months.
I really wish I could claim while in the program because I could save more because I wouldn't need to buy thing that I need to buy for living.
I pray that I can stay strong for just a bit longer. If I do, which I can, I will have a lot of doors open. I can do this, it's worth it. God give me the strength to hold on just a bit longer.",1,{'covid': 3},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.749356746673584}"

One could simply type something, and someone elsewhere would see it being typed in real-time. Although the first web browsers were text-only, it was only a matter of time until images could be sent and received. Shortly thereafter, videos entered the fray. Even before the first video made its way across the internet, pornography had sprung up all over.  
As with anything that appeals to or stimulates the pleasure centers in the body, it fostered a cycle of addiction in those people who were susceptible to such addictions. The first image trading took place in newsgroups, such as alt.binaries.erotica and its many clones. Such transfers were accomplished through bulletin board systems, up until 2017, porn addiction is has become an epidemic. Why has it become ubiquitous? Here are 10 reasons why:  


**10. It is a “forbidden fruit.”**  


Porn is enticing  


Ask any teenager, “What’s the one way to guarantee that you will do something?” Chances are, the teen will say, “Tell me not to do it.”The same holds true for many adults. Among them are many self-professed Christians, who actually access porn on a regular basis as much as non-Christians! According to the results of a 2014 survey, 64 percent of both Christians and non-Christians admitted to watching internet porn more than a few times per month. A bit less than 33 percent of these people said that they thought they might be addicted to porn.  


Why do we always want what we either can’t have or aren’t supposed to have? Research indicates that the roots of these particular desires fall sprout up in the far past when problem-solving and striving for that which was difficult or impossible to attain was necessary for survival.  


George Loewenstein calls his theory on this phenomenon the “information gap theory.” He references the human race’s natural curiosity regarding the environment. As an example, Joe the Caveman knows he can’t take down a saber-toothed tiger with his bare hands. Still, he wants to “get that tiger.” So, he looks around and sees a collection of sharp rocks. He attaches one to a sturdy shaft. Presto, he has a spear.  


When it comes to internet porn, the sexual longings of human beings, men in particular, often stray to married people of either gender. The unattainable object of one’s affection is the same as the saber-toothed tiger in the previous example. Instead of building a spear, however, 21st-century would-be Romeos and Juliets need only log into an internet porn site to “get that tiger.”  


**9. Internet porn is everywhere.**  


Anywhere there is wi-fi there is porn  


If one types “internet porn sites” into Google, there are more than 23 million hits. Some of the results are “top lists” of other sites. Others are entries in online encyclopedias that explain the prevalence and effect of such sites. A great many are the actual sites themselves. According to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, more than 5 billion work hours are lost annually because people are searching for or watching porn.  


People can watch it on their phones or tablets. They don’t even need to be in their own homes. If someone uses headphones and keeps his or her tablet in his or her lap while sitting at a restaurant table, it would be impossible to see what that person is watching without actually leaning over him or her in a very rude manner. Watching porn in a public area also ties back to No. 10 because it’s “taboo” to do things like that. Why else is there a “mile-high club” for frequent air travelers?  


With the advent of free WiFi in many public spaces, such porn watching won’t even leave a record of you having watched it. Even though it’s everywhere, it’s still possible to be secretive about watching it.  


**8. It feeds a basal need for power.**  
Porn can provide a rush of power  


From time to time, everyone feels powerless. When it comes to men who are unsuccessful with women or men, depending on their preference, that feeling of powerlessness feeds a growing anger. Men who experience such anger sometimes objectify women and men in their quest to have power over them. Of course, these men cannot act out the aggression in real life because such behavior is criminal. Although some men do cross the line into the realm of the criminal, most turn elsewhere for their sexual release.  


Porn provides these men an opportunity to scream obscenities at the computer screen and pretend they’re talking dirty to a flesh-and-blood woman or man. They imagine the object of their desire and derision in suggestive poses. It’s a very short step, too, to imagine them begging for “sexual release” that only the porn watcher can provide.  


Power itself can be addictive. In some cases, the lust for power is as strong as a cocaine addiction. The porn becomes the tool for that person to exercise power in a way that’s safe and secret. The stereotype of the “pervert in his mom’s basement” is a good example of the kind of powerlessness that breeds a porn addiction.  


Whether the viewer is a man who believes women should be dominated and humiliated, a closeted gay man dealing with feelings of self-loathing imposed on him by society and who is looking to lash out in private, or anything else in between, porn gives a feeling of power.  


**7. People are just horny.**  


Sex is a biological need  


John DeLamater and Rebecca F.  


Plante performed a survey study in 2014 regarding the reasons people watch porn. Of the four responses that yielded enough statistical significance to be characterized by the study, “I was horny,” was at the top of the list.  


Men and women both get horny often enough that there will come a time in their lives, even if they’re involved with a significant other at some point when they just want to “get off.” Maybe the person has a particularly erotic thought before getting in the shower, and the person’s partner has already gone off to work. All that person has to do is queue up a video from any of a number of websites, watch it, and “take care of business” in the shower. The more often the person feels horny, the more often the person can turn to internet porn for release. When something like porn is easily accessible, it’s possible for that “something” to progress to addiction. When a lot of people all over the world get horny, it can easily become an epidemic of internet porn addiction.  


**6. It’s easy to fulfill one’s fantasies.**  


Porn fuels fantasy  


Even if someone isn’t on a quest for power, it’s very easy to indulge one’s fantasies in the world of internet porn. If someone likes the “naughty nurse” look, for example, more than a million images are just one Google search away. If videos are the order of the day, then there are more than 350,000 from which to choose. Brian Boyd, Joseph Carroll, and Jonathan Gottschall, in their, pretends that the women are underage, is the only way to avoid jail time.  


The thrill of such “taboo” items can quickly become addictive. For example, in the same way as “adrenaline junkies” become addicted to high-risk adventures, internet porn addicts whose fantasies are controversial or even illegal can live vicariously through the performers on the screen.  


Furthermore, people who are repressed sexually can investigate and explore other fantasies and aspects of their sexuality simply by browsing short videos on any one of the more than 4 million porn websites on the internet. The freeing nature of such explorations can also contribute to the overall addiction to porn.

He's had some moments of sobriety but I don't think he's been clean for more than a few weeks at most. 

 Recently, he got into some serious legal trouble because of other drugs (cocaine, fake Xanax) I didn't know he was using. He says he was using them 2-3 times a week. Now that things are escalating (from weed to coke and fake Xanax) I've been seriously trying to get him into some kind of therapy to see a professional who specializes in addiction  but he refuses. He claims he wants to change and seems sincere about it but is adamant he can do it all on his own. He also refuses to acknowledge that he has anxiety or a drug problem (he thinks that because he's not using *right now* that there are no problems). 

My concern is that he'll eventually relapse and get into more trouble (legal and otherwise) if his addiction issues and whatever's underlying them aren't treated. How do I convince my brother he needs professional help?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9967250227928162}"

You will find it if you’re happy with yourself.

Don’t ever accept nothing less from anyone who isn’t adding to your happiness, or anyone who you can’t trust with your feelings, matching your energy and absolutely loving who you are and stays when things are really difficult.

I have delt with addiction before and I know I have one at the moment even if I choose to decline the fact. I don't have a physical addiction like I did with opiates, but more of a mental one. I crave stimulants when not on them and get very bored quick and easily distracted. The drug has its many benefits, but I know the unhealthy negatives that come with them. I know that I have to weigh the positive effects with the negative effects, and I do, giving me more than one epiphany in the past 3 years where i decide I rather be physically healthy. 

I just continue to fall into the same cycle, even after being happy while clean and less anxious. I also become less active. Physically and mentally. I am planning on starting to exercise and get into meditation. I also am planning on treating my ADD with medical pot. Weed really helps me with my ADD ADHD, but it's only legal with a medical licence here in New York. The problem is it is mostly prescribed for pain relief and cancer treatment along with some very other bad illnesses. I know of people who have gotten a script for mental disabilities in other states, but thats after trying everything else pharmaceutical companies can provide you.

I have been addicted to weed for about two years (?) I dont really know. I've been clean for more than 4 months now thanks to the amazing support of my boyfriend who is also dealing with his addiction. he's half a year clean if I'm correct. 

I just struggle a lot with falling back. I have vacation right now after working for a long time and with the free time on my hands and me dealing with also trying to get off of my medication for my GAD (diazepam) which is something I've been on for about 9 months now (which you should actually only be on for about 3 months) at a really high doses I'm struggling a lot. 

lowering my dosage takes a high toll on my mental well being, it makes me hallucinate (not really horrible), it makes me exhausted, anxious, suicidal and depressed. I just want to light a joint and stop my life for a bit and just step out of all of it. I've had a lot of trauma in my life, of which a lot has been really recent (past year up until now). 

I do have a psychologist and have had a few the past years and they all suck a*s (I'm going to file a complaint when I'm finished with my treatment) and am not getting the right treatment. I do want to start emdr when I'm finally off of my medication. 

I've just had a really hard time, I have an addicted brother with adhd and autism which has caused me a lot of trouble in my life and traumatised me quite a bit. I've also been in a relationship before my current boyfriend with a horrible compulsive lying narcissistic guy who fed my addiction, used me for my money and sex and mental support and I just haven't been able to talk to anyone about it. 

I have friends but my anxiety just makes it really difficult to reach out and I cant really talk about my ex with my bf because I dated him before then dumped him because I wanted to stop using weed and then got together with his best friend (the narcissist), which didnt help me stop using. a bit of a situation you can tell.

I was a total bitch to her, the last few months of her life.

On October 30th, 2019, I watched her casket lowered 6 feet under, and that night I shot up for the first time. 

I just got worse from then on, and how the tables turned looking back in retrospect. I'm the very thing I loathed with a fucking passion.

I was in denial and lost most of the time (from 2015 to 2020). Now I'm 208 days weed free and 162 days cigarette free (thanks to the lockdown too). I sold my speakers, gold ring, and power bank to support my addictions. I took loan from friends too. Some I have paid by stealing from dad's account and some I have to still pay. College was expensive too, I anyhow completed a degree with low grades and no interest, didn't have a good relationship with my teachers. Good student up until school, after that a mediocre student in college. Mostly D's in my college report card (except for practicals because I liked doing them). Like I had ongoing stress due to ignorance and during my 3rd to 4th year I mostly went to my friends without any self esteem just to smoke weed and get the high. 

Many times abused weed despite having paranoia once (it was very potent). I don't have any industry relevant skills, highly unemployable, criminal tendencies (because I'm broke as hell). Still dependent on my parents (which feels so shameful, I'm afraid of getting shunned by them and I'm afraid of consequences as well, I'm a coward). From 2012 to 2020, I have achieved nothing significant. I have a poor mentality. I'm in fucking debt. I hate myself.

As in with rapid memory loss, I still have it (maybe it's because I masturbate, that adds to it). My social anxiety is also because of the substances I abused. Like the problem with me is I abuse weed, alcohol cigarettes and masturbation irresponsibly. My dad is pissed off with me and he shows me tough love (though I get easily pissed off as I'm also good for nothing). I'm also suffering my ignorance. I don't know for most part what's going on in the country and the world (like about the economy, human achievements, in general, important news). 

I would often drink myself to the point where I'll puke. Just to the point of death.

In college, I used to be the uninvited guy in college who would just go to his friends' place(s) to have fun time smoking weed, to drink, or to eat food. There were many times I didn't have any pocket money, as I would blow so much on cigarettes (cigarettes are expensive too). 

I have lied for it as well, as they say, lying requires a lot of mental efforts. And my lies have made me incapable of even doing simple tasks in life.

I don't remember important dates and happenings of my life. I have basically programmed my mind to remember all the bad things I did to people, my family, as well as for myself. And so many people in my life have tried giving valuable advice to me, and I ignored them just because I gave so much importance to weed. I have achieved nothing in my life, and I don't have a good relationship with my family as well.

Sometimes I feel someone should point a gun on my head or I should catch the coronavirus. I have the emotional maturity of a child.

## Abstract

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation used to treat a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, but is still in the early stages of study as addiction treatment. We identified 19 human studies using repetitive TMS (rTMS) to manipulate drug craving or use, which exposed a total of 316 adults to active rTMS. Nine studies involved tobacco, six alcohol, three cocaine, and one methamphetamine. The majority of studies targeted high-frequency (5–20 Hz; expected to stimulate neuronal activity) rTMS pulses to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Only five studies were controlled clinical trials: two of four nicotine trials found decreased cigarette smoking; the cocaine trial found decreased cocaine use. Many aspects of optimal treatment remain unknown, including rTMS parameters, duration of treatment, relationship to cue-induced craving, and concomitant treatment. The mechanisms of rTMS potential therapeutic action in treating addictions are poorly understood, but may involve increased dopamine and glutamate function in corticomesolimbic brain circuits and modulation of neural activity in brain circuits that mediate cognitive processes relevant to addiction, such as response inhibition, selective attention, and reactivity to drug-associated cues. rTMS treatment of addiction must be considered experimental at this time, but appears to have a promising future.",2,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.779373288154602}"

I arrived at work today, late, at 8:15 AM, because my Uber took longer than expected to arrive.  This being a result of my failure to plan accordingly and my revoked license.  The revoked license, is simply a consequence of my poor choices.

At roughly 11:00 AM, I received a call from my roommate (one of two roommates that are in active recovery) telling me to find a place that I can be away from other people.  I NEVER expected what I was about to hear.  

He proceeds to tell me \*Dominick\* overdosed last night..  ------  He's dead

He had over 3 years clean.  Completed countless programs, was an advocate for clean living among several different establishments.  

As I'm writing this I'm reminded of my journey and everything that came along with it.  People telling me the exact same thing, I'm writing now.  

Before being made aware of all of this, at 11:00 AM this morning...  About one month ago.  I noticed a certain level of communication beginning to diminish -- in addition to some (what I feel) clear indicators...  So I reached out the best I could without being too intrusive.

I’ve been with my partner for 3 years and we live together with his family. His brother has been addicted to heroine before I ever entered the picture and I’ve had other family members battle addiction as well so his behaviors didn’t come as a surprise. 

Since entering the picture, he’s been in and out of jail, has stolen from us, and even wound up in the hospital near death a little over a month ago with sepsis. He’s very sweet and considerate when he’s sober, but his addiction doesn’t allow him to be himself. His families way of coping, is turning a blind eye when it comes to his drug use. He will stay in the bathroom for hours and after his recent release, he gave up heroine and moved on to pills (not sure which exact kind) that he smokes. I only know this because I find tinfoil in the restroom and due to a new issue we’ve been experiencing, which is that the smell has wafted out of the bathroom to surrounding rooms on a few occasions. I’m finding it very hard to follow his family in turning a blind eye and am beginning to build up resentment but am not sure how to approach it because it feels it’s not my place and I also don’t want to make him feel alienated or that he can’t come home. It’s also hard because his family comes to me for advice on the issue and I know they want to stop enabling him, but they don’t have it in them to stop giving him money, a place to sleep, etc.

This morning he turned up here after a week of being gone and decided to go into the master bath to do his drug and my younger sister in law (only 12 years old) was asleep in the master bedroom. I heard her calling out my partner and my name since her mom isn’t home and I ran to the room only to be met by a very strong odor. I immediately got a headache and we took her out of the room. We knocked on the door and told his brother that it “smelled weird” and that was the full extent of where things went. The issue is, this isn’t the first time this has happened. The last time he smoked in the restroom with her in the bedroom next to him, she woke up throwing up due to the odor. This is my second time getting a headache because I’m very sensitive to smell as well. It’s very frustrating for me because I find it hard to continue ignoring it when a child is being impacted by his decisions and no one is stepping in to stop it. I wanted to yell so badly at him today and tell him he needs to leave but I knew it would only make things worse for him but he doesn’t seem to be at the stage where he wants help. My family took a very tough love approach towards my family in kicking them out/ not allowing them to come around as I grew up to  protect me and my siblings from being exposed to that so it’s so hard for me not to step in to do the same. What do I even do??? His family loves him but his behavior is tearing them apart and I’m tired of sitting around and watching it happen. I have no idea what’s best.

I don’t want to do this,"Hoping someone here has advice how to get through this mental torment. I fell in love with my boyfriend earlier this year. When we met he had just hit 1 year clean. He was in a sober living at the time, I had 9 months (I now have over a year). We hit it off immediately and got really attached to each other very quickly. Being addicts we just dove right in. May not have been the right thing to do, but it felt right at the time. I've never felt this way before about someone. I love him so much, it's an indescribable feeling. Like we have known each other before, he feels like home, we understand each other. Felt like he was my person, I honestly don't think about anyone else. I love being around him and talking to him for hours. We have everything in common and he made me happier than I ever have been. But a lot happened...

A month into the relationship, seemingly going very well, he moved in with me (out of sober living) when the quarantine started. We thought at the time this would be way shorter than what it has come to. I was thinking in my head, I'm falling in love with this guy and want to spend 1-2 weeks with him. But, *he relapsed the day he moved into my place*, back into active addiction again for 2 months. I can't help but feeling like that was a betrayal after letting him into my home. And put my sobriety in jeopardy. Obviously a lot changed in our relationship and I saw the completely different side of him. He's such an incredible person when he's sober. The sober him, I want in my life. So badly. But the amount of lies, torment, and bad treatment I went through with his addiction really fucked me up. My mind won't let me believe anything he says anymore. I'm in constant paranoia. I want to so badly but I just can't right now. He moved back home across the country and has now has 2 weeks sober. That genuine laugh is back, that person I fell in love with is slowly returning. He isn't in outpatient or anything and only going to a few zoom meetings a week. I just keep worrying about his sobriety and if he'll be okay.

It was so hard feeling like I lost him for several months, and now that he is getting better and so far away, I'm heartbroken. He's obviously in the very early stages of sobriety and extremely fragile. He feels so horrible and keeps apologizing for everything. He wants me to give him once last chance. And I forgive him, but so torn. I don't know if he's coming back here. I don't know what the future holds. His ride with opiates has been 10 years+ , in and out of sober livings. I don't know if I could go through another relapse. I broke up with him last night and I feel so fucking sad. I don't want to do this. But something in my gut is telling me to. It's such a head over heart decision and my mind won't stop fucking with it. I want to be there for him, I have so much faith in him, but it drained the life out of me when he was here. He wants to marry me and have kids with me and all I can think about is this happening again in the future with higher circumstances like that. Especially so early on in getting to know him. I want him to get better on his own, and not feel like he needs me to be able to do this. I even told him my heart will always be open to him down the line once he gets his life back on track. He said the reason he is staying sober is for me, but he has to do it for himself. 

I feel so horrible for breaking up with him but I'm trying to put myself first. Which feels shitty for some reason. I have to realize I can't be his savior. I feel like we never got a fair chance. It's like I can't let go of wanting things to be different and not facing reality. Staying with him, I'm scared of what might happen. I would do anything for him, and that I think that's what scaring me. I lost myself only caring about him. Leaving him, I'm scared that I'm giving up on him, what if I can help him finally get through this once and for all. I do love him so much and feel that confident in our connection. this decision is killing me. God this fucking sucks.",1,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.5172712206840515}"

Might help some younger people to realize how fucked up drugs and alcohol can make you. 

First drug I used was at 16. Dip. I enjoyed the buzz. Distracted from day to day life. I was a depressed person from my very early teens. Second drug I tried was Salvia. Holy shit! That was intense. I did it a couple more times, nothing too special. Third drug I tried was weed. Made me anxious as fuck at first, but holy fuck I loved it. That was the first drug I truly loved. Only had reliable access through my brother, and I would take every chance in hell to smoke with him. 

After a year of being a stoner, I moved out of state. Weed got boring, and I got a new job. I would do shrooms and weed from time to time. Loved shrooms and still do, although I never use them. Eventually, I got kidney stones and was prescribed hydrocodone. Between that and shrooms, that was probably the greatest feeling I’d ever had. Only difference was, with hydros I could take them every day and still seem normal. They really seemed like a temporary cure to my depression. I was almost instantly hooked. My friend from work (my first job) had a hookup who would sell hydros and oxys. I considered both drugs to be amazing, and eventually got to the point where I was using them every day. I would have mild to moderate withdrawals if I stopped. 

After awhile, I started started stealing coupons from the grocery store I worked at. The coupons would give you 5 dollars off your order, so I could basically get free lunch every day. This was all because I had no money to get anything else besides my hydros and oxys. Of course, my work caught on and had camera footage of me taking coupons that were supposed to be for customers. I was let go. 

Second job I ever had was Panera Bread. Hated that place. Only time I could bear working there is if I was opiated. Well, eventually my parents and my girlfriend found out about my opiate use, and I had to quit using or else! Withdrawal was too much to handle, so I quit because my job was making me crazy while going through withdrawals.

Third job is Pizza Hut. Damn, I loved that place. Free pizza all the time, just get to cruise around in my car getting tips. Oh, and I developed a baaaaad poppyseed habit before this job. This was the first time I would get deathly sick if I quit, not just a little nauseous, anxious and cold. These withdrawals felt like I was in hell. Anyways, when I started working at Pizza Hut I found a Heroin and Cocaine hook up. Damn, I was so happy. I’d only done heroin once before and I loved it, and I never even had tried coke before. Coke was ehh... whatever. But heroin was the holy grail! Within days, I was shooting up everyday. Going to the downtown projects every night to score. It was somewhat cheap at first, but it got expensive pretty quickly. Stealing money from my parents and using every last dime I had on heroin, cocaine and gas. Thankfully, I was only on heroin for a year, started using Kratom, cut off my friends and I was good to go! Amazingly, I still had my Pizza Hut job. 

I was doing ok for several years, just mainly taking Kratom and occasionally klonopin that I was prescribed. I quit delivery, started working at a church, and it was a great job. 

After all that time of having a good job and a pretty good life, I started drinking. I drank once with klonopin and realized I actually enjoyed it. I hadn’t drank for probably a year or 2 just because I had no desire to. So, of course, drinking became a problem. I was getting hammered at work. I would often have a huge cocktail of drugs while drinking. Alcohol, Kratom, Barbituates, Ambien, Benzos and sometimes computer duster. Name your mix. Amazingly, none of my coworkers ever seemed to notice me being fucked up while I was at work. And I mean blackout, passing out in my car, don’t remember how I got there type thing. Well, I ended up getting found out, and I quit because of the humiliation. Everyone knew, and it was a church. I was ashamed. 

Job after that, first time I drank on the job they noticed. Got fired. That was about 2 weeks in. Next job, drank on the job, blacked out, ended up getting sent to the ER, I quit. Next job was a delivery job. I blacked out several times on the job, eventually got into a couple accidents, got sent to the ER, I got let go. Next job, I worked there for 9 months. Not too bad. I had 100 days sober under my belt, then drank. It was on the job (of course) and I was fired. That sums up my work history, guys. I am now self employed, and I’m doing okay. Thanks for asking.

As of 2 days ago I've been completely clean.

Day 1) wasn't bad I had some energy to do things but I'm guessing it's because the amphetamines are still in my system.

Day 1-N) during night time I felt drained as if I just finished a long day of wrestling or martial arts practice, I took a shower and slept at around 1 am (took melatonin).

Day 2) I wokeup at 8 pm, I drank coffee and tried to study a little bit, after doing about 10 minutes of studying I gave up and tried playing video games. after playing for maybe an hour I felt as if I was doing very bad compared to how I usually play (I play competitively).

Day 2-N) I stayed up to around 3 am until I started feeling tired, I did my usual routine of trying to sleep. at aprox 4 am I was awaken to a urge to do something with my life, I woke up and ate something and after about 15 minutes the urge completely went away and I began to feel tired again, however these random energy boosts kept me up until 7 am.

Day 3) I woke up at 8 am again. I've been very depressed and over all feeling hopeless. I haven't talked to most of my friends for about a 2 month period. There is for sure a regretful feeling. After about 1 hour of waking up and drinking coffee I'm feeling very tired as if I haven't slept for 24 hours.

Day 3-N) it's 11 pm currently and I'm feeling extremely tired. I want to go to sleep just to hope I feel better tomorrow. at this point I feel extremely depressed and I'm thinking about my past.

Day 4 - I skipped writing in this journal but things were going a little better after drinking coffee, mostly good sleep

I know it may not sound or be anywhere close to being addicted to some heavy stuff but I am here because for the past 2 or 2.5 years I have been addicted to a cough syrup.

I took it for the first time when i developed a moderate to severe case of tonsilitis at the start of 2018. That first night, it made me feel so wound up and nervous and had my heart racing so much that i was unable to sleep. And yet, I discovered I loved the feeling. Long story short, from the start of 2018 to present day, I have gone from one 100ml bottle a week to one (plus a small amount from another one) 125ml bottle each night. 

The medication in question is a cough syrup whose main/active ingredients include diphenhhdramine (12mg per 5ml) and codeine phosphate (10mg per 5ml). I researched these components and i know all of the risks ans dangers (I also realized I enjoy learning about pharmacology things) but I always felt i had it under control. 

The stuff is not cheap so my finances also suffered because i was spending my money on this too often. One day, I could not find the medication anywhere and I was out. So i decided that Benadryl will work just the same. It didn't. I tried many other cough syrups with diphenhydramine as their main component but i never got the feeling that the other one gave me. Thats when i realized that it was the combo of the 2 that did the trick (codeine-only products just made me so sleepy that i sometimes had out of body experiences). 

I took this to help me sleep. I suffer from insomnia and this was my solution. This is how i rationalized the whole thing but I was lying to myself since the diphenhydramine gave me paradoxical symptoms and i actually only ever slept for 2-3 hours a night because it made me too excitable. My heart would race, my skin would itch and my mouth would get dry. But i loved every second of it. 

One day i found a new coigh syrup that had even more diphenhydramine and codeine in it and it was cheaper! Jackpot! At this point, here are my issues ;
1. I am 25f and i sleep 2 hours a night. 
2. I am living paycheck to paycheck because of this habit.
3. I live in a small country and I rotate around 3 places from where I purchase the stuff and I know the cashiers have noticed.
4. At any given time, I have at least 20 bottles hidden throughout my room. 
5. I hardly ever have an appetite anymore.

I have become so dependent on the stuff that if night is approaching and I dont have any, I get extremely nervous. I promised myself i would quit on Tuesday (after many previous failed attempts) and on wednesday i convinced myself that i needed it and promised myself it would be the last time. Guess what i just did............ yup, i went out and got more. I took a small sip a while ago and instantly felt sick. Maybe it was mind over matter but i cannlt be sure.

Can anyone help me get over this thing? Dr-patient confidentiality is not a thing where i am from and i am beyond embarrassed. No one in my family has a clue and i am struggli ng with this. I apologize for the length of the post, but it felt good to actually write it all down.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9962300658226013}"

&#x200B;

So my husband (24M)  has been struggling with some questions for the last months/year...

&#x200B;

I can't say much about how things were before we met, but since I came into his life (2 years today) it has always been really rough, in an emotional rollercoaster...

&#x200B;

His problems are most with alcohol and cocaine (and benzodiazepines a bit less frequently).

When we met, he was already 10 months clean. He was even happy about it, tracking everyday and so on. He was in a very depressed mood generally (he suffers from depresion so it comes from time to time). I could watch the depresion developing on the next weeks. He was really bad. Then he started to say he wasn't being himself, that he needed friends to hang out (but actually he just wanted an excuse to drink), and even if he doesn't notice, he makes it seem that the only way he can be himself agai is by drinking. Some days later, the first relapse. He drank and used cocaine. For the following months, it happened a lot of times, always a different apology for it to have gone bad (like he wasnt feeling good, or the most stupid things, just not to admit he can't drink). He is not the kind who drinks every day, but when he does, it is a LOT. Always beer. He would spend the whole night drinking (and using some coke as well) and then feel bad the day after (and pretend nothing happened after that). One of the biggest problems is his ""will to take risks"" when drunk. He would do really dangerous things to get some drugs or to be able to drink more. Things escalated a lot after some episodes and he went to rehab. Spent less time there than he should, but he seemed to have changed how he felt about it. He was constantly saying he couldn't drink and stuff, but after some more time, all went back to ""normal"". He was feeling unhappy and could only be himself if drank. He was also always bragging about the fact that most people at the rehab used way much more than him and complaining that me and his doctor shouldn't have checked him in, that it was an exaggeration. He had some very bad episodes and went to rehab twice more (both times he was commited only 10% of the time he should). On the last time things went better. We decided to move out of town (he was afraid of being too close to drugs and alcohol here) and we were with his parents during the quarentine. Then he was depressed again, decided we wouldn't move out anymore and we went back to our old house. It lasted a bit more, but a couple weeks ago he started to drink again. Like always, too much. He didn't have drugs on the first time but I know he bought some on the second time and even after that he left at night to search somewhere to buy more drugs and only came back at dawn.

But he is a bit different now. He is not acting like his habits are dangerous (and he insists that his drinking habits are absolutely fine, always comparing to people he lived with, or even his family (that has a LOT of heavy alcoholism cases), saying that only the drug is the problem but, even after the last times when there was drugs involved, he didn't seem guilty. He makes jokes about it, always talks about drinking. He is obssessed with it. Even desperate to find some ""friends"" to go to their homes or have them here, because he just wants a reason to drink. I am constantly reporting to his psychiatrist, but I am also afraid of getting too involved in their doctor-pacient relation. I am trying to make he have an appoitment with the doctor quick (before things get too bad, again) but I am also afraid he will not be totally honest to the doctor and minimize things, because that doctor is really strict when it comes to his addictions, but the therapist always treated like it wasn't a big issue (everybody around my SO also said it almost looks like the therapist is encouraging his drinking since he neglects it a lot). The doctor told me he will recommend a change to a strict therapist that treats addiction, but I am afraid he will feel reluctant and won't even consider stopping from now.

&#x200B;

What should I do? I already told him I won't be around when he drinks because I don't want it to look that I accept it and also to protect my own feelings. We argued a lot because of this. I don't know how things will go from here, I just want to be emotionally ""protected""  not to be shocked when things go wrong again.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983276724815369}"

It all started when I was 12-13, when I started masturbating (a lot, like multiple times a day). Then some cigarettes, then in college I was abusing cigarettes, weed, alcohol and masturbation. All I did during 16-23 was nothing, with no skills and didn't learn anything in college as well. Have mostly D's in my marksheet. Also, I completed my degree in 5 years instead of 4. Wasn't eligible for almost every company of my field of study. Took the opportunities I had for granted. Wasted a lot of parents' hard earned money on coaching classes too, that I obviously bunked to abuse weed and alcohol. 

Also I was having high sexual desires in my adolescence, and desperate to have sex. Like I'm mostly suffering my ignorance. I don't read newspaper, don't shower and brush regularly. I'm a complete mess.

I've read in a study that smoking weed continuously for 60-90 days results in a loss of 8 IQ points, that is irreversible. Seems true in my case as well. I'm in my 20's now, hopeless, broke and somewhat depressed. Everybody was saying I was a man of high potential, but time is everything. I was mostly an 'A' student until 12-13. After that I started spoiling my own life. I was looking for shortcuts for success. I was and still fascinated by rap music, the reason why I stopped studying. I was and still having grandiose opinions about myself.

But people with good grades and a high-paying job can follow their passion much easier than someone like me, who's completely lost in life right now. And still living with parents, jobless and unemployable. I have never got a scholarship in my life as well. College and coaching classes were expensive too. I'm a moron and a spoiled brat as well. No one would marry me as I have no money. These addictions have added no value to my life. I am a skewed intelligence. I haven't done any good to anyone in my life. I have overdosed on alcohol thrice in my life. My health is dangerously fucked too.

I don't intend to give an example or something like that, I just want to share my story. I'm unable to love my parents for whatever they have done and are still doing for me. It's quite odd that they still love me, but I'm unable to reciprocate that.

P.S. : I have sold items, stole money from parents and good friends of mine, and took debt from friends last year to support my weed addictions. Like I don't even trust myself. I'm a damn issue by myself, unable to handle my own life.

Now, I'm 204 days weed free and 159 days cigarette free. I don't remember when I drank last, but it was (beer + whiskey + weed + cigarettes + porn). And it was horrible, I puked. And even after quitting I don't feel my life has changed ever since. Because the brain damage and loss of motivation still exist in me. I was using these to just have fun and waste time and just jack off under the influence.

The pleasure molecule. No matter what you do you do it for dopamine. Eating, peeing, smoking meth, you name it. Dopamine is involved.

Now each person has his/her own ""dopamine average"" which is the standard set by their lifestyle. Each the reason a when a rich guy says he is OK, he feels the same as when a normal guy says it despite living radically different lives. It's also the reason that, for example, a heroin addict eventually ends up using just to feel normal. That's because your body seeks balance

On the other hand if you do something that launches your dopamine through the roof like getting completely wasted, then after that you get a massive dopamine drop (the hangover and the crash)

So what is the solution?

By lowering your dopamine average, which can be done through detoxing and living a low maintainable lifestyle in general, you can potentially set your OK feeling to just ""eat drink and sleep"". Now you don't need to get this low but you get the idea.

And as a bonus: Once you become stable you can now enjoy some of life's natural highs even more so than the average Joe!

 2. Under another account I asked for help on an unrelated sub a while ago. Only mention this because I'm very uncomfortable with exposing my feelings and needs, and even while asking for support on the internet I'll find a way to justify and sabotage.
 Been in a rough spot, physically (I have permanent ailments) and mentally/emotionally.

Thought because I did something decent it wouldn't bother me, but I felt really down about life after seeing someone with the same clutch.

I ate edible hash and smoked a big spliff with my mates, after that I felt completely disconnected from reality, like my vision was blurry didn't even register where I was. When I got home I lay down on my bed and I couldn't think at all like my memory and cognitive ability was completely fucked, felt almost brain damaged like I hit my head or something. And I had this almost demonic hallucination in my vision of a typical old man coke heads face and said  ""cor give us some coke"" (I can laugh at it now but at the time it was really scary) and my thoughts were remembering back to meeting every coke head and I was super paranoid I had infected my DNA perminately with coke.

After that my dreams were seriously vivid and scary, and for the last 3 and a half weeks I've been super paranoid, un able to articulate myself or concentrate. It's hard to tell if it's paranoia or if I have actually done some permanent damage to my cognitive ability. 

I'm feeling better as the days go on, but still don't feel myself or normal at all. I'm pretty sure this coke was cut a lot with speed (amphetamines), speaking to a mate that knows about coke he said speed burns your sinuses a lot which mine were fucked from this coke. Also the guy that sold me it gave it to this girl that knows her coke and said this is cut with amphetamines and chucked it back at him and told him to never call her again haha.

This has never happened to me before usually I'm ok just tired for a few weeks (usually I do a half g so 1g is a big dose for me) Safe to say I won't dare touch Cocaine ever again, does this experience sound familiar to any of you guys? will I return to normal? any advice would help. I'm hoping I'm just paranoid.

Im still heavily addicted to weed and alcohol and fentanyl. I have battled with a life ruining cocaine addiction ontop for over a year, and when I havent been on cocaine, I was in an abusive relationship with a crazy woman, who discarded me 15 times within 8 months. She would make it up to me with insane love and sex each time, and I was definately using her as an addiction.

She cut me off and discarded me 8 months ago, except this time was different. This time she completely ignored me afterword in every way - which tells me she had found someone else. Especially because the argument that caused the discard was beyond stupid.

In this 8 months without her, Ive been on and offf cocaine. My cocaine addiction has een heavily reliant on my terrible dealer getting it to me, and in the past month, I actually gave up trying.

Now, funny thing is, during this 8 months I tried to contact her multiple times, and was always ignored. A few days ago, I texted her ""hey"" and tthen began what appears to be her acting like nothing at all happened. Being flirty even, telling me shes single. I know for a fact that she is right there for the taking now, and all she is is anotherr addiction.

Im more afraid of the consequences of getting back with her than even thinking about the good part, just like with cocaine.

So for the last few days, Ive been trying as hard as I can to resist getting back with her, as I know exactly how it will end. Then today, low and behold, my dealer calls me, and tells me he is happy to drop me off 4grams of cocaine today which I can pay back in a few weeks, which I can...

Ive been tring to forget about this abusive relationship for the past 8 months. Ive been battling cocaine just as hard. Now Ive got both of them offered to me? I know even if I just take the coke, then that will lead me to calling her. Right infront of me sits the chance to ruin my entire life even more than I have already, and do it all over again. Why did I even live the last 8 months, just to go back where I started?

Ive never been able to say or turn her down, and its the same for the cocaine. I really hope I can do it this time. I really really dont want it. All I have to do is avoid those 2 things (the rest can be tackled later) and then I can atleast not end my year in hospital or with a broken heart.",0,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9870139360427856}"

Little background:

I am a high achiever and have a very promising career ahead of me, tons of support and help behind me, but I am hopelessly drug addicted. Lost everything last year, my gf, apartment, job, almost kicked out of school. Became homeless. Spent the whole year in psychiatric institutions, detox. Felt as though it was the only way to redeem myself of losing my girlfriend, getting sober. But even with all the meds and help, I am in constant pain. After 3 months sober, I was basically in a coma, slept for weeks without waking up, waking up and immediately forced back into sleep by the pain. When the meds still dont work, I feel one has to find an alternative, or else its suicide. Tried everything from Yoga to Iboga and Ayahuasca, and I'm still here, drowning in darkness.

I have learnt that I always need to be intoxicated. I need to be highly functional and while on drugs. Is there anybody who has made this work? I have to ditch my old daily drug cocktail (tramadol, clonazepam, modafinil, morphine, alcohol, cigarettes, weed) because it became very problematic. Looking for a new one, more sustainable. Curious if there are others like me who maybe made it work.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983178377151489}"
