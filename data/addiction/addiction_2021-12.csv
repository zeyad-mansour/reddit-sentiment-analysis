I‚Äôm only about to turn 21 but I have not been living to the standard that I feel like I should be living. Currently in college and been antisocial, lethargic, not eating enough, lazy, stress, anxiety, and dealing with addictions. I pretty much want to address every one of these problems but know it‚Äôs going to take a lot of willpower and discipline.

I have a list of resolutions I want to achieve in 2022 (I‚Äôm only using Jan 1st as the day of actually being serious because I want to use New Years Eve as my final farewell to my filthy addictions), so let me hear your thoughts on it and let me know what you‚Äôre trying to achieve for the new year.

2022 RESOLUTIONS:

- no weed
- no nicotine
- limit caffeine consumption 
- limit drinking to only special occasions
- no porn or masterbation
- wake up early everyday
- limit screen time to 2 hours per day (sometimes I would get 10 hours of screen time on bad days)
- workout 5 days of the week
- stay consistent with diet (add calories)
- read Bible daily and establish relationship with God
- no more procrastinating homework til last minute
- less cursing
- cold showers in the morning
- drink gallon of water daily
- take up new hobbies such as learning Korean and playing guitar

Sometimes when I am in a lot of physical pain I think about strong painkillers, and when I am going through a period of high stress or a low point, I think about taking something to take the edge off, but these are often passing thoughts. However, I seem to dream about them a lot. In my dreams I might be taking painkillers and everybody at work finds out I am high and then my parents find out and all hell breaks loose. I've dreamt about being homeless and meeting other homeless people and just abusing drugs with them. All dreams involving drugs seem to turn bad, so at least there's that... if I'm craving them at least it shows me the possible consequences to me ever taking them again.

It just worries me that my subconscious seems to think a lot more about my old vice than my conscious. I've not really come close to taking anything but I am lucky that temptation isn't there. I had a friend who took something in front of me and asked if I wanted some. I said no, but they were in the back of my mind the entire time I was there. Safe to say he isn't my friend anymore, as he was one of the only people in my life who knows about my past struggle with addiction and still offered them. Whenever something is brought up in conversation to do with specific substances I feel myself getting almost a little rush talking about them or thinking about them. I guess that's just part of the recovery, something that will never really go away.

Just wondering really, is it something I should be concerned with? Or are these just usual thoughts and feelings that arise from being a recovering addict? I have no plans to go out and buy drugs or find them, I just find myself thinking about them sometimes.",2

I've probably been addicted to THC for the past two years or so. Addicted to nicotine since 16 y/o I'd say as well as caffeine. I just need to vent. Haven't told anyone this honestly. 

I started smoking weed when I was a senior in high school and loved it of course and once I got to college I had the freedom to smoke all the time. I managed my freshman year alright but sophomore year it really got out of hand. Sophomore year was all greens and tobacco. The entire year was pretty much a fever dream. Skipping over a few major details of my life...in between then and now... this entire semester (junior year) I've somehow hidden this weed addiction. My friends are all stoners but are not the type to be high all day. I don't really smoke bud anymore myself and have been binging delta 8/10 THC devices from T-Shops and gas stations very frequently over pretty much the entire semester. Delta 8 doesn't get me as ""groggy"" as bud which is why I really like it. But obviously, if you've ever had both you know it can still get you pretty geeked. I have literally become dependent on this shit to function and I think the last time I've gone longer than a day without weed was this summer when I took a T. I'm writing this high, as a matter of fact. 

I have acknowledged my weed addiction for a considerable amount of time now. It's really hard to say because I've gone on and off. Regardless, I've been to therapy twice before, the first time I didnt even mention my use(this was freshman year summer), second time really helped and it got me out of a really really dark place. To say I havent made progress is a complete lie and in the grand scheme of things life is great. Addiction is my greatest vice I need to conquer because its controlling my life. But I never really got the root of the problem with my 2nd counselor. IDK...If anyone has made it this far I really appreciate you from the bottom of my heart as I sit here stoned in my feels. 

Long story short, I've been neglecting doing this for months, but earlier this month I reached out to my schools health services for my 3rd time. I was put on a waitlist for some weeks and ultimately scheduled for Jan. 13th. This time I am going to substance use therapy and I'm hoping to get great results as long as I put in the work. It is really frustrating and very sad the lack of resources we have in this area especially during this time and it really breaks my heart. Makes me want to become a counselor of some sort. But my ultimate point to all of this is man, I feel so lonely and lost. My family thinks Im better because I hide it very well but im smoking every day still and cant stop cuz I know ill withdrawal and itll be obvious so my plan is to wait until I go back to my house but I still have 2 weeks before I go to therapy and I feel like I will break everytime I think of stopping and just keep buying more it fucking blows. 

Here's me writing this as people struggle with addictions 10x worse than weed. I mean this shit hasn't even killed anyone on its own. I know i'm probably being a little bitch and complaining for no reason. After all, I am privileged, go to a uni, have access to mental health care, etc. etc. etc. and I'm on here whining about how long I have to wait to get a therapy session when there are people out here who dont even have access to resources like I do. Jesus christ, It's really like im having a conversation with myself at this point. Whatever I guess, not gonna proofread shit and just post lol if you've read all of this bullshit I apologize! 

TLDR

Cannabis use is bad, real bad... waiting on therapy, sucks ---- maybe I should realize other people are suffering way worse tho fuck me",2

I've used reddit in the past to ask some questions within my communities, but this one may be a bit out there. I'd appreciate some feedback, but as always it's ok to just keep scrolling.

I (20F) am the child of an alcoholic/addict father (61M). He has cirrhosis currently and has been to rehab twice (both forced through hospital-mandated therapy). He's been told he will eventually go into liver failure and seeing as how I'm kinda the only one in the family with his blood type, it's likely I'd be the go-to for a liver donation. I need some perspective. 

He is an abusive ass and I frankly dislike being around him at all. He makes me uncomfortable and fear for my safety all throughout my childhood and even now. He has anger outbursts, he may be extremely bipolar (he doesn't believe in therapy or any medical intervention unless it's an emergency), and the alcohol and drugs make it so much worse. He doesn't think he belongs in AA nor rehab or in court-mandated anger management (yes my entire family is banned from Pizza Hut because of him). He says he ""doesn't have a problem"" and that he's ""not like the others in AA/rehab"" because he ""can stop anytime he wants"". He used to chase me and my brother around with beer bottles trying to 'discipline' us. Anything we had in our hands he'd take and throw it (no matter if it was food or an electronic) and then blame us for 'breaking' it. Anytime my pets anger him, he'll either yells at them, manhandles them, or in a few instances- throw them. He monologs for HOURS and gets angry anytime someone doesn't listen or tries to respond.

Please let me know if its ok to go to an AA meeting, either now or sometime in the future. I won't try and pretend I know exactly what alcoholics/addicts are going through because I don't know (I've been in therapy for years to deal with my childhood trauma, but I think this might be a step I need to take to heal from my past). I just want to go at least once just see what it is like for others with this disease. I want to know people who actually want to get better and get rid of my fear of alcohol and drugs. Is this an OK thing to do? Will I be disrespecting anyone and their struggles if I go? 

PS- as a disclaimer, I don't look down on alcoholics/addicts, it's a debilitating disease and I will not once speak badly of them and their struggles.",3

They never tell you what the disease of addiction really does. The statements are general enough that I was never scared of drugs. ‚ÄúYou could die. Your family will be sad. You could ruin your life.‚Äù Those things aren‚Äôt threatening. The human mind will rationalize to a point of becoming the ‚Äòexception‚Äô to the rule. 

Of course I didn‚Äôt think drowning an identity crisis in booze and pills would have a ripple effect. We can‚Äôt know the future, so we have no idea the damage we could cause. I spent 6 years watching everything around me burn to the ground while I stayed cocooned in my warm fucking blanket of heroin haze. Even when I got out, my naivety led me to believe I could mend my life instantaneously. I was proven wrong. 

I‚Äôve been clean for 3.5 years and every moment has been harder than the last. I put the easiest things back together first and patted myself on the back. The more difficult things like relationships and trust loomed over me for a bit, but I ignored them. With time, I softened, and so did those around me. I am now closer to my parents and siblings than I ever was, and I couldn‚Äôt be more grateful.

My grandma got the harshest treatment while I was in my addiction. I used her for everything I could think of: money, a car, a place to sleep, someone to lash out at. She raised me and was always there for me, always held me while I cried or laughed right along with me‚Ä¶. And I repaid her by taking everything she had and giving nothing in return but heartache. Even when I was mending other relationships, I pushed hers aside. It was too heavy to face all that I had done to her. She had every right to be bitter about it, and the possibility of our relationship never returning to normalcy made me not want to approach it at all. 

A couple of weeks ago, I was told my grandma was in the hospital. She was always in the hospital, so I didn‚Äôt panic. She had covid, but my whole family beat Covid so that didn‚Äôt alarm me either. This woman was so resilient‚Ä¶ she had 13 stents put in her heart, got bronchitis every year, was always on 11 different medications and somehow still made it. The hospital wasn‚Äôt allowing visitors for Covid positive patients, and I hadn‚Äôt seen her since last Christmas anyways. When my mom told me she wasn‚Äôt doing well, I swallowed my pride and called her. 

We talked for about a half hour, said our I love yous, and hung up. I had no worries until I was told she got moved to a step down unit. Her oxygen levels weren‚Äôt rising, and she agreed to be put on a ventilator if needed. I didn‚Äôt call again‚Ä¶ I just couldn‚Äôt find the time. I wish I would‚Äôve called again. Two days later she was in ICU on a ventilator and I knew‚Ä¶

Early in the morning on Christmas Eve I got the call that she was gone. It felt like nothing around me was real. It still doesn‚Äôt feel real. There wasn‚Äôt enough time. I didn‚Äôt do enough from my end‚Ä¶ I shove my hurt down because I‚Äôm terrified to feel and then get the urge to drown it out with the very thing that brought me here to begin with‚Ä¶

If any of you ever need to talk, message me. I‚Äôm just ranting but this disease loves to isolate you. So I‚Äôm ranting to stay clean. And if anyone else need to do the same I will listen.",1

(First post),"Hey all. I‚Äôm struggling with some personal conflict and was wondering if you guys can help me with some insight.

When I was in 6th grade I started on pills. I didn‚Äôt really care what kind as far as uppers or downers, but my very first was Vicodin. I kept chasing hydros and adderall and the like until I hit high school and gained more autonomy and started smoking weed. I got high every chance I could. It became a daily habit in around 2013 when I went to college. In 2016, I had one semester left to finish my Bachelor‚Äôs degree and got arrested off campus for possession. I was suspended for a year and put on probation with drug testing, so I started drinking every day instead until I got off probation and finished my degree. Since then I‚Äôve battled with overuse of alcohol and weed to cope with negative emotions. 

Late 2020, I went through a breakup and started drinking HARD until June this year. I was reading Addictive Thinking by Abraham Twerski (I believe) and everything clicked. For years I‚Äôd been telling myself I‚Äôm driving myself crazy, no matter what drug I choose, it‚Äôs all the same for me: escape. I never thought of myself as an addict though. And I‚Äôm firm believe of treating individuals rather than symptoms, so even if I were an addict, there must be some underlying cause making me want to drink myself to death, right? But upon reading this book, it made sense and I stopped drinking and it wasn‚Äôt even hard. I stayed completely clean for three months when my close friend drank himself to death alone in his apartment. Three months of my sobriety to the day. I didn‚Äôt turn to the bottle, but I guess you could say I relapsed on the weed pretty heavy. 

It wasn‚Äôt until I graduated again (Masters in Clinical Mental Health) this very month that I touched alcohol again. My partner agreed that I could limit myself to 3 drinks, I did that and got almost drunk but was not interested. And since then‚Ä¶ I just feel like catching a buzz sometimes. I don‚Äôt have cravings, I don‚Äôt feel a need to cover any pain, and a I know I have support close by. I still have not been to the liquor store in six months, but sometimes I‚Äôm tempted to have a beer or a couple of shots after work or on weekends now.

What do you guys think? Is addiction/recovery/relapse something we self-proclaim? Could I be misguided? Am I just a dude who likes getting buzzed but should be mindful of my intentions? Or am I an addict looking for an opening for relapse? Either way, I think that my life is in a peaceful place right now.

TL:DR; I used for 14 years since I was twelve. I self-admitted addiction, got my life on track, and no longer feel the existential agony that I‚Äôve drowned for so long. But I still would like to get messed up, responsibly. What do?",3

I used recreationally in my early  twenties, but it was never a habit. About 2 years ago I turned the age my dad was when he died , I hadn't developed a memory or any meaningful coordination to remember anything about him. I went through a break up I never got over and worked in a bank as an analyst . I then just hit a point . This was just before COVID , I resigned the financial system is a horrible place that I see doing no goof in the world.  just before that I spent a year out of work . The thing about working in the industry is you either learn how to use the system or u get used by it , one guess where I am.
 I broke up with someone I was seeing because of my previous hang ups , and i didn't think it was fair that I let my situation be a burden to us both.
I actually planned to end my life by July. I stay with my mom and have one sibling and I kept it from them. Until well I realised I couldn't I was too scared . 
Additionally for 2 years now I shut out all friends , family .
My birthday a few days ago I've actually atleast made contact with some of the people who were important to me . 
But being able to hold any relationships are almost foreign to me , and yeah some are the drug but majority is life . 
 The major deal is , I initially used because it made me productive af . But that fades eventually, 

I find that my urge and craving has grown a much more sinister attitude.  You see as I found I'm way too much of a chicken to think of ending myself , but in a way that's  to quick . And I have been and instea7using pretty excessively S the hopes it will make my heart explode. I've been justifying it as my slow way of ending it .

I always feel like an outlier when people talk about addiction. I didn‚Äôt suffer from childhood trauma as a result of my parents or family or anything else really, I had very loving and understanding parents who wanted to help me and guide me through my addiction and honestly were awesome even before my addiction.

I was shot when I was 14 and it fucked me up badly, I already had anxiety and then on top of that I developed PTSD, depression and my anxiety doubled-over. Everyday felt like a struggle and the pain meds that they gave me in the hospital is what drove me to start abusing opioids when the therapy and counselling I was given didn‚Äôt feel like it was helping me. I was 14. Although I was hardly in full swing until I was 15. From the beginning I kept this from my parents because I didn‚Äôt want them to feel like I wasn‚Äôt making an effort with the therapy and I know they were struggling with guilt from the shooting. (It wasn‚Äôt their fault)

I feel like I was genetically predisposed to develop some sort of mental health issue or something, my dad was abused and developed mental health problems as a result, however (luckily) his experiences as a kid meant that he did absolutely everything to avoid making the same mistakes that his father did. 

Alongside that I also felt extreme pressure to adhere to social expectations of me at school since I was really smart and put into ‚Äúgifted‚Äù programs which aimed for students to excel. Coupled with the school shootings that happen all the time in this godforsaken country, it felt like I was in a never-ending spiral of anxiety and pain. I felt like I didn‚Äôt belong when I went to rehab or addiction meetings since all these other people had actual real problems such as childhood abuse, sexual trauma and other stuff. It just made me feel like it was all in my head. 

There‚Äôs a lot to unpack about it but I guess I just wanted to ask is there anyone else who‚Äôs addiction stems from more situational events? Sorry if this sounds ignorant or incredibly misinformed.

so now i am feeling pretty alone and isolated even though i am surrounded by people. they belong to other people and i feel like a burden or like i have butted in long enough. but i no longer have people. i do not really have friends, only former coworkers or people i have not seen or talked to in over a decade. and then the few people that i bribe to run errands with or they get stuck and feel obligated to help me (backed into a corner and feel they have no choice but to say yes if i ask them for something). do you know how sad and pathetic that is? because i seriously only recently became aware of how my life is and looks. i guess ignorance truly is bliss... unfortunately, my ""ignorances  of choice"" are no longer offering the bliss they once did.

i am terrified of change, i need structure and discipline however i behave like a young teenager if anyone tries to tell me what to do 
and Lord help us if anyone tries to take anything away from me...
i throw fits and act like a giant brat, or i just sob uncontrollably. 
i am aware of all this stuff now and its even more frustrating because i feel like i could offer me great advice but somehow i cannot accomplish anything to better my life or put forth any positive efforts to change. 
instant gratification and procrastination do not coexsist and yet those are two things that i seem to strive for.

Anyways, fast forward to now I am coming up on 8 months and honestly life has been amazing, rekindled marriage, better relationship with my daughters, new career, etc.

I went to the dentist last week and they let me know that 7 of my teeth are severely decayed and need to be pulled. I went ahead scheduled the surgery where I will be out under anesthesia.

My dentist informed me that he will be prescribing me pain killers to help with the pain and it‚Äôs making me really anxious. I really don‚Äôt want anything to do with them however I know I‚Äôm going to be hurting for a few days and have to work the day after.

IF, I were to have my wife pick up the prescription and be in charge of the recommended dosing, would that be considered a relapse? Would people view it that way? Why or why not? I have worked so hard to be where I‚Äôm at right now and I do not want to jeopardize what I have going.

I know at the end of the day, it‚Äôs really how I view it and it really doesn‚Äôt matter on what people think, but I‚Äôm still curious on your thoughts. I know I‚Äôm not the only one who already has or will have to deal with this situation. Thank you all for reading this and any input you have.",5

So to give context, I‚Äôm 22 and living at home with both parents and two younger brothers. I‚Äôm currently in between semesters at college and working part time in retail. I‚Äôm down to 3mg of methadone (from 50mg) and I would‚Äôve had 3 years of sobriety come February 24th if I hadn‚Äôt relapsed a few weeks ago. I used to use everything, but my main drugs of choice were heroin, meth, ketamine, and Xanax. So far I haven‚Äôt even started drinking yet, I‚Äôve only relapsed on ketamine. I remember speaking to my parents a few months back and asking them what they‚Äôd like me to do in the case of a relapse and they pretty much just wanted honesty from me. They said they‚Äôd want me to tell them whether or not I wanted to get clean again or keep using after a relapse. If I wanted to get clean again they‚Äôd support me and if I wanted to keep using they‚Äôd give me a couple days to get my things together and move out. I‚Äôve managed to make/save almost 30k in the last 3 years so they said that if I relapsed and didn‚Äôt wanna get clean that they would hold on to my money and give it to me in small increments to make sure that I don‚Äôt get myself killed buying a whole bunch of drugs at once. Anyways by reading this post I guess it‚Äôs obvious that I‚Äôve relapsed and have no intention of getting clean and sober again right now. I honestly just don‚Äôt have the strength to tell them that I‚Äôve not only relapsed, but don‚Äôt want to get clean again. Again please don‚Äôt try to talk me into getting clean again, it‚Äôs not gonna happen right now. I feel very ashamed and anxious about what I‚Äôve done, but unfortunately it just doesn‚Äôt seem to be enough to make me wanna get clean right now. All I need help with is how to break the bad news to them in an honest way while also not dragging it out too long. I don‚Äôt want some long and painful conversation about it, but I still want to remain truthful. Thanks in advance and I apologize if some of this didn‚Äôt make sense as I‚Äôm high atm.",3

Instead I became the addict. I‚Äôm not sure how it happened, how I let it become so frequent or why I knowingly let it escalate. When I found out he was shooting up again I made him show me how, out of spite, mostly. And I was so unimpressed by the experience. It was my third time shooting up that I finally experienced a level of relief only granted by IV methamphetamines. We carried on for maybe a month or so before both decided enough was enough. He wanted to get off subs so he went off to detox, hoping that once he kicks those that he can let go of the rest.

I told myself it was a better alternative to frequent alcohol use and consuming mass amounts of caffeine like I had been doing. I slowly began incorporating both of those back but I can honestly say that alcohol at least doesn‚Äôt really do it for me anymore. That being said, kratom gave me the first feelings of happiness and well-being in years. I eventually got to a point where I was taking 15 grams a day, give or take a little. I can‚Äôt do anything anymore without having it. I realized when I was scared to plan a vacation overseas because I wouldn‚Äôt have access to it that I had a problem.

2021-12-26 20:21:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rpb16v/beating_binge_eating_and_video_games/,Beating Binge Eating and Video Games!,"I go into some depth here about moderate addictions. This content is pretty light and should be a good read!

Addictions are like a toxic relationship. I‚Äôd suffered my whole life from video game addiction and food addiction. When I turned 13 years old, I was 106kg (234 lbs) and not super tall. Three years ago, a few months after turning 16, I decided I‚Äôd had enough of not being in control of my life. I went from playing video games 12 hours a day and eating any crap I wished to no video games, and I did the keto diet for two years (in retrospect I DO NOT recommend the keto diet for more than 6 months!!)

Breaking addictions are hard, and require a few things to do as your body‚Äôs release of dopamine normalises.
1: Extensive planning. Stop the cravings BEFORE they happen! What‚Äôs something you can do to beat or prevent a craving? I find that going to the gym for a full, hardy 1.5-2 hours normalises your dopamine. If I binge a bit then go to the gym, I feel very full afterwards. Exercise brings awareness back into my body. If I didn‚Äôt go to the gym, chances are I would have continued the binge. For you, an activity that can beat a craving could be a walk, a phone call to a friend, a swim, reading, music, whatever works for you! Your path is individual. 
2: A new perspective on your emotions. We are thoughtful beings with bleeding hearts, and our emotions should be paid attention to. However, there are times which we need to separate ourselves from our emotions. The bad ones, I mean. You‚Äôll know that the choice to binge eat, or take part in another addiction, is an emotional choice. This is a tough one, and it places you on way to become a master of your own mind.
3: Know that addictions prey on the weakened. Depression and anxiety have crept their way into my life at times. I find it‚Äôs times like these where my cravings surge, even if I‚Äôm six months clean. Even though you‚Äôll want to do anything to get rid of that anxious or blue feeling, try to maintain perspective during this time. I think of ‚Äúvideo games‚Äù and ‚Äúbinge eating‚Äù as evil ‚Äúvultures‚Äù, ready to scavenge on my life when I‚Äôm at my weakest and most vulnerable. This helps me get through the stressful period rather than succumb to negative behaviours. You will find that you‚Äôll need to engage in distractive behaviours of course, but try to engage in healthy hobbies as opposed to continually punishing yourself more than you need to. Once you learn of your hidden mental strength in a mind that isn‚Äôt governed by addiction, you‚Äôll find setbacks to be a lot less cumbersome, and see them as opportunities to grow.
4: Be open. Tell family and close friends about what you‚Äôre going through and what you‚Äôre going to do about it. You‚Äôll feel the weight of the addiction come off your shoulders! Be open with yourself if you relapse. Relapses are great for teaching us what causes us to relapse, strengthening us for the next time we try to quit.
5: Know that it‚Äôs not your fault. Our capitalist society has a way of encouraging things that are detrimental to our health, because addictions make money. (I‚Äôm talking about legal addictions here; social media, food, alcohol, video games - these things are generally encouraged by those around you. You could even call them culturally addictive!) Many companies are capitalising on our susceptibility to addiction. Doritos, McDonald‚Äôs, Wendy‚Äôs, anything that‚Äôs packed with refined sugar and extra fats and oils. You start thinking that you‚Äôre a horrible human being for eating like crap, then you convince yourself that you need to eat more of it. How does that work!?? I‚Äôll tell you. Addictions are like toxic relationships. They convince you that you need them in your life by secretly beating you down, thereby tarnishing your quality of life, a life which revolves around the addiction. Of course, addiction is one of the last things you‚Äôd want to blame. ‚ÄúRonald McDonald is such a friendly character. And Colonel Sanders is certainly no Pablo Escobar.‚Äù Wrong. They‚Äôve both got you hooked, and always leave you wanting more.

How happy would you be for your best friend if they finally split up with their awfully toxic partner after years of pain? They were blinded by their tainted love; love that was riddled with arguments, inconsistencies and clinginess, love that was sustained by the tick of approval from the family (little did they know what the relationship was like behind closed doors), the societal need to ‚Äúpartner up‚Äù, and the fear of living without love. The hardest thing about quitting video games and binge eating, for me, was picturing a life without them. That‚Äôs how they get ya.

Like a toxic partner, when you end it with your addiction, you‚Äôll find that you‚Äôll have cut yourself free in the process, maximising your capability for living and loving life.

Epilogue: I relapse every now and then, either when I‚Äôm feeling really good or really bad. It really helps knowing that it‚Äôs not my fault, as our capitalist society offers quick fixes that seem too good to be true to our primitive brains. Then it‚Äôs easy to get myself back on track, because I‚Äôve developed the strategies mentioned above to get over a relapse/splurge.
Sometimes when I‚Äôd feel awful, I‚Äôd play games and binge eat at the same time. And that is a deadly combination. You don‚Äôt even know how much food you‚Äôre eating. It‚Äôs scary.
Also quick shoutout to Cam Adair at GameQuitters!! He helped me turn my life around! Find them on YouTube or socials if you‚Äôre struggling with anything addiction related!
I now track my calories too. I find it‚Äôs fun and helps with satiety, as I know exactly how much I‚Äôve eaten. Through systematic weight loss by tracking calories, I‚Äôve achieved 17% body fat, losing 18 kilograms.
I‚Äôm also studying a degree of music performance currently, and feel as happy and healthy as ever!

My life used to be a vicious dopamine cycle. As a result, I was the quiet fat gamer kid.
Three years ago, when I took control over my addictions, I feel like my life truly began.

Stay tuned, I might post some more here!
If you liked this, let me know. If you really hated it, let me know! I‚Äôm a geek about this and would love to talk more about it!",6
2021-12-26 19:48:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rpads5/i_feel_free/,I feel free,"Yesterday on Christmas it felt like I dropped the last bit of my addict brain by opening up to my family about my addiction. I‚Äôve been ‚Äúclean‚Äù for several months now. I was an everyday binge drinker for about 1.5 years, and a drinker for awhile before that. I would frequently start before noon and generally drink at least a bottle of strong whisky by the time I passed out. I was deeply depressed and wanted to die most days of the week. I was ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù as in I managed to keep my job and generally hide the full extent of my addiction. After getting clean, however I still had the same mindset I had as an addict and was covering up my emotions and underlying issues by smoking marijuana all the god damn day. This definitely sounds worse than it is. I give a fair bit of credit to shrooms and marijuana for getting me off the bottle. (Please, please do not consider this advice. I lucked out on a mushroom trip and came out of it not wanting to drink. IMO Addicts should not use psychedelics/weed as a means to recovery, at least not until sufficient research has been done on these drugs AND they are available in a safe clinical setting. Additionally my brain and body react very well to marijuana, this is not the case for everyone) I was able to reclaim my health and get back to kickboxing. I was essentially back to doing things as I used to‚Ä¶ but I could not restore my ability to feel. I was still deeply unhappy.

I faced my addiction alone. And now I regret that I never reached out for help. I moved away from everyone I knew shortly before my addiction took off and felt as though I couldn‚Äôt let my family and friends see me in such a terrible state. The reality couldn‚Äôt have been more different. When I told my loved ones that I had been dealing with addiction I was met with nothing but love and positive affirmations. Immediately I felt the weight of addiction lifted from my shoulders. If I would have just talked to someone early on I may have avoided the darkest days I could ever imagine. 

My point of this post isn‚Äôt to tell you all about how great I feel but to share with any of my fellow addicts what I‚Äôve learned:
Recovery is about much more than getting off substances. It‚Äôs about reclaiming who you are and everything that you DESERVE. You deserve love, health, happiness, and prosperity. Substance abuse is deeper than just wanting to get fucked up, it‚Äôs about wanting a way out of whatever pain, at least for me. 

Addiction is a disease and any of you struggling right now I want you to know that you are not some junkie loser, you are a valuable person and you deserve your health and happiness. Talk to your family, or a friend, and if you don‚Äôt have loved ones you can trust in your corner then please get help from a professional as soon as possible.

Much love to you all :)",8

2021-12-26 16:46:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rp6lmu/groundhog_day/,Groundhog Day,"My day yesterday began the way almost everyday does. With a bang, the slamming of a closet door downstairs. The constant sounds of a human pinball game below, the loudest morning routine in the history of man. For a million different reasons, I don‚Äôt do particularly well with neighbors. I‚Äôm a light and restless sleeper. I grew up in a quiet and well insulated home. Drugs have done serious and likely irreparable damage to my brain and my fight or flight response. Nightmares, night terrors, sleep paralysis, anxiety attacks, and a creeping suspicion that I fit the criteria for PTSD. I‚Äôve had inconsiderate roommates, loud neighbors, drug fueled delusions of cameras and poison gas being fed through my vents, all night conversations with absolutely no one, praying for the mercy of sleep, waking up still in the nightmare, and months of sobriety where I struggled to distinguish between what was real and what wasn‚Äôt. 

The word schizophrenia has been uttered in my direction, but residual psychosis is more accurate. There‚Äôs getting high, and then there‚Äôs giving yourself a traumatic brain injury. There‚Äôs feeling suicidal, planning it, beginning to go through with it, and then the dawning realization that our sense of self-preservation is so strong that we will fight our way through any situation, real or imagined, because we absolutely have to. Then there‚Äôs the shit heroes are made of: moving on. And good God is that easier said than done. There‚Äôs always an invisible force trying to yank me back. Indescribable fear, rage and guilt brought on by the most mundane circumstances, so of course many of our veterans are addicted and homeless. My life can be hell sometimes, and the worst of my trauma wasn‚Äôt even real. It didn‚Äôt happen, yet my brain says it did. I shudder when I think about what they must go through.

I could have been wise yesterday. I could have calmly reasoned with him. I could have just bottled it up like I do every other day. But instead I put my shoes on and kicked the floor as loud as I possibly could. With all my might, I screamed ‚ÄúYO I‚ÄôM DONE WITH THIS SHIT! COME THE FUCK ON! SHUT A DOOR WITH SOME GRACE!‚Äù I ran a few miles and contemplated my first entry of fiction, a tale of me quietly knocking on his door. Him opening it. Me delivering a haymaker with a dominate left fist, turning off the lights on his stupid face with a single blow. Walking away smiling ear to ear. Sirens. Resisting arrest. Getting tased. Pissing and shitting myself. Spending Christmas Day in a cage. I calmed down and spent a wonderful day with my dad far away from fantasy land. Watched the Packers win on a blown call. Came home at 2 AM. Read my book. Thought about how far I‚Äôve come and how far I still have to go.

I awoke this morning with a bang, the slamming of a closet door downstairs.",19

It wasn't a sex addiction because it wasn't just about sex and some relationships weren't sexual. It was an addiction to the process of finding a new partner. 

Recently (past 6 months) I got into a relationship with someone who was completely fine with me sleeping with anyone, whenever, and having as many other relationships as I want. Everything about her is what I was seeking in the multitude of other relationships. 

I find myself returning to my old pattern of looking, but instead of flirting or replying to a post or asking someone out I get this sinking feeling like it's pointless and don't want to. Almost like getting bored with doing meth (I know I know). She still insists there's no issue with it, but for once I find myself completely satisfied with my circumstances yet still addicted to the process of searching. 

Not sure how to transfer this focus to other things because it's something I've done for so long I feel lost not doing it.

TL;DR
Addicted to starting relationships and feel lost now that I have no need to do so. Not sure how to solve that feeling.",1

2021-12-26 12:00:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rp0vvs/my_struggles_with_benzos_ambien_other_pills_and/,"My struggles with benzos, Ambien, other pills and chronic pain","I started seeing my psychiatrist about 3 years ago since I wasn't sleeping for weeks and my chronic pain issues now started to develop. It reached to the point where I was hallucinating, life was a blur and I was in constant pain. (chronic headaches but no doctor or specialist could identify them all; nummular headaches, tension, and other types of body pain stemming from it).

I was 18 when I began taking high doses of Ambien CR, benzos and was prescribed other pain preventatives, pain killers, antidepressants, mood stabilizers. In 2019 I took approx 600 pills and 2020 atleast 500 pills.

Everything felt so dull and I didn't care about life in general so I dropped out of school because of the pain, lost all my friends due to rumors of me overdosing on cocaine when it was an overdose on prescribed pills and I was also dosed with MDMA laced 'by accident' the day before my overdose but that's another story.

All my relationships started to get fucked up because what I would say and do on Ambien. I messed around with my best friend's girlfriend at the time and caused them to break up, lost my other friends because I would socially isolate myself because I didn't want to explain to everyone what I was going through. I was just tired of always trying to explain shit and people just not understanding the level of pain or what I had to do because of it.

My doctors finally found a regimen that somewhat worked but I was so drugged out of my mind I didn't care about anything. I started to like my pain and when the drugs took it away my mood use to switch all the time because I had to adjust my lifestyle so much aorund it I just didn't know what to do. 

After being lonely and depressed for a while I decided I couldn't go back to school since at this point I couldn't remember time periods in my life or my childhood until I was about 12. I started to use psychedelics every few months and that helped me remember alot of trauma from my childhood and forced me to relive these events until I came to terms with it. 

I opened a business in the Cannabis industry to help educate people about it's benifts and the misconceptions behind the herb and that was going great until my body started to reject all the pills I was taking on a daily basis.

Everyday for about a month I felt sick everytime I took a pill no matter what it was and I stopped eating because of it. I decided to cold turkey all the pills because I couldn't take it anymore and for 5 weeks after stopping, I couldn't move from my bed from how much pain I was in, so many suicidal thoughts, so many of my demons trying to pull me back into that mess I was in. I also started to only get about 3 hrs sleep for a week+ and was in a constant state of dissociation so I decided to get another prescription for Ambien.

After 2 weeks again I thought I could trip on some mushrooms since I didn't for a few months and thought it would push me forward on my journey to becoming sober but after the peak I got multiple panic attacks that kept reoccurring for hours, I didn't have anyone to call or talk to and I was just suffering in my head alone, struggling to breathe on my ground. 

Eventually I called my ex and she convinced me to take a xanax to calm down and I ended up taking 2g (4 0.5mg xanax) and I was able to sleep for 2 hrs after. 

Since I got the new Ambien prescription I've been drinking and taking a few Ambien almost every night and been getting sharp chest pain and more breathing issues because of it but I just want to numb myself out even if I keep bringing myself to the brink of death. 

I have a few hundred benzos from my past prescriptions but I limit myself only to xanax but the withdrawals feels like the worst thing I've ever experienced and makes me wish for death instead of going through this. I can't get my mind off of Xanax, I always use to look forward to coming home and unwinding by taking benzos, Ambien and smoking some bud.

Normally I could come off of pills by just forcing myself because in my mind it's just something that has to happen so might as well do it as soon as possible but this time I don't have anyone as a support group and I've just been suffering in silence. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest. This is my first post and I really appreciate everyone reading this.",1

My family are all crazy so I'm estranged from them and me and my partner of 5 years had broken up back in october. I feel bad about the holidays now and it gets quite depressing. He's a pothead and doesn't really understand how things have gotten for me, he sees addicts as exclusivly heroin addicts who steal to fund their habbit as his cousin does.

He had just dropped the news that his fiance was pregnant so it was celebration in the air too. We got high which I regretted so I got more high after food until I was blasted and Then I got an even more depressing feeling so I went home and drank a bottle of wine and passed out asleep.
I feel awful today, and I can't take it back.
How do we move forward from this place?

Insurances won't even cover detox for it in almost all cases. I've come to realize that I'm addicted to weed. Its been 10 years of daily smoking and I'm trying to stop. I moved to Iowa from California and I thought I could just stop. I ended up in the ER due to extreme nausea and vomiting. It was so bad that I passed out multiple times. It sucks being a fainter and I'm slowly going crazy over here. This is day 2 of absolutely no weed and I'm wondering if anyone has advice to help with the nausea. I was prescribed zofran to help ease the nausea but it only last for an hour or so. I took a hot bath and that seemed to calm the storm in my stomach as well. I know I'll get through it but man is this brutal.


Edit: Thanks for all the advice and honest words. I understand that weed withdrawals, if any, are not comparable to other harder drugs. I have worked in the field and I get it. There are other factors at play here such as gerd and gastritis. I also faint when I vomit outside of this current situation so that didn't help.

I actually started doing excercise and healthy dieting few months ago and so I don‚Äôt have the crippling binge watch habits where I watched YouTube for hours straight without even drinking water, but I do have random days where I spend my entire evening scrolling through YouTube and don‚Äôt feel good about it as I am sacrificing my study time doing it. I want to invest my time into something more productive and also to my studies for university exams. I‚Äôm not that bad in studies but I can definitely do much better if provided I‚Äôm not wasting my time on YouTube. There are patterns that I definitely notice but don‚Äôt seem to overcome so please tell me what to about them : 

1. Once I take a peak at YouTube after waking up or anytime in morning, there are high chances that I will be spending or rather wasting my day into scrolling endlessly through YouTube.

2. Only one study video is never enough.

3. If I find enough motivation to save YouTube it is always entangled with feeling of this stickiness or fatigue in vague terms that stays with me and I can‚Äôt focus on study as all I ever think about after that is video I saw or what xyz YouTuber is doing etc.

4. Most of the time when I AM able to leave YouTube by any means, it‚Äôs mostly to stumble upon a WhatsApp message or to Reddit where I scroll aimlessly without any purpose and ironically, not that interested as well, basically I‚Äôm scrolling for the sake of scrolling. It feels like my brain is just substituting one scrolling with another and I don‚Äôt like that.

I will say one more time that I am at very good position than earlier but now that I have assumed more healthier approach physically, and this occasional bursts are not what I want. I want complete freedom from the shackles of my past addictive self and I want to replace YouTube from my primary site of ‚ÄúGETTING RELAXED AND THEN DROWNING INTO THE OCEAN OF BINGING‚Äù to something more productive like reading books. Also I now read a lot more books compared to just few months ago but what I am saying is that in my leisure time, I don‚Äôt want to provide my energy to YouTube but rather to books or any other productive stuff.

Recently I had a major (or multiple major) falling out with someone (let's call him H) who I for the past 4/5 years have viewed as one of my best friends. He did have a bit of a saviour complex and that eventually became an issue, because originally he had gotten my ass into recovery and into an outpatient program. Like the dude had known me for all of 6 months and basically made himself available to me 12/7 and even 24/7 sometimes to ensure I stayed clean and sober. 

Anyway, I pottered along, getting a few months up here, lapsing, getting more months up there, lapsing, trying again, lapsing. It seemed like the most I could really get together was 10 months or so because I would perpetually slip up after that. He was always encouraging. 'Pick yourself back up and try again, it's not your fault, just learn from it for next time and try again now.' 

Eventually (2-3 years into the friendship) I was doing some research into cPTSD and I found something called the [Karpman Drama Triangle](https://lindagraham-mft.net/triangle-victim-rescuer-persecutor-get/) and boy oh boy did I realise I was stuck in one. And man, I wanted out. This also happened to be about the same time my friend started dating his current partner, someone whose ex was a hardcore binge IV methamphetamine user who inflicted a lot of pain and suffering on his partner due to his drug use. Understandably, my friend found him repulsive. But part of the reason for that, turned out to be because of his drug use which he had previously tolerated with me (going to the extent of buying a book called 'Addicted' which discusses the links between early childhood adversity and addiction very clearly. 

Now, this friend knew my trauma history (CSA from a parent continuing into adulthood, narciccistic and emotional abuse from that same parent). So generally, he was pretty tolerant of my use given for me a great deal of the time when it came down to those lapses often it was after a highly triggering event and I made a rash snap judgement between doing drugs or harming myself in a more tangible, physical way. And sometimes with how trapped I felt in my situation I felt like sometimes my choice was killing myself, or using drugs. So in that respect, drugs have kept me alive for long enough to start really working on some things now but I need to resettle into sobriety. 

In getting out of this triangle I tried to take some of my agency back, assert myself more, and tried to direct H to take on more of a 'coach' role rather than a rescuer. I had... Mixed results. Some days he seemed perfectly happy to act as a coach instead of a rescuer, but other days it was like 'no, I must deliver my 1-2 hour long lecture about all your life choices and situation and make sure you feel perpetually victimised to the extent it begins to hold back your mental health recovery and your future development is stifled.' Honestly there was a period of only 2-3 months where I felt like our friendship was actually reciprocal, and that was when we went to the gym together. Nothing but lifting weights, talking about lifting weights, going to get a burrito on the way home and then him and I discussing mainly our work weeks. But alas, this was not to be. We went to the gym roughly between November 2020 - Feb 2021 and I distinctly remember talking to him one day about how easy coming off Suboxone had been for me (though retrospectively, I definitely should have stayed on it as I intermittently relapsed throughout the first have of the year and ended up on Buvidal injections anyway) but like, I mentioned something like 'you'd still help me if I messed up still right' and he was like 'of course mate' because I already knew I wasn't going to make it off Suboxone. A couple of days later I texted him to let him know that I slipped up and he was like 'sorry man, [partner] and I are in the middle of moving houses, I won't have much time to help or support you while we do that but I'm sure you can use your skills you've built over the last few years to your advantage.' The thing was, I basically had no skills because this guy had cultivated a manufactured dependency upon him by me. He was the first person I always went to for help because of the initial 'no barriers' nature of our friendship and that he would let me sleep on his couch for a week at a time if it meant that it kept me off drugs. But he never encouraged me to build a wider support network than I really already had - him and a social worker, and maybe one other friend I could stay with if I really needed to. That was it, so he was all shocked that I'd slipped up (and potentially thought I had pre-planned it based on the previous text I'd sent) so he basically stopped talking to me for almost 8 months. Went from texting back within hours to a day to taking a week to respond, if he responded at all. 

What eventually ended up happening with this friend is that in order for him to hate his partners ex because of his addiction (and not because he was fundamentally just a really shitty person, which he apparently was), he had to take a zero tolerance approach to my slip ups. Apparently, my once a year for one night use was now equivalent to a guy who binged for two weeks every couple of months while neglecting his family. I remember on Christmas 2019 I overdosed on a crazy strong batch. The only reason I didn't die was sheer, dumb, luck. I normally buy a certain amount, and I bought half that. Then I used half of what I'd normally use because I wanted some for the next day. I spent 9 hours under a cold shower hallucinating and paranoid that I was going to die. I was drenched in sweat and I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. It was hellish - my first true Overamp. Yet not two months later, H is on the phone with me, telling me about how badly he wants his partners ex to OD even after he knew how close I came to dying. I pointed that out, and he *kinda* apologised but would still say it all the time. And suddenly their neighbourhood druggies were 'IV meth-heads' as if how they took the drug was somehow relevant to how irritating they would be. I don't know about anyone else but I've found people who smoke or snort to be just as annoying. And H's intolerance to my drug use extended past my meth use - when I sent him a message explaining that I'd slipped up on heroin for the first time in 3 years he didn't even respond. It was such a weird feeling going from having someone have my back, to not having any response at all. When I brought it up on the phone a month or two months after the fact he was pretty terse about it. And anytime I wanted a discussion about my recovery he would change the topic pretty fast. So it became pretty clear it was a no go zone. It just meant that by December 2020 he was like 'we'd be coming up on your 1 year off meth soon wouldn't we?' and I was like 'ahh, not so much. It's been 9 months. I used in March, I just didn't want to tell you about it because you made it clear where you stood on the issue - and I'm back up to 9 months anyway at this stage so your input wasn't necessary.' Let's just say he wasn't... Thrilled by this development. Had a go at me because the entire premise of our friendship was about my honesty when I used drugs. I pointed out I had been honest - he just hadn't asked in 9 months what my day counter was at, which he had done in the past. I told him it didn't matter and I was handling it myself. After that discussion, my drug use probably only ever came up one more time which was the day I went out to lunch to celebrate one year off meth. He attended late and left early as well, despite the date being in his calender for months. But at the end of the day he is his own person. It was just extremely odd having him go from someone I knew wouldn't judge me for my choice of drugs and method of use, and seemingly understood why I was doing it too. Alas, that turned into judgement, judgement, and 'because I obviously just wanted to.'

Now to the point of the post, congratulations if you've managed to read this far. 


If you want the store of the falling out, it's in my post history under the AITA post about being in the hospital. Other fucked up stuff this 'friend' did would be to joke in front of me and friends about inappropriately touching me, and on one or two occasions actually did so (prompting him to almost get punched by myself as an automatic reaction) while knowing that one of my specific trauma triggers is being touched exactly where he touched me by anyone, but especially men. Me being me, I just let it slide. 

When I fell out with him I turned back to meth pretty fast. I'd just come out of a psych unit for a stretch and I'd had some awful cravings the previous week's leading up to it that came out of nowhere. I'd say in the last 3 weeks I've probably used like, 8/9 of those days? So it's well and truly past a slip. 

The pros: 

I'm on the NDIS in Australia (National Disability Insurance Scheme) for Autism and Mental Health disability. My next plan (with the government funding) is going to contain money for a 'positive behaviour support plan' whereby all of my 'behaviours of concern' (think self-harm, IVDU, social withdrawal, suicide attempts, manic or depressive episodes) will all be fastidiously noted down, and monitored going forward with strategies being implemented that reduce or eliminate some if not all of the behaviour. Restrictive practices may be used (and in the case of a drug relapse, a restrictive practice which may be approved would be not giving me free access to my own money - a trusted support worker or friend is given access instead. No money, no drugs. Also, my support workers will all be trained in trauma informed care. This is super important to me. I just had to fire a SW because I hired him for his lived (7 years sober) experience and lived trauma experience. When he got to my place he was happy enough to be there but when I told him I relapsed he got standoffish real quick, then eventually accused me of still being high (it was Friday, I used on Sunday/Monday and had slept 2 full night's the prior two nights so not even strung out. Told me I was acting aggressively because I couldn't get my contact lens out (which may I point out, is agitating for absolutely anyone and immensely painful). Him leaving dysregulated me really badly and I genuinely had thoughts of self harm and drug use as a result. He also left me without breakfast or lunch food for 5 days unless another SW could step in, which thankfully one did. That was *not* trauma informed care - his job is to reduce the behaviour of concern, not increase the chances of another one happening. If he was too uncomfortable to be around anyone who used drugs within the previous week he shouldn't have marketed himself as a peer worker. That is the main reason I hired him. 

While I technically finished my social worker programme I can /technically/ ask Brendan for a bump up session once monthly/bimonthly or something and just explain its gotten a bit more out of hand than I initially expected and it's clear to me that I need some external motivation while I try to think of what is rewarding enough to me to act as an internal motivation. He has a lot of insight into how shame is tied into drug use as well so I find his sessions very useful. It would probably be smart to message him next week once everyone is back to work. 

I do work and have a job I enjoy, so I can't go completely nuts. I need to be able to drive to and from work. 

The cons: 

My addiction is tied to shame which is tied to my trauma and as long as I still blame myself for the abuse (which to an extent I do) I will continue to punish myself by self-harming, or using drugs. This is the real big one. I don't know how to find that compassion for myself. 

While I work on that, does anyone have any other ideas of internal motivation I can use instead of someone who unfortunately turned out to be a shit friend (the reasons for which can be seen in my post history in the AITA story about being in the hospital).

The last normal function I went to before I got hooked bad on ice was a Christmas event with some normie friends.  The next two Christmas' I found my place in some extremely dark places.  Mostly jumping around from hotel to hotel with a group of other fucked off addicts.  One inparticular was spent making DMT with a beautiful person that ended up getting blown away in a triple homicide while I was locked up.  I hope you are resting in peace Jess.  The Christmas after that one I was locked up at 1200 Baker in downtown Houston county jail.  The only way we knew it was Christmas there was because the commercials on the tiny TV were holiday themed.  There was no special Christmas meal and no Christmas decorations.  The next couple of Christmases after that are still dark because they are a constant reminder of how bad one can fuck up.

The two Christmases I spent in early recovery I had little to no money and was living with my parents.  My family didn't want to give me anything too nice because they weren't back to trusting me yet.  Everyone is supposed to be happy and family get togethers are to be cheery and bright.  But damn after a string of dark and shitty Christmases, my Christmas this year is actually better.  I have been living back on my own this year for the first time and have found work that I truly enjoy.  I know life isn't always going to be easy and I know that you never ""beat"" addiction as one must always keep a healthy fear of relapse, but this Christmas is the first good one I have had in a really long time.

I know someone is reading this and lonely right now.  Wondering what the fuck they are doing on r/addiction on Christmas morning.  Wondering how bad they are losing themselves and fearful of where the path they are on will end.  Well I just wanted to share this and tell you that after you hit your rock bottom, recovery is indeed possible.  If I can come back from being homeless and breaking my leg running from police, you can too.  I wish I knew a combination of words one could read to help solve or play a tremendous role in helping someone out of the darkness that encompasses addiction, but I can‚Äôt think of anything so just be careful out there.  I guess everyone must find their own path in that regard.

Addiction is no fun for anyone involved. I mean the getting high part can be, but there will ALWAYS be a come down and return to reality and sobriety unless you die in the cause; of which several people that I used to run with came to that end.  I don't really know what I am saying....just wanted to let all of you know that you don't have to fight this battle alone and by yourself.  I encourage you to take one step further from reading this subreddit and seek real life help with anyone you trust.  A friend, family member, counselor, AA, NA meeting....shit... anyone that you think can help.  Feel free to reach out to me too.

Merry Christmas yall.  I hope nothing but the best for every person that happens to read this post.

2021-12-25 07:43:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ro962y/which_addiction_is_worse_cigarettes_or_porn/,Which addiction is worse: Cigarettes or Porn?,"A few years ago I had a discussion with my ex girlfriend about my porn addiction. She wasn't taking the addiction that serious, and she said that stuff like cigarettes gives you ""real addiction"".

What is your opinion on that? 
I'm not talking about which addiction has worse consequences, but only about which addiction is harder to overcome, which drug is harder to quit.

I cannot talk for smoking because I never smoked a single cigarette in my entire life. But I can talk about porn. 

I'm now 21 years old and I started watching porn when I was 11. When I was 14 I watched several pornos per day, as I was fapping once per day. So porn was 100% normal for me way before I even got a kiss on my cheek from a girl. I lost my virginity with 16. 
I then noticed that I have an erectile dysfunction, that I needed to think about porn while sex to be able to cum. And such stuff. Then I tried quitting porn. Now it's been 4 years I'm already trying to quit it and I still didn't do it (I'm on a very good path now, but not done).

I believe that cigarettes are very addictive too, but there are just some things that make porn so bad, that cigarettes don't have:

- sex is the most natural thing, especially for men. And there's nothing bad about sex, it's like necessary
- cigarettes are not normal at all, it's literally inhaling the worst stuff in your body made in a fabric

- men in the age of 20-30 think about sex maybe 100 times per day, and that is completely normal, also if you've never watched a single porn if your entire life

- porn is for free. Cigarettes are expensive as hell 

- porn is accessable everywhere, anytime. All I need is my smartphone, which I always have with me. To get a great clip it literally takes only like 10 taps on the phone, so like 7 seconds

- I'm single now, I study mathematics and I work on top of that. I go out only once in two weeks. That's the only time where I can try to get ""real sex"". And that surely doesn't always work. So I get real sex like once per month or once in 2 months. While I think about sex 100 times per day!! The easiest solution would be to watch porn (or go to brothel, but that isn't an option either).

- porn also is industrialized and gives you the best girls with the best settings, etc. Etc. Real sex cannot ever give you this perfection.

- smoking is not seen well in society. If you smoke, you also smell. And nobody likes it, especially if you're searching for a girl, they don't like that. 
- porn is absolutely normal. Everyone does it, literally everyone. And nobody cares. I barely heard ever someone male denying they watch porn.

All that stuff is so bad and is what makes porn so addictive. But none of that applies to cigarettes. 

So do you really think cigarettes is harder to quit than porn?",3

2021-12-25 03:26:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ro5tr8/i_dont_have_a_drug_problem/,I Don't Have A Drug Problem,"I got in too deep this time. A month ago I thought I was an addict, I read some of the literature and tried to do my research. I even actively attempt to reflect on it in my daily life over the course of a year. I actively seek to improve myself, and have either softened/eliminated glaring character flaws.

Yet here I am. Pretty much sobered up after a binge. It was pathetic, I mostly took care of myself. But why, why do this again? I took the time to journal this one. This isn't worthwhile at all, it devolves into degeneracy in tiny little increments. 

 I understood every little action I could've taken to stop this and I just didn't. There wasn't even a big stressor, just a persistent delusion that I am unique. When I'm not high, I zone out; I never give myself a single second to self-reflect. But this comedown completely takes away all of my coping mechanisms. Everytime sitting here in this, I come to the same realization: I don't have a problem with drugs. I'm the problem. 

If I get clean again? How could that ever be worth it? I'll spend years of my life trying to get better still being miserable. If I don't believe in an afterlife, this is all I've got. I'm miserable doing drugs and die early or I'm miserable clean. The chances I have an impact on the world in a substantial way are abysmal. I could stop, I could keep going. Same misery, different pains. So long as my mom is alive, suicide is off the table. 

I take in the experiences from much more experienced users than myself and I know exactly where I'm headed. This is not a unique story, I am not special in any way. Tomorrow I'm going to regain the illusion of control and start the cycle again. Oblivious, trying to forget  that I am not really a person anymore and I never will be.",3

So over Easter earlier this year I was having dinner with my brother, my mom and my moms boyfriend. I have bad anxiety and this night my anxiety was flaring up because I was very uncomfortable having dinner with my moms boyfriend. To take the edge off I took half a Xanax bar (1mg) and had some wine during the meal. Towards the end of the night when my brother left and it was just my mom, her boyfriend and I, I asked to be excused to go take a bath. I filled up the water in the bath and locked the door behind me. At this time I took another 1mg Xanax and snorted half a 30mg oxycodone. This is not a combo I am entirely unfamiliar with, therefore I knew my limits and tolerance and knew that this was a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù dose for me. Little did I know my dealer, instead of giving me a prescription oxy, had given me a pressed M30 fentanyl pill. All I remember after snorting the fentanyl was laying down in the bath and relaxing. Next thing I know I wake up to my mom hysterically crying, in a state of despair and panic smashing her hands against the outside of the door. I get up, open the door and embrace my mom. Just a few minutes later my brother comes in (my mom had called him when she couldn‚Äôt get the door open). I realized what had happened and told my family I didn‚Äôt hear the knocking because I had my Bose headphones on with the noise canceling‚Ä¶ yes fuckkng stupid excuse. 

Anyways, when I woke up, I really didn‚Äôt feel that fucked up. I don‚Äôt know how long I was out for. Obviously I did overdose because I took fentanyl with Xanax and took a dose that was too high for me to handle. I don‚Äôt even know what question I‚Äôm asking lol but do you think overdosed to the point of having needed a shot of Narcan? Or did I just nod out hard enough to not be aware of and hear my surroundings?

Yes this was a fucked up, scary situation and I feel incredibly ashamed and guilty for putting my mom through that. I don‚Äôt need the whole ‚Äúyou should stop using and go to rehab‚Äù. Since then I‚Äôve cut my drug use almost entirely (still use kratom) and opened up with friends and family about my mental struggle with anxiety, depression and substance abuse.",2

Everyone must find their butter,

A vice that squeezes the heart,

But makes burnt life tolerable bliss,

Heroin elegantly pollinated my soul,

Like a shield of warmth for the cold,

Nodding off instead of trying,

Why try when I always to die?

Kicked the habit out of orbit,

Tried various highs that made me mad,

I danced my life with bad intentions,

Until I danced into a psych ward,

And my hedonistic party had to stop,

Trying to rationalize another suicide,

My butter had to get stronger on the heart,

Voices flooded my mind, and I cried,

Scared and out of mind, 

How I will progress as my mind quakes,

Not until I tried prescribed butter,

The voices stopped as lithium reign,

Feeling a bit closer to whole.",3

Covid is hard with an infant and a partner who has a family that is very religious and conservative. Baby has so much love and so many great people in her life yet it is difficult to focus on that when seeing the lack of consideration of sickness and concern for others. I have a strong addictive personality and passion for life and the complexities that have been written, sung, and viewed by all humans. Having a partner that dislikes or doesn't see the social justice issues in the world and the neighbors suffering hurts. I react with chemicals while having a dream life with so many things a kid dreams of. I see pain and struggle around the world with personal experience and want to have an outlet to discuss that and how that pain weighs on a person while seeing a society that ignores it or even pretends it isn't there. This society is hurtful and not allowing the people to have compassion or truth to help those who have the least. Urgh. Love is difficult yet helping others and being compassionate and giving is my greatest joy. To block that to honor a partner who sees jealousy as the main factor has pained me greatly. I desire to have a journey in Brazil with ayahuasca to clear the anger and feel like I justify cleansing for it. Growth is happening yet I would like to give up pleasing others to be healthier.

A pound of coke is valued closer to 15-18k.  54k for 18lbs of meth is like the price I used to pay for weed from Canada back when the B.C. bud craze was in gear.  I was getting killer bud for close to $2.5k-3k a pound.   That's like $7 a gram!!!  That means I could sell it for 3.5gs for $40 and still almost double my money.  That's fucking nuts.  Meth should not be that cheap.,3

Just some background, I'm 22, my brother is 21, since I've been \~9 years old my parents have been addicted to drugs, various drugs. As of writing this I'm aware that they're using Heroine and Meth. As you can imagine, it's been the source of a lot of trauma in my life, but I've forgiven my parents and love them dearly. They've expressed interest in getting clean, but they seem to want to do it on their own, without going to a rehab center. I know that ultimately if I can convince them to seek help, they're going to have to really want it before they do anything, but for now I'm just seeking advice for finding options for them.

The situation seems really messy and I'm not sure what options are available to them. The house they've been renting for a long time since I was like 12 is in complete shambles, my dad hasn't had a job outside of drug dealing for a long time, and he said he's stopped dealing, but has resorted to selling things out of his garage online for money. That's what he says at least. I don't believe they have any health insurance. So with all of this I'm not sure how they would be able to afford rehab. Even if they could, what would happen to their house with all their possessions in it? What would happen to their dogs? My dad is in his 40s, what would he do afterwards.

It often feels like a really hopeless situation, but I'm hoping that someone may be able to inform me of programs that may be able to help them. We do live in California, I'm not sure of the policies or programs available to recovering addicts here, but that may be pretty relevant information.

Given all of this, what options are there for my parents? Where should I look to learn about this stuff? What steps do they need to take? For example, do I need to get them on medi-cal or something? I'd really really appreciate any advice here, or at least just pointing me in the right direction. Thanks so much. If you're a believer, please pray for my parents.",3

I hear alot about Reddit communities so thought I'd try hear as I'm struggling to find what I'm looking for online. 
I live in the UK and can't seem to find any general Addiction support groups. 

I don't feel like I've completely fallen off the wagon yet but the train is definitely derailing. 
I'm 28, I've been binge drinking since I was 13, started smoking at 10. At the age of 19 I started smoking weed everyday until I was 26.... (my brother is addicted to ketimine to the point he's ruining his life and is booked in for his second trip to rehab) and we made a pack to get sober together.... I managed to stop smoking weed (my relationship with my fiance had broken down a couple of months before) I'm now 19 months weed free.... with the odd dabble

I started to smoke very very socially once I started a new job in the city and had access again. I pride myself on not buying it for the past 19 months. But deep down I know I've failed myself...
My most recent ex found a joint in out house and blamed me for bringing it in..... to this day I have no idea how it got there but I smoked it once she was asleep anyway... I honestly don't even know why I do it to myself. 

We moved into a house together and 2 months in we ended the relationship. I felt like I could just never be what she wanted. Long story short we are stuck living together for the next two months (2 months being separated)
The past 2 months I think I've drank alcohol almost every day. I'm not getting trashed and wasted but I can feel its abnormal. I'm still holding down a job but I've been late alot recently and when I do see my ex around the house she looks at me with such disgust and disappointment and I just can't bare it. We don't speak so she has no idea what's going on with me.


I'm looking for a group or if anyone could point me in the right direction of a group that covers addictions as a whole rather than home in on one substance. I just need to talk to people who get it. 

I've tried therapy before and am on the waiting list to try it again. 
I'm the new year my pay rise will take affect and I'll be able to afford private therapy but I just hate feeling alone with it all. 
I tried to be as open with my ex as i could because her ex spouse struggled with alcoholism but I don't think she ever understood the fight first hand. And now I've ended up here...

Addiction runs in both sides of my family so I'm high risk... if not already under the thumb

I have a pretty bad addiction to coke, I'm a European living in South America and so it is very easy to get and very cheap. My main issue is that i am lying to my wife, my friends and avoiding meeting people if possible. I have gotten to a point where i take coke from sun up to sun down basically all week and congratulate myself if i spend more than two days without getting high. I took an ounce in 4 days last weekend and 8 grams a day midweek is not out of the ordinary.  The biggest problem is that no one Seems to notice, i don't care about the health effects if I'm being honest it's more not wanting to hurt my wife,las i never wanting to do anything, go to dinners/ parties, talk to my family on Skype and always want to be alone. I have always been an introvert but it's getting to the point i think my wife and family think I don't like them. I am willing to try whatever advice people can give on how to stop without them finding out as no one in my life, personal or professional seems to have noticed i have a problem. I know people are thinking of course they know but they genuinely don't, it might be easier to stop if they did but if i did a line in front of them they would probably still think it's a joke or something, realistically i am also dealing with a parallel alcohol dependence but that's a different issue which everyone is aware of.

Basically i need advice on how to get off an addictive drug when no one knows i take it and without being a complete arsehole from the withdrawal. Very possibly an unrealistic longshot but advice is appreciated",6

(NSFW),"(Note: I don't actually know what's considered NSFW. If this doesn't qualify lmk. I'm not exactly a veteran reddit user. This has no pictures, but does describe a few graphic things in somewhat graphic details involving drug use and the desperate acts of the addicted. I added the label just to be safe. If you are recovering, and warstories are the kinds of things that may trigger you, maybe skip this post.)


I've seen some wild shit in my time. I've seen plungers held together by super glue, or kind of melted together after they broke. I've seen someone use a cat's whisker they found in their carpet to unclog a needle. I've seen people use lighters to heat up needles to get the air bubbles out, or using finger nail filed or their hair follicles to try and sharpen the point. 

I would hope this would go without saying, but I'll say it anyway... These things can all pose serious risks to your health. Obviously drugs in general do. Especially when administered via injection. If you're going to use, obviously I can not stop you. Please, please don't do anything I'm listing here. Doing things like trying to use a syringe once it's been clogged (even if you manage to get the clog out) can cause coagulated blood to go to your heart or lungs and cause damage, stroke, even death.. thats just one risk. There are many more.

Please be safe and be smart. The hassle of finding a new rig is better than death. 

This post isn't to give anyone any new ideas. It's to act as a warning, and kind of a look back at some of the more desperate things that happen, since drug use is often glorified by some people. 

I am a clean and sober person now, but I've been in the trenches, let's just say. I've been down in the mud and shit and blood and guts. 


On the more hilarious side of things: 


I also had a friend who knew he was going to jail for a while. He bought as many methadone as his plug could supply and put a bunch of them inside a cellophane from a cigarette pack and sort of twisted and melted it closed. He shoved it up the one place he might be able to hide it during a strip search. He did this the night before to kind of test how to do it in privacy. Well, it went up there just fine, but he left it up there for a bit too see if it would slip in further or fall out if he moved around. Apparently his body heat warped the cellophane and when he went to take it out (he'd left like a mouse tail when he melted it, to act as a pull string) the loose end of it began to stretch like a rubber band. Idk how this is possible. Never seen cellophane do this, but according to him, he kept pulling, it kept stretching, and eventually he lost his grip. Just like a rubber band, it snapped back and popped him right on the brown eye. He screamed like a dying animal. 

I could go on all day (clearly). My stories are a lot wilder than some people's, but I also know they are SUPER tame compared to some others.

End conclusion: stay sober, & treat mental illness with therapy instead.","Trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è self harm, sexual assault, death, dr*gs, mental illness, etc. don‚Äôt read this if you‚Äôre actively struggling with any of the above. Take care of yourself. 

I made a throw away because I‚Äôm about to go into some pretty graphic details here that I don‚Äôt want linked to my main profile, but the throwaway didn‚Äôt work because I had zero karma, so I‚Äôm on an old acc, hopefully everything is wiped from it lol. I‚Äôm 19, I suffer from BPD, insomnia, PTSD, and; Endometriosis. Endometriosis for those of you that don‚Äôt know is a chronic condition that causes internal bleeding, lots of pain, not a fun time; I was diagnosed this year. 

For the sake brevity, I‚Äôm gonna be extremely blunt, and straight to the point here, if it sounds like I‚Äôm being insensitive, pardon me, I‚Äôm just trying to make this short as possible, and after going through all of this I guess I am a bit desensitized. I had a really rough child hood, my parents were both addicts, I was raised by my grandparents, my grandfather ended up hanging himself in the shed in our backyard when I was 4, so then on it was just my grandma, my uncle, and my father who was extremely in and out of my life, and caused me more trauma than he did good (example: when I was thirteen has almost killed me by giving me two OxyContin forty mgs, regularly beat his gfs in front of me, etc) I finally met my mom when I was 13, we had a rocky relationship, she stayed sober for 5 years, then went off the deep end again. Last I checked she was on the streets in her old home town being looked for by police on account of her dealer bf being a murder suspect. 

I love my grandma, and I appreciate everything she‚Äôs done for me, but living with her was toxic. I believe she‚Äôs bipolar like my father. At 11 she allowed her brother to move in with us, and he began molesting me until I was halfway through my first year of high school. I started cutting myself around 11 as well. I tried to tell my family what he was doing, I didn‚Äôt for a long time because he was grooming me with cigarettes and alcohol, and I was scared of getting in trouble for smoking and drinking at eleven; I told them when I was turning thirteen; my grandma believed me but my uncle didn‚Äôt they let him continue living in the house, things died down for about a week and then start up again until he moved out when I was fourteen. 

After that I needed up in a series of horrible relationships, one when I was 16, the guy was 21 and a dealer, ended up giving me a fuck ton of Xanax, took advantage of me while I was fucked up, filmed it, and posted it on instagram and Snapchat for my entire school to see, that was great. I spent majority of my teenage years trying to stop my heroin addict father from killing himself, and; jumping from shitty dude to shitty dude, there‚Äôs a lot in between that but for time sake I‚Äôm cutting this down as much as possible.

Fastforward I turn 17 and meet the love of my life, we‚Äôll call him Cam. Cam and I hooked up the first night we met, and spent every weekend together afterwards until we started dating. A year into our relationship Covid happens, and we decide to move in together in the city. A year into us living together he ended up basically cheating on me for two weeks behind my back while we were on a break and still living together, I ended up attempting suicide, third visit to the psych ward, a guy that worked with K‚Äôs company (I‚Äôll get into that in a second) who would later assault me, ends up taking me to get meds, and making sure I was okay while Cam continued to cheat for another week, we eventually worked things out. About a year into the relationship I realized Cam had a r*pe fetish, and this tied into previous abuse I had gone through, I guess allowing it to happen from a consensual standpoint kind of allowed me to have my power back, and being that really my only previous sexual experiences had been abusive, pretty heavy stuff was the only thing that could get me going. Unfortunately consent became a bit of a blurred line in the relationship, and Cam became a bit.. More aggressive I guess over time. There‚Äôs been 3 incidents I can think off of the top of my head that really fucked me up, I remember crying after, and Cam realizing what he had done. Long story short, things became a bit abusive over time. Not just on Cam‚Äôs side although I never broke anything of his or sexually abused him, I have had my moments of getting physical out of frustration or grief.

Moving along, after we moved to the city I started working for my estranged family members billion dollar company as he was operating from where we moved to, I build a relationship with him and begin realizing my family had just filled my head with negative bullshit over the years to keep me separated from him as revenge (like I said they were toxic) and I start to really care for this estranged family member, we‚Äôll refer to him as K, we started to rebuild our relationship. Things are going well, I even get Cam working with the company, and 6 months into this new life venture I end up finding out this family member was secretly using heroin. I had been close with everyone in the company for years as my father also works for this company, and one of the guys ended up having a falling out with K, and asked me to come over to talk this was normal as I smoked weed with all of the guys from work many times over the years, long story short this guy had hidden motives, I ended up going over fucked up on Xanax and ended up getting r###d again 

Cam found out about this the night it happened and came to this guys apartment with K, and police. I was too fucked up to fully understand what was going on, the guy that assaulted me had kept me in a corner away from everyone and the police talked to me separately and idiotically came to the conclusion I wasn‚Äôt in danger and was of age so they left me even though I was too high to even speak properly. 

I come to around four AM, realize what happened, find my phone and book an Uber home, I see K had been texting me all night trying to pick me up, and I get home to a frantic and concerned Cam who stayed with me and held me for the entire night. I wake up the next morning and go brush my teeth, as I see a text msg from the man who assaulted me the previous night stating K had passed away last night after everything happened. After he left the apartment that night he went home and OD‚Äôd.

I just remember screaming at the top of my lungs and Cam running to the bathroom to comfort me. Things were a blur for a good month after that, drink after drink, smoke after smoke, and pill after pill. My irresponsible, abusive, intolerable father was then placed in charge. Cam and I‚Äôd best friend Ben who also worked for the company, knew K for eleven years before he passed away and basically started the company with K so he was obviously crushed when he passed away. We all started partying hard to deal with it stupid, I know, party the pain of an over dose away. And it was stupid because six months later Ben died from the same shit too. We were lucky Cam and I were doing the same drugs but some how didn‚Äôt meet the same fate as our best friend. A few months after that, Cam and I celebrate our three year anniversary with some takeout and call it a night  

After losing Ben Cam and I started having more problems, what I didn‚Äôt yet fully know was BPD got more severe, we started fighting more, &amp;amp; the only other friend I had left was living in a completely different country, Ben was gone. Things got really rough, I ended up having another suicide attempt, back to the psych ward, only this time I got officially diagnosed with BPD, and got put on proper medication, and was given proper resources for therapy.  Later on my other best friend who was living in another country ended up wanting to move back, &amp;amp; she made it seem like she missed me and wanted to be there for me through this shit pile. Long story short Cam and I move her out here, 6 years of friendship to down the drain because she ends up being an absolute snake, shit talks me to cam multiple times, lies, screws both of us over, etc, etc, so we kick out her and our personal problems continue. Fast forward (I am doing A LOT of skipping because I doubt anyone even wants to read this far anyways, trying to keep it short lol) and now we‚Äôre living separately, I‚Äôm applying for disability, Cam left our apartment, moved into his parents temporarily, and now I‚Äôm scrambling to find a place for myself and our 4 pets (we have 7 he‚Äôs taking the other 3) by Jan first, but I don‚Äôt have enough money to rely on just myself, I‚Äôve been sick with endometriosis for two years now, and Cam took the brunt of the financial load, so now I‚Äôve been left with no option but to rent with my heroin addict father and take the basement suite, but I‚Äôm panicking because I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll find a place in time, I‚Äôm sad because Cam left me to go to his parents and I‚Äôm now spending the holidays by myself, K and Ben have both passed away, and neither of them are here anymore, the girl I thought was my best friend is living with my father and spending Christmas with him (long story) and things are just an absolute mess. If you‚Äôve made it this far thank you for reading all of this I‚Äôm sure it was a lot.. I‚Äôm on and off my meds cause I can‚Äôt afford them right now, and suicide has been a super prevalent thought.. every time I think of K and Ben I get this creeping feeling that I‚Äôm going to be next and that scares the shit out of me. Im so stressed out, I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. 

I left out a lot here.

I'm a survivor of depression and continue to battle anxiety on a day to day basis. Medicated on 100mg of sertraline since like march and before that 150mg since october 2020. My mood has improved beyond recognition. Confidence at an all tiem high. No s\*\*\* thoughts attempts harm nothing of the sort.

&#x200B;

But I am concerned...concerned that I'm potentially getting into harmful patterns.

&#x200B;

First sort of ""addiction"". Masturbation. I have a massive sex drive and I sometimes masturbate 6 or more times a day. Struggle to go a day or even a few hours without doing it. In the past I have tried to procure sex from all sorts of websites though not really now but I do continue to try and pursue relationships because I want companionship but also sex. I get frustrated when I can't cum, I feel like I have to do it in order to relax and often won't g et  to sleep until I've done it.

&#x200B;

Secondly. exercise. Gym has been a big part of my recovery. But now I think I might actually be  becoming addicted to it. For the first time, yesterday I went to the gym twice in a day. I went again tonight. Even after coming back ,I awnt to be there again. I go there not just to exercise but also to get away after I get stressed, often in recent days its been struggles with online dating and I take out my frustration there at the gym. Sometimes I box, run and go to teh gym all in one day though albeit this is rare. At night I often can't get to sleep or feel like I have to do exercise. I went to the gym tonight just for that reason - because I felt like all I'd done was sit down all day and felt I had to be active. In some ways I think I'm just replacing the addiction I have for masturbation and sexual gratification with another. 

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I can't exactly talk about the first ""addiction"" if it is that very easily, and for the second people probably won't even take it seriously. I used to drink unsocially, though never an addict though at the peak of my depression sometimes I'd literally swig some whisky in before school just to get me through the day. Never done drugs. So conventional addiction I don't have. I'd appreciate some advice on what to do from here, thank you",6

I‚Äôm not an addict myself, atleast not to substances, but I‚Äôm here so that I can better understand what my fianc√© is going through. 

My fianc√© is addicted to heroine, we have 3 kids, and his addiction started early this year after a hurricane destroyed our home. 
To be clear, my fianc√© has always been an addict. Before the hurricane he had kicked a pill habit, and before I met him he used to do lots of cocaine. 

He hid his addictions from me when we first got together and by the time I found out, I already loved him and was invested. 

Now, I feel like I‚Äôve lost my best friend. I feel like he also feels like he has lost himself, which is even more heartbreaking. 

In April my fianc√© overdosed with a friend in the house and the paramedics were called and he was shot with narcan twice. 
I asked the dr in the hospital to send him to rehab/a mental facility. He really didn‚Äôt want to go, but I knew it was for the best. 
Insurance only kept him in there for a week. But he had that week to sober up. I recognized him again, his skin wasn‚Äôt gray, his eyes weren‚Äôt sunken in, he was glowing. 

It didn‚Äôt take long before he relapsed, of course. I know heroin is a super difficult drug to kick. 

He has stolen money from my bank account, spent our rent money, stole from his mother etc.
I‚Äôve been trying to push him to get clean, and he says he wants to, but he does nothing to stop. 
He says he wants to spend Christmas with his kids and then go to rehab in January. 

In the meantime, he keeps quitting, withdrawing, and then caving. Over and over again. His doctor has prescribed him suboxone before, which he did great with, but he hasn‚Äôt asked for more.

How do I handle this? How should I react when I‚Äôve found out he‚Äôs been using or I find his drugs stashed away in our closet? 
I don‚Äôt want to make the situation worse, I don‚Äôt want to make him feel like I‚Äôm against him, because I know that it‚Äôs easy to feel like the world is against you in the midst of addiction. 

Tonight I found his heroin remnants in foil. He begged me to let him keep it and that he was ‚Äúweaning‚Äù and was smoking the remnants to keep from having horrible withdrawals. I don‚Äôt even know how to handle that and it just feels strange to say,‚Äùokay, you can keep your heroin.‚Äù But I also know that strong withdrawals can be fatal. 


Can someone PLEASE offer me some advice. 

Im trying to be supportive of getting him sober, I‚Äôm trying to get him the help he needs, I feel so lost.",2

I feel like im a different fkn person when i'm gambling and it's just like a ghost almost like a demon or something entering me when i'm gambling. Sorry for sounding dramatic or ""weird"" but i don't what the fuck is happening :(.

So i've been gambling almost constantly for about 9-10 months now and bless me i'm only 300$+ down overall but i can see this increasing quite a bit if i don't stop but HOW?!?!?!

Lets take a example from the last week: Just came back from a 1-2 weeks of not implusively gambling (only taking free bonus money from the casino etc.). At this point i'm proud for not being hooked for atleast 1-2 weeks. I'm thinking i can place a little risky parlay with my friends so we split it. We ended up winning that parlay and i won 150$ from it and was so happy because i could finally half my losses. After that i thought nothing of it until i started winning more parlays and started to think it was ""smart"" to go play and spin blackjack and slots. I ended up losing half of it. This happend on two-three ocassions. I just thought whatever probably just gonna win it back on a parlay or something. Long story short i fucking didn't. Just today i wasted over a 110$+ which is a lot for me and wondered what the fuck is going on? Because i can't stop myself.

This is an developing addiction which is already really bad but can turn into something a lot worse

I haven‚Äôt even been drinking or doing coke or anything like that. To be honest though I feel very conflicted on whether or not I want to get sober. I honestly kind of want to just go out and destroy my life with all my old friends, but also can‚Äôt bear the thought of putting my family through all of this again. That being said, I think we all know that we need to want to get sober for ourselves and not for other people. I spoke to my parents months ago about what they want me to do if I relapsed. Pretty much they want me to be honest and tell them I relapsed. Next they want to know if I want to stay sober or not. If I don‚Äôt want to stay sober they‚Äôll give me a few days to move out and if I do want to stay sober they‚Äôll help me get clean again. I‚Äôve also made around 30k in the last 3 years so they‚Äôd hold onto it and give it to me in small increments so I don‚Äôt get myself killed spending all the money on drugs at once. I don‚Äôt know why, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell them I relapsed and don‚Äôt want to get clean again. Any advice would be appreciated. Sorry for the novel and sorry if some of this didn‚Äôt make sense as I‚Äôm pretty high at the moment.

At the moment, my partner is out of town and I have 2 nights alone in my apartment. Growing up I got into some trouble for various reasons (mainly taking whatever pills/drugs i could get my hands on) and ended up going to a substance abuse counselor around the age of 16. From there I gradually reintroduced things like alcohol and weed back in around college and just after, thinking that I had it totally under control. 

Now I'm 28 and have had a cocaine habit, and am having trouble with habitual weed usage. I have a ton of self control when my partner is around or even other people but i cant help this feeling that the moment someone isn't around that I want to use. Without even thinking about it I keep mental tabs on all of the different (prescribed and illicit) drugs that are in our home and i hate the feeling. I feel like every time I'm alone I have an urge to break the rules or do something bad just because I'm alone. I have a great job and live a really happy and fulfilling life, but will these nights alone ever get any easier? I don't even really like drinking but I felt like having a whisky tonight and I'm not sure where else that will lead. 

Does anyone else struggle with this feeling of needing to do something bad when they're alone? Why do I want to drink when I'm alone but not when my partner is around? I still feel like I have so much guilt and shame from when I was so much younger and I'm just not sure how to let it go i guess.",3

Well, she found straws very recently and is wanting to have an intervention on Christmas. My girlfriend is looking for advice as she has limited resources available to get advice for this sort of situation.

Is there any other suggestions you can think of that might help her and her family help this young man?

I've installed website blockers. That proved to be futile because my horny self learned how to manually override them through the phone itself. 

I've installed a sobriety tracker. Useless. Only makes me more ashamed just seeing my relapses stack up higher and higher. 

I've done everything else I can to improve myself as a person. Going to the gym, taking cold showers, focusing on my college studies, developed a better hygiene routine, becoming more social, etc. This is the one burden I can't kick. 

I'm hesitant to talk to a therapist in fear that those around will find out about my struggle and will either take it as a joke or think I'm some disgusting pervert. 

I've been watching porn since I was around 11 or 12. As a kid I didn't really think it would affect me this badly.

Fast forward. I'm now 18 and I can barely get through the day without masturbating to some hot and spicy videos. I'm now only really excited when it involves some sort of freaky BDSM shit. I can't even ejaculate from my partner alone - I always have to finish myself off at the end of sex.",0

Earlier I was also doing hard drugs every weekend and had a pretty strong nicotine addiction. Now I'm completely sober and dont really have any cravings for earlier mentioned substances. 

Problem is: my life still revolves around pleasure coming from outwards. When I wake up I drink large amounts of coffee so I can get that nice caffeine buzz. After that wears out, I start waiting for lunch because food feels good for a moment too. Next buzz to wait for is going jogging and last thing of a day must be energy drink because it gives me the biggest pleasure at the moment, so it would make me feel a bit down if I drank it earlier. 

Like its the same thing it was before, but with a lot healthier habits. I cant live in the moment because im always waiting for the next pleasurable moment. It is literally just like I was restlessly waiting for the weekend to have a drug bender and walking circles in my room killing time before I can smoke next hits. It is tiring.

I had a good childhood and my life is going well and blah blah... I really cant figure out what might be the reason behind the constant need for pleasure.",10

For about 5 years now, I've eaten 2-3 180g blocks (3.5 Oz for Americans) of chocolate a week. My choice of poison is Cadbury. But if I'm desperate, I'll reach for Nestle.

It all began after the death of my mum when I was 10, every time my dad when shopping he would bring home a whole block for me and my sister. Was it a means to cheer us up? I don't know. I can't remember asking for it. But it was only once a week or so. It was controlled by my dad, I had no say on how frequently he give it to me or not because it was just a treat that came with the shopping. 

I was fine for a while and then I hit my senior year of high school and I began buying my own chocolate as a pick me up during study. It's all been downhill from there.

Despite how much chocolate I eat, I'm not actually that fat. I've always been pretty petite. But I'm certainly chubbier now. I went to the dentist and they told me I had 3 cavities in my teeth that need to be fixed asap. 

When I told them I was addicted to chocolate, they laughed at me. Probably because of how commonly people diagnose themselves as chocoholics. I told her it wasn't a joke and it's debilitating. I watched her face go from laughter to dawning horror of what I was telling her. I'm a dentist's worst nightmare. 

I want to save money and lose weight doing it, truly but I just get this need to go to the store and buy the chocolate. Whether it's on the way back from work or literally finding an excuse to go. When I eat it, I eat it in my room away from other people, like a rat. I can finish a block within 10 minutes. 

Stuff I've been feeling as a result- 
- Indigestion
- The sensation of waking up with vomit in the back of my throat I have to swallow back down. 
- Loss of appetite
- Tiredness when not eating the chocolate
- Tooth sensitivity
- Cavities 
- Weight gain 
- Shortness of breath
- Financial stress over buying the chocolate. 
- Irritability without it 

It's so stupid and I want to change but I don't know how. There's one strategy I've been trying recently and that's having Nutella on wholegrain toast every morning. It gives me that chocolate hit while also giving my body some fibre. When I eat it, I've found I'm actually less likely to polish off an entire block of chocolate in one sitting, in fact I may even not have chocolate that day at all. Its not perfect but it's a start especially considering I never used to eat breakfast to begin with. 

Do you have any advice?",4

I went a bit wild with my newfound freedom. I had used cocaine occasionally throughout my life up till that point, and I had always loved it. A friend who lived in my hometown happened to know someone who was selling really good stuff for cheap, and so him and I started using on weekends. This escalated over the next couple months from a couple gs to a quarter ounce or more. I make really good money so I was buying it all, and I always called my same buddy to do it with. 

Fast forward to 6 months in and him and I are on a particularly bad binge of probably a half ounce. At this point I am in pretty constant pain from my nose being raw, and our habit is beginning to spill over into weekdays. Whatever I ever bought I split down the middle and gave him his half to do as he pleases because he always preferred to cook it and smoke as opposed to snorting. Well, I ran out of my half before he did and started jonesing and decided to try smoking since he had some left. From there it went down hill very fast for three months before I admitted to myself that I had a problem. It took so long because I was (and am) so good at hiding it. My parents have no clue, I‚Äôm only excelling even more at work and making more money which doesn‚Äôt help my situation, and my friends don‚Äôt know except my buddy I‚Äôm using with who I got addicted along side me.

I am now three months past this very dark place in my life, however I still am using (just not as much) and I still have no ability to say no. I can go several weeks without using and then I‚Äôll relapse again. I know that one day ill get to where i want to be but it‚Äôs just so goddamn hard. I want to get out of this before i cause myself permanent damage or fuck up everything I have going for me right now. I already wasted the last year of my life and threw away at least $30k.

I have a friend in Myrtle beach where I‚Äôm taking him to and his mom is a wonderful lady always trying to help anyone she can get on their feet.

After a couple of weeks on a monday we went to his place after work, that night we took 5 xtc pills and snorted ¬Ωg of coke each. It was a nice experience for the both of us. A few days ago we were talking about that night and we ended up arranging for us to do it again. 
I'm going to his apartment tomorrow night for about three days. We planned about 4g of coke and 15 pills (xtc & other amph's) each, adding up to around 710‚Ç¨ (~800$). After this i'm planning to focus on my studies and my future and i hope the path to becoming clean won't be to difficult.",3

So first of all I am not going through near what a lot of people on this sub are going through. My deepest sympathy lies with them and I hope they find the help they need.

I am 18 and I‚Äôve always knew I have an addictive personality ever since I started playing video games from young. I feel as if I crave a lot of things. These things are usually things that give me a short term high‚Ä¶ a dopamine hit‚Ä¶ something that makes me feel comfortable.

With turning 18, a lot of independence comes your way and you want to try new things and form your own identity. These are all the things I feel I am in the first stages of an addiction with and I struggle to stop doing. Here are all of my unhealthy habits. 

Weed - I tried it not long ago and I loved the feeling. So I pretty much do weed every time I can get my hands on it. It‚Äôs like I want to be high all the time. 

Vaping - Never smoked in my life before half a year ago and now I can‚Äôt go a day without puffing on my vapes. It‚Äôs became natural to me now and I‚Äôve tried to stop, but I can‚Äôt. Everyone around me smokes so the temptation is always there. I can‚Äôt imagine the damage it‚Äôs doing to my health. 

Phone - I have no attention span and become impatient when I haven‚Äôt looked on my phone in a while. It prevents me from being productive and happy.

Snus/ Niccotine/ Tobacco pouches - Some may have never heard of these. But they make me relaxed and I can‚Äôt go a day without snus. I want it all the time just so I can feel a little different. 

Porn - An addiction not taking seriously in society, but probably my biggest habit. Everyday, more than once. It‚Äôs fucked up my brain but once I get the urge I can‚Äôt help myself.

Alcohol - I live in the UK. The drinking culture is really bad. I don‚Äôt drink everyday but I couldn‚Äôt stop if I tried. 

Overall, I‚Äôve developed so many unhealthy habits at such a young age, making me really scared for what lies ahead in the future. I guess I‚Äôm chasing short term highs constantly. I say I won‚Äôt do any other drugs than weed but how do I know I can trust myself? How can I be expected to stop when all my friends do these things ? Every time I‚Äôve attempted to stop I give up within a day.",2

I‚Äôm a 23 year old guy, been smoking since I probably just turned 18 and it‚Äôs been a daily if not every other day routine since. I‚Äôve had a few breaks here and there, the longest I can remember was 2 weeks (got the sweats etc) before I just went back to regularly using.
 
I‚Äôve wanted to quit for the guts of a year now but just can‚Äôt. I know you can‚Äôt get addicted to it, but I‚Äôve tried to recognise the situations and triggers that cause me to smoke but I still don‚Äôt have the mental strength to stop. Things like: after a hard work shift, playing the PlayStation or watching a show, long drives and other activities I do outdoors, all seem to require me to smoke.

Alongside this, I‚Äôm a student. I know this will most likely affect my future. I graduate May 2022 and it needs to stop before my final semester, I need to get into the professional frame of mind I‚Äôll have to have once I finish uni. My friends all smoke, some of them so regularly and in excess that it‚Äôs a problem, being in a country where it‚Äôs not legalised it makes it all the less worth it in terms of risk money and social views on it, yet we still do.

I‚Äôd love to hear some pointers, relatable stories or suggestions. I‚Äôve smoked my last joint tonight, this is it. If I can stay sober from alcohol for a year now I can do this surely?

2021-12-16 13:18:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rhwm9p/im_tired_of_being_trapped_by_my_own_addictions/,I'm tired of being trapped by my own addictions,"I guess its been like that forever. It hasn't gotten me in trouble legally, (haven't had drugs or alcohol yet). The earliest I remember was when I used to be addicted to TV. I didn't have much to do, I had no one to be with since everyone around me was busy with something and I wasn't allowed to roam freely as much due to my parent's overprotectiveness. What replaced that was something much worse. 

The internet.

It shaped who I am as a person, filled the empty numbness I had in my life. It did destroy a lot of things in my life though. I couldn't focus on my hobbies, and other aspects of my life, (sadly, I'm socially inept, and incredibly irresponsible for my age). Eventually, though I learned a lot from the internet, I am incredibly behind everyone my age. 

In particular, I wasted most of my time in YouTube. Since I turned 10 however, I turned to one particular type of content. I remember, for nearly 2 years, I was obssesed with watching gacha videos, (as embarrassing it is to admit). It got really bad during quarantine when  I would watch those videos instead of doing anything else. I knew I was going down a dark spiral, so I did the only thing I could think of to get rid of my gacha addiction.

Getting hooked on something worse. 

Around then, I would always get ads for Lenzhin,. In particular, I would get recommended a lot of bls. As terrible as it sounds, I used to fetishize gay men which started shortly after watching a couple of gacha bl stories. After finding one Yaoi, I started looking for a website where I could read it for free. When I found a website, I started initiating my plan. Rather watching gacha, I would read yaoi manwhas, and eventually, mangas.

It worked in the beginning. I was even starting to get my life back together, because for some reason, I felt motivated. I initially wanted to quite after finishing up this particular series. However, when I did finish, I was already trapped in my addiction. That summer, I think I finished about 16 different yaois. I always made plans to stop, but I never actually did. 

Funnily enough, I think I stopped my fetishizing after I started getting into yaoi. I guess a lot had to do with the community threads I would read. I would read a lot  of yaoi. Some were pure porn, and somewhere legitimately actual stories. I got over the toxic stereotypes quick, and even the smut didn't affect me much. From the looks of it, I read these stories to cope, even if I don't find any enjoyment in it.

It's not noticeable, but I feel like I am wasting away, with only just reading yaoi, day in and day out. I could be doing so many things, and I am starting to see it affect my routine, which affects what I do during day, and my social interactions. Plus, I don't want this to be my sole hobby.

A lot of my addictions stem from coping with my current situation. Doing other things helped temporarily, but weren't that impactful in the long run. I could get into something worse, but with the way this going, I could sink lower than ever. I don't know what to do, and I really wish I wasn't so lethargic and reluctant to change.",2

I‚Äôm struggling with schizophrenia at the moment and I‚Äôm horribly addicted to cocaine and marijuana. I‚Äôve smoked daily since 2015 and I‚Äôve been hooked on the cocaine since 2019. It‚Äôs literally ruining my life and I feel like I can‚Äôt stop unless I‚Äôm taken out of my environment. I‚Äôm live in a bad area and I‚Äôm surrounded by drugs all the time. I only go out once a week to try to force myself to socialize. I know I‚Äôm letting everyone down but this has been the only thing that makes me happy. The feeling right after I buy it and use it. So happy. And I‚Äôve never been happy. I‚Äôve struggled with mental health issues since early childhood and grew up with alcoholics. I just don‚Äôt have a lot of hobbies and I never have the energy to do anything if I‚Äôm not on cocaine. I know this is because of the drugs but I‚Äôm just losing control. Just having a rough night. Hope you are all doing better than I with your addictions this evening. It‚Äôs so hard and it sucks.,13

Do I give him an ultimatum?,"Last Year, I (f24) fell into addiction after a traumatic breakup. A person I met while using (m34) and I developed a close relationship over the next 6 months and kept trying to get sober together (yeah dumb) but inevitably would relapse after a few days, sometimes making it a few weeks sober. By Late august we spiralled pretty bad together and I made the decision to cut him out of my life so I could actually get clean.

I care VERY much about him. I have tried not to worry but I have been worried sick these last 3 months I‚Äôve been sober. I think about him all the time. We live in an area where meth is cut with fentinol very often and people are dropping like flies.

Last Week, I got the phone call from a friend. He had overdosed on meth laced with fent and was just released from hospital. Frantically, I went straight to his house and spent the night with him post overdose. He had been on a month long binge and was in bad shape. 

While I was there, his parents showed up. He was a complete ass to them and pretty everyone else who has tried to reach out to him who isn‚Äôt an addict. 

His parents took my number because it was obviously he and I are close. I left the next day, and he overdosed again that same day.

Now I am simply terrified to lose him. I made a mistake by telling his family I would try to convince him to get clean. They are relying on me heavily to be the communicator with him. He will not talk to them or any help we are trying to get him. He‚Äôs been sober now for 3 days but not showing signs of wanting to stay that way. I‚Äôve been making him meals (is this a mistake?) and keeping the fire going for him.

Clearly I am questioning whether I should be babying him or not when he hasn‚Äôt made the decision to get clean. I am sick at the thought of telling his family that I am walking away, and he ends up dying. 

I know this is his choice. I feel sick with stress. I love him so much but he is not accepting help in a meaningful way and doesn‚Äôt seem to have the desire to get sober. He had a life before this. He‚Äôs losing the beautiful house he owns and is declaring bankruptcy. He has only been an addict for 2 years. 

I cannot continue babysitting someone who refuses to get clean. Right? Should I give him an ultimatum? ‚Äú I am removing contact with you until you make the decision to get clean‚Äù what if he dies right after? :( help.",3

I‚Äôm interested in others‚Äô opinions.

(FYI: This is my first Reddit post, so if this isn‚Äôt the proper sub-reddit, please let me know. I‚Äôm interested in hearing as many (polite) opinions as possible.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Let‚Äôs take opiate addiction, as an example.**

I was looking into what *up/down-regulation* is, and, without a sophisticated understanding of human biology/pharmacology, it would seem to me that, for instance, a substance taken excessively for an extended period of time that affects the opiate receptors would eventually down-regulate the opiate receptors in the body, causing what we know as *tolerance* (I don‚Äôt know if this is a pharmacological definition of 'tolerance')*.*

This *tolerance* (AKA down-regulation of the relevant receptors) causes you to feel *absolutely terrible* when you‚Äôre not artificially raising your body‚Äôs levels of some compound which contains/promotes generation of mu-opioids (pardon if this is not how the body exactly works).

Thus, because each individual cell (I‚Äôm not sure how up/down-regulation works in the brain. Does it affect synapses?) has less of these receptors, and opioids are obviously an integral part of the body‚Äôs pain/feeling system (Is there a name for this?), so they are already constantly being received by these receptors at a natural level, your cells are less capable of promoting experiencing that system (the opioid system, in this case) as your body was designed to.

*Withdrawals*, namely post-acute-withdrawals (PAWs), would then officially cease once the cells in your body have up-regulated back to natural levels and equalized (not cravings, as I believe those are linked to subconscious routines, which promote conscious thought (go take a drink cause you‚Äôre 'watching the game', or whatever, and you've done that for 40 years), which you develop over the course of your addiction/life).

&#x200B;

I‚Äôd love some thoughts on these ideas, but really would like to know the current state of understanding of physical addiction. I have no idea if these are already disproven ideas, cause it seems like a natural conclusion when you understand physical addiction and have a basic understanding of up/down-regulation.

He had a lot of medical issues, and had surgery on his arm for nerve pain. He has troubles sleeping and has a week immune system. On these meds post surgery, he was still taking Xanax and who knows what else. I found him overdosing at his computer with powder on his desk and a cut up straw. The ambulance came, and he was in the hospital for a few days.

My parents and i cleaned out his room because we were so worried after and found tons of things that we weren‚Äôt expecting: tons of bags, cut up straws, dmt residue, kratom, Xanax, heroin residue, etc.

It happened a second time at his girlfriends house a month later. She didn‚Äôt know about the severity of his drug use, she couldn‚Äôt bear to see him that way so they broke up, and she ended up moving into the apartment they signed a lease for, without him.

He agreed to see a psychologist, but he only went once and never returned. He seemed to be doing better, he was going to the gym a bit, spending quality time with my parents and myself (even though we weren‚Äôt close growing up). However we recently noticed a large number of new bags that had heroin in them popping up, he has very little money considering he makes a decent living and has little expenses, and today he said he has been having trouble sleeping and having very vivid nightmares that he was in jail. Hours after waking, he was still convinced that what had happened in his nightmares was real. He was convinced he was in jail despite the fact he hasn‚Äôt actually left the house in 3 days (He‚Äôs currently in the hospital now).

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is my parents and i are extremely worried. We love him very much, but how can we help? My parents find it difficult because they can‚Äôt exactly control him given that he‚Äôs 24, and they can‚Äôt monitor what he does. They don‚Äôt want to kick him out because that will make things worse. I understand that many people going through this sort of thing are not comfortable talking about it. I just want him to be better but don‚Äôt know how to help more than telling him i love him regularly and that I‚Äôm here for him anytime. I reached out to a psychologist specialized in addiction to talk about this stuff, but figured i might get some good advice here.

This is purely my opinion and the way I have been feeling, I know its different for us all though, maybe some will relate...
 
Addiction, an unrecognised disease, can't talk about it, or ask for the help you desperately need.
Afraid of being judged and pushed to one side, the pain and suffering you have no choice to hide.
But the more you try and hide it the worse things get, you get hooked even more despite the regret.

Feeling like a criminal, that's how society makes us feel.
When all we want to do is talk, get better and heal. I know I have friends and a beautiful family, but I can't bring myself to tell them. Maybe it's my ego, my pride or maybe I'm just to 'manly'. I use quotation marks because that phrase is kinda dumb, But it's what I'm told all the time, no wonder I feel numb. I'm the man people turn to,
If only they fucking knew. I can't even help myself so how the fuck can I help you.

Hope you like it, hope some can relate. Love to every last one of you that have commented on my previous posts, you have helped incredibly.",16

My last post was seeking advice, this time I just wanna get some things off my chest through the anonymity of the internet since I wanna keep this private irl.

So for those of you who missed it, I (25m) found my boyfriend's (24m) stash of crack (though I didn't know what it was at the time). I made the post as he went out to go buy more. After he got back he went straight back to the bathroom and I decided to leave for a while. I got in my car and aimlessly drove around the city almost all night. I called in work yesterday because I needed to sleep.

I confronted him about what I found and calmly but sternly demanded an explanation. He explained that it was crack and his mother got him hooked when he was 14.

He tearfully confessed the whole story. His mother was mostly absent as he was a kid. This I knew of before but I just assumed she was a shitty parent but I never knew it was this bad. When he was 14, she showed him how to smoke it and he almost instantly became an addict. He went from a straight a student to barely passing each grade level. And it only got worse when he came out as bi to a family that didn't support him. He used crack to alleviate the stress.

When he finally moved out, he was able to go to rehab. And while that wasn't a cure-all, being away from his toxic family and focusing on himself helped him seriously decrease his usage and even quit for a while. It was in this time period that we met and got together. A year later we would move in together.

He said he's been clean ever since until about three months ago. A lot has been going on for both of us and while I won't go into the details here, the stress was enough to get him using again.

I went away again for a few hours to process this information. When I got back, he was still crying and begging me not to leave him, that he would get rid of his hitters, delete his dealer's number, whatever it took. I told him I wouldn't leave him so long as he made an effort to stop and never use again. After all, he bested it once, he could do it again. I told him I wanted him to go to rehab. He reluctantly agreed.

I drove him over to be admitted about two hours ago. Now I'm just sitting in our apartment with nothing but my thoughts. It'll be weeks, maybe even a month before he's back. I'm gonna miss him. I love him.

But I'm also pissed as fuck at him. He told me why didn't tell me- he thought i'd immediately leave him if I knew. Does he really think that little of me? That I would abandon someone I've been so close to for years cuz of his past or a bump in the road? Instead venting to me about his stress, he thought goddamn crack cocaine was a better option?!

Normally, he's honest to a fault. Seriously, I have had to tell him to not be so honest sometimes- people don't always wanna hear the truth, that's why white lies exist. And it's because of this honesty that, before I found his stash, when I asked him what was going on, instead of lying he simply didn't answer. And when I asked again telling him what I found, though he hesitated, he explained everything. His truthfulness is part of the reason I love him.

But apparently, his own wellbeing is the only exception to his no-lying moral code. I don't know if it's because he didn't trust me, thought I would leave him, didn't wanna burden me or what the fuck ever, I feel so insulted and hurt that he didn't come to me when he needed it. I know it probably wasn't meant to be something personal but goddamn it I'm taking it personally.

I think some time apart will be good for both of us. I can cool down while he can cope and stay sober. When he gets back, things are gonna be tough. But it will be nice to see him again. I do kinda already miss him. Ugh, emotions are so complicated. How can I not wanna see his face but also want nothing but to see his face at the same time?

Well, I guess I'm done ranting. One thing I know for sure is that seemed sincere when he said he would stop so that neither of us would have to worry about this anymore. After all, like I said, he's generally very trustworthy. And I love who he is as a person, not some stupid addiction.",4

Grocery shopping..dope bag, walking down the street..dope bag, even going to the methadone clinic for my daily dose before work..dope bag.

Every time I see a dope bag, my response isn‚Äôt anger or anything like that. I can feel someone‚Äôs pain, heartbreak and sense of loneliness, because any of those bags could of been mine and no one wakes up one day and says ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm gonna try shooting up heroin or fentanyl today‚Äù. That‚Äôs not how addiction works, addiction comes from pain and suffering and the feeling that someone didn‚Äôt think that they had a choice or anyway out of their situation. Don‚Äôt be harsh on the guy begging for money, the one that keeps slipping up on their road to recovery and stop being harsh on yourself. If no one has told you today, I love you and you are so worth it to be on this planet just like the rest of us. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you, you are just full of pain and hurt that you don‚Äôt understand or can explain or deal with properly and if you see that dope bag at your job interview, walking to the store or anywhere you may go. Don‚Äôt feel mad or angry, be happy that you had the will power and the strength to actually want to get clean and proud of how far you got on the road to your recovery. Maybe try throwing it away, so the next person, who might not be as strong as you, can keep having the time to build up that kinda strength and restraint from using. I love you all and please keep up the great work.",16

He had a heroin addiction that he overcame 11 years ago. We've been together for 10 - married for 6.  Throughout our relationship, there were a few (3) instances we he relapsed with other substances, but they were all short lived and occurred after traumatic experiences. I learned to recognize the triggers and usage signs quickly.  He has for the most part been open and honest with me once he was caught and helpful in explaining the addictive person's mind.  I recently found out that he was abusing prescription drugs.  He had told me about the prescription (before he obtained it), but I didn't know it could be abused.  We began having relationship issues and after constantly confronting him knowing something was off, he finally fessed up. He was using 5x the recommended dosage of a stimulant.  He quit cold turkey, but picked it back up 6 months later. I knew he was using again, but when I confronted him he lied and vehemently denied it...which was new.  In the past, he might evade or lie to me, but once confronted, he'd fess up.  My problem is, that this last stint occurred after the miscarriage of our second child.  I was actually accusing him of cheating, because all the signs were  there....he wouldn't communicate with me, was working long hours, became impotent and couldn't look me in the eyes if we did actually have sex.  Sex is a big part of our relationship, so I thought infidelity was the culprit. This time, I'm struggling to believe that the drug addiction was the only lie, because if you can lie about that, then you can lie about infidelity too, right?  Please note I have a history of insecurity issues and sexual abuse as a child and he has addiction and abandonment issues (lots of baggage...I know)

To provide some back story, we had separated 2 years ago after he became verbally, emotionally and psychologically abusive.  I would counter with the same energy, so please don't assume I'm trying to paint myself as this innocent angel.  The toxic abuse cycle began immediately after we brought our first child home. I suffered severe post partum depression as well, which didn't help either of us.  He continually told me I was a terrible wife and a useless worthless mother after I also was told that I needed to do all chores in the house since he paid MOST of the bills.  I worked full time and didn't make as much, but still paid bills too. He was obsessed with working out, was always taking extra work shifts, continually told me how horrible I was and just seemed to hate me, so I thought he was cheating which he aggressively denied.   In hindsight, he may have been just using then too.  We separated 2 years later (my choice not his).  We were going to counseling and it took ALOT of work on both sides, but we eventually mended our relationship and found love and trust again. Fast forward 7 months and we had a miscarriage, that's when he began abusing the prescription with all the other baggage as mentioned above  and my insecure thoughts of infidelity occuring became all consuming.  I began hearing voices over the phone thinking there was another person he was with. I believed I heard a woman telling him to hang up on occasions when he sounded high out of his mind and one call made me believe I had actually caught him in the throws off passion after work in which he accidentally took my call and was panting and making grunting noises and climaxing which he stated was just him going down a flight of stairs and getting into his car.  He told me I was hearing things, crazy and psychotic, which I certainly did feel, however, I've been called this before....usually when I'm onto him. He told me the issues above were all due to the drug usage, which heightened my insecurity issues and exacerbated my psychosis in which I was perceivably hearing things after obsessing about his infidelity. Mind you, my hormones were still reeling from a miscarriage as well and finding out he was abusing drugs which left me feeling as if he left me in a lurch to grieve the loss of the baby alone.  I chalked it up to his explanation, and we found out I was pregnant again a month later.  At 6 months pregnant, he began abusing a ""less addictive"" version of the prescription.  I knew he was, and confronted him which was when he lied.  I waited a week and brought it up again, and he knew I knew, so he came clean. He's been sober to my knowledge ever since and our daughter was born in November.

Now, I can't stop wondering back to that time, thinking there was something else (infidelity).  I can't stop wondering what triggered the verbal and mental abuse after the birth of our first child. Was he using or cheating then too?  I've been hearing the voices again and can't account to his whereabouts before or after work. I've even thought at one point that he's been screwing the neighbor or his best male friend and that I've actually heard them.  I'm going crazy.....there is no trust.  He came home with a rash on his face, and I just assumed he's now been inhaling chemicals to get high.  I hate this.  I'm tired of always wondering when the next shoe is going to drop and when my trust will be violated again.  My trust is so broken, and he says he can't continue this way with me constantly thinking he's doing something behind my back when he's trying so hard to be a good husband and father, which I understand.  I'm just so fed up with how this has left me second guessing him and my own sanity.  Can anyone help me process this?  Any advice on how to move past it and restore my mind and peace in our relationship? Do you think he was only abusing drugs and nothing else?",1

2021-12-13 12:14:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rfkows/opioids/,"""Opioids""","Just started a new reddit dedicated to my life mental health and addiction. I know how hard it is to be addicted trust me, my clean dates only the 28th of November which was an overdose. my addiction is Percocet's or fentanyl I should add. I've been using off and on perc's and pressed perc's for about 2-3 years now. It all started with using real perc 10's. The first time I tried them I loved the feeling but, in my head, I thought it'd be a one-time thing, man was I wrong. I always wanted to get perc 10's because they were usually the real ones, but I was also blowing money on them considering there $10 a pop. After a while the M box pressed perc 30' came around and my best friend at the time began selling them. of course, I started doing those, at first, I wasn't aware they were fake I was just popping half of one the other half later then a whole one an hour later. Then very fast the use went up and I started to snort them because they would hit harder but they would also last shorter. I started doing like 5 pills a day even more sometimes if I could afford it. all those covid checks we were getting went straight to my addiction, and me telling myself ""I'm just going to spend this much and be good for a while."" Very next day id do the same thing. Routine: wake up snort a perc, go to the bathroom, get coffee then snort another. I would snort one almost every hour then smoke on top of it. I was trying to rid myself of my own mental illness at first, then it turned into ridding myself of withdrawals and trying to just function. I was so addicted to these little blue pills. I would do them at work, do them at family gatherings, everywhere. I would always have some on me. if I didn't, I was in the house waiting to get some. It was a vicious cycle I ended up getting on suboxone. Worst part of that, I used it just to fight the withdrawals when I didn't have percs. I thought I was smart as hell when I came up with that, do percs 2-3 days in a row, do a suboxone the next day. it was a pretty good set up, until I ran out. Running out helped me in the long run I did stay clean for a couple months, but I was just substituting percs with alcohol. I still wouldn't consider myself an alcoholic because how I am addicted to percs is nothing like that. I would drink because I didn't know what else to do hours after I wake up. I'm unemployed been unemployed for 3 months now, I struggle with mental illness and alcohol took the edge off since I didn't want to do percs. the drinking went up though, I would binge drink for 2-3 days then stop but little did I know what that would trigger. The 28th I started drinking early, and it was vodka. I drank around 2-3 cups of it and got drunk. while I was drunk, I thought it'd be a great idea to get them perc's again. which is what I did, as soon as I thought of it, I got them. I was so excited I ran upstairs broke it down and snorted it. worst idea ever. not even 5 minutes later I blacked out. Unfortunately, but thankfully my mom was home and found me. I was unresponsive, face turning blue, and my heart got affected. The cops were called along with an ambulance which they administered Narcan which brought me back. I went to the hospital because of it though and also my heart was very fluttered. it was beating at 160 beats and couldn't really pump the blood through my body. thankfully I was brought back to stabilization, but that overdose put me into a mental psych ward due to my history with suicide attempts. I was in there for about 2 weeks, put on good medication, Abilify, Zoloft, naltrexone. after I was stable, I got discharged and went home. Now I'm here 4 days after my discharge still struggling with wanting to use but not giving in. it frustrates me because I just overdosed and put my mom through so much why I would want to do it again. addiction has no limits or sympathy; I wouldn't wish this on anybody. I pray everybody finds the help they need as I'm doing and fights the battle, because it's a lifelong battle, stay strong I believe we can do it.",4

I (25M) have noticed my boyfriend (24M) acting a bit strange lately. He's been open to me about his struggle with alcohol in the past, it was his way of coping with a homophobic family as a teenager. Since moving out and becoming his own person, while he still drinks, it's much less problematic.

Both our lives have increased in stress lately. We've lived together for three years and this is the first time I've noticed him pacing around weirdly, not sleeping all night, going out for hours at a time. He also seemed more secretive. At first I suspected him of cheating (and while I suppose that's still a possibility), he just now (about 20 minutes ago) left the apartment. He's been holed up in the bathroom for over an hour and suddenly declared he had to leave.

I went into the bathroom and it looked normal at first but smelled awful. After a bit of pokinb around I found a little pouch with small white rocks in it some sort of pipe. I've only ever smoked weed so I don't know what this pipe is for but it's definitely not for weed. Maybe meth? Or crack? I'm not sure.

He's still not back yet. I called, no answer. When he returns I'll leave him be. Enjoy whatever high he's on because whatever this shit is, although I don't know what specifically, it's bad and he's no gonna be able to have a reasonable conversation.

I want to know how to confront him in a few days. He's only started acting like this within about two months every few weeks or so, so I'm not worried about him doing it again for a while.

What's the best way to try to approach him on this? Please help, I'm really scared and angry. I don't want to lose him.",31
2021-12-12 16:36:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/reyxdr/does_my_fiance_have_an_alcohol_addiction_or_just/,Does my fiance have an alcohol addiction or just a problem with alcohol? What can I do now?,"Sorry for such a long post. 

I live in the UK I'm a 33-year-old woman. My fianc√© is 27 and we've been together for over two years now. When we first got together, in fact, on our first date he told me his ex forced him to go to AA meetings. He said he hated it, it was religious and he was called an alcoholic when he felt he wasn't. The ex girlfriend who pressured him to go to AA meetings also used a lot of cocaine so he found it very hypocritical.

We discussed his drinking habits and at the time I was naive. I thought that someone who doesn't drink every day or first thing every morning is not an alcoholic. I knew his ex from a brief conversation, she was... Horrid. So I gave him the benefit of the doubt and blew it off. I noticed he drank often but put it down to him being young and Irish. When we drank a lot together we began having fights. I'm not usually someone who fights when I drink.

As time went on and we moved in together I noticed he drank more often than I thought. 3-6 nights a week at least 2 cans of 4.5%-5% at a time but sometimes much more. He was drinking by himself one night and I mentioned something fairly innocuous, he became very rude and cutting, he'd never been like that before.

I told him the next day what he'd said (he had no memory of it apparently) and how he'd made me feel, he apologised and bought me flowers, but he also bought himself a lot of beer and that night it happened again. After that I realised I didn't like the way he is when he drinks and that I needed to set some boundaries.

He said he understood and that he wouldn't drink alone anymore. He didn't keep to that. There was a window of time where there was less drinking and our relationship was good. I even said to him that I'd overreacted. But then he started to have temper flares, especially when he was drinking. He has a tendency to bottle up his feelings. He began to lie about his drinking and started to put cans in the rubbish bin instead of recycling, he started helping less around the house and I was responsible for organising everything. Around this time I became a drug and alcohol recovery worker. He changed job because the previous workplace was awful and he said it was the reason he drank so much but his drinking habits didn't change with the job. 

If I tried to talk to him about how I was feeling about his behaviour he'd say ""I'm trying"" and ""it feels like nothing I do is ever good enough."" He got angry with me for bringing up his drinking all the time saying he was forced to go to AA before and he's not going to go to any alcohol support again. He said that was final and he was putting his foot down. Arguments went back and forth over the issue on and off for months. He said I was ""treating him like one of my clients"" he felt like I was watching him and judging him whenever he drank, even though I was drinking sometimes. I stopped drinking when I fell pregnant by him but had a miscarriage, he didn't stop drinking over that period either. 

He drinks really fast and if I'm not there he drinks a lot more, like he's only drinking less to make me worry less. And I have good reason to worry. One night he went out drinking with some much younger friends and after having a lot to drink he was encouraged to send threatening messages to a 17-year-old who had apparently been accused of rape by at least two girls.

The lads father was going to contact police until my fiance got in touch with him and apologised. I was utterly mortified. He even said he understood if I never wanted to see him again, we'd just got engaged. He said that day he was going to stop drinking, by the end of the day he said he was not going to label himself t-total as he still wanted to drink on special occasions. A week later he'd all but forgotten his pledge and was back to his usual habits.

He'd agreed to do sober October with me but we'd had a fight on November 30th because I called him a doughnut in front of mutual friends and apparently teased him too much, our housemate was there and said my behaviour was nothing out of the ordinary. My fiance had of course been drinking. 

On October 1st he went out drinking with his workmate, he didn't tell me he was going out or when he was going to be home. I waited until gone 8pm to cook dinner because I wasn't sure if he'd be home. I was asleep by the time he got back from the pub. He said he didn't want to come home to me because he was angry with me. He said that I always complain about his behaviour but when he complained about mine it was him being oversensitive.

I had managed to get him to look at the moderation plan I'd found. If I remember correctly it involves keeping a drink diary, then having a month sober, then having a plan for returning to drinking that includes limits and boundaries. I think he got as far as keeping a diary for the week. Arguments became inevitable when he drank, especially if we were out, over really minor infractions on my part. He had a melt down one evening when I wanted to leave a function and yet spent a long time saying goodbye to people. 

Last Thursday I went out for a work meal. I usually host a meeting every Thursday night but that night I left it with him to do. He told me not to get drunk because I needed to complete a Covid form when I got home for our flight the next day. I drank coke and tap water. When I came home the meeting was still going and he was completely drunk, 6+ cans of strong lager. I went upstairs because I was embarrassed. My housemate who chairs the meetings noticed he was incredibly drunk. He passed out before helping me with the flight forms so I had to do them the next morning.

He says he drinks to relax, to relieve stress, when he's nervous and for fun. He will drink more than the majority of people around him. He almost always lies about what he's had. The only time he drinks much less is when he gets back into weight lifting which also seems to coincide with better temperament and seemingly better mental health.

His dad has a similarly poor tolerance for alcohol but not the same temper tantrums. While we were visiting last week he drank so much he collapsed on his way to bed and my fiance had to help him to bed. The relationship between his parents is very similar to ours, she said next time he gets that drunk he can get himself to bed. I think we're both more sensitive than his parents though.

We're still engaged, still trying for a baby as long as he's sober enough to perform and I do still love him but he's still saying I judge him and he feels like I'm watching him. He even started to challenge my boundaries saying that it was judgemental of me to refuse to sleep with him when he's drunk or to avoid potential confrontation if he's only had one drink. On occasions I needed to talk to him about things I was unhappy about but I didn't because he'd been drinking but he just got angry that I was upset and not telling him why.

I will say I find the label ""alcoholic"" unhelpful. Not just for him but people on reddit kept saying I was in denial. We both know he has a drinking problem so there's no denial there but I can't determine the severity or the best way to go about it without leaving him. Most of the time he is kind and affectionate and we really enjoy each others company. Alcohol just seems to strip away his best traits and bring out the bad side, even if he's only had one or hasn't had a drink that day.

This week he's started weightlifting again. He's only had about eight cans of 4.5% though that's still more than the recommended weekly units. We've had a much better week but I'm beginning to sink into depression possibly from carrying the weight of our relationship, the household responsibilities and our joint political ventures on my shoulders. I'm embarrassed that I don't have the answers when I support several people with alcohol addiction.

Redditors typically tell me to leave him, that I'm in denial and that I need therapy because I want to make this relationship work. I will say his behaviour is very rarely abusive. He's kicked a recycling box but I've slammed a door, he's sworn at me and I've probably sworn back. I'll admit he is the escalator, I'm the descalator, almost always. But I don't think his situation is one which can only be solved through abstinence. I would absolutely support him if he were to decide he wanted to be abstinent but is there a better way?

Should I try reintroducing the moderation programme to him in the new year? Should I back off and focus on maintaining my boundaries and doing what I can for myself to be happy and healthy? I don't want to end the relationship. Is there an approach I haven't tried that might work?

Tldr: fianc√© has a drinking problem and is struggling to address it and it's hurting our relationship. I don't know what to do besides maintaining my boundaries.",6

2021-12-12 06:55:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/renknv/concerned_i_might_have_a_problem/,Concerned I might have a problem,"I was hoping I could get some advice or a different perspective about an addiction problem I think I may have. 

Disclaimer: It involves hard drugs (meth) and risky sex. Just wanted to let you guys know before reading in case it's not something that you want to read. 

So basically, around the beginning of summer I went to hook up with a stranger, they offered me meth and I accepted, though I was kinda apprehensive. But I thought that I would be fine, partially because I've done a lot of really addictive hard drugs in the past when I was younger (including meth), and had never even come close to having a problem despite being in a waaay worse place mentally. So I just thought I was a born normie. 

So I do meth with this person, but I thought to myself I'll restrict it to just a little bit of smoking, and dip as soon as I feel like I'm developing a problem. Anyways, the person turned out to be pretty chill, and they really liked me a lot so I been back a couple of times, to do meth and hook up. 

Here's where I think I've developed a problem, I don't really know how to write them out into a flowing paragraph, so I'll just list them.

1. Every time I leave these hookups, I feel like I made a bad life decision
2. I broke my rule about just smoking it, and now I'm snorting it and last time I even slammed it 
3. I'm engaging in riskier and riskier sex, and I no longer really enjoy sex sober 
4. I feel like I'm relying on the sex for validation.

And the final one that prompted me to write this post was, I was prescribed adderall and vyvanse in my early 20s for ADD, I didn't take a lot of them because it gave me anxiety so I have a bunch left.  I  dug them out about a month ago, and today I took two vyvanse with the purpose of getting high. I wouldn't say I didn't have control overt this, but once felt a little I started to take more to get more high. 

I'm not really seeking out the drug to own myself and I don't intend on buying any with my own money. And so far it hasn't really affected any of my relationships with family and friends. But I'm getting concerned that despite this, I've already lost a little control. Mainly because I feel like I'm thinking about it more, and I literally always say yes when it's offered to me now (maybe once 1-2 months). 

I guess I know that meth isn't just any cookie, it's pretty hardcore... I'm going to try to stop, but I have some anxiety right now about it. I wanted to hear some of y'all thoughts on this. 

Other things I've done besides this reddit post: I did call an addiction hotline, and e-mailed some online zoom AA meetings. The hotline was no help, and I'm waiting on the meetings.",6
2021-12-12 02:00:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rejeo9/im_addicted_to_risk_situations/,I‚Äôm addicted to risk situations,"I (32f) have schizophrenia and was previously diagnosed with bipolar. I‚Äôm a survivor of sexual assaults and have very little drive to survive anymore. I take my medication visit the doctor, etc. but I have just lost my will to live. I feel like I‚Äôm in a shell and I‚Äôm just going through the motions. Happens whenever I take antipsychotics although they seem to help otherwise. Two years ago my dad died and I got hooked on cocaine. I‚Äôve smoked weed daily for years to deal with pain and headaches. This addiction however has consumed me. If I don‚Äôt have the drugs I‚Äôm sick. If I have them I do too much and I‚Äôm sick. Alabama has very few mental health rehab facilities (I require one that takes dual diagnosis patients apparently.) I‚Äôm trying to get on disability so I can afford to pay rent and still receive the treatment I need but they just deny you for a few years. I was denied because I made $40 too much the last time I applied because we had a holiday bonus of $150. I‚Äôve been honest with my family about my situation and they are trying to be supportive but I know I‚Äôm letting that down and it just hurts so much worse. I‚Äôm also a sex worker so when I‚Äôm not poisoning myself I am putting myself into dangerous situations because I can‚Äôt afford to feed myself after I pay my bills. As a sexual assault survivor (not a victim, I won‚Äôt give them the satisfaction) it just fucks with my head more and I use more. It‚Äôs like I have no control over my rational brain. I‚Äôve gone to the hospital twice to try to get help and they weren‚Äôt able to find me a bed for days so I had to leave. I can‚Äôt afford to sit in the ER for a week when I don‚Äôt have insurance. In our state when you go into a mental health facility they treat you like a prisoner that they must keep alive. They don‚Äôt talk to you like you are an adult, they don‚Äôt have a therapist on site. They just drug you if you start displaying signs of discomfort or sadness. Most the shit you can‚Äôt even get a prescription for so what good that does for a person I will never understand. Sometimes I just hope I take enough that I fall asleep and don‚Äôt get back up. I‚Äôm not actively suicidal because I couldn‚Äôt do that to my family but it doesn‚Äôt change how I feel. 
Not sure if there are others with mental health issues who are on here that are dealing with the same feelings and issues with getting help. I hope you aren‚Äôt as alone as me tonight. Best wishes to you all.",3

2021-12-11 22:05:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/refkm9/the_hardest_part/,The Hardest Part‚Ä¶,"The hardest part is leaving behind all the homies. I am 30 days into being booze and blow free. Finally, me and my partner decided enough was enough and we attacked both of our addictions together and without any compromises that cause us to slip back into old habits (having specific days where we can party etc.). We both agree that this time feels much different than times in the past where we have tried to get clean. The biggest thing that I can say that is different for me, is that this time I didn‚Äôt focus on the fact that I would not be able to drink and do blow anymore, but I focused and prepared myself for the fact that I won‚Äôt be able to see all the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù that I know and love. I literally went from being able to pop into any bar or walk in the downtown area of my home town and find something to get into to not having anyone at all to hang out with. So I sit here on a Saturday night with the cat since the lady is out and while I have no urges to drink or snort shit up my nose, I just want all the homies to know I miss them soo much, but I just can‚Äôt be around right now. I love them to death and these people gave me a home when I felt like I did not fit in anywhere else, but I can‚Äôt keep watching people I know, love and in some cases look up to continue to destroy themselves with the life of the casual party and casual drug use. IT CATCHES UP TO YOU no matter what you think. Hope others are out there staying strong tonight. If you end up slipping up, don‚Äôt worry. You always get to try again tomorrow. You spent a long time developing these bad habits, it takes time to work them out of your system as well. 

‚ÄúRemember your plan. Remember your progress. Remember to rest.‚Äù

2021-12-11 22:02:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/refirr/my_stim_use_this_year_is_probably_dangerous_and_i/,My stim use this year is probably dangerous and I can‚Äôt see an end in sight‚Ä¶not sure what I‚Äôm looking for but needed to vent,"I‚Äôve had a fun little relapse of my eating disorder this year which has resulted in a lot of stimulant abuse.

I started the year by blowing through the approx. 5 months worth of extra 70/60mg vyvanse I had saved up in about 2.5 month (I was prescribed two pills a day and skipped the second dose a couple months in a row) and at my peak I‚Äôd taken 6 of the 70mg pills in one day. Then early to late March I ran out. Obviously the regular vyvanse dose didn‚Äôt work anymore.

In April I had my psych switch me to Mydayis (16 hour Adderall) and was given 50mg twice a day. When I had sleeping issues he wrote me a ‚Äútrial script‚Äù for two 37.5 mg pills a day, while still giving me my normal 100mg a day script if that didn‚Äôt work out. Of course I didn‚Äôt bother trying, had the thing filled and spent a couple glorious months eating thru these 60 bonus pills.

Since running out I have convinced my psych to prescribe me 125 mg of Mydayis a day. But I‚Äôd taken more than that in recent months. I‚Äôd just abused the medication enough to where my regular functional dosage had to be bumped up to something closer to my abuse dose. I still occasionally take extra alongside it. 

Alongside this‚ÄîI had been taking modafinil regularly for several months of this, usually just one pill or a half one (although earlier this year it was multiple pills sometimes mixed with Armodafinil). Ran out of those a month or two ago and haven‚Äôt bothered trying to get more since.

I added Bronkaid back into the mix in March. Their new formulation is now only 25mg ephedrine and nothing else. This being the easiest to get it has been a heavily stable part of my daily stimulant regiment up until about a week or so ago when I finally gave it a break after 8 months straight with no real breaks. I‚Äôd take up to like 10-12 of those suckers a day usually. 

In May or so albuterol entered the picture. Yes the medicine used in inhalers but in tablet form. People use it to lose weight. I didn‚Äôt take it for a couple months in the middle but as of the last month or two it is back. 4mg tablets, would take up to maybe 8-10 of those a day, still take ballpark around that.

I‚Äôve tried benzedrex a couple times, twice on the same days as my mydayis, albuterol, and ephedrine. It was great the first time but the second time it hit way too hard and made for an unpleasant day so I don‚Äôt use it as much. 

Finally I‚Äôve had a bottle of yohimbine extract since March but rarely use it because it causes me to get intense anxiety, my jaw gets all clenched, and I get really snappy and irritable. But sometimes it enters the mix.

So for a majority of the months since May I‚Äôve taken extremely high doses of Mydayis, ephedrine, and albuterol multiple times in the same day‚Äîusually 7x a week‚Äîand for a while modafinil was in the mix, and some times yohimbine gets added to that mix. There‚Äôs been at least one day where I‚Äôve taken all of those stims in the same day, or for sure all of them together except for modafinil.

I know this is all weaker stuff but this is where worrying about my weight because some fucking POS called me fat in the past has gotten me. I go to the gym excessively. 6 times a week, sometimes 7. Usually for 2-3 hours. Mix of weights and cardio. I fear trying to go to the gym without stims.

This is the second time in my life I‚Äôve had major stimulant abuse issues. The first time was also eating disorder related and when I started the ADHD medication that time I took enough of it to lose 40lbs over around 4 or 5 months. This time I did a bunch of shit to get extra meds from my doctors and friends and there was a period where I would take high doses of vyvanse alongside Mydayis, Dexedrine, and Adderall all in the same day‚Äîalongside 1000s of mgs of caffeine (xenadrine tablets) and extremely high doses of ephedrine. I stopped this habit for about a little over a year and then at the beginning of this year in January it started all over again.

I really want to try 2FMA since it‚Äôs so hard to find extra ADHD meds for me now but that‚Äôs proving just as hard to find.

I hit my lowest weight of my life over the summer.

Anyway idk why I‚Äôm sharing this. Just felt compelled to.

You guys think I‚Äôm only a few steps away from needing rehab yet? Not worried about heart attacks or anything. I assume would‚Äôve happened by now with the amount of stims constantly being pumped into my body.",4

We dated in high school for a few years and I am now 23f and he is 22. I am about to graduate collage next week and am going to grad school immediately. He still lives at home and does Ubereats and DoorDash as his job.

He has been to rehab several times and has had bouts of staying clean and then relapsing. (Anything from ketamine to Xanax to heroin to meth). A little over a month ago he rolled his car while on Xanax and could‚Äôve killer himself or someone else. He at the time relized the severity of the situation and has since talked about how immature doing drugs is. That is, until, I found out that he had relapsed and begun taking meth. This of course always hurts to hear. I confronted him and he basically said relapses happen and that‚Äôs just the way this goes.


I‚Äôve been lately trying to push him away and limit contact more and more. We are just in such different places but we have been friends for so long and I‚Äôm really the only friend who has stuck with him all these years, though I don‚Äôt see him that much and live about 45 min away. I have my own life and own friends. 

He does use drugs due to being sexually abused as a child and struggles with mental health disorders as well. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to cut contact completely but at the same time I feel guilty and it feels wrong to. I will be moving to another country in January so that will give even more space. I‚Äôve just been friends with him since I was 16. Any advice helps.
Now, I am not a saint I do party drugs occasionally but have my life together for the most part and do sometimes feel I have a problem with binge drinking. But, I am not addicted to drugs and feel like I am not being hypocritical

My (M16) closest friend (M15) has been having a rough time mentally. His childhood was never the best and he has been in therapy for as long as i have known him.

Recently he has been telling me that he started using weed to cope with some of the pain that he has been experiencing recently. I have told him that as long as he promises me that he wouldn't overuse it and that he would be careful with it that it's fine and that a lot of people do the same.

He reassured me that he would never get carried away and that it's just gonna be for a while until he gets back on his feet. I believed him of course and we went on.
However, I noticed that he would start doing it more and more, and that he would text me when he got high out of his mind.

I told him that it looks like its getting serious and that he should probably cut it out for a bit but he once again reassured me that it's alright.

I believed him. He went to therapy still, he got new meds, I thought that it would get better.

It was stupid of me really, I know, I should have done more. I of all people should have known the waring signs. I have lost people in my life to 'light drugs' and alcohol. I should have known better.

He still goes to therapy however but he stopped taking his meds, saying that weed works better. He said that I should be happy for him that anything works since he has wanted to just off himself for so long until now.

And that made me feel so bad, I felt like the worst friend in the world because of that.

This Sunday i was texting him. I was so excited to share with him that a series I was watching is getting a new season soon. And he ignored my message, I thought that he was busy so i left it for a while. He texted me back about three hours later celebrating that he found weed. He didn't agnolage what I told him about my series or anything. He was just happy about the weed.

And that worried me. I got so scared because that was an immediate red flag with something like that. Or at least it has been for me in the past.

So I told him. I told him that I cared about him so much, I told him that it looks like it has become a problem, I told him that no matter what I will always be there for him, I told him that I have lost people to weed before and that I was so worried for him because I didn't want to lose him.

I want him to be happy, I want him to live a long life. I don't think that I'm being selfish by saying that.

He told me tho, that he didn't ask for my opinion. He told me that I should be happy for him, and that there is no reason for me to be worried. He told me that he doesn't get why I am acting so dramatically because its just weed and that if he wanted to die he would have used harder drugs.

I cried for the rest of the night. I tried to talk to him again after that but he was high at that point. And the next time, and the next.

It's been a week since I have been aware of this and I don't have anyone to turn to.

I don't have a therapist like he does. I don't have supportive parents, so I can't talk to them about this. We don't go to the same school, so I can't talk to the counselor. I don't know who his therapist is so I can't Email them.

So please, I know that it might be selfish of me to beg for help, but please, help me get to him somehow. Please help me in deciding what to do.

I don't even know if this is the correct subreddit to post this to but I will take anything, please. I don't want to lose another good friend.

I know that I am supposed to be strong and that I should always be there for my friends to lean on but recently I can't find it in me to be strong.

I can't do anything but cry and worry.

Please, help me.",0

I lost faith in religion years ago and everywhere I look humanity is treating the planet like  Johny Knoxville treats a rental car.  I get up every morning and take a handful of supplements hoping that I can resist the urge to buy some weed carts on the way to a job I hate. But, I don't even want another job cause it's just going to have the same problem of wasting my time. Like why in the world would we spend half our waking existence at work when we're not even sure there's anything after this? Why wouldn't we try to maximize every second with joy and bliss? It's just moronic that a handful of people have convinced us this is the way to live. And I see no way out. Everyday I do physical labor knowing if i hurt myself I can't pay the bill. It's like playing a game of monopoly when you have like $500 and your next turn has the strong possibility of landing on a property you can't afford the rent on. Speaking of rent why the fuck is it so expensive everywhere? Just seeing the numbers makes me want to give up. After the last 4 years with Trump I've just kinda giving up. How does a society chose someone who can't speak in coherent sentences to lead us into the future? Everyday I'm bombarded by stupidity like a space ship flying through the asteroid belt. Any form of happiness in this world seems like it would require a bit of delusion. As far as I can see humanity is just kinda driving head first towards it's own destruction and nobody seems to give a fuck or do anything about it. And I'm just one person in the sea of humanity what am I supposed to do? I just try to keep my head down enjoy myself as much as possible and leave no children behind. So I do drugs but, at least try to stick to the ones that don't kill me like weed and kratom. At the same time I don't really think this path leads anywhere good. I was literally thinking to myself ""am i really gonna get a flat tire on a pot hole or in a car accident in a snowstorm for some fucking kratom? It isn't that good turn around and go home.""  Then I got to the store and someone was asking for money cause they were just stranded (really poor area). I could have given him a ride to the train station or something but, wasn't sure I wouldn't get killed for trying to be nice. So I gave him my change from the kratom store and my transit card with $5 on it and wished him luck. But, these stories aren't even atypical. I could have been robbed or worse just for some kratom. But, you know what? Stories like these are why I choose to use drugs even though I know I might be better off without them. Anyway TLDR I know drugs probably don't end well but, do them anyway cause the world is on fire anyway",25

2021-12-11 11:42:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/re3iko/i_am_addicted_to_scratching/,I am addicted to scratching,"As an eczema prone person, I have occasional flare-ups. The thing is, aside from environmental factors like the weather, these flare-ups are mostly caused by me. Let's say there's a dry area on my skin, which usually happens on my hands or forearms, near the inside of my elbow, I'll scratch that area because it itches. However, this only makes it worse, and the itch gets worse, causing me to scratch more until a rash develops. 

&#x200B;

A rash is truly a different scratching experience, one that goes beyond the simple satisfaction of relief, it becomes pleasure. When you scratch an itch, you disrupt the signals your brain creates by instead sending in pain signals. When these pain signals are sent, pain-relieving chemicals are also released in the brain, which is why scratching an itch feels good. Therefore, the stronger the itch, the more pain is needed to disrupt it, releasing more pain-fighting chemicals and making the sensation more pleasant. 

&#x200B;

The pain-relieving chemicals are endorphins, which work by binding to opioid receptors, which are the receptors that inhibit the communication of pain signals. However, the difference between endorphins and opioids is that the former are much weaker because the strength of their bonds to receptors is weaker. Nevertheless, this means that endorphins and opioids produce very similar effects, including euphoria. This feeling is the reason opioids are addictive and why endorphins are too. Think about how people get addicted to running, playing sports or going to the gym, it's in part because of the endorphins. 

&#x200B;

Personally, I'm addicted to scratching, and going back to what I was saying earlier, the more pain, the more pleasure (which might also explain the BDSM stuff some people enjoy), which is why my go-to fix is scalding water. The warm and pleasant sensation it creates is like no other, it starts at my hands, radiates up my arms, reaches my head and goes down my legs, almost making them waver. My mind becomes completely blank and I become fully absorbed in the sensation until it loses its intensity, which is enough to give my eyes a slight red tint.

&#x200B;

Just a week ago, my skin was barely inflamed anymore until I relapsed a few days ago. Relapsing is so easy, all it takes is one moment of weakness to decide to give in. After that, you want to give in because of how enticing it is and because you're not only relieving an itch...",4

2021-12-11 00:11:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rdsatw/im_grasping_at_straws_here_i_need_help/,i‚Äôm grasping at straws here.. i need help,"hello, i don‚Äôt really know to even start this, but i desperately need advice. i by no means, want to come off as insensitive.. please know that i am someone who loves someone struggling with addiction and i am desperate here.

so, i‚Äôll start with some background. i am 28f, living across the country from my family (3000+ miles) and the past few visits i have been home, i stared addiction right in the eyes as i watched it take over my 25f baby sister. the problem is, she despises me.. and i mean, truly hates me with ever fiber in her being, which has built from a lifeline history of jealousy, paired most recently with her addiction, and i don‚Äôt know how to help her. 

she has struggled with addiction, presenting itself in many different ways, since she was 15. first pills, then alcohol, then pills again‚Ä¶ she was clean for about 2 years when she was pregnant with her daughter, but quickly got back into her party phase and now she‚Äôs upgraded to ‚Äúthe heavy stuff‚Äù. she‚Äôs never gone into formal treatment, the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù has always been remove her from the situation, rather than remove the situation from her life (if that makes sense). for example, after my parents found out about the pills, she blames her group of friends and my family moved a few states away. among her addiction, she struggles with menta health (depression, anxiety, anger management issues) and has for as long as i can remember. 

she‚Äôs a highschool drop out, who got pregnant with her daughter way too young, so she still lives at home with my parents. i‚Äôm not judging this, i supported it for a long time because i wanted her to have the extra help and a shot at a decent future for her and my niece, as that was the plan. but it‚Äôs been four years, and as far as i can tell the situation is only enabling her to go deeper down the path she‚Äôs on. she has basically manipulated my parents into being full time, on call childcare and very little about her life has had to change since becoming a mom. she had also made minimal effort to start planning for her future, and in four years just recently obtained her GED. 

the thing is, it‚Äôs not a big secret that she has been using. she‚Äôs been transparent about it, oddly. she has however, managed to play it off as a ‚Äúone time thing‚Äù on many occasions. 

anyways, in more recent times (the last 6-8 months) my parents have dropped a few bombs on me which initially started my suspicions. first one being that she has been stealing money‚Ä¶ i was visiting home a few months back and left my wallet out on the kitchen table. i couldn‚Äôt find it when i was leaving, and my dad informed me that he put it in a safe, where he and my mom have been keeping theirs, because money keeps disappearing. 
the next one was that she has recently reconnected with a ghost from her past, a family friend who has been in and out of treatment centers for the last 5 years, and who undeniably is still using (obviously worrisome), but under the guise that my sister is helping her stay sober, and since finding this information out i‚Äôve noticed they are attached at the hip, together 24/7. sometimes, she even brings my niece with her when they hangout. i feel for this girl, i want her to get help and i wanted to believe she was and that maybe my sister was genuinely helping her, until she personally asked me for drugs (i don‚Äôt know why even still, maybe a cry for help.. because i don‚Äôt even know where to look let alone find drugs). i informed my parents, who were able to mitigate and reach out to her family to get her some help, which she refused and denied the whole situation. anyways, obviously the two of them together is somthing to worry about. anyways, the last and final bomb that was revealed was that she was involved in a situation where a person she was with, was arrested for possession with intent to distribute while she was giving them a ride. she somehow got out of any legal trouble, but this kind of solidified my suspicion. that, and the visible physical changes i have noticed with her in between visits and photos over the last year. 

on top of all this, her behavior has been absolutely all over the place. she is fine one moment, happy even, laughing and joking around. then the next, the smallest thing will set her off and she‚Äôs like a hurricane.. destructive, violent, and unable to calm down. the correlation however, is that most of these ‚Äúgood happy moods‚Äù happen directly after she comes home from being with her friend, and the erratic, scary, violent moods happen the day afterwards and last for hours, sometimes days. they always start uber the smallest things, like the last one started becuase i knocked on the door.. but during them she jumps all over the place and finds about 10 other reasons why she‚Äôs mad. almost like she forgets what set her off in the first place. it‚Äôs gotten to the point where she has put her hands on my mother on multiple occasions, damaged property (like denting a $4000 refrigerator, holes in the walls, broken cell phones, broken toys). she gets horrifically nasty with her words too, and will say just about anything to hurt you. she gaslights and is manipulative during these fits too, she will twist the situation and blame everyone but herself even though she is the one and only person putting up a fight. she threatens to harm/kill whoever is getting the wrath, she threatens to take her daughter away from all of us.. i witnessed one of these violent fits the last time i was visiting, and truthfully i am scared. it was terrifying. my mom and i had to just sit there and take the abuse, in an effort to not get her even more worked up. the worst part, is that she does all of this right in front of her daughter. 

all of this is taking a huge toll on everyone, but specifically my mom. she gets the blunt end, the physically violent outbursts, the nasty things my sister says to her. she has to be the one to comfort her daughter when it‚Äôs finally over. 

my parents are in deep deep denial regarding her drug use. they know she has ‚Äúmessed with‚Äù opioids, among other things, but don‚Äôt connect these instances with the behavior that i see. they chalk it up as her mental health issues, as she has had a long history with those struggles as well. they enable her, and have for a long time, and now i am worrisome that it‚Äôs too late.

i have been worried sick since i left after my last visit. i‚Äôm worried for my sister obviously, i want her to get help, i want her to get through this. but more so, i am so scared that if i can‚Äôt help my family see what i see‚Ä¶ one of them is going to get seriously, physically, injured. i am worried about their peace‚Ä¶ they have to hide valuables and money, in their own home, and worry about property damage everytime my sister is in a bad mood. even more, i‚Äôm worried that my neice is going to lose her mom or sustain serious trauma from all of this. i‚Äôm across the country, i can‚Äôt be there to help in the ways i would like to.. how can i see it from this far away and a few visits back home, and they can‚Äôt see it stating them right in the face? ultimately, the only thing that will fix this situation is either my sister getting the help she needs‚Ä¶ getting cleaned getting real treatment, or her giving up custody of her daughter to my parents and moving out. 

i guess what i am asking, from other people who have either suffered with addiction or have a love one who is an addict‚Ä¶ how long did it take for your parents or loved ones to realize? do you wish someone would have told them sooner? 

what are the biggest differences between addiction behaviors vs mental health behaviors? am i onto somthing, or could i be wrong and it could very well just be a side affect of her depression/anxiety/anger management? 

i know that hanging out with other addicts doesn‚Äôt always mean that they are addicts themselves, but am i right to be worried? especially when said addict declined help after trying to relapse? 

how am i supposed to protect my family without hurting her? how can i help her too? 

i‚Äôm lost here. i am so very lost. i just can‚Äôt sit here and watch my parents, sister, AND neice suffer. is it imorak or wrong to try and eliminate some of the suffering at the expense of someone who is sick? it feels wrong, but what if it‚Äôs my only option? 

thank you to anyone who can help me with this. i am praying for all of you who have recognized your addictions and reached out for help, or those of you who are watching addiction take someone you love.",9

Its hard for me to feel good without doing drugs. My last medication for epilepsy (gabapentin) i abused. I took 7g in one day, 70 100mg pills. Snorted it, smoked it, ate it. I have a drug problem.

Im unemployed, i live with my parents. I can barely conjure the motivation to clean my room or take a shower.

I recently bought cbn, because i use cbd regularly and wanted to try something else.

I tried the cbn. It makes me feel so much better. Super chilled out and happy. But i was addicted to weed before and it destroyed me. Theres a huge stigma around weed addiction so i hope i dont trigger anyone into hating on me for that.

I smoked weed every day for over 3 years (im 23) and it left me with no appetite, chronic diahrea (for over a year) 140 lbs 6'6"" tall, and too anxious to leave the house let alone see friends.

This cbn is reminding me of weed. (Its a cannabinoid). Im thinking i can switch it out for my hydroxyzine that i take every night to fall asleep. Hydroxyzine makes me a bit dumber/more fatigued the day after taking it.

Am i crazy to feel like cbn is going to be like weed? I used to be way smarter before the epilepsy drugs. A tiny bit of weed makes me mega dumb. It doesnt take much for me to have a hard time thinking/speaking coherently. Im afraid i could become dependant on cbn and have it start to slow my brain too much.

Ive been going to therapy for 6 months. I cant stop smoking cigarettes and i need my pills to function. Is my life just going to be endless cravings for drugs to let me feel happy and ok? Please say no. Please say it gets better. Please. Thank you.",3

    Back to the question, she's never smoked, never drank, never touched anything. When she found out and months after we were apart she still thinks it's a choice, that at one point down the line I did the drug. I didn't say no. Partly correct I said, at first for fun, then to escape, then I fed the beast chasing something I'd never get again yet I couldn't help it.

   That I'm hurting myself, hurting people around me, expressing how I basically threw caution to the wind. I honestly don't think she will ever understand, which I have come to realize and accept. Sucks, because I don't want a broken family, but if rather not have my kids see me going in and out of there life and possibly get them taken.

2021-12-09 22:34:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/rcz4h3/i_am_more_than_my_addiction/,I am more than my addiction.,"I'm finally sober. Not just x-amount of days clean, but finally mentally prepared to stay clean. So much clarity has come back to me these past few days that I completely forgot could exist. For so long while using, I was using to feel ""normal"" again, avoiding being sick at all costs. Not having more than a 3-second rush since in over a year. But I guess somewhere along the way I forgot what normal truly was. Hell, substance abuse has only been an issue for like 3 years, and heroin specifically for about 20 months, but I've dealt with depression and other looming mental health issues for years and years and years now - so after getting through the week of physical withdrawals, and then some specific events happening - I feel ""normal"" in a brand new way. I feel great!

Before I get into those specificities, I want to talk about what got me here. So, I've tried to quit time and time again, but each time, I wasn't even really trying. I just told myself in a single moment that I was going to try, but I didn't actually want to quit. And then every time, as I would get more dope sick, I would immediately cave in. It didn't matter how many times I got arrested, nor how many times I hurt somebody or hurt myself - for these past 20 months, since I met Her for the first time, the only thing I have given a single fuck about is getting my fix. And as it goes, the further I went down that road, the more and more I was willing to give up everything else I had and lose all of the care I had for everything and everyone around me. Because I had no will anymore. It was Hers. However, on the first of this month some shit went down and I ended up in a situation where I was forced to go through the whole week of withdrawals. I didn't really have much to get through it so I used a combination of dxm, dph, and a couple clonidine and buprenorphine I had to get me through the week. It didn't help much, but it was something else to focus away from the pain. However, I was still shooting up the dph and the bup, so I was still caving into the needle fetish. So I got to the end of the week and the physical withdrawals were gone for the most part, at least the ones that were torturing me. But, despite the physical dependency disappearing, the mental dependency was still very much present. I had been trying most of the week to get anyone I could to help me get some shit, but all the users I know don't give a fuck about me unless I can help them get dope themselves, so that of course didn't happen. (Which I am now grateful for, but it was driving me insane as it was going down.)

so yeah, I got through the initial withdrawals but still wanted to score. And scoring is just what I did. And then the needle went in. The rush was better than usual given that my tolerance shifted down a bit after the last week. and it felt really good. It really did. However, something kind of strange was different this time around. I didn't really feel satisfied. it didn't fulfill the desire that had always motivated me to shoot up any other time. The same desire which I had thought led me to that very moment. So I had another shot left over, waited a little while, and went for it again. And again, the rush was there. And I loved it. But I didn't feel truly satiated by it. it's like the hunger wasn't even there, I just wanted something. Then I went to bed, and the next day, the cravings were COMPLETELY gone! For the first time ever, I shot up heroin and woke up NOT wanting more heroin!! Any other day I would have laid in bed for hours and hours depressed and waiting until I had an opportunity to do something to score. But instead, I was able to get out of bed upon first waking up and get through the day motivated and productive. which is something that a totally normal person would do, but considering how it's been all this time - it was fucking crazy! I knew the physical withdrawals weren't going to be a thing since I had gone through the withdrawal process and didn't use enough times to trigger them again, but the mental dependency? It was there just the day before.. I was craving the whole time I was withdrawing. I even told myself that I was going to try to continue using here and there, but to do so periodically to avoid experiencing withdrawals again. (Ya know, like we all tell ourselves we can do. Lol.) But I'm so fucking grateful that none of that happened and I woke up feeling okay with nothing, because had it gone any other way - I wouldn't be writing this. And now, I'm going into day 3 sober.

And I'm also kinda happy I had that last shot. Because, all my life, anytime anything has ever hurt me or fed into my depression, I've never been able to get closure. whether it was a failed relationship or loss or some traumatic event I have been through - I have never once in my life gotten closure from any of it. It all just came to an abrupt ending and tore me apart. Fucked me up. Led me to that point where I sought out heroin to fill the void and thus begun this horrific, seemingly endless cycle. The moral slip. Loss of self. Sold my soul. But this time, having those last shots and being lucky enough to not even be satisfied with them despite feeling the exact same incredible euphoric rush that I had been chasing every single fucking day for over 600 days in a row.. it was like I got to say goodbye. I finally got closure in a sense. So maybe that's why I feel okay. Maybe.

And, perhaps it's because I've dealt with severe mental health issues for most of my life, but the post-withdrawal depression and typical lack of motivation and energy isn't even a thing for me. I feel more motivated than ever, and I've been incredibly productive the past couple days. The insomnia is a serious problem, but even with getting very little sleep, I'm able to get out of bed feeling energized and honestly perfectly fine. Whereas for all these months, I would get 12 hours of sleep and wake up feeling like I couldn't even get out of bed for hours, even if I knew I could go get dope. That's how bad it was, so sick that I wasn't motivated enough to score until I was even sicker and painfully desperate. So this has been a full 180¬∞ for me mentally. 

I truly feel mentally sober.

Now, I acknowledge the fact that I am still a drug addict. I have serious addiction issues, that's been a problem for my whole entire life, the substance abuse being only in recent years. Same goes for knowing that I still have these mental health issues. However, I'm taking advantage of the fact that I feel great. and I'm running with it. and I'm not going to fucking stop until god smites me into ash. 

I'm still a huge advocate for all drugs in safe, responsible settings where harm reduction is taken in as a factor, and the user isn't someone like me who is going to throw themselves into the wrath of addiction; but for now, I'm going to stay sober. because I want to. I really want to. 

if anyone wants to know anything at all, I'm happy to talk. I really want to talk honestly, hence why I'm even posting this. maybe I can offer some advice? or if you just need to talk, I'm here to listen. please don't hesitate :) thanks for reading.

EDIT: Also, the night I had those last shots, my dealer actually gave me a number and was telling me about a job he had for me that was going to be a really good, easy score. So thank FUCK for this turn of events, because following through with that either could have ended me up in jail for violating probation, or probably fucking overdosing for excitedly taking too big a shot so soon. I'm grateful for this.",12

We exchanged our freedoms for this drug. We were willing. Until we weren't willing anymore though sadly it's too late for him. My dear friend, I took to him no less than a brother. I loved him and still do.

I was with him on a bender for 4 days the beginning of December. I could have been there. The law is so unforgiving. I didn't go to jail with him. I should be grateful at the least for this reminder. But why do I feel guilty?

His son's mother broke the news to me. Jails, institutions, death - that's what I thought after seeing the headline of a successful high profile police operation. Thank goodness it wasn't death. Nonetheless I was stunned as she gave few details she had and asked my opinion, and asked what did I think about: ""BAIL?"" No. ""How long?"" Long. I couldn't even give her comfort.

My friend's wife was begging me to help her make sense of things, begging for comfort. I couldn't make sense of things myself. Why do I feel I'm being given another chance, after being given so many before? Was he given more chances than I was to turn our lives around, and turned them down?

My dad has been a drug addict most my life and I never really noticed it until when I was around 13. I'm 21 now and his caregiver cause he's 70 years old and needs help with everyday tasks. 

It's just gotten to a point where he gets high every single day of the week and it seems like he's always high. Half the time he doesn't even know what's going on or he hallucinates. It's very tiring and mentally/emotionally draining see this everyday. He refuses to admit that he has a problem and just blames it on other stuff but I know he gets high. 

I'm just at a point where as much as I love him I can't make his addiction mine and I need to move on. I've dealt with this shit for too long and it's not fair to me to have to essentially babysit my father and wait for the inevitable overdose that will take him out. 

I guess my main reason behind this rant is that I was curious if I am selfish for giving up on him. He's obviously shown he doesn't want to even try to get clean so why should I have to throw away my life on the off chance of him actually doing something about his addiction. 

It's just a fucked situation all around and I just am lost as to what to do anymore. Anyway thank you for your time and for listening to what I have to say and I hope you all have a great day",1

We met at a time I was in active addiction, and we instantly became best friends. My drug Xanax hers meth. I met her right after I lost my dad, out of everyone she never judged me when I was at my worst and my worst was pretty bad. Well eventually I got clean and practically turned my whole life around and while she used to do meth here and there she got hooked on it all of a sudden. Her and her BF became completely different people to the point I had to call cps on her to protect her kids from them. He was violent and so many other horrible things the kids had to endure. 

Through it all I stayed by her side and tried to help her as much as I could. She wanted to be clean, I could see it and she would always try but get pulled back down. She lived with me twice, I took her to rehab multiple times just for her to leave. Kept getting pregnant, beaten, kept going back to dude. This went on for 3 years. I had to distance myself but she would always reach out and I‚Äôd be there. I couldn‚Äôt give up on her.

Finally she seems like she‚Äôs in a good place, has her kids and we‚Äôre getting to rekindle our real friendship that got lost in the madness. She looks up to me and I‚Äôm super proud of her.

Reflecting on night 37.,"Another night plagued by nightmares, the afraid to go back to sleep kind, the drink an ice cold glass of water and turn on the lamp for a minute kind. But it‚Äôs said that God punishes us for the things we can‚Äôt imagine, which is good because I imagine the worst on a nightly basis. Still, that medium Coke from Arby‚Äôs right before bed time probably had a lot do with it. My rudimentary understanding of the brain says that decision drove the nightmares, that my obsessive dives into Stephen King novels created the landscape, and last night the monster from IT was alive and well in my psyche. Not the clown. Instead the entity that manifests as the things we fear most. 

But by morning I was dreaming about driving down winding California highways, something I can imagine quite well because I‚Äôve had the pleasure of doing it. Two and a half years ago I took a solo trip west without telling anyone. I often think that experience renewed my will to live, that it gave me something to strive for after quitting a good job before they had a chance to fire me, and it would be so much more poetic had I not relapsed with a vengeance when I got back home to Ohio.

That‚Äôs the one that taught me how fragile sanity truly is, the one that left me conversing full time with the voices inside in my head, and my family still doesn‚Äôt quite believe I was working on three weeks of sobriety the day I was finally hospitalized. The healing didn‚Äôt really start until someone used the term traumatic brain injury to describe what I was going through, residual psychosis, giving credence to the idea that there is something more to addiction than a lack of willpower, a chemical explanation to an abstract thought, and allowing me to see myself as the perpetrator and the victim in the war with myself. 

There is power in understanding that you have a screw loose upstairs. It makes me skeptical of my own thoughts, and maddening as it may be the constant interruption of my own toxic thoughts is something of a superpower. Identifying and eliminating the stimuli that bring on those toxic thoughts is particularly useful, hence why I‚Äôve taken a massive step back from following current events, choosing to focus on fiction, character development, and human nature rather than what Travis Scott, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden are up to. I won‚Äôt go as far as saying there is more truth in fiction than real life, but sometimes I wish that were the case. In fiction the bad guys get there‚Äôs in the end. In real life, well, in real life we find our will to live then do our best to throw it all away. We survive. And we dream of monsters.",7

I'm very scared.","Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but I'm not sure where to ask. I'm in my late 20's, never smoked weed in my life or took THC. I'm not even sure if THC is the culprit but I'm including it anyway.   
  
Here's my timeline:  
    
- Have a pack of THC gummies, each gummy is 20mg   
- For about a week I kept taking them in increments each day (2.5, 5, 10, 15 etc). Felt nothing. Thought maybe cause I'm a bigger dude (250lbs).  
- Finally took an entire gummy, bam, first time I felt high. Actually enjoyed the experience. This was on Tuesday. 
- On Friday, had the worse tension headache of my life...probably from bad posture (I sometimes lay on my stomach and use my laptop), this lasted 24 hours. All the Tylenol and Advil in the world did not help. Even used some Hydromorphone I had left from surgery, did nothing.   
- Last Saturday, tension headache was mostly or entirely gone  
- Early Sunday, had these constant fits of feeling like I was about to throw up but couldn't. Just a bunch of Nausea. Blood pressure was slightly high but that's normal for me.  
- Diet has not changed, eating well, drinking well, electrolytes are fine.
  
 
**Onto the main symptoms I'm having now**   
  
Since then, I've been feeling lightheaded/woozy. It's hard to describe but it's like I'm ""not there"". It happens whether I'm laying down or standing up, it almost feels like I'm going to faint (not to that level, but almost like a buildup). I feel like I'm laggy but real life. I don't think it's vertigo because the room is not spinning and I'm not getting blurred vision, but it definitely feels like my brain is catching up or something. It's not something that happens prolonged either, not like 30 seconds straight, but like 1-2 seconds of that feeling, it stops, then I feel it against after another minute. **The best way I can describe it** is you know that feeling where you've stayed up too late and need to go to bed, almost like you're about to hit your head on your desk but you catch yourself? It's like that. 
   
My GP told me it was probably anxiety (I don't think it is, I do get anxious for sure but I've been less anxious as of late). He told me to let him know how I feel in a week. My question is, what could this be, are there any at-home tests I should consider, and does this sound like anything you've experienced? Was it the THC?   
  
 The only reason I felt like it couldn't be was it's been 8 days, and I felt like that's way too long to still have any residual effects. I thought I would ask here before I spend a few hundred dollars and a long train ride going to a dizziness clinic in Toronto.",0

Its been awhile since Ive made a post but my first post was about my addiction to crystal meth. I said I would quit and Ive kept my word. Ive been clean since then. The withdrawel had been so difficult to get through but I think Im at a place in my life where I dont feel like I need it anymore. Ive started eating more and taking vitamins. Started drinking water regularly. I feel better mentally. Ive been hanging around new people and they genuinely make me so happy. During my addiction, I remember thinking that meth was the answer to make me happy and thats not true at all. I was really depressed at that point in my life. It got so bad that I would have panic attacks and existential crisis'. I felt like I was so unhappy with where life had lead me and how much I hated myself for letting that happen. I still have other habits to work on but I have been sober for quite awhile except when I drank a little on thanksgiving. Other than that, my life has been pretty sober. Thank you all out there who have looked after me even if we dont personally know each other. I really appreciate that. I felt like I was drowning constantly every single day but you guys helped me out of such a dark depressing part of my life and I couldnt thank you enough. Im getting a bit emotional but I truly am greatful. I hope others out there get better. It does get better even if you think youre also drowning on the daily. Stay strong everyone.",31

A year ago i read a book titled *the body keeps the score* where the author explains how trauma impacts the brain--chemically, even physically and subsequently remains patterns that form the brains functioning, what kind of therapies are there and how the results of different studies affected the state of the art medical therapy for patients of trauma. it opened my eyes to this human condition and experience. and to keep it short: it was an amazing book.

now i am looking for a similar book on the subject of *addiction (substances, pornography, etc)*. i want to understand how it affects the brain and body and why it is so difficult to fight against and recover from. something scientific but also easy to comprehend for people who dont have a medical-studies background. podcasts are also fine. i prefer series and formats that dont end after 45 min, like documentaries do. 

please no guide books.

While we were together I never noticed any signs that he was using. He‚Äôs very good looking and always kept up with his appearance and he never looked like he was on drugs. When I found out was one day I was hugging him and reached my hands in his pockets and felt a meth pipe. By that time I had just found out i was pregnant. I tried helping him but he didn‚Äôt ever admit that he was using or needed help. We had a huge falling out and we broke up when my son was a couple weeks old. My son is turning 1 next week and I hadn‚Äôt heard from him until yesterday. 
According to my ex‚Äôs dad he has been living outside of his home under a bridge in complete filth, his dad told me he had finally said he wanted to go to rehab. I went to see him to take him and I said how he was living on the floor and how it was inhumane the way he was living. I took him to a rehab where he‚Äôll be for 4 months and so far he looked very willing and even admitted to needing help. We haven‚Äôt been together since my son was a newborn and I just can‚Äôt help but have mixed emotions. On one hand I‚Äôm extremely happy because I have never loved anyone like I have loved him, after all he gave me my greatest blessing. I think if it weren‚Äôt for his addiction, we could‚Äôve had a strong relationship and family. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up because he is good at manipulating others to get what he wants. 
He‚Äôs been using crystal meth since he was around 17 yrs old and he‚Äôs now 25. He‚Äôs always been a caring and loving person, but with meth he turns into a completely different person. I‚Äôm willing to be his support system just one last time, I just want the person I once loved to come back, then maybe he can become a part of our child‚Äôs life.

Until Recently I was obsessed with fanfiction. Like, *obsessed*. It helped me get through tough times too. And so far, when I've had tough times, I think that if \[my fav fictional character at that time\] could handle so much trauma and pressure, me, a normal person with no issues/trauma can definitely get thru this thing. But the issue is, as I got older, this method stopped working. 

When I force myself to stop reading, it works for a week. Then I relapse even harder.

I spend 90% of my time on reading. I also have clinical depression and I can't find myself getting other hobbies even if I am interested in stuff.

I stopped getting my happiness from fanfiction, but I cannot stop reading. In fact, I'm reading even more, to experience that happiness again. I know I'm wasting my time *but I can't stop*.

Is this an addiction? What do I do to stop it? (I know it's not such a health degrading addiction but I still think that it's ruining me.)",4

I don‚Äôt really know where to start so maybe some background. I‚Äôve known this person since we were in grade 6 (in the back half of our 30‚Äôs now) & we‚Äôve generally run in the same circle of friends.

We hung out here and there during high school but mostly just partied together. In their mid/late 20‚Äôs their mother got terminally sick & passed away. This was the kicking off point of their free fall into problems. Cocaine & booze, as far as I know, being the numbing agents of choice.  They went through a pretty rough time at which I didn‚Äôt really have any contact as I was busying raising my children & building a life with my wife. I stayed home a lot during that period. 

For the past 5-8 years we‚Äôve playing playing sports together on a rec team I run. They have had multiple instances of explosive anger episodes directed at opponents, officials or even teammates. Like a switch would go off & they had lost all control. So they left the team for awhile until this year when they had gotten some things in their life ‚Äútogether‚Äù. 

Together is used lightly here as in reality they‚Äôd split from a long term partner in which they have a child together, left their job & pursued a new career by starting over in fire & rescue. The relationship, from what I understand, was volatile from both sides & needed to end. But they got served some papers from a lawyer in the past month, not sure exactly why about but I assume it‚Äôs custody. 

They had been working really hard to kick the drugs & booze as they recognize it‚Äôs a main source of a lot of their problems. This new career was helping big time.But the schooling ended recently & now their back in their home & city with no school or job to keep them preoccupied. They‚Äôve fallen off the wagon & started drinking again. 

I exchanged some texts a week or two ago while they we‚Äôre going through withdrawals. I offered to bring some food/drink & extended an open offer for help @ anytime. 

They showed up drunk(I didn‚Äôt know) to the sport again on the weekend & exploded on an opponent, got kicked out & sprayed water at an official. They quit the team & left their jerseys behind. I got a short text saying everyday life is beating them down & they need to step away.

Well about an hour ago they called me in tears, apologizing for the other night. They said they‚Äôve been in bed ever since & just pulled themselves out today. We chatted for a bit about things that went down. I know they‚Äôre trying but they‚Äôre at the mercy of their addiction. They admitted they were drinking right now but have stayed off the drugs all along. Right before the end of our conversation they said it would mean a lot to them if I came and hung this week. 

I‚Äôm a child of a parent who took their own life after years of addiction. I‚Äôve seen it first hand although I was under 10 when it all happened. So I know very well how serious it is & can get. 

I want to help & support this person as their is a child involved that really needs them. Which is why I‚Äôm here asking for some advice on how to handle this. I already text them to say I‚Äôm coming over tomorrow evening & will be bringing their favorite food. 
But what do I do once I arrive? I don‚Äôt want to overstep any boundaries. 
What do they need once I leave?

Any & all help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",3

I was binging for 6 days before work, after work, during work, in the bathroom while my family was in the living room etc. Last time I did this was in September and I would go the gym and also do it there. This time I didn‚Äôt have the motivation to go to the gym. Yeah so I was feeling paranoid that anyone would find out and I smoke weed everyday so this doesn‚Äôt also help. I have great friends, a great family, great job, great opportunities, will get my University degree soon... it was so weird throwing it all away. It was a lot of coke but I had read here in /addiction someone saying to just flush it cause it‚Äôs already bad spent money and I thought about it and just did it. My body and mind were like please don‚Äôt throw all this beautiful snow away we need it. But I knew I was stronger than it. To fool myself I just thought ‚Äúimagine you lost this at a party or you shared it with some friends‚Äù. Yeah so there was a great feeling of overcoming the addiction for a few hours but then I started feeling regret (the addicted kind of regret). Yeah but smoking weed and drinking some wine helped (I had done a line like one hour before I threw it away) and I just wanted to go to sleep and wake up clean. Since  the day I had bought it I hadn‚Äôt stop for more than like 3-4 hours while I was sleeping. I would do some first thing in the morning cause it just helped me feel great. I felt that I was better at work and social life and studying. This is my third time buying some and doing alone at home for some days straight. Today I feel like a really want to buy some more but I know that it is a stupid thought. I don‚Äôt want to be dependent of it, I want to use it to have fun some times and I always kind of did it with other drugs but coke is a different story cause you still function socially so you think it‚Äôs okay what you are doing... who wants to talk about their experience?

UPDATE: I first want to thank all of you for the comments, you have no idea how much it helped me not to buy again. Today is my second day clean and it feels great. Yesterday was a bit harder and the cravings were strong but today is okay. I really enjoy feeling like myself today and not being dominated by the drug.

Lately, I've been using again. It's not out of control yet but I feel like it will soon. I live in a clinic due to my mental health where drugs and alcohol are prohibited. My addiction is kinda fucking up my treatment at the moment, which is why I checked myself into rehab. I dont know when im actually going there yet, but it gives me quite some anxiety.

A few weeks ago, I started using. twice a day, everyday. It used to be way worse so I had an okay feeling about it. I was getting my shit done, even school was going great. I felt pretty alright too. Not too numb or overemotional. Ofcourse, I didnt have full control. I never have and I never will. But at least I had a little bit of it and that felt good.

Last week the workers and my therapist sat down with me and let me know that they're setting up new rules for me around my use. The rules aren't too bad. Every night, i get 15 minutes to go outside and light one up, and when I come back I go straight to my room. If I use earlier, I won't be allowed outside for 3 days. 1 day stands, 2 days are removeable with doing chores heh. If I'm under the influence in the clinic, go outside while the punishment (staying inside) still stands, I get a time-out.(Time out = 1 week sleeping at home, which I must avoid at all cost heh)

It may seem odd that they let me use n all, i mean, i havent seen this before in my life. But probably because I'm going to rehab soon anyways and they can't do so much about it. I'm grateful that we found a middle in this situation so it makes everyone happy hehe

I'm very thankful for these rules (they also could've kicked my ass out or worse), but still it stresses me out so much. I started having the worst cravings since that conversation. I wanna feel okay doing it once everyday. I wanna feel okay following the rules. I don't want to come crying to them that ""one time isn't enough"". I'd be ungrateful and inconsiderate. They did a lot for me. I just hate how my brain works.

So, due to the stress, I also reach out to other substances. I contacted my dealer again, I'm trying my best to get to other drugs. Anything, really. Started looking online for glue to huff and whatnot. Also had my friend contact her dealer for some ketamine or 3MMC.

I feel so frustrated and my mind is flowing over.

But I have started smoking cigarettes recently - for the first time in my life. Is there a better alternative?,"The question is: is there a better alternative that can give me some buzz to feel okay? 


I had a friend's cigarette pack which I have been smoking once a day and it is a big relief. 


I know vape is not safe either, but being out of options, I am going to buy it soon for the first time ever. Posting it here to see if there is a better alternative. 


(Is there another subreddit where I should post this?)


Some notes before you answer:


- Cannabis could have been a good option but it is illegal here. (I used to smoke that, but can't anymore). 


- I have been opposed to using cigarettes and nicotine smokers for 31 years. And now, I am the one smoking to feel normal. 


- I am going through one of the toughest times of my life. I don't feel to have too many long term goals anymore. So my mind is using this reason to allow the smoke. My mind is saying, what's the worst that could happen? - You will eventually die a painful death because of smoking, right? So be it. 


- I don't think I am depressed. Sometimes the circumstances are so dire and unfortunate that... If you are in pouring rain, there's only so much you could do to save yourself from getting drenched.


- I have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy for 4 years now and it is helping me tremendously. But the situation is one of the worsts. There's only so much it could do.


- Alcohol is not doing it for me. I hate it actually. There's only so much junk food I can eat. There's only so much TV shows I can watch. These were nice short term escapes but I will need something else.



- I have a day job. But it's work from home now.


- I do have a serious hobby that I am passionate about and I work on it everyday as much as I can. But there is only so much you could do that. 


- I do have friends that I talk to over phone almost everyday and play video games with them, while over the phone.


- I have started indoor exercising again very recently. Some fun ones.


- My apartment is fairly clean. 


- I am single and live by myself, far from my home country...and going back is not an option for a few years, at least. 


- I even adopted a pet cat recently, so I could get attached... it is a bit better.

Now that we have all of these out of the way, what do you think would be best of the worsts?",4
2021-12-06 20:48:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ranlyr/question_regarding_a_solution_to_help_quit/,Question regarding a solution to help quit vaping/smoking,"When I was taking psychology in high-school, I recall learning about a solution to help people with addiction but I can't remember the name, so I'm reaching out to see if anybody could help me remember the name of the solution, if it has a name at all. 

Essentially, let's say you vape, you are drawn to the flavors that many vape companies provide, such as all the fruity flavors, Grape, Strawberry, Apple, etc. Then one day you take a hit of ""Shit-flavored"" nicotine. There's a burning sensation sent down your throat, you get a slight buzz, but you wince, scrunch your nose, and say, ""that tastes fucking awful, I do not want to hit that again"". But now lets say that shit-flavored nicotine is the only vape you have and the only flavor you can get, so you are stuck with it. You still get a buzz, but when you hit it, it's too disgusting, so you stop using it because it tastes like shit. This successfully  prevents you from wanting to vape. This is the only example I can give because I vape and my humor has devolved into poop jokes. I don't smoke cigarettes, and I don't smoke them because they leave a foul taste in my mouth, but a cigarette would certainly give me a buzz. 

I'm just trying to figure out what the name for this tactic would be, if anyone knows please reply, thanks!",1

I'm also really into growing weed although i never did it really but now in germany we will legalize weed pretty soon. Which might be the reason for me to get into it again. What should i do?

I don't want to ask in a r/ that's just gonna tell me I ""have to cut out toxic people.""

My husband is a recovering addict and was raised by addicts, a dysfunctional family that has been bringing him down every time he gets a step up. They aren't bad people, just super messed up and have never gotten themselves together, ESPECIALLY his mother who keeps asking us for money to pay her bills, even though she has a job, and we are tight paying our own. And she keeps clinging to people to take care of her until her bullsh\*t drives them away. 

&#x200B;

Her drinking is clearly the main problem and she's stuck in the vortex of it, lying that she'll get better, while inside giving herself excuses not to. It's where a lot of her money goes and probably the source of most her bad decisions. Her place is a mess, a breeding ground for depression. This is sucking us dry financially and emotionally. My husband feels a moral (spiritual) responsibility to help her and I don't want to abandon family, but every time he tries to talk some sense into her, she just nods and nothing changes. I love this man and he loves his mother, despite everything. It tears me up to watch him deal with this, when he tries to tell her from experience how she could get better, and her just not listening.

Hello. I am a mother of 2 kids, 10 and 7.  I am also married, but my husband is currently incarcerated. My 15 year old step son that we never get to see lives with his mom. Rewind to before we got the game console(s). Me and my husband talk to each other all the time, and if we werent on the phone I would most likely be working, doing something with my kids, or watching  videos on my phone. I bought a nintendo Switch in June of 2020, and that was my very fist time playing video games in about 10 years. My husband made a way to have some games sent to me to play over the next year. The switch was bought for me, but of course it ended up being a family thing. Well one day in June of this year we were at his Brothers house and all the kids were playing fortnite on his Xbox. Me and my husband thought it would be a good idea to get one for our house, and my hopes we're our kids would get to play with their step brother on fortnite. I set everything up and downloaded fortnite. But, he wouldn't play with them. Then one day I sat and watched the kids playing. It looked so fun, and I wanted a turn too. That started this whole issue. Since then, I have spent alot of my free time playing fortnite with my kids and new adult friends I met on there. It's all I want to do in my free time. I never play any of the other games I have, and only watch my phone when I'm bored and I have nothing else to do. Today a new chapter of Fortinite came out and I was really excited to see what it had to offer. My husband found out that (I got on for a total of 15 minutes throughout the day to get a sneak peek at what I had to look forward to) and said this was addictive behavior. He insists I am addicted to the game, and I am wasting time playing instead of doing other stuff that needs to be done. (Like cleaning up or reading to my kids, etc.) I understand what he means, but this angers me that he calls me an addict because I finally found something that I really like, and occupies alot of my time. Tonight I got off of work and cooked dinner, made a couple phonecalls, then got on to play the game, and this is when he got on me and called me addicted to the game. I told him he's wrong cuz he doesn't play video games so he doesn't understand how it makes me feel. Am I addicted to video games? Yesterday I even played a different game on the switch I recently downloaded because that's what I wanted to do, and he still says that shows that I'm addicted. I have never went hungry or went days without showering just to play. Sure, there are days I'd rather just play the game instead of deal with life, or work. But isn't that normal? Anyway, am I addicted? Oh, and I'd like to add that sometimes I don't get to play the game cuz he'd rather stay on the phone longer and I stopped playing it when he calls out of respect for him.",7

For around 2 years I‚Äôve been drinking daily and taking .25 mg klonopin (I‚Äôd quarter 1 mg pills). What began as 4-5 beers a day (essentially 5% as I almost never have hard liquor) to calm my nerves slowly turned into a 12-22 ((at times more, maybe upwards of 30 since I was drinking from the time I woke up till the time I went to sleep/passed out) beers and .5 klonopin a day. There were times where I had more than .5, but never more than 2 mgs in a day and I could count those times on two hands. I‚Äôm currently receiving medical rehab for alcohol but that‚Äôs only adding to the benzo list.   


My question is, what would be the best and safest way to get off the klonopin as well, I know a professional facility would be the best sololution, but if anyone had tips on how to taper off without going in-patient as this alcohol detox has basically run me dry. Any help would really appreciated and feel free to ask questions I want to know the best options I have.

The trial isn't until 2023. I can't make any sense of why she would make a rash ignorant risky decision. Her PO texted both parents that morning she escaped and put out a bench warrant where she was and the surrounding counties and if they found or were contacted to tell her to turn around and go back to rehab while she still had the chance or come back to jail and face up to 5 or more year's locked up. She contacted us of course using strangers' phones and wouldn't give us her location cause we were going to drop her ass off right back at the front door of that Rehab Facility. She continued and she had no real plan. It's like something came over her that morning and she just went right out the door with just the clothes on her back and somehow found her way to here. She was of course found and taken back to jail immediately like we tried to get through to her would happen because she was wanted and they were looking for her. 
I had prepared myself beforehand that they were going to catch her when she told me that it's fine if I don't want anything to do with her but I can't accept that as a fact that is the addict talking not her. I thought I was going to be strong and have no empathy but it's my sister were 18 months apart and have always been close until 3 years ago when the drugs started to become a habit and changed her. She had untreated trauma from our childhood, bullying, and untreated mental illness. The result of that is who is she is today and I hope deep down in my heart she isn't too far gone...

EDIT! :

Thank you to you all from the bottom of my heart. Everyone in here gave me what the back of my mind kept asking ‚ÄúWhy and How do you think to something so detrimental?‚Äù I now feel better understanding what she most likely felt from everyone elses experiences. Thank you so much everyone this has been very hard on me and I will never lose faith in her or ever stop loving her. She's even stolen from me and my Spouse but we understand she is stricken with this disease we set boundaries also and I remember now to not take it so personally when she hurts my feelings. I have hope. I can't say thank you guys enough for real!",40

I'm going to meetings, but I still go to parties.

I'm not myself when I partake. Yea, I can have a decent conversation and don't feel so afraid, but I yell at those I care about. I wake up vomiting, I miss work, and I just become even more bitter.

I want to understand this, and overcome it. I've spent too many days this way and it doesn't truly get easier. Just repeats until it has beaten your hope dead.

I want my life to be about more than getting fucked up and I want to mean something more to someone than the drunk guy that gets carried home.

Yet I'm afraid to try to get sober because it means I know I will fail. I know being around people who drink as a person who doesn't will be hard. I know people will still hold the things I've done against me. 

Getting sober doesn't mean I'm getting anyone I've lost back. People will not suddenly start loving me, nor will I get any smarter.

Is it worth being so aware for the way I'm living currently? Alone.

Is it worth it just for work, or school, or some other arbitrary reason? Do you need a good reason to get sober?

I hate it. Opioids have taken everything from me. I'm so god damned empty. All my passion is gone. I don't get hard anymore or even horny. Haven't had a girlfriend in years. I used to love playing video games, playing guitar, doing things. Tinkering, building, experimenting and researching and investigating. I was so motivated. I just never had any money.. or a good job or any real direction. I was(am still? I dont even know anymore..) so intelligent. I had so much potential. I just fucking threw everything away. All of everything. I never had shit but i did have so many opportunities.

All that natural dopamine, the systems that just drive us as humans, its just gone.. ive become obsessive with games when i try and play them because i have to psyche myself up and structure this .. organization or something to give myself the will to play, like starting at certain times and stuff and if i die or something doesn't go my way i just turn it off.. just say to hell with it, wear myself out. I just dont function like i used to. 

Whats worse... Im 30 and i work 70 hours a week. For the first time in my life i have real income, something i never had years ago even clean and the feeling of hopelessness from not being able to just make a real paycheck when i was younger used to drive to use. Its all so stupid, all these trade offs. All this gain one thing lose another. I don't even want anything anymore. I just don't care. Im so pushed down that i would just be happy to be able to have enough money to reno my RV and just have time snd energy to do thongs i used to enjoy and kist have a bit of REAL money to just do what i need to. Im so happy to just live in an RV with mg four cats.. I dont need any damn woman or people, no one had any god damn values or actual real love or care anyway and those that do won't want to be near me anyway. Doesn't matter, im fine with that and, ive always liked being alone though im very socially competent.

I can't tell if the methadone is fucking me up or the unreasonable work schedule i keep. Im a commercial fisherman, i work for an oyster farm here in CT. Im so, so, so tired.. i work from 6:30 to about 5:30 to 6, 6 days a week. Every year i have a week off and i usually sleep most of it and do nothing, it feels like my body just needs it. I feel like this is just not normal. I do a job im very good at and even though im a deckhand ive a decade of experience and i do a lot of specialized things other employees in my position can't. Msintainance and electrical. Im engineer, technician, machinery operator and deck hand all in one and i only make $15 an hour.

I make more than a lot of people just off the street Walking into some job. And with the hours it seems like a lot of money but its not. I pay like  $250 a week in taxes and its probably about to get worse coupled with the fact that my finances are a total mess because of my 20's. Just terrible credit and poor choices and bad gambles and risks. 

Im fucking tired. I jist want to feel human again. I feel like im just stuck in this misery. My brain just has no juice. No dopamine to drive my life. All those moment to moment motivators we experience daily as humans. I had to learn how to drag myself through shit. The methadone gives me all the tiredness of opiates without the pleasure.

I cant afford to leave my job. I just can't do anything right now. Im stuck. Nothing else pays enough for me to leave. I can't even shit anymore. I have a week bend of colon, its hereditary. I already had bowel issues before but now,I cant crap unless i take an enema. Im concerned for my health now. Im probably filled with shit. Im starting to gain weight and stuff and its so hard to live properly and eat right. I get out late and have  no will to do groceries sometimes with the absolutely insane traffic we have. Going home at 9pm after work just because i need to get $80 i groceries.. i had to leave my apartment and get a shitty RV and move into my mother and her boyfriends yard because its cheaper.

Im living rough working like a fucking dog AND its a farm so no overtime/time and a half.

A little background: I first tried cocaine in 2020, right before pandemic. It was a party setting, and back then I went using for a month, usually weekend only, until I quit for a year. 2021 I went back to the party setting, started with ecstasy here and there, got reintroduced to coke, and then every other weekend, turned into every weekend. I would say every weekend, and sometimes weekdays, for the past 3 months. Last time I used, was this Sunday, so about to be a week. I decided I want to quit. I‚Äôve never had a drug issue before that made me scared of relapse I guess. So I am kind of new and scared since I know I played around with a hard drug. I‚Äôve been wanting to quit, and came back a couple of times due to social pressures. Now, I never used it without alcohol. I‚Äôve never craved it without alcohol, so it is strictly party related. I know that since deciding to quit, I need to stop drinking too, and partying. However, I don‚Äôt want to forever be bound to relapse because one day I went out and had a drink‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm scared I messed my brain up and life permanently that I never get to have fun anymore. I want to one day be able to get drunk with friends without even thinking of cocaine. But my safety and health first right now. I am willing to make the sacrifices to quit right now and do whatever it takes to cure this. I just need your advise, anyone who‚Äôs been through this. Will I ever recover? Will I ever be able to drink again? What is recovery path like considering my facts? What timeline am I looking at here? I just need to know where I‚Äôm headed. I need to know what to do if I do find myself drinking and wanting. I just need words of advise, words of encouragement, and a little guidance. Cocaine for me is dead and I do not want to ever return. The risks are not worth it, the calm downs are not worth it. I just want to put it behind me forever, and be able to live my life as it was before I was ever introduced to this. Thank you anyone who will read this and advise me.",18

2021-12-03 18:18:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/r8bpx7/christmas_willpower/,Christmas Willpower,"For most of the world, December is a wonderful time of year, full of happiness, love and joy, spending time with family and friends, eating lots of nice food and overindulging on sweets, cakes and sugary treats, celebrating the life of Jesus if you're a christian, or celebrating and enjoying the festivities of Yule for pagans, giving and receiving gifts and having a day where you can just relax, be happy, and forget all of the stress and sadness that came with the year and having fun for a few days.

However, December is probably one of the toughest months of the year for me. I used to love Christmas and get so excited, I really was a Christmas junkie, having a different Christmas jumper for everyday, doing all I can to make sure I can buy gifts for everyone (one year I sold all of my Xbox games so I could get prezzies for my parents, as I tend to enjoy giving gifts more than receiving them), id go mad and decorate the whole house top to bottom, fill every branch on my Christmas tree, put the dogs in a Santa and Mrs Clause outfit, and every year since as young as I can remember, I end up getting so excited, that I'm almost always guaranteed to be ill, vomitting, with a migraine, coughing and sneezing by Christmas day purely because my over excitement literally makes me sick.. but this all changed for me a few years back when over the course of four years, December ended up traumatizing me, and then every December after that, something bad would always happen and add to my Christmas misery.

One year I lost my Grandad, who was probably the only family member who genuinely loved and cared for me and he was my everything. Another year I gave birth to my son, which you would think would be a joyous time, but I ended up losing custody of him because I was experiencing domestic abuse and my mental health suffered greatly, so December is a constant reminder of the fact that I'm not with my son, enjoying his birthday and Christmas with him. Then last year, I got assaulted at night time, punched in the face randomly by some guy and had my life threatened with a knife and I was left with horrible scars on my face, so not only was I already depressed and grieving for my son and grandad, but to top it off, I get punched in the face and terrified I was going to be killed so December is an instant trigger of my PTSD, having flashbacks to staring at myself in the mirror on Christmas day with a scabby lip, three times it's size, with a massive split down the middle and not cooling Christmas dinner because I couldn't eat with the pain of my lip.

After last year being so miserable from the assault, I have been determined to celebrate Christmas properly this year, and because I didn't celebrate last year, this is technically mine and my fiance's first Christmas. I have been planning since October and have budgeted all my money, to make sure I am able to get food for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and also budgeted an allowance for both me and my partner so we can go shopping for eachothers gifts.

I am so excited and determined to make sure everything goes to plan but at the same time, I'm so worried that I'll be a massive failure and blow all of our Christmas money on gear and not be able to get any food or presents. 

December, being as traumatic as it is, is a massive trigger for me, especially last year when I was punched, I really did blow everything and had no presents, no food, but to be honest, food and gifts were the last thing on my mind, considering I looked like I'd been stung on the lips by a hornet. So I'm not sure if I'll be just as triggered this year and worried that grieving for my son and grandad will cause me to relapse and I won't be able to stick to my plans.

Although I am so determined, and I don't want to mess it up, I really want a good Christmas with good food and nice gifts and I'm dying for things to go as planned, the thought of smoking is last on my mind, and I definitely feel like I could sacrifice spending a lot of money on smoke and only getting a small ammount if it means I can get all of my Christmas stuff, but when payday comes, I might think differently and I'm scared we won't celebrate Christmas for another year.

Please pray for me that I have the will power and strength, that things go to plan, that I stay determined and dedicated and that we have a good Christmas.

If anyone has any tips on how I can ensure things stay as planned and I don't blow all my cash on smoke, I'd appreciate it, but either way, please pray for me, think about me or just send positive vibes my way, so that we have a good Christmas.",0

Quitting everything at once seems so so so not doable for me. I‚Äôve been drinking and smoking weed. The worst drug I‚Äôve done is heroin (laced w fent) and honestly oxy was worse than that IMO. I don‚Äôt plan on going back to it. 

Today I caved and bought Xanax. The relief from taking a bar is‚Ä¶ incomparable. I don‚Äôt want to spiral. I have things I want to accomplish. 

I‚Äôve taken a lot of good steps this week in getting back on track after a detox stint from oxy and excruciating withdrawals. I can‚Äôt go through opiate withdrawal again. 

NA has taught me to believe that it WILL get worse and that this is all a slippery slope. I can recognize that in part but I also feel like hearing war stories in NA has led to new ideas to fuck my self over. 

Anyway, I didn‚Äôt even get to NA until a friend literally dragged me in after two weekends in a row of multiple friends taking care of me. That was nearly 4 years ago. 

I feel like staying away from opiates is the best I can do right now. Are there any harm reduction programs that will help me just stay away from oxy for the time being?",2

2. Take a sleeper for withdrawal, but in turn, regress into a nihilistic state of mind, where you just feel, well, empty and depressed. Like nothing matters.

It's a tough addiction and since memory can't be relied on 100%, while awake on sleepers, it's just ugh... I've been a zopiclone addict for 7 years and temazepam ain't much better, though I seem to tolerate normal benzos better than z-drugs. Feels bad and sad, man...",3

I started drinking energy drinks at the age of 13 drinking them fairly infrequently just when   
I wanted one, (I am now 18 FYI). It was about when I turned 15 that I began drinking them every day, a lot of days downing two of them. Energy drinks have proven to be extremely detrimental in my life, realising how much money I have wasted on them. I have attempted to quit on numerous occasions, but the voice in my head telling me to buy one has always beaten me. Furthermore whenever I see a convenience store I get the inner compulsion to walk in and buy one, because that routine has been etched into my mind. The most I have managed is maybe 3 days and that's about it. I dont want to be drink energy drinks anymore but I dont know what to do. thanks.",8

And  like any addiction, it's been affecting my mood and my life.

So  a few weeks ago, I decided to take it seriously and quit and it's been a  roller-coaster emotionally. My mood has been low and I no longer felt  like pursuing any of the things which I previously found meaningful (in  my case, it's my music).

If I had  to describe recovery, it's essentially a process of suffering. That is,  learning how to cope with suffering in a non-harmful and meaningful way,  to a point where you no longer need to suffer.

Anyway,  the other day I was thinking about why I continued to suffer, inspite  of how well I was doing with my recovery. I mean, I was eating right,  exercising, treating myself with respect and yet I still felt no desire  to pursue the things I once thought were meaningful.

Then the next day I woke up and it all made sense to me:

**The reason to have purpose in life is so you don't have to suffer.**

Purpose  isn't some kind of deeper meaning that's handed down to you. It's  something that you can choose, if you want it. However in order to  realise that you have that choice, you need to experience the  alternative of having purpose, which is suffering.

Now I'm completely interested in pursuing all those things which I once found meaningful.

However,  the only way I was able to come to this conclusion was to persist with  the suffering and in that way, suffering isn't a bad thing. It can teach  us things about ourselves that otherwise remaining within our comfort  zone, cannot.

Anyway, hopefully you find this helpful :)",3

Yes we tried to get him off it multiple times but because he was still in college and wanted to graduate it was impossible. He refused rehab every single time. He could not function without it and the withdrawals were horrible. He started a few medications to help him function a bit better especially when he would take breaks so that he wouldn‚Äôt crash but nothing seems to really fix the issue. We tried his way, our way, the doctors way and nothing seemed to work. We suspected he was doing this because he was depressed. Our family has been through a fair amount of hell and we think his abuse of the medication was to obviously numb himself from whatever he was going through internally. But now that he has successfully graduated this august and has been off adderal since, he is still convinced that he needs to be put on a stimulate because he has zero energy/ motivation to do anything and he drinks beer almost every day to give himself some sort of a dopamine boost. He also smoked weed but because he has a drug test for a job he got he can‚Äôt anymore.

I already tried apps that lock my phone daily at the same time but it didnt help me because a few minutes before the bedtime I would just go into my phone settings to disable those apps. Another reason is if I'm in the middle of making a note, having a important chat conversation, doing anything important, it would not be good if my phone locked in the middle of that. So these apps dont really help me. Once I put my phone away I can easily stay off it, but putting it away is very hard. MOST of these apps can also easily be bypassed (like 99% of them) I won't say how because I dont wanna ruin it for others

When im in bed first of all I simply forget to put my phone away and even if I realize it, I dont have the motivation to do it. Because of this I never get enough sleep at nights where I have to wake up early.

2021-12-02 14:11:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/r7es2y/unmoderated_review_of_southern_live_oak_wellness/,Unmoderated review of Southern Live Oak Wellness treatment center in ATL GA,"TLDR: **Southern Live Oak Wellness is Georgia‚Äôs first recruit from the Florida Shuffle. Just another incestuous treatment facility, body brokering and preying on the most vulnerable.** Do not be mislead by the reviews. They are either fake, left by staff, or coerced. They corner patients during discharge and insist a 5 star review is left, and in exchange, promise not to bill for anything above what insurance pays. Do your research prior to allowing SLOW into you or your loved one‚Äôs MIND or wallet, truly lives are depending on it.

Let‚Äôs start with the most obviously concerning. Why would a ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù EVER write a recovering addict a script for Adderall during discharge when they hadn‚Äôt ever been prescribed a stimulant prior? If someone just completed 90 days of ‚Äútreatment‚Äù (specifically for pills), wouldn‚Äôt a new script for a Schedule II amphetamine only be written under very careful monitoring? Do they discharge the recovering alcoholics with a case of beer too? Predatory practices setting newly recovering addicts up for relapse to keep them coming back for more ‚Äútreatment‚Äù aka lining the pockets of the administrative staff.

Speaking of the administrative staff, completely unethical and not new to exploitation. Several are married or living together, eliminating any type of appropriate checks and balances within a medical facility and allowing incidents to be quietly ‚Äúcovered up‚Äù. Check out the reputation of the CEO‚Äôs last facility in \*south Florida\* prior to starting SLOW. Southern Live Oak Wellness wasn‚Äôt even properly registered in the state of Georgia for the end of 2020 and start of 2021. If a business owner who is not new to an industry can‚Äôt maintain something as basic as a registration w the Secretary of State, what other serious ball drops are quietly happening? (Note: the previous facility in South Florida filed bankruptcy after his departure, and has since been acquired by a new company and management.)

The COO was ‚Äúcaught‚Äù sleeping with a behavioral tech, who was almost 10 years younger than him, and OPENLY struggling with relapsing already, to the point of needing a leave of absence to regain her sobriety. Terrifying that the COO of a treatment facility would put themselves in such a predatory place with a young female in such a vulnerable position. That same behavioral tech (while still employed) was FaceTiming freshly sober patients while she was completely inebriated then overlooked by managing staff. The following day, the two patients she was FaceTiming while drunk also relapsed. How about another behavioral tech sexting a patient the day they got their phone back in residential treatment? She's since been promoted several times. How about another behavioral tech consistently allowing the patients out after curfew while in PHP/IOP? How about two others that are coming to work clearly intoxicated.

The therapists don‚Äôt seem to have a real interest in their patients recovery or wellbeing either, instead becoming flying monkeys in the toxic family systems that arguably contributed to the addiction in the first place. Anything to please that guarantor, right? One in particular was known for projecting her own struggles with borderline personality disorder, as if BPD presents exactly the same for everyone?

Patients in both PHP and IOP who are caught relapsing on multiple occasions still receive their certificate of completion; simply bc as a newer facility, it helps their numbers of ‚Äúsuccessful graduates‚Äù. SLOW will even blatantly lie on legal documentation about it; you scratch their back, they‚Äôll scratch yours!

They strong-arm you into sober living ‚Äúprograms‚Äù that aren‚Äôt even properly established yet. A program run by someone who had relapsed and was actively using meth. He was also in an abusive relationship w the ‚Äústaff nurse‚Äù, to the point of openly sharing a bedroom and bed with her. They now have an open, pending DV case and he's since been arrested. The house manager was charged with 11 counts of theft in various counties in southern Georgia. BONUS: Remember the behavioral tech who was caught sleeping with the COO mentioned above? She was also shacking up w the meth addict running SLOW‚Äôs recommended ‚Äúsober living‚Äù program. **Again, the entire facility is one huge morally bankrupt, fraudulent pyramid scheme.**

Male patients who are being treated for addiction were regularly ‚Äúsneaking‚Äù into the rooms of female mental health patients to hook up in their bathrooms. Is SLOW even legally able to treat psychiatric patients who aren‚Äôt also struggling w addiction? A well-known local hospital (Peachtree) apparently doesn‚Äôt think so enough to file a lawsuit challenging just that.

The ‚Äúluxury housing‚Äù SLOW uses (Notting Hill in Dunwoody) is a complete joke. Drugs can quite literally be found on the sidewalks, at the pool, clubhouse, and Snapchat‚Äôs geomap where dealers advertise what they‚Äôre selling in the complex. The complex is also a 5 minute walk from a liquor store. You‚Äôd think a facility would screen all of this a bit more, considering, but not SLOW.

At best, SLOW is the blind leading the blind; at it's worst, a body brokering pyramid scheme.",7

I decided to quit 85 days ago and it's been a bit of a rocky road.

Once the initial withdrawal symptoms and intense cravings subsided, about 3 weeks into my sobriety, I was feeling a lot better and actually pretty confident. However, over the past week or so, I've found myself feeling depressed and angry almost constantly. It's kind of freaking me out, since I was never an angry person before I started using.

The only substance I use regularly these days is psilocybin; I microdose .2-.3 mg a couple times a week. I've even cut back on my use of marijuana (from daily use to once a week) and alcohol (from several times a week to a couple times a month).  I'm also in 9 hours of group therapy and 1 hour of individual therapy every week at the moment.

I don't know if this sudden unshakable irritability is due to the meth use and the damage it's done to my brain, or the deceased marijuana usage, or possibly some combination of both, paired with my natural depression and anxiety. 

Does anyone who's quit using meth relate? Is this normal? Is there something more I should be doing? Thanks in advance for any advice.",6

I‚Äôve had multiple failed attempts / relapses because mentally I wasn‚Äôt ready to stop having fun and getting high so I quit the program after a month and I had enough suboxone to last me so I thought . Ended up back in a program this time IVE HAD ENOUGH !

You have to come to a point where you just get disgusted with the drug . Realize you are getting in the ring with an opponent that you can‚Äôt win against ! You need to be honest with yourself and tell yourself you can‚Äôt win your battle with drugs you have to totally give up and say ENOUGH ! 

This time I‚Äôm back on suboxone I don‚Äôt have the urge to use as bad each day is still a struggle but I‚Äôm getting stronger and stronger each day . I‚Äôm in a program that I am committed to weekly drug test so I can‚Äôt use ! Also I don‚Äôt take my meds everyday and I plan on stopping completely in a few weeks I‚Äôve read a lot about suboxone and I don‚Äôt want to get hooked. 


Anyone needing my help feel free to pm me üòé be blessed üòò",31
2021-12-01 21:59:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/r6wzlm/san_francisco_tweek/,San Francisco tweek.,"i‚Äôm writing this not only for myself but for anyone going through addiction‚Ä¶. to give them hope that they have the ability to quit using drugs or alcohol, whenever they want to. I‚Äôm someone who believes that anyone who is using drugs or alcohol uses because they want to use. Of course with opiates and other addictions we can develop a dependency that could cause them to have fatal side effects if they were to suddenly quit‚Ä¶. but rarely is that ever the case. When your ready to quit , you will. Hitting rock bottom won‚Äôt happen once, you will hit it again, then when you pull your self back up‚Ä¶. you get fooled and continue the same habits without changing‚Ä¶ only leading to rock bottom again, and again. I was addicted to crystal meth first, then i switched to herion
 and then fetnyle. During this ongoing road to sobriety from 2012 to 2021, I‚Äôve landed myself in and out of jail on serious charges and not so serious charges with 100 percent of the reason I went to jail, had drugs involved in some way. I‚Äôve lost too many friends. especially this year with the fetnlye outbreak. I‚Äôve sat homeless outside for a few years and by 2020 I had given up hope of ever getting a real job, getting sober, or even attempting to live some sort of life on the straight and narrow. I was your typical SF TWEEKER. Only i didn‚Äôt hangout with the homeless or stay in the streets. So why am I writing this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ On September 11th 2020, CHP had attempted to try and pull me over‚Ä¶. I was upset‚Ä¶ I had a warrant . I knew no matter what i did at that point i was gonna be in a jail cell that night. So i said to hell with this and drove off. 2 min later i crashed into sf fitness going 70 mph. after i crashed the car, i got out and still ran from police who were able to catch me due to the homeless individuals that were around pointing in the direction i had fled. So fast forward‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm in jail . I‚Äôm wondering when i was gonna start to puke from the withdrawals that i was supposed to have to deal with since i had no fetnyle to make sure i would   not get sick‚Ä¶ but they never came. You see i thought i was never gonna get released from jail. I had accepted my fate and drugs were not the least of my worries. I think alot of what allowed me to not be sick was the power of my own thoughts. For the next month in jail‚Ä¶ i was having mind blowing ideas, about a business i wanted  to create, i was making plans, new goals everything just felt so right and i knew at that moment  that no matter what happens from this point on‚Ä¶ if i have my legs and i can walk, and my mind is right‚Ä¶.. the only excuse. i can have to say why i‚Äôm not happy or i‚Äôm not okay.. type deal that it was my own choice to feel that way.So. where am i at now ?? 
I‚Äôve been sober off all opiates and i have had some issues with crystal in the recent past 
but the difference in my personality my whole vibration has seriously upgraded to another level. In 2020 since october. I have developed a talent for digital art and mixed media. I‚Äôve learned how to play piano pretty damn good (seriously)in less then a year, i‚Äôve educated myself watching youtube videos,i‚Äôm currently learning python so i can start coding my own software.  I may not be where i want to be at yet with my addiction to drugs but i can‚Äôt tell you this, the hardest part is the first week only. if you‚Äôre serious about wanting to quit which if you were you would quit the second hardest thing to do is to try and not get bored because when you get bored you will tend to go back to do something that you used to do a.k.a. drugs hang out with bad friends make wrong decisions so find something that you love doing luckily I had music art to keep my attention away but just know that if I could do it you can too. your mind is very powerful stay positive think positive and I am sure that you will quit when you want to quit so I hope you remember this that high school dropout in and out of jail who has never had a job had accomplished the impossible and was able to find the strength I didn‚Äôt know that I had to pull myself up and be someone and have dreams and have goals and it‚Äôs a lot better feeling that way then feeling sick thinking of what you could do to get some money to get that drug that you so daily need that you‚Äôve traded your life away for‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs now time to take it back. I wish everyone best",2

She tells my family she hates me because I‚Äôm sleeping with her ex‚Äôs (which is not true, I‚Äôm 19 and she‚Äôs almost 50) she calls me constantly, and basically just tells her friends and other family members random things that aren‚Äôt true about me. I‚Äôm tired of family calling me at 2am because she‚Äôs telling them I‚Äôm out doing drugs lol. But the issue is nobody is doing anything about it, she broke into my family‚Äôs business (with a knife) and they basically gave her a slap on the wrist, also because she‚Äôs never technically threatened me I can‚Äôt do much. I‚Äôm really not sure what I can do myself, but I am starting to stress if she continues she‚Äôs going to do something to me/my family. Her close family won‚Äôt do anything about it, and she only ever says stuff about me, from the stories I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs never said anything bad about them so they aren‚Äôt worried and when I bring it up to them that I might be unsafe they get defensive over her and say she‚Äôs just struggling. So again. I honestly don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm asking her but since nobody wants to do anything about it I‚Äôm curious of your thoughts. Is blocking her on everything a bad idea for me? I‚Äôm honestly too scared to tick her off.",3

Idk what to do (27) or if it‚Äôs worth staying.,"My bf (34) is secretly taking pressed Xanax. Idk what to do (27) or if it‚Äôs worth staying.

My bf has been sober for 7 years, during the summer he lost his job and bought pills from his friends to treat his anxiety or stress.  He actually works in the rehab industry and his new job also is in that industry.  

I flipped out after finding out, he said he‚Äôll stop and that he was just taking half a pill a day.  I know getting off that kind of drug requires clinical treatment.   

Months go by he says he‚Äôs off of them.  One day he asks me for my norcos, says his friends wife needs it for pain on her hand.  I lied and said I don‚Äôt know where they are, later I find out he found them and used them to get high.  (I had prescribed norcos because I had surgery, but I didn‚Äôt use them because I grew up from a druggy town and will do my best to be sober.) 

Every morning my bf goes into his safe, when he gets home from work he also opens his safe.  I confronted him if he was using Xanax again and he told me no.  I asked him to pee in a drug cup and told me no and later confessed he‚Äôs still using Xanax.  

Now I feel loss and hopeless.  He is having really bad outbursts, mood swings, and overall is super detached.  He lies, and is not so sweet or understanding anymore.  It‚Äôs really fucking him up, looking from the outside in, he‚Äôs changed a lot every since he‚Äôs  been on it.  He says he‚Äôs going to get it prescribed, and he probably will because he works with doctors and they‚Äôre all friends.  

Idk if I can deal with dating an addict.  Would like some advice.   I find him very manipulative and power hungry.  Honestly I want him to get treatment because I do care.  Would love to hear similar stories and how you were able to cope with it.  Thanks.",5

The list of shady maneuvers is very long (and full of spoilers, skip this next part if you haven‚Äôt seen it. I apologize as I can‚Äôt make the spoiler tag work for some reason)

There is: Manipulating his girlfriend to give him her moms money for the bail; taking advantage of the grandmothers generosity and then stealing pain pills from her and making out (and almost having sex) with her underage granddaughter; realizing he busted the wrong guy out of the hospital, and then going on a wild chase for a drug stash based on a strangers hazy account of what happened. It‚Äôs a whirlwind of a night, a kind of ever escalating series of situations that really reminds me of my worst meth benders. 

Also, Connie violently projects all his own problems on Ray when the guy tries to get to know him better. He so clearly describes himself while insulting ray yet has no semblance of self awareness, leaving the audience to laugh at the display of his fragile ego at such a degenerate moment in his life. I have been in conversations like that before with my using buddies when they get too tweaked out (or not tweaked enough, and crashing), where I was in Rays position. It‚Äôs why I mostly use alone now and don‚Äôt have many friends. In conclusion, the events that transpire in good time very much belong in one of the shares at a group processing session in a rehab program. 

To me, the genuine desperation and skewed judgment portrayed so beautifully by Robert pattinson is what makes this the best rehab movie to me,surpassing the usual ones like train spotting or requiem. I love train spotting, but it‚Äôs a totally different world to the one I inhabit while using, so I find it hard to relate even while I‚Äôm entertained. And don‚Äôt hate me for saying this but requiem is way over the top/sensationalized, which is probably why it‚Äôs so popular. I mean, the dude gets a horrible infection and he keeps shooting into the same vein?? Move the needle two inches over for crying out loud, or shoot up into your damn leg. 

Good time, on the other hand, provides such a clear window into one mans desperate goal and the poor judgment that quickly leads him away from that goal and into fucked up convoluted situations. The fact that there‚Äôs no drugs involved honestly makes it a better rehab movie because it never triggers you, it only shows the lows that you can reach without any of the drug induced moments of euphoria. Check it out, it‚Äôs my favorite movie ever!",11
