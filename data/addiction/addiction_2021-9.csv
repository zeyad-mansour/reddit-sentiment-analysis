I hope this is the right sub to post in. If not, I do apologize. If you could redirect me, that would be greatly appreciated. I have a father who is an addict and has been for some time. He was prescribed Vicodin for some pain he had 10+ years ago and it’s all gone downhill since. In addition to the pain he had, he claimed he needed them In order to sleep since his sleep cycle is absolutely wrecked from working graveyard. I guess I can sort of believe that but I believe the root cause of all of this is depression. He hasn’t had a steady partner since my parents got a divorce. Aside from me, he really has nobody else. He feels lonely all time so my belief is that he uses in order to mask his depression. He would pair Vicodin with Xanax.

Fast forward to the beginning of 2020. He no longer could get a hold of the Vicodin so he switched to something else. I don’t have any experience with this stuff(aside from marijuana)so I don’t have a clue what it could be and was wondering if you guys could help me out. I ultimately want to help him in any way I can but he continues to deny that he’s doing anything when I know he is. I’ve lived with him 28 years until I moved out a few months ago so I obviously know him very well.

Here is what I observe when I notice he’s high:

1.	The entire place stinks. When we lived together in the apartment, he would always go into his bathroom and do it. I knew immediately he was doing it because the smell would circulate into my room by way of the ac vents.
2.	He can’t stand up straight. I notice that when he’s high, his knees give out on him. When standing in one spot, he constantly goes from locking out his knees to bending them. He hunches over like the hunchback of Norte Dame as well. So he really doesn’t have control of his muscles I’m guessing. 
3.	His lower lip hangs like no other. 
4.	Slowed and deeper breathing. Much more pronounced than usual.
5.	Cognitively absent. You speak to him and it takes him a good while to process what you told him and for him to reply. He’s overall significantly slower.
6.	His body stinks. Idk if it’s what his body is emitting after doing it or if it’s just the smell itself being impregnated into his clothes.
7.	His skin becomes pale. 

Any help would be greatly appreciate. I appreciate your time!",17,{'mask': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6683352}"

How can I help him stop being an addict?,"I am desperate and scared for my son. From 1-17 my son was a bright student, always kept his grades above Bs in fact he achieved his associate's degree while in high school via dual enrollment. Aspergers runs in the family his 1/2 brother was diagnosed, my son has some but not all the symptoms of Aspergers. The strongest symptoms is anxiety and an obsessive tendency when he starts something. This has been good when it is school or work, but can be dangerous when it it's something negative.

&#x200B;

Around his senior year he started using marijuana at the age of 18 using street pot lightly and then heavily to the point that it almost prevented him from having the motivation to get a job. My son has lived with me full-time since he was 13, his biological mother has seen him part-time . His biological mother is a heavy pot user but does not use any other drugs. I had to do a lot of oversight and assistance to motivate him to get and keep a job which he has done successfully for the past 13 months. 

&#x200B;

He obtained a medical marijuana card back in July of this year. Additionally he received the stimulus payment from the government which boosted his checking account to almost $2,500. In August 2021 we agreed / he promised to save that for moving into his own place and/or going to school by the end of the year.

&#x200B;

n Oct of 2020 I had to send my son to his mother's who lived in TN at the time for 3 months because he had an extremely toxic ""friend"" of 2+ yrs who he was extremely co-dependent on. This friend was a manipulative sociopath who was using my son for money and was getting into demonic rituals at the end trying to brainwash my son. My son broke off this relationship and then stayed in TN from 10/20 - 2/21, he came back to Florida and stayed away from that guy.... A requirement that he agreed to in order to live with me . He promised me and agreed that this guy was a horrible influence. 2/21 thru 9/21 my son works a full-time job and his Hobbies are healthy, he talks of starting school in October.

&#x200B;

All of this leads up to September 2021. 

&#x200B;

9/2/21 : My wife and I are in new jersey around 9/2 for a weekend. I find out that while I'm out of town my son was hanging out with this person again. I come home confront my son, he says he visited the guy only for a party. I tell him if he's going to not meet the condition that he agreed to to NOT see this guy then he needs to find his own place in 30 days. He says he understands and that he is going to use his savings in addition to what he is getting from work in the next 30 days to get a place or roommate. What happens next & the event details I am unaware of until September 25th:

&#x200B;

9/12: 10 Days after our agreement my son is off of work for two days. He goes to Orlando for the weekend with some new people that he met at the party from 9/2. He ends up spending $1,600. These people (2 girls & a guy he just met 10 days prior) use him for his car and his marijuana card (I find this out later)

&#x200B;

9/19: my son is off for 2 days again and goes to Orlando yet again with the same people and spends $800. 

&#x200B;

9/25: my son comes home after work, I ask him how is savings is doing, he says not well and I said how much do you have in savings? I found out he only has -0.98. He spent 2300$ in less than 2 weeks. I then find out the aforementioned details from the previous two weekends. The exact drugs I am not sure however I suspect it's either: mdma and coke or mdma & meth. He would not let me take a urinalysis so I cannot say for sure

&#x200B;

At that point I tell my son I can not enable him anymore and the only way I can trust him and allow him to stay in the house is if he does a drug test so that I know exactly what drugs he is on. He refuses to do a drug test and he leaves that night. That was 2 nights ago.

&#x200B;

Right now my son has his job as a source of income, I text my son everyday to make sure he has a bed to sleep in and gets to work. He's staying at the edge of town I believe with a a girl or group of people near the drug-infested part of town . 

&#x200B;

He has a marijuana card that I paid for (i know it was a mistake),  car insurance that I am paying for & the phone plan that I'm paying for. The phone allows me to see where he is.

&#x200B;

So my question is should I do 0 to many of the following:

1) take the marijuana card away, have him surrender it to me and tell him that if you want a marijuana card he can pay for it and self. (Its 300$ in fl)

2) OR report him to the state of Fl for abuse of the card. The people he is hanging out with are using him for the card and he is buying larger quantities of marijuana and selling it. 

3) stop the insurance on his vehicle.

4) cancel the phone plan.

5) get him into a inpatient treatment facility

6) send him to his brothers who is in Tennessee

&#x200B;

I am heart broken, I am confused and frankly at a loss for words. I'm sorry if the sentences are broken up bad grandma i m typing this on my cell phone and with speech to text and my mind is frankly scrambled.

this latest time is entirely different though after receiving ibogaine treatment and putting in a lot of effort to completely change my lifestyle. the experience was by no means easy and is not for everyone, but i already know it was the right thing for me.

i literally don’t even think about using anymore and when i do it makes me feel sick and disgusted. i’m back to the normal daily grind without this constant cloud over my head. i’m happy about the little things in life again and find myself having actual fun without any substances for the first time in years. i’m still working on cleaning up all the messes i made, but those burdens really don’t weigh on me as heavy as they used to.

just over 3 months ago it felt like getting to this point was so far away, almost unobtainable. now when i look back at it and how i was, it feels like a totally different past life. 

any of you out there struggling just know that it will eventually get better if you sincerely want it to. you may fail a few (or many) times and it may take longer than you hoped, but when you’ve truly had enough of this shit and seriously focus on getting better, it will happen.

Trying to control my Xanax usage, work, other issues very quickly led to me gambling my paycheque staying up all night using crack cocaine, xanax, and morphine. I had to work the next morning and showed up high as a kite, got fired. The stress of losing my job and enduring another rodeo lead me to using fentanyl for the first time. It’s been a blurry 2 weeks to say the least. I sold most if not all of my prized possessions (which wasn’t much and were mainly life distractions).

The withdrawals from the drug cocktails are slowly (very slowly) fading away. Day 4 with nothing in my system and free of the withdrawal torture. I went back on my anti-depressants (mirtazipine 15mg) and giving counselling another chance.

So I’ve always been a gamer but it has never been as bad until covid happened. I use to enjoy hanging out with my friends and doing things on the weekend. When all the lock downs and restrictions came in well all you could do was stay inside, all my irl friends mostly play video games so guess where I was at.. my computer.  

I developed a heavy addiction - I work 3pm-11am then I game from 12-7am go to bed wake up at 2 go to work repeat, weekend comes around I wake up eat shower then hit my computer play valorant from 3pm until 6-7am same thing Sunday. Btw it’s not like I progress at this game I’ve been gold rank for 2 months. I’ve held a full time job which is a positive I guess.

My schedule is messed,  hardly answer phone calls from people who wanna make plans or go out, chores are always prolonged same with emails and important tasks. Everything feels like I have no time but it’s because I use all the spare time I have video gaming and always feel rushed and angry when I have to do something.

What scares me is that video games are so scarily fun I play competitive ranked valorant for those of you who don’t understand this I’ll sum it up for you- 5v5 first person shooter strategy it’s intense always having my crosshair head level and peaking corners cleanly, nothing pumps my adrenaline more then a 1/5 clean ace.

For those of you who may not know, Kratom is an opoid-like plant that produces similar effects to opoids.

Wanting to get high makes me steal from people I love and generally make me act like an absolute piece of shit.

I somehow managed to quit for one month. I was feeling good, feeling proud. The first two weeks were particularly bad, I still have major insomnia even up until the relapse, but i was on a path at least. Somehow, the thoughts of using crept back in. As if I should celebrate, by getting high? What the fuck? But I did it anyway.

After using once, I told my boyfriend what happened and I dumped my stash ( I had purchased 200$ worth of kratom) and I felt proud of myself again. What do I do \*Two\* days later? Buy another 200$ worth. Like a fucking twat. In a weird way, it's harder now than it was in the beginning.

I am hoping to gain a better understanding of what it’s like to become addicted to meth and just how someone gets to that point. 

To give some back story- Haley has no history of any drug use (other than prescribed adderall) and doesn’t even drink much. Haley is 29 years old and was seemingly doing relatively good until recently. She lost her job at a furniture store due to the pandemic and before the pandemic was going to school on and off at a major university. She had been struggling with anxiety a bit before the pandemic and had to move back in with her mom despite being fully independent she was 18. Her mom moved in with her long term partner some time after and continued to pay for Haley’s apartment and had her own bedroom there to stay periodically. 
Haley has not been able to work since the beginning of the pandemic. For the past about year she has pretty much stopped hanging out with any friends aside from a very occasional dinner and doesn’t leave her apartment much. Apartment is an absolute WRECK at all times and her mother Sarah cannot figure out why. She is not taking proper care of her dog either. In the past year Sarah has also begun to notice some of Haley’s health issues. Haley is always worried about her teeth and gets braces again. She becomes incredibly thin, but it happens over time so it was easy not to notice since it happens so slowly. She also develops what Sarah thought was acne, but were actually probably just sores. They were almost always covered with makeup so it was hard to tell what they were. Sarah begins to think Haley is suffering from hyperthyroid or something like that to contribute the weight loss and mood symptoms to. Haley doesn’t have health insurance since she lost her job so Sarah gets her put on Medicaid in order to start running diagnostics. Sarah makes many appointments for her all to which Haley does not show up and blames it on anxiety. Haley refuses to see a therapist. 

Now fast forward to now. This is where weird things start to happen. About a week ago Haley had some sort of psychotic break and she tells Sarah things like “you’re not my mom” “my mom has a different color hair and than you” and Sarah tries to get her to agree to psych help, she refuses. Sarah slightly suspects she may be abusing adderall, but counts her pills and they are only a little bit off. Now Sarah gets a call from the hospital, Haley was picked up somewhere during what seemed like psychosis and failed a drug screen for meth. Sarah is COMPLETELY shocked. Now everything makes sense. Sarah has no idea where to go from here, who to turn to and resources are slim. I do not understand how Haley got here or what happened. This all happened so fast with no history of drug use. If anyone has any insight on where to go from here. Could this be because adderall wasn’t enough? Sarah called Haley’s only friends and both of them were so shocked. They knew something was going on with her, but had no idea it was so extreme and no idea where she could have even gotten it. How does this happen?",29,{'pandemic': 4},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6890198}"

Yet, you feel addicted to the abuser and panic at the mere thought of leaving. One part of you want to leave, another, stay. This inner conflict usually stems from the abusers confusing behavior, shifting from cruel to tender. You find yourself making excuses for their behaviors no matter how many times you get hurt. One of the reasons for trauma bonding is the attempt of resolving your childhood traumas through the destructive relationship. You try to get the abuser to change and love you even though they show little or no capacity for healthy love.

One way to break this unhealthy addiction to a person is to undergo trauma therapy. One of these therapies is the evidence-based treatment method EMDR. It helps you to resolve your childhood traumas, release stuck energy from your body, and give your body and mind long-awaited relief. EMDR also helps you to finally put the past in the past and give you a real chance of living in the moment and being more at ease with your body and mind.

I'm currently just over 2 weeks clean off cannabis, having smoked fairly heavily/regularly for around 20 years. I have had some breaks in there, but never managed to fully kick the habit, but now I'm determined to get off it for good.

I've jumped back on to vaping for a short period, as I found cutting out weed and tobacco all at once was too much, but I plan on weening myself off that as well over the next month or so. That's been helping with my moods, and I feel I can be a pleasant person to be around again!

However, the one thing I'm really struggling with is sleep. I've had a few nights where I've just laid in bed for what feels like hours trying to fall asleep, other nights I fall asleep FAIRLY easily, but by far the worst thing has been the really bizarre and vivid dreams! Last night was the worst, I remember seeing 1.30am, and then the dreams woke me up just after 4am, though it took me a few moments to realise I'd even been to sleep and had actually been dreaming! Only when I realised how bizarre what I'd been dreaming about was (I recall hanging out with a good friend/customer of mine, partially at his house, but out in not his garden (hope that makes sense, not a typo!), watching sheet rain come across a field, that then melted my shoes! 😳 There was more, but I can't recall it now) that I realised I'd been asleep, but I also have to rise early for work, and am not feeling at all rested.

I'd rather not replace the weed with another drug/vice, don't really drink anyway, and not a fan of sleeping pills as I'm even more groggy and unpleasant in the mornings.

I have been smoking weed for a while now. Maybe 5 years. In the beginning it was just once a month for fun. But later it began being a weekend thing and after a while I had a shitty job, anxiety daily and depression. I started smoking daily, one after work and one on the night before bedtime. This kept going for 1 year. Some days on the weekend I smoked 4 on a day. I smoked 5 grams a week. 
I wanted to make a change, me and my ex broke up, she smoked to so it made it harder to stop for me. We didn’t click anymore after 4 years together. I stopped smoking weed and was clean for 1 year. I traveled to find myself and met some nice people that also had weed.. I smoked some but had discipline because when I was going home I knew my ADHD investigation was waiting. I wouldn’t get it if I had weed in my system. 

I came home, took all the tests and vice verse and it came out I have ADHD. I’ve had a hard time my whole life with this and many days of hating myself. But 23 years old and now I know. 

I started smoking weed again after this, still very depressed and having adhd meds and antidepressants. Now I have been smoking regularly again. I smoke 3-5 grams a month instead of week. I have tried 2 weeks of only smoking at weekends, this was nice but felt like all I was waiting for the weekend cause I don’t enjoy my work atm, I’m mildly depressed. It wasn’t hard until relapse, now I smoke everyday again. 1-3 a day.  
I love weed, I love how it helps me calming down and feel happier. But now I get anxious I’m getting addicted. I was home from work yesterday to relax and smoke..

 My girl is all for the weekends, she don’t like that I do it on the weekdays. Stopping smoking weed for my whole life sounds scary and really boring. My dream is to smoke less, have a balance. Is this possible or should I stop cold turkey? It scares me a lot. What should a guy do?

Love the way they feel but as I already knew since 14, it’s done nothing but harm my life and self when I’m not on them(or even when I am on them) clearly.

I started off with weed, alcohol, adderall. Weed stopped working, so I drank more but that also stopped working. Now for the past 2 years I’ve been stuck on stimulants. I went through a morphine and codeine binge but thankfully I can’t find anymore because I probably would’ve died the insane doses I would take.

I’m also heavily addicted to my nicotine vape. Like so addicted that when I try to cold Turkey, I have a legitimate mental meltdown and cave in. Even with weed I go crazy like crazy crazy if I don’t smoke. And of course stimulant cd’s and wd’s are extremely depressing but I numb it all w smoking weed and vaping or drinking. Even tho these things sometimes make me feel worse. 

Especially smoking bwcause sometimes I’ll start overthinking about my life when high and get bad anxiety.

I’m managing to function at this new job that I love actually. I did miss one day because of a night I was up didn’t sleep recording some amazing ass music w my good friend (doesn’t do hard drugs which is nice)

I’m so embarrassed about that as this is only my 2nd week.

But man I have bills to pay, I just started this new job and like it and just spent 2 months without work because of getting depressed and quitting my last job. I blew through grands and grands that I had saved within that 2 month period. I don’t think rehab is an option. I just started this job I really like after being broke and putting off bills. But ya Ive tried that and nothing else seems to work to get me off drugs. Even when I’m only smoking weed and vaping, I eventually relapse on harder stuff always, buti can’t even seem to quit weed or nicotine. And My tolerance gets so high they wont even do anything anymore. only thing I’ve been able to stay away from is caffeine because my heart couldn’t handle that on top of other stimulants anymore.

Last night i relapsed and had all the motivation to get sober today. Put on the nic patch, dumped my drugs out, smoked the last of the weed. Then got my vape from the trash, proceeded to hit w the patch on, and got more weed. I know I can’t do anymore hard drugs tonight because even tho I’m 19 my heart is fucked and I also don’t wanna comedown even harder.

A. Haven't done sport in a few years. I got extremely lazy as my addiction uses all the free time I have.

B. Lost a lot of friends because of me not keeping in touch. Guess why?

C. My job isn't very monetary fulfilling in my country, the number of people trained for this job extremely high for the amount of demand and I don't have the power to start from 0. About 600 euros/month salary. Idk McDonalds 6 hours shifts are about 300$ in here. Out of my friends/collogues I feel like everyone evolved a little more then me and I stopped evolving because mainly because: 1) I got lazy and gamed a lot 2) because my job is stagnating, like my position in a small company. 3) I stopped reading.

Also, It's a narrow segment, not like coding or economics where you can start something new and not start from 0. And I don't want to leave this shitty country, maybe I should have.

D. Never had a real relationship, had a few GFs as a teenager, was a lot, lot easier in univ. Didn't felt like I need it. I'm maturing very slowly, but I think it's finally happening. Where do people find friends/gf out of school? it's weird.

Struggling addictions:

1. WoW, quit several times, relapsed several times because of social connections, last time stopped in august, and I'm thinking of going back. Not having a real social life, I get bored, I have social connections in there so i turn back.

Hearthstone: I got tricked into logging in to do the 3 quests/day mentality, but that one in 3 days takes about 2 hours to complete and also some quests suck and I need to log in to ""reroll"" them.

Sunken cost fallacy on both of them. I had fun with them, I don't have anymore. It feels like a waste of time, but I can't stop.

Alternatives found: Xbox game pass: smallest problem of all, there are single player games/multiplayers that you enjoy for a couple of days, then quit. In and out. I'm not interested in so many games in general. But the WoW and daily routines games tricked my games into that.

2. YouTube: when I'm not on PC, I'm watching something related on YouTube. Like 2 hours a day at least. Entertaining, yes, but a fucking lazy waste of time. Looking for replacements that aren't as addictive.

3. Reddit, again everything gaming related. I need a new passion cause this is self destructing.

I would join the military just to break the vicious cycle, but I know it's not a career I would enjoy.

She had moved out of our house when she was 17 after graduation with her associates from college. She moved back into our home when covid hit.

She was obviously not in this world, in fact it really scared me beyond belief. I didn’t understand she was on heroine and thought she was drinking. Yes she is a alcoholic also. She couldn’t walk but she got in her car and drove to the store. She could have killed someone including herself. She went upstairs and remained in her room for 24 hours.

I thought it was him on the pictures but it had been over two years since I last seen him. Naturally, I went to the comment section and saw person after person identify him and a few saying he’s homeless (something I already knew) and an addict who’s constantly on the run and stealing at every chance he gets. 

I don’t live near him and haven’t lived near him for over 10 years. However, I can’t shake this feeling that I should do something for him. Should I call the local police and see if they can help? At this point it appears he’s committed enough crimes to be put away for at least a few years.

However, the past weekend included a bender followed by the expected apologies and promises of never doing it again. Along with that, he lost his job over the weekend since he didn’t show up to work (due to a miscommunication). I leave for a 2.5 week trip half way across the world at the end of the week and I am worried sick about him (also for our cats because they always seem to get out when he’s using due to his forgetfulness of leaving doors open). I’m fearful losing his job will send him into a depressive/anxious state that will lead him to relapsing while I am gone, especially with so much free time with him not working. He asked what he can do to make me feel better about leaving and we talked about him seeing his therapist again, a friend staying with him at our house (said pal is in between houses so it’s not weird), and finding a new job before I leave (although this will be difficult considering he now has a record). No progress has been made with setting up an appointment nor has he talked to that one friend about it. I recognize I am not responsible for his actions but I am very anxious about leaving and I am not sure what the right thing to do is. I try not to be angry with him or lecture him like a mom, but I’ve always felt like I struggle with riding the line between supporting him and enabling him.

I have been with my gf(A) for 5 years. I met her after she moved to my state (she was trying to get away from a 6 year heroin addiction after being clean for a year) and we became best friends and eventually it turned into something more. At first we used smoke weed, as time went on we started to do more coke and meth. I thought it was normal, that as a teenager I was just “having fun”. When she suggested one day that we try heroin, I figured I had already done meth and what did I have to lose? At first I didn’t use constantly, but in 2018 my dad passed away, and after that I began to numb myself. A and myself began to use everyday, and I began to experience withdrawal, and that’s how the cycle started.  I burned through $15,000 from my dad’s will in 4 months, went from smoking to IV and didn’t graduate when I was supposed too. A and I continued to use for the next 3ish years. Many things happened in between- I cheated on her and she cheated back to hurt me, she got a DV after trying to choke me and went to jail,; my family despised us and all the little things in between. But we’ve stuck it out. I eventually ended up getting clean with the help of my family and I have stayed clean for almost 2 years but A has not. She is now living with another addict and is still deep in her addiction. As a result of our addiction my family despises her and I now have to sneak around to see her. I love her very much and feel conflicted. I want her to get clean so we can have a normal life. A tells me she wants to be clean, get a job and be responsible, but I see zero effort being put in. I’ve waited since I’ve gotten clean to hopefully see that effort being made but it seems hopeless. I have told her how important it is to me. But it’s always all bark and no bite. I feel awful that if I made the decision to leave that she would have no one. I don’t know where to turn from here.. Do I stay and hope that she eventually decides to get clean and risk her possibly not stopping?

When I turned 17-18 I managed to put my hands on (what was legal at the time) “fake weed” it was sold to give you a high that was said similar to weed. I had to go with a different brand that time around since they were out of the other!

It basically looked like different dried up herbs with some chemicals added to it!

That one only said THE MIX 

So I go home and during the evening I went downstairs and took a puff of it! Didn’t really feel much initially, even after I had walked away so I went back and took another! Bad call!!

That very instant my chest felt cold and I lost all recollection of where I was. Everything went fucked up after that! I remember having this feeling I was falling but the same time my head was being thrown left to right! It felt like someone had my hair gripped and kept moving my head violently. I remember seeing a lot of colours and patterns. Almost like I was in the white noise/snow of an old TV with no cable

I could hear something really loud and agressive in the background but was so lost in my own mind that I couldn’t figure out what it was, but it was our family dog barking at me! Last moments of my trip were when my dad shook me “back to reality” shaking me by my shoulders! 

Imagine being somewhere else COMPLETELY in your mind and then someone (literally not figuratively) opens the curtains right into your world. From this moment on my agony was over (if hell exists, it must feel this way)

But I was left confused, my father walked me up to my room, made sure I was going to be ok and walked out. I didn’t want to say/admit it at first but I had a hard time remembering who he was! I knew I could trust him but it is only when He walked out of the room that I realized in stupefaction that I had for a minute forgotten the existence of my dad! 


The following morning I was told my trip had only lasted 15-20 minutes, but it is a short amount of time I would never want to experience again!
It took me a couple days to feel normal again! I felt strange, it scared the shit out of me",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53999585}"

So, to start things off, I'd like to say that I'm most likely addicted to video games, entertainment (youtube, netflix), foods and possibly even consuming lots of information (but not acting on it).

&#x200B;

What I mean by that is that I have no desire/motivation/drive to do the things that I know are better and I literally feel no pleasure in doing them or their consequences, but instead do the things that I find immediately gratifying (even though their gratification has been significantly less over many years). 

&#x200B;

I've listened to the podcast/interview that Andrew Huberman made with  Dr Anna Lembke, and they've mentioned a dopamine fast/reset. I have a place where I can detach myself from the computer and leave all my devices at home so that I'd be detached from social medias, video games, entertainment, youtube/netflix and so on.   


This brings me to my main point- how do I do it? How do I know which activities I should abstain from and how long? I'd be staying at my grandmas place, I'd even give her my credit card and my cash so that I'd not impulsively go and buy foods or alcohol. I'm positive in the fact that I'd have the right environment to do so, but I'm wondering what activities could I be doing that wouldn't take away from that reset?  


Working out and in general being physically active is probably good (like walking, jogging, maybe some disciplines of sports). Meditation is good. Helping people locally is good (like volunteering). What about reading books and developing new skills? Are these activities considered stimulating? Like what's the formula by which I could check whether the activity is suitable for that period or is rather too stimulating?",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7267606}"

went to a meeting today, i’ve been going to very loosely 12 step-based meetings for a while but today was the closest to normal 12 step i’ve been to. there are a bunch of reasons why I feel out of place:

my addiction wasn’t anywhere near as bad as most people’s. it makes it hard to relate, and it makes me think that all these people were so deep in addiction that they can never return to using but that maybe I can. who knows if that’s true or not

I don’t have, never will have a higher power. raised atheist, briefly identified as agnostic, and then depression killed any spiritual inclination I might’ve ever had. I am quite the nihilist largely because of depression, but in the sense that nothing fucking matters but i’m stuck here anyway so try to make it worth it

the big book was written forever ago and you can tell some of the outdated principles, eg women and men aren’t supposed to be each other’s sponsor/sponsee. not all men and women are dying to fuck each other also i’m gay?

12 step is so rigid! recovery is not linear. it’s not 12 little checkboxes. there’s no one book that has all the answers. recovery looks different for every single person, and 12 step doesn’t allow for that

too many men. not all but some are misogynistic, which makes me horribly uncomfortable. but mostly, it’s so much harder for me to connect with men or feel included when in a male-dominated space.

I am addicted to vaping, weed, and porn. For almost 2 months now, I have been trying very hard to come clean from all of them. I was successful in pushing away vaping for a few weeks but haven’t been able to stay away. I am on a big health push in my life for the last couple weeks, eating healthy, exercising, etc. but those 3 things are definitely holding me back from not only that, but achieving my potential and living a more stable life. I really want to devote all my energy to accomplishing my goals, but I am aware of the fact that these constant dopamine hits from all 3 are ruining my brains’ reward center and I’m worried if I can’t stop my addictions my brains ability to reward itself for hard work will diminish. 

I am very resolute that I want to change this, there’s no doubt. Yet, every day I’ll get these times where I think of doing something for whatever reason (bored= “weed will help me stay interested in this”) (feeling unergetic while studying= “my vape will help me stay stimulated”) (see hot girl-> not be able to control my thoughts-> “porn will help me get my mind over this and I’ll be able to get back to work”)

My issue is, that I have an employee that I'm very happy to have on my team. He's well liked by our team and I personally see a lot of potential in him and after some discussions with my supervisor, I think we can agree that we'd rather try and help this individual than let him go.  


So what's wrong?  


Well, as time has gone on, I've ran into issues of him chronically lying or fabricating details to stories. Today he damaged some product (which is fine, I actually made it a point to let him know that he won't be written up, and that accidents happen)- the issue arose for me when he started trying to shift the blame onto an elderly coworker who wasn't near the incident that I was a first person witness to.  


On top of this irksome issue, it's been a consistent problem trying to get him to follow important procedures. If I had to guess, I'd say that he's easily distracted and *shouldn't be punished for that* if he's trying, which *I feel like he is*. However, some of our procedures are important for the safety of our customers and employees, and I don't just mean scrapes and bumps but far more serious consequences.  


And last but not least there does seem to be a complete disregarding of boundaries for myself and others. From asking to date other employees (expressly against our HR policies) and stalking my estranged father in I believe an unpredictable and strange attempt to ingratiate himself towards me.  


*In spite of all these concerns*, I love having him around. He's optimistic, even if it doesn't always seem genuine. He's motivated, and for the most part shows up on time and completes his shifts. I'd love to go on about all the things I love about this individual but for the sake of your time, I'd love to turn the time over to you to offer some advice.  


What have your employers done to help you or you wish they would have done to help you during your recovery? What are some do's and don'ts for individuals in recovery and their long term success?

Will It Work?](https://reason.com/video/2021/08/06/oregon-decriminalized-all-drugs-to-stop-overdoses-will-it-work/)  Text:

>Oregon is once again at the vanguard of reform: In February, it enacted Measure 110, a law ending prison and jail sentences for all types of drug use and possession, whether it be cocaine, meth, heroin, or psychedelics...With the new law, not only does possession bring nothing more than a $100 ticket, defendants can get the fine dismissed if they place just one phone call to a drug abuse assessment hotline...

>Monta Knudson, executive director of Bridges to Change, which helps drug offenders who've recently been released from jail or prison transition into housing and reintegrate into society, says that the new law will greatly expand treatment access...(But Knudson also offered a different perspective.)...

>""There [will] always be folks that are entering the addiction system that might not need treatment and might not want treatment,"" says Knudson. ""And to be honest, if they're not causing community harm, then why should they?…

>There are...recreational drug users who don't have a substance abuse problem.

So no engagement with  people who use hard drugs and who *don't* have an addiction problem?   And who don't want to be bothered by drug counselors?  Is this workable? Apparently other states are looking at adopting the Oregon model.  Some people suggest this decriminalization model is the ideal path for downsizing the War on Drugs.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.55429476}"

Like I cant even go to the er or hospital without being made fun of because I have a beard and a vagina and wear a binder for a flatter chest. So of course I dont want to feel that trauma of just existing (and living with my severely transphobic mom who bawls her eyes out that I'm a nonbinary trans man that has gone through HRT instead of a more miserable pre transition me)...no one respects me, everyone misgenders me, I get called a bull dyke WITH A FUCKING BEARD, and a lesbian. Like I'm so lesbian I grew a beard or some shit. Like that's even a fucking thing 🙄 and not like I havent dated men in/before/after transitioning with hormones. It's fucking hard being trans, no where is safe. Being transphobic is a fucking bipartisan issue, like its not just Republicans being shitty to me, ots everyone. I didnt realize this was a huge reason for why I do drugs--i hate myself because I'm told to hate myself and I deserve to be invalidated about myself and my gender. My mom literally doesn't want me to exist unless I detransition and fit her image of what a girl should be, what her ""daughter"" was before I moved out and realized I was trans. I cant win, im invalidated as a cis woman and as a trans masc person. Like why should I be alive if everything is misery? I dont know why I didnt come to that conclusion sooner that the gender trauma was why I wanted to mildly robo trip and abuse every drug I could find. It fucked up my brain, I feel dumber now since even quitting. I'm afraid I lost my ability to draw realistically which I was good at before but it changed after I stopped using DXM and otc drugs and opiate sensing muscle relaxers. I dont know. I just needed to talk it out to realize this. I dont trust telling my therapist or psychiatrist about this either. I dont know if they even see me as masc or if its lip service and they secretly dont think I should exist. 
So...yeah at least I know now and can hopefully deal with it. I've lapsed so much it should just be considered active addiction. I'm 4 days off DXM and 10 days off pills which is huge for me. I usually cant get to 2 weeks of sobriety but im trying now. Its such a struggle, especially being dependent on my trans and queerphobic parents...Its fucking hard. I cant even bring myself to flush down my cough medicine because its like a comfort item, even though it'll temp me more to abuse.
I dont know how to end this rant...if you made it this far thank you for putting up with it lol.

I am writing in regards to my 24 (M) younger brother. My brother just broke up with my sister inlaw last week they were together since 15 years old and she came to live with us at the age of 15 because her single dad took off on her. My mom has seen her as a daugher since then. At 17 years old  they got their own place and have had constant party lifestyles since my mom kicked them out. Eventually they managed to straigten out on and my mom bought my brothers ex a car and even cut up my expensive lulu sweater to make her sleeves longer. My mom has always talked about how pretty and thin she was and told her she was the daughter she always wanted which kinda hurt but i knew she needed a parent and a role model.

It was often hidden from me, the drugs, drinking and partying. My brother and I are the best of friends but as they went on party benders he wouldn't answer for months at a time. I realize now this was because things were being hidden. This weekend he admitted to her stealing all their rent money, hustling family for cash and snorting it all after finding messages in her phone about her having sex with other guys and then drunk drove the car my mom bought for her and he took the keys and took the car away.

My brother admit he drinks 7 days a week and snorts coke daily.

At first i was so angry but i listened lovingly. I told him at this point im holding you accountable clean yourself up before i have to tell our mom and she has a break down. text me daily and look me in the eyes the lies stop today, ill be here for you.

I spent the week cooling off because i was ready to kick in her door and beat her up... lol I would like to sit his (now) ex girlfriend down and tell her this weekend:


"" i love you, i appreciate the bond we created over the years but......As a older sister It is my duty to protect my younger brother, if you want to tank your whole life thats up to you. My mom and dad have done more then enough for you. Back down! Do not ask my mom for money or come around my brother anymore ill ring the alarm and tell everyone about the drug use. I don't know why you want to tank your life and put all this shit up your nose after all everyone has done for you im dissapointed. Also, If my brother overdoses or dies because of the drugs I am not afriad to do jail time. There will be consequences, tell your friends. I am not fucking around.""

I've never lied to him before and we have always had open communication, except for this. 2020 was the worst year of my life and also when I got with my current boyfriend. I got hooked on meth by a coworker. Shit I even told him she let me try it when I first tried it. But didn't tell him I kept using. It's been destroying my body slowly and he kept gave me openings to tell him but I would lie telling him it was the psych meds my doc was prescribing, and he trusted me cause I've never lied to him before. So he was thinking I was having some major health issues trying to figure out what was wrong and was getting scared for me. And I just couldn't tell him. Well after a friend called me out yesterday it finally hit me how bad I was. My friend immediately looked at me after not seeing me for almost a year. ""Omg, you look like you've been doing meth for awhile"" and that was my breaking point. So I went home hoping my bf would help me quit and support me through it. Terrified it would be the other option because I literally have no support system. I have no one but him. So I was scared if he left me and kicked me out, I knew I'd be dead fairly fast. 

So I went home, immediately cried hysterically in his arms,as I walked in. Told him I need his support more than ever and I need his help cause I can't do it alone, I've tried. Said Id understand if he leaves me but I really hope he stays and helps me get through this. He agreed he would help but said all trust is gone now and it may never come back but it can. If I relapse he will be done with me. And I know I won't. All I needed was his support to help me quit cause I couldn't do it alone. And I have no desire to use again. I hated the high the whole time. I used it more for self harm cause of a lot of mental depression and trauma I was dealing with but I dont want to hurt myself anymore. 

Anyways, today is day one of detox. I am feeling so worthless because I know have to be constantly watched and have certain that rules are set. Basically I'm on the other end of what I had to do with my ex a long time ago who was addicted to heroin. I never thought I'd be on this end of that. Never had a desire to be hooked on drugs, in fact made it a point for years not to try the more addicting ones because addiction runs in my family bad. And last year my life fell apart while also getting better at the same time(hard to explain) but I got hooked. And I fucked up. I always promised myself I wasn't going to be like my mother, my dad, I've seen how drugs can ruin people and family. I just want to be done with this and be happy and have a good life. I will never touch it again but I'm so scared my bf will never trust me again. That's what hurts the most out of all this. I didn't care that it was destroying my body and that I hated the high, I cared that I kept lying and couldnt fucking tell him sooner. A whole fucking year with this lie. How can anyone be trusted again if they can go that long? I loved how our relationship was better than I've ever had in the past because we were so honest and open with each other. I want that back. I want it back so bad. I don't want to be constantly watched and check on cause he will never trust me again. 

What should I be prepared for with this detox? I wasn't a heavy user. Had a strict schedule I went by. $10-20 a week is what I spent. 3 days on 2 days off. 1 week break once a month. Everytime I tried quitting, I'd have a trigger or sleep paralysis which would make me relapse.

So this is a long story that my family and I have been dealing with for 5+ years now, and I’m going to try and make it short and sweet. My brother is an addict. It started with oxy, then moved on to much more. He went to rehab twice now, been to jail, od’d multiple times, the whole nine yards. Now he is living at home with my parents and I, trying to get him motivated and back on track in life.

Anyways, my dad and him went on a road trip for a couple of weeks just earlier this month. About a week before their trip, I found my brothers wallet on the floor full of meth (I think), heroin, and Xanax. Before then he was supposedly clean and going to NA, he even still does. It was a mess when I found them, and we tried to talk to him. He lied over and over, which is extremely frustrating. Sometimes I feel like deep down he thinks we’re idiots and can get away with anything. Sadly he does because my parents can’t bear to kick him out. Well my dad ended up taking him on the trip anyways to help revitalize and motivate him. Well they get back a day ago, and all seems fine. My dad said he was happy and completely normal, they had a blast. I spoke with him and he had life in him and was acting normal.

Well the next day, I notice my brother is immediately acting weird. Leaving things all over the house, getting distracted, fixating on random ideas, forgetting he moved things to the point he asks if I’m messing with him, just all around strange erratic behavior. I think that maybe he just didn’t sleep well because he has a problem with it. I talked with him calmly and nicely, asking what changed in the last day for him to be acting strange. I asked if he took anything and he got a bit defensive. My dad immediately notices he’s acting strange when he comes home and assumes he’s high. We go to dinner and he’s sweating bullets, face red, and even nodded off a few times at dinner. The strange thing is that he will be engaged in some conversations randomly and not speaking jibberish (which I’ve seen before). I was pissed because we were at dinner with family. I kept it together and didn’t get angry, but I assume he took something. On the way home we talk, and an argument ensued. I beg him to please be honest and just tell us what’s going on but nothing. He goes on about how he can never win because we assume he’s high all the time. He gets very defensive and argumentative, even though I didn’t want to argue in the first place. Makes us feel like the crazy assholes because we ask if he’s on something, then gets us worked up and says we need to calm down. It’s a frustrating cycle.

When I started typing this, I basically wanted to ask am I the crazy asshole for thinking he’s high, but as I typed this out I realized that this is the same thing that’s happened everytime. We ask if he’s high, he gets defensive and gaslights, leads to an argument, then the next couple of days he’s sick from withdrawals and tells us the truth. The worst part is, if even he is going through some health issue causing these symptoms there is no way any of us can believe it.

I'm not gonna get in the way of his progress but it still hurts like a mf,"Met with my ex last night, yeah, we met to sleep with each other.  Thats all it was, thats all I knew it would be. We saw each other the evening before too, but that was to see a film so couldn't really talk. 

After, we got talking.  He said things are going well for him right now, he's working and then going to the gym and his spare time is focused on his kids. Soon as he's done with the day he goes home has a shower and dinner and gets in bed. Everything he has done is to keep away from drugs and its helping him.  He still has a lot of debt to clear but he's focused.  He looked good and had a positive mindset.  I'm so proud of him, he's doing everything I tries to get him to do when we were together. 

On the subject of us, he said he doesn't think we would work, especially right now.  He doesn't want anything to stunt his routine right now while he's still technically sorting himself out and he fears that we could end up back in the cycle of how we were.  He doesn't wanna be able to blame me for any slip ups he could have with drugs, he can only blame himself right now and he also wouldn't like the comments that could come from my family, since we had a bad break up.  I explained that wouldn't happen now because we're both aware of the issues and can both proactively work on making sure it doesn't happen again, I'm also working on the way I bring topics up and learning to be more secure and my family would be supportive of his changes. However I stressed that I wouldn't wanna get in the way of his progress and completely understand so I won't push for more.

I asked him if he loves me, he said he loves me but doesn't think he's in love with me but said it doesn't necessarily mean it won't change in the future, he's just too focused on himself and his kids right now.  He doesn't want a relationship with anyone despite stressing that I was never a negative on his life and was very supportive and is taking my advice in seeking a new group of people who don't take part in drugs. He said he's happy to be friends with me and do things together now and again.  He would rather be friends than be enemies because I'm the first ex he's been able to leave on good terms with.  Although he also said that he understands if it's too hard for me to do this because of how I feel but he will be progressing with or without me.  In regards to sleeping together, he said it can't happen again because it won't do either of us any good and he doesn't wanna lead me on.  

This was the most open and honest conversation we've had.  While it hurts to know he's not in love with me, I'm appreciative of his honesty and finally letting me know where I stand.  I'll try to not dwell on this and continue to live my life but I do hope he wants to make a lasting, happy relationship with me in the future.  This is the man I'd love to spend the rest of my life with.",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4582036}"

I love him so much, but I only love him as a friend. I have been holding off on breaking up because I’m afraid he will drink himself to death and he has no one else. We went to the ER about 6 months ago for chest pain, there the doctors told him his liver enzymes were too high from alcohol abuse. He went to a detox center and stopped drinking for maybe a week after detox, then started drink craft beers because he “couldn’t drink too much of those” and then slowly started ordering shots, bringing beer home, and then started bringing the vodka home again, I keep finding little airplane bottles everywhere. I don’t even drink anymore because it honestly disgusts me. I do enjoy the occasional edible after work- meaning I will eat one gummy out of a 10 gummy bag. I woke up to realize he has consumed about 1500 MG of edibles in the last two days… I honestly don’t know how he’s been awake for any of it. He’s also consumed a handle of vodka, a smaller bottle of Jamison, and probably at least a dozen airplane bottles— all in two days. When I bring things up, he gets really defensive. I don’t want that, I just want to help and get him in a position where I don’t have to worry about him dying if I pursue my own happiness.

However ever since I learned she was on the same stuff and we did it together it has literally dragged me down.  I never use to be so hungry for it but I can still manage to step away from it but when she and I catch up that is our go-to hang-out activity.  I'm a grown adult but I also am finding it difficult to not be completely isolated from it.

Losing my dad made us both go into separate states of grief and loss.  She never introduced me to it,  I went to a new country and started working and making money to support myself and go into savings.  So I started to experiment and was introduced to it by friends.  I used it to keep the party vibe going for three days then went back to work for the next two weeks. and so on.

My mother looking sicker and sicker by the minute and I don't want to stay away from her however when we are together it is hard to fight off the expectancy urges of using.  She doesn't want to stop even when she says it cause her actions don't match up to her words.  I have now only done it when in contact with her yet I also am a bad influence because I don't refuse it even if I got nothing to do on it when I leave her

I know it's a shitty-looking relationship but the woman is the kindest person you could ever meet.  Her habit is a shitty one but literally does not define her character.  She hopped on it cause she was depressed and it made her happy.  The drug is also making her loose her mind and forgetting where she put things or being oblivious to certain situations and makes her unable to handle stressful situations.

Please do not critizse her for her parenting but think of her as someone who is a struggling depressed person who has been judged her whole life.  I'm just going to accept what my mum does but I want the strength that I ONCE  had where I could sit in the middle and watch it all happen around me and not be urged or curious or even tempted to have some.

At 17 I started experimenting with psychedelics heavy with friends, like I probably took acid 10 times during one semester of junior year in high school. At 18, during my senior year, my brother had introduced me to molly and cocaine. During my first semester at college I got completely black out drunk and totaled my car (crashed into a tree thankfully). During my second semester I tried to turn things around and cut out weed and alcohol. In a certain aspect I was successful, in the course of 4 months I drank once and smoked twice. However during this time I had 2 full trips and about a dozen micro-doses with acid and began buying adderall (probably bought 20 20mg pills) which I really enjoyed. Which brings us to now, my first semester of sophomore year in college. My first night back going out I was introduced to a coke dealer who lives 2 min from my place. So the next morning after my coke binge, the first thing I do I hit him up for a half gram. Once I blow through that in 2 days I cop a gram, which I also blow through in 2 days. Next I try to cop an eighth but the guy ghosts me. Then I decided to go back to adderall for the super euphoric feeling it gives me and have bought 10 pills in the course of 2 weeks. It’s gotten to the point to where I don’t care what the substance is, as long as it makes me feel better and I have access to it, then I’m gonna consume it. I’m tired of the only good parts of my life coming from me not being sober, so my question is that if I want to combat this should I try going completely sober, or just cutting out some drugs, or something else completely.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5067193}"

She knows all about my addiction struggles, and she helped me through most of them. But I still just find myself so angry. Even living a normal well-adjusted 9-to-5 family life","I don’t even wanna say this to you right now, because I don’t want you or anyone to feel responsible in anyway, these things just happen. No need for guilt or pain, just an examination of the facts. Ya know, the kid to the left of me could’ve gone through the same things and not experience the PTSD that I’m feeling now. But it literally started when you guys caught me smelling like smoke coming home from school one day because i had smoked a little on my way home. And I had smoked for whatever reason, experimentation, to fit in, to lessen the effects of some other undiagnosed mental issue. But I was pretty normally functioning so I don’t think it was that last possibility, but I’m no psychologist so I can’t say that it wasn’t that last one. But that day that you caught me you locked me down, like you put me on the bus and then you got me off the bus. And I would just be home. No friends, who were everything to me, no weekends, and lots of restrictions at home too. And of course as adults you guys knew that this was just a passing phase in life is so long and that this wouldn’t even matter a few years down the line, I would be living a different life with different people and this was just high school. But because I was a child didn’t know that. And because of how much I cared about my friends and my burgeoning sense of self, that damaged me. And please please please believe me when I say as a parent I don’t know what I would’ve done with a child like that. Maybe the EXACT same thing, although I mean, because of experiences I have now, I doubt it. It almost certainly wouldn’t of been the lock down, that was just such a fear-based reaction and you were just like under the impression that if you could hide me away from the world and my bad influence friends then I would be fixed. But what it really did was force me to be sneaky, I started smoking at school, and at night at that point because it’s the only time I had around peers, lunch periods, and cutting classes to smoke. I even got caught and suspended for having pot in school. But school was the only place you weren’t. Where Dad wasn’t especially. I still look back at my last couple years of home life during high school and feel absolutely horrible. But that’s not to say that during those years I didn’t have a tremendous amount of fun and love from you guys and most the things that a young man needs to succeed. Just not all of them. I remember I had to go and talk to a therapist and explain what was going on so that she could explain to you guys that that kind of parenting was damaging and not really acceptable for someone my age. And after that you started giving me my freedom backAnd that was around between 2007 and 2009 which is when the opiate crisis really started on Long Island, and I became a full-blown addict. This is despite the fact that you locked me down all those years, Because now I wasn’t really hung out with or been close with Rashaun and Max and Sean anymore, a year and a half and high school is more than enough time for people to grow apart. In fact I’m still trying to rekindle my friendship with Rashaun 13 years later. So I had to find new people, and these new people were so so much worse, and of course I couldn’t see that at the time. That’s not something I chose intentionally to steer myself into. But it happened and before I knew it I was a full-blown opiate addict, Going to a rehab at 18 or 19 years old where I’m the only one there under 30 years old. And I’ll always be grateful for Veritas Villa and you putting me there, though I may not have been ready yet it did plant a seed. And I said all that just to say this, that’s where the roots come from, from the anger of the miss management of my behavior, from the anger of these pharmaceutical companies and doctors who have literally changed my life forever in such a negative way by pushing their poison to everybody who would take it. All for a little slice of that big-pharma money. And because of that fact One of my best friends, my brothers, is fighting a losing battle to make it through this every day, and two of my BEST friends are fucking dead and cold in the ground because of it all. And I see their faces everyday and see their smiles and their laughs. Remembering making Juan laugh with this voice I used to do makes me cry EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I’m fucking furious. I wanna tell you “well no of course not, I’m not angry all the time” but I am. Whatever you see on my face and whatever you hear come out of my mouth, no matter how normal or happy it might sound or feel right underneath it is just this desire to explode on someone. I wanna hurt, I want to fight someone everyday and that’s what scares me. That’s a big part of why I miss the Dojo, and why seeing Sensei the other night made it so much harder. And I don’t want you to think of me appear just angry stalking around with a scowl on just looking for a fight. 100% of the time I come off as just a normal happy Zak. I’m just giving you a little peek inside which I’ve never done before. But just remember you guys gave me the perfect childhood, you taught me to say I love you all the time and that hugs and are good all the time and we did so many wonderful amazing things that honestly shape who I am far more than anything we just talked about. I love guys so much. And I hope I haven’t hurt you with my words, you asking and I figured I’d tell you honestly ❤️",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49427906}"
2021-09-20 10:20:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/prvvev/how_my_unprocessed_experiences_led_to_my/,How my unprocessed experiences led to my addictions,"It was my first day of secondary school. It was a big scary school, full of older and tough looking kids. I was an innocent, sheltered and soft boy. On my first day in the playground, which was a concrete space with 3 meter cages all around it, much like a prison yard, an older boy came up to me. Offered out his hand and said welcome to the school. I put my hand out to shake his. He had wrapped a metal safety pin around his finger so that when he shook my hand, the metal stabbed into my palm. His eyes fixed on mine. Even then I knew what to do. Not strong or brave enough to fight him, not stupid enough to show pain or fear. I hid my pain as best I could, pulled my hand away and kept walking.

This is just one experience of many that caused me to build an emotional barrier around myself.

If you’re scared of being hurt, scared of being humiliated, scared of being seen to be vulnerable, what do you do? You copy the behaviour of those that seem strong, those that seem confident.

You remove all emotional expression, all sadness, all pain, all fear, all hurt, all sensitivity and you become stone. You express anger or you express lust. These are your only two options to navigate the world of a young man who is afraid of his surroundings.

All that pain, all that fear, you bottle it up, you don’t let it out past your wall, and it sits there. In the pit of your stomach, churning.

So how do you deal with this? I first used food. Eating made me feel happy, it gave me a high and the more unhealthy it was, the more I over consumed it, the more of a buzz I got. This was my first addiction, or dependence.

Next came video games. Virtual reality that would help me mentally escape a daily reality I hated. I spent hours playing and it didn't matter how much my parents hated it or what they tried to do to take it away from me, I needed it.

Then came Porn. Fleeting and brief sexual highs to get me out of my head and my now daily anxiety and depression. And like an addict, when the high starts wearing off, you have to increase the dosage.

Food, gaming and porn carried me through my early teenage years. And then one day, I smoked a joint. I was scared and anxious about it and knew it was a bigger step across the line. But once that high took hold of me I remember the sweet bliss of it all. For the first time, I was properly taken out of my reality, out of my identity and I felt free. Free of all the shit I was bottling up inside, free of all of the pain and anxiety that had become my entire world.

This was a new level and for the next 5 years I used and abused weed until it drove me crazy. Paranoia, anxiety and psychosis.

At 21 I was an overweight, depressed, dysfunctional college drop out with no prospects, no future and no meaning.

Does any of this sound like you?

I see it all of the time. The people I work with, the young men I help. These problems are common and this story is almost standard these days.

I got out. I changed my life. I created a life based on meaning, discipline, purpose and love.

You can too.

If you want help with this, you want to be pointed in the right direction or you just want a chat, get in touch. I want to create a community where we can help each other and where we can heal each other.

I even refused weed after my first try. 
3 months ago I move to the Netherlands, the drug capital of europe and I'm already taken by the druglife.

I made a real good friend here who I dearly enjoyed being around and trust with all my heart. He's a really good, smart and kind guy with a huge fucking heart. But he's a drug addict. 

He's not a junkie yet. Paying rent and bills and going to work is still prioritized before he touches drugs. But everything else, even grocery money, and nights worth of sleeping is pushed in the background when it comes to free base cocaine. 

I promised myself that I would try my best to save and distract this guy. Become he's distraction clean bro. 
And he promised he would do everything to keep me away from his coke addiction cause he knows how fucked it is and he doesn't want me to do that. 

We both failed. He ended up giving me drugs, I ended up buying them for the both of us on some coke fueled weekends. 

Last time I broke my record when I was high continuously for over 2 days. I got broke until payday (never happened in my life before), thank god 90% of my savings I can't access. 

Now I'm still only in Netherlands for 3 months. It still didn't develop into a proper addiction I need every day. But it's already bad enough that I can't refuse when I see it. 

My friend is in it for 4 years, think I will be able to turn him around? Cause I know I can just tell him to do it when I'm not around and keep it away from my eyes. So I can be saved still. 
But I don't know if I can still help him without professional help.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64473486}"

For the first five or six years, it worked great. I was finally able to concentrate and didn't have to go for runs every few hours just to get through an assignment. I only took it when I really needed to and rarely took it on the weekends. Then things started to change...over time, I started to increase my dosage. Once I reached the max you could be prescribed, I started taking just a little extra here and there when things got really crazy both at work and in my personal life. Before I knew it, I was completely addicted and always needing more and more. The last four to five years have been hell. I don't know how I am even alive. I'm 5'4, 105 Ibs and will take on average 120-140 mg a day, but have taken up to (and maybe even over) 300 mg.

I am so tired of it controlling my life. No matter what happens in my life though, I keep doing the same thing. I finally got a new job after losing my job to Covid over a year and a half ago. I had over a year to get better and look for a job, and honestly, I could not even tell you what I wasted my time doing this past year and half. I am so disappointed and frustrated with myself that I had so much time and all the resources and help available to me to change and didn’t do a damn thing. I've had friends, boyfriend and roommates all try their best and go out of their way to help me, and I still manage to keep fucking it all up.

I am finally working again but can barely form a functional thought. And the anxiety of running out of adderall (which is inevitable) is killing me. When I run out, I can’t even lift my head up; I sleep for a minimum of four days straight, only getting out of bed for the necessities. After four days, I go from sleeping all day and night to being able to sit up and watch TV for a few hours each day. How am I going to go work at a new job when I can’t even sit up? I’ve tried talking to my doctor about it, but I don’t have the balls to tell him exactly what I’m doing because I can’t bare the thought of having my adderall suddenly cut off. I just wish I would’ve dealt with this during all my free time this past year, but now here I am, and I’m just so tired of dealing with it all. It has just been a non-stop battle, and I can’t keep doing this.

I'm currently on 2.4mg of Subutex daily and reducing monthly, I started on 24mg and I feel fine.

I've tried to go cold turkey but due to the long half-life of buprenorphine, I was feeling the withdrawals weeks after my last dose.

My plan is to, when I get to a low enough dose of bupe, switch to another opiate with a short half-life so the withdrawals don't last as long and so I get through them quicker. I plan to do this when I'm on less than 0.4 mg of bupe, although I plan to go even lower than 0.4mg of bupe.

My question is which opiate should I switch to with a short half-life and with the least intense withdrawals. I don't mind what opiate it is as long as it fits the criteria of having a short half-life.

If you could provide multiple options just in case one of them isn't available to me at the time that would be great.

The grief has been overwhelmingly complicated as he was an alcoholic that had left us estranged for the past six years. I am feeling a lot of guilt and regret along with his death as there are many things left unsaid, however I think the biggest one for me was our last conversation when I was 18-years-old. We had agreed to meet up for coffee after I had distanced myself from him for constantly disappointing me and not being the good dad I had grown up with. 

Growing up, there were times where he promised to bring me somewhere for my birthday and then never showed up, times where I would spend hours as a kid printing out rehabs for him to go to. It was very painful.  

After our talk I left feeling as if he hadn’t changed. He texted me shortly afterwards saying it was great to see me and that he was looking forward to seeing me again, but I ignored his message and continued to ignore the few ones he sent after, and that was the last interaction I had with him before his death. 

I have spoken to a counsellor who said this was the best decision for me as he would have damaged the relationship further if he wasn’t getting help. They also said that he loved us but didn’t know how to be in our lives. 

I guess what I’m trying to get at is - is there any recovering alcoholic or perhaps children of alcoholics who can relate to this and offer some wisdom? It’s just so hard to get my head around. Was I right to back away from the relationship? I always hoped he would get help and he would reach out again but he never did before he died - is that normal?

I know certain stats on the internet say soda is a valid and dangerous addiction but it just doesn't feel so. Partly why I never really reached out and kept it under wraps for so long - I guess there's a stigma that it's stupid or child-like to have a soda addiction.

All their numbers I ever had are dead by now and back then I never even thought about asking for any more info. Any mutual ""acquaintances"" have mostly disappeared too since then and the few I've found when I was back said they don't know, or didn't remember. His chosen nickname was super common which makes things harder.

I just want to know if they're okay, if they're still alive, or if they're in jail, if I could visit them. I wish I could see them once more. It might sound ridiculous but my heart aches and all these years I've been thinking about these two again and again.

The only things I remember are:

\- their first names & rough age range, his previous profession

\- I reconstructed the rough address of where they/her mum lived, I've been there once. It's a tiny, sheltered, well off village, everybody knows each other, far away from the streets they used to hang out at. I was thinking about going there and hopefully finding her mum (doesn't know me) and ask about them, or maybe ask a neighbor. But regarding their circumstances, this might be a horrible idea. My guess is, if her mum even still lives there, she has most likely already suffered though enough and wouldn't want any ""junkie friends"" from forever ago showing up at her doorstep, selfishly asking for her troubled daughters whereabouts. But it's like the only real lead I have.

My moral compas is sometimes messed up so please someone tell me if this is an awful idea, or if it's an okay thing to do.. I guess jails or other instutitions wouldn't give out information even *if* I had a surname or any more info..

So my ex is addicted to crack and has some sever mental health issues where she tends to use drugs and alcohol to cope rather than her medication and skills. 

Long story short, I finally threw her out a few months ago after I caught her selling my stuff out of my house again (she has her own apartment). Throwing her out resulted in her attacking me, I filed charges and have a no contact order…. 

Haven’t heard from her since. 

So since I kicked her out she’s been using pretty much non stop, has had drug tests come up positive for cocaine (crack is her drug of choice). She was in detox for a week and was released Friday. Keep in mind I’ve literally seen her go to detox at least a dozen times in the last 3 years including 2 stints in rehab. Where she continued to use in rehab. 

So in the last few weeks my ex has been trying to get the no contact order adjusted to have her mother contact me in order to facilitate a visit between my daughter and my ex. 

I did not agree with her being named because they are not open when it comes to being honest with what’s going on with their daughter. They think it’s none of my business what my ex does so long as she’s able to pass a drug test day of the visit and she’s aware during the visit. To me this isn’t enough as they don’t even think it’s important for me to know if she got out of detox or not. They think I’m just out to get her, which I’m not. My concern is my daughter. She’s three and her parents just keep alluding to the idea that it wouldn’t be good for my ex to see her daughter in hopes that it will keep her clean and sober. 

I know that it’s a lot to read and may not be the clearest but I’m wondering what all you’re thoughts are on letting my ex who uses crack at least weekly see my daughter. 

Let me know if you need clarification…

Short version:

Ex is a crack addict. I threw her out, she’s still using weekly. 

Hasn’t been in my daughters life at all for the last 3 months. 

Before that she was in and out of my daughters life due to drugs. My daughter has never called her mom. 

My ex’s parents want to facilitate visits between the ex and my daughter who’s 3

They are not open about communicating about my ex’s drug use, medication changes, rehab, detox, detoxing etc…thinking that it has no impact on my daughter

2021-09-19 06:20:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pr5dl6/my_experience_with_relapse_i_was_about_to_give_up/,My Experience with Relapse - I was about to give up,"I’ve been involved in addiction since 2010. I first became clean and sober in 2013. Since then, I have unknowingly relapsed 5 times, around 2 years apart. The shortest time range was 1.5 years. I relapsed 5 months ago and when I realized that I saw that I seem to be relapsing in a pattern of 2 years repeatedly. Knowing how serious and hard I work and persevere each time to get and stay clean, I somehow manage to fail. \*This was a very scary and terrifying thought, processing the possibility of somehow unconsciously have created a pattern, or maybe it’s just my fate? I sat with this for a long time, and I searched and pondered “why this is happening and what could I be doing wrong? I’m doing everything expected in a sober person. Is there something I’m missing??....”   

I was at the point of accepting the fate of never being able to live a sober life, consider motherhood, and relationship goals no longer an option. Considering the idea that maybe I’m not meant to live sober. God just didn’t intend for me to live that life. And then I realized something that changed my life and blew my mind all at once… **AA meetings**. In my 10+ years of addiction I have not once attended a meeting. I always got sober on my own. Treatment was never a path to sobriety that I chose (mainly from not having the means or insurance to attend). I’ve only learned the tactics needed to achieve sobriety that I was able to teach myself. That seemed to be enough as I was always able to pull myself back to sobriety without fail. Something that treatment centers often advise is continued treatment. Getting sober is one thing but staying sober is something some people need continued support, sometimes their entire lives.

How badly I wish I would’ve learned sooner that living sober doesn’t become instant once entering into a sober life. Sobriety is a lifelong task that has ups and downs and often is forgotten or less of a concern as time goes on. We forget the main thing that every professional treatment center teaches us. Addiction is a disease. Just because we’re not in active addiction doesn’t mean we’re cured. We will always be at risk for relapse and I feel that most of us forget this. Now, there’s plenty of recovering addicts out there who have been sober for 10+ years and have never needed continued support. Props to them. But there’s plenty out there like myself who truly feel that once you’re sober, you’ve made it. Assuming that a sober life is achieved without considering continued support is dangerous and it should be held at the same importance of achieving sobriety. I never considered any type of risk once reaching sobriety… until I faced my 5th round of fighting through the shame and agony of getting sober, knowing that in about 2 years or so my system is going to fail me, once again. 

*I wonder how many other self-treatment addicts aren’t aware of some of the core lessons widely taught in centers. How many others are continuously relapsing? And I hate to even consider this but how many addicts of either treatment have given up on being sober because they can’t seem to stop from relapsing and feel hopeless in staying sober long enough to have a real life? I have a friend who is a current user with no intention of ever getting clean. That’s what he’s accepted as his reality. According to professionals 40-60% of addicts experience relapse. Continued treatment (for me, I’m going until the day I die), needs to be more continuously referred, a standard practice taught in every center, and simply just more widely praised in general because I think there’s so many of us out there that think once we’ve kicked addiction we’ve won. But the fight is just beginning. I very highly doubt that I will ever relapse now with this new tool I’ve found, but if I do it won’t be because I didn’t continue immersing myself in the treatment that got me there in the first place. If you find this advise compelling, you should do as well.*

I mean what if we’re all just addicted to whatever substance and have been conditioned to believe that we have this “disease?” We’re constantly told we’re addicts, constantly repeating out loud and to ourselves “I’m an addict.” After long enough, we start to believe this preconceived notion that we have some flaw that makes us unable to consume any substance in any form.

Is it not possible, if not plausible that we’re just individuals who were stuck in a cycle of using and can escape from it to live as a normal individual after disposing of this belief?

I literally was about to go to rehab, and I went on fb one day and saw a post in my town for someone needing a foster home for a new born kitten. i’ve never had a cat before, i’m a dog person. and I live alone, but no one was stepping up so I said i’d take her. 

being up every 2 hours to bottle feed her was exhausting, but oh my god I should’ve done it sooner. the withdrawals are still not great but I went a solid 3-4 weeks of cold turkey with the xanax because I literally had to be up to feed the kitten or it would die. 

now i’m keeping the kitten, and I don’t have insomnia problems anymore. everyone was being so mean to me saying I shouldn’t have taken the cat, I didn’t think it through, it was irresponsible etc, but my dedication to an orphan kitten really was the only thing that could’ve helped me stop myself without being forced and doing it voluntarily with no distraction.

He came home and he started using again. He's not hiding it as well. I'm trying not to be dramatic with him but also every time I find paraphernalia i get so upset with him. Then he gets upset at me for being an ass, and maybe he's right. I tried working with Familys anon. but its mostly parents and the dynamics of a relationship are far different. So I don't feel like I'm getting any real support. I thought one really great tenet of theirs was to try not to be controlling, but sheeeesh! I'm having such a hard time with that! I feel like I'm just making it worse.

He tells me he's trying to get clean but forever he was just using meth and now he's on to heroin. I feel like we are moving in the wrong direction! For a few days everything will be great, he tells me he's getting clean then I see he's pulling a lot of cash out at ATMs and then I find shit around the house. It's the lying that just hurts so bad. If he's honest with me I can handle it, but its the lying that fucks me right up.

So last month I went to this detox (I don’t have private insurance so they cut me a deal). I am allergic to buprenorphine and usually use methadone to taper. This place didn’t use methadone, used oxycodone. Called me and stated they “safely weaned people off of 150mg of methadone a day” so my fentanyl issue shouldn’t be a problem.

I lasted about two weeks. For over a week, I couldn’t hold down food or drink. I begged them to get me to the hospital. They refused, said my vitals were “fine”. Had to threaten to walk out and flag down a police officer to get service. Still no help. Finally one of their night nurses (one of the few competent ones there) emailed the CEO etc., and the next day they got me to a hospital. Made me sign a document that they wouldn’t even let me read (it was on another nurses cell phone) before they’d provide transport. Literally deadass would not let me read it, and when it was printed would not let me hold it to read it. 

At the hospital I told the nurse “do not send me back, I literally do not feel safe there”. Diagnosed with a bad kidney infection and no potassium and a few other things due to the week of not holding down food or water. Nurse sent me back. Facility threatened to 302 me because I couldn’t eat because they refused to provide food that I could eat (have crohn’s plus some other dietary restrictions due to genetics; NEVER had any history of an eating disorder). Literally had to ARGUE with the staff for over a day - while literally barely able to move - was literally fucking CONVULSING - to let me leave (they kept giving me shit about wanting to AMA). On the trip home, the train operator asked if we needed to stop the train to get me help twice because I kept convulsing so badly.

Pretty telling that the doctor I kept trying to speak to at this place essentially didn’t have a fuckin minute for me the whole two ish weeks I was there, but man when I was finally ready to AMA, doc had ALL the time in the world to sit with me to ask if there was “anything else they could do for me” (ie probably afraid I would lawyer up).

I literally don’t know what to fucking do anymore. 

I have shitty state insurance and they don’t work on weekends, so while you can get “assessed” on weekends, you actually end up waiting over 24 hours to get placed. It’s been a whole mess.

What I am looking for (and what apparently doesn’t exist unless you have $50k copays) is likely a 3.7 ASAM NTP or above, that does a 12-14 day methadone taper. Not that I expect anyone to know of any, I’m just ranting. I am legitimately going to try to get help for one more week and then I am done.

I'm tired of feeling tired all the time, I need some kind of guidance/help in my life.  For the past probably 3-4 years I have been a daily drinker, weekdays I will have 1-2 beers when I get home from work, then that goes straight into whiskey cocktails, I will drink half of a fifth of whiskey at least most nights along with the beer or two. Weekends aren't better at all, it usually starts with at least a 6 pack then it goes right into the whiskey until I get drunk and go to bed just to regret it in the morning. Secondly, I currently dip (chewing tobacco) one can a day which I've done for the past 10 years (it sounds so crazy typing that out finally and seeing how long its been) this is something that I have to stop. I have successfully gone a week without it a few times over the past year but the cravings get the best of me and I'll end up right where I started. I know at some point I've got to have the willpower to just give it up but it always brings me back. Lastly, I've got some weight to lose, I feel disgusted with myself, clothes don't fit well and I keep trying to wear my same clothes thinking that their fine and when I look at myself in the mirror I feel horrible. I only get 5-6 hours of sleep on a good night staying up late drinking, and when I wake up I feel horrible, I have to have multiple cups of coffee or energy drinks and I still feel tired all the time. I've seen myself go from happy and energetic to down and lethargic the past few years, I'm sick of it I need a change I can't stop living like this because I know it won't lead me to a full lengthy life.

This is my first time posting on reddit so I’m gonna try and be straight to the point. I’m a sophomore in college right now and am apart of greek life and have a good group of friends that I have a great time with. However, the school and greek life here are pretty big into doing cocaine.  Freshman year first semester I did a good job of staying away from coke and mostly drank, smoked weed, took mushrooms and things of that nature. Second semester I began to do it more frequently and at the end of the year I found myself doing it probably once or twice a weekend. Fast forward to this year and it seems like anytime I drink I very much want to do coke, and as soon as I do I want more, as it usually goes. Most of my friends are in the same boat in terms of use, however the hours/days after a night of doing a good amount I feel like absolute shit, Full of anxiety and pretty depressed. It’s not the end of the world, but I have more fun and feel more “genuine” when I just drink. I’ve read that I should stop drinking for a little bit, however that’s pretty tricky considering the social situations I find myself in. I doubt there’s a quick fix, but I was wondering if anyone has found any tips or tricks while drunk to kill my urge to use. Nothing bad about people who do blow, lots of fun when done on special occasions, but doing that shit any time I’m drunk makes me feel like garbage and I feel like I’m inhibiting my college experience.

Started playing ""the choking game"" as a kid, 4th grade maybe. It's where we squeeze each other's neck, depriving the brain of oxygen (usually causing loss of consciousness) and an extreme sense of euphoria when you come to. I learned how to do this myself, without anyone elses help and very quickly found myself choking EVERYWHERE. Sometimes passing out, sometimes just momentarily losing my ability to speak or think coherent thought (like a frozen mime). People started to talk, make fun of me. ""The kid that's always got his hands on his neck"" This went on for 11 years (taking a noticeable toll on memory and overall mental capacity, developed a stutter, shakes) until I finally quit. Told myself I couldn't choke before bed, and it worked for about a year until I thought ""well I already quit, I could do it one time"" 

We all know how that plays out. 

Fast forward 3 years of the same bs (about 9months ago) I decided to quit again for good. I find myself touching my neck a lot, pinching even- but no squeezing, so that's good. I still have urges everyday, especially after something stressful happens. But I'm holding 9 months strong, I've noticed my stutter get better consistently, but I still shake and twitch a little. I think that's here to stay. At any rate, it feels amazing to be sober, and able to speak full sentences at all times. Anytime I feel down I think about that zombie state I was in for 14 years, operating without full control of my brain. Never Again

Then when we got older I turned to reading, which turned to trying to find books online, which turned to finding about fanfiction. 

I love fanfiction. 

There's so much of it, and it spans from shitty amateur works to great pieces that realistically deal with internal and external conflict from abuse, mental illness, homosexuality, and self love that I would personally call great works of literature, amd I'll always be grateful for the healing it has given me.

Unfortunately what was originally a coping mechanism has turned into an addiction, and has taken over everything. I now spend my entire day just staring at my screen reading. From when I wake up, while I'm eating, while I'm in classes.

I have PTSD, GAD, MDD, OCD, panic disorder, cyclothymia, an attachment disorder, and a substance abuse disorder. My life is an emotional minefield. I spent my first several years in an orphanage, experienced a ton of abuse and neglect that made it nearly impossible for me to love/receive love as an adult. 

Because of that, I haven’t been able to fully let go of a toxic relationship. Despite loving family and wonderful friends, being with this man is the only way I’m able to experience love that isn’t excruciating due to cognitive dissonance, shame, etc. but we due to both of our histories of abuse, it’s virtually impossible for us to love each other healthily. I don’t believe we can ever stay together, but god I LOVE THIS MAN. I no longer believe I can break the addiction and I’m not sure I even want to anymore.

I’m going to spend my last days with him. I’m going to book us an expensive hotel, we’ll have mind-blowing sex, talk about everything for hours the way we used to, I’ll take us to restaurants I wouldn’t otherwise think I could afford, and I’ll buy a ton of food/supplies for every homeless person I see. It’ll be short enough that things won’t become volatile, and I can have that honeymoon phase one last time. 

Then, after he leaves, I’m going to buy myself one last glass of Pinot Grigio, have an interesting conversation with a stranger at a bar, and jump off a skyscraper and die in my favorite city. I’m so excited.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.44487476}"

He has played it since middle school but it was never bad until after high school. He used to be an outgoing kid, played sports, went out a lot. But since then it’s like the game and these cult like people he plays with have taken control of him. He will stay up and play from 7pm until 6am then sleep all day. He refuses to work and any job he has had he will work there for a week then stop showing up and quit. This has happened at about 18 places I have helped him get hired at. 

I know many may mention therapy, believe me we’ve tried it multiple times. I’ve gone through the process of setting up appointments for him and then he will just not show up or call and cancel it. 

I believe I gave my son a good life and opportunities to advance himself and become somebody but instead he sits in his room 24 hours a day, only coming out to shower (he will take a 1 minute shower) and to sneak downstairs after everyone is asleep to get food. 

Mind you we have never made him pay rent, I wash and fold his clothes, cook for him and leave a dish in the fridge every night, and even pay his phone bill. Not to mention he has no car, car insurance and will soon have no health insurance.

I’ve gotten to the point where I’ve had enough and my husband took his laptop and computer out of the room and put it into a safe. To give you an idea of just how addicted he is, about a month ago I went to login to my laptop only to find there was no longer a password. It turns out he broke into my office one night and took my laptop, reset it to factory settings and played this stupid RuneScape game on it after I went to bed. No care that all my programs, documents, pictures were completely wiped away forever. That’s when we started to realize just how sick mentally he has become.

He has not spoken to myself, husband or two other sons in months. It has become apparent that he is legitimately addicted to this online game. It’s like the only thing he is living for is to play the game and doesn’t care about anything else in life, or his family. 

Along with all of this addiction I really believe he is being manipulated by this group of people he plays with. He has no job or money but received the stimulus money from the pandemic. About 4 months ago he texted my husband and asked if he could borrow $20 for a haircut. When my husband told him to use the stimulus money he had received he went on to tell my husband he “invested” it. After pressing him to find out where this money went it became apparent that he either gave this money away or spent it on this online game as he has no car to go buy things and packages never came to my house.

The worst part is in 2 months he is going to receive an inheritance as a beneficiary on a will as part of an estate his uncle left to his nieces and nephews. It pains me to know that this money will be squandered.

The last two years has been very bad and has taken a toll on my family as a whole. It’s as if a stranger is living in our house. If anyone has advice I would sincerely appreciate.",85,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6190148}"

It's gotten to the point, today, he's been in hospital a little while as he doesn't have enough for nangs, so now he's using butane. We've been told that if doesn't stop, he will either die or become a quadriplegic. Doctors have never seen someone use so much. And apparently he doesn't care, he wants it, and he doesn't care even if it kills him. The doctors believe if he continues to use after he is released tomorrow, he will die, within weeks, maybe months.

I moved back to my hometown when my dad died in Feb and immediately relapsed after 8 months clean time. Somehow pulled myself out of it and was clean for a few months until 2 months ago when I relapsed again. I'm now 8 days clean again. Yesterday my lawyer called and said I had court on Thursday and the threat of jail is very real. I automatically wanted to get so high. But I didn't. Instead I had an hour long video call with my 7 yr old son. He is in Alabama,I'm in TN. People tell me all the time that my son should be enough to keep me sober. But I assure you it's not a lack of love for him that makes me want to get high. I guess I just need to know that I'm not alone in this struggle. I turned 40 a cpl of months ago and I dont want to think that life is always going to be so fucked up. Tommorow I will walk in front of  judge that has the power to sentence me to 40 years.

I recently quit some substances and some destructive behaviours as well.

(Alcohol, caffeine, acting on sexual compulsions, movies/TV, music)

What keeps happening is that I have a craving and it keeps getting worse and I talk myself out of using or acting out.

Then, suddenly, the craving subsides and I feel emotional anguish. But it’s not random emotional pain. It’s tied to things I’ve experienced in the past. Painful memories, parts of myself I’m repressing, truths about life I’ve been ignoring, the reality of my place in life…that kind of stuff.

So the pattern is that I get a craving, then I don’t act on it, then I end up emotionally distressed until I start crying and I just keep crying until I can’t handle crying anymore because I’m sick of it. Then I feel okay for a bit but then the cycle starts up again.

It feels kind of therapeutic. I think I’ve been constantly drinking, having dangerous sex, distracting myself with TV or whatever else and it’s prevented me from actually experiencing my own suffering and moving through it and past it.

I’ve been holding onto things and now I keep painfully letting go of one thing at a time.

It feels like, now that I’m not doing any of the above things to avoid the present moment, I have to feel all the pain I was avoiding all at once.

I haven’t had an easy life and there is a lot of pain.

I’m actually a bit worried. I feel like there might be something else wrong with me causing me to experience this? Or is this possibly a common issue which just isn’t often spoken about? I found a lot of literature on cravings and physical addiction. But I haven’t found any literature or even an anecdote of anyone else going through this?

Also, I have been making sure to do nothing to distract myself from bad emotions as well. I’m just letting myself feel them.

I do have a sneaking suspicion that I might be going through a much needed narcissistic collapse as well. Which I have been delaying for decades with substances and entertainment. At least that’s one possible theory.

Edit: maybe narcissistic collapse isn’t the right word but maybe I have/had a bad case of codependency? IDK

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice? Particularly on if this is a normal withdrawal occurrence or if something else is wrong?

I also want to add that since this started my anxiety is surprisingly at an all time low. My social anxiety has completely disappeared. And in between these strong bouts of emotion I’m actually having fun exploring the city I just ended up in and I’ve been getting plenty of exercise too. So I don’t feel depressed or anxious.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75542796}"

No car, no license, no phone. But I put myself through drivers education, I am willing to walk to work. And god, it just feels great. To live and just be normal. There was points where I would literally not shower for 14 days. Sorry for ranting but god, I am just so proud of myself. My town was hit with meth pretty hard so I am often lonely since all my friends are addicts. So just need a place to rant.

Now I am a teenager now, I was hanging out with some of my classmates this afternoon and most of them are heavy vapers, now me being me I didn't want to seem rude by just leaving the area where they were vaping, so I stayed. Now it has been a couple of hours and I am starting to get cravings, I don't know what to do, at the same time I don't want to tell my parents because I fear they will go to the school and complain.

2021-09-14 13:34:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/po7ilr/benzo_addiction/,benzo addiction,"Hello this problem does not concern me, but a very close person.  

It all started when K. went to a psychiatrist with a problem of social anxiety. He was stressed by public appearances, eg at university, oral exams , etc. In general, his symptoms allowed him to live somehow - he just turned red and sweated a lot. However, he decided that he wanted to ""do something about it"". He received an antidepressant (Venlafaxine) from a psychiatrist, which he is currently taking at a dose of 300 mg / day and Pregabalin (currently 300mg/day). He was taking Benzodiazepines from the very beginning of the treatment, first Alprazolamum and he increased doses, now Lorazepamum also continuously increasing doses. Along the way, he had an ""experiment"" with Alpra  and Diazepam (he took both drugs at once, it ended - fortunately - only with extreme drowsiness, disturbed balance, gibberish and pissing in his sleep). Since the beginning of pharmacotherapy, he has started to use benzo more and more often, not only in situations that really justify taking it (e.g. presentation in a classroom), but also in such normal stresses of everyday life as, for example, talking to the manager at work, talking to his parents about the money, meeting a friend he haven't seen for a long time. 

He must always have his benzo on hand ""at the ready"".  His life has become terrible: he stopped caring about anything, he is late everywhere, he does not embrace his life, he forgets about appointments, procrastination has exceeded all acceptable dimensions. In addition, there are absurd financial decisions made after taking benzo: shopping ""on credit"", then begging parents to pay for these, for example for books worth \~1000$(!) K. lies to everyone, swears that he did not take benzo, even though it shows and we have clear evidence, because another package has disappeared from the cabinet. He also has a huge stockpile of drugs, which we hid from him with his consent a week ago. Unfortunately, nothing can prevent him from the next visit to the doctor on the Internet and the next purchase of benzo. He showed me his patient's account, where you can see all the prescriptions issued, and so far he hasn't bought anything for 3 weeks. 

It's been 1.5 years since the first visit to a psychiatrist, so I know it is quite short, but the addiction is evident. K. started taking benzo ""for a while"", ""just in case"" ... I don't have the strength to help him anymore, often attempts of my help to make him aware of the problem end with a quarrel ""I haven't used it for a week"", ""but the fact that I mumble a little. it does not hurt anyone ""etc. Moreover, I must mention that I came to the conclusion about his addiction quite recently, because everything started to come together - sleeping for days, gibbering, staggering, no emotions whatsoever. Throughout this entire period, when I was not aware of the addiction, I helped him to grasp the things that he had stopped managing - I kept all the important dates, sometimes even did him in his duties, hid him from friends or family. Maybe this behavior only confirmed him that you can function well in such a state?  

K. also goes to psychotherapy (unfortunately he decided to do it quite recently, I think he was already addicted to benzo then). It was his psychotherapist who referred him to another psychiatrist (addiction specialist) who recommended him to go to rehab (specifically at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital - Detoxification Department for Drug Addicts). However, I am afraid that the hospital conditions will not help him, that he will want to return to the euphoric state as soon as possible after he leaves.  

What do you think seems the most sensible solution and what should I, as one of his closest people, and his other friends do? How do you go about it so that he understands it? And what is the path of help in such a situation.  

P.S. I am the most angry with this psychiatrist ..... She has been prescribing him benzo every month for 1.5 years, not seeing any problem with it.

This is my first post on Reddit, so I wanted to make it a happy one, especially within a community that can always use a little dose of positivity :) So I hope I am posting this right and this is an appropriate post for here!  
I have been sober for just about 3.5 years now, and I hold my sobriety as well as the recovery community extremely close to my heart. I am blessed to have a very supportive family, which I know is not always the case for addicts and so I am extremely grateful for it.   
My dad is the type to never wear his emotions on his sleeve really, so he doesn't often outwardly express nor speak much on his thoughts or feelings. Instead, he will occasionally do little things to show he cares, like leave a pastry by the coffee maker or go do an oil change on my car or something.   
Ever since I returned from rehab, he has kept count of how many months sober I am from the date of my sobriety on the whiteboard calendar on our fridge. Even when I was away at school getting my second degree, he would keep the count going, and every time I came home I would see a new count of the 7th of every month.

He has kept this up for 3+ years now every month without fail. At this point in my sobriety, I don't even keep that close of a count, but he does! I am so grateful for this little reminder, and it reminds me every day that he is proud of me, and that I should be too.

A little bit about our Reddit host in her own words: 

""In 2003, I found myself surrounded by friends and family who came to tell me they were worried about my cocaine use. I had changed: I was irresponsible, unreliable, and absent. When I look back now, the word I always think of is “drowning”. Yet somehow, the fear of change was less than the fear staying the same. 

I was admitted to treatment shortly after and my road to recovery began. Once I graduated, I knew I wanted to give back. So I began volunteering at a Toronto treatment centre. Seventeen years later, I’ve had experience dealing with process addictions (i.e. gambling, eating disorders, sex addictions, PTSD) and substance addictions. I’ve lectured at universities and in communities across Ontario. The ongoing problem of addiction and recidivism in jails lead me to write and facilitate a recovery program pro-bono for clients at Ontario Correctional Institute. In 2017, I was elected to the Renascent Foundation Board of Directors, where I advise on CPQ (client programming quality), business development, and fund-raising initiatives. 

I also have two Great Danes because I’m not allowed to have horses in the city. 

I have gone from addict to sitting on the board of director at one of Canada’s leading  non-profit treatment centres for 50 years. To anyone reading this struggling with addiction or know someone who is, it is never too late to recover. Addiction is a disease. Having it is not your fault, But treatment is your responsibility. 

September is National Recovery Month, so I’m more than happy to answer questions about how addictions are formed, how to identify signs of struggle, crisis management, how to find help in your community or within your peer group, and how to tell others that you need help.

But of course, you may ask me anything!""

Is it the addicts on the streets? Trapped in an endless circle of depression, self-pity and overwhelming feelings of worthlessness. Continualiously spinning round and round thru the revolving door of jail, probation, and  a system flawed since it's very beginning. The Never Ending War on Drugs. Like prohibition before it, doomed for failure simply because of our misplaced resources towards the real problem, mental health. With my own inside view of this I have learned that, in most cases, it is not the NORMAL persons life ambition to be an addict when they grow up. I too fell into this trap of finding the easier way to not deal with my difficult emotions by knumbing myself with every drug I could find. I am definitely not trying to place any blame on my surroundings or up bringing for my over 20 years of poor choices and personal short comings. I am my own addict and I have to deal with what I've done and try to understand it for what it is as it relates to me, personally. But after 5 times in county jail I have come to the relazation that so many addicts, never even had a chance at all. As I sit here in my 2nd rehab I'm lost. What did I do to deserve this second chance? And why can't everybody suffering from addiction get this opportunity? 

All I can think of, at the moment, is that it's my fault. I see these injustices in jail, in our society, where those in privalage stay in privalage, and those with not, remain with not. Why do we continue to invest millions in punishing people with a real disease instead of redirecting those resources into treatment. Why do we continue to build new jail's rather than converting them into sober living environments where we can begin to help rebuild lives for the betterment of all humanity. Why do we allow our law makers (the REAL Criminals) to Privatise our corrections systems and trap our brothers, our sisters, our daughters, our sons, our neighbors our friends in this Revolving Door system of punishment rather than Treatment. I'm sorry if anyone who reads this gets offended by anything I wrote. In mad at myself and am just venting. I'm not calling all Law Makers Criminal. And ofcourse not all addicts want help. I guess all I'm trying to say here is.....shouldn't we at least try something new. I feel like there are so many people out there fighting an inner battle for their lives against a disease that I personally feel society just wants to sweep under the rug and pretend like these people, my friends, my family, my neighbors, my loved ones are losing the battle and dying by the hundreds and thousands and meanwhile business is booming at our local jail's and prisons. Personally, I can no longer pretend like this isn't the most dangerous epidemic our country has ever seen, and that's why I have to speak. I'm not saying my viewpoint is right, or wrong. But I am saying we all need to start talking about this!

Because of covid I had to move back with my parents and so I only got to meet him in January. He was out for about a month then and doing really well. Around June, he told me that he had started having violent panic attacks around February, and even tried to kill himself one time. We have been together for four years now, friends for five, and there is nothing that we do not share. I had my own share of mental health struggles (not addiction) in the past two years, and after that he convinced himself that he would not burden me with his addiction. In July, he told me he relapsed and did cocaine once. I was still living with my parents, and the covid situation in my country was such that it was impossible for us to meet. He also lives with his parents, with whom his relationship is strenuous to say the least. He was diagnosed with ADHD after rehab, a fact that his parents think is unrelated to his addiction, which they think is only a result of bad company. 

We finally got to meet last month, spent a few good days, but towards the end of my visit I knew something was off. He was really stressed about this upcoming job interview, and a couple days after I got back he again had a bad panic attack. Soon, he started abusing benzos and alcohol. Within a day, he came clean to his parents and sought help. They checked him into a facility and told me not to tell any of his friends. He is supposed to get out in a week (after about 15 days stay). Considering how his last rehab went, which was also planned by his parents, I don't know what to think. Last time I spoke to him, he drunkenly told me that I don't understand what he is going through. And I know that I don't but would really hope to.

After all, for a lot of my classmates, the teacher leading us to the computer lab every Thursday afternoon was just a chance for them to play computer games during school. My 8th Spanish teacher, who I shall call Mrs. B-A, had a tendency to play favorites, and she very much favored me and my best friend, for we were always on task and not distracted by the temptations of a computer.

Maybe it was this admiration she had in me that motivated me to start using Duolingo outside of the normal Thursday afternoon sessions. Or maybe it’s simply because I straight up became addicted.

I still don’t think I ever really got enough of the “da-ding” sound that filled my ears with ecstasy whenever I completed an exercise. Or of the sound at the end of a series of exercises that would ring out triumphantly, as if I had just won gold in the Olympics. Maybe it was the magical nature of these sounds that kept me going. Or maybe it was because of those whimsical sounds that I was addicted.

Fast forward a year, and I was in 9th grade. My Duolingo streak that I worked on every day to keep alive was around 250 straight days at that point. I had recently had a few close calls of not remembering to complete my daily goal before midnight, so I needed to come up with a better strategy so that I wouldn’t lose it. There was no way I would let myself lose the streak. No. Definitely no way.

At that point, having my streak reset to zero would mean losing almost a year’s worth of effort. It would mean losing part of my identity at that point, as I had devoted so much consistent work to reaching such an impressive milestone. Or maybe I just didn’t want the streak to end because I was addicted to watching the orange meter spin around each time I added to my streak.

My friends thought I was a special type of weird for maintaining such a long Duolingo streak, or really, for even having one at all. However, I took pride in blasting my phone volume every time I was doing Duolingo around them because I knew it annoyed them. My favorite part was actually telling them how long my streak had gotten. One of them would usually ask each week, probably because they were waiting for me to admit that it had ended, but I choose to believe that it’s because they were secretly impressed with how devoted I was to it. Devotion…or addiction, I honestly didn’t know my motivation at that point.

This is the part where I should probably admit that it got a little out of hand. I was now in 10th grade, and the free time I had after school was more limited than in past years. I found ways to do Duolingo during lunch, but sometimes I was too busy interacting with my friends during lunch to remember to do it, so I often found other times to do it. I did it during silent reading in English, sneakily angling the book cover just right so that the teacher couldn’t see my phone out. I did it during computer programming while the teacher was on the other side of the room helping other students. Heck, I even did it during PE class in the locker room after changing into my PE uniform because I knew I had to be efficient with my time. That, or I was just obsessed with keeping my streak alive.

It’s kind of funny though, looking back. Most of my classmates, when sneaking their phone, would be playing games like “Clash Royale” or snapchatting their friends, but I was using it to learn a new language. Because of this contrast, I could justify what I was doing, and that only emboldened my addiction to the app.

Finally though, near the end of January of 2019 it all ended. I was on a trip to Disneyland with my school band, and I was having so much fun with my friends that I forgot all about Duolingo. Poof, the next day my streak of almost 800 days was wiped clear, all the way down 0. At first, I thought there had been a mistake because I thought I had bought a “streak freeze”, which does what it sounds like it does for one day, but I realized that I had forgotten to buy it for that day. When reality hit, and I stared at the lifeless, greyed out zero that had taken over the three digit number that used to be proudly displayed in lively orange font across the top, I honestly didn’t know what to do, and all I could do was just stare at it over and over again.

My desperation to get my streak back was so apparent that I even made a last ditch effort and filled out a bug report on Duolingo’s website…I never did hear back. I knew I wasn’t going to start a new streak because I was aware that it would take over two years to build back what I had lost. That thought now signals to me that at that point I had just been doing Duolingo for the sole purpose of maintaining my streak and that’s it. It wasn’t to learn Spanish, or because it was assigned for homework, and it wasn’t even because of the superb sound effects that it offered.

I have to acknowledge that it did help me learn Spanish though. I always breezed through my Spanish classes in high school, and I don’t think I could say the same had I not done Duolingo for seven hundred-something days straight. Eventually, I came to terms with losing my streak, and something that helped forget about it was realizing that I had lost my streak while having too much fun at the ‘Happiest Place on Earth’. So, like at least I didn’t lose it because I was bogged down with chemistry homework, or something lame like that.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43576613}"

She would go to social events like parties and get together with designer brands head to toe. A few weeks ago my family and I realized she’s been acting a little strange but didn’t think much of it. It progressively got worse as she started talking about how the world is fake, tarot cards, and we’re living in the matrix etc etc. she gave my mom and I 2 bottles of pills each and told us it’ll help with our energy and focus. We both put it to the side not thinking much of it until today. She was nowhere to be found for over 24 hours until we received a call from the hospital saying she was in psychiatric emergency. We went to her apartment to make sure her dog was safe and found nothing else . All her designer clothes, bags, jewelry, anything with value was gone. She said she donated all of it because she doesn’t need materialistic things. The doctor said she was on shrooms as she was terrorizing her neighborhood and I immediately thought about the “vitamins”. It was called “choq 7 wonders of the world” and “choq shilajit”. I did some research and found ties to the Instagram page @evolvingknowledge. Everything about it seems off and giving cult vibes. She’s been taking shrooms at least 2 times a day for the past >month and I’m assuming she overdosed from not feeling it anymore. She keeps calling us from the hospital telling us to break her out and there’s nothing we can do about it. This situation is very unsettling for my family and I basically want to know what are these pills? Are there long term effects? Are they addictive after she gets out? Does she need to go to rehab? What can we do to help her? Thank you for reading.

I am a 25 year old and my mother (56) is an alcoholic. My mom recently got out of 30day in-patient treatment and my brother (28) and I decided it would be best if she lived with one of us while taking her journey through recovery. Her previous living conditions were toxic and drove her to start drinking again. As such, she moved into my home.

I set rules such as:
- need to look for a job
- need to find a therapist 
- go to AA meetings 
- be active outside of the house (she is depressed and will sit at home all day)
- no alcohol in the house

My boundary was: as long as she is actively working on her recovery and taking initiative to get better, she can stay with me until she can afford her own apartment.

Her first 2 days out of rehab, I gave her space to get comfortable. After 3 days, I helped her apply for jobs. I ended up applying for her while she barely paid attention.

4 days in, I sat down to help her find a therapist. Same thing. I looked them up, gave her the phone numbers, and had her call with very little help from her.

She did not go to any AA meetings because she felt sick. 

5 days in, I found a bottle of rum in her room and confronted her. I took her car keys. I live in a city with a bus stop right down the street from my home. She made promises to start actively trying to get better.

After 10 days, she continues to sit on my couch and just watch TV. On the 10th day, I told her that she couldn't stay here anymore. I can't sleep and I can feel myself getting physically sick from the stress and worry and my own codependent behaviors that I've worked on started resurfacing with her living with me. 

I need advice: did I not give her enough time? I feel selfish and guilty for kicking her out after 10 days. I can't help but feel bitter that at 25years old, I have the responsibility of caring for a parent already. But shes made me feel like a prisoner in my own home. Adding to this, my dad (55) died 2 years ago after battling with alcohol addiction my entire life. Am I being too hasty in kicking her out already?

I've only this weekend came to the realizatdion that perhaps what I would usually consider to be bad habits, to actually be addiction and perhaps even a broader addictive personality.  The two specific addictions I want to attack is my relationship with food, and my relationship with porn.

I realized when I have positive experiences for my mental health, my addictive traits are being channeled in to positive extremes (e.g. exercise), but when I ""relapse"" I have these big swings and this has been yo-yo'ing now for around 5 years to make me think it might be more than I think.  It certainly is impacting my mental wellbeing.

I also have growing social anxiety with groups (much better 1x1) so I'm not sure I want to meet in person yet (even if available giving the pandemic), but I think if I had others with similar issues in a Zoom setting that would be great.  Preferably first listening only until I felt comfortable to speak up.  

In albeit through TV and Movies, seeing how people do sponsorship and other things in AA, it made me feel like this might be something more I need.  Because nobody knows about either of these issues in my real life and so instead I make light of the situation.

I've only just had the thought to look for this subreddit so I apologize if this isn't really the purpose.  Last night I did a little Googling around for support groups both close to my area (WA), as well as just general, but most seemed to be defunct or not really relevant.

Any tips?

TL;DR

\- Only now for first time in my life (30+) starting to embrace problems as addictions

\- I'd like to be able to join specific groups relevant to by two biggest issues (Food, Porn)

\-Otherwise I'd be open to a more general addiction group/sponsor setting, just not sure how open i'd be able to make myself

\- I'm just wanting people to talk through without judgement, but can also hold me accountable, and hopefully I can help them too

&#x200B;

Outside of this, I promise I'm normally considered quite a decent guy, despite the above sounding pretty bad re; porn and food!

They’ll say stuff like “nobody put a gun to your head and made you take drugs” or “the supply is only there because of the demand” or “addicts chose to be that way”.

Well here’s a couple of points from someone with some intelligence and common sense who has seen a bit of the world:

1. A lot of people who get hooked on drugs were initially introduced to them at a young vulnerable age by older more mature people who they trusted. Famous example: DMX.

2. A lot of people turn to drugs as a desperate attempt to escape pre-existing psychological pain, either from trauma (eg. Domestic abuse) or from undiagnosed mental illness (eg. Bipolar Disorder), and they may not have the support or finances available to get proper treatment.

Honestly, get out there and experience life. Then you might think twice before making such idiotic comments.

I am 27 years old.
I am reaching out for help or advice  
I have just gone through the most fucked up experience of my life 
On September 1s at 12:20 am my fiancee Kevin passed away 
Kevin and I were in recovery putting all our efforts into bettering our lives . It was going very well and we were both very happy until his dad suddenly got very ill and was admitted to the hospital. His health rapidly deteriorated and he was diagnosed with ALS,  

We were clean and in a program in sober living together and  his dad passed away  and he got really depressed and relapsed the other night, our sober living tested him ,he popped  hot , and as much as we all tried to get him to go to detox his mind was already made up  any further would have just pushed him away.  So he left and  I left with him so he wouldn't be by himself  and I made  sure I  brought plenty of narcan  
After a day and a half of babysitting him I dozed off  because I wasn't used to staying up late and I was emotionally exhausted with  the whole situation, and I woke up to him gasping and throwing up all over himself ..  I jumped up  called 911 and got (iidk how long he was in that condition because I was asleep) him on his side so he  wouldn't choke on his puke  and my neighbors at the hotel I was at heard the commotion and came to my door with narcan and started helping me by narcanning him while I gave him  chest compressions and cpr. He puked all over me and kept choking on it when I was trying to get him on his side  being a heavier guy.   by the time the emts were here 20 mins later  we had narcanned him  3 times and I was covered in vomit  from head to toe. They narcanned him another 4 times and it didn't work  but he had vo.mit in his lungs and had a heartattack.  It took longer than it should have but they shocked him back to life in the ambulance.  Got him to the er and had to sedate him and put a tube down his throat and put hum on life support and cool his body into hypothermia to preserve his brain because his heart stopping cut his brain off from oxygen for an extended amount of time 
The  lack of oxygen to his brain has caused it to swelli they said  maybe he would come back so he was on lifesupport for 3 days and just got taken off the other day. 
 I did not want him to be alone with no one to find him or be able to help him but as the days go by and nothing has changed whether I was there or not I really have started to hate that was there 
I can not ever unsee him like  that or any of that experience. 


And I don't know how to go on living with this guilt that I could have done something more or worse what if it was me that killed him.  
This is a stupid question but is there any kind of way I can try to contact him somehow. I am desperate. Thank you.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5204519}"

Me and my mom were having a conversation about hardcore drugs and how she never wants me to try them, no matter what. I was telling her about my ex who was addicted to crank and my mom said she used to snort cocaine when she was in her mid 20s. I laughed it off and told her to stop joking. I truly believed she was. Until she told me that she's not. Then I heard her voice start to shake & crack, and she told me that she's a recovering addict and she' s been sober 4 years. Not to sound cliche, but it shocked me to my core. I found out she used to snort it at parties with my dad and 5 or 6 years ago she used to abuse oxycontin and different types of opioids. Then she told me what Suboxone is for. I never knew what it was for, just assumed that it was for anxiety or depression. I don't judge her for what she did, my grandma fucked her and my uncles up when they were being raised, even attempting to OD in front of my mom, uncles and grandpa, and my 12 year old mom had to pull her hair back to keep her head away from her hand full of pills. Then she handed me her N.A book and told me what all those private zoom calls were about. I figured therapy. It was N.A Zoom calls. Even while i'm typing this I can't stop shaking and I keep having to fix grammar errors because of how fried my brain is. My mom is always the ""loving, sweet, putting everyone else before myself"" Person. She also told me that my dad had to take us for a month so she could go to rehab. She said she can't promise that she wouldn't relapse, but we're in a really good situation now and she hasn't thought about using for a long time, and that if she relapsed, it wouldn't do anything except destroy everything that she worked so hard to accomplish. I don't know what i'm feeling right now. I would never judge her for her use of drugs, because everybody has their reasons for it. Trauma, abuse, stress, anxiety, depression, even human emotion.

Is it losing my job as a Sales Manager making $60,000 annually at just 20 years old? Is it cashing out my 401K because I've burned through every bit of money I had saved? Is it refusing to drive an hour away to say 'bye' to my dad who raised me all by himself before moving to Idaho for an unknown amount of time, possibly indefinitely, in fear of him being able to tell I was dope sick in the morning? Is it pawning the ring I've kept on my finger since I was eight years old (of course resized a few times) handmade by my uncle and gifted by my dad with both of our birthstones with the true intention of getting it out next paycheck, only to get paid and spend it all on more dope), leaving behind that ring willingly in that pawn shop to be melted down, remolded, and sold to someone else? Is it pawning or selling any and all possessions of mine and my husband's that held any value whatsoever for even just one single shot? Is it alienating my entire family because the only thing I was concerned about was my next high? Is it choosing to starve myself because being dope sick sends me straight into animalistic survival mode where getting high is definitely a priority over eating? Is it trading iphones for heroin out of my Sprint store, knowing it will most likely end up in lengthy jail time with charges of grand theft and dealing in stolen property? Is it losing my second opportunity at having my own sprint store in a different state after f****** up the first one? Is it finding out I'm pregnant with my first and only baby boy after wanting to be a mommy my whole life and begging my husband to get me pregnant because SURELY that will get me clean, right?! Is it finding out I have endocarditis at 24 years old and have a 1% chance of surviving because my blood was already septic and more than likely will have to have open heart surgery and if I used again, I would die? No?? How about when I ended up in a nursing home during this time because I needed 6 weeks of IV antibiotics and I'm mistreated because no one there is under 55 years old and here I am once again on the brink of death, trying to heal from IV drug use that nearly killed me? Is it laying in bed, staring into my husband's rare tear-filled eyes telling me he feels like he's watching his wife slowly kill herself right in front of his eyes? Is it having two knee surgeries and three blood transfusions as a direct result of an infection from IV drug use? Is it being evicted from my home at eight months pregnant with nowhere to go because I spent all my money on heroin? Is it using the entire 37 weeks I was pregnant regardless of what the doctor told me could possibly happen? Is it DCF showing up at the hospital, right after I gave birth, and telling me 'I'm sorry but you can't be the one to take your baby home'? Is it the NICU nurse telling me 'I'm sorry baby but if you want to breastfeed, we'll have to get a doctor's order because whatever drugs you did will likely transfer through your milk'? Is it watching my newborn baby withdraw in the NICU due to my selfish drug use and the only way to ease his symptoms was putting him on a Morphine drip (without informing me or getting my consent first because I'm a junkie mom and therefore I've lost the right to make decisions for my child) and then watch them have to ween him off of it? Is it leaving my six week old baby behind to go to rehab for the first time only to run off even further away from my husband and son, relapse, and not complete my program? Is it convincing another addict to get me a $20 bag knowing they were in recovery too, resulting in their relapse and overdose a month later? Is it my little sister telling me she's already accepted that she's gonna bury me? Is it writing out my own obituary including all the names of my loved ones that are gonna be left behind when I overdose and can't be brought back, starting with my son's name? Is it walking a mile to the gas station at eight months pregnant to smoke cigarette butts out of the ash tray because I spent all my money on drugs and couldn't afford the cigarettes I shouldn't be smoking in the first place? Is it being laid up, sicker than h*** every single morning almost for six years that I didn't have a shot to wake up to which was the majority of the time because there was no such thing as me saving a shot for the morning? Is it stealing $60 out of the McDonald's till at a store I managed for one shot, knowing that I was gonna get caught and either charged with petit theft when I have a clean record thus far, or lose the only income that was coming in between my husband and I to support or at least attempt to support our child? Thank you COVID 19 for sparing me from that arrest. Is it being told by a new acquaintance that she doesn't wanna get any closer to me because she doesn't think I'm gonna make it? Is it seeing 'RIP' almost daily on my newsfeed for another one gone too soon? Was it overdosing and dying in my husband's arms and him having to give me full blown CPR to bring me back to life? What about the second time when he had to Narcan me twice? No?! How about when my mother-in-law had to Narcan me? Oh, then AGAIN when my husband had to Narcan me? It had to have been the 5th time I overdosed when my 12 year old niece had to run and find the Narcan in my sister-in-law's bathroom because she was at work and my husband had to again dispense it twice to save my life while his mom waited frantically on the phone with 911 until the ambulance arrived? Is it my in-laws raising and financially supporting my child when it should be me but it isn't because I can't keep a needle out of my arm or hold a job past my first paycheck? Is it finding out that I almost called home for the first time from rehab, to ask for my husband, and be told that he overdosed, because he did, but Thank You JESUS they revived him? Is it letting our 'friend' who was really just a f****** dope dealer, convince us to let him take our dog for a sleepover before we moved, for a shot of heroin, which ended with him kidnapping her and us having to move to Florida without her and never getting to see her again? Thank You again Jesus for getting our baby found and is now staying in a great, loving home with our dear friends until we can hopefully bring her home!!! Is it going to rehab three times??? Is it my son being 27 months old and still not saying 'mommy' or 'mama'? Is it the Department of Children and Families showing up at our front doorstep unannounced because I overdosed the night before yet again and refused to leave until I either gave up my child or found a more suitable home for him because I can't stop getting f****** high - might I add he went to my grandma's house whom I had not spoken to really or reached out to in almost seven years so that he wouldn't go to the state. Is it only being able to afford (or choose to spend dope money on) one single box of diapers in the whole two years my son has been alive? Is it my only child looking for me last for comfort and security because the majority of his life, at least half of it, I haven't been there? Is it kissing my son 'goodnight' and having to leave him in someone else's home because I have been deemed a 'danger' to my child because I relapsed? Is it choosing to do methamphetamine for the first time when I swore that was the one drug I'd never touch no matter what because I was so sick and anything, even meth, was certainly better than nothing? Is it my husband giving me an ultimatum that either I get clean or he can't be with me and my very next question being 'So, you aren't trying to get anything???'. Is it pushing away every single person that cares about me and still loves me regardless of the shit I've put them through? Is it stealing from my mother-in-law again after genuinely, in that moment, telling her that I'd never steal from her again because it really actually hurt seeing the pain in her eyes caused by the disappointment, only to do it again the next morning, and then 'f*** it' why not the next morning when I wake up sick? And 'd***, she still has money AND she's getting paid tomorrow? Okay, so, let's do it again until we get prompted with 'insufficient funds'? Is it making my husband promise to find our son a mommy that will take good care of him when I'm not here anymore because they'd both be better off without me? Is it my childhood friends blocking me because I haven't seen or talked to them in years and I keep asking them for money? Is it looking to my husband for guidance when I'm trying to console my baby because after two years, as his mother, I still haven't quite figured it out yet? Is it reaching for the closest thing I could grab to wipe off the blood, and then realizing it's my baby's T-shirt? Is it gonna be when enough is no longer an option? When we were fresh out of Narcan and I chose to call my dealer for 'just one shot, I swear'? When is enough enough?

2021-09-11 12:55:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pmb064/riskreward/,Risk:Reward,"I've struggled a lot with addiction in my life, mainly marijuana.

One book that always stuck with me is Allen Carr's which is about changing your beliefs and perspective around addiction.  For example: 
“The whole business of smoking is like forcing yourself to wear tight shoes just to get the pleasure of taking them off.” 

Another thought that is not originally my own but that I've recently internalized is risk:reward.  When you're addicted to something or in the initial stages of sobering up, you're honestly not of sound mind or thinking clearly.  So you feel that the reward of taking drugs is super high and that the risk is super low.

------

High reward (10): ""If I smoke this joint, it'll relieve all the stress and problems of my life.  I know I'll feel better instantly.""

Low risk (1): ""It's just one day of getting high, it's not a big deal.  Weed isn't that bad for you, so many people use it.  I still have a job and a place to live, it's not like I'm homeless or addicted to heroin.""

So let's say you were playing poker or making a bet.  Risking 1 to gain 10 is a great bet to place, so of course you'll do it.

Low reward (1): ""Weed doesn't even make me feel good anymore.  I just end up passing out.  I don't feel creative and things aren't super funny like it use to be.""

High risk (10):  ""If I keep heading down this path I don't know how bad things can get.  I'm at an age where I want to get married, I have career goals, I can't rely on my parents financially, so there isn't a safety net.  If I keep getting high and my work productivity keeps decreasing, I might lose my job.  I'm also driving high a lot more, I don't want to end up crashing and hurting someone else or myself and messing up my life.""

Risking 10 to gain 1 makes no sense.  (I'm aware that the % chance or odds of an event occurring also determine whether a risk/reward scenario makes sense, just trying to keep it simple).

Essentially, understand you have a lot to lose by continuing to be addicted and little to gain.  At the same time, you have so much to gain and you're risking and giving up so little to be sober.  Changing your beliefs is difficult.  This is more helpful for once you're already a week or so sober.  Obviously some people's situations are more severe and a bit of mental gymnastics is not enough.  

Good luck folks.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5242092}"

She's quite charming and great at telling stories and I felt very drawn to her because despite that she pretends to be goofy and funny externally, there's something about her that makes you feel like she's slowly suffering inside.

Anyhow, she's told me that as a young child (10+), her mother forced her to take ADHD meds, and now she can't function without them. She's always taking adderall or she needs to be cocaine or amphetamines, and then she smokes a lot of pot or drinks excessive amounts of alcohol to dull the ADHD med effects. Every single day, she is completely high, stoned or on her way to being high.

In addition, when she was a child, her mother had homeschooled her and instead pushed her to become a child model, so she became the cash cow for the entire family, and often received zero to no guidance from her mother. She also has some unresolved trauma, as when she was young, she lived next to some neighborhood boys who were older than her, and they molested her from the time she was 13+.

Suffice to say, as a young child, she suffered a lot and it led her to the current point in time in which she wants to get help for her various addictions. She recently confided that she wants to get into a long-term relationship but that men only ""use"" her for sex. I asked her how many men she slept with in the past year, and the number was astronomically high (<30). Most of these men she slept with on the first date, as they would go to a club or bar and after a couple of drinks, she would find herself kissing them, which would then led to them going directly to the bedroom. In my analysis, I think the fact that she had been molested as a young girl has a lot of effect on her current promiscuity. Those early experiences had essentially molded her to think that the way to attain attention and love from men is solely through sex and this might be something that might be hard to break away from.

We spoke a lot about this in depth, and I mainly listened to her, but she fears being judged so I didn't necessarily tell her my analyses. In the future, she would really like to find a long-term relationship with someone she can love, but I feel at this point in time, she only understands resolving her impulsivity with drugs and sex addiction.

She fears never being enough and wonders why men do not love her? I did tell her that the love you give is the love you tend to receive and asked if she loved herself? And she said she didn't know, there's a part of her in which she is filled with self-hatred and disgust and I think that she wants someone to love her to fill a void inside her. Unfortunately, her mother was not the best role model, gave her little to no guidance, and she had been used to provide for them as a young child, so this is the only model of love that she understands.

Quite frankly, I'm not sure she can break away from her drug and sex addictions, nor do I know if she really wants to, but I think she is lost and needs more help than mentorship. She has also been to many drug rehabilitation centers without much success as she goes back to using when she runs into many of her drug-using friends who enable her.

With my close friends, I usually give them advice or suggest what to do, but I feel like with her, she needs someone to listen to her more than anything else, and I haven't made any suggestions on a plan of action. So I'm wondering, what do you think would be the first step in helping her if she wanted to break free from this cycle that she has been caught up in?

2021-09-10 14:23:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/plqmxw/dependence_my_thoughts/,dependence (my thoughts),"dependence for me is pretty bad. i grew up with a co-dependent abusive relationship with my mum, i had few friends as a child because i *needed* them to be my *only* friend. which, of course, led to me actually pushing them away. i then began a cycle of addiction, i was recovering from anorexia, and i turned to food in that recovery as a source of comfort. and over i kept eating, i tried not do, i hated that i did, but the escape that i got when i mindlessly ate was immense, i could *leave* myself, leave everything. and then my mum died to suicide, and that was a month ago. i decided i need to quit being dependent on things, because i seriously am going over the limit, i'm fairly slim so nobody would assume i have this addiction. 

i know that mental illness and addiction are closely linked. and i know growing up around substance abuse and being exposed to unhealthy co-dependence as a child are factors that could lead to addiction. but what really interests me is the idea of *dependence*. are we *dependent* on anything, really?

to be defined, dependence is the state of relying on or being controlled by someone or something else. having something, but it's inherently *tied* to something else. like getting a dog, and accepting you have to walk it, or a baby animal relying on it's parents for food and safety. and often in addiction, we feel dependent on an external factor. be it drugs, alcohol, food, people, video games, porn, starving yourself or literally *anything*, we think to ourselves- even subconsciously- **i am dependent**. and we have good reason to feel that, mabe you have a medical reason to take something (like some heroin addicts become literally physically dependent on heroin). or maybe you feel sex will take the edge off, and you feel you need that person, or that feeling, to  go on. maybe you feel that hit will stop the flashbacks, the pain of grief, the numbness of depression, the crippling embarassment, regret, just the *pain of the present* . and believe me, *i* know how that feels, *most* of us on here, if not all, know how that feels. it's pain.

i personally suffer from ptsd, and the flashbacks, the pain of the present, is so bad i could collapse, the feelings of inadequacy, that i never did enough, and that nothing will ever be good again feel so severe that in that moment i would do *anything* to escape it. so the cycle goes.

but if i took a look at myself, a good, honest look at myself- what would i think? well, for starters, i am not there, in the past, anymore. the fear i feel is just fear, though it's overwhelming, i'm not inherently connected to it. secondly, do i *want* to take this, or do this, or whatever you're addicted to? normally it's **yes**, i want to to escape, i'm afraid of my feelings, and i'm afraid of never binging again, because who knows what happiness feels like? will i ever be happy again? or will i forever crave, and hate the person i am now? what will my life be like when i'm sober, how on earth will i ever deal with my emotions, i've completely forgotten how. 
but if it's **no**, i ask myself why i feel compelled to. why do i feel like using. i'm not near drugs, i don't even want to. but something inside me is pulling like opposite poles of magnet. i feel like there's so much energy inside me that could be released by a hit, or i feel, again, scared of facing the present, however that may look. or i feel like i'm afraid of the good feelings i feel, because i'm not used to feeling good, when i do, i just want to feel bad. because that's my comfort zone.

and so we move on, to our *comfort zone*, that sneaky little bastard that disguises itself as a holiday. to define comfort zone, a situation where one feels safe or at ease. exactly! *safe or at ease*. we feel *safe* when we're in the midst of using. we feel *at ease* when we're doing an addictive behaviour. sort of like when a compulsion is carried out by an OCD sufferer, we feel like our minds are at ease, like all our problems are put on hold, our thoughts (or lack of) seem so much easier to deal with when we perform the unhealthy habit. interestingly, the *other* definition of comfort zone is,  a settled method of working that requires little effort and yields only barely acceptable results. meaning, we abuse ourselves, because it takes little effort to do so, many of us are insecure, and feel bad about ourselves, so hearing 'drugs are bad for your health! obesity is one of the biggest killers! smoking kills!' holds no threat, most of us pretty much hate ourselves. so nothing feels more important to us in that moment than escaping our feelings.

so what could we do to make it worthwhile to sit **outside of our comfort zone**?  and so, stop the cycle of dependence? well... not to be anticlimactic, but i'm not sure. i guess we have to make it up for ourselves.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64546317}"

Join us (u/RenascentAddictions) and the rest of Reddit on September 14th from 12-3 p.m!

A little bit about our Reddit host in her own words: 

""In 2003, I found myself surrounded by friends and family who came to tell me they were worried about my cocaine use. I had changed: I was irresponsible, unreliable, and absent. When I look back now, the word I always think of is “drowning”. Yet somehow, the fear of change was less than the fear staying the same. 

I was admitted to treatment shortly after and my road to recovery began. Once I graduated, I knew I wanted to give back. So I began volunteering at a Toronto treatment centre. Seventeen years later, I’ve had experience dealing with process addictions (i.e. gambling, eating disorders, sex addictions, PTSD) and substance addictions. I’ve lectured at universities and in communities across Ontario. The ongoing problem of addiction and recidivism in jails lead me to write and facilitate a recovery program pro-bono for clients at Ontario Correctional Institute. In 2017, I was elected to the Renascent Foundation Board of Directors, where I advise on CPQ (client programming quality), business development, and fund-raising initiatives. 

I also have two Great Danes because I’m not allowed to have horses in the city. 

I have gone from addict to sitting on the board of director at one of Canada’s leading  non-profit treatment centres for 50 years. To anyone reading this struggling with addiction or know someone who is, it is never too late to recover. Addiction is a disease. Having it is not your fault, But treatment is your responsibility. 

September is National Recovery Month, so I’m more than happy to answer questions about how addictions are formed, how to identify signs of struggle, crisis management, how to find help in your community or within your peer group, and how to tell others that you need help.

But of course, you may ask me anything!""

2021-09-10 09:32:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pll4aw/do_i_cut_all_ties_with_my_addict_friend_forever/,Do I cut all ties with my addict friend forever?,"I was talking to my counselor about my friend who I have been dealing with for a while trying to help him out in his addiction and she recommends me cutting complete ties without the possibility of allowing him back into my life after he becomes completely sober.  I think I understand the reason but I don't think I can do it.  Granted these last few months have been so turbulent for me, he lies to make he has stolen money (small amount like $30) from me, caused the cops to pull on me, disappeared for days on me without contacting me (I guess the story gets better lol). He's also been a life long addict weed @ 14, moved to heroin at 18, then blues at 22, in and out of recovery, jail a few times.  He is 31 now and only has about 25 months sober at 26y/o, then the next longest are only months sprinkled around. I mean for these reasons I should do what she asks.  Her reasoning is, or as far as I understood what the reasons were is because when I met him, he was an addict so our friendship started of basically as an enabler/addict type of friendship. He lives with me because he became homeless, so basically I provided him with all the creature comforts but he went into a relapse/sober cycle unfortunately. In the last 4 months when I decide, against my better judgement to let him stay at my house, he went into a cycle 3-4 days sober, then 3-4 days using with some week long detoxes at a facility thrown in there (about 4 times).  Now,  He is in a rehab center it is only 45 days he is about 2 weeks in.  I visiting him about when he was 10 days sober (well I guess your not truly ""of sober mind"" until after a few months, PAWS (post acute withdrawal syndrome) that can last for months and what not. He is a great guy (or has the potential to be). My therapist so happens to also be an addiction counselor, I don't do drugs myself, but she says he probably won't ever see me anything more than the person who provides for him, basically always see me as an enabler, someone who he can use because drug addict live in the moment and aren't really capable of planning for the future like a person who never used can.  I know I have become terribly codependent on him but he is the only person who I really formed a bond with.  I don't have a lot of friends so for me to bond with a person who I feel comfortable sharing stuff and enjoy being around is extremely rare. My therapist also feels that I will never have peace in my life because I will question every behavior/action/spoken word in the future even in his sobriety.  So I guess she is doing this from the aspect of my overall mental health.  I mean she is right about the questioning, I over analyze everything.

I don't think I can do it, when I visited him last week he was telling me how homesick he is and can't wait to come back home (my house). He also tells me about all the plans he has when he become sober be a singer (which he's pretty good at) and a personal trainer (which he ran a successful personal training business in his short bout of sobriety). One thing that is always included in the plans is me.    He even asked what my dream car is and how he wants to buy it for me. I told him how I am gonna buy a piece of property about 10-15 acres big enough to build a few homes for some family members and I told him he can have an acre if he wants to  build a property on my land. He loved the idea.  He talks about it often about how excited  he is to be close to me and build a house where he could raise a family on (he wants to get married and have kids) Stuff like that makes me feel amazing (I am not holding my breath though) In a perfect world I would want him to be my best friend forever and have him within yelling distance of where I live. I guess I also live in a dream world, blinded by my loneliness. I loved that he makes plans and always wants me to be in his life. I've been lonely most of my life never really having friends. All I have in my life as far as friends is my childhood friend, but we now live in different states and barely talk to each other and him.  I guess by the stuff he's put me true most would say ""he's not your friend"". I don't know?  I found out that when he talks to other people about me he raves on what an amazing person I am in his life and how much he blessed to have me in his life. I heard about this from a couple people he introduced me to, they tell me ""he talks about you all the time, and what an amazing person you are""  

I don't know, I mean he has treated me like shit often time through his addiction, but its the drugs right?  I mean partially it is true that it is because of the drugs, but I guess I also used it to justify his action and putting me through all this.  Am I being foolish? Blinded by my loneliness allowing him to run roughshod though my life and basically forgiving him for all he's done. As I write this I am starting to think my therapist might be right... My heart is willing to hold on to the tiny infinitesimal sliver of hope that this might be the time he does become sober and everything will get better.  My brain tells me otherwise, that he only has 14 days under his belt of sobriety and relapse can be around the corner and that I could be in this cycle of sober/relapse many years to come and he is only giving me the illusion of friendship. That when he tell me he loves me (not the romantic love) and thinks of me of his brother is just lip service to keep me around. My heart is full of sorrow over all this and the decisions I might have to make. I truly want him around forever, but that could be my loneliness talking.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.50812596}"
2021-09-10 01:35:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/plewo4/just_my_story/,Just my story,"Alcohol has caused my kin and I an immeasurable amount of pain and suffering, even now I am haunted by the transforming shadows of forgotten deeds that I will never truly know. I will forever be the villain in the stories of so many, and from what I hear, for good cause. I've spent a great deal of time attempting to lay these demons to rest so that I may live a happy and fulfilling life. Even now, a voice freshly buried attempts to crawl to the surface as it screams and beckons to me. It wants nothing more then for me to give in to its acrimony of compunction that has long lost any sense of purpose. Evasive, it is, that to simply name it invokes a primoradial sense of discomfort. Say hello to the monster in your closet, shame! I never realized  until much later just how much time and energy I'd spent avoiding this simple yet caustic emotion. I think about how much shame and embarrassment contributed to me returning to the behavior that masqueraded so cleverly as the answer. Now I come to find that this perceived solution was the convoluted function of a variable in a very long equation.

Now, using the lens of newly acquired knowledge, and through the power of hindsight, I am able to finally locate the nexus of my addiction. At some point, I felt such an overwhelming amount of shame that I deemed myself a complete failure. I'd simply used too much white-out and it was no longer hiding my mistakes. At least not in a way I found satisfactory; I wanted to hide the mistakes, but it wasn't for anyone else. I wanted to forget, what I really wanted was to throw the whole paper away. The white-out via black-out method I had employed only worked so long as I overwrote my saved data with even worse data.  What was more was that it only allowed me to feel okay while engaging in the behavior. I simply couldn't cope with the silliest mistakes, due to my now well understood, insecure attachment style and anxiety.

Later in life I would find myself very lonely, just fired out of a dream job, I really believed I had no future prospects. I was desperate for company, and knew that knowing what I knew about myself, there was no way that was going to happen sober. I was getting trashed daily in an attempt to form a meaningful relationship with a woman, typical behavior for me. I had no standards, and asked a random girl online if she wanted to hang out. We met, she was physically deeply flawed, particularly in the dental category. Still, what she lacked in teeth she made up for with other features and personality, I'd tell myself. She had a big house, a ton of money, a big tv, she was a chef, had a dog, this was perfect. ""I will never need a job, I probably couldn't get and keep one anyway"", I'd tell myself.  I'll just pretend to like her for a while, get free shit, then I figured it would die down. Still, despite every red flag I threw at her, every misdeed, she kept moving full-steam ahead.  I kept the lie going,  I never could be the one to end things.

I'd have to be pretty drunk to trick myself into believing that I was actually enjoying her presence... On the matter of sex however, I had to be practically blacked-out. Even now, I can only actually recall having sex with her a handful of times. During all of this, I had the craziest thought, ""why don't I just marry her and keep the lie going forever, maybe it will stop being a lie"". I went against my moral compass, I even told my parents that were intensely confused but still supportive as always. Anytime they would question the relationship I'd simply tell them that I was happy and that I had finally learned to actually love her. I never course-corrected, I only picked up speed as I looked back at the now completely unrecognizable path I had taken, yup, I was lost alright. I was driven purely by ego and pleasure, only caring about myself.

At some point, I took on a new identity. I embraced all things evil. That is who and what I was, ""I am a bad person"", I said. Once I accepted this now, fact, about myself, I was in a freefall. I continued to do increasingly worse things as I used my last terrible thing to justify my next. No one said anything... no one tried to stop me. I still had everything, and due to not having to see my parents, I thought they believed my illusory happy life. My health saw steady decline, I gained 150 lbs,  my liver was starting to fail, my skin was destroyed by guttate psoriasis, I fell into an unspeakable depression...this went on for almost 2 years.

She began to take interest in someone at work, I saw it coming from a mile away, she'd  finally had enough. I asked my parents to find me a place to live. My parents already had a plan, I'd go to a rehab in California. Like a deeply-embedded parasite being baited by a raw piece of meat, I was afraid, I was angry at the world, but the thought of smoking weed by the ocean had me on a plane the next day. I lost everything in my vicinity, even the dog that I had called mine for 2 years. I didn't actually have ownership of anything. I settled for nothing and in return chose to live a lie so long as the alcohol and drugs kept flowing. I was sent to Awakening Recovery in  Beverly Hill's, California. Who knew such a place could exist? All of these rules were thrown at me, I was already dealing with PAW's and this was my first time trying to ""get sober"". Reality hit hard, and this brand was particularly cruel. I spent 26 days at this facility, most of my days were spent in a state of pure horror as I learned about the rules of the house. If you even take a step outside of a room without turning a light on, that's a strike. Strikes mean you have to write words, everything had a rule. Each time from 5:30AM-12AM you were doing choirs or writing words for missing a spot on the dishes. This was in an effort to teach accountability. I was stranded in California, you were not allowed to talk to your parents. I couldn't speak to them unless supervised and would not be given a cell phone or allowed a job for 6 months. I could not speak my native tongue with my parents, I tried to call my dad in the middle of the night in a panic and was punished for it. What was more is, I was being told that I was crazy, my addiction was talking, and my parents said I would not be allowed to return home. I'd have to become homeless in LA. I can still hear the pain in my dads voice as he told me this on the phone. I'd come to find out they had sent him a packet saying that I would try to go home and that I was being manipulative like I always have been. Once my stimulus check hit, it was over, like a computer being powered on. As soon as the decision had been made, I was unshackled, I took the power back and took the biggest leap of faith in my life. I was fairly certain my parents would catch me, but I really didn't know this time. If you decide to leave this facility they simply make you walk out the door and do not help you find arrangements, it's part of the program, its why people stay. People not only have no where to go but they fear their parents may really abandon them in LA out of all places. Knowing I had that stimulus money was enough for me to make the jump, even though it wouldn't realistically have covered the cost of making it back. I left, they do everything they can to start a fight with you before you go, insane. I saw someone get kicked out by the seniors there, every Wednesday, the graduates would come and ""group"" you. Pick out any mistakes you made and tear you apart. I kept trying to call my parents, they refused to speak to me. I found a hostel and really didn't know how much longer I had, I just knew for a fact I was never going back to the Awakening sober living, I would die before being subjugated to some new forms of punishment that they felt like making up.

All of this to say, my whole time in rehab has all served to teach me how absolutely batshit insane the addiction treatment industry is. Eventually, I went to another rehab that had its own set of problems, experienced a HIPAA violation and abuse of all sorts. Still, I did have one good counselor that specialized in trauma. I am a psychology major, so just learning about the therapy was really cool. In all I had over six months completely alcohol free. That is, until I made the conscious decision to drink again. I do not want to count time, this sounds like the perfect excuse to kill yourself on a relapse plus I still believe that I can drink safely and responsibly AFTER having learned everything that I have, mostly on my own. My extensive research on addiction all suggests that treatment centers are doing more harm than good, along with AA's addiction model as being the most harmful development when it comes to addiction. The way that we think about addiction is the problem, and it is all painted by an arbitrary singular brush that is the AA hive-mind. Subsequently, treatment centers think this same way. The fact of the matter is, I made a choice to give up and give in, to take advantage of people, to hurt and kill even, I did this. I have a bottle Bacardi sitting in my freezer right now, I don't want to drink it. I have had it since last Friday, I had exactly 3 shots yesterday night. Nothing less, nothing more. That is what separates those of us who can actually beat this thing and those of us that stay sick or unhappy, doubting themselves forever with the ""disease of alcoholism"".  The fact that we can not only talk about ""Accountability"" but actually engage in the act. We do not accept feelings of shame anymore. We accept that we are humans, and that we make the wrong choices, that we are selfish, that we seek pleasure at the cost of others and that humans can be exceptionally cruel but that they can also be amazing, resilient, compassionate, kind, caring, intelligent, and every other good adjective you can think of! We don't need sobriety hierarchy or other ridiculous, quite frankly intellectually insulting methods of group-thinking that takes away the power and the ability to critically think for yourself! If sobriety is different for everyone, act like it!",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.72248423}"
2021-09-10 00:20:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pldwa8/any_recommendations_for_support_groups_eating/,Any recommendations for support groups? Eating disorder/food addicts?,"I recently came across Anna Lembke's work through the Huberman Labs podcast. I have  listened to her on several podcasts since and have replayed the different episodes at least a dozen times.

The basis of her message is that in modern day times, many people have developed addictions because we are constantly surrounded by highly stimulating, dopaminergic substances like our phones, social media, food, video games, etc. The way to beat this is to actively seek out more difficult experiences and in turn rely less on our substance of choice. The bulk of what she refers to are I guess ""smaller"" addictions. 

Her words really resonated with me because on any given day I feel so weak, depressed and not able to get normal, basic things done, and i hate myself for it. I used to date around, jump from boyfriend to boyfriend, and was never single for longer than 6 months since having my first boyfriend at 16. I also used to smoke a LOT of weed and couldn't really stay sober at home after a work day, i just needed to smoke right away after coming home. I couldn't handle being bored and not high. I am 29 now and have been single for a year. I had cut weed for a few months, but have recently began smoking again.

My main addiction is FOOD. Ever since I was a small child I can remember feeling this compulsive need to stuff myself with food. Even after I was full, I wanted to keep eating. I understand now this is addiction. My body was just chasing the next high. My weight has been a huge focus of mine for my entire life. My mom also cared deeply about her weight, and advised me from a young age to keep my weight down so I could be pretty. I really internalized this and have battled binge eating since being a little kid. My parents had to hide food from me, etc etc, the whole nine yards. I resorted to bulimia when I was a teenager. I used to skip a lot of school because I felt too fat to be seen. My family doesn't understand the extent of my weight issues, not a lot of people do. I am not overweight and I haven't been for a very long time. But I have been freaking killing myself with this and I am so sick of this lack of control. i am SO SICK of hating my body and studying my face and cheeks and not allowing myself to be happy because of the number on the scale.

Every god damn day I think about food, food food food, it is always on my mind, calories, don't eat this, if you eat that you'll want to puke it, that will lead to this, dont do that, blah blah blah, FOOD FOOD FOOD. I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE. I feel like a pathetic excuse for an adult. i can't control myself with food. we have a snack drawer at work and I am absolutely consumed by the thought of protein bars, chips, granola bars in there. At work i count down the minutes until lunch time. right at 12pm i go downstairs and my heart is racing and i buy my first meal. then i buy another one. then another one. i bounce from cafe to food stand. the bagel store. the salad bar. chocolate protein balls at the restaurant a few blocks up. a bun and chicken salad at the grocery store. i know the exact calorie contents of many different foods. i do the math in my head. how much do i have left... i can have one more granola bar and then i cant eat for the day. shit, i ate too much, i know exactly which food court bathroom to use to throw up, the one with the most privacy. i used to leave all my money at home so i couldnt buy food at work. so i started going to the bank and requesting a new debit card. or walking around downtown scanning the ground for quarters. 0.30 and i can buy a timbit.

i cant stand my lack of impulse control with food. i cant stand how much i desire food. and i cant stand that i dont have anyone to talk to about it. i cant afford therapy, paritally because i spend so much money on food. the extent of this is really, really bad and i know this is maybe not the right place to write about it.  does anyone know of any online support groups that could be helpful? i have heard of OA. i have tried a few of the meetings, but i didnt feel i fit in. i know that doesnt sound quite right. i am wondering if there are other options?

In a weird way, I felt very comforted by Anna Lembke's words because I truly think I have an addict's mind. I get addicted very easily. I have truly made an effort to stop this. i stopped dating, i stopped weed, but the food thing has been with me for so long and it just feels impossible. i was doing very well for the last week or so, but today i ""relapsed"" and binged again. i hate my lack of impulse control. i have been trying to do the hard things, even small hard things, and sit through the pain, even for a little bit, to strengthen my mind. but today i gave into a craving and then the rest of the day went to shit.

2021-09-09 13:06:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pl1y9g/need_some_advice_on_game_addiction_because_it/,"Need some advice on game addiction, because it feels like it's bordering on dangerous levels mentally.","Someone suggested I post this here rather than /r/myfriendwantstoknow. Let me just start with saying that I've suffered depression for at least half of my life, and while it is medicated, I've never found therapy to be that helpful because I always found it too predictable. But, I'm starting to reconsider, because one of my problems recently has been a little more specific, and I don't know if these are caused by learning difficulties such as Dyspraxia or Asperger's.

I have a dangerous addiction to video games, even if I don't enjoy them, and that's when it hurts the worst as I'm getting the worst of both worlds, taking time away from my other hobbies or studies, and not enjoying myself.

If I see someone on YouTube who can do something, my brain will wonder why I can't either, and that leads me to a problem I've had for months now. Last year I had the same experience but I managed to persist for reasons that'll become clear.

Streets of Rage 4 is, as the name implies, a sequel to the trilogy by Sega which was handed off to three other developers. The game has problems and I become very toxic playing it, to myself and possibly others, because I feel so negative while playing it and after. The game has a steep learning curve and even the standard difficulty will piss people off to start with.

I managed to get a platinum in the game, but it was painful. Mentally I knew I did everything the trophy listed, so I could 'free' myself from it as it felt more harmful than fun.

However a DLC has introduced a new difficulty, new characters and new modes, and essentially what I've been addicted to trying to do has been borderline impossible. One certain level on the (new) hardest difficulty has engaged this side of my brain that has made me lose hours of my day, trying and failing, feeling like I'm hitting my head on a brick wall.

Because the games like to give you a 'rank' at the end of each level (something the older games never did), it feels like an insult when you don't get the highest rank, or at least it does for me. Imagine at the end of a Rambo film, someone followed him with a clipboard and gave him a B.

It's hard for me to accept failure, especially when so many other people on the Internet enjoy and don't get half as toxic and beat themselves up as much as I do. A ton of people on YouTube and Reddit will boast about how they did the entire game perfectly, and make it sound like it was just something they did in their spare time in a few tries.

I just don't want to admit that I'm mentally deficient, or that I will never be able to accomplish what they have. But the other side of my brain finds this impossible, and the two give off this cognitive dissonance. It's impossible and based on pure luck, but it's also not impossible and it's just me who lacks in 'skill'.

And I don't know what my options are. People will suggest professional help, but in the UK, just getting help isn't easy. You have to wait for a specific window to make appointments, be put on a waiting list, and probably have to talk to someone who tries to advice more than listen. That's even if the NHS even supports it, or my reasoning for needing counselling isn't too pathetic for them.

And just as a small edit, I've tried to bring this up to the game's community so many times, and while people do listen and give their experiences, it often feels overshadowed by people simply telling me to stop playing if I don't like it, or getting extremely defensive when I complain about something specific and going on a rant about how you need 'skill', which makes me feel twice as bad. Sometimes I will make posts, on the Discord or Subreddit, and will just delete it before the inevitable shower of downvotes and negativity.

In my opinion, if I'm allowed an opinion, the game is fundamentally broken and that's why the developers still ask for feedback on Twitter to this day. I do everything these people do on YouTube (with their obnoxious noises and facial expressions) do and I still have to restart a level hundreds of times just because of how everything works. But as I said above, if I mention that to people, I will get people convincing me that I'm just crazy or inefficient at the game and that it's because I lack practise. And it has put me in this state of mind that I'm legitimately questioning my self-worth and sometimes borderline suicidal thoughts.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8803567}"

Need to vent.,"As the title goes, I'm in active addiction. Nothing In particular, it's anything I can get my hands on and can afford. Nothing hard like down, crack or meth. I realize I've had an addiction for awhile   however as of lately I've noticed it's taking its toll on me. 

Its gotten worse since a traumatic expierence last year which made me spiral and a lot of other people as well. This expierence has made me better myself while simultaneously made me have longer binges with certain drugs. The worst part about it all is that since the trauma happened, a lot of my friends got sober while I've been keeping it a secret and no one really knows. Its hard to be the only one who knows and not knowing how to admit I need the help. 

Throughout the last year since said expierence I've noticed I've had longer periods of soberity but intense binges once I get back into said drugs. With the winter months coming up, I fear it may get worse. 

About 8 months ago I was diagnosed with unspecified bipolar but need revaluation for possible bpd. I've since asked for meds but without a family doctor I cannot get them. Where I live, finding a doctor is extremely hard right now and so I fear I may not be able to get the meds I need. So instead, ive been on a bender trying not to feel whatever it is i feel. Its been tiring. 

I am not proud. I feel pathetic. Some of my closest friends are sober and have no clue I'm still using. I feel like absolute shit over it and am afraid to tell them I am using more than I should be. I am scared of the disappointment and the abandonment. The worst part about it all is that I'm not even sure if I want the help. As of now, I am going through a bad depressive episode and  think I dont ""want"" help but reality is that I truly need it. When I am in a good headspace, I know its an issue and love being sober. With the way things are as of lately, its hard to even want to be sober. It scares me everyday how much ill let everyone down if they knew. 

I grew up with drug addicted parents so a lot of my family dont think I'm an addict because its not one anything hard but reality is that I am. I hate being an addict. Sure, I don't steal from my family or do things to get drugs but I sure as hell am always fucked up and make it a priority. Its been 4 months since I've been fully sober and it breaks me. I'm not even sure I've ill ever be sober longer than 2 months. 

I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest since I can't tell anyone. I'm even too scared to tell my therapist. I feel ashamed.

I've a huge problem. I'm 18 years old now, in my final years of school and I'm fucking up really hard. Let me explain: 

(I know this is maybe better on the nofap subreddit but many people are toxic there.) I discovered the heavenly feeling you get from masturbating when I was 10 years old. It then slowly became more and more as I got older. When I was 11 I was doing it 1-3 a day and when I was in high school at age 15 I was doing it 5-10 times a day. Insanely much. Of course this took a lot of time. And that's where the problem starts to come. I do it like around 5 times a day now, but I skip many stuff because of it. I fuck up my sleep, I come late everywhere, don't go to school much. It's really a problem and I'm litteraly so addicted I don't know what to do. If I try to stop my addiction shifts over into another part in life. Let me explain:

I tried to quit many many times, but as a result I picked up a YouTube addiction with it. A severe one. I'm watching 6 hours a day at least on YouTube. And it makes you feel horrible. I've almost nothing left in life. 

All this resulted in depression like symptoms and I've borderline personality disorder now :(
I know I know prof. Help, but the waiting list is very long. I can't wait for that. I would rather die to escape the way I'm living. I'm exhausted completely, everything seems like a drag, everything seems to much. I struggle going to school regularly, my few friends finished a year previously, so there is no fun to be found at school. And I don't feel a genuine connection with anyone. 
I feel very empty and alone, emotionally numb, I've been so far even to almost commit suicide last year. But I couldn't do it in the end. Too hard. 

My friends are already done with school because I had to redo a year, because of 3 years ago I felt like shit, this masturbating and YouTube watching combined with me just being exhausted of the people at school made me fail that year. I've never liked going to school. Always been a drag but it's especially hard now... I've been at home for a week now, and I don't know how to to get out of this way of living. 

To summarise: quite a lot of mental struggles and addictions, besides that I started using increasingly more weed, not in a fun way like I used to with friends when I was younger. The YouTube and masturbating addiction is also really bad. 

And then finally I've trouble sleeping, I don't want to sleep, it's a form of sedating myself, to make reality less harsh, and so I've more time for my addictive behaviours.  For those who sleep deprived themselves once. They know you feel as if you're a bit drunk. So it's not good. 

I stopped sporting and yea... I've literally nothing left in life. 

I feel very ashamed of myself. And I'm really in need of help, to get my life back together and find a god damn purpose to fulfil in this world, because if I don't I'm not gonna stay here and rot away. Ending it is a daily thought. 

I've tried so many things now, I really hope someone reads this and can help me. 

This an important note: Since I'm conscious let's say since I'm 5 years old I've been very scared to get older, it's my deepest fear, because I get more responsibility less time to play and wander around, and I was so scared to end up homeless as a nobody since as long as I can remember. I've no idea where this fear came from. But every day it seems to get more real. And that frightens me. 


You don't have to read the following
(A recent example to clarify my life: 
I've gotten to bad at 4 am because I didn't want to sleep at all, I ate shit foods and stayed up masturbating and watching YouTube to not have to be confronted with reality, eventually I fell asleep, and woke up at 10am, very tired and exhausted, I already missed 2 classes at that point, I stayed in bed watched some YouTube, because I feel to ashamed of myself to still go to school 12km by bike, follow the rest of my classes, having teachers ask me where I've been. I can't look myself in the eyes, how I can look them in the eyes?, I'm just debating to go or not go, everything in me wants to stay home safe. I've to pick up something at the pharmacy for my feet, even that seems like too big of a struggle) it's not that I'm very unhappy, yes I am, but I'm not crying, I'm just feeling as if reality is not really real if that makes sense)",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.91124356}"

Idk if my ADHD could affect that or not I guess I would have to go to a professional but I just wanted to talk to other people on here first.

Me and my girlfriend split for about 4/5 weeks back in December last year so i started talking to other girls as you do when you're on the rebound and I should also say I do fine with 'the ladies'. I dont find it very difficult to speak to them or even set things up, Im not super attractive but I get by pretty well but I found that I wasn't really all that interested in sex with these other women. I liked talking and sending naughty or flirtatious things but honestly once any conversation ever ended up getting somewhere sexual and I would get aroused I would just sort of pander off and go onto whatever website and watch porn and then the next morning I tell whoever that I just fell asleep.

It sort of just happened so I'm writing this out of some sort of post nut clarity but I'm starting to think that this might be a real issue.

She rejected me telling me she couldn’t see me that way but I never realized that’s what she meant till now. I thought she meant she couldn’t see me that way because of the position she held over me.

I was obsessed with her, I stalked her online presence and found all the information about her that I could. I know too much.

For years I wanted to ask her out and was trying to find a way to, sometimes even now I still think I can. I can’t handle my obsessive thoughts anymore I’m afraid my obsessive thoughts will lead me to do greater stalking like behaviour. I’m scared for who I am becoming.

What. A. Prick.

That's exactly what I thought and truth is, I still think the guy was a prick.

But sitting here at 37 I wonder if he saw something I was missing.

At the time I wasn't into anything big.

I liked to drink with my friends on the weekend, but that's about it.

I had gone through a short stint from 19 - 20 where I messed around with opiates. I quickly found out what withdrawals were, and that there were penalties for short term pleasures. Horrible experience and I thought it taught me to avoid them. Well it did, for a while anyways.

Fast forward about 4 years to 26 and my girlfriend of 5 years and I had broken up.

It took a pretty big toll on me.

It was around this time I started messing with opiates again, mainly norco/vicodin. I freaking loved those things because it made the psychological hurt less, and at the time I had a pretty nihilistic view on life so I told myself I didn't care.

I quickly became addicted and sought refuge in Kratom.

I thought I had found the solution but quickly realized I'd just traded one addiction for another. In retrospect, it is so obvious that there is never a free lunch in life. The more you suffer the better you feel and visa-versa.

And that went on for quite some time, until I finally went to a doctor who prescribed me buprenorphine.

This was a game changer for me.

I knew it wasn't really that much different from what I was doing; the difference was in the half life of the drug and the fact that I couldn't increase the dose to increase the good feelings.

Once the novelty of that wore off I started looking for other things, namely alcohol.

And for the past 11 years or so I have been on and off buprenorphine, mostly on. And sometimes alcohol, especially lately.

I've been able to quit everything. But never for long.

I think that my biggest problem has been the fact that I never go too deep with anything. I always am able to pull back and get it together.

You would think this is a good thing but sitting here typing this I'm wondering if it isn't.

As far as my life goes, by normal standards I am pretty successful.

Nice house that I rent in a nice area. My own business which affords me plenty of discretionary income. Tons of free time (this is not good). Even got married a little over a year ago.

My wife knows about my struggles, I do not hide it from her. At times I feel like she wouldn't be with me, but I ""have it together"" by most peoples standards and I think this is why she gives me a pass.

Recently, I quit drinking for about a year which was one of the best years of my life. My business took off like crazy.

I was not drug free (still took buprenorphine) but wasn't doing anything but that on a regular basis. At the time I got obsessed with business/mindset stuff. In the beginning of that year I was super determined to get off of buprenorphine, but never managed to do it.

I think this has had a large psychological toll on me because I feel like if I can't trust myself to stick to something, how will I ever be able to accomplish the things I want in life/business? 

If I can't trust myself to stick to a taper, how can an employee trust me with anything? In business you lead by example, and if I can't stick to my own plan how can I expect my employees to ever see me as a leader? They can't and won't.

So I stopped drinking again about 4 months ago and made it about 3 months. But unfortunately I replaced booze with adderall and sometimes xanax, all the time telling myself this would be a short term thing to get past booze. The lies we tell ourselves.

Well, I started boozing again about 2 weeks ago, and now I've been hitting adderall / booze / bup / xnx pretty much daily. Not in large quantities, but like it matters. Bad news, very bad news.

I wake up each morning not feeling the greatest but have resolve. Today, I will not take all of these other things (except bup) as I know buprenorphine takes time to taper off of.

I know I can up and quit all of these other things pretty quickly. But every morning for the past 23 days I have said I will stop doing these drugs and start my buprenorphine taper and every day I end up doing some combination of an upper / downer + booze & buprenorphine with a little nicotine to top it off.

Obviously, I have major addiction issues and need to quit everything. I know this. Bup is ruining my digestive system and I have constant issues with hemorrhoids/bleeding.

I have never entered any rehab. I have always been able to quit things, but never for long periods of time (more than a year).

This is my second time ever posting about this shit on a public forum. Last time was in 2011 when I was trying to get off Bup for the first time, which I successfully did (for 3 months).

So why am I writing all of this? I guess I just wanted to put all of this in writing as it's been going on in my head for a long time.

I can't just go to a rehab. I can't leave my business for months. I am very fortunate that I can afford to do that, have great healthcare, etc. But I am the captain of this ship and people rely on me.

I want to do this on my own, and maybe my best bet is to just post here everyday for some accountability.

Oh and lastly, I've always had somewhat high BP. This has been a constant worry for me. It's frustrating, as I work out regularly and am in good shape. All of my blood markers and everything else is really good. But I know the constant nicotine, booze and uppers are what is doing it (and obviously genetics).

2021-09-07 22:52:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pk218d/not_sure_if_my_addictions_are_really_addictions/,Not sure if my addictions are really addictions,"My 5 vices are video games, caffeine, alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana. For the record, I have quit all of these at different times, the last one being caffeine. (About a year for weed, 5 months for video games, 2 months for alcohol and cigarettes, and 6 weeks for caffeine). Throughout my life I have struggled with reliance on external sources/substances for pleasure/stress relief/energy/etc, but some of them are worse than others, and I'm not sure if all of them are really addictions. 

I can say with absolute certainty that video games are nothing but detrimental to my life. When I'm plugged in to gaming, it is a true addiction where all aspects of my life completely go down the toilet. 100% abstinence from video games is the only way for me.

100% abstinence from cigarettes is also the only viable option in my mind, the cost/benefit ratio in my life regarding cigarette smoking is clearly more harm than good. Luckily, I've only been an on and off smoker (more off than on) for about 6 years (I'm 28), and even when I did smoke, I would only have about 5 a day absolute max. So abstaining from cigarettes is not too difficult for me unless I am extremely stressed or constantly surrounded by smokers. The rest are more nuanced and subtle.

The reason I used to consume caffeine was because I constantly felt tired, and I felt like it was a good pick-me up in the morning. I wasn't drinking that much, only one in the morning, and once in a while one after lunch if I was really tired, but it was consistent, pretty much every day. The reason I'm doubting quitting caffeine now though is that it has been long enough where I should start seeing the benefits (not only of not being on caffeine, but quitting all of my addictions), but I haven't really experienced them yet. I have basically the same amount of energy as before, my moods can still vary wildly, I still wake up frequently in the middle of the night, and I still have the same amount of anxiety as when I was on caffeine. The only difference now is that I don't get that initial burst of excitement from my coffee in the morning. Keep in mind that I tick pretty much all the boxes for living a healthy lifestyle (relatively healthy diet, lots of water, enough time for sleep, meditate, exercise, etc), so I'm not really sure what the problem is, but I'm starting to think it wasn't the caffeine. 

And lastly I used to use alcohol and weed for similar reasons, both because I used to just have so much damn fun when I was drunk or high. Obviously overdoing it was always a bad time, but some of the best memories of my life are from when I was drinking or smoking weed, so it's difficult for me to view them as toxic, because I have received a lot of benefit from them in my life. Another reason they are difficult for me to quit is because I didn't use them every day. I have had the ability to abstain from both of them for long periods of time without any real issue. And when I was using them, the most it would ever be was on Friday and Saturday night every week. Although I know there is a heavy cost associated with both, especially alcohol, I just can't seem to make up my mind if it is worth it or not to completely quit drinking or smoking weed. Also, same with caffeine, I don't really feel any of the benefits that everyone talks about. I still feel basically the same on a daily basis.

I know video games and cigarettes are a no go for me, but do you think I can have a more sustainable relationship with caffeine, alcohol, and marijuana? Or did I make the right choice by quitting them completely? I realize my cravings for video games and cigarettes are very reptilian and will only bring me harm, but I feel like caffeine, alcohol, and marijuana genuinely add richness and enjoyment to my life that just can't be replaced by being sober.

Will he be okay?,"Tl;dr: fiancé got home from horrific detox experience and was clean for 11 days. He relapsed for 3. Did he entirely reset himself?

My fiancé recently went to a detox facility (for fentanyl withdrawal) where he was essentially abused by staff. He was there for 11 days. For those entire 11 days, he was unable to hold down any foods or liquids. He kept begging staff to help him / to call him an ambulance, but they refused to do so. He literally threatened - in the middle of the night - to walk to the local highway and flag down a highway patrolman to get help… and all that got him was a phone call from one of the administrators stating “you should be grateful you’re even at our detox! You’re just dope sick, deal with it!”. 15 hours later (after one of the night nurses took sympathy on him and literally saved his life by emailing the CEO and executive board, etc., and stating that he {my fiancé} needed medical help), he finally got an ambulance to a local hospital.

But they weren’t done yet. Before the facility would allow the ambulance to take him, they made him sign a form on a nurse’s phone - a form that he wasn’t able to even review (while in a TON of side pain) - and THEN gave the signed forms to the ambulance company. They never even let him READ what he signed. He signed it because he was in a TON of pain at that point and was extremely weak, and he knew there was no way he could get any hospital help if he didn’t (they lock all the personal cell phones away, which we both understand - but they also lock down ALL other phones {which we both understand a lot of facilities do}, and the issue was he was so weak and so afraid that if he didn’t sign this nebulous form that there would be NO possible way to access 911 service, as all personal devices were revoked and all public devices were non-existent… he had been trying to get 911 help for like 9 DAYS AT THAT POINT with NO LUCK, and was LEGITIMATELY AFRAID HE WAS GOING TO DIE AS THIS WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY OUTSIDE 911 CALL HE WAS ABLE TO MAKE).

So he finally made it to the hospital on day 10 (I posted about this story earlier and then later on realized I got some details and the range of days wrong, and felt it was majorly important to include some details, so here we are). He told the staff AT the hospital AND IN the ambulance that he did NOT feel safe going back to the detox program and to PLEASE NOT SEND HIM BACK, but they must have thought he was kidding, because of course they sent him back. As he had zero access to his devices and was 10+ hours away from home, he went back after he realized that nobody was going to help him. He said that he didn’t feel like he had a choice; nobody even contacted me when he went to the hospital even though I am his emergency contact or
I would have traveled to get him! He wasn’t court-ordered to be there - he was there volitionally, but he was 10+ hours from home without a vehicle (thank God he didn’t have a vehicle with him because he was so damned weak he would’ve wrecked it on the drive!)

The program was an absolute failure. Fiancé went there and got so sick that he couldn’t hold down food or water for 10+ days, and they REFUSED to take him to a hospital until he went ballistic and threatened to walk to the nearby highway and flag down a highway patrolman.

After the whole hospital fiasco, even though he made it very clear to multiple people at said hospital that he didn’t feel safe going back, they sent him back anyhow.

Then, because he still couldn’t eat (which is a physical health issue obviously), they THREATENED TO 302 HIM (which is an involuntary psych hold), which would be DISASTROUS for his career field.
He is legit traumatized over the whole ordeal. He demanded to go home after that and because it would be ending his program “early”, they told him - a dude who WAS SO WEAK DUE TO THE FACT THEY WOULDN’T GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL AND GET HIM FLUIDS, etc. - HE WOULD HAVE TO WALK TO THE BUS STOP, which, by CAR, is well over an hour away.
These motherfuckers literally withheld emergency services from him and fought him on going home, to the point that when he finally came home, he was so weak that he passed out twice. The conductor on the train he took home was so concerned for his health that he asked if he needed to stop at the next graded crossing to get him an ambulance.
I am talking to lawyers for him as soon as he recovers a bit more, and if/when a lawyer says it’s okay to name the facility, I’ll post the name here.

So… I guess my whole question is - he had 11 days clean. When he came home he relapsed for a few days and is getting clean again right now on his own. He relapsed for approximately 72 hours. Do you all think he “reset” himself to the point where his WD at home is going to be damned near impossible? Thanks for reading!",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.64918333}"

We have a 10 year old son & a 1 year old daughter. He's been addicted to an OTC substance called Benzedrex for nearly 8 years. This substance has been compared to meth. He disassembles the container, soaks the cotton that comes in the container in lemon juice & then drinks the substance. He does this in our detached garage. Our son has found this drug & has come to me & my in-laws telling us he knows his dad is using a drug. Lately, his addiction has had some extreme consequences for my children & myself. The below incidents have happened in the past 3 weeks.
1.) He threw a huge bowl of cereal across the room at the wall in front of our kids while I was outside on the phone. My 1yo daughter was so scared she immediately started screaming.
2.) He threw a box of kitchen items (glasses, knives, etc.) in the hall, causing broken glass to go everywhere.
3.) He broke my television that was in our bedroom, ripped several dresser drawers out & tore all the clean laundry out of the drawers & threw it all over our bathroom.
4.) He punched a huge hole in the wall of our back bathroom.
5.) He sleeps for nearly 24 hours & then stays awake for days at a time.
6.) He lost his job, which was our only source of income as I'm a stay-at-home mom to our kids. I don't work because I don't trust him to watch our kids alone (especially my 1yo daughter).
7.) He got angry about 2 trash bags that couldn't fit in our trash can that I took out to the street. He texted me calling me a ""lazy parasite"" & put a rotten potato in my car, causing my car to be filled with maggots & fruit flies.
While I used to say he'd never hurt me or the kids, his behavior has become so erratic & aggressive, I no longer know what he's capable of & I'm constantly afraid of him. His parents bought our house for us back in January & we took over the mortgage but the house is still in their name. He is also on parole for a very bad DUI & car accident that resulted in him crashing into someone's home. I need to get him out of my home & away from our children. We split up 7 years ago I was awarded sole custody of our son. His parents support me in anything I need to do to protect my children, but they won't do anything themselves. My only idea was to tell him he could either go to rehab or move out of our home & not have any contact with our kids until he got clean. I've been planning on doing that next week. If he doesn't leave willingly & refuses rehab, a police officer friend told me I have enough evidence to get a PFA against him that has me & both kids on it.

(tw?)","I've realised my life may have been just a flurry of distractions and addictions, though I'm loathed to use the word. I self harmed multiple times a day throughout most of being a teenager. Then I started smoking at 15, and drinking and smoking weed at 16/17. I would take meds whilst drinking in college, making myself purposely ill but I never really knew why. Then when I began going to clubs, it was binge drinking - blackouts, fights, meltdowns, rec drugs, etc. I began smoking weed daily when I was about 18 and haven't missed a day since (22, now).

Covid put an end to all the binge drinking sprees. No more police car rides home, or waking up in the middle of the street. I feel good about it even if I miss the party and club scene. Now just a cider makes me ill and thats enough to put my off most of the time. But honestly? There are points in the day, or even upon waking up, where my brain goes ""fuck it, get fucked"" and we're thinking of the shots, the lines of coke or ket or throwing it right back to md. 

But frankly, non of these things have done me dirty like weed. I cut down a ton last year, from smoking 3-4g a day to barely half a g. I was able to start building my savings back up, and I felt freer for I didn't have the intense need to smoke, or the need for more and more to achieve a decent high.

But hell, I'm right back in that hole. Only this time I really did reach out for support, informing my psychiatric nurse. But my concern was shrugged off, as it ""helped"" during low moods/crisis. Its a from months since then, and now I'm broke with no savings, no way to pay back, I may need to take out a loan and I am putting on hold things I need to do, and terrified if I fail to pay my rent and bills, whilst also not wanting to go back to ""alternative methods"" of generating a quick income.

So, in short. I really sort of had my life on track but now I am in a worse position than ever. I've never been able to quit, and I want to quit. And I want to quit and not have the smoking replaced with any other bullshit. I really just want to make my own money, volunteer a little, and live on a little farm with my dog, so why does my brain do this and how do I get actual support/help? More so, how do I stress how dire things are right now to my nurse? What even are my options, as I was recently told I'm too ""unstable"" for MBT therapy. My life feels like a big old ""yikes"" right now.

I’m 20 years old, and since March 2020 I have been getting high everyday. It started off as a way to pass the time, lockdown had just started in the UK and I knew someone making some edibles, so I bought some thinking it would be some fun. It was at first, I would have some on a Friday or Saturday night and not think much of it the next day. But then my mental health started to go down hill. I felt very lonely and extremely depressed and started to smoke it, which then turned into an everyday thing. I have tried so hard to get myself to stop smoking it, but I can’t. The only time I feel peaceful and forget about majority of my problems is when I’m high. I want to stop so bad and I’m quite scared. I have been on antidepressants since July but I feel as if they are not working. I’m so lost on what to do and I feel extremely isolated with it. 

Sorry if this was long. I’m just very confused and lost. If anyone could offer advice I would greatly appreciate it.

EDIT: Thank you so much to all the people who have reached out and given advice, this has really motivated me to be weed free and yesterday was my first full day without smoking anything! I threw all of it away without even a second thought. I don’t feel so alone with this now and have also told my two very close friends who admitted they were a bit worried about me, but they’re glad I told them and so am I.

**Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction**

Hi, 

My name is Saul Celere, and I'm an alcoholic. I'm happy to say that I haven't had a drink since the 1st of January this year, and I'm optimistic about my sober future.

I am also a philosopher and a theoretical physicist. My education was heavily scientific, and like a lot of people in the modern world, I view existence and our Universe logically and scientifically.

Over the last few decades something of a scientific consensus has been reached concluding that God does not exist; not all scientists are atheists, but most of them are, and if you ask a lot of modern people why they don't believe in God, they’re likely to tell you that science proves such ideas untrue.

Until five or six years ago I was a member of this consensus. I thought of myself as a 99% atheist; I wasn't willing to say with 100% certainty there was no God, indeed, to make such a claim would require a God-like knowledge and understanding of existence and our Universe, otherwise, you might be wrong. But I was pretty much convinced.

This conviction of atheism prevented me from using the concept of a “Higher Power” whenever I would try to stop drinking; as soon as I heard any talk of a Higher Power, I would immediately, if privately, dismiss it as nonsense.

But Socrates has been my hero since I was a kid, and he said “Wisest is he who knows he knows nothing”. Well, thank God for Socrates and my 1% of doubt, because five or six years ago I had some scientific insights into the nature of Consciousness that cleaved open this doubt to reveal a new, expanded and very optimistic conceptual picture of our Universe and our connection to It.

Both God and the Human Soul, if they exist, are conscious entities, therefore, any new understanding of Consciousness can, at any time, alter or expand our understanding of God and how we relate to ... + Him+Her + ... ( God is much more than just male )

The scientific insights I had quickly led me to developing a very new and revolutionary, but rigorously scientific, conceptual picture of the Universe in which we live, and move, and have our being.

This has entailed me writing The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness. These principles have general applicability to all conscious systems, just like Newton’s Principles of Motion can be generally applied to all macroscopic dynamical systems. 

These Principles finally allow us to construct theoretical models of conscious entities and systems, such as the human nervous system. And, maybe more importantly, they can also be used to construct the first scientific, theoretical models of both The Mind of The Universe ( read Higher Power, God ), as well as the physical Human Soul.

These models are the means by which a resolutely scientific mind, such as my own, can find the concept of a Higher Power a plausible scientific reality. And, for me, finding a Higher Power genuinely, and logically, and scientifically plausible was absolutely essential to getting sober.

For the first time in my life I felt like I might be able to trust my Universe, that maybe my coming into existence wasn't actually a terrible, terrifying mistake, maybe I hadn't been born into a cold, dead, unfeeling, uncaring Universe, that I was totally separate from. 

Until then, I had conceived of my existence as a brief anomaly of personal Consciousness that would be followed, inexorably, by an eternity of total non-existence, and in retrospect I see how this conception of my existence undermined me as an inescapably moral and spiritual being.

But now God had become possible, and not just possible, but plausible, and even more plausible than no God. After three decades of atheism, this was the hell of a shock!!!  An “I need to lie down and breathe into a brown paper bag” kind of shock! And awe, lots of awe. Awe is quite like fear except it's a good thing, thrilling.

I'd been very unhappy for a very long time and I knew that my drinking was making my life worse and damaging my most meaningful relationships. But life was meaningless, pointless; whether I stopped drinking or not, whether I wound up with a family and friends, or completely alone, my own Universe was still going to eternally annihilate me.

The possibility of a Higher Power suggested the possibility of meaning and hope, meaning and hope that wasn't limited to just this one life I was making a mess of. So, I decided to conduct an experiment, an existential experiment, an experiment with my own existence, in which I was both the scientist and the rat.

I asked myself, “If a Higher Power does exist, what would … + He + She + … advise me to do, and, very importantly, what not to do?” 

Top of the list was to stop drinking, and to really stop. And if I managed to stop for a few weeks, to stay stopped once I inevitably started whispering sweet nothings to myself about “Well, we can have one or two, just on the weekend, with my girl, that's ok…”

I can't say the experiment was a success because it's still going on. I had thought if I were to ever find God it would mean automatic, perennial happiness. In reality it has required me to work harder than I've ever worked in my life. But as I keep up the experiment I can't deny that I am happier than I was. 

The happiness is like when we used to roll a small snowball into an enormous “snowwheel” when we were kids; it gets bigger slowly, imperceptibly, and I have to keep pushing, but it's much more pleasant to be a happy Sisyphus halfway up the mountain, than a sad Sisyphus motionless at the bottom, paralyzed by his own nihilism.

Faith in a Higher Power made me realise my happiness is intimately related to my morality; that I will never be happy as long as I'm not making a concerted effort at self improvement, an effort that I don't abandon every time I get too stressed or have an argument with my girlfriend.

The more seriously I take my moral health the better my life becomes. ( Slowly, and it's hard, and it still regularly shocks me how hard it is; if I were to ever meet God, and assuming I didn't immediately go for His throat, I'd say “All this, the Universe, existence, the stars, Earth, the plants and animals, Humanity etc., it's all amazing, but you've put the emotional, psychological, difficulty level up way too high! ) 

Anyway, all of this began with me finding God a plausible scientific reality, so, I wanted to help anyone who is finding it difficult to reconcile a modern scientific understanding of our Universe with faith in a Higher Power.

Here is a lecture/podcast called “Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction” in which I explain what Principia Theologica is:

[Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction](https://youtu.be/8NQJQN0D9A4)

In the description is a link to episode 1 of around 12 episodes of Principia Theologica, in which I outline a rigorously scientific approach to the Higher Power. If the picture of our existence painted by the modern interpretation of science depresses or scares you, there is great hope and relief to be found in these philosophical ideas and the truth about our physico-conscious being.

Best of luck on your journey!!!

Its only been 3 years since I fully accepted these circumstances and 12 years since my first treatment center. Although I have relapsed in the past 3 years I haven't fought with the idea that I'm an addict who has to remain absinent from substance. 

I've met people who went to a meeting and never looked back and have remained clean and sober for 40 years. I've met people who have been going to meetings for 30 years and have 1 day. I went to treatment with a fellow who had 25 years sober from alcohol and started drinking for a few days before promptly calling up the treatment center to get back on track. We are all different. 

I'm spiritual although not religious. I believe there are many paths to get where we are trying to go, we all may not take the same one and some may take several different paths. Perhaps the path doesn't end at all and there is no end destination and just being content on the path your on is the goal. I really couldn't tell you.

As I was writing this post my 2 year old son came up to me with a book, and I paused writing and we read paw patrol then started watching trains on YouTube. For me this is what life is all about. I am happy. I accept my situation and that I'm not as far ahead in life as I could have been had I accepted it 12 years ago. There is no doubt in my mind that had I given up on giving up, I wouldn't be here today. I didn't do this alone and you don't have to either. I am fortunate to have a wonderful support system around me but I know that not everybody does. 

Years ago I had accepted that I would die from addiction.
I accepted the high cost of low living. I accepted that I was worthless. I won't accept that anymore. I am an addict and I will die and addict, but I am also a husband, a father and a friend; a son and a brother. I laugh, I love, I still get upset and have bad days but I am alive. I'm human.

I just wanted to update you all on how the experience was, because we are having to look into hiring a lawyer due to his experience. So here’s what happened to him there:

Just want to update you all on this -  the program was an absolute failure. Fiancé went there and got so sick that he couldn’t hold down food or water for 10+ days, and they REFUSED to take him to a hospital until he went ballistic and threatened to walk to the nearby highway and flag down a highway patrolman. 

Then, because he couldn’t eat (which is a physical health issue obviously), they THREATENED TO 302 HIM (which is an involuntary psych hold), which would be DISASTROUS for his career field.

He is legit traumatized over the whole ordeal. He demanded to go home after that and because it would be ending his program “early”, they told him - a dude who WAS SO WEAK DUE TO THE FACT THEY WOULDN’T GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL AND GET HIM FLUIDS, etc. - HE WOULD HAVE TO WALK TO THE BUS STOP, which, by CAR, is well over an hour away.

These motherfuckers literally withheld emergency services from him and fought him on going home, to the point that when he finally came home, he was so weak that he passed out twice. The conductor on the train he took home was so concerned for his health that he asked if he needed to stop at the next graded crossing to get him an ambulance.

I don't understand addiction. Help.,"We've been together 5 1/2 years, and are very happy together. We meal prep, both work, spend time together, rarely fight. Our life is very normal and happy.

Except for this one thing.

My boyfriend who meditates, works out, studies health science... is an alcoholic. He doesn't know why. I don't know why. We're both scared and tired of having fights over it.

Last October, I came home from college classes to find him incoherent. His eyes were rolling in his head, he was slurring his speech, and barely keeping up with conversation. I kept asking what was wrong because I was very worried. He finally tells me he ""smoked a little weed"". 

At dinner time, I cook, and he goes to the bathroom to throw up. I assume he's sick. He's gone for the next 30 minutes. When I go to check on him, there's no answer. He has a fainting disorder so I immediately assume he fell in the bathroom and hit his head. Terrified, I run to get his mother (we live with his parents). She bangs on the door, and when we can't get it open, she gets an ax to break it down. Then he answers the door. He fesses up to us that he had ""some wine"" and passed out. 

We didn't have any wine. When his parents leave, he shows me his liquor stash. I was VERY shocked.

Over the past year, these random blackout sessions have happened again. Sometimes when we have guests over, and we've had to end parties early due to his drunkenness, as he got in the pool with all his clothes on. I've tried to ask his parents for help, and he is their 'golden child' so they keep gaslighting me and telling me he doesn't have a problem and I'm embarrassing them by trying to talk to them about this. I can't tell anyone else. I've never had an addict in my life, so I don't know what to do. Even if I tossed all our alcohol, he could still drink behind my back when I'm away.

He's not a mean drunk. He's not a violent one, or a driving one, or a depressed one. He's just bored and probably a little overworked and drinks to incoherence, then drunkenly lies to me about it. Last night, it happened again. He lied to me about it, then fessed up after we fought for 45 minutes that he had had ""too many drinks to count"". He promised me that he wouldn't lie to me about it again, as I tried to reassure him I'm on his side and I want to help him get out of this. And he's going to try to find a therapist today.

But what do I do? What do I say, or offer, or take away? It's been a year and I'm so emotionally exhausted with this cycle, and I know he is too.

I have an estranged, alcoholic, and destructive father with whom I have no contact. This is very relevant to the below story due to the fact that because of the existing relationship with my father, I swore to myself I could not involve myself with another destructive addict.

Story
Basically, my fiancé is a drug addict and I'm not sure what to do about it: if I should leave him or stay and try and work through it.

In early June 2021, I caught him crushing up oxycontin to snort. He tried to lie about it but quickly admitted it after I told him I knew something was up. He admitted he started the habit after being cooped up in his office from working hard through covid and being isolated in his office for days on end and becoming a bit depressed because of this. He has had no history of depression in the past that I know of but was forced to go to an outpatient facility in his teens (17) for smoking marijuana (very strict/religious mother). I work nights so our time together has always been a bit finicky. He told me he took the pills orally for 8 to 9 weeks until he decided to snort them for only this last week, so a 10-week habit in total. He has smoked weed almost daily since I met him also and has done so since College (we're 29). He got the pills of the dark web.

We then agreed to then spend some time apart, as he had his parent's house to go to and I had nowhere to go aside from the house we own together. He immediately found a drug counselor whom he saw weekly, and also committed to going to NA meetings. I have met this counselor, whom I like and think is a good fit for him.

We spent about 8 weeks apart. During that time he was with his parents and attended NA meetings daily, working towards their ""90 meetings in 90 days"". His parents kept a close eye on him per both our requests, so he wasn't using during this time period.
About 2 weeks ago we then started to live together again after about 9 weeks from the initial incident.
Things were great, we were happy, we had sex, we did fun things together. He continued to go to meetings and communicate with individuals from those meetings (step work wasn't his thing due to lack of a higher power), he was more active, going to the gym, eating more, etc.
Then yesterday as his workday was ending, I was napping on the couch but got suspicious when he sneakily went upstairs into his old office (he moved his computer stuff downstairs when he moved back in). Lo and behold he was crushing up a pill to snort.

Justifiably I freaked out and asked him wtf.. he told me to drug test him as this was a ""trophy"" he had kept to see if he could beat this while still hanging onto a small amount, mentioning that he thought that if he could keep some and not use it, he had ""beaten it"", those were his words. Obviously that failed. The drug tests came back negative for everything, he also took another test that evening to prove it even further.

I'm at a crossroads here because I had said after the first incident that if I ever found him doing any drugs, weed included, ever again, that I was done. So here we are... what would you do if you were in this situation??

Thanks so much for reading if you've gotten this far.

TL;DR: Caught my fiancé doing drugs, he swore he wouldn't do them again, he got clean for almost 90 days, then I caught him doing drugs again. What do?

I suffered with severe depression and anxiety from age 5 or so. I was medicated at 15. He never had anxiety before adulthood. Or depression. He hit 18 or 19 and I have no clue what even happened but he behaved erratically. Drugs, a lot of them. I don’t think he’s ever taken heroin or meth before, but basically everything else.

We’ve grown apart a lot, but some of that may be the drugs. We’ve always seen that he has an issue since he was 17 or 18. He’d get in loads of trouble drinking, he punched holes in his wall black out drunk and got suspended from school for calling a coach and cussing him out. He is someone who once he starts he cannot stop. Despite my issues, I’m wholly unlike that.

He absolutely has untreated anxiety and depression like I said. He’s been “nearly” clean for a long time, but takes… kratom. He says the issue isn’t even the kratom. Im not sure what you know about kratom but it’s a pretty “mild” drug that you can get legally in my state. When he doesn’t take kratom (and he takes absurd amounts), he freaks out. FREAKS. He doesn’t even think it’s the actual drug necessarily. He’s taken it so long and so much and he has such anxiety that when he doesn’t take it he feels abnormal—cue horrible panic attack where he thinks he’s dying.

We’re not close anymore but my heart breaks for him. Im more able to speak about my issues, but we’re both hard and were taught that, as a kid, having emotions was wrong. So he doesn’t speak. He’s turned down mental health drugs for years.

I’ve been inpatient and PHP but not for drugs. He doesn’t know I know about this yet but I’m the best person in the family to give him the options. Im afraid for him. He’s going to be uncomfortable talking about himself. He hasn’t done that to anyone. They will likely put him on mental health meds. I’m afraid he won’t be compliant. He’s gonna be a hard nut to crack.

For years we’ve had the ongoing fight that you cannot be addicted to pot (I say yes - he says no). I’ve just had our second child, we have a toddler as well and he’s been doing his own thing pretty much since the baby has been born. I know he’s struggled in the past (before we were together) and told me he’s been clean. I, stupidly, believed him. 

Well, he admitted about a week and a half ago that his problem with pot and alcohol has spiralled out of control. He needs help. Because of Covid, our mental health help is backlogged and getting in to see a therapist could take months. My in-laws stepped in, and have offered him an option to do outpatient treatment. He’s accepted;he has his initial appointment next week, with a treatment plan soon to follow (5-10 days later). He’s also going to start celebrate recovery. All of these are positive things he’s doing and I’m glad for him. 

While I’ve been doing 99.9% of everything at home because he hasn’t contributed in the recent months (and much longer in fact if I’m honest with myself), now it seems like an overwhelming task. He’ll have work, his therapy, outpatient care and CR. Not to mention the complete lifestyle change that will need to happen, his determination to utilize the coping strategies he’s taught, and his own ability to manage all these things. I feel like our marriage has one thread hanging on, and I don’t know what to do. Life is awful right now. My toddler cries for his dad, sees me crying all the time. I know it’s not healthy for my husband to be in and out of his day to day life, my toddler not understanding what’s happening.

Social media addiction may not be headline news but it is prevalent in today’s society.

Overall, 40 percent of U.S. online users aged 18 to 22 years reported feeling addicted to social media.

Is it the validation? Are we really always bored? Or maybe we’re all just nosey!

This is important to know because it allows us to notice the signs and be in control.

Social media services like TikTok use 5 main methods to hook you in and keep you on their platform. 

Here they are:

1. Scrolling releases dopamine: have you heard of a Skinners box? Skinner was a psychologist that created a box with a mouse inside and when the mouse clicks a button it has the possibility of a reward. Likewise scrolling social media is a modern skinners box; with very scroll you have the possibility of achieving a reward in the form of an entertaining video 
2. Smart algorithm uses your data: TikTok collects A LOT of your personal data from your phone, and it’s why TikTok was the subject of a US privacy investigation. By collecting your personal data TikTok can tailor your feed to show you things you like.
3. Music to affect emotion: music is the most addictive thing in the world. Music affects our emotion and can be used to manipulate people and control them. Social media services like TikTok depends on music to keep users on the platform and this is the secret ingredient to why it’s so addictive.
4. Endless content: social media is designed so that you can scroll forever if you really wanted to. The content is endless because there is an abundance of people creating it. 
5. Unexpected, novel, snd surprising content: with every scroll you have a new experience and to your mind this is as addictive as cocaine. Novelty is one of the things our brain loves and social media is designed to appeal to this idea.

Those are the 5 methods used by social media services to hook you in and to keep you on their platform. 

But how can we prevent social media addiction?

Social media is a part of all our lives now, but there are 3 key ways to prevent addiction and excessive time wasting?

1. Minimise consumption: 
Yes, this really is the best way to go. Many people think quitting social media entirely is the only way to prevent its harmful effects, but that’s not feasible in today’s society. Instead, minimising the amount of time you spend on the app is the best option for most. This way you reap the benefits without too much of the negatives 

2. Tailor your feed
Social media is great for downtime but it can also be useful. Educational content is plenty and creators are constantly finding creative ways to educate their followers. It’s a good idea to vary the content you watch and try to strike a balance between education and entertainment.

3. Learn skills
This one is perhaps the most important one because it makes social media a tool for growth rather than a timesink. By learning skills you can then share them on social media and by becoming a content creator the possibilities are endless. You can take your own little part of the large reward these social media companies gain.

These are the 3 key ways to prevent social media addiction.

I (22F) live with my mom and dad. I have a half brother who lives in another state. I used to thank God every day for blessing me with the home life i was blessed with. My parents love me and they are my favorite people in the whole world. They are my absolute best friends. 

When i was growing up, my parents were off and on. One year we all lived together and the next year they were separated and my mom and i lived with my grandparents. 

My dad for as long as i can remember was my best fucking friend. He still is. We have so many amazing memories. There’s nothing in the world i can’t talk to him about. He’s my idol, my hero. 

The reason my raise were off and on for so many years was because of dads alcohol and pain pill addiction. Recently i found out his pill addiction turned to heroin which i assumed. He’d get clean for awhile, my mom would take him back. He’d fuck up, she’d leave him. 

He finally got clean for good and they got married in 2011 and we all lived together.

My dad relapsed in the beginning of this year and last week, my mom left us. Now it’s just him and i. i don’t know how far into detail i want to get. Living with the person i idolized my whole life in active addiction, which i never thought i’d ever see, is so difficult. 

I have to buy dinner, buy him smokes and let him use my car. He lost his job and his car is broke down. He used the money to fix it to get high. I have to hide my purse in my own house. If he asks me for money it turns into an argument. I don’t know how to feel comfortable in my own house anymore. 

Can someone relate? I have friends who have gone through similar situations and i’ve tried to reach out but i feel so alone and frustrated and sad and scared right now. Somebody help me.",1,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.56713426}"

Throughout that time, he has struggled with an addition to marijuana (and if you’re going to comment that one cannot be addicted to marijuana, please refrain). Back in the winter, he hit quite a low point; he started an intensive treatment program and ended up sober for 61 days. Since then, it’s been pretty off-and-on. He’ll have stretches of working really hard at sobriety, and then he’ll self sabotage. After he uses (usually edibles), he feels terrible, and even admits that he doesn’t like himself when he’s high. We always work through it, acknowledging that slipping up is part of the process and that we can learn from our mistakes. Today would have been his 13th day sober, but he used this evening. Yesterday, he called me saying he wanted weed, and we talked on the phone for a couple hours about why that wasn’t a good idea and discussed alternative options to distract him/get through the craving. Usually, he’s at least willing to try doing something else, but the past few days, he doesn’t want to put any effort in. He claims that relapsing is unavoidable and that I don’t understand (which I don’t claim to). I’ve urged him to see therapists who specialize in addiction, but he says “they’re not going to tell me anything I don’t already know. It’s a waste of my time.” He won’t go to a group. He won’t seek professional help of any kind, really. I’ve explained to him that it’s very overwhelming for me to try and support/coach him on my own (especially when he doesn’t want to put effort in). I know that shit happens, and I don’t expect him to be perfect, but I do expect him to put some work/effort in. Lately, he won’t. And he got upset with me when I said that I think a person’s willingness to work on themselves is a reflection of how much they’re willing to work on their other relationships. Again, not expecting perfection, just effort. I don’t know what else to do for him. I haven’t slept in a week, but I feel guilty because I know he’s having a hard time and I don’t want to make the situation about me. I just feel very stuck and very tired of the cycle we’re trapped in, and the fact that he doesn’t want to take the steps to break that cycle is frustrating (and a little hurtful).

However, I’ve each day been taking more. It’s only 1 pm and I’ve taken 4, and have just bought a bottle of fire whiskey to get me through the day. I wonder if this makes my depression worse , but I think because I’ve been through withdrawels so many times I can deal with that again.

Also because of Corona my dealer is charging me 250 a bottle which is 50 x 5mg pills, and I’m in financial hardship right now. Australia is in the worst lockdown even the world has had, helicopters flying over the suburbs.

2021-09-03 17:52:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pheozp/just_figured_out_im_addicted_to_workproblem/,"Just figured out I'm addicted to work/problem solving, and going to do something about it","I spent a good number of years working at home as a programmer and designer, business creator, entrepreneur etc. Some days I worked 16 hours for multiple weeks. Somewhere along the way I got addicted to that without even noticing. Specifically, the moment when I come up with an idea or a feature and start thinking how to implement it, then going to the actual implementation and the moment in which I did it successfully and all the little problems I solved along the way. That's a huge euphoria.

But I had no idea until just this last 1 or 2 years when I pretty much quit my job to focus on my ""dreams"". Suddenly having nothing to do and no ""problems"" to solve sent me into a depression and anxious state, restless. To the point that I started looking for problems that needed solving, workflows that needed optimising, activities in my life that could be automated. And then I created that habit of ""fixing everything"" that I came across. But I did this without noticing, I just thought I was being productive. 

I noticed this manifests in a few ways. The first way is me seeking and thinking about my lifestyle and thinking what could I make better about it. Mostly this is tech or game oriented. I'll then come up with ideas and go with one of them. 

Some examples:

* Backup and file sync server, future proof
* Organising my pictures by finding a photo management solution that ticks all my boxes
* Self-hosting pretty much every single digital aspect of my life, and boy there is a ton of self-hosted open-source projects so this is just never ending. Self-hosted ebooks, email, music library, monitoring, backup, websites, passwords, bookmarks, just all sorts
* Creating some program to solve an on-going problem or current part of a project that I'm working on

And much more. 

The other way it manifests is through a distraction from any activity which is NOT really related to this type of logical/organisation problem solving. Such as:

* Sitting down to make music, figure out it's taking me time to find good samples, stop making music and spend days organising my sample library, and at the end make no music
* Sit down to enjoy a retro game, find out that the TV picture isn't as good as it could be, so sit down and solve that so it looks as best as possible, but take it further to do the same for every single one of my retro consoles, only to end up playing nothing
* Sit down to do some digital drawing, but then I feel the tools I'm using are lacking so I seek other ones and then ways to learn them, but then when I spend time trying to learn the new tools I never drew anything in the long run

These moments happen whenever I try to relax or do something leisurely and passive. And quite often I just can't relax or focus on the activity and eventually before I even know it I'm working on the next mini-project or found a problem to solve which showed itself in front of me. 

Long story short, I will find a problem in **anything** and would rather procrastinate by solving the problem and then feeling a little euphoria about it, than just carry on with whatever I was doing and just acknowledging that there's a potential problem there and that's it. For example I was digital drawing on a small desk and I wanted a way to see reference images but not take up any room on the screen. So my solution was to get a second tablet just to display reference images and prop it up on the top. Then I wanted a way to easily pass images between the 2 devices, then I wanted a way to efficiently store all my reference images so I built an entire app to store collections of organised images, then I thought it would be cool to store not just images but videos and audios too, then it would be cool if I could also edit those images within the program I made. And before you know it months passed and I forgot the root of everything I was doing and actually quit digital drawing because I spent so long solving the problems I pretty much created. I didn't draw since May and it's already September.

I have not relaxed in the last 10 years. I've not sat and thought about ""nothing"", because I can't. I stopped playing games (except games which had extensive problem solving like strategy games) and reading and watching TV because it became too much of a passive activity for me and after a couple of hours at most I just have to get back to ""problem solving"", aka whatever project I concocted lately. There's next to no problem solving in leisure and passive entertainment.

It took me this long to realise what this actually was. I mean, I just thought I was a workaholic and didn't see it as a problem until I started getting stressed about not having things to do. My wife would point out that I was ""doing it again"", but I insisted I had no idea what she was talking about and I truly didn't. Until now, I realise it's an addiction.

The reason I'm posting here is because I just wanted to share with everyone else battling some kind of addiction, whether it's drugs or something else, gaming etc. All the people who just figured out what their addiction is. I'm posting because I'm going to do something about it. I don't really know any other way but to force myself not to follow these thought paths and prevent myself going off activities while forcing myself to relax and enjoy leisure activities again like games, tv, movies, swimming, walking, all sorts of activities which require me to be present in the world and look at something else and not working my brain hard on a project. I'm going to do that for an entire month and see how I feel. Day 1 is already incredibly tough but I'm determined.

it started  years ago. at thirteen, i had my first drink. it was at a bar in tenerife and it was a couple beers. i was petite and young so the alcohol kicked in fast. it fucked me up. i dont remember anything but the feeling of being messed up felt so good. after that, i stopped drinking for 2 years because i was scared of alcohol. i didnt want to get fucked up again. but at 15 i was at a party and i had a sip of vodka and...needless to say, i went overboard and blacked out. i needed it to have fun. 

thats when it began. it started with just drinking with friends, then with the family, then on my own in my room. actually, i'm drinking right now in my room while i write this. i drink about 3-5 shots of vodka 3-4 times a week. i even find myself thinking about drinking if i'm sad. i do it at night alone in my room...it helps me sleep. if i dont drink at night i have suicidal thoughts and cant sleep.

you might be wondering---how can you afford all that booze?

well, my dad owns a bar in our backyard. i sneak out to it when my parents are out or asleep and take a bottle of vodka. my dad bulk buys booze so he doesnt notice. i have a stash in my room. one bottle lasts me about a four days and when i run out i just...make a trip to the bar. 

its either big or go home when i drink. i dont have a limit. i'll drink until i am literally blacking out choking on my own sick. 

i have mental health issues that have been discussed in therapy (went a few years ago because of a family issue) but no diagnosis came out of that. but pretty sure i have depression and anxiety--i dont need a expensive hour for a dickhead to tell me what is obvious.

anyway, i wanna talk to someone about this. i dont see many teenager alcholics.

sidenote: i'm literally studying science at college, have great grades, a pretty good friendgroup and good family...but i'm sick. you dont know what people are going through. in another persons shoes i seem to have a pretty good life...think again.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4693072}"

Porn has also been an addiction since my teen years. Porn has given me low confidence and issues with relationships with women and I'm real sick and tired of it.

Sleep deprivation that tags along with its use has gone out of control. Last week I was up for 6 days, no sleep, fueling myself from the rails and paranoia/psychosis is fucking hell.

Do you know what life is like for a World Trade Center Survivor? Hi, my name is Stevie A. Burke, and I am one of many World Trade Center survivors still struggling with mental and physical illnesses. 

I have never gone into full details about September 11 and life after, so I've decided to blog about it. The night before September 11, I did my regular Monday night thing at Bar 13, reading poetry and snapping my fingers until it was time to head to work. Damn, I miss those nights of giving strangers an in-depth vision of my awkward creative thoughts. So neurotic and erotic on that beautiful late summer night, and by the time I stepped outside, the vibe had released me into a world where my vision was no longer blurred. 

I showed up around 11:30 PM to work my 12 AM to 8 AM shift as the Security Supervisor for Instinet. Instinet was located on the 12th, 13th, and 14 floors of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The night went by fast as per - let's face it, this was a cakewalk job for someone like me. The pay was fantastic, and I got to do a lot of studying for the web design course I was taking. At 7:30 AM, my coworker Eric showed up all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. At 7:45 AM, the secretary, Adriana, called to say that she would be running late for our weekly meeting. This phone call was significant because she, the office manager, Walter, and I would meet for about 5 minutes once a week. The discussions never went over, so I didn't mind waiting at all.

I sat in the office as Eric did his patrol, he starting with the 14th, then the 13th, and finally down to the 12th floor. He must have been on the 12th floor for two minutes when the Big Bang happened.

The building started swaying like a wave pool at a waterpark. My first thought was that it's an earthquake. It felt like an earthquake, so I jumped out of my chair and stood up in the doorway. Soon after the rocking stopped, Eric came rushing out of the door across from the office, but he wasn't alone. It seemed like he brought the whole 12th floor with him. Everyone was panicking and frantic, giving me the *what is happening* face. I, at the time, had no idea what was going on. I picked up the phone to call the fire marshal, but there wasn't an answer. I then jumped to the next course of action, which was to evacuate all three floors. I told everyone to grab their stuff and start heading downstairs. I ordered Eric, who was still rightfully shell shocked, to clear the 14th and 13th floors. After I double-checked the 12th, I tried calling the Fire Marshal back but still had no luck. When Eric got back to the 12th floor, most Instinet workers started coming back upstairs, stating that the Fire Marshal said it was just a fire on the upper floors. I thought we were all in the clear for a second, so I decided to call my mother to let her know what was happening. Good thing because she said that a plane had struck the building and another was about to hit the. ""Get, your ass home"" was how that conversation ended, ""Okay ma,"" I assured her.

Eric and I started the evacuation process again but in reverse. I checked the 14th and then the 13th floor, and Eric contained the 12th. By the time I got back to the 12th floor, Eric and Walter were helping a few firefighters take their gear off, so I joined in. They took a brief five-minute break to drink water, we helped them put their heavy ass gear back on, and up they went.

Finally, it was time to leave. The stairwell was quiet by then, and when we got to the 7th floor, we found two old ladies struggling to go down the stairs. At that point, it wasn't in us to leave them, so we offered to help. ""We'll walk with you,"" Walter said. The door from the stairwell to the main entrance felt like it would take hours to get to, and the closer we got to it felt more peaceful. I will never forget the moment we finally reached outside. My emotions were mixed, especially since a few Instinet employees were still hanging around. I said my goodbyes and started walking towards the Church. Eric and Walter followed, and after seconds of standing in front of the Church, it sounded like a bomb was dropping in one of those old war movies. I looked up and saw the building falling, so I yelled, ""Run!""

We all started running away from the World Trade Center buildings. The morning just kept on getting harder and harder, but I knew I had to stay attached to both Walther and Eric. Walter was in his mid-60s, and Eric wasn't fleet of foot. They were out of breath when they stopped running, but we were safe. After we dusted ourselves off, we game-planned what we would do next. Eric suggested we go to his grandmother's apartment. Luckily she lived close by, because I had enough excitement for one day. Each step to Eric's grandmother's apartment, my legs got heavier. My nerves were finally catching up to me, the chain of events still unclear, and a sense of hopelessness started to hit the air.

Eric's knock on his grandmother's door was far from subtle, and the embracing exchange seemed like it gave him a sense of security. Even though I felt welcomed, I still didn't feel safe because I was still in the city. Walter stayed two hours before he left. That was the last time I saw Walter, but I know he made it home safe. Eric had no plans on leaving his grandmother's apartment, and I had to wait until I heard it was okay to attempt to get home. I lived in East New York at the time, so I had to walk over the bridge to get the train to get home. I got to the bridge at 4:10 PM. By then, my heart had been racing since 8:46 AM. Now, this is the perfect segue to my first of many World Trade Center health-related conditions.

(*If you or someone you know was directly impacted by the World Trade Center attack,* [*The WTC Health Program*](https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/) *is still accepting applications* [*https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/*](https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/))

My first encounter with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was months after the attack. I woke up in the middle of the night feeling cold, yet I was soaked in sweat. I woke up because I had a dream that the building was once again falling on me. Almost every night after, I relived different moments of September 11, and each night I lost sleep. A few years later, I started to get easily irritated, and it didn't matter who or what the problem was; it seemed to be ten times bigger. I never paid any attention to any mental illnesses before September 11, so I had no idea what I was going through. There were periods where I didn't leave my room for days. I didn't want to be around people, not even my ex-wife and kids.

(*There is hope for PTSD. Find more information on symptoms and treatment* [*here*](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967)*.)*

Anxiety attacks were next on the list to rear their ugly head. No matter where I go, my body is in survival mode. When I step into any room, I locate the exits, and then I come up with a million reasons I would have to go flying out of them. Then came survivor's remorse and suicidal thoughts. Suicidal thoughts are the hardest thing to explain. I sometimes feel like I don't belong or nobody understands what I am going through. I tried therapy for years, and for the most part, they all started the same way. As soon as I say I am a World Trade Center survivor, most would tell me where they were when I happened. At that point, I stop listening, sorry I am not here for you. Plus, if there were one place a person is allowed to be narcissistic, I would think it would be at therapy. I tried all kinds of pills to combat my mental health problems, and none seem like they work. In 2013, I started using alcohol to sleep, and I would drink until I couldn't remember anything.

Although I was no longer losing sleep, I was now losing my loved ones. Substance abuse put a giant wall between my nightmares and my reality. It took a few years to realize I was addicted to escaping my feelings before I checked myself into Seafield drug and alcohol rehabilitation. By November 2016, I had become a shell of what used to be a man, self-destructed and self-inflicted.

📷 

*The best decision I ever made was to begin my recovery journey.*

I met many incredible people in rehab, but Chris and Matt stood out the most. Chris was a retired NYPD sergeant battling drug addiction, and he was also at the World Trade Center when the attack happened. That was the first time I spoke to someone who was also there. Instantly we formed a bond. He told me about many things the government was offering to survivors. However, health care was the one that stuck out the most. I paid 20% of my rehab, but the World Trade Center Health Program completely covered his. It was the first thing I Googled after I left Seafield, and it wasn't just the free medical coverage that intrigued me.

I needed to be around more people like Chris, more survivors, and doctors who knew what I was going through. While at Seafield, I participated in every activity and workshop. I met Matt playing chess. Believe me, I am no Bobby Fisher, but to everyone there, I was. I played chess with Matt once a day, and although he was younger, he was astute. The games were intense yet relaxing, probably because we spent most of the time talking about life after drugs and alcohol. Matt was battling drug addiction, and this was his second time in an inpatient rehab facility. Therefore his voice echoed, echoed, ""I can't do this again,"" while mine was all about the one and done.

Our most memorable conversation happened during a game of pool. Matt asked, ""Do you have a ten-year plan?"" 

I responded, ""Yes. Yes, I do have a ten-year plan. But, first, I want to develop a social media application for sober people.""

Matt's eyes lit up with excitement, ""Oh, that's a great idea."" ""Can I help? I can help."" He started to get more persistent, ""My dad is a developer. I can get him to help.""

""No thanks, but I'll think about it,"" I responded.

The conversation ended, and we never spoke about it again until three weeks after we were both out of rehab. By late December, he had convinced me to share more information. So I took him down the rabbit hole called Substance Glorification, and before long, we were brainstorming a landing page. This moment felt like a Godsend because we both wanted to make a difference, but Matt started using again and ended up in the hospital a month after. When I picked him up from the hospital, we spoke about everything but his overdose.

""You wanna crash at my place?"" I offered.

""Nah, take me home, please. I have to talk to my girl even though she'll probably kick me out,"" he said. She did kick him out, but Matt knew the consequences of his actions.

He stayed at some run-down motel in Ronkonkoma, New York, for a while. We met up again on Super Bowl Sunday to watch the game. I didn't think it would be the last time I saw him. We ate, played pool, and laughed. After the game, I gave him a few bucks to cover his stay for a week at the motel, and I went home. The following morning, I got a call from his girlfriend saying that he died from an overdose. When Matt died, I had only known him for three months, yet it felt like I just lost my right hand. His death was the equivalent of losing someone I had known for a lifetime, mainly because I put some of the blame on my shoulders. Maybe I made the mistake of giving him money instead of paying for the room myself. Perhaps I should've forced him to stay at my place so I could watch him. I went through all the maybes until I concluded that it wasn't my fault. Matt's death led me to start researching anything related to Substance Abuse and how I could prevent others from dying.

*My sobriety has allowed me to have healthy relationships with my amazing kids.*

There comes the point and time where we all have to speak in our narrative tongue to share our stories to help others. The last twenty years of my life were far from beautiful, but I've managed to get medical attention for my mental and physical health, and I'm still working on developing apps with fewer triggers. I believe apps with fewer triggers will lead to fewer relapses and a more positive outcome. I hope reading this makes you a little more empathetic about people suffering from mental health problems.

turn into a depressed and socially anxious teenager/young adult

Anyway, i finally got my shit together 2 years ago when I found out I was pregnant. I managed to get clean cold turkey and have maintained my sobriety since. It's been challenging at times but thanks to COVID I haven't had any real temptations so it's actually been ok. Anyway, I've been on antidepressant/anxiety medication for a few years, I'm seeing a therapist once a week (honestly don't know how I would do without it). I have to see a psychiatrist once in a while to get my meds prescription in order. I HATE those mfs. I had to change several times because I honestly believe those doctors are all actual sociopaths. The one I was referred to when I first got pregnant and needed to adjust my meds etc, told me that she didn't believe i got sober on my own and that it was impossible that I actually was not using anymore. (spoiler alert : I ditched that bitch)

The one I'm seeing now, I thought was actually a good one because he was actually listening to me. But yesterday I had a session with him and he told me ""Well stop being so hard on yourself, have a damn drink ! You're not an addict. You just were partying a bit too much like all young adults !""

FUCK THE FUCK OFF WITH THAT BULLSHIT. Those people are criminals. I got out of that session actually wondering if maybe he was right and maybe I COULD have that damn drink and be okay. 

This is dangerous shit right there. I know in my heart and soul that I'm an addict and an alcoholic, and I've never in my life been able to drink in moderation or had an appropriate response to being inebriated. I've lost so much in my life because of that poison and now I have a 16 mo child whom I love more than anything and anyone in the whole world and would never wish to do anything to jeopardize that relationship.

Why would you try to use drugs? To be cool? To be valid to your peers who are also using? or maybe just curious? Whatever your reason maybe it's b\*llshit!

Addiction is destructive, not only to you but also to people around you - your family, friends, children. As kids we were always hopeful growing up - we always look forward to the good things. Maybe the experiences that you've  had growing up led to you using drugs. Maybe you've been hurt, you've been rejected, you've been downed a lot of time that you can no longer bare it and you just wanted to escape the cruelty and feel different. That's totally understandable. But why drugs? Is there no other option to get away from it?

If you are a parent, have you thought abut your children who will grow up in fear? Addiction will not only affect you, it will do harm to them the most. As a child, how would you feel about your parents crying, questioning what they've done wrong as parents? You are breaking the hearts of those people who cherish you?

You can try to hide addiction but it will eventually show. Addiction will drown you and drag you to the ocean floor where the sunlight is no longer seen. Addiction is a heartbreaker that would promise you happiness but would desert you when you've fallen deep for it. It will make you happy at first and then leave you high and dry and guilty. Addiction is a manipulator with all the bad intentions.

There are many rehab centers that can help you heal and achieve sobriety. Remember the inner child in you. You are happy always looking for the bright side of things. Live it.

6. Our team was close... we appropriately teased, joked with eachother from time to time.
7. My wife was frequently in the hospital and I was utilizing my government regulated ""family days"".
8. Gambling habit was increasing...
9. 1 day the boss made racial and religious jabs at me.
10. I decided to move past it and let it be part of the past.
11. My boss decided he had, had enough of me missing work days (Because he would have to pick up the slack). 
12. My boss made an entire case out of me not wanting to work or be part of the team. and out of my ""absenteeism"". I was sent home, written up, and worked unpaid.

20. I was interviewed by a professional (Took 5-6 months to set up the appointment) with a professional psycholotrist. 
21. Gambling addiction was getting out of hand.
22. The doc. wrote a report.... I got a copy of it. I was not considered harmful or a risky/dangerous individual... Also the doc. did not understand why my co-workers were not interviewed (About me being potentially dangerous)...

He took his own life, which was completely out of the blue and I never in a million years would have thought that my husband was capable of leaving this world by taking his own life. Luke and I were happily married soul mates, who met at school in 1992, with two beautiful children together.

Nothing quite prepares you for losing your husband to suicide. As time passes, it doesn't get easier. I want really hope that one day others will be protected in a way that Luke was not. #LukesLaw is my way of showing what could be done.

[#Luke'sLaw ](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/587806)

Luke, had been furloughed at the end of October and developed a gambling disorder, which quickly got out of control. He ended up in debt and was probably very scared about how he was going to pay it back. He took his life 22nd April 2021.

I had no idea that Luke had been betting until 3 weeks after Luke's death when the police gave me his phone back. It quickly became very apparent that he was consumed, and knowing Luke, he wouldn't have not known how to tell me.

I have set up a petition asking the government to ban 'free bets', which are not free and can be extremely harmful to someone like my husband who shouldn't have had them offered to him at a time when he was furloughed and worrying about money.

Could you please sign and share #LukesLaw petition to help raise awareness as well as get this important issue of gambling inducements raised in parliament. It really needs to be debated with the possibility of law changing to help protect others from gambling harm and gambling related suicide.

i went to rehab when i was 18 and after fucking up for a few months after, and with the help of suboxone and NA i managed to get clean and sober and stayed that way for 6 years. in the years preceding this i was a teenage alcoholic and then went onto becoming a heroin addict. obviously this was an extremely painful time for my friends and absolutely devastated my parents.

in my time being clean and sober i realized how emotionally enmeshed and codependent my parents and i are. they have no friends and my happiness is their happiness and my downfalls are their downfalls. they put an insane amount of pressure on me, not in the sense of achieving but in the sense that if i’m not well i know it’ll absolutely destroy them and as a result, i feel a great deal of responsibility for their feelings. i obviously know this isn’t healthy but that’s my point: i need help

so as of last year, i made the active decision to start drinking and using casually. i don’t know if it’s because i got clean so young or dealt with a lot of my trauma or what, but so far i’ve been able to keep it casual and when ive felt it verge on addictive i’ve been able to take a break. it’s probably not ideal but it’s ok for right now. i’m not hurting, my friends know and support me, and i haven’t hurt anyone. 

where it gets tricky is the immense guilt i feel whenever i think of my parents... to absolve some of my guilt i told them “i had one beer a couple months ago” and that alone sent them over the edge - constantly checking on me, calling all the time, frequently worries etc.... and even now when my drug/alcohol consumption is quite small and very manageable i am overwhelmed with the shame of being a “bad daughter” or feeling “dirty” when i think of my parents. i know rationally these things are untrue.

i guess my question is how do i maintain and embody the belief that my recovery isn’t destroyed and i’m not a bad person/daughter for using in a way that isn’t harmful to myself or others? further, what can i do when these feelings come up? i really want to be able to reconcile using in a responsible way and truly knowing i am not responsible for my parents well being.

tldr: i used after 6 years of being clean and am dealing with tremendous shame for disappointing my parents",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6559267}"

I’ve been on the same dose of Vyvanse since I was a teenager (currently late 20’s F) and recently weaned off of suboxone after being addicted to opiates for years.

2021-09-01 13:10:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/pfybm7/partner_of_someone_struggling_with_addiction/,partner of someone struggling with addiction," Hi, so it’s my first time on this sub, but I really need some guidance. My boyfriend has been addicted to opioids twice in his life. For a short period before we met four years ago. And recently fall 2019-spring 2021. Mostly pills, and the volume depended on how much he could get (and a shoulder surgery fall 2020 made us all feel bad for him and in hindsight we should have been more careful about it) 

But then came Kratom, at the beginning of 2021, which spiraled into an addiction of that taking up to 70grams a day of powder. He went to a rehab where they got him off of it, but they used Suboxone(S) to help which is an amazing drug, but has its own drawbacks and terrible withdrawal symptoms. He left the place before they got him off the S, which led to months of him tapering and re-upping it, until he completely ran out, without a way to get more. He completely detoxed from it the first week of august in New Jersey where kratom isn’t legal and he couldn’t go out and buy it. And it was like he was clean…for a short period of time. As soon we got home to New York he went out and bought Kratom. So we went out on Long Island another place it’s rare to find Kratom (but not illegal), but he still managed to go buy some from a smoke shop on a native american reserve! So now I’ve been tasked with taking his phone, his cards, everything. But yesterday he searched through my drawers and closet for cash- found $30 and spent it on you guessed it Kratom- and a cappuccino, that detail made me laugh. The past four days he’s lapsed staring with the last day of our Long Island attempt of getting him away from it. 

I know he’s doing something incredibly difficult, and he’s trying, and I’ve never been truly addicted to anything so I don’t know what it’s like- but from my own research I know that the constant thoughts make it so difficult. And I know that his dopamine levels in his brain are all messed up and not there and he’s trying to take the drugs to feel something. But it’s been almost two years of this. And I don’t want to make his addiction about me, but I’ve also had plenty of personal issues and misfortunes of my own—It’s hard to be strong for him when I can barley be strong for myself. 

This came out longer than I expected or wanted it to be. But i don’t have anyone to talk to about it cause I don’t want anyone to know that my partner is struggling with addiction. With a powdered substance they’ve never even heard of. And even if I did- and when I have a little- they really don’t get it. No one in my life has dealt with addiction. While I’m happy that means I’ll be able to help the people I love if they ever encounter it, it means that right now I am alone with this. He needs me to help, but expresses that I dont understand, that I’m not being helpful, but I dont know what to do, I’m doing what I can while also trying to keep myself together. Existing is hard right now. 

Also before anyone comes after me in defense of Kratom - I have to say that for a while I believed it too, it was much better than him getting oxys, I know that a lot of people can actually use it to get off of what we think of as more serious opioids. I thought it was totally okay and healthy for him, and part of me still knows that it is, if done the right way in moderation (like how Indonesian people traditionally use it) - but my guy doesn’t know the definition of moderation. Also looking online you can’t really find too much information about it being a health risk. So its harmless right? It can be for some people, but not all. Take it at your own risk, but if you’re someone who struggles with addictive substances my advice is to not go there. But all things considered, I wish it was illegal in the states haha",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46477178}"

I moved cities a little over 7 months ago. I’ve definitely struggled with alcohol in the past, but because I was home and around a stable support system, I was always able to pull myself out of it. 

Since moving I slowly began to lose touch with reality. I have friends out here, but they all have their own lives to focus on so most of the time I feel very alone when coping with my emotions. This feeling of loneliness has pushed me to a state of drinking I’ve never been in before. I haven’t gone a day without drinking in well over 4 months now. 

At first it started off with only a couple of beers a night. I try to avoid all other alcohol because I tend to over consume wine and liquor. Unfortunately, alcohol is alcohol, and the over-consumption bug has finally caught up to me again. 

I have experimented with different substances but only months apart and in moderation. The other night I drank the most I’ve drank in a long time, wound up at a house I’m not familiar with, and ended up taking 5 caps of MDMA. I snorted some of the capsules which I’ve never done before, in the past I’ve only swallowed them.
