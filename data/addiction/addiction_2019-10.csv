2019-10-30 14:27:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/dpamze/loving_him_losing_me/,Loving Him & Losing Me,"We’ve been together for almost 3 years. This man and I grew up together since we were children; we know the ins and outs of one another’s heart. Long story short, he’s been battling an opiate addiction the majority of the time we’ve been together. 
After abusing IV fentanyl/heroin and speedballing for so long, he hit rock bottom. We all did. He was having seizures, blacking out, suicidal, verbally abusive, and everything in between. He stole everything his parents and I owned so that he could pawn it and have money for his fix. Finally, he went to rehab in March for the first time, but he decided to leave early a few days before completing a 30 day program. Even though I wanted him to stay, I brought him home and supported his decision. It didn’t take long, about 3 weeks, before sketchy behavior began all over again. Being MIA for a few days, not coming home, not answering the phone,  he was drinking every night trying to fill this void he was feeling. 
That was the first time I left. We were apart for 3 months, then I called him to check on him. He claimed to be sober, and we started hanging out. Eventually, I moved back in with him and we decided to start over. About a month passed, and then I found the needles. I found the small bags with residue. I found the cotton balls he had soaked and was saving them to try to use later. It broke my heart. 
I laid the needles out on the floor along with the drug bags and cotton balls, then I found him in the living room digging through his backpack searching for something. “Missing something?” I mumbled with tears in my eyes. He looked at me with desperation, and I swear he looked like a ghost. I showed him what I had found, and he broke down. He hated himself, and he wanted to get clean. I took him to his doctor, and he got back on Suboxone. We talked for a long time, and he decided this time was IT. He was going to stay clean for good. (Easier said than done) I always told myself I wouldn’t put myself through all of this again, but I couldn’t leave him to battle this on his own. So I stayed and supported him through his relapse. 
He was clean for a few weeks again. Then all of my walls came crashing down. My debit card had all types of ATM withdrawals. Things were missing. He was losing weight so quickly, he looked like a skeleton. How did we get here again?? I tried confronting him several times, but that turned into a screaming fight and I was just being a “bitch”. I couldn’t believe I was living with this again... 
I packed my things and left. Again. A week went by, and he wouldn’t stop blowing me up. I finally answered, and I told him we couldn’t be together like this. He needed help, and I had to keep my distance to protect my soul (and my belongings & bank account). He still swore he wasn’t using, and I was just making up things in my head. Well, he got kicked out of his place and had to move back in with his parents. Then his parents started having their things disappear. Money missing. Pawn tickets crumpled up in the trash. I came over I’ve evening to discuss things with him and his parents, and he finally broke down to us. Of course, he was using and needed help. This was an entire new rock bottom. 
Being stuck in addiction is like being possessed by a demon. You have no control over your body, your mind, or your choices. I watched  him slowly kill himself over the years, and I thought I could help him by loving him harder. Then I realized that the more I loved him, the harder I tried to help him overcome these demons, the less I loved myself. I was drained physically, emotionally, and spiritually. 
He went back in to rehab yesterday, and I’m so proud he made that step. I know that we all have some serious healing to do after all of this. Half of me is being steered in a new direction. Move on. Focus on my dreams. Focus on my career. Focus on bettering myself so that I can help others. However, the other half of me still wants him. I am not as co-dependent as I was before, but I can’t seem to just let him go. That half wants to wait for him. That half wants to support him, love him, and be with him forever through it all. Perhaps I can only love and support him from a distance though. 
I know this is such a long post, but I could really use some direction, tips, or advice. Thank you for reading.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.597923}"

It is not a lot of time but after years of not even seeing the possibility of being clean this finally means I'm turning my life around. I know there might be relapses and things won't always be easy but right now I love the way I live and I have no intention of going back. 

I wish I could throw a party and yell and tell the whole world how happy I am of this little goal but most of my friends don't even know I've been an addict, so I'll just celebrate with some internet strangers. If you guys are recovering too, from drugs, mental health conditions, or anything, I wish you the best of luck. I wish I could give a special hug to who, like me, just started this new life and is scared that anything could go wrong. Recovery is not only when you succeed to stay clean: the first and most important step is realizing what the problem is and do something to change it. 

Love yourself. Stay safe and stay clean ♥️

Edit: thank you guys, even a little bit of random appreciation from the internet made my day! I got clean thanks to a very special person, but unfortunately he is not here to see it with his own eyes.

Last year even I could go months without using and my drug use was fun, short term and moderately contained. Now I am fucking high on fentanyl all the goddamn time.
I have tried to stop but withdrawal is so fucked I slip back in after a day or two to stop the pain and goddamn restless legs.
I want to stop but life without opioids has become poison to my mind.
I saw Joker with my dad and brother today and in the early parts of the movie when he is walking around depressed as fuck in the grimy shit covered violent fuck fest of a city it reminded me of how I feel about my life on the days when I try to be sober.
This is insane because I have a dream of a life, I have two wonderful young children I live in one of the most beautiful towns you can find, I have a very nice home and my financial future is set unless I fuck it up with my addiction.

But none of it matters I can be sober and have all the wonderful things I have in my life and it makes me want to die, or I can be high and it doesn’t matter what is going wrong I’m “happy”.

I fucking hate myself like this, I want so badly to never touch drugs again, but I don’t fucking know how, I tell myself I’m going to taper down and work toward sobriety and so this week I spent $1.125 on pills with the promise that it was for the purpose of working my way down, but here I am four days later and I’ve taken half the shit that was supposed to be my month taper. And so now I’m here trying not to cry writing this pitiful story while high as fuck at midnight, I need to be up in 6 hours so I can work a long day tomorrow but here I am high as fuck so I’ll be hung over as fuck and doing a shit job tomorrow.
I often go to bed so high I worry about my wife waking up to my corpse, and that more than anything makes me fucking hate myself, I am an addict and I know that death is a good possibility in that lifestyle but my children waking up to their mother screaming about their cold dead father breaks my heart and pushes me further toward a desperate desire for sobriety than anything else, but I am an addict and a piece of shit and even though I know I would not just kill myself but ruin their lives as well I go back every fucking day.

Today makes two years for me. I never, ever, in a million years, thought I would be able to say that. Never thought I'd be strung out on heroin and cocaine either, but here we are. My trip through hell all started with a percocet and a cute boy that told me I'd really like it. To this day, I don't blame him because I made my own choices but that is where it started. Within a month of trying opiates for the first time, I was traveling out of state to buy heroin and selling it to support our habit. Life felt unreal. I felt untouchable. Until I got arrested with 200 tickets crossing state lines. 

I remember SO VIVIDLY the DEA agent telling me, ""Someday you will thank me. I probably saved your life."" And he was right.  So, thank you, Tony Milligan from Maine DEA for possibly saving my life. Sorry for puking in your car. I did not get the drugs from your wife (obviously) like I said I did and you can unfuck yourself now. You did save my life.

I did 14 months in prison, have 5 years hanging and 4 years probation. I have class A, B, and C felonies on my record but I wouldn't change a single thing. Because I'm alive. I'm in a healthy relationship. I don't wake up sick anymore. My first thought in conflict is no longer getting fucked up. 

I know there is a huge debate on incarcerating drug addicts and I 100% agree that it shouldn't be the answer in fighting addiction; but nothing else would have gotten me clean. I had tried rehabs, IOP, 12 step meetings, suboxone. My brain was sick and the only thing that gave me relief was being locked up. They say it's jails, institutions or death. Prison got me clean; plain and simple.

“Addiction” is when you want to **quit** intoxicating yourself and you want to **continue** intoxicating yourself at the same time. 

The only reason anyone can’t simply choose to quit is because part of them does not want to quit. 

Your struggles with addiction are OVER once you overcome the ambivalence and fully commit to a decision to quit. 

People don’t choose to feel ambivalent, but they can choose to overcome ambivalence by committing to a decision. 

Many people in the recovery community would have you believe that, as an “addict,” you are a weak, helpless baby with some sort of handicap that renders you incapable of committing yourself to a decision to do what is best for yourself, and your life, and your family, and your community, in the long run.

Quit opiates many years ago, then went back and forth with Kratom, then a few years ago took Adderall and liked how productive I became (and how it took my mind off my negative thinking). I never got too crazy with it (never skipped sleeping or anything like that) but because it only worked for 2 hours or so I would have to take extra doses sometimes.

Last couple of years I've been realizing how much time I'm wasting thinking/looking for ""crutches"" all the time instead of just enjoying the moment. It is a repeating pattern of using a crutch, feeling better, realizing I shouldn't be using something, trying to quit, taking a few days off, then starting up again. It's hard to stop fully since some days my mind keeps telling myself ""man it's so nice outside, how much nicer would it be if you could stop worrying about stuff also, just take some kratom or some adderall, etc"".

Anyways recently I've stopped everything for the greater part of 17 days or so (I slipped maybe 3 days out of that 17 days where I took a low dosage of Adderall). I notice the biggest trigger is just feeling so unproductive, then feeling guilty about being unproductive, then feeling like maybe just today I should take something so I can be more productive, etc. I take something, get a lot done, happy about that, then feel guilty that I broke my streak. I'm self-employed so being at home it's easy to ride it out, but also easy to feel lazy. Then sometimes feel like maybe overthinking and taking some periodically is fine. I don't know just wanted to see if others experience anything like this and how they deal with it? If it makes a difference I even stopped drinking caffeine (aside from just green tea or something) to try and eliminate that as a crutch also.

Any advice or your own struggles/what helped you would be very much appreciated...also, I have a coworker at my job that I've talked to about some of my drug issues so he knows about it...ive been wanting to send him a screen shot about addiction and just ask if I should go to rehab...

All I know is I'm really getting fucking tired of being in this god damn cycle of no more drugs, okay some drugs but then no more after this time...I'm scared it's getting out of control....my mental health is suffering too...work is stressful I don't know if it's the drugs or just lately I've been trying to get people working and they don't listen and i don't know how to deal with the stress of that either lol fuck im a mess...


I think I need to go to rehab....but I honestly don't even know what rehab is or means I'm too afraid to call those numbers I don't want to call the wrong one and it not work for me...

P.s. I don't really believe in God, I'm agnostic and I don't know about surrendering to a higher power... But I'm at my wit's end and I know something's gotta change...also I've been feeling like shit physically more lately..I don't think it's opiate (physical) withdrawal or anything...probably need to see a doctor to see if I have diabetes....

2019-10-27 18:32:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/do06zq/im_worried_and_scared_for_my_big_brother_now_hes/,I'm worried and scared for my big brother now he's out of rehab again,"My brother is 34 and has been dabbling here and there for years, I wasn't aware of the severity of his addiction until the last two years when he began to try killing himself with heroin. He and his girlfriend broke up and he wanted to spite her, so he tried to off himself with heroin and in a tragic twist, his failure to die left an intense, world shattering addiction. My brother says he didn't touch heroin until two years ago when the whole mess started but he was using pain pills. These two years have been absolute hell on me and my family, he moved into our house and we hadn't known what he was doing, that he was actively shooting up heroin whatever chance he got. The first few overdoses were terrifying and I never knew anything about CPR, Narcan and 911 until then. Bless my neighbor for gifting us the Narcan, we always have the stuff in the house, its a life saver.

He's been in and out of rehabs more times than I can count anymore, my brother has never been clean longer than 40 days \[I'm being generous because he swears its longer than half a month\], and that is only when he's on his vivitrol shot. He can't seem to stay clean without it yet he fights us tooth and nail that he doesn't want it, that he can tough it out and prove that he can do it. He never has, he always relapses, no matter what post!support group he has. He always weakens and I find him on the floor somewhere or find out he snuck out with the car to buy/use in private outside the home. I haven't slept at all because I was always playing watchdog to make sure he couldn't take the car or somehow die during the night because he was sneaky enough to bring more drugs into the house.

Recently, he ODed three times earlier this October in one week. My sanity is at its breaking point and after literally overdosing on the way to detox and rehab, he seems to finally admit he needs more intensive care than he's gotten. So he's finished rehab again about two days ago now and is living in a sort of sober house \[he will be going into a legit sober house once the program deems him strong enough\], he is montiered all times of the day and can't go anywhere unless supervised by a staff member. He is also on his shot again. I'm glad he's trying this sober living housing stuff but I am still deeply frightened and traumatized he will use again eventually and just... die, because he's not at home where I can do something for him and call 911. There were many times we used the family phone tracker to hunt him down when he would vanish hours on end, we've found him arrested or screwed up many times.

Even though my mental health is ruined \[I have extreme anxiety, flashbacks and nightmares about all the stuff I've witnessed these two years trying to save him\], I love him and want him to be safe and healthy. I want to see him make it, heaven above if I could plead with some higher deity I would swap places with him just so he can finally be at peace from his addiction. I don't wanna bury him, I couldn't bear the thought but everyday that passes I am frightened of someday getting that phone call. Even where he is now, I have mental flashes of finding out he died there or something because someone wasn't on him enough. I'm so nervous tonight I could puke, we are allowed to call him but then I fear it going straight to voicemail or the text never being replied to. He was supposed to call last night and I haven't heard anything yet, I hate how even with him in a safe monitered place I can't relax. My nerves are taut and the PTSD just doesn't go away.

I'm sorry to be so venty but just... I'm so tired and afraid for my big brother, he's been my hero all my life and I wish he would get better. We used to be so close and the best of friends, now though I feel like I don't know him anymore and all I'm doing is trying to keep a memory alive that died the moment he touched the heroin. Everything feels like a nightmare that never ends. Even if he does get clean, I begin to fear the future further for when someday mom dies, I know he wouldn't be able to handle it and if he died so soon after mom in this future... Oh lord I'm hurting bad. I can't even tell him the dog died because I'm worried what if he uses it as a reason to use, the poor thing died literally the night after he went to rehab \[its my dog but they were close\]. I've gone off the tangent now, ugh. I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for me so I can find some peace and help my brother.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.79774845}"

Most days I hold myself over by smoking weed all day. Once weed is not enough, drinking is next, effectively numbing all the pain from the previous days of suffering. But once the craving comes, it hits like a train, and weed or alcohol will not do it for me. I need cocaine. I need it now. I need it 10 minutes ago. I shouldn’t. Who cares? No, I don’t want to lose my progress. No, I’ll start tomorrow.

I just woke up for the day, still drunk and throwing up from last night. Oh last night. The night that I smoked all of my weed in a feeble attempt to hold myself over. The night that I drank all the alcohol I had because I couldn’t find a way to cope. The night when my boyfriend flushed all of my cocaine down the toilet and I sobbed uncontrollably for an hour straight.
And now today, a new day. A day free of any substances in my house. A day where I am faced with the decision to “reup”, and retreat back to my toxic cycle of substance abuse, or let this be my “new beginning”, and take the events of last night as a blessing.
I can’t keep living this way. Always either sick, shitfaced, or both....I am scared for my job. I am scared for my boyfriend. I am scared for my home. I am scared for myself.

ABHS Spokane Washington: 2 times

   surrounded by criminals using drugs, sneaking drugs, seeking out drugs etc. They were violent and I was often harassed for my sexual orientation and for my refusal to interact out of fear.

   The staff and council were hardly there at all and most groups were run by patients themselves. Maybe one day a week with a councilor if I was lucky. 

DAPC Rose valley Washington: 3 times 

1 on 1 council only once a week. 

Surrounded by criminals once again. Same issues. 

Also i was sexually harassed by my councilor while giving a urine analysis. 

Mountain Ministries, Rose valley washington: 1 time

forced to do hard labor everyday.

Forced to go to church everyday.

Sexual harassment and criminal activity.

No 1 on 1 or any council at all. 

   These are only a few stories and I've been to several other treatment centers. I want to go one last time and want to ask my family for help and get into a place that cares for me better. 

   Alot of people say it doesn't matter where i go if i want it it will work. I say bullshit. 

   I was thinking betty ford or something with a lot of 1 on 1 and individualized treatment and a healthy diet for me to eat. Maybe a place with less criminal activity where im treated a little better. More comfort.

After 8 times of going through withdrawals (including having seizures and almost dying), fucking up my life and car, and being near losing my job, I finally realized that I needed help. I went to 33 days of inpatient treatment from June to July, got out and relapsed being back at home, went BACK to inpatient for 11 days, and moved into sober living. Now I’m at 3 months and I’m getting my health, personality, mind, and life back.

So very thankful and grateful that I got into treatment in time, have supportive family & friends, a job, a place to live, and my dignity back. 

Fuck alcohol/drugs and the devastating hold they have on addicts. Be supportive of others and kind to yourself during this difficult process. Remember: progress, not perfection.

I have a lead for a house/space but obviously a lot more planning would be needed...,"I have a lead for a space/house that could be used for this in San Francisco (in the city itself but more of a residential neighborhood, not a particularly urban part of the city, but close enough to the main public transportation lines to get downtown).

Unfortunately, there are not a lot of accessible MATs (medication assisted treatments) for people recovery from stimulant or the like overuse (cocaine, meth, Adderall, etc.) so I'm trying to plan out an extended period when I can just be abstinent for a long time (like a year), and for me immediate social support (not just going to groups/meetings, but actually living with people I can relate to and are supportive and share similar recovery goals) is essential for sustaining that abstinence. 

I have a lot of potential pieces in place for this, mainly a great lead/opportunity for a place/space/house that could accommodate up to 5 people comfortably and would be financially accessible, even if roommates/members/housemates were unable to be working full-time in order to allocate enough time/energy to their various needed recovery (both physical and mental) commitments, therapies, and such.

I just don't know other people who are at this particular stage of the recovery process and able to collaborate/live together in this supportive model I'm imagining (a big factor being job obligations and also geographic limitations, as many of the few friends I've made dealing with stimulant substance issues live in different regions of the USA or beyond even, and some can't just relocated to San Francisco, even if they would really benefit from the model/vision/lifestyle I have in mind).

I'm looking to more or less begin this journey at the start of the new year in Jan 2020. But I could use help planning, and even with some basic upgrades/improvements that might need to be done to the space to make it function optimally. So I just can't make this happen on my own, even though again I have a great opportunity as far as the actual space/house due to a personal connection and fortunate timing.

I have been asking myself over and over what the deal is for days.

Right now, I have my job, my son is safe and has not witnessed any of this, I have paychecks still getting deposited, have money in the bank, still have my house and car, can pay my bills, and still have the love of my life next to me. 

The only thing I can think of, is that clearly this time I am in a different position than I was last time. I haven't lost it all or hit rock bottom per se. I tried to catch it early. I hated meetings from the get. I hated it all, the step work, sponsor, all that stuff. I have my reasons, but in my gut I loathe the thought of forcing myself to do any of this. I will have to at least hit meetings. 

So, I guess my question is: has anyone had a harder time wanting true sobriety without losing it all? Anyone been in this sort of situation? 

I appreciate anyone sharing their stories or any thoughts.

It is currently my 7th day of cold turkey vyvanse abstinence after a little over a year of use. No promises on it being short.

Background:

Did well in school but never did my homework. Thought I was just lazy. Went to freshman year of college at The University of Alabama and halfway through first semester I could not do homework or study. Lifetime doctor happened to write a Vyvanse 30mg over the phone to me while at school. Took it the next day, and I knew I was addicted. 

I had done lots of very pure white and M from the dark webs but this was better than both. Halfway through that first 30mg script, we talked on the phone and I told it I had no side effects and wasnt feeling it too much anymore and he said take 2 (60mg) and we will talk. Bang. I was done for. I'd wake up at 7, take 60mg, go to the dining hall and eat and drink lots of coffee just as it kicked it and zoooooom.

When 2019 rolled around, a few months of use at 60mg daily later, it slowly stopped hitting me for more than 30 minutes so I'd take 2. Then finish the script early and get some adderall to tide me over. Then, over the summer I worked with a girl who supplied me with free, basically endless focalin. 5mg. Mind you, working at the same place as my mother who manages the building and we work on the shipping/receiving dock.

60mg Vyvanse and throughout the day about 30mg focalin up the nose. A good month of that and then she ran out and so did I. My first 5 days of hellish withrawal while at work. I just shook around on the ground and freaked out all day. After that, she didn't give me anymore, so I used my adderall plug to supplement the vyvanse.

About a month ago, life things spiraled and I said fuck it. With the vyvanse I'd snort 60mg extra adderall everdyay. My mom had my bottle because she knew I was addicted. So, when I got the new bottle I said I'm no longer addicted, I can hold onto it. Lies. She bought it. I had some extra adderall, so I finished that with 120mg Vyvanse the first few days. After the adderall ran out, I just took 250mg Vyvanse in the morning everyday. (The new script was 50mg because my doctor was told by ""someone"" I was taking too many.)

When sleep became impossible a day later, I would do 150mg in the morning, 100mg an hour later, and 50mg 1 hour later. No reason, didn't feel euphoric really, but I just did it too get that mental zoooom all day with coffee paired. In 2 weeks I ate 4 meals, and slept about 4 hours a night if I did sleep. The last 3 days of the script, I took 300mg all at the same time every morning and never felt euphoria. There goes sleep deprivation, malnutrition, and dehydration. 

I quickly fell into stimulant psychosis these last 3 days, hallucinating people and cars when rolling weed in parking lots. I'd hear my name called, people in the house, and the delusional paranoia was absolutely insane. I questioned my mother for an hour straight and attempted to look through her text messages. That finished off the script last friday.

Withdrawal:

Currently day 7. Day 1 was Saturday.

Day 1-

Just tired. Slept a lot. My mom knows I'm going cold turkey so I openly smoke her weed and sleep all day.

Day 2-

Slept well. Woke up around 11 and drank some water. Around 3 pm I felt the body feeling I remembered from last time. It can't be described well by me, I try to compare it to having the flu and your joints ache and your muscles are tight and fatigued. It also has an uncomfortable feeling like restless leg where you feel the unbeatable compulsion to move your leg, all over my body. I begin the groaning and rolling around on my bed moving my whole body this night. I also begin eating about 4000 calories each night.

Days 3 - 5-

These body symptoms escalate each day and become paired with mood swings every 15 minutes from angry to happy I'm done, over to sad I can't take them anymore to hopeless the life things going on outside of the withdrawal will ever work out. I was hospitalized 6 days early 2019 but I would not say I was depressed, just going insane and the psychotic symptoms had not completely worn off still. 

Sleep become shorter, from 11 pm to 5 am and very poor quality. It wa better when I smoked and tried again for a few hours at 9 am. Cravings were very low still. Appetite continued to increase where I was eating about 6000 calories throughout the day in candy and double cheeseburgers. Out of the ordinary for me as I am 165 pounds, 6 feet tall, and train powerlifting when not binging stimulants. 

Day 6-

Yesterday was similar to the previous, but the craving in the morning was horrible. I thought I would die if I didn't have Vyvanse in my life anymore, it gave me confidence and the ability to shunt feelings I didn't want. It would last about an hour and happen before bed as well.

Day 7-

Woke up this morning and the craving was worse. I writhed around in bed at 5 am and groaned for an hour. Then it lightened and I smoke per usual and I'm relaxed. Symptoms seem to be worst in the morning, around 3pm and then before bed at 11pm. Intensity has not decreased in symptoms of withdrawal, but duration and frequency of physical symptoms is going down. 

I committed the first day I ran out and told my doc to not write anymore and gave my mom my credit card. I could get pills if I wanted but I don't remember the contact info for it and it'd be a hassle to get cash. I hope I can get back to life things soon, I haven't been doing life things for a while since stims messed that up too. All I do is sleep, eat, smoke weed, have a few beers when it is really bad, and drink water. Hope this helps or is good info.",25,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48751503}"

After that, it was really about controlling temptation. I had maybe like 10 pills, but over the next couple months, I'd find myself stealing some and asking my friend for some, saying I had a horrible toothache or something, and she'd give me a couple pills and I had enough to get high a couple dozen times. I was then prescribed alprazolam a few months and I abused that a little bit along with the last of the hydrocodone. I basically alternated between using hydrocodone one day and alprazolam the next. I ran out of everything back in May but I found myself craving those things constantly that whole time. It got to the point where I was digging around my room to try and see if I had an extra pills lying around or anything I could get my hands on. I went back to the doctor and got prescribed alprazolam again, on top of bumming a few pills off my friend and next thing I know, it's a month later,I've used up most of my pills. I was prescribed 20 and I'm almost out and I feel irritable and sick when I don't have them. I didn't think I had a problem but if you were to ask me if I could realistically see myself never taking these drugs again, it's extremely painful to consider. Like, I'm panicking because I'm out of what I already have and I'm gonna have to figure out how to get more and it's scary to think about not having it because when I'm not high, I feel lonely and depressed, and I feel ill and I don't want to go through that.

I'm married to woman who is working to recover from alcohol abuse. After years of unsuccessfully trying to curb her tendency to binge drink every night, she finally made the courageous step to stop drinking alcohol completely. I'm incredibly happy and proud of her for this. 

Throughout the last year, we started using cannabis (legally) as a way to help wind down before going to bed. My wife decided that she would continue to use cannabis as a replacement for alcohol. I'm generally in favor of this. My feeling is that on the whole, alcohol is much more destructive to our relationship than weed. 

However, her smoking just seems to become increasingly frequent. It's gotten to the point where more often than not, I come home from work around 5 or 6 and she's already stoned and continues to keep at it until she falls asleep on the couch. 

I want to her to recover in her own way and on her own terms. I'm just started to get tired of being around someone who is always consuming. I want to spend more quality time with her but when she's reaching for the vape pen every few minutes it starts to make my skin crawl. Rather than say something about it, I try to keep my mouth shut because she tends to get defensive. She reminds me that she's only been sober (from alcohol) for two months and to cut her some slack. I can take the point. 

The problem is that I just feel like I'm at my wits end with spending time around addictive behavior. Before I met my wife 4 years ago, I was in a relationship with someone with an eating disorder. At this point, I'd rather spend time with myself, reading a book or practicing music than with someone who is continuously getting high.

What should I do? I know I need to manage my expectations, be supportive and patient. For the sake of my own sanity, I just don't want to be around her if she's getting high. On top of that, I feel that it's unfair for me to judge when I still take a couple of hits before falling asleep. I'd love for any recovering addicts or friends/family of addicts to weigh in.

I'm 20 and have been addicted to cannabis for about 10 months. I used to just smoke before sleeping but now I feel like I need it to get through the day. 

Whenever I'm not high, I feel depressed and very anxious. I originally started smoking to combat an anxiety disorder I have but now the anxiety has become more intense and the only time I don't feel it is when I'm very high. 

It's also effected my dating life. I don't smoke before dates, so when I'm on a date, I feel unfocused and lose my charisma and sense of humor because I'm too distracted by the withdrawal side effects.

The insomnia is my biggest fear when it comes to quitting. I can sometimes make it a night or too without smoking but then I feel so tired from the lack of sleep that I end up giving up because the fatigue lowers my will power. 

Recently my self esteem has also been taking a hit. I used to be very confident and extroverted and was overall happy and satisfied with myself as a person and where my life was heading; but recently I've just started to feel nervous around everyone I think it shows when I communicate with others.

I've made a post in the past detailing my situation, but in short I am a 17 year old student that has recently moved out of my parents and sibling's house to live with my auntie because I was overwhelmed with my parents begging for my school bursary money to fund their heroin addiction. I live more peacefully now but this has not stopped them from calling me daily. You have to understand that they are not aggressive, but their begging quickly revolves to tears at which point it becomes exponentially more difficult to morally say no.

My mother has a horrible wound on her leg that causes her immense pain and the only way she can feel like she is not in hell is with drugs - which of course significantly worsens her health. We have the NHS here, but their efforts are sub-standard, especially since my parents speak very little English. The most they would do is a CAT scan and proscribe some antibiotics. My parents have given up as the cost and hardship of travelling up to hospital usually does not yield help.

I am lost on how I can help them - My brothers are really young (7 and 9) and I want to carve my heart out everytime I send my parents money because I know I am just shortening the time for what seems to inevitable. They are not evil, they are not hateful, they are just *hopeless.*

I am mostly writing this as a way to cope, but if anyone has **any** advice or knows any UK charities or any one I can write to please let me know. My parents have wasted their lives in low-quality housing, ""living"" paycheck-to-paycheck and going to me whenever they are in doubt (which I simply can not supply due to the increasing stress of exams and uni applications). I am doing this for my brothers who I want to have a passable childhood.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8503282}"

And once every few weeks, I end up too far and a whole day is lost getting over spending a morning in the bathroom. 

Today I will find that point where I would spin the top off the rum and I will stare at a wall and scream inside. I will scream until I can not any more. Then I will cry if my body wants to cry. Only then will I think about what I felt. Only then will I think about what it feels like to have feelings. Two thousand years ago; our parents or order siblings would have just told us to go stick our toes in the dirt outside and walk around for a few minutes. Has that message been lost? Is it still useful?  Can we humans still ground properly with all these distractions around us?

\*\*\*

For serious. Our society spends so much time convincing people that they should think and feel at the same time. It is so pervasive in our world that most adults don't know the two can't both happen simultaneously.   


Getting past an emotional thing requires going all the way through it. As soon as the **think** kicks in; the emotion experience is paused. 

We are taught to write notes about what we feel. When someone breaks up with us, we are taught to think about it and send a missive to our best friend about how bad it was, what we feel like, how everything was wrong. Details and thoughts fill our screens and our ears almost every waking moment. It is no wonder that they also crash into our dreams.

There is no dulling the **think**. Not with a bottle, not with a pill. 

A wise person once said the best way to do battle is doing by acting in a way completely different to expectations. Musashi called it ""Mountain and sea changing"". If your enemy expects the mountain. Give them the sea. If your enemy expects the sea. Give them the mountain.  


My enemy on this day is inside my head. It is not the creditors calling about some missed payments. It is not the overwhelming workload at two jobs. It is not my disabled parent.  It is not my wonderful 7 year old son who just needs some attention. And it is not my lovely wife, who is struggling with her own demons and who I've nearly destroyed myself trying to help heal.  It is me. It is the thoughts of those things. 

&#x200B;

On this day; I will let myself feel. I will not spin the top off a bottle and sauce up to make the feelings stop so I can focus on the thinking, on the planning, on the details of how I will try and do everything all at once. I will acknowledge that I need to accept what I feel.

I stumbled across it today and want to give any encouragement or hopefulness to anyone who is struggling with addiction. Long story short I was addicted to hydrocodone, Xanax, and cocaine throughout high school and was arrested a week before my 18th birthday which saved me some serious jail time. I’ve been sober now for 8 years next month, have a wonderful wife, 14 month old, and we recently learned we’re expecting another child. I just started my MBA and seriously I still struggle with my demons, but life is so much better than I could have imagined possible while I was in active addiction. My advice or takeaway from my addiction is to ask yourself if you’re trying to cover something up. For me it was intense anxiety and depression. I still struggle with that to this day, but believe me there are far better ways to deal with these issues than masking them. I workout daily, meditate 30 minutes daily, and go to therapy.

Out of experience i know how big of a step it is to ask for help and that only people that want help CAN  be helped. So i am  optimistic. He has since also told his parents.

So far we dont want to sign him up on no list to be prohibited from places of gambling, because we dont want that information in the wrong hands, plus he has a government job.

Also i suggested that he opens up a second bank account that he would not be able to access via his phone or sth, and the only access would be like a keygen device.  We would set up weekly wire of allowance for food transport cigarettes etc. And should he need an unexpected transaction like rent or car repair, he could make individual transactions with supervision or something. I or his parents would ofc hold on to the keygen device. He is all for this idea.

Both of us were viciously bullied too which may or may not have brought us closer together. She used to play games, watch her favourite show and do fan art... she used to do all these things that made her happy. She used be healthy and beautiful. 

Our lives changed as we got older as we are both 23 years old now. With me having a full time job and living in another town we don’t see each other... almost rarely but kept in contact through messaging. 

She met a man named Marc. I don’t care if anyone can find out who this man is because he destroyed my best friend. My friend is very easily manipulated and I believe it’s because her family did that to her. She constantly gives them money and runs errands for them and has done this for as long as Ive known her. Ei) buy her family cigarettes /everyday/ even though she doesn’t even smoke herself. 

This man gave her meth, fet or any kind of drugs he could get his hands on. He was already an addict himself before he met her and he took her down his spiral. I’ve know her to be someone who picks her skin but since the meth, not only is she completely unrecognizable but her body (including her face) is entirely full of open wounds/sores. That look infected... He never loved her and I believe she was just tool for him to get what he wanted (drugs) She worked full time to pay for his drugs and because she was roped into it, for herself too. 

I can’t stop crying or thinking about her. I’ll always love her and forgive her for what has happened to her because; I know how bad it feels to be guilty about spending hundreds of dollars on a 20 minute high.... I miss her so much. We still talk but I’ve found myself to detach myself emotionally from her and on occasion explain to her about how I feel about this.

Marc ruined my best friend, a beautiful daughter to her wonderful mother, a big sister who was a role model for her kid sister and just a beautiful human being..... 

I guess this is just a vent. I’m not asking any questions or opinions but it feels a little good to talk about this.... thanks for reading. I just... hope she gets better.",1,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5760511}"

2019-10-22 02:05:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/dldnem/he_has_to_want_it/,“He has to want it”,"I’m surprised how much I hear this bullshit, even from other people in recovery. My coworker said it about a young man whose life was once again falling apart because of a relapse. He said he has to want to be sober. What a crock of shit. That poor boy has nonstop thoughts echoing in his head telling him what a piece of shit he is and the drugs are the only way he knows to quiet them.

I told my coworker that if we wanted til he wanted to stop using to get him help, we’d likely be waiting til he died. He said “sometimes that’s just what happened” and I wanted to smack him right in the face.

Hell, sometimes I want to get high a lot more than I want to be sober. But that’s what the tools of recovery are for. They help you abstain even when you’d prefer to use—even when getting high is the thing you want the most in that moment—there are the tools to get you through the craving and continue forward.

Studies show that people who are compelled to go to treatment have similar outcomes to people who self-admit to treatment. These aren’t necessarily people who wanted to quit. All a person needs is a desire for their life to be better and the courage to try something new; just a little spark of faith that there might be a better option. A good treatment provider knows how to fan that flame until it catches and then help the person learn those tools to get thru those times when he’s rather be high without using.

When we relapse, it’s not because we didn’t “want it”—that’s just normal for this category of medical conditions—it’s because we didn’t have the resources to bridge that gap. To all of us out there, who would rather be high sometimes, even a lot of the time, don’t be ashamed. You have the power to do the work and get those tools that’ll get you through it, whether you “want it” or not.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5674167}"

Don't end up like him.,"My Dad (63) has struggled with drug and alcohol addiction his whole life. Today was a particularly bad day. I'm going to share a bit about it. Obviously there's a lot of backstory, but I'm going to skip it to keep things brief.

We have a very strained relationship. Almost every interaction we've had for many years now has been predominately an argument or screaming match. I hate interacting with him even though I love the man for raising me after my mother abandoned us when I was a baby. The last time we spoke was a little over two weeks ago when he told me to go away and said he didn't care if he ever saw me again. He texted me on Sunday asking me if he could borrow money to pay his power bill. He had nothing to say about our fight. Whatever. I had noticed things seemed to be getting worse with him so I told him that I'd give him the money if he agreed to take a drug test. At first he refused and said he'd ""just suffer,"" but eventually he said ok.

So I show up about 15 minutes later with a 5 panel style home testing kit. He's outside waiting for me. I can immediately tell he's drunk. Some people can handle alcohol fine. Not my Dad. He immediately becomes a different person. Totally incoherent. I ask him if he's been drinking, but he denies it and asks me to take him to the store to get some things. I say no, you need to take this test first. He's shocked. ""I didn't know you were bringing a drug test! I can't believe you're doing this to me! This is so disrespectful! I'm not doing drugs!"" He's losing his mind. Saying I'm the worst son possible. Anything hurtful he can think of he's saying it. I tell him that if he's clean then there shouldn't be any problems, and if he wants the money I brought then he needs to take the test. Eventually he agrees to take the test. In the yard. He starts pissing in the cup. He's being a real asshole about it too. ""Come get your piss, boy!"" I take the cup and put the test strip in. I ask if he wants to come clean with me about what he's taking before the results come back. ""Hmm...let's see...heroin, amphetamines, ecstasy..."" He's just listing random drugs. He's still talking shit to me. Saying I'm the worse son ever. I'm humiliating him. All I had to do was just help him. Blah blah blah. 5 minutes pass and the test comes back positive for cocaine. He has a history with cocaine. At first he keeps denying it. He's still belligerently drunk. 

He says he doesn't have money to eat. I ask him to let me see in his house. He refuses for about 10 minutes where he is screaming about this whole situation. Still talking shit to me. Saying I'm the one causing all this. He wants the money though. So eventually he lets me look inside. It's pretty gross in there. He's smoking now so there's a full ashtray on the table. There really isn't much food in the house, but there is a giant pot of chicken boiling on the stove. It's about this time I discover there is a woman here; a total stranger that I've never met. Looks like she is also an addict. I later found out that apparently she and some other man have been living there with my Dad for a while now. The whole time my Dad is screaming at me to get out of his house. I've seen enough. I go outside and sit in my car.

Maybe 10 minutes pass. I'm trying to process all this and figure out what I should do. Eventually he comes back outside to continue screaming at me until I leave. He's got his car keys. He's saying he's going to drive to the store to buy ""some onions."" Everything he says is a lie. I decide that I can't let him drive. He's wasted and he'll either hurt himself or get arrested. I try to get the keys from him, but he resists (enough for me to bend the key) and I back off because I don't want to manhandle the old man enough to hurt him. I talk to him in the yard for a while. More of the same. Eventually he does get in the car and drive off. I follow behind him.

He drives to a gas station really close to his house. He's buying more beer. He actually leaves his car running in the parking lot with the keys in the ignition. I snatch the keys and wait for him. He returns to the car. He's furious. Making a scene. Saying all the same kinds of stuff. I offer to give him a ride back to his house. He refuses. So I leave him and drive off. He sets off walking home. Later I returned to move his car.

I ended up getting in touch with one of his neighbors. Apparently my Dad has been getting worse for a while now. It's questionable whether he actually has a job anymore or not. Since these strange people have moved in with my Dad things have gotten particularly bad.

I'm going to meet with him in a few hours to ""take him to work,"" if that's true, and I'm going to try to convince him that he needs to go to rehab. I doubt that he will agree, in which case I will have no choice but to cut all my ties with him and stop communicating. This will make his life more financially difficult, so maybe I can use that as leverage since he cares more about money than his own family at this point. All his other family have cut ties with him because of behavior like this. I'm not sure how this is going to end up, but I'm praying for the best.

I live far away from my family so I get little bits of information at a time. My sister has been drinking excessively as in straight vodka for years now (5 plus that I know of). She injured herself at work around 2011 and was prescribed painkillers, became addicted, began suboxone. This happened before she started drinking.

She’s been in and out of rehabs both near (an hour away) and far (STATES away) for 2 years now. She always leaves early. More recently she left with a guy and went to New Jersey (rehab was in Florida, the went to New Jersey). She’s from the Midwest where all of our family resides. I am southwest so not much I can do physically.

Examples of her drinking include sending hateful texts to family, being so drunk she’s passed out in her bathroom and at least one incident where she was abusive to one of her kids.

They sent her away to cut off access to kids and long term boyfriend and father of 2 of her kids for 15 years. He says he wants to cut off contact but she came back home last week and is staying with him. She is convinced she is going back to New Jersey but the sister of the man she went there with has made it clear to my mother that they bought her a one way ticket home to get rid of her. They worry about her daily but can’t take the burden.

She’s now staying with father of her 2 kids and we don’t know what’s going on as he is not communicating. He does not drink but has enabled her In the last as he doesn’t do kw what to do.

She was physically abuse by our dad and her ex husband for years and I also found out today she was raped and beaten by a bf when she was 16.

What can I do? Family has given up on her. She will be stuck in our hometown although she either doesn’t know or refuses to believe this is reality. She will likely have nowhere to go as no one wants the burden. She lies and manipulates.

My problem is I am so sad and worried about her knowing about her trauma. She probably can’t cope with it and is drinking to escape.

(29 now) Started with alcohol and weed. Moved to opiates and cocaine. Got clean of pain pills/methadone, cocaine, and weed in 2011. I feel like I got control over the rest of my addictions. Weed I can use now and not be controlled by it. Alcohol too for the last year. I've used itermittently but as a rule I won't use consequtively past 2-3 days and then atleast a month or two break after that. I figure if I don't use everyday it can never rule my life again. 

I started using kratom about 5 years ago and was a daily user until a month ago. It was causing psychosis and bad depression and anxiety so I had to stop. I feel better now but haven't had the motivation I used to with kratom to get things done. I can get a shit ton done fast when I use it. Recently I've been thinking of getting an ounce and testing it to see if I can control it now. I'm a believer that once patterns are broken new better patterns can be instilled. I'm wondering though if picking kratom back up itermittently is a bad idea or not. Right now I'm basically addiction free outside my prescribed gabapentin and nicotine. I know as long as I don't use consequtively I'll be fine and won't have the same problems as before but idk.

I’m a college student and every few weeks when I have a lot due I take high doses of Adderall for about a week. I would say about 40-160mg a day, depending on how focused I feel like I need to be. I eat one meal a day max, sometimes don’t sleep at all for a day or two of that week, and overall feel like I need more Adderall exponentially throughout the week leading up to whatever major assignments or tests I have. I know it’s unhealthy and feel unhealthy during this time but continue to take more. 

After the week long period I don’t take Adderall for around 3 weeks. During this period of time I lack motivation, feel depressed, have social anxiety, sleep a lot, get disorganized, lack motivation to do anything,  etc. I don’t necessarily feel any massive urges to take Adderall during this time. However If I had it I probably would but I don’t because I take every pill leading up to my assignment or test. I only buy Adderall when I have something important
Coming up but when I do buy it I buy a lot and take it fast. 

Ive repeat this cycle of about 1 week on 3 weeks off for the past 2 years sept for over summer and winter breaks from school. 

Before I started taking Adderall I lacked motivation and felt depressed sometimes. After I started this cycle of taking the drug my grades have sky rocketed but the rest of my life took a hard hit.

I’m addicted to sushi. I could eat it for every meal. My record is 27 days in a row. I used to sneak out in high school and take my parents credit card to buy sushi. 

My parents gave me plenty of money for food so access to it wasn’t difficult. They have cut me off a few times but I’m a straight guy when it comes to drugs and alcohol - I don’t really do much of anything so they were happy it was a food addiction versus a drug lol. 

Anyways, now I’m 22 and living on my own and I can’t afford eating sushi every single day. However, sometimes I rationalize the eating habit by eating sushi when I “had a bad day”. Then I rationalize it by saying “it’s the weekend I deserve a treat.”

Basically, what can I do to stop this? No other food tastes remotely as good. I really only ever crave sushi and anything else is just because I can’t afford to eat it for every meal.

I remember birthdays in college. I would see my family and feel a glimpse of joy and love - then they would head home and I would retreat to my apartment. It was in those moments that loneliness was a pleasantry, in comparison to the vast nothingness I felt my life was at that time.

No direction, no hope, and an absolute fear that I was destined to be “apart from”, forever. I had lost my path and I didn’t have a clue as to how I would find my way back - to myself.  I didn’t have a semblance of an idea who “myself” was. 

I was consumed by the destruction of my choices and the collateral damage bestowed upon my loved ones and friends. I guess with my mental state at the time, it was more-so those that loved me rather than loved ones. I had no comprehension of love. I didn’t care to understand because I felt incapable at the very core. All I knew was pain. 

The delusive point-of-view that I was “not meant to exist within this world”. So I buried that pain for years. I compromised any value’s I loosely understood and made a decision to escape every moment that I could, biding time - until, just maybe, I could find my way home. 

Eventually, love brought me home. My mom never gave up. She fought and suffered - but persevered. A sheer testament to a mother’s love for their child. 

Eventually, I found recovery. I watched from the outside for almost 4 years and marveled at the way some of these people changed their lives. My life became easier - but it wasn’t enough. 
I made a decision to wager my life once again. I made a decision to return to the hell that I had once thought long passed. Blissfully unaware, I believed that I could now finally have it both ways. 
I re-opened the metaphorical wound - only to bleed all over those that fought so hard to pull me back. 

In retrospect, the wound never fully healed. I wasn’t ready - until I was. 
Relapse, rehab - wash, rinse, and repeat. This time, however, something changed.
Through all the darkness I finally saw a glimpse of hope. In a way it reminded me of being 7 years old at the lake house, staring up into the sun with my eyes barely cracked. Cracked just enough to let a touch of light into my eyes.  

I made changes, on faith. I shut my mouth (as best I could :p) and I learned from those who have walked the path of recovery, health, and freedom. I chose friends that didn’t need or want my approval. I listened to their thoughts and feelings without comparing and contrasting experiences. I learned to listen to the inner voice. The voice that never died, it was merely drowned out for years and years by all the noise. 

Fast forward 3 fantastic birthdays, pleasant christmases, and even tragedies - that didn’t break me and so much more. Fast forward to this very moment, my 29th birthday. 

Tonight I looked around my backyard, covered in a light drizzle of rain. I saw friends that have become family. People that love me enough to come sit in a back yard covered in dog shit and pouring rain; just to celebrate my birthday. My beautiful, kind son, that chooses to love me and his best little buddy are jumping around and playing with the sticks we have yet to burn. I see joy, love, support, empathy, compassion and SO MUCH MORE in every single one of these people. My wife making sure the kids have eaten so that I can enjoy everyone’s company. She has the most warm and gentle soul - and she chooses to spend her life with me. Blessed is a sinful understatement.

Point being: I never once thought I would be raising a child by choice - and LOVE every second of it. I never thought I would see so much of myself in his words and actions, in a positive light.   I never thought I would be surrounded with friends who want to celebrate with me. I never thought I would meet a partner that I would bicker and squabble with then kiss on the forehead every night before she sleeps.
I never thought I would forgive myself.
I never thought I would be able to sit and just breathe - even for a moment.

It doesn’t matter I’ve been through. It matters how I show up when everything around me is covered in flame and ash. A conscious effort, which leads to a conscious decision to act with love and compassion. 

I’m still in disbelief.

I wrote this for myself. I wrote this for those that loved me even when I made it damn-near impossible to do so. 
I wrote this for someone that may be contemplating suicide.
I wrote this for someone that may have a son, just like me, sitting in their room getting high - believing there’s no way out.

I wrote this for my mom so that she knows I wouldn’t be here without her grit. 
I wrote this for my dad, my sister, my aunts and uncles, my grandmas, and everyone else that contributed the joy that is my life, today. 
WE made it - WE did this. 

Hey Mom. We made it out. 💙

No life is worth losing. If my story makes any bit of a difference, no matter how small, I’ll tell it. 

Trauma and pain became my gateway to truth. I found myself because I just tried. I tried my hardest, and it worked. That tells me that if you try your hardest, it can work for you too. 

Don’t give up. I’ll love you until you realize how wonderful you’ve always been. 

I couldn't have dreamed a better ending for my story - and it's only just beginning.

I've been suffering from really really bad anxiety and depression lately, and have come pretty close to killing myself multiple times in the last months. I think this is partly due to the kratom. 

I think any high alienates you from the world you inhabit. Once you can have all the serotonin that you want at the drop of a hat you disengage and dissociate from the world around you. Things become meaningless. The things that once made you happy become nothing but images and sounds in the background. 

I've always struggled with addiction, and after I got entirely sober for a year and a half getting back on kratom didnt sound like the end of the world, but it was immediately back to getting high for most of the day. Getting the eye wobbles so bad that I vomited. I continued as my tolerance grew and have now been a daily user for a year and a half. 

I want to get sober because I want to be happy. Really, actually happy. I want to be a stable presence for the love of my life, like she's always tried to be for me. I want to make my parents proud, instead of make them worry, because they've always done their best for me and they deserve the same. I want to get sober because I respect myself too much to be an addict. I'm worth more than a stupid, all consuming high. I want to get sober because I deserve happiness.

Is there anyone who already did this change that can tell me how it went and if they recommend to do the changing. 

Hi, I’ve been using heroine for more than 7 years but I started treating my addiction with Methadone (with my doctors guidance) since 4 1/2 years. The beginning of the treatment was difficult but after a year I was not using anymore. However, I had a very bad experience a couple of years ago and since that time I started using again. At the beginning it was once every two months while I continued with the Methadone but during the last year I’ve been using more and more, sometimes two of three times a week. 
One of the reasons ( I think) this has not worked for me is that I am still struggling with depression and anxiety, but another reason is because the place I go to be treated change their doctors often, so I’ve seen at least 5 doctors and each time I am building a personal relationship with them, I get a new doctor and we have to start from scratch once again. 
But apparently the clinic has decided to change their approach and the last doctor I got will be with me until I finish my treatment successfully. I am happy for this change because, contrary to most of the doctors I’ve seen, she specializes in addiction. 
The last time I went to my appointment my new (and hopefully last) doctor told me that one of the reasons I was still consuming was because my Methadone dosage was not the good for me,  apparently I needed a stronger dose and she started increasing my dosage.  She also told me that probably I would react better to Suboxone instead of Methadone but the only thing she said was how the Suboxone works with the receptors and that it doesn’t give you the “relaxing sensation” you get from the Methadone, and to be honest, I’m afraid of changing mostly because I don’t want to miss the “relaxing sensation”. 
I already read about Suboxone pros and cons but I am not sure. Did any of you have made the change from M to S? How did it went? It’s there something I have to be careful/ have in mind?
Thanks for responding and for reading.
Edit: Thank you very much for your answers. I really have a better idea of what to expect and I think I will make the change next time I see my doctor. Cheers!",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.457667}"
2019-10-18 10:37:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/djoegb/pov_from_taking_drugs/,POV from taking drugs,"So recently I have realized that I really like taking drugs, I’m not very sure if I’m addicted, because sometimes I could go on weeks without taking any drugs, I just kind of miss it but not very craving for it during those times. So the point of this post is to ask you guys about your point of view on taking drugs, is there anything like a ‘good addiction ‘?

I am a polydrug user and have only been taking other kind of drugs casually for about 2 years (not including alcohol, even though I drink sometime but I could go on fine without it in a long run). First I started with weed, had a period being a pothead, then after a year, I was into other kinds including molly, acid, dmt, ketamine and cocaine. After weed, acid is my second most used drug. The other kinds I only do occasionally. Personally, weed, acid and cocaine have been my favorite drugs. I like and appreciate the way it transformed me into another person, so I can me more open minded and easier for me to understand other people whom with different mindset (even though some of my experience with coke turned me into a different person in a negative way, but I have learned from experience and improved on that).

So because of this new habit, I have also made a lot of new friends that also take drugs. And they really made me question myself if drugs are really that bad, or most of the people who take it are either irresponsible or misinformed that giving drugs a bad name? Because many of the people I have met, who take a whole lot more drugs than I could imagine until I really do it with them, are very addicted to drugs (I could easily tell) but also having a very stable life (good job, good social life, some have very good families that totally understand and not against them doing drugs) and very open-minded and kind towards other people (drug users or not). And after all, they never see their addictions as a problem.

So I’m in my 20s, and haven’t take any drugs for a month now, and I kinda miss it, even though I still go on with my daily life fine. So what do you guys think, should I take this chance to stop taking drugs (even though I realy don’t feel like I want to do that at the moment), because I have seen some people regret taking drugs in the first place. Or is there really a good way to do it? Or is it not about the drugs, but about us individuals? I would really appreciate your insights.

TLDR; I am a new polydrug users having known a lot people who enjoy their lives to the fullest thanks to drugs, so I’m wonder is it because of the drugs or the individuals that make addiction seem so bad for many people.

I am also prescribed **100mg of sertraline a day,** an SSRI for anxiety and depression purposes, and I only started to even consider sobriety recently because I made an attempt on my life about 5 months ago and figured who cares what I'm taking as long as I want to be alive, but hopefully things are better now.

So! Long story short I'm 22M, **been smoking weed and hash for 8 years** now but it's never really felt like a massive issue to me personally so for me I'm going to exclude that (as well as being a **heavy tobacco smoker**), as much as others most likely won't agree with me there, that's my personal decision to call that '**my sobriety**'.

Currently I'm trying to get clean from **alcohol** and have been purchasing **valium** myself as they wouldn't prescribe it to me (understandably, i suppose) and I also take as much **co-codamol** as i recon my liver can handle (paracetamol is the limiting factor with over the counter codeine, of course).

I've been without alcohol for 2 weeks now and have been taking **2 x 10mg valium a day**, one at around 2-3pm and one at around 6-7pm (the evenings are where i'm worst, anxiety wise, for some reason). Any advice for how to deal with cutting down or entirely giving up valium? My options are either pick up a bulk order (roughly 60 x 10mg), or ask my doctor for some kind of thing to help me cut down, or.. just cold turkey it? I've heard a lot of scary things about cold turkeying from benzos so i wasnt sure but wanted to ask. Of course seeing as **I've consumed 70 x 10mg of valium in 14 days** so i clearly had the occasional binge, which i guess needs to be taken into account. Any advice is greatly appreciated :) Thanks y'all

&#x200B;

I only took it 3 times today( once in the morning , once while I am writing this and once when I came back to flat from office ) , I normally chew 10-15 times a day . I am recluse and dont have many friends, so couldn't ask anyone to remind me of what I have started doing (This). I think posting it here could act as a reminder to me and would prod me to keep at it . If anyone wants to join with me in this healthy endeavour , I would be more than happy to share my progress and track yours.


If you have read so far , I think the least you can do is wish me luck. I am a little skeptical, but if I did succeed , I promise to help someone else to quit these deadly habits. I will keep this thread updated (obviously If mods allowed to post ) .",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46615174}"
2019-10-15 12:18:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/dia70c/my_rant/,My rant,"Hello friends! I wanted to share a comment i made on someone elses comment on r/trashy. It was a pic of a mother, father, and daughter, with a needle and spoon on the sink. Someone commented about being clean, despite drinking occasionally, which was responded with, youre not clean. 

Normally i dont get into it, but i see this comment wayyyy too much, and its upsetting to me. I dont think this type of thinking creates a positive recovery environment for addicts. 

I think i just saw the reply in my notifications as ""its a long winded excuse to not be sober"", which, well, you guys can weigh in here. I dont want to blow this person up. That helps nothing. But here was my reply, nonetheless.



""Thats not necessarily true. Im in the same boat, ive been on the suboxone program for 2 years, looking to get off soon, and still drink moderately with my friends on occasion. 

Treatment programs preach abstinence from all substances, of course, it makes sense. Booze will make a lot of addicts more likely to relapse, or become poly addicts. But not all. Some people were only addicted to one substance, myself included. If im not using opiates, im not doing grimy shit, ruining my life and relationships, and forgetting how to be a functional human being. With alcohol however, i dont have that same feeling of destruction. Im just not an alcoholic. If someone is clean from their drug of choice, and is leading healthy, happy lives, then imo i think its just kind of...rude? To say theyre not clean because they consume other substances. 

So if i have to be abstinent from everything, that means no alcohol, no weed (i dont smoke, just making comparison), no caffeine, no nicotine, no robotussin, no xyz. 

People say that they arent clean because of the potential to be addicts on that substance, because its been seen before in other people. But not everyone who drinks is an alcoholic, not everyone who gets prescribed opioids is an addict, not everyone who is an addict is a poly addict. Abstinence from harmless substances TO THEM is excessive and unnecessary. Now, if someone drinks and relapses, then its not harmless. But someone like me, at 27, who has a few beers on the lake in the summer, etc, who isnt overdoing it, or wanting to cop pills or dope, then i think its as harmless as a non alcoholic drinking. People wouldnt ban everyone from drinking because of the potential of abuse, right? Prohibition happened, it didnt work out very well lol. Albiet for different reasons.

Last note on this book of a comment, if someone uses a relatively harmless substance, ie weed, to get off their DoC, and is becoming a functional human being, then who cares if that constitutes as ""clean"" or not. Its demoralizing to that person whos proud of their sobriety and pulling their life together, to say, it aint shit, you didnt actually pull your life together, you smoke/drink once in a while! Like, its shitting on someone for your perception of sobriety, which clearly isnt theirs. Its hard to say otherwise until youve been in that boat.

Lastly, this isnt a knock on you necessarily, but as an addict, i notice these types of comments all too much, and if this can make even one passerby reconsider how addicts are viewed, then its worth. It seems just ignorance on the subject, ignorance not being a negative connotation. People just dont know because we only teach, drugs are bad, mkay. We dont say what happens to people after falling in love with a substance. 

""The opposite of addiction is not sobriety, its connection...Genuine, human connection""

**The Cancer of Porn Addiction**

When I was 13 years old. I started watching pornography. I grew up in a conservative, Christian household and felt very conflicted when I first started viewing porn. I remember the thoughts in my head, attempting to justify it: “I should see what this is like so I know what people mean when they talk about porn”, and “I’ll watch it to at least understand what the female body is like” (I’m currently 25 and my parents never had ‘the talk’ with me). Fast forward the present and I’ve been addicted ever since that first time I started watching it as a teenager. There were a couple of periods in my life where I gave it up for as long as a couple of years, but for the most part, it’s been non-stop. I watch pornography every day and it has had profoundly negative consequences in my life. For one thing, I don’t find joy in many things in life anymore. Whenever I take long breaks, I get some of that joy back, but then my self-indulgent nature wins out the day and another cascade of dependence begins. Watching porn has completely sucked me dry of any motivation. I realized a while ago that whenever I masturbate, it ruins my entire day. I start to feel lethargic and uninterested and spend my day playing video games and being unproductive. I consider this akin to a miracle that I’m even taking the time to write down these thoughts. Surprisingly, I haven’t noticed any harsh opinions of women or a view of them as solely sex objects as a result of this addiction. However, I’m sure there is some residual effect in that regard. One way it has poisoned in regards to women is that I have not had the drive to go out and date due to a variety of other factors, but also in large part due to the sexual fulfillment I receive from masturbating. Since the pleasure is readily available, and I don’t have to engage in any amount of responsibility, it’s the perfect solution for a downtrodden, irresponsible loser, such as myself. Though I still feel that desire to be in a relationship and even start a family, at the end of the day, I cave in and take the easy road. A lifetime of this behavior has had a deep impact on my behavior and consequently, many aspects of my life including career, relationships, and mental health. I often think to myself “How long do I have to indulge myself before it’s enough?” The true answer is my entire life. There is absolutely nothing to stop me from continuing this behavior even though it has been terrible for my life. I would rather have a terrible life with porn than an uncertain life without it. This post is my first actual step in the right direction in years. I’m finally trying to apply the advice I’ve known for a long time. I don’t know what has made me decide to do this now. But for the first time in a long time, I feel as though I don’t have to look at porn to be ok. I’m taking a gamble on doing things that I want to do and while I’m afraid to fail, I’m going to do it anyway. Because decaying in body and mind due to a self-indulgent poison is no way to live the rest of my life and I have enough other problems as it is. Anyway. I just wanted to share this with the community. I have never shared any of this with anyone before and needed to get my heart out there.",45,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7460202}"

Things like molestation, childhood abuse, neglect and TRAUMA are the real gateways. These things manifest into addiction, hyper sexuality, violent tendencies, self harm etc. All of these things are the SYMPTOMS not the cause of a much larger issue. All of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. This is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications don't typically work. We need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from SELF.

Addiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. This behavior is then difficulty to give up. We need to realize that addiction is not a CHOICE, addiction is not an inherited disease. Addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. 

I think so many can agree, if able to put their egos aside, that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. Maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault, but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. Trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodies/minds (especially when children) cannot comprehend or process. These past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. When we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. I'm sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be, overworking, shopping, unhealthy/over eating, gambling, sex, drama, codependent relationships, etc.. We need to come together and stop judging one another. We need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause, the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. This is a sign of strength not weakness. Trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease, making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease.

TL/DR:  longtime cannabis user who recently started cutting back, I was starting to feel better overall but then today I had a meltdown out of nowhere. People who have quit or significantly cut back on weed/ thc: what was your experience with withdrawal symptoms, specifically in terms of when they appeared and for how long they lasted? I'm particularly interested to hear from people who quit gradually as opposed to cold turkey.

I've been a daily cannabis user for about 3.5 years now. For a lot of that time, I was smoking or vaping 10+ times per day or more. I used cannabis oil almost exclusively for awhile, so my THC intake was even higher during that time. Recently I've just been smoking flower. I refused to admit I was dependent for a long time. A couple of weeks ago, I made the decision to start trying to quit in earnest. For the past 10 days or so, I have significantly cut back. For the past week or so, I've only been smoking once or twice a day, which is a major improvement for me. I can already feel that my tolerance has declined because it hits me much harder, but I still can't get to sleep without it. 

In any case, I thought things were going pretty well until today. I didn't really expect to have a lot of withdrawal symptoms until I actually ceased using it entirely, but today I just completely broke down like I haven't in months. I suffer from serious depression and anxiety, and I had been pleasantly surprised to find my depression and anxiety symptoms actually improving in the past week or so as I've decreased my cannabis usage. This morning, though, I had a meltdown and just started feeling completely hopeless and miserable out of nowhere, crying and feeling the urge to self harm in a way that, as I said, I haven't experienced in a long time. I guess it could be a coincidence, but I can't help but feel that it's probably a reaction to decreased levels of THC in my system - even though I haven't completely withdrawn yet. 

To test this, I smoked a tiny bit about 30 minutes ago, just 1 puff from a joint, and I started feeling way better almost immediately. So, to those who have successfully withdrawn from THC (or just cut back): did you experience anything similar when you started to cut back? Did you find that it came in waves like this? I just want to know what to expect and there is very little reliable information on ""weed addiction"" to be found. Many thanks.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42806682}"

I was home alone in the house and was in search of something (I can’t even remember what) and then I stumbled upon it. Only 5 pills left so I took one, assuming she wouldn’t notice. I left the room. Five minutes later I found myself back in the room taking another pill, because “well if I’m going to do it, I want to make sure I’ll feel something nice.” 30 mins later and I’m coming up on this high. It felt so good that I didn’t want it to end. I went back into her bedroom and stole a 3rd pill. Now there’s only 2 left in the bottle. I even thought about taking the last 2 for future use and putting 5 Advil or some other over the counter pill back in the bottle in it’s place.

(A research chemical amfetamine like stimulant).
So I'm now in queue for rehab and in approximately 1.5 month I will have my intake.

Me and my dad also happen to have a social worker as well that helps us with a lot of practical stuff as well as many other things, all this help we get is because quite a lot of stuff happened in the past, my sister passed away on her 18th in October 2009 and last year January my mother commited suicide 3 months after my dad and mom divorced, since that moment shit's a bit unstable at home to say the least.

I now live with dads and dad has no work for years anymore because of severe depression which has been caused mainly by my sister's passing.

My social worker thought I'd be good to tell my dad about my 3mmc abuse, so I did when we had our weekly appointment and I didn't wanna go into details about it (because I sometimes have mad benders and scary side effects).

Social worker also thought it was a good idea to tell my dad right after that I just came of a bender like a couple of hours prior to our appointment  and that my longest session lasted 70 hours without sleep. 
(I use in my bedroom.)

This all happened 3 days ago and since then my dads just chugging beers all day.

He also came up to my room and showed a list of what shit could happen when I'm on 3mmc and said you could actually get a stroke, which I already knew, but since I'm his only child left he's 10 x more worried obviously.




I regret telling my dad to be honest since he's now extremely worried and drinking a lot of heavy beer and if he'd lose me because I maybe die or something he won't have anybody left, no friends, family, not a dog, nothing.
He's been an alcoholic his whole life but lately he's  cutting down so on some days he doesn't drink at all (which I like because he's the devil when he drinks, and he's on prescription benzo's too).

I used Kratom 4x a day for a month to get off the sub - this was last year in August. It took a long time to start feeling comfortable in my skin.. I still don’t feel 100%, but I heard 1-2 years is how long it normally takes for the nervous system to recover.

I use Kratom about 1-2x a week still. On the days I don’t use that, I’ll either have a tiny bit of weed, sometimes a very small dose of gabapentin, benzo or muscle relaxer. I’ve tried using just kava or l’theanine (or phenibut) and sometimes that’s enough to make me feel better, sometimes not.

I feel hyperactive, nervous or my muscles feel a bit itchy / restless, so I really desire the feeling to away. But I really don’t want to take anything at all anymore.

Do you who have recovered feel the same compulsion due to slight discomfort or take any of the things I mentioned? If so, do you think it’s a bad thing since it’s not a D.o.c and only used in the smallest amounts?

Just to be clear, I don’t ever take opiates (my doc). I don’t allow myself to feed that desire.. so  it seems to me, the other substances are the lesser of the two evils and better to use those for managing lingering discomfort.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5417688}"

Now she's getting old and so am I and I'm really seeing it
I grew up a getting thing that I wanted, I didn't feel like going to school I told my parents (mostly dad) I was sick. I was hungry I called him he came and brought food for me, he seved me anything when I was in need. 

When I was around 17 I simply couldn't have it any more, I was not taught to do the dishes or clean my room, so why the fuck should I do it (my thinking at the time).
  I started moving away from my interest (video games, and video editing) hung out with the wrong group of friends started drinking and smoking weed, so mom basically kicked me out and send me to my granny, I started school did good but not alot of progress.
Kept drinking and second semester I started missing classes and not caring. 

I met this girls, we started dating little after, went from a long distance relationship to living with granny, doing whatever the fuck I wanted at the time, then we moved out, living on wellfare (I think its called) and doing nothing but playing video games wich I got her into soon after we moved out. Well no one can do that for anything but a short time. So I started selling weed to keep us and our habit up.
We lived in a svine stie for about a year and the stress was seriously getting to me.

And so was she, she started messing around, so i got an idea to move away, far away and start a new live. That lasted around a year when she cheated on me with over a dozen guys on social media all while telling me how much she loved me for 2 months before moving away. ( I knew but never accept it) started drinking a case of beers every day when I knew it was over.

I then stayed in our apartment for 2 months meeting another girl, I told her I wasn't going into a relationship anytime soon, that lasted 2-3 months, after that I moved back to my grandma, started working out and got in pretty good shape all while smoking weed on the side, it really helped with my progress, I was sober from drinking until about 2 years in I broke my hand in a pretty dumb way, 100kg benchpress on 1 of January or go out and drink for new years. I chose  to drink, got waisted and hit one of those coin carnival box machines braking my hand, things spiraled down from there.
I was in my bed for all those 3 months I had the cast couldn't do shit. 
Well now 2 years later I'm living with my mom I stopped the weed but got in ritalin witch obviously isent enough, i'v had 6 drinks a night atleast for last 2 weeks. And I dont see that stopping

My memory shit
Ritalin makes me feel nothing so I can keep going. Whatever ppl say to me, (I work in a kitchen, if I get shit I dont care i just keep going.)
I have no feelings for my family and (I have 2 little sisters I used to be proud of but now I barely look them in the eyes while speaking to them)
What used to keep me alive, while having suicidal thoughts where them but now theres nothing, nothing in my head.

Relapse is “part of” recovery in the same way that going back to jail is “part of” becoming a law-abiding citizen. 

If you ask me, the belief that “relapse is part of recovery” encourages relapse. It doesn’t help people stay sober; it helps them relapse. 

Relapse is the OPPOSITE of recovery, just like going back to jail for breaking your conditions is the OPPOSITE of becoming a law-abiding citizen. 

Does it typically happen? Yes. Is it common? Yes. It is *part of* the recovery process? No, it’s part of the ANTI-recovery process. Relapse is *antithetical* to recovery.

I’ve smoked weed just about every day for about 2 years. Before that and for some parts during that I was heavily into drinking. What makes me feel like I’m an addict is even if I would try to force myself to not smoke or whatever I would pretty much always end up doing it anyway. I never really cared and honestly I enjoyed getting high just as much the 1000th time as I did the very first time. Also, I’ve done some other drugs, and I would consider myself a general addict who just happens to enjoy weed. Without weed, I’ll drink any booze laying around, snort random leftover drugs including harder things like molly just because I’m “bored.” I’ve even done shit like pack gbs of straight cigs just to feel some kind of not sober when I’ve had no access to weed. 

I was never able to quit because I always had super easy access to weed. All my friends smoke, I know every plug around and can consistently get it, and even when I don’t have any personally, my dad keeps massive amounts very poorly stashed around the house. This is usually what I would end up dipping into when I tried to quit. 

I’m now at my uncles house and I won’t have access to any drugs or alcohol for about 2 months. What can I expect to come of this? Nobody knows about the extent of my drug use so it’s not like I’m here rehabbing or anything, I’m just here to work and apply to schools to transfer to while I take a semester off. I also had a very strained relationship with my dad, although this was for reasons completely unrelated to any drug use. Anyway, I guess my question is: is there anything I should be doing during this time to change my relationship with drugs? I’ve only been here a few days and while I haven’t had any noticeable withdrawal effects I think about weed alllll the time. I am especially excited as of right now to get home after having my tolerance go away and see what happens when I smoke.

2019-10-11 07:10:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/dgdm25/help_me_plz/,Help me plz,"I am having issues dealing with an addiction, and I could use some advice.  I joined Reddit for the first time today to post this, because if I dont figure this out It will ruin my life.  

Heres the thing, I am not addicted to the normal of addictions you see.  It isnt oxy. It isnt marijuana. It isnt alcohol.  It isnt meth.  It isnt heroine. It isnt anything serious or life threatening.  It's a drug called Gabapentin.  I'm sure some of you have heard of it as it is a drug prescribed often for the issue I have.  

About 10 years ago, I started to notice at night that my legs were itching and feeling as if I needed to stretch. It's actually quite painful. Back then, a quick walk or bath would help immedietely.  But since then, it has gotten worse....heavily worse.  I am diagnosed with Neuropathy and Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS for short).  RLS is a symptom where there is something wrong with your nerves. I was tested and it turns out what is causing my RLS is my nerves are working too hard.  To save time, I'm not noing to explain anymore. Look it up :). 

Anyway, it has progressively gotten worse.  So to help with this, I was prescribed the Gabapentin. At first it was 100 mg 3 times a day.  Then it went up to 300 mg 3 times a day.  Then my doctors made it 5 times a day. Now, I'm at 800 mg 4 times day.  This is 3200 mg, which is still a normal and safe dose, however it's the max that doctors prescribe to anyone.  Problem is, I then started to like how it feels. So since then and for about a year now have been taking WAY more than that. Since this is confidential I will tell you, but I am embarassed and not proud of myself.  Any given night, I will take 40. 

This isnt a drug that you can die from unless you take like 500, so I'm not worried about that. HOWEVER, I am seriously addicted.  When I run out and cant get a prescription,  I get severely depressed from the withdraw.  The RLS when this happens gets much worse than ever before. I become very mean and rude to people including my family and friends. I start to hate people and just stay in and excluded all day and night. 

I have been going to different doctors to make it more accessible to me. Right now 3 doctors prescribe it to me.

I really need advice here.  I cant come out and admit I've been doing this by going to rehab and stuff. I'm just hoping someone who has had a gabapentin abuse problem or has had to deal with its withdraw symptoms has the magic words to get me thru this.  I canceled all my prescriptions and cant even see either of my 3 doctors for months so I cant get any prescribed.  I am committed to this, it's time to stop and get my life back. 

Obviously after, I'll have to find a better and less addictive drug to help with my RLS and Neuropathy.

We have *different* lives. We come from *different* backgrounds. 

Some of us with addictions enjoy going to Twelve Step Meetings, where we **pretend** that addiction is one monolithic problem & we **pretend** that we all completely understand each other’s issues & we **pretend** that we can all follow the same Twelve Steps which are the solution to addiction for everybody. That’s great, *for some people.*

The problem is that Twelve Steppers have a tendency to take their make-believe games a little too seriously. They fail to realize that going to Twelve Step Meetings makes sobriety **harder** for many people. Many people need to **avoid** Twelve Step Meetings and **reject** Twelve Step teachings, otherwise they’ll never be able to get out from under their addiction. 

Twelve Steppers: The advice & practices that are helpful to you are actually **the opposite of helpful** to many other people with addictions.  No, it’s not safe to assume that whatever helped you in your recovery can’t hurt them in their recovery. It’s not safe to assume that you understand exactly what’s going on in their head. You don’t. 

This sub is full of people who love to parrot Twelve Step teachings:

- Go to Meetings
- Work the Steps
- Accept that you’re an addict 

I wish these people would realize that “going to Meetings” causes some people to feel *disempowered* and *pathetic.* For myself: Going to Twelve Step Meetings made me feel like a weak, pathetic victim. 

The beliefs that help me stay sober aren’t promoted in Twelve Step Meetings. Many of the beliefs that help me stay sober are the *opposite* of what they promote in Twelve Step Meetings:

DON’T call yourself an “addict”
Addiction is a choice 
You DID cause it, you CAN control it

I want to do get my stash ready to abuse; prepare the drugs and the vials, and then head to the store in the morning to buy needles. I want to die without her. I've tried to make friends and get out there , I had someone I thought would be my girlfriend but she ended up not respecting my boundaries (not stopping when I said the safe word) and it was just a big replay of my relationship with my wife, just not as intense. So I'm sitting here, the marijuana isn't helping enough, I don't want to get on alcohol because I feel suicidal and that makes it worse, I'm hitting the nicotine as hard as I can to escape the draw of the needle. I have held off for so long; its been years since I stuck a needle in my arm.

.     My wife was the way I quit, she loves me so much and I love her, she cared about me and saw the needle eating away at me; my arms covered in bruises because all of my track marks are fucked with my shaky hands. I want to feel that feeling of everything being alright, of happiness, that warmth, the calming sensation, and the rush. I want to die, but instead Im rationalizing and trying to compromise with my mind, saying instead of killing myself I'll go get some needles and relax. I feel so empty and alone without her; I got a restraining order on her and she is homeless now, with out cat, living in a car; I feel like a monster, I can't take it, I can't take it, I can't take it.

Those things are slimy because all you've got to do is pick it up from your pocket, press the button, and you're high.

Porn is actually addicting in the same way cocaine is, they do the same thing to the brain just that cocaine does it more. I've been wanting to quit both for like 3 years now (I'm 22) but it's haaard. Weed I can do since it's more of a habit, but porn is a different story. Porn has this way of tricking your brain into thinking it's the best option for you right now. It's like cigarettes (which I've been addicted to but been able to shake really easily). Only thing is it never reaally. Porn takes away a certain energy *I think* but I have a hard time actually relating good things that happen to me to me abstaining from porn. Don't get me wrong, I do feel like I'm low energy after jerking it *but* I can feel low energy other times as well. It's not like weed where you clearly notice your memory and social skills disappearing the day after having smoked. With porn it's harder to make that connection so it seems to me that it's more of an intellectual challenge in that you have to actually figure out your triggers and consciously and with discipline implement changes. Only problem with that for me at least is that it only works for 2 weeks, after that I forget all about it. I don't have a girlfriend either and never have had one which makes it even harder.

Whatever, I just wanted to share this with some. Is there anyone out there who have this same problem with trying to quit for years but not succeeding? Did you get out of it? What changed?

My mother told her to move out for the kids sake, so she did. My brother has been using meth for about a year now. We have a neighbor who is the neighborhood drug dealer. My brother lost his job and recently had another kid within the year. My brother has been like schizophrenic like / psychotic. Which I've read that meth can do to you. I don't know if he now has a mental disorder. We were raised with a loving mom but had issues with drugs before and an alcoholic dad, pretty much a very broken family. There is drugs in both sides of family and suicide. He is not my brother anymore and is becoming increasingly violent. We called the cops three times already. Today we had to because he wouldn't let my mother take his boy back over to his mother's. He wigged out and blamed us for everything in his life. We called once today and they didn't really do much because we weren't there (long story). We called again and they came again,  talked to him inside our messy house and they took him to a detox in the city for one night! This was the only place that would take state care when I read about it. But as far as I know he has to commit himself into getting help?. And he's a hermit and a very bad case of meth addict with severe depression. He has used Downers and alcohol his whole life. My dad gave him alcohol when he was 12. My brother has had extreme anxiety and social problems, he doesn't drive and he would be too nervous to go to a job interview. What do I do? Do my parents put him on to their insurance and force him to go to a place for mental help? I've called almost every place months ago and they said when dealing with meth addicts there's no real detox treatment but cognitive therapy. But how can I get him to get help? Is it ultimately his decision to go. The police had only one option which was to file a protection order, which I think means he can't come back to the house. My mother doesn't want him to be on the streets but I think that's the only thing, because if he comes back he'll use and be more tormenting.  Please help I'm stuck in the middle, my dad is not there he's a ""blame game"" type of guy. He hates my mother because of his own depression. I love my brother and he's said some very demented things to all of us but I know this is not him!!! Is there any options?",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80116767}"

namely coke and drink. He’s been clean all month so far, and honest, keeping me by his side for support. 

he bravely went to his very first therapy appointment, and did extremely well For his first day, being honest, with no resentment or even defeated feelings. coming in only with an attitude of hope and determination for a better tomorrow. He was honest and i was suprised to see him be so open even if he was very nervous at first.

i just dont know where to put it, but I’m so incredibly proud of him today I can’t even put it into words.   


this all spawned from essentially what was an spur of the moment intervention by me and my father, where he realized how his addiction and neglect of his mental health was hurting himself and people around him. being thats a very hard realization to accept and make, I think he’s moved forward with it in strides already. And I’m very proud of him for letting us in, and hearing us out without becoming angry, or staying in denial.   


i just have no wordsmith I love him deeply and I’m so happy for him and so proud.   
Im exited for him to start seeing and feeling the better things in life as things turn around, and I also know it won’t be easy and there will be strenuous times for us. But I’m ready here with open arms and support always.

it feels good that he finally sees his life is worth fighting for, I’m so proud, I’m so happy.   
I wish this for anyone and everyone who needs a helping hand in recovery or is helping someone recover.

He had a problem with smoking week years ago and went to rehab for it in 2012. He thought that since he is married now and in a different place in life that he could handle it more responsibly. It turns out he can’t. It quickly got out of control and what was supposed to be a just on vacations or some random Saturdays kind of thing, turned into an every single day after work thing...

Then when I asked him if he could just do it on weekends, he said he thought my concern was valid and he went to just weekends. Although he started feeling some withdrawal effects and realized he’d still need it to fall asleep at night. So he started taking a puff or two right before bed.

But recently, he ran out. He went through $750 worth of vape cartridges between July and September. He said that he realizes at this point is tolerance is really high and he needs to stop because he’s been down this road before. He knows where it leads and he doesn’t want to go there. I was so proud of him for making that decision! But now...

We are about a week into withdrawal and I’m losing it. He’s being so mean. His irritability sucks. I feel like he doesn’t want to be around me, is annoyed by me, we’ve been fighting, he’s been harsh and unforgiving...I have reached deep down for as much grace as I can for what he’s dealing with but I’m tired. And I miss him. There’s a cavern of space between us because of his irritability and depression and desire to isolate. 

He has the numbers for two male counselors. I got recommendations for him from my counselor, because he said he wanted to go and knows it would help during this quitting process. But he hasn’t contacted them and I’m getting really angry about it. It’s not hard to just write a damn email and set up an appointment. But it’s like he’s just too overwhelmed by withdrawal symptoms, insomnia, and trying to still work full time and hide those symptoms as his job, that making an Appt is just too much to deal with so he isn’t doing it.

ALL OF THIS is affecting me. It’s not about me, I realize that. And I want to be supportive and helpful. But mostly I just feel hurt, helpless and angry. How do I get through this? How do WE get through this and maintain a marital closeness?

We’ve been through so much this year. I had (and beat) cancer, but lost my fertility in the process. I have to think he used weed to numb out the pain.

&#x200B;

Back in January I met an addict of course I didn't know she was an addict at the time because I'd never known one. Unfortunately she was hard into the drugs to the point of prostituting herself for the drug (I honest to god don't even know what she was taking she was into injecting it, but she said for a less addictive way to use it you could snort it or suck on it in a spoon?). She told me her story a beautiful woman just turning 30, she got addicted in high school when her boyfriend introduced her to the drug and basically used her when she was addicted to it.  

&#x200B;

 All her life she had men take care of her and had really had no real skills for real world survival. She was living with her boyfriend down here in florida when they split november of last year she says he was cheating on her so she turned to the drug, but honestly I don't know the truth of it. She went to live with her elderly father when he died of a heart attack and she was basically left alone with no income or way to support herself since her family is originally from pennsylvania and she has no one down here. She did have a friend though i'll just call him J, I met the guy myself an ex-military man and by god he was a great guy I came over to hang with them a lot, he let her stay at his place and this wasn't a you stay here for sex type of a thing, this was a i'm your friend and i'm trying to help you type of deal. Honestly i've never taken any drugs or done much of anything risky so this was kind of out there for me. I watched her sitting in the bathroom all day taking impulsively taking showers and texting dudes on a burner app to meet up for money. This was the first time I've seen addiction, everything with her literally revolved around making money by having sex and then shooting herself up with the drugs. It was more important than sleep she would go 24+ hours without sleep, more important than eating, she was damn near a skeleton and when she did eat she would take 3-4 bites and throw it away. She was so hard to understand when talking I thought it was a pennsylvania accent but it was just how she talked on these drugs. Well she borrowed money from drug dealers to buy more drugs and surprise surprise she did not pay it back and they found her at the friends house kicked down the door and punched her in the face, he basically kicked her out after that as this whole thing happened when he had his kids for the weekend.  

&#x200B;

At this point she had no where to go and like I said I was her friend, pretty fresh out of college still living at home with my family saving money to move out so I couldn't invite her over. I did not want to leave her alone so I payed off her debt with these drugs dealers which was around 500-1000 dollars. I did my best to buy her hotel rooms when I could and I would come back to make sure she was ok and stay with her. (this includes having to go sit in the car when she had a customer coming and she would do this at any hour of the day or night)  She was so paranoid that the cops had the room taped or that cops were hiding in trees or bushes. She would also literally sleep for 24 hours if I'd let her. She knew she needed money to keep the room the next day but she would spend it all on drugs. One day she got a call her 12 year old daughter began cutting herself. this shook her she was really gung-ho about getting her act together and going back to pennsylvania to see her kid. looking back I think this was just an act I don't think she had any intention of putting in any real work to go back home. She would ask me to do everything for her, from try to fill out this rehab form for me, to try and register me for food stamps.

&#x200B;

Eventually I ran out of money this way I think I had 7k in the bank before i met her in january. because it is damn more expensive to stay in a hotel every day than to own a house or rent an apartment. At some point I asked my family for money and they found out what I was doing which caused a big reaction my mom went sleuthing and don't her childrens fathers what she was doing and they were basically threatening to take her custody away. At that point we couldn't see eachother anymore she was upset at first, but eventually came around to forgiving me on her own. Her mother got her a plane ticket and basically made her come back to her home state to go to rehab. Everyday/night until then she was meeting people for money and shooting up she had even given me her burner phone log in info to help set meets up for so I could see the conversations she was having with these guys who were paying her for sex with money or drugs. There was a dude who was asking her to tattoo his name on her body and she agreed i'm sure the only thing that stopped that from happening is he flaked or she took to long to answer him back between talking to more than one dude, being paranoid, or shooting up. Another dude claimed he had STDs and wanted to fuck raw, she was down with that again only thing stopping that was him flaking or her being too hard to get a hold of.

&#x200B;

I was happy when I heard she was  going to rehab, was somewhat short lived when I heard she got kicked out of rehab after about a week because she tested positive for a substance, she blamed them for not putting her in detox, which I agreed with her, she had been arrested as soon as she got back to pennsylvania so was in jail and therefore had no drug in her system when she went to rehab. Her mom was pissed and would not let her come back home so she was on her own and had to stay at a friends place and god most of her friends were addicted to something. She said she wanted to get back into rehab and did not have any money and she did not want to resort to prostituting again for it. I spent about 170 dollars to uber her from her heroin addicted friends house to a hotel closer to her hometown where the rehab was and I sent her 500 to get supplises for rehab. She went in got detox and was staying there successfully.  

&#x200B;

I was so happy that she wasn't out being used by those guys and shooting up drugs and she like a different person I was surprised i could understand what she was saying half the time now that she didn't have that weird drug induced speech impediment. At some point she said she missed me, i said I missed her to and it was cool having her as a room mate. Then she said she wanted something more with me, a relationship. I was happy I had loved her so much and I didn't care that she had been a prostitute at some point. She stayed in rehab a full month then her mom and stepdad allowed her to move in with them as she continued outpatient rehab therapy. Things were going so good.  

&#x200B;

I always told her I'd see her as soon she got out. I made plans to take off from work and fly up to see her and communicated with her the whole way. 5 days before my flight she posts a picture with some dude on facebook she tells me has wealthy parents and shes just using him and not to worry about it. She's never lied to me so I took her at her word, honestly I love the woman too much to have her say she's doing this to another guy and going along with it.  

&#x200B;

I go there in June and let me tell you I have never gone more than one state away from my home state let alone had the interest to ride a plane for the first time anywhere, but I did it for her. I was sour about the other guy, but she reassured me she wanted to be with me and wanted to come back down to florida when she gets custody of her kid. I had an awesome week up there though getting meet her mom and dad and be with her as boyfriend/girlfriend. She was however still prostituting, her mom knew as well but we said as long as she isn't doing it for drugs, we'll let it slide. The couple that has custody of her child states that the therapist says she was hurting herself because she was having issues feeling like she was betraying her mother by loving the couple that has custody of her. They were 100% down for reestablishing contact with her and her daugther but they wanted to start with slow steps. The first step was for her to write a letter to her a daughter and her daughter would sit down and read the letter with a therapist to help process her feelings.

&#x200B;

Like the next 2 weeks back in florida its july now, she is still in pennsylvania. She has a blow up with her parents i believe about trying to come and go and late hours and she left the house, begging me to give her money for a room for a few days which I did hoping she would get over whatever happened to move back in with her family. She relapses and I find out she back in detox. I'm not happy she relapsed but I was happy she was so quick to get help with it. Suddenly she left rehab after a week of detox She tried to go back to her family's place but they told her she had to do another month long stay at rehab before she could come back. She refused. She refused staying at her families place rent free and working toward seeing her daughter so she could couch surf and lose money spending it on hotel rooms. From this point on with every check i'm taking out amscott payday loans to keep the woman I love off the street, i'm bascially going on 80 dollars between paychecks having to spend it on gas money for work.

&#x200B;

The other dude she told me not to worry about apparently said he would pick her up from rehab and no showed so she blew up on facebook about how shitty a boyfriend he was and how shes ""waiting for her next mistake to enter her life"". I'm like "" really so that fake relationship was real?"" I told her how that situation made me feel, being the secret boyfriend nobody can know about she apologized for doing that to me and told me it wouldn't happen again.  

&#x200B;

So here she is staying at a friends place every few days until her friends don't want to let her stay over. She begs me to get her a car, I think it over do I love this woman enough to agree to pay back a loan for the next 5 years of my live? she pleads saying she always feels so trapped that she can't go anywhere. I cave in and take out a loan for 7000 dollars so she could purchase a 2200 dollar car/ stay in a hotel room here and there while shes looking sellers, don't ask me how the math on that works. she promises she'll use some of the money to buy stripping clothes and use the car to get there, she will work and pay to stay with a room mate. Of course she relapses. Which I find out in early september.

Its now late september. She says she's going to rehab and needs 500 dollars to get supplies sounds fair enough to me, I did it the first time and she went to rehab like she said she would. I did it this time and theres always a reason. At some point she was telling me she needs her ID to get into the detox program at the rehab so she just needs to drive down and get it. This was literally the last monday in september she said this. Since then this woman who is staying at her girlfriend's place on her couch with no job and no where to be 24 hours a day 7 days a week can't manage to drive herself down to the DMV in the car I bought for her to get her ID and go to rehab. I forgot to say since I've found she is using again it is difficult to get a hold of her it will take her almost a whole day to get back to me in a text and she barely picks up the phone. No job or any obligation to be anywhere 24/7 and you can't reply or call back within a reasonable time to the man you call your boyfriend?

Today I found her prostitute number, again I know shes been prostituting and been pretty accepting of it providing its all physical and for money ( I image guys dating porn stars have the same understanding with their girls?) I sent her a message asking about her boyfriend pretending to be a john who has a kink for doing someone elses girl. just to see what she says. States she has a 100 of them. I ask for a picture of her boyfriend sends me a pic of her and some guy who definitely isn't me. I ask her if thats her main guy she says she has no main boyfriend. She will answer to her phone app to go prostitute herself faster than she will answer a call or text from my regular number. I'm so disappointed in her right now. The woman who says she wants custody of her daughter so bad. She is in the same state as her daughter closer physically to her than she has been in years and she isn't even making the effort to go back to rehab so she can get back on track to trying to see her. In the beginning the love was real, on these drugs I don't know what lie and truth is anymore I don't know that she loves me anymore I can't tell from her words. Now I'm basically waiting to call her and confront her on this.  She said she was going to write her daughter that letter 4 months ago now in early july. 4 months thats almost half a year. She told her daughter living in the same state her that she was going to contact her almost half a year ago and still has yet to do it.

I am always so quick to help others, care for other and always want to ""fix"" others. I now see that at times this is a way for me to hide from wounds I'm unwilling to take care of within myself. Caring for someone else temporary distracts myself from how I'm feeling inside. It gives me temporary pleasure just like any other addiction. 

Do you find yourself constantly in relationships where you're trying to fix someone else? I know I have and I now know this is a way to distract myself from the fact that I need to fix my own self. If this resonates with you then start to do the work to look within. We all have wounds. We will never heal these wounds with anything outside of ourselves. After I help someone else I am eventually left feeling empty inside because I'm not doing the work to help myself. We cannot help or care for anyone else if we are not helping and caring for ourselves first.

Gray ash flicked from the tiny emblazoned weed nug wrapped in Backwoods tobacco leaf, Raw paper. Not a dutch, those are cardboard. Sizzles a bit when put out on concrete, in the rain. Smoke rising and twirling and hanging in the air like the gaseous embodiment of my spirit. My jay’s were haphazard, and blunts never really pearled. The slight burn of the throat when dried toe was rolled into the joint, the following pull of gravity on the body, that comes with smoking a lot of tobacco.  If I could tell you how exhaling pool of smoke, admiring wet leaves, misty rain, blazing sun, or light breeze on cool night, how smoking alone in the nature of New Jersey tugged at my heart strings. Like a space cowboy looking out, contemplating loneliness and beauty. 

I dumped my weed onto the grass behind the church. I went back to look for the scattered nugs that time. Once I dropped the remaining weed I had down a drain pipe that miraculously had just the right circumference for my special little circular container of weed, so that it dragged itself down into the darkness. That was unintentional. I tried to fish it back out with a pitiful plan of using super glue and a stick. All I did was successfully push it down further. It was on the verge of rain that day too. I even went back with a new and equally pitiful plan of using string instead of a stick. Antics of a substance abuser, an addict. Today I threw my weed away in the trash because that’s how I am. Operating on whims and fantastical plans and epiphanies whose grand pull wisps away with time, like the smoke of every joint, blunt, bong or pipe I’ve ever smoked out of. 

Fuck it man, let those lungs breathe air. Bronchioles, Alveoli, let O2, blessedly, pass along them. Say good bye, for now. Those friends who ask to smoke along dark sidewalks, rooftops. Those moments of music and solace. It’s beautiful. I ain’t mad at it. I’m saying good bye. Hunting weed dropped on the ground cuz it’s the last of it. Pulling in smoke that you shackled to. Can’t be shackled to nothing that wisps away so. Will becomes like wind. Mindless chase of the weed man who don’t answer your call. Time to say good bye.

I mean no harm, no negativity. ain't talkin no shit. honestly, they're good people. odd, not the most well-rounded, neurotic - yes yes and oh yes. but not bad people and certainly not intentionally, well...shitty. ok, here goes -

i'm currently 27, the youngest of 4. the next youngest sibling I have is almost 9 years older. I was always smart (as a kid, anyway - not exactly stupid but certainly no genius these days after what I've put myself through over the years), and learned early how to be in some ways manipulative. not in a malicious way - more in a ""behave this way, say these words, try to look this way, etc. to get everyone off your back before they even think that get on it so that you can do whatever the fuck you want in peace"" sort of way. I took tons of mental notes on what not to do, in seeing my older siblings get ""caught"" or reprimanded for certain behaviors.

what I'm saying is, I was good at what I did - and what I ended up doing on a constant basis from a young age was lying and faking my ass off to appear to be a well mannered smart little goodie goodie so that I didn't have to deal with the groundings and punishments my siblings did when they fucked up. most importantly I wanted everyone the hell out of my business - even if punishments weren't an issue.

so at first, yeah, I was good at hiding my drug use. very good. I was also an unusually bored and inquisitive kid. very ""what's this button do"". in a very ""drugs are bad, study more! learn everything!"" type of household, i'd huffed inhalants by 4. sneaked excessive doses of my own cough syrup by 6. stolen others prescribed painkillers and adderall etc by 10. by 12 I looked 16 and was able to get damn near whatever I wanted from older kids. by 14 I'd mostly settled into my favorites, and had a regular usage ""schedule"" of maybe .5g or more of meth and maybe 40 percocet 10's a month with other substances sprinkled in. by 15 I still wasnt, imo, truly ""hooked"" - while opiates were my favorite, i was actually kinda getting bored.

but boredom has always made me more reckless, so soon after turning 15 I found myself in a position where heroin was available and someone experienced with IV was willing to do it for me. I fell in love and for the next ~8-9 years it became my life and obtaining more became my sole purpose. 

I bullshitted my way through the rest of high school as a point of pride - i'm not failing or dropping out so I'm not an addict, I'm ok. I attempted to snort low quality h I was nervous to shoot but couldn't not ingest, and - long story short - ended up with a massive infection that caused paralysis of over half my face for about 6 months, some permanent vision loss in the eye and permanent near complete deafness in the ear on that side. I had multiple collapsed veins in my feet. a few abscesses on my feet and arms. falling all over the place - fell down a flight of stairs in school resulting in broken bones and dislocated knees and I barely felt it at the time. I tried to be discrete and essentially ""sneak out"" - but as ~3g of h and ~.25g of meth a day is an expensive habit - I was away from home a *lot*, working in drug production/transport/sales to support it. at some point I was grey skinned sunken eyed and ~90 lbs at 5'3. 

my excuses were I was ""tired"". hanging out with friends who work late shifts, sorry bout coming in at 5am, dad. I just still feel chubby at this weight mom, that's why I keep losing - nothing to worry about though you know me, I'll stop dieting before it's  a problem. I know I've been out of school 2 years now but I just don't know what I wanna go to  college for, just gonna keep writing that book you've never seen or heard details about cause I'm shy about that kind of shit you know. they were horrible half assed fractured lies by this point but somehow they still worked...?

I know it's been a hell of a long post, but I felt details not severity and longevity necessary to explain why I can't understand this, my real question here:

never, not once, did my well meaning, hard working, generally supportive and pleasant parents discuss addiction with me. they honestly appeared to not have known. light comments - no pushing - on my weight and general shitty unhealthy appearance and the possibility that I might have an eating disorder were made - but very easily dismissed. not one word to make me suspect that they suspected what my real problem was. my dad was an addict himself in the past, to meth and alcohol. my mom had a previous marriage to a heavy drug addict. these are not naive people. I'm 27, have been clean  (for the most part) for a few years, live with my boyfriend and am generally doing financially ok - and my parents still surprise us with groceries and little gifts. my dad is quite handy and has recently helped us with plumbing and air conditioning issues. these are kind, loving people. 

so I'm asking family members of heavy users and addicts, especially parents - how the hell? is it truly possible to be in denial so deeply as to miss this? is it a ""not my kid, they're too smart"" thing? is it a ""well people pushing and nagging didn't help me, gotta let her figure it out on her own"" thing? I know no one can read their minds, but as someone who can at this point spot an addict in 2 minutes 10 feet away, I can't understand how this worked out the way it did for me. I used to  be bitter, almost partially blaming them - ""how could you guys not see it, not try to help me?"". I've since realized that this was and is my business, my ""fault"", my responsibility and no one else's - but still I cannot understand. if anyone who's been through this can just shed some light on wtf goes through the minds of loved ones of an addict, that'd be awesome - I just wanna understand their possible points of view.",1,{'infect': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42202154}"

Still watch it daily and it makes a distraction. I think about sex all day, every day. I have even thought about what sex with a man would be like since my early twenties, never have I acted on it though. I feel as if when my anxiety acts up, porn and masturbation ease. 

And my curiosity on having sex with a man has not eased up. Before I got married I even spoke to several men on dating sites but never met up in person. Im not sure if its the idea or curiosity that is driving this, but not every man raises my curiosity. And its only a certain type of guy too. For some reason its older men that are around the 50s that usually get the spark back.

I have always had an extremely obsessive/addictive personality very weak minded, giving into impulses cause it feels too good. I first used the needle about 5 years ago. Eventually i caught a   possession charge. 3 years probation. I was able to isolate and substitute my addiction for video games for the time being. 1.5 years till they cut my paper short for zero dirty urines. I relapsed last year and went out hard. Heroin and meth through the needle and my script of benzos with some alc when i had nothing else. Half the rush i get is hitting the vein, pulling the plunger back and seeing that little red mushroom cloud explode and give you the clear go ahead. You're in. All of your problems dissipate for a short time. Nothing else matters. I got a dui a month ago. I checked myself into rehab to look good for the court. Also i had burned all my bridges and felt i was at the end of my road. Get out and i start obsessing again almost immediately. I bought a bottle and now its all i can think of.

Please don’t tell me I knew better than to get into a relationship with him. I loved him, and this is where we are at now. He went from avoiding his family, to now seeing them almost every weekend. Which is awesome. He looks better, he’s gained weight. All signs that he’s headed in the right direction. He isn’t working yet, but after he leaves his treatment program each morning, he sends me a picture of him and our dog taking their morning walk, as a way to sort of say he is safe and not out on the streets getting high. I didn’t ask him to do this, he seems to like doing it. 

There are a few times where I thought I’ve felt something such as a needle or a cooker or a needle cap in his jean pockets, and he got really offended, and refused to show me what it actually was until hours later (last time, I was wrong - it wasn’t a cooker, but a soda bottle cap that was not used for drugs). His father sent him $40 which I gave to him yesterday. We spent half the money last night at Royal Farms on cigarettes and snacks. 

All day today I was worried because we established a money boundary a pretty long time ago, since cash is a trigger for him. Today I nicely brought it up (probably 4 or 5 times, I know, too much), that I really wanted to know if he still had the money. He said it was in his pocket but I really wanted to see it just for reassurance. He is dead set and firm on not showing me and saying that he shows me enough proof. I feel that his addiction led us down a very dark road where a lot of boundaries were destroyed, and it wouldn’t hurt to show me that he had not spent the remaining $20 on drugs. The fact that he didn’t show it to me, of course leads me to believe that he did. I’m trying my hardest to get out of detective mode. 

He says if he were to show me proof whenever I wanted that I would take advantage of it and it wouldn’t help build trust. I have explained that his addiction had huge consequences for our family and that I believe he will have to bend on doing things that might be slightly uncomfortable because there were many times that his using caused discomfort and trauma for others as well as himself. What do you guys think as far as proving your sobriety to family and loved ones? As in, the people who are most supportive to you (emotionally, financially, provide housing, safety, and have been there for you and not given up on you when the world told them to let you go)? 

Am I being unreasonable? If I am, I intend to do my best to totally work on changing my way of thinking in order to support his recovery and my own emotional recovery as well. But I can’t help feeling like this is another manipulation. Please don’t respond by saying we should break up. That’s not an option at this point. We have come too far and love eachother too much. I live in a city where the fentanyl crisis is very severe and killing people everyday. He also has a seizure disorder that was caused by drug use. We are both in our early 30s. I realize that relapse is often seen in behaviors leading up to the actual use, and he seems more stable but he still has his days since we all know that addiction coincides often with things like depression and physical discomfort. Thank you for any input. 

TL;DR My fiancé has been clean from heroin/fentanyl and cocaine for a little over a month and when I wanted him to show me that he still had the $20 cash that was given to him, to prove it was not spent on drugs, he refused. But he does other little things to show he is clean. I’m wondering what lengths other people go to, if at all, to be honest and help reassure their loved ones that things are going to be OK — or if I’m being too much and need to chill out.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46592984}"

I've been chronically smoking weed for about 2 years and during that two years it has gone from recreational, to medicinal, to a substance I completely rely on.

I used to go home on my lunch break to get through the day. I would smoke as much as I could and go back. Working with people and being so anxious all day made me do it. 

I'm not able to eat without access to put prior. It's just not the same, and I'm not able to enjoy my meal. However when I am high I cannot control my eating habits. 

I struggle with mental illness and I have been medicated. During this time I have not been able to quit smoking weed although my doctor has recommended it. Weed is the only thing I cannot forget. Medication could never be regulated and I'm not currently taking any now. I have not consulted a doctor about it. 

I have been sleeping more than 12 hours daily and it's still not enough. I cannot concentrate in school or work and I never feel like I am able to focus. 

I am constantly in a fog. I never know what's going on, and I'm tired of it. I want control of my life. I want to choose my direction.

My boyfriend smokes as well and getting it out of the house is impossible though he would be supportive of me quitting.
