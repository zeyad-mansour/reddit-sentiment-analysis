The Relapse

9:07 PM

Here I sit. After two weeks of sobriety, waiting on my hookup to swing by with some Go. Why? To escape? To fly? To run? To feel good just one more time? Is this really a relapse? Some people would say so. Some would say it's just one night of fun or feeling good. I say neither. I didn't relapse, and I didn't have fun. I use these methods to escape what's going on in my head. If I ever really told someone what I see and feel, I'd be committed for life. And if it had been decades ago, I'd have been burned at the stake. And in some dimensions, worshiped. Wouldn't that be nice?

The High

4:18 AM

I love it.  I don't wanna give it up. And I've come to accept the fact that I'm never going to NOT do drugs, recreationally of course. Have to stay in control.  And if I happen to OD in the midst, so be it. Even as I come down.. I don't regret what I did. Maybe some people aren't meant to stay clean. 

I don't know what I like more, the drug, or the seeing the blood come up through my rig. Euphoria.

The Comedown

9:09 AM

I lay here still chatting, still feeling the after effects. I love who I am during this time. This may sound awful, but it doesn't bother me. I don't even crave more. And that's the best part. No withdrawals and no cravings after the fact. So why not keep doing it every once in a while? What's the difference in enjoying what I do after a long work week and someone else enjoying a beer or a joint? Not a damn thing! Fuck it",2
2020-05-30 22:46:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gtr84q/addicted_brother/,Addicted Brother,"I have an older brother. He helped me get clean about 6 years ago. He had 4 years clean when I had 1 year. He helped me work the steps and everything. When my 1 year hit he relapsed a few times then got clean again. He moved a couple provinces away about 3 years ago to see if the change would help him. 

He told me he was clean and things seemed good. In the last few weeks his behaviour changed and it was like he had psychosis. About a week ago his girlfriend told me he's been using then it comes out he's been using for about 2 years and is now using harder and more then ever. 

I was so hurt when I found out about the lying to me. Not the using the lying. I wrote him a letter about how hurt I was and how I can't have him around my girlfriend and that I can't have him at my graduation or my wedding. He went completely ballistic on me then blocked me on everything. I will always love him always no matter what he does I just can't take the hurt anymore and even when or if he does get clean again I can't let him in as close as before after this hurt I don't want to risk getting hurt that badly again.

Ive had my moments missing him and hurting but for the most part have gotten myself together and pushing on. Tonight though I'm completely heartbroken and miss him so badly. I know all he cares about is the drugs right now I know that because I've been there. I just keep having this nawing pain and question of ""Why am I not enough for you to stop?"" I thought him and I had something special and why doesn't he hold it as close as I do. Part of me keep thinking if he could just see me if I could just give him a hug he would turn around he would go get well again. This pain is giving me using urges I'm angry and jealous that it feels like he gets to numb out he gets the escape and here I am alone without my superhero anymore. I just want a small break and I know of I take that break I'll end up right where he is now. 

I'm sorry if this was the wrong place to post I just couldn't really find anywhere else on Reddit that this would maybe fit. I'm lost scared and hurt. Anyone have any advice or words of wisdom? I'll take anything I can right now.",1
2020-05-30 21:55:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gtqit2/nail_biting_addiction/,Nail biting addiction,"I don't usually post to subs like this, or even post in general, but I've been struggling for awhile. I know my addiction isn't as bad as some other addictions out there, but I just hate it so much.

I've been addicted to biting my nails my whole life (I'm 17) . I've tried using anti-nail bite nail polish, and I just ended up ignoring it and dealing with the bad taste. I got braces a few years back and that stopped it a bit, since I couldn't fit my fingers between the two wires and hit the nail with my teeth. I realized I could use nail clippers to do a similar thing as biting, and I would idly do it without realizing.

I'm so sick and tired of my fingers constantly hurting, and a few years back it got to the point where I would bite the skin instead of the nail itself. The only way to stop is to put band-aids over all my fingers so I cant access them.

I feel like this is a self-harm type thing but i am not really sure. I can usually quit but start again once I get stressed out or more depressed than I usually am. I am extremely ashamed of my fingers and have broken down multiple times when people notice them and comment on them. I don't really know what I am achieving with this post, but I just want to vent.

I feel the cravings the most after a day of hard work when i want to relax, most of the time i can reward myself with the high i get from a good habit like running or gym but during this pandemic my pot-smoking habit has gone through the roof.

I've tried replacing it with other dopamine releasing habits but the feeling of rolling, sparking  it up and just puffing away literally waters my mouth and i can't seem to shake the thought of undergoing the action. 

Smoking tobacco is the last thing i gave up (1year ago) and pot is the first thing i started (10 years ago) so the thought of never actually smoking again really gets to me.

I think the handling of smoking is a habit on it's own for me, whatever i'm smoking. 
So i'm thinking to go buy a vape maybe? Feels like i'm cheating since i've always been able to  go cold turkey on everything else.",1

I was out of work for months and relapsed on meth after years. I got rid of all my connects and would have a lot of trouble finding it, and im running out. I know the best thing to do is throw the remainder out and all that but I cant bring myself to do it.

 The big problem is that I unexpectedly got a job opportunity after relapsing which makes my quitting plan a lot harder I feel. My new job is requires a ton of manual labor and a completely different schedule than I'm used to. I got through the first two days, but it taxed my body extremely hard and I almost passed out both days, threw up too. Its the best opportunity I've ever had and im really scared im going to be useless at it during withdrawal. Mornings are so groggy and it takes hours to feel completely functional.

   This would have been fine with my old night job, id have ran out and maybe taken a few days off and slept in for a week, just chugging coffee at work to get through it. But this job is so taxing on my body. Im putting myself in a lot of danger by doing it on meth but im also terrified to lose it because im withdrawing and I dont think a two day weekend is enough time to fully recover. Any advice?",3

He's finally decided he just doesn't have the self-control for AA or outpatient treatment and would like to try in-patient care.  I'd just like to make it clear than I'm not writing this because I am pushing him into this - he has trouble reading screens and doesn't like typing.

Here are some pertinent facts that may help someone here help me:

48M living in Eastern Washington

Currently unemployed but receiving unemployment (about $4800/month after-tax. This will go down to $2400/month August 1st).

His employer is going out of business & he may not be reentering the same field due to unrelated health concerns. 

He does not have insurance

He does not qualify for COBRA (I'm 99% sure on this, his employer only had like 3 employees and they're out of business)

He is not religious and would prefer to not go to a program with a strong religious tone

&#x200B;

Ideally, there would be someone he could sit down with who could answer his questions but I'm having trouble finding such a resource.

He's tried going to an outpatient service but they canceled meeting due to COVID-19 and it was in the ballpark of $2500/month after insurance which was too high for him.

&#x200B;

I assume getting insurance is step one.  If in-patient is the goal here, is there a type/provider of insurance that is generally favored over others?

Any input or direction would be greatly appreciated.",1

Growing up as a teenager I had a really bad pornography addiction. I used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence. It made my dating life and sex life horrible. I knew I was better than that, I could not believe this was taking over my life and how could I  let it get this far. So one day I was like fuck this I need to get my life together. I started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies. I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it. I started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer. I EVEN started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography. It was a very tough process but I was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 1/2 months. So the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you. What controls your mind controls your life! Mental toughness!

It's now available for free on iOS and Android.

For the past few months I've been working on Dose. It's an app that allows you to log any recreational drug you've taken. You can then easily see your entries, as well as various stats regarding your use. I think it's worth posting here, because some of you struggle with substance addiction and I hope it can help you.

Here are the key features:

* It is free, no limits, no ads
* Available on iOS and Android
* Works out-of-the-box with many substances included
* See how often you consume, how much you spend and a lot of other meaningful stats
* Attach a note (mood, thoughts) to any entry
* Track any substance you want
* Visualize your use on a calendar
* Secure your data with a PIN code
* Your data is securely stored locally and can be exported anytime
* Dark theme

Please keep in mind that some bugs may still occur.  This is only a ""beta"" version and I'm going to update the app with more features and fixes.

You can get the app [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.doseapp.android), or [download it on iOS here](https://doseapp.io/?ref=raddiction).

The iOS version is not on the App Store yet, but you can install it from the link above. There are some issues with Apple approval, but I hope it'll be available next week.

I’ve since blocked him. I have some nice heavy gelato hybrid to use, I get that weed can equally become abused, but at this point in my life the damages aren’t even comparable to coke. I can sleep, I’m not spending nearly as much  and it doesn’t make me want to put a gun to my head the next day, and I don’t feel shame in using, idk I just know it’s more natural for my mind/spirit, whereas coke is slowly destroying it.

Honestly, I have maybe been sober a total of 3 months in those eight years. I drink anywhere from 2 drinks to 20 on a bad day. I am a 28-year-old female, 5'7 and 130 pounds but I seem to have a huge alcohol tolerance it takes a lot for me to actually get drunk now and I end up drinking disgusting amounts of alcohol (I have polished off an entire 20 pack of beer myself in a night). I have tried to get sobber many times but I always seem to find reasons to drink, I have horrible anxiety and depression and I use alcohol to self medicate for the most part but even when I am not feeling down I don't feel love, pleasure, passion or excitement for anything and alcohol seems to fill that void. I also feel more like myself after I have had a few drinks I feel more confident and free I also find any activity more fun when I am buzzed or high. Last year was hard for me I ended up trying to end my life by drinking vodka and taking a handful of prescription pills. I woke up in the hospital in a haze and I just wanted to get back up and do it again but they kept me there for 3 weeks. I saw a psychiatrist and I told her I wanted to work on getting sobber so I was put in a day program. It was fine but I am such a shy person and relied so much on alcohol to be able to talk to people that I had a hard time expressing myself and eventually felt lost in the crowd so I stopped going. I managed to keep my drinking to a moderate amount of alcohol each night but eventually I let my negative thoughts run away with me and I went back to full-blown alcoholism. I was drinking every day all day from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed. I could not cope with the thoughts in my head anymore and told my self that I did not want to be awake or even alive is I could not have a drink. One day when I was hungover I began throwing up blood so I went to the doctor and he said he could feel my liver so he sent me to the ER, he feared I had cirrhosis of the liver. On my way to the hospital the only thing I was worried about was not being able to drink anymore and it scared me how much I love alcohol. Thankfully after they ran some tests they concluded I did not have cirrhosis but my liver was inflamed from all the drinking. They told me to stop drinking for enough time for it to go back to normal. So I stopped and actually had an easier time with it this time I changed my lifestyle and was doing well for the most part, however life throws you curve balls and I have lost my strength several times and still turned to the bottle. It has now been a year since that ER visit and I am still struggling I have managed to stop getting drunk and only have one or two beers socially. I am trying to love myself and take better care of myself but some days I think what's the point? I have probably already done all sorts of irreparable damage to my body and I have been reading about links between alcoholism and certain cancers and I feel like my futures look pretty bleak. Sometimes I am not sure if it is just too late for me. Has anyone else ever had these feelings?**",3

Growing up as a teenager I had a really bad pornography addiction. I used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence. It made my dating life and sex life horrible. I knew I was better than that, I could not believe this was taking over my life and how could I  let it get this far. So one day I was like fuck this I need to get my life together. I started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies. I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it. I started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer. I EVEN started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography. It was a very tough process but I was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 1/2 months. So the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you. What controls your mind controls your life! Mental toughness!

Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for my sixteen year old brother. I had a very odd conversation with a friend of his earlier, and knew the friend was on something, but I thought my brother could handle himself. 

Fast forward a couple of hours, and my mom rushes from the house to get him with no explanation. She returns with my slurring, sobbing baby brother, who apparently adopts a ‘blaccent’ when high. He spent about two hours pacing and crying and talking nonsense before finally passing out on the sofa. We still don’t know what he’s taken. 

Now, I’m itching for a fix after so much talk of it earlier, while simultaneously being devastated over my brother. I watched that kid grow up, he’s still a chubby cheeked eight-year-old with a bowl cut to me. I don’t want to see him pour his life away like every other member of this family. I will never forgive myself if he is/becomes addicted.",4
2020-05-28 21:37:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gsjgyd/all_i_want_is_to_feel_normal_again/,All I want is to feel normal again.,"Obligatory ""long post and also I'm on mobile"" warning.

This is me admitting that I have a problem. I've ruined myself. Ruined my body, but especially ruined my mind. 

I thought that as long as I stayed away from crack, meth and heroin I would be fine, but obviously that was stupid and didn't work out. ANow all the mistakes I've made are catching up to me. I feel like I've been roped into so much, nothing is in my control anymore. I was supposed to have so much potential, I was going to go to medical school to work in mental health (psychiatric-oriented pharmacist) and help people struggling with addiction because I didn't want to see other people end up like my mother, but now it looks like I'm becoming one of those other people. I haven't even graduated high school yet and I'm already facing felony charges that will ruin everything that I had set up for myself. I was so high when the cops questioned me that I gave them too much information, so now I've dug another hole for myself that I'm going to have to find a way out of. I can't afford a lawyer either. If I'm found guilty there's no way that I'm going to make it into the field, the current drug policy enforced by the US focuses on punishment, not recovery. There's a reason we have a ridiculously high recidivism rate here. 

Excessive use has turned my GPA from a 4.0 to around a 2.4. I can't get caught up on schoolwork because the amount of missed assignments that I've compiled is too overwhelming to complete.

The only word that truly reflects how I feel after destroying my brain is ""retarded"". There's no other way to put it. I hate using slurs like that to describe anything, even myself, but it's the only word I can think of. I'm so slow now. I'm in a constant fog, I can never think straight (which explains why this post might seem somewhat incoherent). My cognitive abilities have gone to shit and I'm just a husk. My pre-existing memory loss has only gotten worse, along with my ongoing issues with psychosis. I can't even do basic math anymore. I had a 98% in the advanced math course and an A in AP chemistry, but now I can't grasp any of the concepts in those classes whatsoever. My teachers are worried and all I want is to be left alone so I can either sleep or get high to avoid my problems.

My dad hates me now. He can't trust me whatsoever. There's no way to have a conversation with him that doesn't deteriorate into an argument about x or y thing I did that he's angry about, no matter the subject. Every time I try to talk he eventually brings something up and it turns out the same as every other discussion I have with him nowadays, usually me slamming the door or hanging up the phone. My fuck-ups already occupy virtually all of my thoughts as it is, I can't stand hearing about it from other people. It's irritating to hear shit that you already know and have been ruminating about. He doesn't know how to help so he just gives ""advice"" based on hindsight. ""You shouldn't have started smoking,"" ""you should have come home earlier,"" ""you should have done this,"" ""you shouldn't have done that."" I know he's trying to help but he doesn't understand. I don't get it, he was married to an addict for almost a decade, yet still questions why I use. I'm not going to blame him, you can't force someone to understand something that they fundamentally don't get.

I've lost my closest friends because of the way I've acted, they see how fucked up I am and decide that they just can't handle exposing themselves to me. Who would? From an outsider's perspective I'm nothing but trouble at this point. I'm constantly terrified of ruining more people, having them turn out like me.

The ""friends"" that I did hang out with took so much from me. One who did crack stole all of my video games, including a GameCube that my mom gave me. I don't care about the rest. I don't care that the switch games were worth $450+. I just want that GameCube back, but it was pawned so long ago and I'm never seeing it again. It was priceless to me and he sold it for what would be maybe a couple minutes of bliss. Others stole different things. Overall the other addicts that I hung out with stole over a thousand dollars worth of my things. The only thing that makes me feel any better is the fact that I've never stooped as low as them, stealing from my friends and family to get my next fix.

At this point I'm used to having nothing. Material items don't make me happy anymore anyways, all I care about now is drugs. The only form of happiness I can feel is the fake, fleeting euphoria that getting high gives me. I've turned into such a hedonistic person and it disgusts me.

Everything is overwhelming. I can't even off myself to take the pain away because I'm too scared of whatever is or isn't on the other side.

The worst part? All of this is my fault. I just make it look like I'm the victim because I can't stand facing the consequences of my actions.

tl;dr: I got myself into a lot of shit, life sucks, and I just want to be normal again.",3

I've been lurking this sub and others pertaining to drug addiction for a while now and finally worked up the courage to post about my stuggle. Sorry for any formatting issues I'm on mobile. Also this is a throwaway account I made for obvious reasons.

When I(28 f) tried my first perc I was 20. Not even bc of a medical issue or anything like that. The city I lived in like many others in the U.S. had a terrible opiate epidemic, everyone and I mean EVERYONE around me was taking it. At first it wasnt that bad I would only take it once every 2 or 3 weeks. Well it from from once in a while to once a week, to 3 times a week, to everyday, to multiple times a day in the span of a few months. This went on for almost 2 years. Around that time I met my now ex-husband. He knew I would take them and at first he didnt think it was that bad, he thought that I only did it for fun (which unfortunately as I mentioned before was quite normal where we were) he would give me money for it, or I would ask for money for other things and spend it on that. However as time went on and the relationship got more serious he noticed what was really happening with me. We eventually got to a point where he was the one giving it to me, bc I refused to stop. He would buy 2 scripts a month and give me 2 pills a day (I thought, at first, that he was doing this bc he loved me and it was getting too expensive to buy them individually from the street, but I now know that he was using this addiction to control me) 

This went on for another year. Around that time (idk what happened, something about the fda taking control of opiate pills or something) there would be complete droughts on the streets for days at a time. This really didnt work out well for me physically bc I had been doing them everyday for 3 years at this point. So a few days out of the month I would go through withdrawal, until I found a new solution to my problem. Suboxone. It was perfect, I was able to make one 8mg strip last 4 days. The problem was trying to take opiates after suboxone. You dont get high. That was a huge problem for me so I decided to switch to suboxone completely. No the high wasnt nearly as good but it was a high and it was cheap. I havent been able to stop since and trust me I've tried. In the years to follow I got married and had 2 kids. I didnt want to get married and have kids especially with the state I was in but my husband wanted to. Like REALLY wanted to (some background: we both come from middle eastern backgrounds, getting married and having kids is a must especially at a young age. He was already 31 at this point so he was behind according to him and his family, even though he already had 1 child from a previous marriage, that apparently wasnt enough) he said if I didnt want to then he would have to leave me for someone else that would, like an arranged marriage, and we would be done, which would also mean my supply would be cut off. My steady supply of 2 years would one day just be cut off. I know this is no excuse but I couldnt think of anything but that.

And this is where I'm going to end this part of the story I'm sorry I wanted to post it all at once but it's really long. I'll try to post part 2 up tomorrow or the day after the latest. If you read this far thank you soo much:) and pls go easy on me in the comments, even if I dont deserve it, I'm still trying to navigate this horrible position I put myself in. Thanks again",3

My name is Ben, and I'm an alcoholic. Today is 20 days sober.

While going through inpatient treatment these past few weeks, I'm starting to recognize the sporadic effects of post-acute withdrawal and today the most crippling symptom is the most prominent: fog brain.

I've always prided myself on my ability to articulate but today I cannot get one thought in front of the other, and it's frustrating the shit out of me. I'm having a terrible time listening and following in group meetings even though I'm desperately seeking to. I can't find the words and my wires feel crossed.

But my brain seems particularly stubborn about healing itself.  I'll rack up some solid sober time but things don't seem to get better.  I have EXTREME fatigue on a daily basis despite exercise, a healthy diet, plenty of sleep, etc.  It's virtually impossible to function or perform any physical tasks without unhealthy amounts of caffeine.  Brain fog is still a major issue.  Memory is still dreadful.  Most things seem incredibly unappealing/boring.  Try to learn anything new is a long and painstaking endeavor.

It just doesn't make sense to me.  I was never a super hardcore drug abuser.  I used just about every drug at some point, but the hard drugs I never used for very long.  And the past few years have been struggling with mainly alcohol/weed/kratom.  But I've had many more days sober than not during this time,  with several longer (3-6 month) stretches of sobriety.  It's just difficult to maintain hope when hard-earned milestones like 6+ months clean don't show much promising change.  I can't wrap my head around the idea that it'll possibly take YEARS of 100% sobriety for me to feel even SLIGHTLY better.  Why is my brain so damn stubborn?

Any insights?",3

I sit there and my mind does what it always does, spinning the future and the past, spinning my self image as I sit there in front of what I always do, and then I give in. And I am weak. And I'm worried about this self image of myself as weak because I know a lot of people don't think it is good to call yourself that. But I am. Or I perceive myself as this way. But is that something you can change in that moment? You have to try harder I guess, but don't we give up because we don't think we can go any longer. Maybe it's just a matter of consistently pushing yourself over and over and over longer and longer until before long you are far from the weak person you used to be. Or is it a matter of focusing your mind on the situation and using your other strengths to change the situation. It's like...at what point does it just come down to staring down the bottle and willing yourself to stop. I could change the whole world to set myself up to never do it and I feel like I'd just tear it all down again and again back to the same old crap.

&#x200B;

But how can you see yourself as stronger than you perceive yourself you know? Is it really just discipline? is that all there is to it? or is it understanding that you are stronger than you think? How can you perceive this in yourself without going through it. I guess I am confused a little

&#x200B;

I can operate like my mind is playing tricks on me, but at what point does that work. That leads to foolishness. It's like...if you ignore your thoughts and your perceptions then you are lying to yourself. You start to lose touch with yourself and what is accurate and what is not. Granted there is no proof that the current thought process you have at the moment is accurate either, but isn't it the best thing you have to do on? if you deny your perception on the basis of belief you lose touch with yourself.

It started with Xanax and I found out this week he’s doing meth. He just got kicked out of rehab and has no where to go. He lives several hours away and I can’t do much of anything. 

We’ve been texting/ talking in the phone on and off and he’s says how empty he feels and that he’s began to experienced psychosis from smoking meth. He’s expressed suicidal thoughts. It’s destroying me seeing him destroy himself. A year ago he was on track to become a doctor and know he’s on the streets. I just don’t understand. I keep telling him what he should do and that he need to get away from the people giving him drugs but he just doesn’t listen. He knows it’s wrong. He knows it’s destroying him and he does it anyway. 

I’ve never been so frustrated and so sad. And I can’t do anything about it. He’s several hours away and I don’t have a car. I’m terrified ones day he’s not gonna respond to his messages and I’m gonna find out he ODd. Or he becomes someone I don’t recognize. Telling him what he should do just doesn’t work. I know addiction is extremely difficult to break, but I’m trying my best to remind him that he’s in control and he has the power to get himself out of this, despite how hard it may be. 

As I’m writing this he says he’s with strangers who do meth, I’m blowing up his phone telling him to get away from them but he isn’t listening. I told him he needs to go the Salvation Army, I called for him and everything he just has to get himself there but he’s not even doing that. 

I just don’t know what to do. I want to help him but there’s nothing I’m doing that is working. What do I do.",1

The path to today hasn’t been a smooth one. I’m not 1 year clean from all drugs, hell not even from all stimulants. But I can safely say I have not taken any amphetamines or prescribed stimulants for one year. And I think that’s pretty good.

Adderall was always my biggest problem. I’ve got real bad ADHD and had a prescription for years, but abused the hell out of it. But I’m working day by day to manage my symptoms unmedicated, and we’re getting there, slowly but surely. 

If I can do it, you can do it too, my friends. We are incredibly strong and there’s nothing you can’t do. You all have the power. I know you do. Good vibes to all of you and stay up :)",82

2020-05-27 02:53:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gren4z/im_sick_of_myself/,I'm sick of myself.,"PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:

I don't know, like I have become this insufficient antisocial adult. Many people including my parents said I'm born to do great things, but I've misused my freedom to a large extent. I've had minimum attendance in college, have very low grades (Im ineligible for international higher studies, or a high paying job), wasted hell lot of money on coaching classes, that I bunked too and spent time mostly on cigarettes, alcohol and weed. I wasn't like this as a kid, was a class topper and in the middle was a low and upper performer in school days you know. 

Mostly my performance would go down when I was enjoying with friends. My friend planned once in 9th grade to smoke a cigarette inside my school, I bought some chewing gums and my English teacher caught me, she called my dad and I got some tight scolding. Then I started smoking and hiding outside school. Never got into any trouble. Secured good grades in 10th grade. Then poor grades in 11th. Then again good grades in 12th. 

Got admission at a good private college. Took a very hard branch there (Mechanical Engineering) a big mistake. Though I've made some really good friends there, I just survived four years of my college without using my brain much. Like I'm naive and wicked at the same time. Didn't study well in the crucial years of college (2nd, 3rd and 4th year). I have mostly D's in my grade sheet. Hated engineering to the core. I basically started with chain smoking (from 2-3 cigarettes a day to 10 cigarettes a day) during my 4th semester. Then tried weed in 5th semester. At that time, I'd find a chance to smoke weed with many friends. I'd intentionally go to those friends who were smoking 420. I've bought weed as well, which is a sin (according to a middle class guy). In college, it was an on-off thing, I wasn't smoking regularly. Then in 8th semester, we only had to make a project. So I mostly stayed in a flat. That was the time when I started abusing the substance with bongs and joints. Jacking off after smoking up feels so good. But the worst part is that I lost interest in the activities that I enjoyed doing.

I have severe rapid memory loss now and I've become this cynic and narcissistic now who is jealous of his friends getting high paying jobs (since they took interest in engineering, scored good grades and have relevant skills). Even before I started these addictions I was on social media adding girls as friends because of my high libido, made some false rumours about 2 girls and hurt their dignity (in 10th and 11th grade). I'm about to turn 23 next month and I'm incapable of doing anything in life. No one would marry me as well. I have infatuation for light skinned and attractive women only (though I'm dark skinned), thanks to porn. My lies have pulled me down and made me an unproductive member of the society.

FINAL NOTE: I've wasted a lot of my father's hard earned money on weed (and also paraphernalia), alcohol (both beer and hard liquor), cigarettes, hookah and condoms (haven't had sex, I just use it for masturbating (it's much hygienic to decompose)).

Though I'm 197 days weed free and 152 days cigarette free, I don't think I'll achieve anything in life. I'm grateful that I've got parents who still care for me. The reality is that I've betrayed my innocent and hard working parents. I didn't study for my college placements and I haven't taken proper treatment for my alcohol overdose also, and I am an utter failure in my life. I regret going to college and having a degree with no use and mediocre grades.

I have substance induced schizophrenia (with only one symptom i.e. laughing alone), social anxiety and rapid memory loss, and poor decision making skills. I'm unemployable as well. I have low self esteem. I have a dysfunctional brain as well. Also, I'm suffering my ignorance and I've lost my mental faculties.",3

Prior to that, I used it a lot in the early 2010s.... I forgot how shitty it feels to come off this stuff....

But it’s not as shitty as the way it feels to use it anymore. For whatever reason, within the pay month, anytime I smoke/dab, I get severe lung pain, wheezing, tightness in my chest and shortness of breath that lasts for days!!! I last smoked 24 hours ago and I’m still struggling to get a full breath in, can’t go up and down the stairs of my house without feeling like I marathon. Last time it was this bad, I had smoked multiple bowls, and had multiple dabs through the day.... this time, I only had 3 small bowls of flower.... this sucks dudes. The wife is quitting to and oh boy is it making those moods swing. SUPPORT ME BROHS. I can’t be 30 y/o and struggling to breathe like this. And before anyone asks, I have a dr appointment tomorrow to address this.... I’ve seen some research papers that long term cannabis use can lead to your lungs rejecting due to the irritation it causes.

I know most people seem to think weed is harmless, and for most, I believe it is.... but it seems to be killing me right now. I’ll argue against anyone that says weed smoke is harmless, same with vaping. I even took my dabs small, and low temp. My lungs only feel this way after consuming cannabis..... it sucks broghs. Maybe don’t do it multiple times every day? Don’t take 9 dabs through out the course of the day???? Idk man.... it sucks. I had one last edible I just ate, and it’s kicking in (25mg, pretty small for me. Usually I send myself in to Narnia on the back of my 150mg weed gummies) so hopefully I can get some good sleep.

Btw, I love you bro’s. I don’t comment much but I read most of y’alls stories and posts n shit, and I appreciate what all y’all have been through/are going through..... 

Ps: my wife is going gold turkey after also consuming daily for 5 years... I tried to stress that this is gonna suck but uh..... I think it’s gonna be worse for me. Mood swinging like a swinging couple in a swingers club..... k... I’m done.",4

He hasn’t smoked weed since his release but wants to. I think that if we make a big deal out of weed, and he abstains from it, then thats just one more hurdle for him, in the sense that if he “falls off the wagon” for smoking weed, it might derail him completely. So i think it might be better for him to just smoke weed as normal, like he smokes cigarettes and has coffee so it wont be associated with hardcore drugs and it loses it’s power to derail him into the dangerous substances.

Hey all!

I'm Margaret from [Osmind](https://www.osmind.org/). I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania, and I'm currently working with a team of Stanford graduate students on Osmind, a care platform (completely free to join!) for those interested in FDA-approved medicine for treatment-resistant depression.

Our platform comes with a [forum](https://members.osmind.org/) for members to interact/socialize. Especially during times like this, we want to do anything we can to help cultivate a supportive and open community. We've hosted 4 AMAs so far, and on Wednesday (5/27) 11am PT, we're so lucky to be hosting [another AMA with George Taktak and Mark Anscombe](https://members.osmind.org/t/ama-on-wed-5-27-how-mental-founders-mental-health-advocacy-and-social-media-organization-osmind-featured-on-howmental-instagram-live-today-5-26-at-11am-pt/376), founders of How Mental, a well-known mental health advocacy group. George is also the founder of Feeliom, an app designed to care for your wellbeing by staying in touch with yourself and your loved ones. Mark is the founder of Perspective Project, a charity tackling mental health stigma through art and creativity.

We'd love for you to join the forum (completely free) and ask whatever questions you have. You can post your questions on the forum beforehand, and our special guests will be typing answers to those questions live during the time of the AMA! To be clear, the AMA will take place on [**Osmind's forum**](https://members.osmind.org/t/ama-on-wed-5-27-how-mental-founders-mental-health-advocacy-and-social-media-organization-osmind-featured-on-howmental-instagram-live-today-5-26-at-11am-pt/376), not Reddit (so post your questions on there, not this post).

Some topics that they can speak to:

1. Lived experience of anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies and trauma.
2. Changing the narrative around mental health - starting our own movement. What you can do to contribute to the broader movement.
3. How to prioritize your mental wellbeing - proactive care and prevention.
4. Mental Health & Technology.
5. Mental Health & Art.

Let me know if you have any questions about Osmind and what we're doing, would love to talk more :)

Best,

Margaret",1

First off I wanna say how proud I am of all of you who have beaten addictions, I can't imagine how hard it is so know I am so proud I am of all of you. And to the people still battling, you are all so very strong I truly believe in you :) Now I would love some advice if you could give it. For many months I have been battling addiction, but not my own. Someone very very important to me. This person makes me smile everytime I see them or talk to them, I have never met anyone quite like them, someone truly one of a kind Incredibly intelligent and such a beautiful heart. What is sad, is that unfortunately they have had a life growing up around drugs and alcohol and anger; they have not had it easy at All, from birth to now. Parents abandoned them, never properly loved, horrible abusive relationships, no sense of hope ever. In fact I was the first person that actually truly cared and was there for them, and I really truly am. I just don't know what to do. It pains me and tortures me to see and know of their drug abuse. cocaine, lsd, and so many more, and lots and lots of alcohol. They use these drugs to numb themselves because they have been in mental and physical pain their whole Life, and tried ending their life before. I've had nights where they get too drunk and their truth comes out, they end up crying in my arms for hours about how they hate their life and how they dont want to be broken and how they just want their mom (her mom isn't around, she's been living on her own since 16), and then they act like everything is fine the next day. It's truly heartbreaking, and I am an intense empath so it physically pains me every hour of every day because of this. All I want is for her to be Okay and safe, and I no longer want to wake up everyday worrying that she took too much of something thst night and I can no longer see her again. But I can't do much, I'm almost 18 and trying to live y own Life, but this pain is consuming me. I would love if any of you that have been through addiction woudk give me advice on what I could or should do, anything at all would be very much appreciated. This is one of my last attempts for help, I didn't know where to go for proper Advice, I hope I can find something here. Thank you for reading, stay strong. <3",2

She left a solid middle-class childhood with a great car, a free ride to college, and room & board available with mom. Instead of making use of those privileged opportunities she failed most of her way through community college, barely achieving an AA. She destroyed the car, parents got her another, and she promptly crashed that one too. My mom’s her own brand of WTF, but is quite gracious in what she expects in return from a roommate for covering cost of rent, utilities and food (i.e. a little acknowledgement and respect), yet my perennially unemployed, couch-potato POS sister is incapable of putting her dishes away or wearing underwear (I am so over of hearing my mom bitch about sisters princess slime on the sofa!).

Sister has been fired from: McDonalds, Krispie Kreme, Goodwill. When she’s secured her own vehicles through shameless begging to friends on Facebook, she’s wrecked every single one (I’ve lost count, but we’re past 7). She never brushes her teeth and refused to wear a retainer, thus destroying over $10,000 of orthodontic work my parents provided for her, TWICE. She’s wracked up $8,000 worth of debt, been bailed out, repeated. Now she’s at 15k in debt, along with a 14k claim against her because she once again crashed a car, this time while driving without insurance. Now she’s trying to scramble together 3k (through more begging) for a downpayment on a brand new Kia Soul (i.e. she has no perspective on money, debt, learning to live cheap, sucking it up and riding a bike). This is only describing the shit I even know about. She’s NEVER forthcoming.

AND she’s a cocaine addict, though based on the prices she’s paying she’s unwittingly snorting crack. Sadly it’s the one thing that actually kept her motivated to work, delivering for GrubHub to pay for her next line.

Every place she’s ever stayed at she’s been kicked out of. Lying is constant. She falls for get-rich-quick schemes and has implicated my mom’s credit as well as my dad’s bank account in her shady dealings. There is never a sorry, thank-you, actions of gratitude or acknowledgement of personal responsibility. NEVER! She just says everyone is an asshole and doesn’t understand her debilitating depression. And she’s covered in open sores all over her body from picking. Fucking crackhead, right?

…but there must be more…

My sister was born prematurely. Mom slipped on ice when she was 7 months pregnant. Sister was speech delayed and put in special ed, then pushed into the normal stream of kids and swept along with the current. There was (and still is) difficulty maintaining eye contact; caught in a lie her eyes flicker manically back and forth. She’s never been much of a talker, doesn’t join into conversations, and if you ask her anything about herself it’s like she’s incapable of answering. Hygiene has ALWAYS been an issue, along with following rules. School was always a struggle, especially reading comprehension. Even today if you ask her about a movie she just watched, she can’t give you a tight summary. Psychologists diagnosed her as ADHD and put her on pills, which she never enjoyed taking and I don’t think ever did regularly. Noises trigger the fuck out of her: when I’d practice piano, she’d have howling meltdowns to the point that I gave it up because it wasn’t worth the trouble. When she finds a video or TV show she likes, she obsesses. There was a summer where every morning she was glued to the screen watching the film version of Godspell. This is to say I’m pretty sure she’s on the autism spectrum.

In our family dynamics I always knew something was up. My parents constantly failed at following through on consequences with her, and I remember being 10 y/o and screaming at them that time out means time out. As my sister approached legal adulthood and showed 0 signs of maturity I chased after them, saying they had a year left to send her to bootcamp or wilderness therapy or SOMETHING other than the laissez-faire attitude they took. But they didn’t listen. “Sink or swim” they said. Then they started bailing her out, only to discover that did nothing, and now (dad particularly) has said she’s no longer his responsibility. Whose is it then? Society’s? Your kid is a coke addict with some other kind of mental dysfunction that never got diagnosed or dealt with! In my opinion, abandonment is not okay.

She’s been to a therapist as an adult for eating disorder, depression and skin picking. She eats like a child: chocolate cereal, vanilla wafers, ritz crackers and hot pockets. The sores on her arms and legs, combined with the worst tattoos, scream methhead, though I’ve no confirmation that meth is in the drug mix she’s dabbling in, and it could just be excoriation, which my mom has suffered from in times of high stress. My dad and I both went to a joint therapist session and I brought up the Autism question, and the therapist said she didn’t think so. But then what’s my sisters deal? I’m unwilling to conclude she’s pathetically narcissistic. There is NPD in the family (MOM!), but my sister had dad and myself around to balance that shit out. I’m just left asking What The Fuck!?

I want to be there to help her, but don’t know how. There’s the drug problem, which is clear cut. But what’s the missing link? Is she just a fuck-up, or is the fuck-up all the adults around her failing to figure out her out her deal so that she can be given the tools for a successful life? And how the hell can I (or anyone) be there for her compassionately but without enabling? Currently she’s carless, shacked up with some 40 year-old weirdo whose likely exchanging drugs for sex, and has 0 job prospects other than what can be done as app gig work. She was offered a roof over her head with mom, where I’ve been staying during the pandemic too, but she’s angry at both of us because we’re unwilling to ignore her horribly rude behavior in the house or the glaring drug problem.

Diagnosis is against the rules, so let me specify that I want to help my sister, but feel lost, and could just use some pointers on which roads to travel down. Seeking any reading recommendations, organizations, and personal anecdotes that might help me be there for her. Also need to beef up my argument against my dad’s “She’s an adult, no longer my responsibility” bullshit, because I don’t agree with him one bit.

HELP!",14

(& man has it been a process!) I have been sharing our encounters on here a lot & typing it all out has really been validating my sense of understanding to see the truth and the actual reality of what it is shes doin,"Okay, so I don't know if everyone reading this is familiar with narcissism but it's something I've basically been forced to understand in my life as when it is something you encounter you really don't even have a choice but to eventually start seeking answers and looking for help...

So I'm not sure why but all of a sudden I guess having to write this all out right now... it actually is starting to make me feel a little bit hopeless. I guess the truth of the reality is that my mom is a caretaker... So she basically takes care of an older couple right now and helps them to make sure their needs are met. It's weird I sort of feel like I am having an empath moment all of a sudden but it's actually finally dawning on me the extent of how real this situation really is.

So I have been working on my own youtube channel now for like almost a few months... Prior to that I have been a college student for a year and beings that I am 24 I have been basically working more or less full time since I had finally graduated high school...

My story is pretty long and extensive and I think that it would probably take me a whole longer to try and sum this up but basically because of some sexual abuse that I had encountered as a teenager... and my dad having more or less abandoned me for his new drunken biotch of a girlfriend (wife now... and man oh man do i hate that woman..!)

So basically around senior year I ended up living back with my mom and brother and sister because my dad had basically gone entirely off the rails with his piece of crap new life purpose... chasing this home-wrecking whore... (not a fan of the word but sometimes it applies, oh well!!!!!)

So needless to say I was a drunk. I was an alcoholic. I was 17 and I was lost. My dad completely abandoned me to the point they were out partying and I would be stuck at the house... literally no electric and all kinds of shiz. (I never would have complained but they were starting to lose their shit as well so I was constantly being mistreated and scapegoated and more or less yelled at and insulted all of the time!) My dad became somebody I had never knew or seen before in my life....

So there I am back at my moms with my brother and sister... The reason that I had never chosen to be with them in the first place is because believe it or not my dad was actually the better person. He was the good one. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't perfect, but you know I guess perhaps a little too naively, as far as I was concerned, he was close.

My mom on the other hand was violent, distant, unloving, inconsiderate, and cold. Always, always, very, very cold. Trying to reach out to her was like trying to get along with a vampire... all she saw in me as a child was opportunity, weakness, and vulnerability... and I suppose that was all that I ever was...

I don't know if anyone is familiar with narcissism but I have a channel on it for background information if anyone is interested... I know that the resources of information that I have found HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY LIFE SAVING TO ME!!!!!  There are also better experts on the topic that I can point you to if anyone is more interested in the information than what I have prepared to offer them on my own channel so far!

So basically at this point both of my parents are narcissists. So I don't know when exactly it all started with my mom or how it started but I guess that is just something that I am going to have to figure out. All I remember about my senior year living with my mom was that we were staying at her friend Dave's house... who lived alone in a decent sized house so I guess he was doing her/us a solid.... and he works at a liquor store so he has and had a full blown bar and variety of alcohol in his home. I was already pretty used to drinking pretty regularly at the time so when I was going to school every other day senior year... and nobody else would be home at the time... I was more or less passed out drunk most days even before something like 4 p.m. Everybody was at work.. and when they finally got home I made it a point to wobble up the steps and ""take a nap.""

All I remember about the next few years (as far as this post is concerned I guess anyway) is working, (I got a job housecleaning a few months after graduation) drinking, going out to party with friends, and arguing with my mom.

My sister eventually ended up having my beautiful niece and I was still battling pretty crippling depression, add, obsessive compulsive and god only knows what else. Definitely at times I was more than bordering on psychosis and I know now that especially the drinking was not helping.

I was desperate to get away from my mom and family who for whatever reason only ever seemed to make me feel worse about myself... (I come from a religious family so while I was battling trying to understand my own struggles with ""mental health"") I continuously was finding myself being forced into conversations about my relationship with God... evil spirits... you know, the devil... whatever... (this I have to say was definitely not helping my mental health at the time!!! only made me more fearful, confused!)

So I ended up dating some pretty terrible guys who to my surprise of course because I was a dumb naive and mentally dissociated imbecile, were only using me for for my vehicle and money/paychecks from working so that they could supply themselves with their hefty doses of disgusting potent drugs... i.e. heroin. I barely knew at the time the first time around because pills and especially that hard of a drug was just something I guess I was sort of closing my eyes to since I wasnt really familar and nonetheless was barely in a situation where I could honestly even ever say that I knew what I was doing...

So I somehow miraculously survived those years.... I was in and out of the legal system, which I suppose to my own benefit, did actually serve to me to eventually and finally straighten me out and get me back on the right track! (I was never a bad kid.... trust me... I was smart, talented kind... I had just totally and completely lost who I was, so I respected the authorities more or less because as far as I was concerned they were probably the only actual ""adults"" that might have a hint or clue as to what I should as far as my own, and sort of just like some well needed guidance into a better direction!!!)

It didn't happen over night... but eventually I did like a year in counseling, and group and such... I got sober, I finally started taking meds appropriately (which work better when youre not always drinking.... apparently!!!!) And so basically I guess for the past like 2 years now almost... I have been clean from hard drugs... (I eventually got sucked into making the worser choices the second time around... that is the second junkie I succumbed to out of pure misplaced and unguided desire for love...) But thank the heavens above I never became much of a drug addict... Truthfully, the first time I had even tried heroine my ""friend"" lied to me about what it was... and the first time I ever smoked crack I'm sure I was probably half drunk...

Miraculously, and probably undeservingly... I did somehow survive...

Now I have been focusing on my mental and emotional recovery and my college for like I said almost 2 years... And yet now, somehow I am still somehow struggling and battling to get a long with my own family whilst still living in their house.

I think the crazy part about all this, is that there is still SO SO SO much more to this story.... and so much more to my family, and I guess my friends, and my life that I should probably try and take the time to understand...

But I guess the really unfathomable part about this all, is that I am still somehow not the victim... (not that I ever particularly cared to be I guess, I just wanted I guess maybe just a little bit... maybe SOME credit where it was due...) but somehow it is still my mom who somehow is desperate to keep me around in this manipulative sort of power struggle I guess where she is somehow still half afraid, reluctant or maybe just embarrassed what all it is that she has done with her life so far...

I wouldn't even really know where to start with her... but she doesnt communicate honestly and every time we try to go and discuss things with one another there is a power struggle...

Anyway, this isn't where I was expecting this post to go this morning because I had planned on trying to sort out the conversation that we had just had... but I think more or less what it all actually boils down to... is that she is scared of losing me... I think she knows as a 24 year old woman, I probably am not and wont actually be here too, too, too much longer... I'm supposed to carry on, move on, and get on with my own life...

& It's not that I ever really intently planned on not including her... it's just that every time I try to go and share or actually include her... she tries to cover up more and more a piece of who I actually am... and I really dont know how else to wrap this up but the truth is I am somehow who is far far smarter than her... (and I dont even mean that disrespectfully!) I am someone who is going to far, far, far, surpass her in life.... I'm someone who's not particularly religious but Im also not against it and Im not a bad person... I have morals.... I have rights.... I have purpose....

And as a psychology major and someone who has spent the past year basically trying to pull my head out of this fog... I can see now that she is a narcissistic manipulator... who is just dishonestly trying to include herself into my own life... I can see that she doesn't think that I would be friends with her unless she emotionally abused me into hypervigilance... just so I would be too scared to leave... and otherwise I wouldnt stick around... I can see that she doesn't have the human capacity to admit just who she actually is... I can see that she is still just trying to live a lie.... I can see that she is still somehow expecting me.... to still somehow just do it for her..... :/ :/ :/ :/

(anyway there is far, far more to this, but I figured this was a good place to start...) If you dont understand what being a narcissist... It's when youre working out and your mother tries to have a conversation with you and then guilt trips you because your panting to hard to try and talk and accuses you of ""ignoring her..."" It's being told you have an attitude when she asks you a question and you answer it without adding any additional unnecessary information... It's when your guilt tripped into thinking that you are somehow always doing something wrong... It's when you think that you owe somebody something even when you are just constantly working trying to help pay her bills and contribute your fair share to the community and just trying to pay rent.... It's never being good enough.... It's being expected to always stick around... Because its her who is so selfishly and desperately, and naively scared.... of actually being abandoned...

soon i developed into a poly-addict with a small psychoactive pharmacy thats always present in my pocket. calm, as long as i was medicated. one day i was sitting on a bench staring at the beach with a cigarette ashing' on my shirt from neglect, i just had it. wondering at what point i lost meaning and trying to remember when did this cloud of smoke that floats above my head became my best friend. suddenly a bird comes and shits on my face! just kidding..


 suddenly a small child comes, he had a small car toy in his hand and he starts moving it on the other end of the bench making unrealistic car noises, i looked at him and thought: great.. a fuckin' kid. ""you look sad"" said the fuckin' kid. -who me? not at all, its a beautiful day.. ""adam"" his mom called. the kid waved and left.  after the kid left i said to myself sarcastically, it is a beautiful day indeed. i started noticing the beach, the sun, the birds, the people, the sound of the waves. it was peaceful 

  then a crazy idea dawned to me ""what if all of my sadness were a choice?"" sure my problems are still there but what if im deciding to deal with them in a way that is not serving me. im sure everyone here also have shit in their lives. i kept thinking about this on my way home. it felt like i was standing outside myself, becoming aware of my thoughts and how they shaped my emotions and behaviours & habits. i reached home, entered my room and for the first time i saw how messy it was. 

i mean i knew it was messy but it never was a problem enough to change. it made me feel bad, so i decided to clean it. when i finished it i felt so much better, i decided then that maybe i deserved better. i decided to quit drugs, change my friends & become a happy person. as silly as that sounds.. withdrawal were horrible but i didn't relapse. i spent the next month in self isolation. studying about the mind, self improvement, building better habits, appreciation. 

fast forward its been two years now & im the most positive person i know. im happy just because. i enjoy my own company and ive managed to cultivate hobbies that i enjoy doing. the problems in my life are still there and they keep coming every day, but my attitude towards them have changed, i focus on what i can control and accept what i cant as is.

 i still have alot of unanswered questions like what i want in life. but im not anxious from the unknown future and i trust that ill figure things out as i progress..persuing self mastery brings me fulfilment and making things better than i found them and helping people gives me purpose. enjoying the process one step at a time. life is truly a great gift, so much to learn, give & experience.

looking back i would like to thank adam the kid on the beach, his question sparked a cascade of self reflective questions that had a snowball effect which led to the decision that i deserved better. that decision alone changed who i am. 

lastly id like to thank you, the reader for taking the time to read this and hopefully found it valuable. stay positive",6

But basically I've bought weed and sold some of my valuables to buy weed (even though I didn't have money). Initially it wasn't regular, but as far as I remember, I have at times become dependent on it. Wasted a lot of time in obtaining it, learning to make joints, and basically getting wasted and abusing the substance whenever I'd get a chance. Plus college was expensive, without scholarship I completed it. 

Didn't study anything for the placements, have very low grades, and basically did nothing much during 16-22. I have learnt that nobody can save me, but I'm helpless like a child rn. Still staying at home, being a burden to my parents and eating off their bank balance, with no financial backup for myself. Feelings of fear, shame, anger and hatred are there within me now. I'm frightened as fuck about my future. Most probably I'm gonna die a beggar. 

I see myself as a skewed intelligence. I'm crooked, wicked and unkind, a whiny asshole crying over very simplistic things who only knows to waste father's hard earned money on three substances (weed alcohol and cigarettes). I have severe mental illness issues. I was looking for shortcuts to success in college, basically to become a rapper. Didn't work out, also I didn't have good relationships with teachers in my college as well. I'm about to turn 23 next month, and currently I'm 194 days marijuana free.

2020-05-24 08:09:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gponrx/how_can_an_addiction_be_stopped/,How can an Addiction be Stopped?,"1. Identify Your Personal Triggers First.
Each person’s triggers are unique. For some people, getting high or drunk is the direct result of stress. For others, it is the result of just being in the vicinity of a club. Ask yourself:
When do I think about drugs or alcohol the most?
Which situations make me more likely to abuse a substance?
What do I look for from using? Stress release? The ability to forget about responsibilities?
Once you identify what the triggers are, you can then begin to plan a way around them. In other words, you can learn to identify a trigger situation when it occurs and take steps right at that moment to move yourself away from the risk.
2.Avoid Stress.
Many people face stress on a daily basis. At work, school, and at home, you may feel stress begin to creep up throughout the day. There’s no way to eliminate all stress from your life on a regular basis. However, you can learn to recognize when stress is building. Your shoulders tense up. Your head is pounding. All you can think about is getting out of the situation.
When the stress trigger builds, take action at that moment to minimize it as much as possible to avoid turning to alcohol or drugs.
Take a deep breath, close your eyes, and count to 10. In that moment when you need to make a decision not to turn to substances, center yourself.Do something you enjoy. Go for a walk, a swim, or just listen to music.
Work it out. When stress becomes too much, head to the gym to use exercise as a tool for getting rid of the tension.
3.Pull in Others for Help.
For some people, addiction triggers relate specifically to people. Being around the actions of one person can cause you to lose track. When a person or a person’s action is causing you to feel the trigger building, recognize the need to turn to someone for help. Whether you need to reach out for support from your addiction treatment center or just a close friend, don’t wait to get guidance and help.
4.Stay Busy and Motivated.
One common trigger that’s hard to avoid is boredom. You have nothing to do. You don’t want to watch TV and there’s no one to spend time with. This scenario is common for those working towards reintroducing themselves to daily life after treatment. Staying busy helps keep your mind focused on the tasks at hand.
What do you do when you’re bored and thinking about getting high or taking a drink?
Create a list of things you could do. Plan this list in advance. For example, make a to-do list for the week. When you have down time, choose something from the list to do.
Make a point of getting outdoors when you’re bored. Spend some time exploring a local park with a friend. Play some catch. Weed the garden.
Join a new group. Whenever you have downtime, you have an opportunity to meet new people. You can do this through your place of worship, local recreation centers, and through charities. Volunteer your time to help others.
5.Keep Learning.
The more you know about your addiction, the recovery process, and the triggers present throughout your day, the more powerful you are at taking steps to avoid them.
Learn to improve communication with those you love. Work continuously on building strong relationships.
Continue to learn why you are facing addiction and what put you on this path. Do you have co-occurring conditions worsening your risks?
Explore new opportunities in every facet of your life. How can you be a better version of you? Learn a new hobby, explore a new career, take a step towards a meaningful relationship, or learn more about your community.
6.Recognize Your Strengths
Triggers are present in everyone’s life. The way you react to them defines your future. At the Ranch at Dove Tree, we’re a phone call away if you are facing the onset of an addiction trigger right now. Don’t wait to call to seek out help that can keep you on the right path.",6

My dad's side has an issue with addictions. My dad as a I know of with drinking.

I also have issues with addictions. I'm addicted to mastrubating, my phone(I talk about this in a bit) and I listen to music almost the whole day so that's kinda an addiction too. I do Molly on the occasion. 
So about my phone/computer, I'm a huge tech fenatic. It's more of a content addiction, Its just I want more and more content, YouTube videos, news articles for the quick dopamine. 

My mastrubation addiction is the far worst. From 3 to 8 times a day. 

I've been having these addictions for about 3 years now. 
It makes me less motivated for things. Even for gaming im not motivated enough.

I do have ADD(ADHD but without the H) but that is not the issue here, I do have medication that doesn't do a lot because I'm not motivated enough on my own anyways.

It's gotten worse over the years and even came to the point that I failed a whole year because I wasn't motivated for school at ALL. I never ever did ANY homework and learning is impossible for me. In classes I'm always bored not motivated enough for doing the work.

I worked on creating a pretty big and popular website, got it finished but don't have any motivation to update it.

2020-05-23 18:42:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gpea6q/a_new_take_on_the_12_steps/,A new take on the 12 steps,"I don't believe that addiction is a disease. I cannot accept that a chemical can make the human soul submit to it. Even if all we are is a bunch of neurons, it is irrational for someone to throw their lives away because of a short-term high.

No. We got addicted because we couldn't find a better solution to the problem called Life. We got addicted because we couldn't find a deeper meaning to it. Because society raised us to be a mass of spiritually dead nihilists.

I am not here to talk about gods and demons. But think about it. Think about all the people that broke free by finding something to believe in. The A.A. Talk about this too, though in a more close minded way. A man who has found balance in their lives doesn't have to fear any chemical.

I will give you my version of the 12 steps, which helped me leave alcohol and heroin behind me.

1)We accepted that drugs are the best choice a materialist has. They are made to pleasure the brain more than anything else physical is able to. As long as we believe that matter is everything, we are powerless against them.

2)We found something greater than matter. Whether it is a god, spirituality or even just our Egos. When we are addicted we give our souls to our drug of choice. Therefore we must find something that surpasses matter to give it to in order to escape.

3)We found the courage to turn our lives upside down. To destroy the toxic balance we made for ourselves and to replace it with a balance that we truly desire. We need bravery because until we reach that equilibrium we will need to swim in the ""Abyss""

4)We found all the wounds that drove us to addiction.

5)We then found the willpower to heal them. We must become new people if we want to win this fight.

6)We found the problems we use drugs to cover.

7)We dedicated ourselves to solving the ones that can be solved and to accept the ones that cannot.

8)We found the mistakes that we made before and during our use.

9)We asked for forgiveness from those we hurt and we found the power to forgive ourselves.

10)We continued facing and fixing our mistakes.

11)We continued our spiritual journey.

12)And now we are ready to help others.

So I’m a former injection drug user. Cocaine was my drug of choice. I haven’t injected or even had cocaine in 9 months (9 months today actually!). I’m not sober by any means, which I understand may be making my cravings harder to control; I smoke weed pretty frequently, drink alcohol from time and time, but have more or less stayed away from harder drugs. 

My cravings really dropped off and basically disappeared around the 5th month mark of being off the needle. But lately, like the past week or so, I’ve been experiencing pretty strong cravings to shoot up coke again. I’ve been dreaming about it and thinking about it so much lately. 

This pandemic has made things harder for me in recovery. I really lean on my close friends when I’m struggling and I barely get to see them now. I recently bought a raft - during the summers I’m a whitewater raft guide but that probably won’t happen this summer because commercial rafting is on pause. Anyways, I was hoping to go up with my raft to the mountains and river a lot and get a lot of outdoor time with some of the other guides I work with... but I’ve just been so unmotivated and lazy lately. I know I should be more active and doing more things to manage my cravings, but the motivation just isn’t there. 

So I guess I’m asking you all what you do when cravings strike? Especially when you feel depressed and unmotivated to improve your situation. Or any pandemic tricks for being in recovery you’ve picked up along the way? 

I think I just wanted to talk about it too. Sometimes I don’t like telling people close to me that it’s getting kinda bad again because I don’t want to worry them. I dunno. Thanks for reading!",6

  Our memories forever kept safe in a place only we know about. 

  I hope you forgive me, I can’t bring myself to change the wording to past tense. 

  Part of me is holding onto the idea you’re still here just in another sense. 
 
  It kills me that I’ll never know if that’s true. 
Well, I guess not until I come to meet you. 

  I like to think you’re watching over me from time to time. 

  I used to obsess, but now I wait for you to send me down a sign.

All while soaking up sympathy. All while draining others - them not wanting to be around me.

Recently a conversation showed me several things. Later the next day, realized what I was doing. I stopped it dead. It was a shock. I’ve been processing this since last night. Some from the conversation, some I came up with, some I’d seen from somewhere else. This is for me - there’s likely similar elsewhere.

Here’s what I learned:

Many with mental illness complain and do nothing about it because they’re addicted to pain and attention.
(Yes, there are people who can’t - this doesn’t apply to them).

You are not your diagnosis.

You are allowed to make mistakes.

You can’t control what’s already happened.

Knowing when to walk away is knowing your self worth.

It’s okay not to be okay.

You need to let things go.

Come close! 
Let me tell you a secret.. 
I'm in love. 
""With who?"" They say. 
""Since when?"" Again, they. 
""Tell me all about her."" They beg. 
'Well she's amazing you see' 
'Not hard to find her even if you looked the other way' 
'She will make you laugh'
'Make your pain fade' 
'Blow your mind' 
'But she takes everything you have away' 
'You'll love her after only first meeting her' 
'Just don't try to leave her' I explain. 
'She loves you till you want to leave her' 
'She has many lovers but she is your only one' 
""'Don't dare leave me or you'll rue this day'"" she will exclaim. 
She's wicked in so many different ways. 
Don't test her or she'll destroy you from your heart to your brain. 
She'll take your house your car everything
Leave you in love with her again yet this time scarred. 
She takes you away from your family cause she claims 'she's all you'll ever need' 
She is not generous kind caring 
She's evil diabolic and full of greed
""'You take my hand now you're mine and I'm not one for sharing'"" 
'We just met I only know your name. Where did you come from? Who even told you my name?' 
""'I know everything the moment I cross your brain'""
This is scary but she seems so confident and trusting you (take just one walk with her to see how you feel) grab hold of her hand and walk and talk with her for miles. 
'I've never felt so alive around anyone in my life. Can't you see why she's so great?' 
She told me it'll all be okay after the first companion seemed to just float away. 
I still trusted her. 
So again and again I took her hand and walked these limitless miles. 
So alive so bliss it was as if I'd been walking down the wedding aisle. 
Yet no family gathered to witness our matrimony. 
It was her and I. Better yet only I. Just lonely. 
She believed in no love so she took my heart and froze it over. 
Colder and colder until you've felt your heart no longer. 
She's laughed and skipped off with everything. Including the old you. 
She's moved onto another for you have nothing left to offer. 
Say goodbye or do whatever it takes to touch her and regain your high? 
Not many take the path less traveled on. 
So she smiles and waves only looking back to coax you her way. 
'CRYSTAL COME BACK!' Was all I could say. 
'Crystal I love you' 
As your ecstasy fades to grey. 
She said ""'one day I'll be back. Or just come find me some way'"" 
She's left you with nothing. 
Yet the love you hold still remains. 
'I love her but don't need her' 
'Please don't let me need her' I prayed. 
Goodbye Crystal I love you. It's time to go our separate ways. 
My love for you will forever remain. 
Goodbye my love. I'll never forget your name.

I enjoy hiking and fishing and just exploring outside in general, but in the last few months I have not wanted to venture outside but instead opt to play video games with my young so , or just by myself. I play on my laptop, phone, or gaming systems, and it has lead to a large weight gain of almost 75 pounds and lower back pain that can be excruciating at times. How can I change things for the better. Just fyi I use my cellphone on hikes for gps and maps.",1

I used to take focalin and adderall all throughout the day and I quit for a couple months at the beginning of the year. I started taking them again and I don't even know why, but it's really out of hand this time. 
I never thought I'd say this about anything but I'm pretty sure I have a full blown addiction to it. It's not even fun anymore but I keep taking more and more even when I don't really want to. I have no clue why I even started again. When I don't take it I can't do anything. I didn't take it the other day while I was off work and I actually slept for 21 hours, only getting up to use the bathroom. I feel like I can't tell anyone about it or get help because no one even knows I kept taking it after I graduated and I’m ashamed of myself. I started smoking cigarettes again, after quitting for a year because it makes me crave them for some reason. I never smoked that much, but it’s a pack a day now or more. And I get drunk every single night, because if I don't I end up sleeping for 1, maybe 2 hours. If I'm lucky.  Sometimes I don't sleep for days. I'm absolutely miserable at this point.",3

and he just freaked and told me if i didn’t send him a video of me flushing the molly at that exact second he was gonna call my mom and tell her (i have a really toxic relationship w my mom. i’ve told him about her, he knows she is abusive) and i was just so upset that that’s what his first thought was- to call someone who i don’t even talk to and have a serious traumatic past w them ?
he never apologized when i was upset, he says he was in the right to call my mom (he was just gonna look it up he’s never met her) because he “doesn’t know anyone else in my family to call” but like .... that’s bc i don’t talk to my family at all

I've never gone to AA, although I considered in the past (currently sober 160 days) so I don't know how it all works, but I guess what I'm asking is: why would my dad have that opinion of AA? Is there a culture of ""replacing one addiction with another""?

My mental faculties are destroyed and I have slurred speech. I have misused the freedom I got. Now I am 191 days weed free, and 146 days cigarette free. I don't know when I drank last time, but it was beer and whiskey combined with cigarettes and weed, and I ate chicken with it and puked like very nastily.

Hello,

 My story isn't related to me but to my 24 years old brother who recently mentioned that he is addicted to crackcoke.

 So last Sunday out of blue he called me and asked if he could visit us as he is in town. I said fine so he stayed the night at ours. I do not drink but he did quite a few and after a number of pints I saw that he had something to say. Eventually he started to say that he can no longer lie to me and said the he is on crack and having it once or twice a week in the last year and a half. He is gone long and detailed in the story and also mentioned that he tried a number of drugs. Also a job that he said he left he was actually dismissed as the management suspected that he was using crack, although he mentioned this to his colleagues so kind of obvious.
He is saying that he haven't used anything in the last 8 weeks and said he wants to quit. Sadly as he lives with another 3 drug addicts and most of them are also alcoholics too it isn't a friendly and supporting environment for him.

 He asked me not to mention his addition to the family as he is ashamed of it but now he also left me with a huge weight on my shoulder with this secret. Today I have messaged him about the topic but he said that everything is under control but I'm not entirely sure about that.

 I have contacted a few rehabs as I had no idea what to do and they called me back, but the overall message was to get him on and expensive rehab course. They also mentioned the NHS free rehab services but they done their sales pitch to keep me on track.

If any of you could advise me what I can do or how I could help him without churning out 5K would be appreciated!

Many thanks.

hi! i’m 17 and my brother is 15. he’s a really good kid and i love him a lot, we’re pretty close and he tells me a lot of stuff that my parents don’t know. he’s really into weed right now and i worry about him a lot, as he is adopted and his birth mom was addicted / heavily dependant on marijuana. 

anyway, my parents are extremely loving but i’m not sure if they are fully aware of how bad it is. they know he’s got a problem and they talk to him a lot and have him in therapy, but i’m not sure it’s enough. i’ve tried to tell them how worried i am, and they do their best to control my brother but i know he disobeys everything they do and sneaks out of the house, smokes in his room, drinks alone in his room, etc etc. in addition to that, when i tell them my concerns they said i need to “stop telling them how to parent”,  when in reality i’m just seeing firsthand that nothing thus far has worked to control my brother.

so; he has a therapist (meets with her over facetime currently) and i’m thinking about reaching out to her, without telling my parents. 

so i’m wondering: is this a bad idea?? and will confidentiality cover me, so that his therapist doesn’t tell my mom or him that i reached out to her? 

i just want to tell her that i’ve seen firsthand that he’s really struggling, and he’s a lot more open with me than he is with my parents, so i’m not sure they know the full extent to which his problem is at. 

so what do i do???

Think my next move is going to be admitting myself to a mental health clinic because sometimes I feel like everything's getting on top and I can't stop getting wasted,maybe if I went to a place like that away from all temptation for a while it might just sort me out . 

It's not like I've got nothing either,Just feel pure trapped in this circle of having no money,being in debt, misery and substance abuse.
I've got a half decent job,girlfriend and a pet dog but I still can't just be happy without being drunk,stoned or off my face on something or other.
Trying to stop smoking cigs at the minute but still smoking a few spliffs at night.  I'm using a vape instead instead of cigs but I've just got a pure short fuse and I'm getting pissed off at everything and driving myself mentol.",1

I'm 4yrs clean from opioids, and I'm a nurse. I'm work in a large city, but in an inner city clinic. I don't want to get into what everyone believes about this virus, but I've lost a lot of people. Patients who were friends, friends who were like family, etc. 

But shit I feel like I did when I got busted at my old job for taking meds.  Works good, I'm happier with my wife then ever, my kids are healthy. 

 So why do I feel like I'm caught between wanting to breakdown and having to keep busy to keep whatever I'm feeling at bay. I'm working a lot of 10to12hr days because of necessity, but I think at this point it's the only thing keeping me going. 

And I'm sorry. I'm not trying to shitpost. I just have no one in my situation to talk to and I wont go back to drugs.  So I know this is probably normal. I know there's not much I can do. But thanks everyone. Writing this out during break helped.",5

My bank balance is -800 probably (I used PayPal) and my credit card is a couple dollars over the 3000 limit.

I took some of them orally, snorted some of them, All while abusing nicotine, a lil bit of leftover thc and coffee. 

Currently: I am hearing faint notices that don’t exist, I have spent the past night making solution of Adderall. I have a midterm at 1, which I got a 2 day extension on but I don’t know a single thing and am going to likely fail. 

I have ruined my life over the past couple of years, sometimes I was sober and sometimes it was nicotine/marijuana or other drugs but in general I barely have any friends cause I prioritize drugs, my parents are depressed because of me, my sister hates me, I have a 2.0 something gpa and no post college options.

It took all of this to finally self accept the depths of my addiction. I made an appointment request with an addiction psychiatrist group for Thursday. I’m going to tell my parents tomorrow. 

As I’m typing this I don’t event feel sad, I just feel optimistic that this time will be the time everything changes. In reality I usually spend the last night of my binges being delusional about changing my life. But this time I made an appointment and will confesses so who knows.",72

Growing up as a teenager I had a really bad pornography addiction. I used to watch it 7 days a week and it really took an impact on my social life and it really made me lose my confidence. It made my dating life and sex life horrible. I knew I was better than that, I could not believe this was taking over my life and how could I  let it get this far. So one day I was like fuck this I need to get my life together. I started to set goals and strategies by locking all porn websites and started bettering my life by going to the gym and finding new hobbies. I tried playing basketball and started doing cycling classes. It was amazing I met some great friends. I started eating healthier. I did everything I could to take my mind off it. I started to find passions and hobbies and became a personal trainer. I EVEN started dating again due to all the sex dysfunctions from watching all the pornography. It was a very tough process but I was able to power through this shit and get my life somewhat together after 6 1/2 months. So the moral of the story is do not let these addictions control you. What controls your mind controls your life! Mental toughness!

2020-05-19 20:55:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gn1e8b/the_bad_days/,The Bad Days,"There are millions of people in the world struggling with the mental illness of addiction. Some of us are having good days and some are having bad days. When we are newly sober, at first the bad will always seem to overshadow any good that we have in our lives. As time goes on we will make some friends in sobriety, work some program, and we may even see a glimmer of hope in our future. For those that see that spark I urge you to grab and hold onto it for dear life. That spark is your potential, your hopes, your dreams, and everything good about your future. If you nurse that spark and care for it one day in the distant future it will shine brightly through any darkness.

But in beginning of our sobriety we need to understand that all we have ever known is darkness and bad days. All of our actions, choices, decisions, and beliefs that were apart of your addiction will only result in more darkness if you keep them active in your life. Your only hope is to use that teeny tiny glimmer of hope and use it as a guide to transform the rest of your life. Learn habits and actions that make that spark grow brighter and to cast out every aspect of the way you used to live.

There will always be bad days when the weight of the world feels likes its going to crush you. But there is a limit to the amount of suffering one can experience and your brain learns to desensitize you to it so you can resume life again. Know that as long as you stay sober and commit to leading a better life, that pain will always be temporary. But if you use it as an excuse to give into your addiction all you will know is pain, neverending emptiness, and loneliness. When we relapse we let that that spark of hope go out and everytime we lose it, we may never get the chance to find it again.

One day I hope you are happy that you were born an addict. Not just for the chance to better help others, but for the opportunity to truly understand misery and hopelessness only to overcome it. When you have plumbed the depths of the despair I cannot tell you how much more you can appreciate simple pleasures such as a walk through the park or having a loved one nearby. Then the bad days will only serve as another reminder of how far you have come and how good you have it now.

There are truly only a few things in this world that matter and having overcome addiction I can see them so much more clearly than the rest of the world. The people whose stories begin shrouded by darkness, shine so much brighter when they overcome all the odds that were stacked against them. So, be that person that overcomes the odds and make your life worth living! I will wait here for you with my hand stretched outward, hoping that my spark can shine brightly enough to show you the way.",4

Quality of Life issue,"I've been addicted to tramadol pills and benzos for 10 years. I got completely dependent on tramadol especially. Tried to quit many times. Tried kratom. Tried tapering. Tried cold turkey. 

 I'm trying to quit tramadol again. Severe depression, no energy , can't function, can't get off couch.  It's day 3 only after a long taper ftom 1000mg to 25mg just FYI. 

But it's just so hard. I've been clinically depressed since 13. Upon discovering tramadol 10  years ago my depression went away and I had energy like never before. Achieved great success in life. Had energy to date, get married, start business, invest in Rea estate. Can retire at 49 all of which I believe I couldn't do without the pick me up from the tramadol. Of course I kept upping my dosage to the point of unsustainability.

The withdrawal is just too much and for what? So I can return to my depressed self before I started them. They saved me in a way. Probably would have committed suicide without them 10 years ago. I'm married but can't give the love my wife deserves. She's a good woman and deserves better. 

I'm 49. I'm thinking that it may be better to reinstate. Not to get high but just to not be sick.
Stay on for another 10 years thrn if I end my life at least my quality of life would be better on tramadol than without.

Isn't there a scenario where it's better to stay on the drug for a better quality of life or is my mind playing tricks?

**No regrets**

When it was the last time you went wrong

Believing, you were right?

When did you with the best intensions

Blinded, lied and cheat?

Repay all debt and interest

For every taken step.

No regrets.

At the crossroads of dreams,

No lamentations,

At the crossroads of dreams.

When was the last time you gritted your teeth,

Instead of screaming?

When you raised your hands too quickly

And surrendered in advance?

Spit on the devils, extinguish the bush,

Get off the ground.

No regrets.

At the crossroads of dreams,

No lamentations,

At the crossroads of dreams.

But sometimes, you can admit,

You pull yourself inward,

You let the moss outgrow your eyes,

And for a moment you just die.

When you don’t know what to do next,

And you don’t believe in new times,

Held on and take care of yourself…

No regrets.

At the crossroads of dreams,

No lamentations,

At the crossroads of dreams.

Recovery, to me, isn't about forcing these things from your mind. It's not about suppressing or pretending something doesn't exist. It's not about getting back to where you were before, who you were before. That's (sadly) impossible.

Recovery is about accepting the unfairness that you are struggling with something that some people will never experience. It's about exploring your mind, figuring out your patterns of thought and understanding your own emotions. It's about studying the techniques that work for you, and practicing those skills on a regular basis. It's about building up your confidence, and growing in ways you never thought possible. It's about picking yourself up, dusting yourself off, and trying again.

It's about learning how to live again.",73

Earlier today 6 arrived in the mail and after finishing all 6 some white substance came up out of my throat like a large chunk, about an inch in size. My throat feels clogged. No matter how hard a cough or drink fluids the feeling won’t go away

It feels like my throat has shrunk in size. Anytime I blow my nose the same white substance comes out.

I can’t stop. No matter how hard I try. Something just as bad as my throat is the feeling in my head. It feels like someone is squeezing my brain. Like my head is in a vice and someone is slowly tightening it. 

My whole top gum has gone completely numb as well.

Nice to meet you
So glad we met
Let me introduce myself
You probably know my
Friend Regret
My name is Addiction &
I'm coming for you
I'll take everything away
You wanted to pursue
I will come on so innocent
You'll think I am a choice
But once I grab you 
By the Horns
You'll Lose your entire voice
I will take you places
You never thought you'd go
I sneak in so slyly I think
You'll never know
I do not help anyone
I hate everyone its true
You'd be amazed by the things
I can make you do
Once I get inside you
I'll never let you go
I am a terrible disease
Slowly I will grow 
I will take away your dreams
Your passion will be no more
Only me will be the love you seek
You will search for & adore
You'll need me to comfort you
 I'll tell you everything is alright
But Just when you start to
Believe my lies
I'll take away your sight
I'll give you rose colored glasses
To wear every night & day
At least we can pretend 
It will take all your pain away
My sister is withdrawel
& she loves to hold you tight
She will make you feel sick so
You'll never sleep at night 
I so love to see you cry 
Make you feel helpless 
dumb & weak
I will rip your body to shreds
Till you can no longer speak
I will take away everything you
Use to hold so dear
Your job your money your family
Instead you'll live your life in
Anxiety  full of  fear
Feelin like your already dead
When I add another twist
Meet my other brother 
His name is dread
His favorite is to watch you 
As you Slit your wrist
I want to watch you fall to pieces
& make yourself look a fool
When you lost all your friends
So you take too much of me
& sit alone and drool
When I'm finally done with you
& Your of value to me no more
I laugh as you take your own life
Then kick you dead on the floor
Yes my name is Addiction

In the past two weeks we have used about 10g between us. every night we take it we say “this is the last now for a few weeks” and then the next night one of us mentions it and we get in another g or 2. It’s so easy for us to get, we have two dealers who live locally and no matter what time we ring they will drive out to and deliver it to our door.

We decided Friday to take at least a two week break. Sunday night we decide to have a couple of drinks, two drinks in and we ring our dealer and he comes straight over with another 1.5g

We have now told our dealer we’re on a break, we don’t want it and I’m hoping we can stick to it but the two of us together, it seems like we’re not helping the other person when one of us says we would like it, the other just says ok.

So much money gone down the drain, we owe money for the next 3 weeks because we couldn’t afford to pay for it all cash when we got it.

Need to come up with something else to keep us entertained in the evenings when the cocaine cravings hit. 

Is this on the road to addiction or am I just being weak and dramatic by giving into the cravings so easy? We have also now decided not to drink alcohol for a few weeks because that makes the cravings stronger.",1

I have quit for a week here and there but I've been doing this practically every night for far too long. I'd say it's imprinted deep in my psyche.

My story began when I started to work overnight. I can’t really talk about what I do. 
But it’s normal for me to do a ton of stuff that evolves using my brain. Ton of calculations, programming, physical meetings. (Yes, still have a ton of work during corona)
It’s normal for me to work until 3-4am, wake up at 8am go to another city, then go to the party, stay awake there until sunrise.
And it’s endless loop.
But all changed, when I found out about addy.

I first tried it 3-4 month ago. 15mg didn’t do shit for me. So I took whole 30mg. I thought I found the sweet spot for me. But my tolerance build up so fast, in first week I went up to 60mg a day. And every week it was going up. Until I released that ate 28 pills in 2 days.

This endless loop transformed in endless day. I always had a ton of energy without anything. Also I always had problems with getting sleep and concentration. But with time I get used to problems with concentration. It was under control.

So when I released that I’m fucked up. I only had 30mg left. I decided to take a physical and mental hit. (After ready about adderall withdrawal)

I canceled all meetings and decided to take a brake from my shit, to chill, relax and don’t think about anything.

I stayed up until 5-6am, woke up at 8-9am, felt like shit for like an hour. And then nothing happened. So I decided to go with my friends to birthday party in another city on the next day. Same shit, stayed up until 5-6. I thought that maybe it just didn’t wash out from my body. I took vitamin complex + vitamin C.
Next day I was driving car and talking without a stop for whole fucking road (~ 3 hours)

Party began, everybody was drinking (I don’t drink and smoke, quit this shit). But times went by and I noticed, that everybody is fucked, I’m sober, don’t want to sleep at all. It was 3-4am. 
I took a bottle of wine, sit with my friend on the backyard and in a hour or so, I consumed whole bottle. I was sitting there with my friend for like an extra hour talking about life and shit. Then I noticed that I was sober, not like super sober, but I was totally okey. And then where is hell begins. I just didn’t want to sleep, I took a joint, smoked it and felt asleep. But woke up in a few hours, cleaned everything, took my shit and left with my friend.  Because we had some things to do. 
 
It was my third day without adderall, and I ended up staying up for whole day until 6am. Everything got back to the loop. But I feel like something changed inside me. I don’t feel that I need to sleep, I didn’t feel like shit or had a depression.

What could that be? Is it possible to not have adderall withdrawal?",2

I understand, and sympathize for those who are watching someone close to them drown in their addiction. However forcing someone into sobriety is not going to work. 

I see a lot of posts on this sub from family and friends of an addict looking for answers on what they should do. The truth is until said addict decides to change for themself, there isn't much you can do for them. The moment they are left to their own devices they will relapse because it wasn't their intention to quit in the first place. I'm not saying you should allow them to drown in their problems, however attempting to ""fix"" them is futile. What is a far better approach as a friend/family member is simply letting them know you are there for them. 

Offer assistance if they ask for it, and be someone they can confide in. Many times, us addicts are covering for a larger problem in our lives we are having issues facing. Simply having someone we could talk to and not feel judged can make all the difference.",69

My sister is a weed addict. While I sadly deep down don’t think she’s a good person, her addiction is also a mental disease that controls her behavior. It’s been years and she is very manipulative as well as a pathological liar. She has manipulated my poor sweet mother that she is such a victim from life that she can’t work, stays at home, watches tv all day, and smokes weed. With her money. She’s high all the time. She never has a clear mind. She doesn’t even know what to do with her time. I know the seemingly obvious answer: get a job. While I have been begging for this “parenting”, she is the laziest person i have ever met in my life. She’s the least employable too. I would never hire her. I have great work ethic. Makes me feel productive, gives me structure and independence. She dreads it. She is such a burden on our family and we have tried to help for years but she lies and steals. Then makes us feel sorry for her. I don’t know what to do. She just got my mom kicked out of her favorite apartment in the world, that she loved so much, what she called the most wonderful place she ever got to live in her whole life, for smoking weed in the apartment. They moved to a shithole yesterday. 5 hours in, shes smoking a joint in the bathroom. She just dropped out of college. Didn’t even take her finals. She is manipulating my mom and will drain her financially now that she already has emotionally. There’s a lot to this story but please if anyone has any experience in anything related I am desperate for advice. I’m looking for a therapist or counselor to see if i can counsel them together (they are codependent now too) to really approach this as you would approach an addict. But she’s a liar and says what they want to hear. I’m so nervous and scared. How do you tough love an addict, a lazy depressed manipulative obese lying self-loathing addict? I know my mom is acting out of fear afraid for what she will do and where she will end up, and I hate that she blames herself for how she turned out.

I was recently forced to quit weed due to my living arrangement plus needing to find a new job and my job field drug tests when hired. My quit date was mid April but I’ve slipped a few times since, and last time I smoked weed was May 8. 

I’ll be visiting my boyfriend of 8 months tomorrow for one week (it’s been 2 months since we’ve seen each other bc covid) and he smokes pot heavily and daily. I was very supportive of him quitting cigarettes recently but he hasn’t been supportive at all of me quitting weed. It’s been the cause of a couple arguments already and I’m worried this week it will be the cause of more. Or worse, that I may give in and smoke when I really know my job timeline can’t afford it. (The last thing I want it to lose a job over one high, plus I’m trying to self improve as weed fuels my depression). Tonight on the phone he told me he got a new weed pen so that I won’t be able to tell when he’s vaping weed vs vaping nicotine. I think he was maybe trying to be helpful/considerate, but it felt more like a slap in the face when I’ve already asked him not to talk about weed to me at all over the phone. I took offense over the weed pen remark, bc if felt like he was saying he’ll be pulling one over on me all week. Personally I’d rather know when he’s smoking weed, Altho I imagine I’ll be able to tell in person regardless.

I really don’t know what to expect out of this post or for this coming week as my relationship has been on the rocks for a bit now. I feel like I’m being uptight since “it’s just weed” but it’s the fact that I can’t have any and it feels like he’s rubbing his weed in my face all incognito like. I just needed to vent and ask for words of encouragement on holding out this week, as temptation will be ever abundant. I do plan on consuming copious amounts of alcohol to compensate. 

TLDR: annoyed that my bf will be smoking weed in front of me this week when I’m trying to reframe from it. Can’t afford to indulge, words of encouragement appreciated",2

It’s the only resource I feel like I chase after because it’s the only method that lets me do what I loved and had a passion for before I became a tweaker which is to act/dance/sing. Sometimes I’ll pretend I’m in a scene of a movie or in a music video with Adele playing in the background. I know it sounds stupid but my soul thirsts for performance.

This is not the life I want. I gave myself permission to act poorly. I had survived pretty much the entire lockdown without wanting whippits but somehow when everything started opening again, my anxiety shot through the roof. It’s like I wasn’t ready for the real world quite yet and it was forcing its way back to normal, so I went to my old escape route.

Coming up on 24 hours clean. I need a game plan. I’m going to be posting on this sub again (it did me wonders the first few weeks). Going to start taking B12 injections regularly again (they shutdown the clinic due to covid but I think they are available online). I’m going to eat healthy and exercise but I’m NOT going to overdo it trying to fix everything in my life all at once. I want 90 days clean of this before committing to too many other changes.

And I'm an emotionally weak coward.","PLEASE READ THOROUGHLY (LONG POST AHEAD):

I have substance-induced schizophrenia, behaviour  and anger issues. I have very poor mental health.

I have lost my creativity, mental faculties, capabilities due to weed, alcohol, cigarettes and masturbation. I started smoking cigarettes occasionally on 14 and 16, then became a chain smoker during 18 to 22.5 (on and off). Smoked weed during 19 to 22.5 (was on and off, again, but sometimes I would abuse it to the point of overdose). And about alcohol, I've abused it as well in between (I don't drink much because of it's taste). But when I drink, I drink like a monster. 

Wasted a lot of money on college, addictions, and coaching classes that I eventually bunked due to addictions. I've overdosed on these three substances (whenever I'd have a joint, bong or a cigarette, I'd take deep, long drags, which results in overdose). I hate myself and I'm a burden to my family. No one in my family has a history of substance abuse. 

Wasted so much of my father's hard-earned money in these substances. Sold a gold ring my father bought to me when I was 15, and a cycle that I bought in college to support my addictions. Also, stole money from a good friend of mine to buy weed and cigarettes (I guess some debt from some other friends still needs to be paid). Last year couldn't pay my rent for 2 months at a place I stayed to do an internship. I overdosed on alcohol once there and was smoking weed to the point that I built tolerance. Lord's not gonna forgive me or may punish me soon for my deeds. Also, I couldn't excel in my college placements because I didn't study for that. 

I've smoked in public places as well. Which is harming to others. I'm a fucking moron.

Without the substances I'm very agitated and irritated on simple life challenges. Didn't sleep well in my college days and I never gave any exam on time which resulted in less grades and lack of ambition. It's all my fault. No one told me to do these substances, I did it to mostly fit in. 

Just to break the rules of society as a part of rebellion. Being a narcissistic, I have lost my purpose, kindness, and sanity. All I have is list, anger, anxiety, hatred and jealously in my heart. I know nobody likes these things but I gotta tell my truth here, whether anybody likes it or not.

I can't return the love that my parents gave me because I don't earn anything. Can't work hard you know. I have become this narrow minded person. I wish someone put a bullet in my head or I must get the coronavirus. I just don't want to live now. My intelligence has turned against me. 

My lies have pulled down my life. I mostly don't remember so many facts and dates when I started and ended, and most of my facts here are scattered. I have written them to the extent that I remember.

I am mostly silent, and as they say, silent people are the most dangerous ones. That's frankly true in my case.

Please help. Any ways to treat memory loss, integrity and ignorance?",9

I will start from the beginning. 

My husband and I have been together for 18 years and have two amazing children together. I love my husband but I feel like he doesn't care about his family and the damage that he keeps causing.

I was diagnosed with a primary immune deficiency 3 years ago and have to get IVIG therapy to increase my igg level to fight off common colds and illnesses once a month for the rest of my life. My infusions are hard on my body and take 6 hours to infuse.


For the past 2 years my husband has been abusing his perception drugs oxycodone 10 mg 3 ×daily, clonazepan 1mg 3×daily, Adderall 15 mg 3x daily.  His prescriptions would last him a week sometimes 10 days.

Shortly after being prescribed these medications my husband becsme extremely abusive, started hitting me, throwing things at me, destroying my property and would physically hurt me to take my purse and steal my sons Adderall and my pain meds something he never did before he started abusing his medication. I have a serious health condition and I need certain meds before every infusion or my brain could swell and cause complications so I need my medicine or I could end up with in the hospital with aseptic meningitis. Believe me its not fun. Especially when I don't have anyone I can truly rely on to take care of our kids. 

It has been hell for thre past 2 years. It has been hard dealing with it myself with absolutely no money because it would mysteriously disappear or I did something with it when I didn't have access to it. 

Its very exhausting having to deal with my illness take care of out 2 kids while having a drug addict for a husband who doesn't support me or take care of our kids. He leaves us stranded for days if not weeks.

All of our family lives out of state and it was hard to get his family to see how bad it had gotten until he kept running out of gas from spacing out while driving for hours and not realizing he needed to get gas, asking family members to barrow money that he never planned to pay back.

 He totaled our car in February 2019 after going on a week long bender and completely abandoning us with no transportation or money for rent because he used it for gas to go get drug 4 hours away. He was the only one involved in the accident so he didn't get drug tested. When he's high he drifts off the side of the road and doesn't seem to notice what he's doing and most likely lost control. 

The rest of the year was so hard. It was a roller-coaster. He would abuse, withdrawal and then get a refill and abuse, withdrawal things would start getting better and then he would get another refill. I started finding straws cut in half and a razor blade. I called them snorting kits. Idk I have never done anything like that so that's what I called them. I would find them on the floor where our kids could easily find them. 


In December 2019

I just got back from dropping the kids off at school  and when I got home my was having withdrawals and became hostel, violent because he was out of his prescriptions and wanted our sons Adderall and my pain medication. I told him no. You have a problem and its time you admitted it.

 One minute he's laying in bed and the next thing I new he was on top of me. Choking me, punching me, he pinned me down on the ground and put his knee on my chest while he choked me. I couldn't breathe and my vision was getting fuzzy. I couldn't hold on to my purse anymore so I let go. He let go of my throat so he could open my purse and take my our medications. I was able to twist to the side and reached for my cell phone and I called the police and started screaming as loud as I could. I thought he was going to kill me. 

2 day later he was arrested for robbery, domestic violence charges and kid napping.

When he was in jail I was extremely scared. I called his doctor and left a message, sent in the police report and told my husband's doctor he was abusing his prescription medication. He was nodding of neglecting the kids, crashed our car, I told his doctor everything becausei was scaredandthoughtitwouldstop there. His doctor refused to refill his prescriptions after his drug abuse was verified. 

I was beat up pretty bad. I pressed charges against him. His dad hired a lawyer and he ended up getting a deal. 3 years probation, no harassment order so he can't physically hurt me or harass me or he will go back to jail. 

He was in jail for 2 weeks. His dad talked me into trying to get my husband into rehab for less jail time. He said he would help me and help with bills while John was away. 

I was scared but I said okay but if John abuses drugs again I'm done. 

5 months have gone by. Everything was going great.
We didn't fight, he was kind and caring, he helped with the kids  and around the house. Things where getting back to normal.

He ended up not going to rehab, his dad didn't help with anything and I got stuck dealing with him instead of taking care of myself and giving myself time to heal. Him and his dad used me until he was out of jail and then what happened to me didn't matter and the support vanished. 

what I thought was good was not the case at all. I had my last ivig infusion May 12th. When I got in the car after my infusion he seemed off. He was mumbling and wasn't his normal self. Some how his pack of cigarettes slid on to my lap off the dashboard and popped open and out fell a cut up straw with white powder. 

I couldn't believe while I was getting my monthly infusion my husband bought some oxycodone and snorted it. He admitted to it and said I was overreacting and its like taking a pill. 

I recorded him confessing what he did without shame. I'm so angry and disgusted. 

 He dropped me off at home and didn't come home for 3 days. Ignored all responsibilities.

He completely changed within hours. 

He found a new doctor and had his first appointment the day after my infusion. His doctor hasn't received his medical records yet so he doesn't know he's an abuser. My husband brought in an old prescription bottle for clonazepan. I'm positive his new doctor prescribed it again. He keeps nodding off, his eyes are glazed over and he argues about everything, very forgetful and self centered and doesn't care about the kids needs whatsoever. He's starting to be abusive again. I want out but have nowhere to go. 

He is spending money and dragging us all down with him. This needs to stop asap. 

Can I notify his probation officer. I'm so scared. I shouldn't have helped him get out of jail last time. 

I can't deal with this anymore. I just want him to stop. 
I will notify his new doctor. I have 100 of pictures that I have taken of his abuse. I just want him to leave me alone so I can raise our kids in peace without being stranded because he takes the car and pretty much abandons us.",10

At the start of this year i really tried to cut it out and it was going okay for a while, but over the last few weeks having been furloughed from work, I have fallen back into old habits. 

All my closest friends use cocaine and when they get on it I find it impossible to not do the same. We have been doing zoom/webcam socials since the quarantine began and even though I'm not physically with them I feel triggered by their use and end up picking up myself. 

I imagine people will suggest I cut things off with these friends, but they are my closest and oldest friends and I just dont see that happening. 

I'm so fed up of doing this to myself and self sabotaging. I want to be healthy and look after my mind.

I've also been drinking pretty much every night since the quarantine began. I see this as less of a problem but past a certain point drinking for me often leads to coke.

I live with my girlfriend who is supportive and has suggested I look for help online. 

I dont really know what I'm looking for posting this but I just feel so helpless and need to vent. Thank you.",2

Now that I'm 44, it's turned into something I regret instead","I got fired from my job a couple weeks before the covid pandemic hit the US (where I live).

My unemployment claim was denied and I lost all appeals because I couldn't prove my previous employer wasn't being honest so I wiped out my savings and retirement accounts in less than 2 months.

I have felonies from 25 years ago but they get in the way of some employment opportunities for me.

I got myself a DUI about 3 years ago and that prohibits me from some jobs as well.

The pandemic hasn't helped with the job search, but I'd do damn near anything for a steady income and I haven't heard back from companies like Amazon, Walmart, Kroger, etc and they're all supposedly hiring massive amounts of people.

After about 2 months of not leaving the house so I wouldn't waste money, someone told me that Postmates accepts people with DUI's (unlike the other gig driving apps in my area). I signed up immediately and I am giddy to bring any money in even if there are 12+ hour days that only net me less than 90 bucks. I spend a lot to keep my car going so I can use it to make money to spend on it so I know I'm breaking even and not much more than that.

But here I am as a 44 year old man who spent his late teens and early twenties on the streets and in prison and became an amazing father who raised a couple of incredible young adults and now hates how cocaine makes him feel but spends 75% of what little he makes to get a baggie every single day.

I've been to the ER almost 10 times in the last couple of years because I've had chest pains and they were all nothing more than snorting coke and feeling a heart attack that didn't exist and I damn sure didn't want. The intravenous Ativan was absolutely lovely every time though haha 

I'm high as shit right now and I fucking hate how I feel just like I always do. Yet tomorrow I'll laugh to myself when I know I can get enough money together to get more. And I will. And I won't even enjoy it yet again.

I have a problem. I want help. But I don't want to get help and I don't know why or how to get there. I'm sorry anybody that feels like me knows how alone they feel while knowing millions of others feel alone too.

Fuck addiction. And for the love of god I hope I don't feel the same when I'm 55!!

I'll end this anti cocaine, cocaine fueled rant now and if anybody reads it til the end, thank you, and I'm really sorry lol.

I’ve smoked meth 2 or 3 times over the past few years with no real “feeling” of impact.  Same thing with Cocaine.  I was well into my 40’s before I did any drug.  I have prescription for adderall and can dial down my dose pretty easy.  Over the last 2 weeks, however, I’ve smoked meth 1-3 X a day, 4-5 days a week.  I use a glass pipe and get 2-3 good pulls each time.  I was definitely feeling something and stopped taking the adderall.  Really had no issues on the days I didn’t smoke the meth.  One day, I did more than usual, and the following two days I was fatigued, severely depressed and so unmotivated it scared the hell out of me.  I see stories of long time users quitting and the withdrawal process , and some people that claim to be recreational users that manage, but I just want to stop completely.  It scares me that I haven’t seen a similar question like mine asked / answered on here because I feel the bad news is I may already be on the on-ramp to a road of long time detrimental use if I don’t stop.  Now.  Does anyone have advice / experiences or perspective on what to expect in a situation such as mine.

- i am dumb and didn’t get my pills tested. bought two, took one. trusted my dealer bc he had good coke (lol literally no connection) 
- i took one tiny pill. a bit more research and i would’ve learned to only take half, wait two hours, and decide if i wanted to redose. never just do a whole one if unsure of dose/purity 
- i was alone, just intending to dance and vibe out. i love getting high alone and i was tryna have fun. i had never had a negative drug experience until this point, so i got cocky 
- i didn’t do it to cope w anything. i actually recently found my peace and am surrounded by love in my life. i literally just popped the pill on a whim because i wanted to have FUN 
- also, PLEASE JUST DON’T POP PILLS JFC THEY WILL KILL YOU. UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY GET THEM TESTED DON’T DO IT. 
- didn’t research ecstasy as much as i usually research drugs before doing them. bad move. research could’ve prevented this. one more trip to errowid and i might have been spared lol 

SUMMARY OF EXPERIENCE: 

- after popping pill, took only 25 MINUTES for terrifying side effects to kick in. came on suddenly and intensely, all at once. 

-  SIDE EFFECTS included immobility, nausea, clenching jaw, rapid eye movement/twitching/lazy eye, slurred speech, cold sweats, rapid heartbeat, profusely sweating, feverish, body trembling, and CRAZY acid-like visuals. but not the nice, curvaceous, beautiful kind of acid visuals. the terrible, jagged, gritty, pointy, scary, trip gone wrong type of visuals. 

- i recorded a bunch of crazy, rambling, slurred videos of myself basically oding, going on about how i loved everyone in my life, this was my dumb mistake, i am dying in peace, no one is to blame, cremate me, don’t do drugs, etc. made like 2 hours worth of videos. confessed where i was hiding all my drugs, money, etc. revealed everything and came to peace because i was CONVINCED i would die 

- I COULD FEEL MYSELF DYING. i did not call 911 because i accepted that this was totally self inflicted, and by calling for help i would be holding my parents indirectly accountable. they would then feel direct influence on my death w things like “why didn’t we get her help sooner” bla bla bla. didn’t want anyone else to be responsible but myself (i understand why some will think this is stupid, i know i’m stupid lmao) 

- i actually got to the point, 5 hours of suffering, where i was looking at my bed. totally dehydrated, completely broken, ready to just lay down and let death take me. i know that if i had gone to bed feeling the way i was feeling, i would’ve died. i just knew it. it’s like this crazy force was telling me that i would be getting into my death bed. 

- so i fought it by not going to bed. that’s it. i fought through it, stayed up till 6 am till my dad woke up, he shared his bagel with me, and we went and spent the day together. i was coming down and i’ve still had incredibly mild visuals all day. very very mild now. like everything is sort of alive, but not morphing. i think now a decent nights sleep will be good. 

- don’t be like me. it sucked to know that i had JUST experienced true love, peace, and forgiveness in my life only to have it plucked away by a dumb pill. who knows what that pill was. i think it was PMA. idk. it doesn’t matter. the crazy thing is, i was ready to die at peace. i wasn’t scared of the afterlife or the unknown that came with it, and i knew that it would be justified for me to live or die. 

- i simply chose to survive. and i learned what it truly means to be alive- it is the active decision to get up and choose to survive each and every day. one day at a time, for whatever reason. and i am so grateful and i will never put my life on the line like that ever again. while i’m not scared of death, i realized i have way too many reasons to keep living than to just lay in my death bed and give up.

So a while ago I developed tinnitus from using ketamine excessively, god knows how ketamine gave me tinnitus (please let me know if any of you have a had the same).

 It was unbearable, and I then discovered that xanax made it go away, made it quiet and unnoticeable. However xanax fucks you up big time and I would forget days and even weeks of my life. So I started using Valium and it had a similar effect, and also gave me incredible social confidence and clarity of thought.

I have now become tolerant to it though and just today I must have taken around 100mg and I'm getting strange tingles in my head and in my legs. I feel like I need to use diazepam to be normal, to be socially confident. I worry what will happen when I stop taking it.

Not sure how to best go about this, I've never attended any meetings or recovery in my life. I made a lame attempt to sort of get help from a therapist, and I've shared my story with only one other person, a healer but it didn't go anywhere.

Looking forward to learning how to finally beat a loooongtime cocaine addiction. Im in my early 50's and highly functioning and stealthy about my habit. I've done very well in my career, have a beautiful family and have everything anyone could want. And one major thing nobody wants. My wife has no clue, my kids do have a clue (which causes me a huge amount of shame), most friends and colleagues don't really know the extent of it.

This addiction damages my health, work, family life, friendships, everything. And feeling really good naturally only takes 3 or 4 days of not using and I can barely do it. My addiction today is as fierce as it's ever been. Quarantine has actually made it easier to use, I have an office to myself every day. It's getting out of hand. 

The primary inhibitor to my sobriety is shame. I just can't bring myself to tell anyone about it (you're  the lucky few). I'm just not ready for that kind of vulnerability, not sure I'll ever be. I can't ever tell my wife or good friends. It's too much. I know many recovery systems include lots of confession and amends etc but that's not me. I'm really hopeful some system or something can help me overcome this on my own or at least with people who I don't already know. 

Thanks for listening. Hopeful.

I noticed by the 7th or so month i was feeling myself again but just felt a 'numbness' towards everything. I just brushed it off as a temporary side effect and used it to my advantage. In the rest ot the time of being sober i had achieved everything i set out to accomplish. I had 2 jobs, 65k worth of savings, stable relationship those around me, hobbies and dealt with every single issue i had neglected to deal with. I left no stone unturned thanks to this 'emotional invulnerability"". My addiction changed my entire identity...i became 'whole with the universe'.  But still this numbness remained...i didn't care about it until my partner of 6 years cheated on me and left me. That was in December. It hasnt phased me. I've processed it, understood it and learnt from it but i feel nothing towards her or what happened when i know i should have.
I ended up relapsing through reconnecting with bad associations. Heres the funny part. I dont even feel anything towards drugs. Ive had Ice one day and smashed my pipe the next without any hesitations or withdraws mentally or physically. 
Id also like to mention. Im still functioning like a normal human would. Im not diagnosed with anything and im not avoiding anything....

2020-05-15 15:10:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gkff16/i_feel_lost/,I feel lost,"Addiction has always been a part of my life in some way or another since I was a kid.

My dad is a gambling addict. It has been under control for over ten years, but this addiction nearly tore our family apart in my late teens. I remember my parents arguing all the time and to be honest, that was the norm in our family;  i just accepted it as the hand our family got dealt in the game of life. Anyway, I woke up one morning in my senior year to my brother screaming in shock and the smell of carbon monoxide coming from the garage. The stress and helplessness had a toll on mum over the years and she tried to end her life.

I was 18 at the time and only then realised how serious our family problems were. At the time I just remember being angry. Angry at dad for his problems. Angry at mum for trying to kill herself. Angry at the word ""family"". Angry at myself at how pathetically incapable I was. Just angry at life in general. At the time, leaving felt like my best path, so that's what I did.

This really messed me up. I was in a new city alone and I felt like I could fuck up my life in every way possible, and it would still be better than the heavy shit going on in my family. I hated going back to see my family; it felt like their way of dealing with it was to just pretend it never happened and it made me want to throw up.

At the time I thought I was being 'strong' and 'independent' but looking back I can see how vulnerable I was. I could no longer make healthy bonds and relationships with my family and I was desperately trying to fill the void with something else. That something could have just as easily been substance; I was playing a really dangerous game with my life. But instead, I found music. And through music, God found me (I hate using the word 'God' because im not talking about anything religious, but there is no better word). I didn't deserve it. It's just the way it happened. I got lucky.

But this isn't about me. Because many people I love in my life weren't so lucky. It's not like I was educated about addiction any more than they were, and judging by the amount of self respect I had for myself at the time, I feel like I should be the one to have end up addicted to something terrible. They don't deserve to be addicted to meth, alcohol or gambling, just like I never deserved to be addicted to music and find God.

I feel like my particular relationship with addiction sort of made me more aware of the addicts around me. For some of them it has gotten so bad that their friends and even family have cut ties with them one by one and I don't even  blame them given the circumstances. But I just can't seem to do that myself. To be honest it's not even because I'm trying to be a good friend and I want to do something nice for them.. I'm really just doing it for myself. Because I know how this journey ends, and I don't want to be thinking to myself ""I could have done something"". I don't need that shit in my life. I just want to be able to say to myself, ""I did everything I could"" at the end when it all goes to shit.

But this is really hard. I'm struggling so much. I'm not a clinical psychologist and as this shit just gets heavier and heavier. I realise addiction is just much bigger than I will ever be. I don't know what to do. I can't bring myself to say to myself ""you can't help them if they don't want to be helped"" like everyone else and just forget about them. I wish I could. It has gotten to the point that I can barely find the person I used to know and it really hurts to think that person no longer exists. I'm even starting to feel like the ones in prison are the lucky ones, although I never used to see it that way.

I thought there was going to be some message or at least a conclusion out of this rant, but there really isn't one that's going to be much help. I don't really expect anyone on reddit to provide any solutions. I really just wanted to talk about this and I just want to share this with someone else in the world about how helpless and alone I feel right now.",2

The similarities between post-traumatic stress and substance use disorders might seem obvious if you look at the brain structures involved, but cold, objective science doesn't always match personal, subjective experience. One might speculate that the feelings of being on the front line of the Vietnam war, being the only survivor when your whole platoon is killed in a guerrilla attack, and then the feelings you have during your subsequent revenge-pillaging of a nearby village the next day might seem different than being a street-hardened survivor of heroin addiction in a ghetto- until you talk to any survivor of the war on drugs in the warzones of west Baltimore.

&#x200B;

The police's knockers and jump out boys are similar to guerrilla ambushes that make you feel like your own platoon (or gang) is under constant threat of annihilation. These threats of annihilation are very real, as we can see in the case of the police neglect and brutality that led to the murder of Freddie Gray and the subsequent en-action of vengeance in the form of protests and riots. 

&#x200B;

Ask any police officer why they don't even bother to attempt to stop the open-air drug markets that are hittin' right this second in Southwest Baltimore and they'll tell you that it's too dangerous: this is a warzone, and if they go in there to break up one of the blocks by arresting a dope boy, they'll be surrounded by 50 people jeering at them and threatening violence. 

&#x200B;

They'll have to call for backup, and the tension and violence that hang like the omnipresent cracksmoke in the air is as unstable as the disordered, disconnected brains of those that grew up with the traumas and stresses of generations of poverty and the 17,000 abandoned buildings full of lead paint that are ready to collapse- rowhomes that were abandoned as a direct result of hyper-racist practices like redlining and block busting. 

&#x200B;

It's almost as if these communities see the police as an oppressive, occupying force in a warzone; like the police are peoples of power and authority that could take them to a privatized, for-profit, prisoner-of-war camp at any moment- oh, wait, that's because they are.

&#x200B;

Dr VDK describes working with Vietnam veterans shortly after the war and explains how they would compulsively re-live their traumas in their survivors groups. He explains watching men who were otherwise basically dead in their normal lives come back to life and become very animated and excited when they would re-enact their ""war stories"" of death and destruction in support groups for veterans.

&#x200B;

The compulsion to re-live these highly emotional memories is a component of bouncing back from SUDs as well: the times that a disordered person goes to cop in the war-ravaged ghettos and winds up with a syringe in their hands are the times that their brain makes them feel the most alive- exactly like Dr. VDK's Vietnam veterans, who felt most alive with a machine gun in their hands and emotionally dead without it. 

&#x200B;

In both the Vietnam veterans and the veterans of the war on drugs alike, there is a compulsion to remember, reenact, and re-live the chaos and unpredictability and excitement and danger that comes from being on the front lines of the war; memories that are deeply emotional, poignant, and vivid. 

&#x200B;

While powerful, emotional traumatic experiences cause what Dr. VDK calls a ""traumatic imprint"", powerful, emotional drug-induced experiences can cause what I will call an ""addictive imprint"". Thinking of a substance use disorder as a disorder of learned behavior that stems from an ""addictive imprint"" of extraordinary pleasure and relief on our memory makes more sense than anything else. 

&#x200B;

The mechanisms by which these highly emotional memories of relief/pleasure become habit are well understood. Humans are wired to repeat experiences that their brains interpret as pleasurable. The things that help us to survive must feel good, or else why would we all still be alive?

&#x200B;

The way that these pleasurable behaviors are hyper-remembered makes them especially susceptible to further subconscious convolution. The ""addictive imprint"" occurs at the moment that our brains feel the most pleasure, and the subsequent ""twisting of the arm"" occurs in subconscious structures like the basal ganglia and the dorsal striatum: structures that get us to physically move and compulsively act based on our previous memories, often without the consultation- let alone the agreement- of the rational, conscious brain. 

&#x200B;

This makes sense as well: we ""prune"" the synapses that are associated with neuropathways that don't lead to pleasure/survival, thus making our brains more efficient at automatically seeking survival. It feels good to escape an enemy; whether real or imagined. Difficulties arise when the enemies live within you, are therefore inescapable, and become semi-stronger (long winded and boring concept to explain) with each subsequent use.

&#x200B;

These ""addictive imprints"" of extreme emotional relief from the stresses of hypervigilance are unnaturally pleasurable; thus, they become ""deeply learned"" and lend themselves to the same kind of re-living, rumination, and compulsive, ritualized comfort-seeking that often occurs in PTSD. The more emotional an experience is, the better we remember it.

&#x200B;

In the case of something really extreme like being raped or killing someone, the ""traumatic imprint"" is going to lead to a different life experience than the ""addictive imprint"" that comes from the feelings of danger and excitement you have when you're a soldier on the front line in the war on drugs- along with the extreme relief that comes with drug use. However, in all instances these highly intense and incredibly emotional experiences become paramount. They become incomparable to the rest of our normal lives and will continue to affect us until we resolve these imprints by integrating them into the story of our lives and reconnecting the disconnected structures.

&#x200B;

Both the addictive and traumatic imprints have one thing in common: we become wired to stay hypervigilant in order to be able to quickly recognize cues in our environment that might indicate that we are in a similar situation- a situation that jolts us emotionally and requires us to take action quickly so that we can avoid pain and gain pleasure.

&#x200B;

As long as our eyes and ears are open and we are receiving sensory input, we can be environmentally cued by something that instantly get us to act in our brains’ ""best interest"" (pleasure) so we can ""survive"" again. Though we might understand rationally that seeking pleasure isn't always in our best survival interest and that we are very rarely actually existentially threatened, these subconscious structures in our brain cannot be reasoned with in the moment. These powerful imprints of extreme pleasure or pain continue to drive behavior long after the imprinting events.

&#x200B;

For a person who has been sexual abused, it isn't in their best survival interest to start trying to fight anyone who smells like their abuser's cologne, just as it isn't in anyone's best survival interest to use heroin the second that they see it. 

We must understand that the systems involved with our subconscious stress responses, our motivations to seek pleasure and survive, and our generation of the emotions that lead us to take action are all fucked up. These highly charged emotional mnemonic ""imprints"" are incredibly powerful. They stick with us and continue to affect us, they push us and pull us around constantly, they make us shake and tense up and salivate without our consent- and they're crucial to the understanding and treatment of these issues. 

&#x200B;

It is worthwhile to note here that taking drugs of any kind, prescription or otherwise, doesn't help to resolve or integrate these imprints.",5

I don’t intend to anger any hardcore Marvel fans. But if you’re going through something.. whatever it is. Look to Bruce Banner (the Hulk) as an example of the redemption of man. The Hulk storyline in the movies (and moreso in the comics) tells the tale of a man struggling with something deeper than himself that’s actually within himself. It’s what some psychologists call the “dark side”, Jordan Peterson has lectured about (slay the dragon), and Carl Jung names it “the shadow”.

In regards to the Hulk he is technically (and I say that loosely) one of the strongest characters in the MCH because he gets stronger the angrier he gets. So virtually there’s no limit to his strength. In the comics we’ve seen him go on rampages and destroy entire towns at ease. But he’s also used his powers to defeat the galaxy’s most troubling foes. This is all to say that it’s about how you master your force people. In the Endgame movie Bruce Banner is seen in Hulk form but yet he’s not angry. In the first Avengers film he even mentions that “he’s always angry”. This means that he is aware of the strength inside him and how he wants to use it. Regardless of the movies depiction of it, what you witness is a man that has come to terms with his “dark” side, overcome it, lives with it in harmony, AND uses it for good.

Your force can propel you to the heavens or drive you into the pits of Hell. It’s all about mastery. Learn to use your force. It’s not necessarily good or evil. The dark side is simply the unexplored inhibitions, primal forces, thoughts, and habits that maneuver you through life. It’s the manner in which you summon it. Do you summon your force to become a slave to your desires or will you use the same force to build instead of destroy ?

&#x200B;

Dr. VDK was a student and then professor of psychopharmacology and later psychiatry at Harvard. He is at the pinnacle of psychiatry, and luckily for us, Dr. VDK is very, very different than most psychiatrists. He gives a very balanced perspective on his work and his experiences: he explains how prescribing his first bottles of Zoloft in 1988 was miraculous for some of his long-term patients who were unresponsive to traditional ""talk therapy"".  

&#x200B;

Basically overnight, mental health treatment was revolutionized. Psychiatrists went from the laughingstock of the medical world- restraining and administering sedatives to people who were actually insane, having no clout in the medical field, literally and figuratively working in the basement- to being highly respected, ""real"" doctors. Dr. VDK explains here that his psychopharmacology and psychiatry classes at Harvard were suddenly packed with excited young people studying to be psychiatrists. 

&#x200B;

Pharmaceutical companies hooked them up with everything they could possibly need, and there was no shortage of graduate students for lab work. There was a good reason for all the excitement: after all, giving people pharmaceutical drugs feels like medicine, and it really does change their biology. Drugs work. There's no doubt about that, as humans have been ingesting psychoactive substances for as long as we've been alive- and back when we were monkeys, too. Drugs also provide income and profits, which psychiatry lacked before the pharmacological revolution.

&#x200B;

The problem is, most of these so-called ""mental disorders"" aren't strictly biological problems, otherwise the massive proliferation of anti-depressants and anti-psychotic medications would have caused our mental health to get better as a society- not worse, as it has been getting. Humans are primates and primates are social animals by nature, but we also have the ability to break away from the tribe and think for ourselves. 

&#x200B;

Our psychology affects our biology which affects how we act which affects our social standing, and where we stand in social dominance hierarchies like our jobs has profound effects on our biology and therefore our psychology, too. Therefore, treating post-traumatic stress, SUDs, depression, anxiety, etc. is much more complex than just giving a person a pill, despite the natural human tendency and therefore believe in the ""magic pill"" fallacy.

&#x200B;

Psychiatrists typically also practice talk therapy, but as Dr. VDK illustrates beautifully in this book, psychopharmacology/the pharmaceutical industry really owns psychiatry. Psychopharmacology is the ""drugs first"" approach, which is the approach most commonly seen in treating people dealing with addictions as well as mental health issues that extend from traumatic experiences. 

&#x200B;

If you go to a psychiatrist for treatment for your depression, it's understood and expected that you will be prescribed antidepressants, and you would probably be pissed or confused if you didn't get drugs- or least get to sit there and talk about your problems with someone who is supposed to really listen and care, with the probability of getting drugs later.

&#x200B;

It is worth interjecting here that people can easily understand how they or someone else would be chemically uncomfortable enough in their own skin to go to the doctor and claim ""depression"" to get some drugs, but take the moral high ground on the ""addict"" who was traumatized repeatedly, grew up in an unsafe, broken home and neighborhood- or, like me, with a hypervigilant stress system that led to a constant restless discomfort, chronic insomnia, and anxiety so strong that it led to nausea. An anti-depressant couldn't touch these symptoms; I felt a discomfort that was deep and powerful enough to drive me to seek relief myself, and I could not live without that chemical relief. 

&#x200B;

It’s ok as long as my drug dealer has a medical license, though, right?

&#x200B;

Let’s face it: there's nothing intrinsically morally ""wrong"" with seeking comfort by using street fentanyl, or else there's something morally ""wrong"" with seeking comfort by going to a psychiatrist for antidepressants or to the liquor store for alcohol. In any of these cases, a person is seeking a psychoactive chemical for basic bodily comfort, and they need help and support- or, alternatively, all of those people should be thrown in cages so they can find God and “get clean”.

&#x200B;

Is street fentanyl ""wrong"" because it's currently illegal? Does illegal automatically mean immoral? Slavery used to be legal, did that make it morally ""right"" to own another human being as your own property? In Saudi Arabia, women have basically no basic human rights, but that’s legal. Is that morally sound?  

&#x200B;

Every day that drugs remain illegal, we perpetuate a racist, immoral, and oppressive war on drugs, which is a far greater moral “wrong” than a person seeking basic comfort. 

&#x200B;

Do we not have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? Is basic comfort in your body not the foundation of happiness? 

&#x200B;

How would you feel if you went to the doctor for your mental health, and they called you an ""addict"" (synonymous for subhuman, criminal, unpredictable, bad person) behind closed doors and accused you of ""drug seeking""? What if they said treatment would consist of daily meetings at which you’ll have to take a ""moral inventory"" so you can learn how to “immediately admit your wrongs” and become a ""good person"" so you can finally stop doing drugs forever?

&#x200B;

Leaving the morality of drug use aside, Dr. VDK still recognized that drugs have their limits. We have to keep in mind that these doctors receive institutional training. They cut open and work on dead bodies and study brain scans and are taught lists of symptoms: they are trained to see symptoms and to treat those biological symptoms with drugs. There was an incredible amount of excitement surrounding these mental disorders and ""diseases"" back in the late 80s and 90s. 

&#x200B;

Dr VDK mentions Robert Koch and others that did incredible work in microbiology and in the treatment of infectious diseases like tuberculosis; it wasn't a bad extension of logic to think that these mental disorders would one day have something distinct that we could point to etiologically- a causational gene, for example. We were convinced we would find something that we could point to and say ""We've got it- it's right here. This is the schizophrenia (or the "" disease of addiction"", PTSD, depression, bipolar, etc.).

&#x200B;

However, despite hundreds of millions of dollars and decades of research, that never happened. On the contrary, the burgeoning and exciting fields of neuroscience and epigenetics completely turned our understanding of human life upside down: contrary to what was taught to me in middle and high school, our genetics do not determine our destiny at all, and our brains are highly malleable: they're neuro-plastic.

&#x200B;

Dr. VDK explains that they discovered that even schizophrenia, which is definitely one of the mental illnesses that seems the most tangible and ""real"", has no causational genetic link: it is the result of thousands of different gene variants that express themselves in groups- or possibly highly individual genetic mutations that would be next to impossible to target specifically with a pharmaceutical drug. The hard sciences are proving more and more that the human organism is no simple biological machine that is predetermined by genetics. 

&#x200B;

The way we think of diseases and our immune system is even changing, and there's a science for that: psychoneuroimmunology, the study of the effects our minds have on our health. Our thoughts change our very immune systems, physiological processes, and even the way that our genes ""express"" themselves. 

&#x200B;

Dr. VDK even mentions a fascinating finding he was involved in: the correlation between surviving incest and developing an autoimmune disorder, which is a disorder in which a person’s immune system attacks their own body. 

&#x200B;

It seems that the mental self-loathing and hatred towards a person’s own body/lives from surviving incest is so powerful that their own immune system will mobilize against itself. 

&#x200B;

Epigenetics is a topic that deserves further study and its' own series of posts.",5

2020-05-14 11:07:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gjo3zk/defining_moderate_drinking_when_science_says/,Defining Moderate Drinking: When science says enough is enough," 

As seen in [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/201907/defining-moderate-drinking).

For many Americans, summer is the most relaxing time of the year. Particularly when the weather is nice, millions of people around the country choose to spend the day or evening outside, enjoying the company of friends and family while lighting up the grill and having a few drinks. It has become an American tradition.

Casual drinking on occasion poses very few immediate threats, provided one is not pregnant, on certain medications that interact with alcohol, or planning to get behind the wheel or engage in any other kind of potentially reckless behavior while the acute effects of alcohol intoxication are felt.

Once the effects have worn off, there is little long-term damage that can come from the occasional glass of wine, beer, or spirit. If done frequently and in large amounts, however, alcohol can become a major health risk. Constant and heavy drinking is associated with a host of ailments, including liver disease, heart disease, diseases of the digestive tract, and cognitive decline. Furthermore, alcohol abuse and alcoholism can also wreak havoc on one’s familial, social, and work lives.

This should not be groundbreaking news to anyone. However, there is a vast middle ground between having one drink every now and then and alcoholism, and the truth about the potential risks to one’s health when it comes to moderate drinking are blurry. On the one hand, moderate drinking is not a universal concept. It changes from country to country. On the other, recent studies have contradicted the age-old wisdom about the benefits of what constitutes moderate drinking in the minds of the public. Even moderate drinking can impact one’s[ life expectancy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361830134X) and [cognitive function](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00081/full), and the risk of stroke, heart failure, hypertensive disease, and fatal aortic aneurysm [jumps significantly](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361830134X) even for those whose drinking may seem to be less than problematic by some standards.

Consequently, the commonly held belief that moderate drinking may be better for one’s health than abstaining from alcohol entirely has become a difficult proposition to maintain universally. At best, moderate drinking may have certain health benefits, but these benefits may be outweighed by its risks.

What follows is not a condemnation of moderate alcohol use. While many of the facts conveyed in this post may sound as though they are meant to dissuade individuals from drinking, the goal is not to pass judgment on behavior or to make the argument in favor of abstinence. The intention of this post is to merely relay information on what the most recent studies say about moderate alcohol consumption and to provide a better definition of “moderate drinking.” Anyone who is legally allowed to drink can then do with this information what they will, though it is recommended that they do so in a responsible manner.

**What Is a Standard Drink?**

What defines a “[standard drink](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/what-standard-drink)” varies by country. In the United States, a standard alcoholic drink contains 14 grams of pure alcohol. In the United Kingdom, a standard alcoholic drink is significantly smaller — 8 grams. In much of Europe, the standard is somewhere in the middle (typically 10 g or 12 g).

In the US, 14 grams of pure alcohol is equivalent to the following:

· 1.5 fluid ounces of spirits like vodka, rum, or whiskey (typically around 40% alcohol)

· 5 fl oz of wine (typically around 12% alcohol)

· 12 fl oz of beer (typically around 5% alcohol)

It should be noted that these are rough guidelines and that there can be significant variations between types of alcohol, particularly when it comes to beer. While most mass-produced beer is close to 5%

alcohol, craft beers can range from 3.5% to 18%. Luckily, most craft brewers now indicate the alcohol by volume (ABV) contained in their beer on either the can or the bottle to avoid confusion.

Variations in ABV may have a far larger impact than one assumes at first. For example, if two people each order a beer at a pub — one individual having an imperial pint of Irish stout, one individual having a pint of India pale ale — neither will have a standard drink. An imperial pint of the most famous Irish stout is 20 oz of 4.2% ABV beer, which means this one “drink” contains 19.591 g of pure alcohol. A pint of an IPA that is 6.0% ABV, meanwhile, contains 22.399 g of pure alcohol. By US standards, the one Irish stout is about 1.4 standard drinks, while the pint of IPA is closer to 1.6 standard drinks. To the two individuals enjoying their beers, however, they will probably think that they are only having one drink.

**What is Moderate Drinking?**

Like a “standard drink,” “moderate drinking” can have several definitions. In common parlance, a moderate drinker is someone who does not drink to the point of drunkenness unless on special occasions. It is a nebulous concept that people often use to distinguish between a heavy drinker — someone who may frequently drink to the point of drunkenness — and the occasional drinker or non-drinker. These are not scientific terms by any means; they are merely the phrases that have come to be adopted by individuals in their day-to-day use of language, and their definitions are highly subjective.

Conversely, there are official standards for “moderate drinking” that are based on [analyses ](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh23-1/05-14.pdf)of safe or low-risk levels of alcohol consumption. Like “standard drink,” they vary from country to country. For example, in the UK, “moderate drinking” is defined as consuming[ 14 standard drinks](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-45043178) per week or less. This is the equivalent of six pints of 4% beer or seven 5 oz glasses of 12% wine. In the US, the[ guidelines](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/moderate-binge-drinking) for moderate drinking as established by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture are an average of two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women or less. When one consumes more than this amount, it is referred to as “excessive drinking” by the [guidelines](https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-9/), which note, “Excessive drinking increases the risk of many chronic diseases and violence and, over time, can impair short-term and long-term cognitive function.”

**Moderate Drinking for Men and Women**

Studies have shown that women often feel the acute effects of alcohol sooner than men, as women tend to weigh less than men, have less water in their bodies than men, and produce less alcohol dehydrogenases (a class of enzymes that allow us to metabolize alcohol) than men. Hormones may also impact the rate at which alcohol is metabolized. Due to these differences, what constitutes moderate drinking for a woman is often thought to be less than what constitutes moderate drinking for a man. These distinctions are codified in the US guidelines, the Canadian guidelines, and the [Irish](https://alcoholireland.ie/alcohol-and-you/guidelines/) guidelines. As noted above, these distinctions are absent from the UK guidelines.

When one examines the long-term effects of alcohol consumption, it appears as though the UK guidelines may be more accurate. One of the most comprehensive [studies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361830134X) on alcohol ever conducted was published in the Lancet last year. With a staggering 120 co-authors, the paper examined individual-participant data from almost 600,000 drinkers across 19 high-income countries who had no previous cardiovascular disease, and found, among other things, that there is not a significant difference between the amount that men and women can drink over the long-term without suffering from a decrease in life expectancy. The study’s authors wrote that, “For all-cause mortality, there was a positive and curvilinear association with alcohol consumption, with the lowest risk for those consuming below 100 g per week… Associations were similar for men and women…but weaker at older ages.”

“In comparison to those who reported drinking >0-≤100 g (mean usual 56 g) alcohol per week,” the authors of the study [continued](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361830134X), “Those who reported drinking >100-≤200 g (mean usual 123 g) per week, >200-≤350 g (mean usual 208 g) per week or >350 g (mean usual 367 g) per week had shorter life expectancy at age 40 years of approximately 6 months, 1–2 years, or 4–5 years respectively.” They also found that, “Men who reported consuming above the UK upper limit of 112 g per week had a shorter life expectancy at age 40 years of 1.6 years…and men who reported drinking above the US upper limit of 196 g per week had a shorter life expectancy at age 40 years of 2.7 years…compared with men who reported drinking below these respective upper limits.”

In other words, the study’s findings indicate that moderate drinking for men and women should be no more than 100 g, approximately the same amount recommended for women by the US guidelines.

**Additional Risks**

The groundbreaking study did not only examine life expectancy. More narrowly, it found that those who drink more than 100 g per week increase their risk of stroke, coronary disease excluding myocardial infarction, heart failure, and fatal aortic aneurysm, even after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and history of diabetes. Conversely, the researchers found that drinking more than 100 g per week correlated with more non-fatal myocardial infarctions than fatal, though they noted that this benefit does not outweigh the other risks associated with drinking more than 100 g per week.

The study did not have access to enough information to determine if alcohol was linked with additional adverse outcomes, including non-fatal liver disease, injuries, or psychiatric comorbidities, though another study did recently find a systematic bias in previous studies claiming that moderate drinking can protect cognitive function as the body ages. A [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00081/full) published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience by Linda B. Hassing of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden claims that such studies were flawed because their control groups included numerous non-drinkers who had only become abstinent because of health issues — including alcohol abuse earlier in life.

Hassing also found other key disparities between the control and the drinker groups. The controls had, on average, a lower education level, a lower socioeconomic status, a higher body mass index, and higher rates of diabetes and hypertension. There were fewer smokers, however. Still, the main finding of the paper was that, when the abstainer bias was controlled, it was found that, “There was a negative and not a positive effect of light alcohol intake on cognitive performance.”

Hassing also called into question the current “safe limit” for men and women, as defined by the US guidelines. “Given the results from the present study, these guidelines may potentially be too high.”

**Final Thoughts**

As these studies have shown, even moderate drinking is associated with numerous risks that outweigh the benefits of drinking more than 100 g per week. However, this was not an indictment of alcohol or a plea for all people to abstain from drinking altogether. It was meant to clarify the numerous definitions of “moderate drinking” to allow individuals to improve their ability to make their own life decisions and to better understand the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

To calculate the number of grams in a drink, the following equation was used: Volume x (alcohol by volume x volumetric mass density) = pure alcohol mass.

· For the stout: .591 l x (0.042 x 789.24 g/L) = 19.591 g.

· For the IPA: .473 l x (0.06 x 789.24 g/L) = 22.399 g.",8

I emptied my spice bottle as I was noticing side effects. I then transitioned to weed every day for my daily THC fix, and smoked pot daily for about 3 months just to sleep. On my 15th birthday I did a few lines of cocaine, which transitioned into a full blown panic attack. 

After the panic attack I decided fuck drugs. I haven’t picked one up since and I’m 16 1/2 now.

She responded by telling me if it makes me happy then so what. But it’s not so what. My tolerance is getting higher every day and I’m scared I’ll switch to something more and worse and when I tried to explain that she just told me not to.

-I truly enjoy the taste of beer and the taste of whiskey.  I love trying different ones, different flavors etc.  
-it doesn’t disrupt my life really.  I don’t drive, don’t act out in significant ways, don’t do anything significant while tipsy that I wouldn’t have done while sober
-it’s not a financial burden.  Yea I guess I would be spending less money if I weren’t buying it but it’s not affecting my finances

What makes me thing it is:
-I can’t NOT do it.  If I ever said “how bout I just don’t drink tomorrow”, I wouldn’t go through with it
-it’s definitely almost always to the extent that I couldn’t legally drive.  Doesn’t seem smart that basically I am guaranteeing myself that every single day I can’t drive after like 9 pm

Since breaking up I've noticed a lot of holes in her life stories, this one really bugs me. She has perfect teeth, she's not missing any, no decay, doesn't ever need any dental work. She even got braces 5 years ago to correct childhood crooked teeth.

I smoke occasionally, not even because I crave it but because I'm bored. I pretty much only smoke in social settings - I'll have 3 a day at absolute max while at home. When I'm staying with my parents I don't smoke at all, and I don't even crave it.

I used to take 250-450 mg of codeine daily, and after stopping pretty much cold turkey I didn't get any noticeable withdrawals. I was using kratom though so that probably helped a lot. Kratom's another substance I have no desire to try again.

My current poison is Valium. I managed to source a fuck ton so I've been binging on them and planning to taper myself back to normality when I run out. It's currently the only addictive drug I'm on bar cigarettes.

I am however intensely addicted to the internet. At least 10 hours of my day is spent in front of the computer.

Does anyone else feel like this? I feel like I have a dopamine deficiency which is causing my brain to seek out novel experiences constantly in order to satisfy itself. I have an entire dissertation to do and I just spent hours scrolling through twitter and youtube.

Any tips to break this habit? I'm planning on getting a whiteboard and putting a list of tasks I need to complete on it to motivate me.",2

The picture on the left is me in a rehabilitation center, shortly after I was discharged from the hospital. After years of addiction, what I knew was coming in one form or another finally came, and I needed heart surgery, followed by months of I.V. antibiotics, to save my life. MRSA bacteria had gouged a one inch hole in my heart - this is called endocarditis, and it kills as often as not.I very nearly died, and at the time I thought I wanted to. 

The picture on the right is from a couple weeks ago (please forgive the “thirsty shirtless”). In the time between the two pics, I got sober, relapsed, got sober again, and relapsed again. But I kept working at it, and with therapy, lots of help from loved ones, and a bit of yoga and mindfulness practice, I’m not almost a year sober and am totally confident in my ability to stay that way. It has been hard, and at times it seemed pointless. But at this point I have more good days than bad days, and I have changed nearly everything about my life and living situation in comparison to a couple years ago. So I guess my message is that recovery is possible. Even from the darkest places, it is possible. A couple of years ago, I didn’t expect I would live long past 30. Now I’m working (granted, not my dream job, but still), have my own place, and have actual goals beyond the next shot.

Now let me start this off by saying, I know that by just taking Adderall, you become dependent on it due to what it does to the CNS and all that. I'm in school for nursing and I've done a lot of pharmacology. 

My husband has been using Adderall for about 4 years now via a prescription and he instantly changed after 2 months of consistent use. He is extremely moody, easy to anger or to get upset. His moods flip, he can go from being completely okay to angry or aggressive in a manner of minutes. He gets  verbally abusive with me, tells me that he's leaving, tells me I'm useless and not a good mom..I knew something was going when he would hide the bottle from me, he would take it to work with him so I wouldn't ""take any"" or ""count it."" I am not on Adderall and never have been so him being paranoid about me taking anything from him was very odd. He is quick to get angry and go and hide out in his man cave with the door locked. When I knock on the door, he either outright refuses to open it or take longer than 60 seconds to open the door. He's even gone as far as to change the lock on the door so that I won't go into the room when he's not home.

I have found evidence that he has sniffed his Adderall, about 9 months ago I found straws hidden in an empty canister in the man cave when we were cleaning.

I'm lost as to what to do. He says he doesn't have a problem and that what he does with his Adderall is not my business..

Who should I call or reach out to? One of my friends said that I should report him to his doctors office but I don't want to deal with the wrath of him over that one. Does anyone have any personal experience while dealing with this or any helpful websites?

Thanks.",3

Around a month ago, I found a broken pipe in the trash can I thought it was one of my glass oil bottles but it was not. It was clear with a round bottom. I confronted him about it and of course he lied and deflected finally he admitted he has a problem. He has an addictive personality. He quits one and it is replaced by another. I’m not quite sure how to handle this. He told me he was done with whatever he was smoking he said oxy(?) but would not explain further. 

Fast forward to tonight, I found it in the closet. Now I have to be honest, I knew he was hiding something but would blow up every time I would ask. But tonight.... I found the pipe (used) and lighters. 

I’m not sure how to handle this. I placed in a ziploc back and hid it. 🤦🏻‍♀️ What scares me is the wrath that will come once he discovers it gone tomorrow which is why I’m thinking maybe I should put it back?  

I know it’s a case to case basis but I honestly do not know how to support him without feeling like I’m questioning him like I’m a detective. He states that he feels suffocated that he can’t do whatever he wants. My “what are you doing?” Out of curiosity he takes it as “whatever you’re doing you can’t do that” Like so defensive and starts yelling at me. 

How do I support and help him stop? Or can I only do one of those and hope and prays he stop? I feel like if I turn a blind eye I am just enabling him. If I don’t ask questions, I’m enabling him. 

I know I am at fault somehow, this can’t be all him. I don’t know, but can someone please point out what I might be doing wrong and tell me what I should be doing?

I've known my ex for 9 years. Co-workers first, then friends for the first 5 years. Nothing ever happened in that time, not even flirting. Then we lost touch, but obviously regained it otherwise I would not be writing this. We dated off and on for 2 years, but his addiction to meth and coke left me broken, broke, and heartbroken like I've never experienced. Over the next 2 or so years we had sporadic off and on contact through phone only. We're on separate coasts.

A couple of months ago, he reached out to me and we've been texting every so often to check in. About 6 weeks ago he informed me that he has moved on to fentanyl. He's ODed and been brought back with Narcan 8 or so times. He said if he continued like this it would kill him and he knew it. 
Shortly after telling me that, he checked himself into detox and then went to stay at a rehab/sober living house. For the last two weeks we've been texting and talking daily. He seemed like he was doing well after we talked last night. 

I know that this is going to be frowned upon cause it usually doesn't help or work, but want to add that in one of our first few daily talks, I made it abundantly clear that if he were to use again, I would remove myself from his life. Basically the ultimatum of ""you can either have me as your friend in your life or the drugs in your life, but you cannot have both"".

There's a significant time difference between us and this morning he called me super early (on my time zone) because he was having nightmares again. I talked to him for about an hour and when we hung up, he seemed okay, not great or good, but better than when we started talking. 

Two hours later, I get a call and he's bawling his eyes out. He took a bus ride back to his old stomping grounds to pick up mail. This area is a heavy drug use area. Apparently he found a full baggy (I don't know of what) on the ground. He said he didn't know what to do and he was scared that he was going to die if he took it. Then he said he wanted to die because he was sick of feeling empty and lost and alone going in circles with his addictions. That he didn't want to feel like this anymore. 

Without judgement I comforted him, pointed out the cons, pointed out how far he has come, talked to him about all the things he had told me he wants to do being sober, how this bad moment isn't a life sentence, etc. I asked if he called his sponsor and he hadn't, but said he would and he wanted to get off the phone with me. Then radio silence for over hour. The whole time, I'm scared shitless. I don't have his sponsors information so I just had to wait. 

I finally get a text, not a call, that he was at urgent care.

He threw away the drugs and took himself to urgent care to be 5150'd. He asked if he could put me down as his emergency contact and for release information contact. I definitely said yes.

Never before has he thrown away drugs. Even going into rehab he would do his whole stash on the way there before walking through those doors. 

I am so fucking proud of him. I love him and will always love him. I told him all of this before they took his phone away. I told him I was here for him even though I'm not actually there. I told him that I believe in him. 

I'm just in shock. I'm bawling my eyes out. I can't share this when anyone I actually know because they would be against me have ANY contact with him due to what he put me through when we split and would probably cut me out of their life so I'm posting here because I need to get it out.

I might have saved his life and I don't know how to feel about that. It is very overwhelming to think about and I cry every time I do.",5

I don't mean hard addictions like meth that can make you relapse. The Idea is that exposure would activate brain parts associated with self control and make them stronger over time. 

Of course in the beginning when you're trying to quit something it can be useful because you can find the best ways to ignore your craving and improve mindfulness to stop yourself if you did one step towards the bad habit. But when you develop your ignorance is it better to expose yourself to the trigger from time to time on purpose?",6

As a kid to help my parent with money I had an older sibling who decided to deal drugs to the “upper west side” version of our town. I used to always cover for her when she would go to parties and she would often bring me. This exposed me to the drugs,sex, and partying scenes before I even turned seven. 

Didn’t help that we shared a room either, I used to always see her and her friends/customers pop pills. Her telling me not to touch them didn’t help either, made me want to touch them more. Elementary school me , thinking that these pills are like Advil, decided to take some. The beginning of my slippery slope with narcotics.

I haven’t used since the sixth grade when my sibling eventually moved out. I never told her that I was swiping drugs from her and quitting cold turkey almost killed me. I’m soon to graduate and I don’t really know what the hell I’m doing at all.",5

We've been together for 7 years and have a daughter who just turned 5. My life is just not where I want it to be.

My fiancee and I both messed around with all kinds of drugs when we started dating. She eventually just stuck to weed while I messed around a bit more with psychedelics and ended up getting hooked on Adderall. Things went south and we split for a year and then got back together. It's been Rocky but we've been stable for about a year now. 

I quit Addy almost 3 years ago but then devolped a bit of a drinking problem. She smokes almost all day everyday. I started to quit drinking a few months ago and found myself massively depressed. I also realized I haven't accomplished any of the goals I wanted in life. I got back on Adderall a month ago to help with focusing on family. It's worked to get me to a spot I want to be at and I'm not refilling the script. But I know I'm going to end up going back to alcohol.

I just want a normal happy family and we don't have that. Our daughter is the sweetest thing and always happy and we do pretty good as parents but I know we could be doing so much better. And I want to provide that. I don't want her growing in a house of substance abusers.

I just want to be able to help my family grow into something great. Where we spend our time and energy on bettering each other rather than using substances. I'm just not happy with where things are going.

I'm finally ready to quit everything. I'm getting ready to set up therapy and rehab if I need to. My probably is that my fiance doesn't think her weed smoking is a problem and she gets very defensive when I bring it up so I just dont talk about it anymore. But it needs to be a team effort here.

Do I just focus on making myself better? I struggle with that when she's still smoking as much as she does. 

I guess, really, it's just time to have a heart to heart about it. I probably just need to lay it all out with how I'm feeling. I've tried bringing up bits and pieces of how I feel but I get shut down everytime. I love her so much but right now discomfort for the way our family is growing is stronger than that love and i just don't know what to do. 

I'm just so tired of the life I'm living. I know I can be so much better. I know I can accomplish so much more. I know my relationships and friendships can be so much deeper. And i know the source of the problem is substance abuse and not being assertive when I try and talk about it. 

Shit, I don't know if im even posting this for advice anymore or just getting this off my chest. I don't want to bother my friends with this because we are just starting to rekindle things. Anyway thank you for reading if you've made it this far, I appreciate it.",11

I've been into asphyxiation most of my life, but never really acted upon it all that often. Usually when I did, it was just some light playing on my own. Before anyone says it, yes, I have always been aware of the dangers of autoerotic asphyxiation.

With everything that has been going on, I started playing a bit more, but this time also using a different knot. Oddly enough, the actual noose I'd used before was less effective than just a simple doubled up loop. Unlike before, when this was all just a vehicle for better masturbation, and I'd usually be done before I was ever actually hanging, now I am actually letting the rope press so hard into my neck that I can begin to feel myself getting close to passing out. Now, as in the past, I always rely on the simple safety method of the rope only being run over a beam and secured by my own grip. That still leaves the possibility that if I pass out, I'd fall without being able to stop myself and break something. Back to the point, I'd never actually felt the sensations I'm feeling now. It's like everything closing in around me, odd auditory hallucinations, near complete disruption of my cognitive abilities for several seconds, etc. As strange as it sounds, I think that letting myself get so close to passing out is starting to become an addiction. I do this almost every day, sometimes more than once a day. I even think about it while I'm at work. (Yay for still having a job right now I guess?)

I've had minor issues with depression in the past. I'm worried that part of me is secretly hoping that I take this too far. I'm not sure what I'm actually expecting from posting this here, but I felt like I needed to get it off my chest.

tl;dr: Becoming addicted to hanging myself close to passing out.

Edit: Probably not relevant, but I don't even masturbate when doing this now and yet I still want to keep doing it.",1

Long story short I spent three miserable days in a holding cell and have 2 misdemeanor charges. I couldn’t even try to think of it as a turning point or take it as a lesson. All I could think was “once my bond is set and my parents bail me out I’m gonna get high”. And then after they took me under their wing, offered me a place to sleep, eat, and showered me with their love and understanding, I had someone drop off a bag and used. What the fuck is wrong with me? Two years ago, I was a good high school student, AP classes, holding offices in clubs/extracurriculars and now my name is in the county arrest reports and I can’t stop using meth. I want to find a hobby besides drugs. The boredom is what’s leading me to relapse so often. I want to find something that brings me a feeling of satisfaction, occupies my time and is accepted by others. In the meantime, I feel like life is pointless and that simply existing is a painstaking chore. I know I must quit meth for good if I want to have any quality of life and be a productive citizen, but meth is the only thing I see worth doing as of now.

That I’m in control because the last time I did it was so long ago since I manged to wait so long compared to what I used to do I’m not gonna fall into addiction again or habitually using again well I was wrong. I binged for a few days & almost fell back into that life style. The only thing that stopped me was the fact that I ran out. 

I’ve been trying to recover from abusing drugs & alcohol for a while now. I thought If I allowed myself to heal I could use them occasionally/ every now & then as a one of, & it would be okay, like normal people do right. Well I was wrong. I’ve realised my brain is not wired to ever be able to use drugs in moderation no matter how stable I am before hand or how well my life is going. 
Using drugs just makes me feel dirty now. I’m miserable when taking them, because I’m using them to escape. & I’m even more miserable on the comedown & actually suicidal. 

So I guess the positive to come out if this is that it’s taught me what it’s gonna be like every time I realapse. And that I can never use drugs again. 

I used to live life looking forward to the next time I do drugs, there wasn’t anything else worth living for for me. Now I actually want to live! I want to get back on track again. I want to enjoy life without it being fake reality.",1

im typing this right now on my first line of the ball, and here i am, feeling altruistic and willing to help any and everyone that needs a hand, voice, or just some company.

i love being nice, but it only happens with the euphoria of drug use, and i hate it. mind you, even before use, i was never really a friendly person, and i never got anything done. 

when my senior year rolled by, vyvanse and cocaine got me through ap calculus and the maths i wanted to excel in. i used to be a procrastinator and ive always had a self-hate issue, but now, even during comedowns and whatnot, at least ive seen what i CAN be, if that makes sense.

today i think i can pat myself on the back for giving my mother a rather enjoyable day, but equally harbour shame for myself with the amount of sporadic bathroom trips i made in order to do so.

although there are times where i can feel like the 'king of fucking everything', in reality, i do what i do because the actions i do and decisions i make with the influence of stimulants make me a good person, when the sober-me wouldnt have the heart or motivation to spare.

am i trapped? of course the drawbacks get horrendous, and what i say is in no way shape or form endorsing use at all, but as i cherish every hour i feel this caustic joy of dopamine, i feel no reason to stop unless i end up heating my powder in a spoon.

does anybody else feel this way? that cocaine makes them do ACTUALLY good things aside from getting things done and having a good time?",2

i guess all i wanna know is if it’s worth telling or if i should keep it to myself? idk what will cause me more harm and distress.. telling them and potentially have to deal with the consequences of being labeled an addict or continue to live alone with my experiences and trauma connected with it?? :((((",1
2020-05-09 22:00:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ggsopv/parallels_between_ptsd_and_substance_use/,"parallels between PTSD and substance use disorders (SUDs): understanding the ""emotional brain"""," parallels between PTSD and substance use disorders (SUDs): understanding the ""emotional brain""  
sources: ""the body keeps the score"" by Dr. Bessel Van Der Kolk and ""The biology of desire: [**addiction**](https://drugs-forum.com/wiki/addiction) is not a disease"" by Dr. Mark Lewis  


The psychiatrist who wrote this is an absolute genius and truly an incredible, rare person. He defines the limbic system as the ""emotional brain,"" but the structures contained within are relevant to much more than just emotional processing. They are involved in motivation, pleasure, desire, learning, memory, and more. Understanding the limbic system is incredibly important in the understanding and treatment of both PTSD and addictive disorders. This limbic system/emotional brain and the ""rational brain"" (prefrontal cortex, or PFC) become temporarily very disconnected in instances of both PTSD and substance use disorders, and they overlap in both intuitive and statistically significant ways.  


Experiencing 5 adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increases your chances of reporting addictive substance use by an incredible 1,000%, and an ACE score of more than 6 increases your chances of becoming an IV [**drug**](https://drugs-forum.com/wiki/drug) user by a jaw dropping 4,600%. More than half of all people seeking treatment for substance use disorder report going through traumatic experiences. The persisting illegality of some drugs has made people that are coping with post-traumatic stress by using these street drugs out to be literal criminals and led to the systematic and non-stop traumatization of entire communities.  


People who are self-medicating with drugs to cope with traumatic experiences or [**anxiety**](https://drugs-forum.com/wiki/anxiety) or [**depression**](https://drugs-forum.com/wiki/depression) in the first place wind up in a criminal justice system that is highly conducive to more trauma, abuse, violence, neglect, stress, anxiety, and depression, among other things. It's almost as if criminal justice system is designed to stress us out, cause us pain, traumatize us, and break us- because it is.  


This might've made sense hundreds of years ago. After all, humans do sometimes behave like stimulus-response animals: we touch a hot stove, it hurts, we learn that hot stoves are dangerous and not to touch them. The human brain and the behavior it produces is far more complicated than that, though, and its' capacity for automaticity and adaptation can go wrong very easily, as it does in the cases of PTSD and SUDs, both of which often lead to more dangerous, maladaptive behaviors.  


The systems in the brain that underlie our basic survival instincts are the ones that are awry in the first place, and putting disordered human beings in cages and letting us literally fight for social dominance while being surrounded with armed guards like we are animals that need to be controlled causes us to act more animalistic, which causes further disengagement from our rational brains.  


In jail, we remain in survival, fight-or-flight mode all or most of the time, which causes even further change to this limbic system, further downregulates crucial [**dopamine**](https://drugs-forum.com/wiki/dopamine) receptors, and makes the PTSD/SUD symptoms even worse, effectively turning people into more impulsive, disconnected, and disordered versions of themselves than they were when they went into their cage. We must also consider the higher criminal education they receive while caged up. Then, we let those people back on the streets, with their even-more traumatized, stressed, dangerous, disordered brains along with diminished opportunities due to their criminal background and new criminal connections that they made while in prison, which makes them much more likely to act out in maladaptive ways and makes this entire epidemic much worse.  


I'll do another post on the information in this book that was relevant to the [**opioid**](https://drugs-forum.com/wiki/opioid) epidemic and the war on drugs because there was so much of it, and the more research i do, the more sickening a picture is painted for me. The war on drugs is a war that is based in xenophobia and racism and enacted on chronically traumatized, impoverished, helpless minority groups, and we must end it- yesterday.  


Besides the limbic system, which i understand to be our subconscious emotional-motivational engines, Dr. VDK also mentions what he calls the ""mohawk of self regulation"" which has been changed in both trauma survivors and people who survive addictions. I'd use the term ""damaged"", but changed is a more scientifically accurate term.  


Our brains are changing every second and with every single one of our thoughts and actions, and though lessened activity or hyperactivity in certain brain structures can have a tremendous impact on our entire experience of living, brain change does not necessitate brain damage or disease. I've read elsewhere that Dr. VDK even mentions to other doctors that the ""disorder"" part of PTSD could be dropped- after all, if a lion bites your hand off, your brain could best ensure its' survival by making sure it never, ever forgets that experience. It does this by remaining in a hypervigilant state: always on the lookout for lions. This post-traumatic stress wouldn't be a disorder if you were wandering a lion-filled savanna, but the constant hypervigilance caused by these now easily-triggered and constantly secreting stress hormones is the result of a real brain change- and it is a NIGHTMARE to experience in your body.  


The ensuing brain changes to both the limbic system/emotional-motivational engine and the ""mohawk of self-regulation"" means that both those dealing with post-traumatic stress and people struggling with SUDs are disconnected from their sense of self. They have less control over their behaviors, emotions, thoughts, motivations, desires, impulses, ability to focus- they even have a disrupted ability to learn and store memories. These changes are empirically testable, physiologically observable, and very, very real, and the result of these changes to this ""mohawk of self regulation"" adds to the lessened impulse and emotional control and inability to think clearly and rationally. Not only this, it also gives you the feeling of being a stranger in your own body; feelings of serious disconnection from yourself, your identity, and your own bod- on top of an inability to regulate and control yourself.  


Hypervigilance means a constant secretion of stress hormones, which often leads to drug use. The stress or “anti-reward” systems are well known to be very important in the understanding of SUDs. The subconscious brain ""keeps the score"" of our traumatic experiences by keeping us on edge, and it also keeps the score of what takes that edge away by deeply remembering whatever gives us relief, which leads us back to substance use disorders.  


One could easily see how this could become a vicious cycle: self-medicate for natural hypervigilance or the hypervigilance caused by post-traumatic stress by using a substance that causes further disconnection between our rational brains and the emotional-motivational engine, while the war on drugs creates the perfect circumstances for us to get traumatized and stressed out again and again, leading to further disconnection and unavoidably, the criminal justice system, where people clap and cheer as the cell door slams shut and we ""get what we deserve"".  


The ""mohawk of self regulation"" and the emotional-motivational engine are changed in both SUDs and PTSD, as illustrated by the attached pictures. The last pictures are from Dr. Mark Lewis's book, ""The Biology of Desire: Addiction Is Not A Disease"", which I highly, highly recommend and included to further illustrate how incredible and significant the overlap between these disorders is as well as to hopefully interest more people in these subjects. Dr. Lewis also talks at length about the limbic system, though he calls it the ""motivational core"" of the brain.  


Either way, there can be no motivation without emotion. Our emotions are a way for us to assign value to things. Those emotional values motivate us to move towards things that feel good and away from things that feel bad. We don't stick our tongues out when a fly passes us by because we aren't frogs; we need an emotional drive to be motivated to move towards something we like or away from something we dislike, and strong emotions create deep, powerful memories which lend themselves to habit.  


Our brains are very parsimonious in how they spend their energy, and the more behaviors that can be automated and delegated to unthinking habits then the more time and energy we have to think and wander and judge- and the more energy we have stored to use in instances of threatened survival. Skinning an antelope could be delegated to the subconscious parts of the brain, so the hands can move habitually and automatically, while the conscious, rational brain can use precious energy to scan the horizon and ensure physical safety.  


These processes backfire when the subconscious brain is programmed to automatically grab drugs or [**alcohol**](https://drugs-forum.com/wiki/alcohol) upon sight or anticipate sexual assault when seeing a person with short, blonde hair- because a person's sexual abuser had short, blonde hair.  


Proper connections and communication between the emotional-motivational engine of the limbic system and the higher-thinking, rational brain are key to controlling ourselves- and self-control is the greatest predictor of success.  


After all, what good is a steering wheel if the engine is unpredictable or totally uncontrollable? How can anybody succeed in life if their emotional-motivational engines are physiologically disconnected from the structures in the brain that give them a sense of identity and self; the ability to reason and make clear decisions? How can a person have purpose and drive without even a sense of who they really are? How would punishment help this person in any way?",42

The years I've spent wasted never really went to waste, as they can be used as an example to not be that way.

Hi.  I'm an active duty service member who has been in addiction for years.  7 to be exact before I joined the service after I got clean the first time for 9 months and joined.  I made a name for myself, became independent and successful, and had everything I always dreamed of truly having.  A happy marriage, a nice place to live, a car, etc.  I lost all of that over the course of my first deployment and spent 45 days in a rehabilitation center.  My wife decided she wasn't happy with me anymore at that point and moved on to someone else.  I spiraled out of control.  No money, car, place to call my own, etc.  I stayed with someone I hadn't spoked to in months because I didn't have a choice and every single day for 2 in a half weeks I was around substances.  You know the saying, if you hang around in a barber shop long enough you'll eventually get your haircut?  Well I was hopeless and I got my ""haircut"".  I told the counselors I did magic mushrooms under the impression it was supposed to be anonymous and they called me in 3 days later to let me know they had no choice but to report it to the command.  That was where my active duty service ended I spiraled a little further.  I had no bed, lived out of my backpack for 2 weeks in the worst part of my city with random people coming in and out.  At one point I was used to that, but I was military.  I grew out of a bad enviornment and didn't want to be back in it but I had no choice at that point.  A month and a half of that I had saved up enough money to move in with some good people, who I'm incredibly grateful for.  3 days later I got a DUI.  They support me along the way.  I've been sober a couple of months now and I'm feeling better, but I'm still hungry for success.  The past isn't what defines us, it's what we do with our future..  Any questions just ask!",24

even though i can say i hate drugs and they’re all straight from the devil, i can’t stay away from them anymore. i’ve tried countless times to try staying sober for good and i used to be able to stay clean for a few weeks or months but ended up relapsing eventually. and a few weeks ago i tried committing to staying sober for good again, but my usage is very different than it was before, and i didn’t even last 3 days before relapsing. i used to have some control but within the last few months it has seemed like my substance abuse has been getting worse and worse at an alarmingly fast pace. i binge a lot more, i do more dangerous drugs more often, i’m never sober for more than a day or 2, i don’t even smoke weed anymore because it bores me and i’d rather do the harder stuff... what?! 

i’ve been in many different hospitals and programs for all the mental health stuff i’ve struggled with for years and only brief minimal treatment for my substance use. but being through all those programs has educated me a lot and has led me to knowing myself VERY well like knowing when i really need help and when something isn’t good. so i do know myself, and i can clearly how all the shitty drugs that i do negatively affect me, i want to stop, and there are countless reasons for me wanting to stay sober and never touch a drug again but i waited too long and let it get too bad for me to be able to get clean on my own anymore.

these past few days i’ve been on another amphetamine binge, and every night on the comedown i start to feel like shit, of course, but the strange motivation and being so hyped up while feeling absolutely horrible at the hands of drugs has made me strongly consider actual residential rehab for the first time. i can’t continue on like this, i just want myself back. i hate that i let my addiction get so bad that i’ve ruined my life, relationships and that my entire future is not gonna be the same as i had hoped it would be. i hate myself for not having enough control but i know it’s not my fault and that i’m sick. i’m doing the best i can and even just considering getting help is huge for me. 

i’m beyond scared to open up to my family and ask for help and actually try to get into a program because part of me doesn’t want to stop getting high ever. and i especially don’t want my family to worry and stress themselves out, so that’s why i’ve hid so much and kept a lot of my drug use a secret as much as i could so i could just do my thing and have no one worry. 

but i know what i need, and i know if i don’t try to get help soon i will get even farther into a hole of even worse drugs and will stop being willing to seek treatment. i also know that if i continue on this path i would most likely end up dead before i’m 21. i’m glad i’ve been able to come to terms with this and realize it’s a real dangerous problem and i cant just keep trying recovering alone over and over again just to relapse and get worse. i really want to change and i really want to be happy again. 

i want to believe i’m strong enough to be able to kick addiction’s ass for good if i do get into a rehab facility. the hardest parts will be having to be honest and open up about everything i’ve hidden so long, and of course withdrawals and cravings. i have a very long road ahead of me but i hope it’ll get less rocky and steep soon. wish me luck",5

I saved your life today. I came to pick you up and when they went to get you they said you were unresponsive and they didn’t know what to do. Another guy went down and tried to wake you and told me to come in and help. I ran down the stairs and you were hunched over sitting on the edge of the couch in front of a coffee table. Tin foil balls all over the table and ground, your veins were bulging and you didn’t appear to be breathing, your skin was turning blue. What do we do? Apply narcan? Call an ambulance? Roommates said whoa YOU should take him to the hospital. 

I snapped my fingers, shook you and clapped my hands in your face all while yelling your name. You just sat there.  What felt like hours passed then I heard you gasp for breath. Your eyes didn’t open but I saw them move. “HEY! WAKE UP!” I yelled “name, name WAKE UP!” your head flew back and you mumbled something I couldn’t make out. “HEY!” I. clapped my hands and shook you. You jolted upright and stumbled into the table knocking over a open 2L bottle of pop you swayed in the spot mumbling looking around with your eyes closed as it glugged empty making a puddle at your feet.

 I then noticed you only had one shoe on but your socked foot was not in the pop. You rubbed your face with  both hands then finally looked at me and said “what?” as if I was intruding and stumbled away. “where the fuck are you going” I asked. “I have to pee” you said irritably as you walked and stumbled up the stairs. I followed you up and you walked to the bathroom and stood in front of the mirror swaying. The colour was starting to come back to your skin but you still looked grey. I just realized your extremely skinny, you’ve always been thin but you look anorexic. you turned and brushed by me going back down stairs. 

“are you okay? What the fuck is going on? Are you okay?” I asked and you looked at me and said what are you talking about? I was just sleeping. Your adamant that you were just sleeping and tired. Exhausted even ""BULLSHIT"" I say, your full of shit there’s drugs everywhere down here your fucked up! wtf you’ve been clean! you’ve been doing good what the fuck happened here? 

Your still adamant it’s in my fucking head I only see what I want to see, your just tired, ""I need rest I need to relax"" I can tell your mind is racing and your struggling to keep coherent. You sit down and close your eyes, your slipping out of it I can tell. I scream your name and shake you and make you stand up and your back. Staring me in the eyes you say ""what the fuck are you doing."" ""I’m fine I’m just tired.""  You stumble away still with one shoe on into another room in the basement and turn the sink on. You stand there hunched over the sink not moving water running at full blast. “NAME""  you jolt up. What??? You walk away leaving the sink on. I go turn it off and follow you back into your room. The table is cleared off of all the tin foil and lighters and you have a cigarette lit, your back. Your coherent, your awake, and most importantly your alive. 

Your still not making sense. ""I’m just cleaning up here I’m packing to come down"". I cant believe your gonna try and brush this off like nothing happened I thought. You keep telling me I’m imagining it and over reacting. You admit that ""yes you needed a quick fix"", that I don’t understand that you need it. Your life is shit. you cant change it and you just need to be at peace. I said get your shit your leaving this place. You tell me you have to go to the pharmacy you need your meds. Your suboxone. It’s what keeps you clean. You haven’t done opioids in 4 years but I’m pretty sure you just did fucking fentanyl. In fact I know you did cause you told me you had a quick fix.

 I get you outside and as were walking to my truck you vomit all over the driveway. Your embarrassed and scream fuck and storm to the backyard lighting another cigarette. You come back and ask one of your roommates to clean it for 10 bucks and he says yes as you hand him a bill. What the fuck is this place I think to myself. You come back to the truck and open the door then stammer ""ahh one sec"" and run back towards the house. Did you vomit again? Were you grabbing drugs? I don’t know.

 You come back and say ""okay let’s go"". I drive away and your paranoid asking where were going I said ""I have to go to the department store by 5 and its 330"" you say ""don’t worry I’ll stay in the city I cant go to the pharmacy now I don’t have time"". ""Shit I need my wallet"" you say so I said  ""I'll take you to the pharmacy it’s fine I have lots of time"" and go back for your wallet. You get out and go back inside for 10 minutes I’m starting to worry. You finally come out and get in the truck. Your awake and coherent we get to the pharmacy and you go inside. 30 long minutes go by when you come back to the truck. You get in and apologize. Saying you didn’t mean to scare me and that you got a number from the doctor to call for help. 

You rest your head against the window and fall asleep. Breathing normal. I get to dept store you wake up and get into a fight over the phone with the ex over the kids. You want to see them you havn’t seen them in months because of covid. She promised to come today but that was at 10am and it’s now almost 5pm. You now say your staying in the city your gonna call a cab. ""I’ve been with you since 1:15 and after all that your just gonna bail and leave?"" I ask "" you don’t understand"" you say. ""You’ll never understand"" and storm off frusterated. You come back after some time and help load my items into the truck. You get in the truck, your gonna come to town, your gonna relax. You fall asleep. Breathing deep and hoarse. You slept the whole way home and when we got home you slept all through the night. 

I saved your life today and I don't think you even care.",44

My entire life [up until recently] I have been someone you can count on, extremely punctual, I wouldn’t let anyone down, not even the smallest favor in passing, the co-worker you’d assume died because they aren’t 15 minutes early to the jobsite. I don’t know exactly when this changed, but it did: drastically and at an exponential rate. Age 18, I was working at a gas station and started installing floors with a regular customer, turns out installing floors was so much better than being a cashier, paid a whole lot better too so i quit the gas station. I’ve never been close to my family. My parents are rich alcoholics that for the most part had always taken care of my monetary needs, but they were never there. My grandparents on the other hand were, every single event big or small. 4 years of high school and my parents hadn’t showed up to a single sport event, I was always a loner. Senior year of football I had quit the team right before homecoming, after learning my parents weren’t going to be there to walk me on the field as was the tradition. The thought of my parents being called and having me walk onto the field by my lonesome curdled my blood, I couldn’t stand the very thought of it. After 2 years of installing floors, I decided it was time to start my own business, the person who had taught me floors was moving out of state, he really was the father I never had. So I started, it was fantastic, and I was good at it. So good in fact I could afford to hire my closest friend and our work, nor friendship suffered because of it. Two months in my grandparents die, it was devastating to the entire family my drunkard of a father was into the booze even harder than I’d ever seen. He was having seizures, pissing himself, and fainting from it. I would wake up every morning at 6am to see my father on the couch drinking himself to death and I soon followed the sorrow. I was cracking open a monster and filling half of it with black velvet before 7am every morning. My flooring business was still fine despite how fucked up I was. A few months later I tore my mcl as was unable to work, I eventually had to stop flooring and at this point my drinking was at peak. My parents never supported my flooring dreams but it truly was a dream, I wish I could go back...I’ve haven’t found a job since I was so passionate about despite the hard labor. I found my way into construction, and at first I didn’t hate it, but i was working for a shit company who did shit work and it drove the passion right out of me. I started taking adderall in the mornings to bounce back from the handle of whiskey I killed the previous day. I did this over and over and over again. I feel like I woke up one morning and stopped caring about **everything** adderall wasn’t enough anymore, I was drinking my daily handle passing out waking up to adderall and when that wasn’t enough I started cocaine. So Drinking a handle of whiskey taking 2 adderall and snorting rails as I’m driving into work in the morning. Here I am now, wondering what I do with the bridges I’ve burned and the life I’ve ruined. I’ve since stopped my coke habit but can’t escape alcohol and adderall, I don’t care about anything. And I mean anything. I’m constantly skipping work without so much as a white lie to cover why I’m not actually coming in. I’m aware of all the pain I cause myself but just shrug it off I’m tired of killing myself everyday. I used to confront responsibility and expectation with a smile and an attitude like “I can’t wait to impress you” now I can barely justify getting out of bed in the morning, I skip work, hide in my room, avoid bills, etc. I literally just don’t care about anything anymore. Even when I know I’m shooting myself in the foot. I attempted suicide recently but was cut short at the thought of all my friends that I know would do anything to help me through if they even had the slightest clue. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I feel caught in my own web of bullshit and feel like I’d rather kill myself than tackle the problems at hand. I don’t know if this will help me in the slightest. This is the first time I’m sharing any of this with a single soul. I’m so lost.",11

2020-05-08 04:48:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gfphqc/first_post_here_need_some_support/,"First post here, need some support","Hi,

I'm a 21 year old guy and I used to love drugs but now my life is miserable. I keep wanting to write about my story but it's all so fucked up in my head Idk. I can't think and I don't want to be high anymore.

I've fucked around with most drugs and I like the majority of them. If the alternative is being sober tho, I'll literally do anything I just need something. And idk why because being sober feels fucking better than drugs at this point. But when I'm alone its like a fucking compulsion.

I'm really addicted to ketamine. (and weed, and nicotine, but those can wait) I don't even like ketamine anymore and I get panic attacks almost every single time I come off it now. And then I wait it out and when I get ahold of myself I go snort more. It's so fucked up. I know it is. I feel so trapped and I feel so confused all the time. I feel like people think I'm fucking stupid because I can never talk because I'm in a k-hole!!?? I ruined this drug by teaching myself how to function somewhat normally on it and just fuckin live my life on it. (obviously not in a hole 24/7 but my tolerance is high so I can function even when I'm close to one. Sometimes I fuck up and take too much and do hole around people. I make it work. It's not fun.)

I'm living with my parents during quarantine and I'm high on ket nearly every second that I'm with them. i can spend hours hanging out with them and re-upping in the bathroom and they have no idea. I feel like a piece of shit. I am a high achiever and work really hard in my job and in college (somehow) so my parents think I'm really clean cut and shit. they're also really anti-drugs, would be pissed if they even found my weed.

This exact time last year I was a recreational drug user and not an addict. Yeah I'd tried just about everything, and my drinking was probably a little too heavy. But I was okay. Ketamine was my favorite though and I was careful not to abuse it because I was getting a little worried with how much I liked it. Anyway, on May 14 2019 my best friend/cousin/basically twin brother killed himself really, really unexpectedly. No goodbye, no note, nothing. We were in an argument and he was ignoring my texts so I wanted to give him some space to cool off. I found out the next morning. Anyway after that happened I started doing ketamine like every waking moment and I haven't really stopped since.

In November I got surgery and I talked the doctor into giving me vicodin instead of tramadol. i went through that shit fast and managed to get two more fills of it before they started denying me. In February I bought roxycodone from a plug and started snorting it with my ketamine basically every day. At this point I had already been binge drinking every weekend and mixing ketamine and benzos when I drank. So one day I had been doing oxy all day, thought it had worn off, took an ativan and got blackout drunk. Woke up in an ambulance with people all around me SCREAMING at me. ""ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF??"" It was really, really fucking scary. Apparently I died and was revived.

Anyway I committed to getting clean after that. And I even joined my school's sober recovery group and it seemed like people cared about helping me and maybe I could do this. And then COVID started and all of that disappeared. Everything became about the pandemic and every person in my support system stopped giving a fuck. Every single time something really bad happens and I really need help people pretend to care for like a week max and then forget. So everyone just thinks I'm clean now I guess lol. No one cares to fucking ask how it's going, that's for sure. My parents don't know much but they do know I have/had a drinking problem since the OD, but my gf knows all of it and so do my roommates/best friends. But it really feels like no one gives a fuck at all. And no one even notices because I'm back on my daily ket use and my moods are fucked and I feel like I'm dying. Idk how to explain I never got clean I just acted like I did. All I quit was drinking/benzos/oxy and I'm kinda proud of that but ketamine is ruining my life

I didn't mean to write that much. Thank you if you took the time to read this. I know ketamine isn't the most common addiction but if anyone can relate to what I'm going through even for a different drug I'd love to hear from you. I just want to feel less alone and worthless",5

Recovering alcoholic, pill abuser, porn addict etc. I’m proud to say that this is my second night in the last two weeks that I’ve had some alone time at home without relapsing on anything. It’s really great and I’m very happy about the progress.

Without writing a history book, I’m grappling with the nature of my relationship with my mom and sister. Simply put, I had to make the hard choice to draw some very hard boundaries with them and dysfunctional behavior/disrespect toward my marriage and while we are slowly reconciling, the truth is that there is a ton of strain and perhaps damage that won’t heal.

I love my mom and sister to death. Growing up, it was mostly just us three between the divorces and hardships. My sister and I were best friends. 

Unfortunately, the relationship between us has always been dysfunctional and toxic, and standing up for my wife and I when some bad games were being played was both important and heart-wrenching. I would never take my decision back one bit, but I wish I didn’t have to make it in the first place.

It’s typically when I struggle with the guilt, anger, confusion, and longing for a healthier relationship with everyone that I get tempted to relapse. Fortunately, I’m not home alone (my in-laws are here), and I’m a lot more equipped to deal with these feelings than I was before, but I’d be a fool to assume I’d be OK if I was home alone either way.

How do you guys stay sober amidst these sorts of struggles? How do you deal with the truth that, maybe, things won’t get that much better with family in the end?",7

I dropped $80 buying him whatever the fuck he wanted in hopes of cheering him up, came up with ideas of things to do to pass time until the big day, planned his entire birthday party, bought him the best gift I could afford to give him that meant something, curved his negative comments.. until he got condescending.

You are genuinely changing lives by bringing people together and showing them they are more powerful than their addiction.

My name is Tyler and I am 24 years y/o from Toronto, Canada. 

I always knew growing up, that my mom was addicted to opiates because it was never really hidden from me. Drug vocabulary was very prevalent in my family from an early age, and we even began to take trips to the methadone clinic every Thursday, so mom could get her OJ. I can remember as a young child, seeing my mom dig her teeth down onto a leather belt, while we watched the TV in the living room, just to try to get through the agony of the withdrawal. I knew she had a drug problem but I always thought it was pills like, pain killers and that she would just deal with her addiction in her own way. (Boy, was I WRONG)! I began to become more passive and numb with the whole situation as I got older and as the negative patterns became a repetitive frequency loop of realizations and let downs.

The emotional conversations always seemed to happen around major holidays after a long night of eating and drinking excessively with her family. One Christmas, she broke down and asked, ""if I told you I have done needles would you give up on me and leave my life?"" Those kind of words would just tear me apart because there is nothing I want more than for her to feel enveloped by my love, compassion, and support and to know that all the emotion I show, whether it is negative or positive, is out of absolute passion for her well-being. This conversation was where I realized for obvious reasons that the problem has grown into a monster that is now unignorable and needed to be addressed. I knew that I was in for a rollercoaster of deep, devastating lows and possible fulfilling highs from the emotional war that I was about to take on.

I decided to take the approach of starting an entirely open dialogue, where we would be able to talk honestly about her pain and addiction that she has been going through for the last 20 years. A lot came up, like almost everything! I learnt that she had been shooting pills for many years while taking methadone at the same time and that her life revolved around those drugs. Of course it has gotten painful at times to understand the severity of the situation, and it is defiantly a strange thing when your perception on someone, especially somebody you love and have ""known"" your whole life, changes and you are able to see them differently, like in a whole other light completely. Different than the comfortable boxed up, ideologic version of a person, that you have built up in your head. But I believe that embodying unwavering love, leading by example, and creating a structure of support, is the most important thing to embed in her mind that I am with her for everything, through it all, because she is worth it. 

Our first real conversation was long, and emotional, but those hard conversations are determinably necessary for anything in life worth working on and bettering. It took a whole year of those challenging conversations to build this new style of tell me anything/ honest speech, that I noticed her narrative shift from self pity loathing in her situation, to optimism and hope for the future. 

I challenged her to be her best self and to tackle the hard things and she started by quitting her long time addiction to cigarettes and began to become more excited about life! 

5 months ago my mom threw away her needles in front of me without me even addressing the subject, all on her own free will. That was a POWERFUL moment. That's when I knew she meant it because I had lived a life her closetting the most major part of herself from me, to putting it all out on the table and making the decisions and most importantly taking ACTION! 

She has been going down 2mg each week since she has quit the pills and as of this week she is down to 12 mg of methadone! I am extremely proud of her and I can tell she is really proud of herself because she says it often and tells me that her methadone doctor believes she is going to be a success story. She just recently started telling family that she has had a problem and that she is on the road to recovery, she says it's best to tell people because it motivates her to succeed, and people are welcoming her with open arms! Although there are a lot of positives right now, I do still see moments when she doubts herself and gets overwhelmed by the possibility of a withdrawal  that is unbearable to the point of relapse. She doesn't know the road ahead of her and her anxieties often become an instable in her recovery. It is hard for me to get in that mindset myself because I have never quit a drug before and I have tried to explain to her in a recent conversation, that I am there emotionally but it is hard to talk so much about the drug aspect of things. She has voiced that she would really like to connect with someone through pen pal or video chatt that has gotten off opiates and methadone, to talk about what their experiences were like because a lot of the information online is very generic.

What do you think the best way is to go about our situation during this pandemic? Not enough people are addressing how hard it is for people that are dealing with mental health and addiction during these hard times and how there are limited resources available. Is there anybody or any groups that we can reach out to online to get some guidance.

I can see so many posts from people saying they’ve been clean from X for Y time and it’s amazing ❤️ - i just need some advice ??

I’ve been using ketamine for over a year now, at first it would be every weekend, gradually would increase to a couple of times a week. I was a student so it was pretty easy to go out on the weekdays. 

Anyway, over the last 6 months it’s got pretty out of hand and I’m having at least 1g a day - most often 2g. I want to try and stop but it’s become such a coping mechanism which I’m sure a lot of you guys understand but I just don’t know how to deal with it. 

I don’t know how to spend my time sober, I’ve forgotten what I used to do? Does anyone have any advice as to how to go about reducing/stopping use without going stir crazy? My willpower is fucking shit because I feel so low all the time — but I know this is due to my drug use/drinking as coping strategies. My head is just all over the place so if anyone has any guidance, I’d be really glad to hear it

So my sister is 11 years older than me and she's addicted to marijuana, and alcohol. Lately she's been snapping at me and basically everybody else for very small things. And she lives w my grandma, but she doesn't pay rent yet has a sort of aggressive territorial attitude when it comes to my grandmother's apartment and wants me and my sister to leave. 
She's more sensitive emotionally than she used to be, but in a way that's bad for her. My grandma doesn't want her to smoke and she gets mad at her for telling her to stop while shes living in her house. But she doesn't and my grandma lets it happen. We're in a pandemic and smoking and interacting with other people increases your risk, but she smokes marijuana at least 4-5 times a day and goes out everyday and interacts with people. Despite my younger sister having a compromised immune system and my grandmother being extremely old. 
She's been going through a rough patch ever since her dad died, which I can understand, but she seems like she doesn't have any general concern for how she makes other people feel and even herself.

So I've been experiencing weird anxiety spikes over the past few weeks or so when I've gone a few days without a drink. I previously didn't connect the anxiety with drink because my cravings for drink are sometimes there but minimal, I've just been drinking to take the edge off long days working at a supermarket and because I do go several days without drink cause I don't feel the need to -- and that's when it gets bad, retrospectively looking at how i previously felt. However, this anxiety I get is noticeable and has started to disrupt my sleep.

Regardless, I've decided, obviously, to stop drinking for the next few months and any deviation from that I'll see as a major failure. I've conquered dependencies and addictions worse than alcohol so I don't think I'll have a problem with this, I'm just disappointed in myself that I've fallen into this. 

What I need advice with is how long realistically will it be before I can have a drink again without prompting my body to have withdrawal symptoms. Will it be possible for my body to not be acclimatised to alcohol after consuming alcohol in the future? Or will I have to deal with this feeling to some degree in the future whenever I consume alcohol? 

I appreciate any responses I'm just really worried about the long term impacts this will have on my health and just need some piece of mind.",4

2020-05-07 07:43:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gf4z4x/i_feel_invisible_as_a_victim_of_solvent_abuse/,I feel invisible as a victim of solvent abuse,"How many times in your life have you been told about the negative effects of drugs and alcohol? How many times have you heard the statistics? How many times have you had that conversation?

Now, how many times have you had that conversation about solvents? I can imagine a lot of people reading this will laugh at it, laugh at me, for even considering it an issue. Any time the topic's ever been brought up around me, it's been in humour. About sniffing glue or the smell of fuel at a petrol station. I find that unfair. 

It's unfair because solvents took over the majority of my teenage years, and not even my closest friends knew about it, not even the countless therapists I saw over the years. I thought I'd be laughed at, I thought it wouldn't be taken seriously. Because of this, I didn't really see it as a problem myself. The stigma around it needs fixing.

Here's my story:

I'm an abuse victim who's been clean from inhaling deodorant for 6 months and 2 days. Yes, I'm counting, because back when I wasn't clean, it felt like I was waiting for death. Now it feels good to count the days that I'm really living. It's not something I think I've ever written about, it's something I didn't want to admit was a problem because I was so addicted to not feeling anything except a daze and a few hallucinations here and there. But, whenever I was sober I would catch myself in the mirror and question myself. Am I going to do this for the rest of my life? Why am I living like this? Can I be sober?

I genuinely, for a very long time, thought that being sober wasn't an option. You hear about it from alcoholics but the difference was that I could semi-function on my high, which means I could work or see my partner or do some writing whilst I was intoxicated, a skill I had developed from doing it for around 7 years (consistently for 3 of those 7).  This made me feel like it was ok, but I also knew that it could kill me on any high.

On the canisters it says 'SOLVENT ABUSE CAN KILL INSTANTLY' and I read it before every fix. I knew it could kill me, and I didn't know if I cared. Why would I want to keep living the way I was? How can I live every second I have alone getting high? Every day could've been my last.

Was I going to jeopardise my relationship, my friendships, my family life, for the sake of getting f\*cked up and forgetting about the pain? This ultimatum made me quit very suddenly. I just decided that that was it. I thought to myself that maybe going out and walking my dog, making dinner with my mum, cleaning the flat or spending a night with my best friend laughing and getting tipsy would replace the high, maybe I could forget about being an abuse victim by doing things that are GOOD.

3 whole years of constantly being high, I started when I was about 12, and became fully addicted at age 16 is all gone and I'm not going back to it. But I am a real victim of this powerful thing, this thing no one talks about. I no longer want to feel invisible or embarrassed about my addiction because I know for damn sure that I fought that battle and I fought it hard, I'm not allowing that to go unnoticed anymore.

Roll-on deodorant it is.",2

My brother was recently sectioned under the mental health act UK as he went missing and tried to take his own life. He had racked up quite a lot of debt whilst dealing with cocaine and gambling addiction. 

He was recently discharged and staying at my other brothers for a week. He has asked to stay with me and my fiance as there's isn't any space at my other brothers who has two small boys.

I've been told by my second brother that he bought more cocaine while staying there so has relapsed.

I live in a different city on the other side of the UK so am hoping his lack of contacts here will make it easier to cut those ties.

I'm mostly looking for advice on what to expect and how to help my brother when he stays with us. I've told him he can stay here as long as it takes to get him on his feet. 

My fiance wants to help but is worried about the strain as it's already a bit tense with us being in lockdown.

I have posted in the past and received some invaluable help. However, as time goes on, it has become clear that she just needs someone to feed her habit, she recently started stealing from my Mum. So she locked up the cash in the house, up until a few weeks ago things escalated.   
She came in, took an iPad off her son (my Mum looks after him) demanding money from my Mum or else she is going to sell it. It was screaming and shouting until the next-door tenant walked in, and my sister handed back the iPad and disappeared.   
Then a few days later, my Mum paid money to rehab to admit my sister. Would be the 40th rehab if not more. She stayed a week and walked out.   
Since then people that know my our family started dropping food at my Mum's gate, someone then told us that my sister is going around saying my Mum is struggling if they can help with money.

Then today she walked and took my Mum's iPad and ran for the car. She had the wrong door access, and my Mum and the tenant who overhead the ruckus was able to catch her. She refused to give it back unless given more money after things got heated and other people walking by she let go of the iPad and she and the boyfriend raced off.   
We have given multiple opportunities to improve her life. The list is long, she has been in rehab many times, I gave her a job with 0 stress more than once. Tried giving her love and support and she still used, she has been given thousands, but every time its this will be the last time.   
I do understand this is not easy for her nearly impossible to quit the habit, but it been over 20 years now where we supported her in every way possible. And both my Mum and I feel that we get hurt every time she comes into our lives. Damaging her kid in the process, who knows she is ill but never talks about it. (14)

  
I am shaking with anger, and being on the other side of the world, feel helpless. She has hit my Mum before and she could do worse.  And I am here stuck.

Started masturbating when I was 12. Still doing it many a times. It has interfered with my school performance, and other fields of life. Occasional smoking at 14 and 16 (sometime drinking too). Chain smoker at the rate of 10 cigs a day, sometimes on and off. Many people tried to stop me but I didn't listen to anybody. Took from 16 to 22 to complete my degree, that too with very low grades. About to turn 23 this year. Overdosed thrice on alcohol very badly. Most of the time I was trying to fit in some group that was really unnecessary.  Still unemployed and posting this from my dad's internet connection (lol). I'm suffering from narcissistic personality disorder as well. I'm just a middle class guy, so more frustrated as ever. No one has a history of these 4 addictions in my family. I couldn't handle very simple tasks also you know. My lies have pulled down my life. I've stolen money from a good friend of mine to support my addictions. I've taken small  debts from many people as well to support my addictions. I'm a burden to this earth, as I have abused these substances even after knowing the consequences. I would just smoke weed and masturbate using a condom (since I don't have a gf, so it gives a virtual feeling of sex). I would just fap on instagram models or porn basically. I would heighten my sexual desires with weed you know. But it has impaired my learning, cognition, and memory to a large extent. I'm unable to feel positive about my life and I've literally made my future bleak. I had no reason to fuck up my life but I still did chasing those petty and temporary pleasures. I've never listened to my friends, teachers, parents, and basically anyone who gave me good advice. I've drunk/stoned texted the girls of my class as well.

Please help. Any way to make my brain sharper and regain the memory loss caused by these 4 addictions? No financial security for me as well.

Bc I held my pills, tight as a glove.

It ran my life with all its might,

But here today, I continue my fight.

My fight and drive to be clean,

Difficult and tough, man it’s mean.

This dreadful battle I’ve lost before.

But I’ve had enough, it won’t take more.

Though I fear that my love is done.

I pray everyday that she sees I’ve won.

That I trade my addiction from this drug,

To her amazing loving hug.

Because this girl is so special to me.

When I’m with her all I feel is free.

As it stands now all I do is cry,

But my worries run dry when I look in her eye.

What her and I had was absolutely perfect.

But I messed up and became an addict.

Bc of that I deeply apologize,

I just wish you seen this pain in my eyes.

Bc this fight is brutal and painful,

When all I want is you, then I’ll feel full.

Addiction is not enjoyable or fun.

So I fight this fight so I can be done.

Don’t get me wrong I made the mistake.

And here lately I’ve been feeling fake.

This person I’ve become is not the real me.

It’s just been a hard battle, to set that me free.

And though this fight is hard I’ve learned clues

To make it certain that I will not lose.

I will always be here for you my soulmate 

Bc we belong together, I know it’s fate.

I just lost my way this one last time.

Bc if I’m not done I can’t call you mine. 

So I’ll finish this fight and make it end.

Bc I can’t stand life, without my best friend.

You look like an angel, you’re so beautiful.

When you say you love me, it’s so meaningful.

You’re so pretty I could stare all day and night.

I’m having a bit of a difficult time with my rewards mentality. This coming Sunday will be my one year abstinence from drugs and alcohol. Saturday if you count the fact this year is a leap year... In addition I’ve been making a lot of progress in other areas. I’m coming up on my one year at work, and doing well there, despite the pandemic. I just finished a course I needed for my bachelors degree, and I expect to finish one more soon in order to finish my degree. My last sexual reoccurrence was a few weeks ago. I can’t remember exactly when. I’ve acted out four times since the end of last July, so I feel like I’ve made progress there and with my mental state. Things are going decently well at home. I’m working things through with my wife, and my family is healthy for the time being. I’ve been trying to quit smoking after having been up to a pack a day and been seeing results. I don’t usually smoke anymore but when I do, I maybe have a few cigarettes a day. I understand I’m in a drastically better place than I was a year ago at this time. And I want to be proud of myself for everything but I don’t feel like they are accomplishments honestly. A part of me feels like staying clean and not smoking are things I’m supposed to be doing anyways. And as for the things like work and home life and school, are also things that I should be doing naturally. I feel like making healthy decisions and healthy practices are necessary. I half feel like they aren’t accomplishments. If I feel like they are, they are things I want everyone to see because I want the recognition. And because I can’t get that recognition and I know it’s not healthy for me to seek it out, I need to find pride in myself. But I can’t find that pride in myself for what in reality I have been accomplishing. So naturally as all addicts do, I want to seek out comfort in my substances, rituals and behaviors. Additionally, because I know I should be proud of myself and I’m not, I want to try and reward myself to help condition myself that when I do well, I should be happy and proud of myself, but because I used substances and behaviors for so long, it feels like the only enjoyable rewards for myself would be those substances and behaviors that I know I shouldn’t have been participating in originally. Logically I know that all of those substances and behaviors will bring me nothing but unhealthy pain. So I’m doing what I found works, and trying to push myself towards the healthy pain by reaching out and talking about how I am feeling.",1

(Addicton was  thc/nicotine/psychadelia)

So i just left rehab today, 
had a really good bond with my group. Made a lot of friends in that place. I came into the rehabcentre selfanxious, paranoid, scared, depressed and addicted. The staff there aswell as my fellow groupmembers helped me pick myself back up. I skrewed everything up before i got there, got kicked out of my house, school and got fired from work. Stole from my family, all around did terrible things to everybody around me. 

I thank god for giving me the strenght i needed to rebuild my life and reastablish my relationships with my family and friends. And to quit smoking all together.
I got to admit it feels weird being outside again, on the one side im happy and proud i did it. On the other side im scared that ill fall back into using and mess it all up again.
I gotta stay strong. Thought id write this on here, maybe it will help me straighten my thoughts.

Best of luck to all you fellow addicts out there!
You're not alone!!

I can do whatever drug and just put it down, but not this one.

Meth creates an Alter-Ego personalized perfectly for the destruction of YOU. And she loves to look at the choices she’s got laid out for her and pick the most toxic, horrible, and destructive choice possible. When she weighs out the pros and cons, the only acceptable pro is “higher”.

I’m really a piece of shit. Like I am dragging down the people I need to build up, dragging down the people who looked up to me all because i like fucking heart palpitations and being delusional. Meth is something fucking else.

When I’m sober, I feel nothing. I feel so emotionless. When I use I feel content at the bare minimum. When I’m sober, I get the urge to cry but I can’t. It’s harder to laugh and smile when I’m sober. And when I’m sober I’m just blank, I don’t even get angry. My feelings are the equivalent of a blank piece of paper. And when I use I can let my feelings out and experience SOMETHING.

Using meth has been one of the single most worst decisions I have ever made. At least I don’t like smoking it, it’s a different high and I’m not about the way it makes me feel. I’ll stick to my bloody noses.

Getting clean is so much easier said than done. I was sober for about 6 months before, and the cravings never subsided. I know they never will for the rest of my life. I can’t even take a T break because after you use, your tolerance never really goes down. You never really sober up 100% after being clean. After you use, your brain is permanently damaged. I can feel the brain damage. I really can. I struggle with so many things I didn’t use to, like my speech. It also takes me a while to process new things I learn sometimes now and it’s frustrating because I just can’t comprehend what I’m trying to understand sometimes. I used to be really good at spelling, but now I sit at my keyboard and wonder how to spell “help”.",82

I am a 23 year old male, living in a metropolis in Canada. I suffer from ADHD, take meds more often than not and it helps. I also an addict. Been smoking weed since 16, had phases with pills, powders/crystals you name it, but now my problem is mostly alcohol/weed/nicotine.

I’ve hated myself for years for it and an at the point of accepting it, but quitting needs to be done. I can’t moderate. I KNOW that I can’t quit on my own just like that, living at home where I live, stuck in the quarantine.

I know it sounds like I’m making excuses, but I have tried SO, many things to distract myself while sober. I’ve been working out at home, learning spanish and german, learning piano, always trying new things during the day to keep me distracted and satisfied.

But then the night comes, I’ve done whatever I have to do (thanks to ADHD meds), I become so restless, agitated which leads to my nightly indulgence.

To finally cut to the chase, I am not someone who can easily be distracted by things. After trying so many things, I have no passion. I will not do scrapbooking, or art, etc, because I know it wont last and EVEN when I DO try, just to see, nothing pleases me like the booze.

Thanks in advance to anyone who reads, don’t really expect an answer to help but it feels good to get this off my chest.

TL;DR Everything I try bores me quickly due to ADHD and addiction and I cannot find consistent distractions/replacements/passions to replace my bad substance habits.",1

Well I quit about 8 months ago, haven't touched it or seriously desired it since then. I am very proud of myself and have been so much happier in life, but lately shit got kinda weird. Since I've been out of work due to current circumstances, I've been getting so many thoughts about coke. Like thoughts about everything about it, the memories, people, feelings all associated with it, which is not like me at all. I almost started feeling like I was going through withdrawals again. But I haven't relapsed or gave in because I really don't like who I am when I get a hold of that drug, but I found out why I've been feeling like that.

So, I went back to work yesterday, and I drank my normal few cups of coffee throughout my shift, I hadn't had any coffee for the 5 weeks I've been out of work. It never used to make me feel jittery and gross. Yesterday it did, it made me feel disgusting and like I was high on coke again. Then, I figured it all out, that the caffeine was giving my body a similar high to coke (and tbh my coke was probably usually cut with caffeine). But, the reason I never realized this or noticed the feeling of it before is because I was usually on at most 2mg of Xanax everyday when I was drinking all the coffee. I am no longer taking xanax so that's why I was able to feel all of the caffeine now.

I'm just kind of pissed at myself for not noticing that that's why I was drinking so much coffee, and now I have to deal with a fucking caffeine addiction. I don't know, in a way I feel like I'm cheating by basically getting high on caffeine because it's replicating all of the same feelings from when I used to always be high on coke (but I'm trying not to be hard on myself). Even though I hate how it makes me feel, its hard for me not to stop chugging coffee, and I was the same way with the coke. Haha look what I got myself into, well wish me luck.

Tldr, I got stupidly addicted to suboxone(never been addicted to any opiates) , I feel like it improves my life in every single way possible except sleep. I don't know if or how I could come off of it as I think I'd lose myself. 

I have never done any strong opiates in my life at all. So I have never used suboxone to get me off any kind of opiate, it has become my opiate.
I was at a point in my. Life where I would really try just about anything and I've never had an addictive personality (other than vaping/nicotine)

One day at work this new guy started working there and we got to talking. He just got released from prison recently and had started working at the restaraunt I working at at the time. We talked about drugs we done and I said I tried percs once or twice, no big deal.

Somehow it got brought up that he has this crazy drug on him and I asked if I could try it. He said it's some serious shit and reluctantly gave me some, mind you it was a ridiculously small amount. I'm talking about micrograms not even milligrams, maybe a 300mcg of suboxone crushed up. I went and did it and I was in heaven, everything was better.

Things happen and eventually I ended up buying about 10 pills, this lasted me close to 3 or 4 months, so the dose I take every day is miniscule, I've been addicted for almost 2 years now and I don't know if I can stop. I've tried before and I got horrible horrible withdrawals. I'm scared to lose my current job because I can't be going through withdrawals at work as I'm a power engineer.

The hardest part about all of this is that I feel like this drug has improved my life in every single aspect. Except I don't get restful sleep anymore. I was diagnosed with narcolepsy as Id fall asleep at the snap of fingers when this stuff wears off.
I feel amazing on it, I'm faster, stronger, wittier, I'm way better in bed, I have a desire to learn and study and make myself a better person.

I'm scared to quit, I feel like it is who I am now and removing that would burn alot of bridges, I need some advice or help from anybody please.",2

I started tearing up and needed to leave before I full-on started balling. 

 I can't really explain it but it was just so different hearing it come from a dealer's perspective. Like someone who profited from selling drugs actually refused to sell to me and then spent time convincing me not to go down that hole again. For the first time, I actually properly want to get sober and not just reach those milestones. 

My past dealers were always a bit sketchy and really touchy ( like I couldn't be in a room with them longer than 10 minutes without feeling the need to run out of there). This is a completely new experience that I wasn't expecting.

Has anyone else had a similar experience where your dealer prevented you from relapsing in some way?",100

I am a foreman for a forestry crew. My objective is to ensure safety and well being (among work guidelines) of my crew of 5 other people. One of these people i qm aware of having substance abuse issues (im not sure which drug, but ive heard they prefer pills.) Anyways. This person is shy, has admitted to being self destructive under stress. Although they have gone a few weeks here and there sober, i was looking for some advice on if there are any signs i should be aware of of usage/withdrawal and how i can make it as easy as possible on them, transitioning to a sober life.
What we do isnt an easy job. It requires isolation from nearby communities in a camp, and many of the days are spent alone doing extremely difficult work and mostly alone. Im worried that the withdrawal and negative thoughts will hinder thier performance and potentially affect thier addictive thoughts. (Although i know this person outside of work and am making it sort of a goal to assist them in any ways possible as they do not want to continue thier usage, and are using this job to help get them away from the city/usage)

What kind of things have been done for you in the workplace or in home life that has helped you out, and what should i look out for to detect a relapse or usage? Is it relevant to me what they are used to taking? 

Thanks for any help, i hope this adheres to this subs guidelines.",1

I had so many people message me with support and it was really, as sad as it may seem, one of the nicest moments for me.

Unfortunately it hasn’t got much better. I’m now, again, homeless. I have thankfully managed to get a place in a homeless shelter which has been really hard, especially when trying to combat my drug use. There has been so little support from services over the whole situation it has been one of the worst times of my life sleeping rough for weeks and pleading with everyone for somewhere to stay, and then having to travel from Glasgow to West Lothian with £1.20 and bags full of clothes.

I’m still on the drugs and trying hard to get myself better so I can hopefully leave here. Because it’s emergency homeless accommodation I’m only allowed to stay for a limited time, and I could get kicked out as soon as tomorrow, only arriving on Sunday night. 

Hard times for those with addictions, I hope you are all doing well. I don’t know if anyone gives a fuck about my wee update but just in case.

I told myself I can’t get a tattoo until I have a year clean off of heroin (I just passed 3 years no dope and no needles!). I also told myself if I want a tattoo, I have to wait a year and see if I still want it. This is to avoid any regrets. I’m definitely sure of what I want now. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has any experience with covering their track marks. Have you regretted it? I have a huge scar on my forearm that I’m not even sure they’ll be able to cover. It was from an abscess I had to get drained from shooting Coke. I also have a pretty bad scar from surgery when I got a needle stuck in the crook of my forearm and had to get it removed. 

I just hate my track marks. My left arm is so obvious. Like I said I haven’t touched a needle since December 2016. I can still see most of these marks. I just had a baby about a month ago, and I had to get the routine blood work done. I just hated how some of them looked at me. I also just graduated from college and I’m planning to start my career once the baby is a little older and this Coronavirus has calmed down.

Hi fellow lifestyle livers and others.. I am here to recommend a book to a bunch of people who may not be usual novel hobbyists, yet I feel as if the people here who submit daily answers to text-based questions and discuss this daunting lifestyle late into the night would love to read a very specific piece of literature that will really speak to many of you, and also introduce you to a long-forgotten lifestyle that while might relate to our psychoactive schedules, is actually a fascinating contrast to the way we discuss our substance-use and how we as society see it in general. This book is written by quite-likely the last Western user of traditional, authentic East-Asian opium vapor: [Steven Martin (links to New Yorker article)](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/25/paraphernalia) who was (until his unfortunate death due to Heart Cancer) was originally a sober collector, yet ironically fascinated with the modus-operandi of the ""Smoking Pistol"" , a term for the Opium Pipe itself. (which was the original item of collection for Martin) Eventually, Steven's collection began growing to include many different Opium pipes, oil lamps, opium trays, and other authentic antiques which are all used in the traditional Asian opium dens that Steven would eventually become a usual visitor of. He writes about the last wave of backpackers, tourists, and experienced users who live and travel in the eastern-continents that are home to these backrooms with worlds of their own hidden inside of them, and the rooms themselves hidden to the fast-moving world just outside of them. This book details all the fallacies that other 21st century media has brought upon the ideal of Opium use and dens, the world that the people who use Opium live in, and documentation of not only Martin's modus-operandi, but eventually the daunting modus-vivendi that he must deal with as he not only eventually after even having year long spouts of use that do not label him an addict, he finds himself a true-to-himself opiate addict. But on top of that; an addict of such old of a psychoactive substance, forgotten by the world and traded by much of the world for it's more potent and refined formations, due to eventual stigma of opiates, (a recurring world topic) and also because of opium's somewhat tedious assembly necessary for traditional usage. In a world where many things have been automated or made to be ""plug-and-play"" so to speak, Martin's story teaches us much about the origins of our lifestyles and how interesting and historical our addictions, which these days are much-of-the-time written off as a stain of the modern world, when at one time tradition and religious icons were included in construction of the paraphernalia , sacred gems crafted into the beautiful items of a lifestyle which is gone, in a sense, but has also morphed into what many of our lives are today.

And when you make it over following peaks you make a habit out of applying the necessary effort.  That’s the example you need to set for yourself to repeat again and again.",44

Since I was 15 I’ve struggled with several different substances(mostly cocaine and benzos). I’ve always had a bit of an addictive personality, but it never got really bad until I tried DXM. Don’t get me wrong, DXM is an amazing drug and it has given me so many positive experiences as well as all my friends. Most of the time it’s all fun and games and I’ve learned life lessons from some of my trips. But it also has a bit of a dark side, and while it isn’t physically addictive the thought of it just throws away everything I know and drags me in. 

I was using it every 2-4 weeks until last week, when I got a lot more than I should have at once. I went through easily 12 doses in 3 days, and have been binging on and off since last Friday. I’ve overdosed on it many times, always when I’m binging, and I’m worried I’m going back into that place. Also to make matters worse, even though I try to stop myself, sometimes all I can get are Triple Cs, which have other chemicals that will kill your organs like nobody’s business. I take them anyway, I hate it but I can’t stop. 

I don’t want to do this anymore. I’m tired of struggling with addiction and depression and everything especially with the pandemic. I haven’t talked to another human besides the lady at the grocery store I get my drugs from, my mom, and my sister in weeks. I’m going crazy and I think I might not survive if I fall back into this. Sorry if this was too long, I just need somewhere to throw my thoughts since I can’t talk to my mom or sis without getting thrown out :/

My SO at the time was living with her parents and was unable to fulfil all of my desire for sexual contact. I started going on Tinder, then POF then Craigslist, then as my ""desperation"" grew and women get turned off by that, Grindr. After a couple years of that I got caught and quit the physical contact cold turkey and switched to retail therapy and sexual stories and message boards such can be found here on Reddit.

About a year ago my SO and I moved into an apartment and have been pretty happy living together all while I kept my online activities secret. About 6 months I got caught chatting about my previous sexual encounters with pictures included and I decided to start going to see a therapist about my addiction. Unfortunately my therapist hasn't been taking my opinion about my addiction seriously. And I've been unable to see them due to the Rona.

Most recently here on Reddit I ended up asking a Redditor to catfish my SO's best friend for her nudes and he proceeded to doxx (sp?) me using the information I gave him. This has obviously blown up my relationship especially given that every few months I get caught doing something I shouldn't be doing. 

So to my question, is there anything over the counter I can take that'll reduce or eliminate my sex drive/desire? I've been looking into herbal supplements like Scullcap and Chasteberry. And I've read that taking low dose estrogen supplements also reduce sexual desire. Please help",2

Other say that it's because of a immature mindset, without much responsibility, that someone achieve through intoxication.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 5 months now and everything has been lovely. She had mentioned a few times having tough days and urges to use again and on those days she shuts down and first of all I don't know how to help. She was going to meetings before this whole crisis but she hates video chats so she doesn't think she'd like a virtual meeting. I don't know much about her past problem, she tries hard not to tell anyone (i am one of the only people who knows, and she has a tight group of friends) So i guess question one is how can I be helpful and supportive when she is triggered?   
So she chipped her tooth a few weeks ago and all had been fine until yesterday when the pain started acting up and then today she was in an incredible amount of pain. Due to age she just got kicked off her families insurance and is now in between healthcare. SHe was going to go into the ER or UC but she would need to pay $3000 out of pocket.... so she decided she needed to wait until later this week when hopefully her work insurance would kick in. In the meantime one of her nurse family members offered to help and gave her liquid oxy to help with the pain for now (she was taking tylenol and ibprofin but it wasn't helping her). So My girlfriend asked me to hide the oxy and be the one to pour it for her. I want to help as much as I can and I am happy she made the decision to reach out to me rather than hide it or act like she could control her urges when she couldn't. I'm just terrified that I'm going to mess up or that I'm not going to say the right things. I just need advice if anyone can, please. Thank you in advance <3",3

Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."" I think about this often when trying to battle addiction. Drugs are the equivalent of giving a man a fish because they instantly give me a good feeling, but only for a small and temporary amount of time. Not doing drugs is the equivalent of teaching a man how to fish because without them I can learn how to feel good on my own, without relying on drugs.

Fighting your addiction is taking the hard path to happiness and satisfaction. But in the long run taking this path will lead to much higher levels of happiness and satisfaction that will last for a lifetime rather than a temporary period of time.

I talk about this a little in a youtube video if any of you  want to check it out.

  At this point can you even remember what it was like before? Before all of this. Back when you would wake up and the first thought that went through your mind would be about something other than putting a substance into your body? This is just you talking so you don’t have to lie. You don’t even have to answer because you already know. Do you remember the anxiety you would get watching your friends take drugs while you stayed sober? Remember how stupid they all looked and acted after taking said drugs? Remember being the sober friend? Remember being a friend? You always said it was a phase and that you would move on eventually. It’s well passed eventually. What’s it going to take to bring you back? Do you really want to come back or are you just telling yourself and everyone around you that you do to avoid facing the reality of how shitty you are? People can and will tell you over and over again that you aren’t a piece of shit but they aren’t the ones who have to live with it. Ya know, live with the things you’ve done. The things that you use as an excuse to keep using everyday. Well, those things aren’t the only excuse. You know that though. You already know everything I’m going to write down before I write it. And then some. That’s because you are me and I am you. We may not have the same addiction, the same upbringing, we may come from different backgrounds, I grew up poor as to where you may or may not have grown up wealthy but we do share one thing regardless of who we were before. We share the same story. I feel like addicts understand each other better then we allow ourselves to believe. To the overworked mother raising three kids, I know you’re stressed and tired. You work all day just to come home, cook, clean and everything in between. You feel like you’ve earned that glass of wine and a couple xanax after every night. To the crackhead who roamed the hot streets all day collecting bottles and change for 10+ hours with the sun beating on your back. You feel like you’ve earned that $10 rock. You’re two completely different people yet you share one common thing. Now I’m not gonna sit here and tell you that I know everything that there is to know about drug addiction but I will tell you one thing; I know more about it then any doctor or therapist who hasn’t dealt with it themselves. Aren’t those ones your favorite? The people that think they can help you quit even though they’ve never felt the pain of a withdrawal? They’ve never stolen from someone they loved just to get high for a few hours. They’ve never come home to an abusive spouse or parent. Yet, they think with a little rehab and help from your “Higher Power” it’s possible. But you know that to some of us it’s just not possible. A lot of us are going to die this way. It’s so crazy because you know that you want to stop more then anything but at the end of the day the voice in our head always pulls us back. It’s just too bad we aren’t strong enough to silence it. Maybe one day we will be though. At least we know people overcome this somehow almost everyday. We are in this together. Even though we don’t know each other, never heard of one another and probably never will. As addicts it’s in our nature to cling on to people like us. Which is really sad because we get to know and love these people but regardless chances are we are bound to lose them. We either watch their addiction win and they pass or one of the two of us gets sober and someone gets left behind. I don’t know about you guys but I’m fucking tired of being left behind. I just wish my addiction felt the same.

I don’t want to go into too much detail but my SO (28) has been smoking weed since he was 13/14. He’s tried countless times to give it up but each time has been unsuccessful. The biggest side effects so far have been poor sleep, terrible night sweats, and obviously cravings. He’s struggled with other substances in the past as well. He wants to make a lasting change and I want to support him as much as I can. I’m wondering what has been most helpful for those who are in his shoes? What did your loved ones or support system do for you that helped? What are some things he himself could use to battle the cravings? 

We communicate well but I think even he is unsure of how he needs support. Any and all advice is appreciated. Apologies if this is not the appropriate place for this post, if so please remove.",1

I thought I was different, that I was smarter and I wouldn't let it get a hold of me. I always told myself I had it under control, but last year it got out of hand. I hid it from everyone - my family, my partner who I live with, and managed to maintain a somewhat normal life. 

I've been on a road to recovery since January this year. It's been one of the toughest years of my life (as it has for many) and I want to fall back into bad habits so fucking badly. Every day is a struggle.

I've relapsed many times this year, but so far I'm on my longest streak - which is 39 days. Today I almost broke it a few times. I just kept staring at this app that has how many hours/days/weeks it's been since I last relapsed, and focused on how brutal it is to see that number go back to 0. I made it through. I didn't relapse. I held on.

It's fucking hard. It's lonely. Nobody knew I was an addict in the first place, so recovery has been hard. Temptation is everywhere, particularly now that I'm in isolation due to COVID-19.

So over my 2x some odd years in life. I seem to have an one point in my life encountered every drug and at one point have been addicted.

My last addiction was heroin. I ended up passing out meditating under a waterfall. In the beginning I was able to do only a few seconds as the water was to strong. Over time the pain lessened and my mind cleared. I only let the pain of the water torrenting down affect me. It was only because I let it.

As I came to my senses. I realized someone had taken my shoes. Only problem is that it was a 5 mile hike downhill. In the beginning as I stepped on loose gravel and rocks, broken twigs, sand and mud. My feet started to bleed. My blisters began to crack. I was in terrible pain.  I stopped focusing on the pain and I told myself In my mind that although In reality my feet were getting mangled going barefoot. In my mind I could control everything.

Then I got lost in the desert for 3 days. As I walked in the desert. Flies kept buzzing nonstop. In the beginning the flies bothered me and I kept thinking of them nonstop. It was until the second day I had realized I let the flies bother me. Because again I let them.

I then realized that heroin withdrawal is fucking shit. It was all in the mind. Although my physical body was in pain from withdrawal. I could still control my mind and I told myself I would never put myself through that again.

I’ve been using practices like this throughout my life to help. But I’m battling a meth addiction? I’m slightly confused myself. I don’t crave the drug nor do I have bad withdrawals. Nor do I constantly feel the urge to smoke?

So I thought. I went to rehab got out. Made it 30 days sober. I was taking my mom to a surgery. After she was admitted I broke down after watching a 50’s something couple taking care of the special needs son. I can’t explain it but something in me just snapped. I was doing great. I hit up my friend. I was excited to see her. To be sober. Get back to living life. Smoke some weed and kick it.

Than at a random McDonald’s parking lot I’m getting off to get some coffee. Suddenly I see a broke glass pipe on the floor and a little plastic baggie. Fuck I was supposed to smoke a blunt with my friend that day. Pick up my mom from surgery. Go out to dinner. Instead like wtf...

Meth addiction is different from the other types of addiction I’ve faced. It’s literally taken the joy of accomplishing anything from me. Like I no longer feel joy from completing projects or tasks. It sucks.

Not only that. Seems to be the most powerful addiction I’ve encountered... 

Usually I keep myself physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally challenged at all times. Just to keep my mind occupied. Lately with this pandemic going on I can’t go to the gym, trails are closed, tried learning how to surf which kept my mind off things for a few days.

What can I do to keep my mind occupied? Off meth.

I spent lot of time wasted doing stupid s***. Rehab is not an option at the moment. I have a 7 day window before I either start and accept a new job. Report back to my current job.

Any advice appreciated. Thanks.",2

For starters, I'm not sure if this is the right area to post this in or what, but if not, someone direct me in the right direction. Sorry if everything is sort of everywhere. TL/DR at bottom heh

(Long-ish rambling backstory)
Me and my boyfriend have been together for 3 yearsWhen we first met, though, I was no stranger to the drug world, and neither was he, but due to circumstances on his end he was pulled away from a lot of it for a few years. 
I quickly cleaned up for him, though, and so did he. All we did was smoke a little weed here and there but that was it. I was basically a dope head, about to move halfway across the country if not for him, he saw better in me and pulled me from my path of self destruction. The love is still very strong, and even stronger now because of everything we've been through, and everything we still have to go through. 
1st. Yr together around October we started using. We where strung out, bad. I'd go weeks without seeing my parents, he'd flash out on his mom and lots of family drama ensued, on both sides. We fought, argued, and broke up a handful of times, going out and hooking it up with other people. 
2nd. Year that ended quickly, when everyone in my family found out about our habits. Basically exiled, it was me and him struggling through cleaning up (no rehab). We stopped using around September. 

3rd. Year(now) 
So. I'm pregnant. And yes, I shouldnt be using while pregnant. I bash myself enough for it and am actively making an effort to stop. (I havent used in roughly a week and a half. Im just pushing into my second trimester so I'm not that far along. 

But a while ago, before around the end of February/early March we where clean. After a fight or something he was dealing with happened, he started using again. Kept it from me for a while, about a week, until he fessed up and sort of acted like nothing happened.. I was distraught, and upset. When I could just feel he had re-upped, i demanded to see, for him to set me up some to use. I say I do it so frequently when he has more because it lessens the amount he has. It reduces the number of days he stays awake. I also say I do it with him regardless of the consequences because when i was younger, the more drugs the better. If its infront of me, im going to do it. Sometimes i dont want to, but i do it anyway, I've called it something like the pull of a previous addiction can never be put to rest because the body always craves the high. It could apply to a cigarette for me. I dont like to call myself weak, but i am getting firmer with telling myself no. Im proud(:

I talked with him about him needing to stop or at least slow down so quitting will be easier, but to no avail, it was going no where it felt. He kept telling me things like, ""I'm not an addict, I can stop anytime I want."" Or, ""I only use it when I'm at work, its like my coffee."" And one that's really stuck with me is, ""Well you dont have to do any...it's my money... If i want some I'll get it regardless."" He stopped for a bit, and I'm saying that while holding onto every bit of truth I hope he gave me. Within the past month he started working offshore again. Gone for about a week, home for a day or two. No drug tests on the job so numerous types of drugs make their way through the industry, its sort of unavoidable but it's what we're doing to make money right now because of Covid-19 halting everything in society right now. We have a house to pay for and a future child to support. Anywho, one of oh-so lovely men that he works with is literally the person D.A.R.E tells you to run from. Lost his family to drugs, and is the kind of evil that finds satisfaction in knowing he has the power to begin or fuel someones addiction. My fiance is very strong willed but will succumb if drugs are involved... Within these work trips his behavior has become more erratic and very similar to how he acted when he was using all the time. Access to the drug at work where he can use it basically whenever is not good, but the money is crucial right now...

(GUYS IM SO SORRY THIS IS LONG)

I have resorted to (crazy gf yea ik) deleting his connects numbers from his phone, making me send him his location to prove he's not at the spots. I've forced my way into every possible situation in which he has to leave the house, that I go with him. I've sat him down and simply explained my feelings, to eventually crying and begging for him to stop with me, on multiple occasions. One point when I had my hands on a couple ten panel drug tests, i threatened to drug test him every time he came home from his work trips. Said he doesn't care, what am i gonna do with the information with the test anyway? He's become very snarky and quick to agitate, he was already hot headed enough.. 

But there are times where he comes down and he says he hates doing it, he wants to quit but he just doesn't feel himself without it. He has broken down crying in my arms before about wanting to stop.. i understand where hes coming from, i was addicted to this, and more.
This baby in my stomach was reason enough for me to stop. I just thought it would be his too.. 

TL:DR/ Me and my boyfriend have been frequent users in the past and recently finding out he has continued usage has severaly impacted the relationship due to me being pregnant. Tensions rising as he seems to make no attempt to quit but I cant give up on him, because he didnt give up on me not once. How to I get him to see the light??",22
2020-05-01 13:02:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/gblwsp/concerned_about_bf_cocaine_abuse/,Concerned about bf cocaine abuse,"First off my apologies if this is in the wrong place but I’m really concerned about my boyfriend. He’s struggled with alcoholism for a long time and he’s suffered major consequences for that. However a year ago he started secretly using cocaine daily. He went out of his way to hide this from me but he got worse at hiding it the more he did. I started to key in and notice his nose was constantly plugged and I would find crusty bloody tissues hidden. Gross I know. He also started not sleeping and barely eating. After a few months of this he had to face his legal issues for his drinking and had no choice but to quit the cocaine use at that time. Which again he still hasn’t admitted to but I noticed a substantial change in his behavior when I knew there was no way he was using (court ordered drug tests and jail time) now fast forward to this year I’m starting to see some crazy changes in behavior again. Starting in December I found a large bag of blow hidden in in clothes, I threw it away and waited to see if he’d come clean. He instead told me that was for his friend and for mad because I just threw away all his friends money. Obviously I didn’t buy that but I just kept waiting to see what else would happen. His behaviors starting getting erratic again but he blamed it on not having his meds for sleeping/mood disorder which when he’s on those meds he acts normal but when off he acts erratic kinda like when on cocaine so it’s hard to tell. In February I find another very large bag of blow hidden. This time I confront him and he says he had to try it for a friend but was giving it back to the friend so his friend could sell it and know it was good. Again didn’t buy it. His behavior has only gotten worse he goes on long intense tangents about his hatred from the government and listens to the same obnoxious music over and over usually the content is about using heroin or cocaine. He stays up until 6 am almost everyday then sleeps until 3. A few weeks ago he must of gotten sloppy and I went in his bathroom unexpectedly and there was the leftovers of 3 giant lines and rolled up paper. This time I lost it I demanded he come over and tell me what he was. He said it was baby powder. I put some on my tongue and sure as shit cocaine. He then came up with a plethora of excuses and was mad at me ultimately. His behavior now hasn’t changed much but of course he’s out of his “mood medicine” and I’m afraid I’m just way too paranoid now but I find small residue amounts of powder everywhere. I guess my question is am I being paranoid now because of everything I’ve gone through or is he still using and just better at hiding? I’ve never dealt with this before all of the hiding spots I’ve found he won’t use anymore so I’m not versed in how to handle is extra sneaky behavior now. I know his nose is constantly fucked up. He can barely breathe and I find every brand you can think of saline sprays in his bathroom and car. He has no history of allergies or sinus issues. Sorry for this rambling but I have nobody I can explain my situation to or maybe get advice on how to catch him so I can start the process of getting him help. I feel like there’s too much paranoia on my end, feeling bad for him because he does need meds and ultimately I need an outsiders perspective on how to proceed. Sorry I would’ve posted in the cocaine sub but it didn’t seem like the right place and if this isn’t he right place please direct me to the correct sub. Thanks to anyone who read this!",12

When I started using I had the world, I had girls, no one would bullie me, no one would ridicule me, no one dared too even get close to me. I fucking love it. Thats what I want too be, always and forever. 

The drugs stopped working, the party is over, Im alone, I use 24/7 weed, it doesnt work anymore, but I have too use or else I start having really dark thoughts. About killing myself mostly. About why I was the center of attention when I drink and why I cant be like that sober. Being drunk almost felt like controlling magic powers. Doesnt matter what I want, when Im drunk, I will get it.

Sober? I cant even walk too the supermarkt without standing 1 hour in front of my mirror, because I gotta look perfect when I go outside. The weed makes it much worse too. 

How can you ever live with your weak self? When the strong one gave you everything you ever wanted and deserved. Why do they like me when I drink and not when Im sober? This is no post about me wanting too drink, because I dont. 

I just dont get what alcohol can do to my brain, that NOTHING in this world can ever reach.
