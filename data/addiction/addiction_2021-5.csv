I’m a male 21 years old. On the outside I guess I’m a fairly ‘high-value’ guy. Over 6 foot, pretty good looking, dress nice and work in the fashion industry. Socially I think I’m actually very good with talking to people, I have a good circle of friends and never had too much trouble getting girls. Definitely not a player or anything like that but I get dates and hook ups here and there throughout a given year and have had a few real girlfriend/relationships.

However I have an addiction I’m embarrassed about and that is getting happy ending massages. I live in a city where there are parlours absolutely everywhere that offer these services, from little dodgy places where you can get a cheap back massage and a hand job from a middle aged Asian or Russian lady all the way to places where you can pay a bit more and have full on sex with 10 on 10 woman my age.

Over the past few years I’ve been going to these places in their various forms dozens of times. It’s an addiction I can’t seem to break, it’s like I physically need to go every month. If I don’t I start to get shaky and tense and anxious. I know this sounds insane but it’s true. I have an almost physical dependency. If I go a while without masterbating or having sex (with a normal real life girl I might be seeing) then the urge increases and becomes unbearable.

I guess to some this isn’t that bad of an addiction but to me I feel like financial cost is not something I can really justifiably afford. Maybe when I’m better off financially I can keep this addiction going but right now I feel like there’s no way I can really justify paying 100$ or so a month on these services. Furthermore I hate the fact of being addicted to something , regardless of what it is.

Maybe this is inappropriate for this sub but does anyone have any advice on how to break it? Is this something I should even be trying to break or is it a healthy addiction ?",1,0

All I crave is the instant rush of dopamine and other feel-good neurotransmitters. I'm addicted to alcohol, cigarettes, weed, food, porn, the stock market, you name it. I never moderate when it comes to anything and I am impulsive as can be. I'm aware that there is such a thing as neuroplasticity and if I could just focus on other things besides all of my addictions and go cold turkey for long enough, my brain would start changing and reorganizing for the better. But I've never been able to stay sober, keep from overeating, maintain abstinence from porn, or make smart investments in / not obsess over the stock market (the one opportunity I had out of pure luck I got greedy, fell into the ""hold don't sell"" cult-mentality, and lost it all). I hate my stupid, monkey-brain.

I'm 27, a college dropout who still lives at home, and still a virgin (fully aware porn has been a huge barrier keeping me from being the man I want / need to be). I hate myself and am constantly ashamed and guilty about my behavior, causing me to punish myself for it for over a decade now. When I'm sober I don't know what to do, I hate my job, and I believe I suffer from avoidant personality disorder. I'm so lost and hopeless for my future. I just want a redo so I could implement all the things I know now into my life before I let my addictions run rampant so it would've turned out better. I feel trapped and like I'm quickly fading away.",71,0

Or was.. I love her to pieces. She is my only sibling and currently in active addiction. She became addicted to meth prior to becoming an adult and is currently 27 years old. She was in recovery for 4 years before reconnecting with an old boyfriend fresh out of addiction. It wasn't long before she spun out of control, lost her job, home, and current visitation with her daughter. She hasn't spoken to me for almost a year, spawing from me calling her on it. Our mom recently contracted Covid and her near death and hospitalization has reconnected us all. It has been amazing to hear from my sister. I am so happy to be able to check in and know she's alive. She's living with no electricity or water, in a house for free. I'm not really sure what the deal is with her not needing to pay rent and I figured if she wanted me to know, she'd tell me. 
My sister messaged me today asking for 4 dollars. She said her allergies are killing her and she needs meds. I told her that I love her, and without judgement I'm going to decline. I told her I will be happy to use my resources to get her in rehab once again, where she will have her needs met. I was instrumental in her deciding to go the first time. It took her almost a year of dual treatment to get her mind back out of a psychotic episode. She's not gotten that bad this time as far as I know, but I feel like any help she gets from me is another step in the wrong direction. Shes currently facing charges for stealing a ton of my mom's property. Anything from a lawn mower to dog houses,, to old bicycles. Generally items you wouldn't think are worth anything. She also stole a necklace from her 8 year old daughter, that I had bought her for her birthday. It was hard to say no because I'm so afraid she's going to run again. I hate not knowing. But I strongly believe the more help she gets from family, the longer she can sustain her current lifestyle. 
Was I wrong to say no to 4 dollars?? She's pissed and asked me if I really thought she could score with 4 dollars. I just told her I love her and I'm sorry to hurt her feelings, and I hope she feels better soon.",2,1

The pain medication is marijuana. I don't use other drugs because of the side effects. I am afraid that continued abuse of NSAIDs and the use of opiates in general will simply lower my life span and possibly cause worse addiction. Opiates have never helped my arthritis pain anyway, only NSAIDs marijuana. Since the marijuana is not physically addictive I actually have no problem stopping at at all other than the terrible effect it has on my mood and how mean and abusive I am to the people around me. It's so bad I was even banned from Facebook for 30 days for bullying. Don't feel bad for the bully, I'm just ranting...probably something else I need to stop doing. Anyways I'm sitting here perfectly fine and happy without a craving in the world because those don't happen with marijuana but I know I'm going to smoke later on because I don't want to end up yelling at my family so I will dread my sobriety until I hit that pipe until then you guys be stronger than me.",1,0

How do we get anywhere close to what we used to feel (either the calm of the down of the satisfaction of the high)? I'm really struggling. 

Aside from general problem areas, I already have bipolar disorder which definitely exacerbates things. I'm definitely hypersexual in no small part because of that, and also just a general enthusiasm for the project of making people infatuated with me and having more intense sex (enthusiastically consensual) that makes interactions with even my best friends feel hollow, and 'healthy' sex feel numbing. Mild stimulants help but they also make me want to go do better stimulants and ride that energy out on someone.

I take my meds and go to therapy and right now I'm working on the conversation around journaling anything that I feel good doing that isn't illegal, dangerous or entirely just a distraction. We ackowledge distraction is a critical part of this sometimes, but it does tend to get a bit frustrating eventually.

So I used to have problems with alcohol and cocaine, as they go hand in hand. The rampant coke use went on for about two years, and the alcohol maybe four years or so. Both were extreme problems in my life. My entire family has struggled with addiction so I wasn’t surprised that it happened. The weird thing is, when I stopped, I just kind of... stopped. I hadn’t actually made a concrete decision to stop using either substance, eventually I just didn’t want them anymore. That’s not my question however. A couple times since I stopped the coke (4 years ago) I’ve tried to do it again, and it’s been the worst thing ever. I didn’t feel a modicum of pleasure from it, it made me feel awful and anxious. The same goes for alcohol, except I handle it a little better. I have one drink maybe ten different days a year, but anything past that just makes me feel awful. 

So my question is, is it normal for substances to become borderline unbearable after one has recovered from addiction? Was I ever truly addicted in the first place? My concern is that maybe I have some kind of health problem that either of those substances exacerbate. I’ve been to the doctor recently, and the only problem I found was borderline high cholesterol, and I’m also underweight. (5’9”, 118lbs) In addition, I’ve noticed the same thing with psychedelics, although I never considered myself addicted, they’re just much harder to do now. I figure that’s a little bit more normal, but I’m only 22 at the same time.

My biggest concern posting this is that I might create some kind of hope that addiction will wither away without a concentrated effort for someone. I don’t know why that happened to me and I know it has to be extremely uncommon. If anyone knows about this or can direct me to the proper place to answer the question, I would be super grateful.",1,0

I was prescribed 30mg IR twice a day. But I would finish my bottle within 10-14 days. I remember sometimes taking 80-120mg at once and just zoning out. The most I took in a day was 180mg. I honestly don’t know how I’m alive, it got really bad. Before adderall the only thing I did drug wise was smoking weed, which I still do. I would go 3-4 nights without sleeping. Then once my bottle was done, I would sleep like 20 hours a day until I got another script. It was so bad. No food for 3-4 days.

last night i had prom, i finished school on wednesday. the actual event was a bit dead but everyone went to the park to get drunk after it ended. i'd been drinking wine for most of the prom (half 4 to half 6), when we were walking to the park i had a bottle of wkd and then another bottle of wine when we got there. i'm 16m but i'm pretty small for my age and i didn't eat much before i drank so i got pissed really fast.

part of the reason i went is because my dealer (i'll call him isaac) was there and i was picking up ket from him. i was sitting with a few friends (michael, evie and a few others) but got up and walked off to go find isaac and get my ket. my friends all knew i was picking up and when i got back they told me they weren't gonna let me do any of it that night because i was so pissed. i remember telling them i'd be fine, i've oded before and apparently i'm invinvible. they weren't having any of that and because i was wandering around and they weren't with me they thought i'd taken some of it and michael (who was pretty much sober) took the baggie off me. one thing i remember in particular is michael telling me that a couple days before this isaac told him and a few other mutual friends that he was seriously worried about my drug use.

i don't remember anything after that so the rest of this is just from what people have told me. i kept passing out/falling asleep in michael's lap so they all got worried and decided to take me back to evie's house as she lived the closest. at this point i was too gone to walk so michael and some girls from my school were pretty much carrying me. a girl i'll call sabiha used my phone to call my parents and put it in her bag and then after that we all thought i'd lost it as the others weren't sober either. when we got to evie's they were trying to make me drink water and eat but i was refusing and wouldn't shut up about my phone. my dad came to pick me up and while i was getting into the car sabiha ran up to me and gave my phone back.

my parents were understandably pissed off after that so at the moment i'm grounded and my dad's taken my phone. looking back at last night it was fucking hilarious but i've also been thinking a lot about it.

i know i have a problem with ket but i think i've got a serious addiction to anything that makes me not sober. you can tell from this post that i'm very reckless with my safety and stuff, to the point where my dealer told my friends behind my back that he was worried. if my friends hadn't been there to stop me i definitely would've taken that ket and gone completely overboard and ended up in hospital or worse.

i've known for months that i badly need to pattern my drug use, especially after i got caught fucked at school with a baggie with 20 vals in my uniform. my parents and social workers know about my drug use and agree. i don't know how to stop though. i've got ambitions and i know what i'm gonna do in life but at the same time i can't imagine myself being completely sober from substances. when i was 13-14 i would drink and do ket in school and when i didn't have access to them i'd sniff tippex and glue. and now whenever i get access to anything i go completely over the top and put myself in danger.

i know that i have a problem and i need to start caring before something bad happens to me but it's impossible. my friends are all relatively responsible and i've got completely different standards of safety compared to them because i'm so reckless. i don't know how to start caring about myself and sometimes i get scared this is gonna kill me soon but i just don't care and it's really frustrating.

I'm 11 months sober from alcohol and around 10 from other substances. I'm doing my steps and all that good stuff and it's going well. I still think I've shifted my addictions though to food and other things that aren't good for me and deep down and for long term goals I don't wanna be doing. 
It's like I've got to the point where I've realised this and am aware I'm making a conscious choice when I sabotage my progress cos it doesn't make sense and I can't and won't blame it on anything. 
I'm just deciding to do something I know I don't wanna do. 
There's always this 'after this I'll stop doing it' mentality and I know it's bullshit yet it's always there. 
I just can't seem to understand or overcome that. I just keep making these decisions that my higher self doesn't really want me to make. Self sabotage. 
Is there any literature or good explanations out there why we fuckin do this shit? Anything that anybodys ever come across that's snapped em out of it?

I got into it and out of it at a very young age.

Over the span of a few months I went from abusing cough medicine once a week or less, to 3+ times a week, eventually daily, and then went onto harder drugs.

As a student, I quickly and easily gained access to a variety of prescription drugs, particularly Adderall, Ritalin, and Xanax.

Not long til I was using cocaine and MDMA.

Time went on and the addictions got worse and worse.

I couldn't hold down a relationship for more than a couple months

I was super manipulative and constantly lied about my use.

I was high everyday and could hide it when I chose to or had to do so 

unless I was completely obliterated

From January to March of 2018, I  was on a serious Adderall/Coke/Xanax bender, 

no days, off I'd go into debt with drug dealers from time to time but between fraud, theft, and selling drugs, managed to pay off my debts just in time to get more.

Paranoid out of my tree, I thought I had it all figured out.

While on an overload of stimulants I was doing considerably well in school which helped me hide my drug use.

I was in a mild to moderate psychosis most of the time, thinking people were out to get me.

I'd draw arrows all over my school work, each pointing to a detailed analysis of every little detail.

When the paranoia was too bad, I'd turn the stimulants down a bit and crank up the Xanax.

Toxic chaos aside, this worked in my favour for the most part, until the one day that changed the direction of my life forever.

I came home after class and my mom was fuming. She'd gone through my belongings and found an empty bottle of Captain Morgan, a variety of used blister packets, some miscellaneous powders and a bit of weed.

I was 16mg deep in xanax that afternoon and I backed out after that. All I remember is going upstairs.

My next memory is in waking up in the hospital.

The nurse told me I was brought it by ambulance.

After a few weeks of fighting with my family and still using here and there, I realized I was ruining my life.

No one in my family trusted me because I lied to them all the time.

I had almost no meaningful connections with the exception of a few friends.

I hurt people constantly and it didn't seem to bother me for a very long time.

I had caused others to develop serious addictions.

I realized the only thing I was ever committed to and passionate about was drugs.

I realized I needed to get help.

I went rehab and my life began to change

fI got involved with many different groups while in rehab, CA being my favorite.

In the beginning, CA helped me a lot

I might not be where I am today if it weren't for Cocaine Anonymous

But things started to get kind of weird

I felt like I wasn't being myself

I'm agnostic and I was doing things that weren't genuinely in line with my beliefs

I'd pray and wouldn't believe my own prayers

I would do things simply because it's what my sponsor said

It gave me a slightly unrealistic outlook on life

I began to demonize alcohol and other drugs

I was against taking any sort of medicine for a long time

I've had insomnia issues since I was really young and this made matters worse

I was unwilling to seek medical advice because I was so against taking any kind of medication

Despite hardly sleeping, having frequent difficulty falling asleep and inability to stay asleep.

If I held onto this belief, I was on the fast track brain damage and many other health issues.

Just recently I started seeking help for my insomnia.

And I have no desire to abuse any sort of sleeping medications, it's purely for my mental and physical health.

I'll touch on that more in another episode, but

Hands down CA helped me develop a better set of morals, but that's about it

If you do something bad or hurt someone, you should probably apologize

If someone has wronged you, don't hold onto it for too long.

Stuff like that.

But as time went on, I realized I was just going through the motions

Everyone seemed to rant on about God all the time to the extent it seemed almost unhealthy.

I couldn't relate.

Some seemed like genuinely good people, which kept me coming back.

But I knew I'd never be on the same wavelength with those people.

Our beliefs we just too different.

Nevertheless, I learned a lot about being a good person.

Don't lie to people, and they will trust you.

Don't commit felonies and you won't end up in jail

Don't abuse drugs and alcohol and you've got a shot at a decent life.

The basics.

To this day I have no desire to ever abuse drugs or alcohol again.

I can't imagine what my life would be like if I did.

I have a decent job, I have strong, healthy relationships, and I'm not worried about people being out to get me.

I'm grateful for what I've learned,

But a wise man told me that when it comes to advice,

To take what I need and leave the rest.

With that, I hope you guys are a little smarter than last time and I'll see you again next week!

If you are too, just know someone else understands.","I came to Portland  4 years ago to get off of pills and use my natural medicines in peace. Its been such a crazy journey here. I've met God, seen a milli, finally learned how it felt to be treated with the love I now know I deserve. I finally felt the sun kiss my skin, the smell of fresh air, the taste of water that I had been blinded from by my environment and xanax that I had never known before. I finally felt loved.

I recently ran into so some trouble that caused me to relapse really hard. I blacked out for 2 weeks and my brother and father in law had to come wake me up. Had a seizure trying to cold turkey. And I realized it was time to go see my mom. This journey of life is very fucking weird, and sometimes you've learned what you needed to out of a certain place or thing or person. Sometimes you need to move on.

I'm struggling really hard right now not to give in to my cravings to just turn off my brain and forget about packing up this beautiful life I've created for myself here. But I know now that I am loved, and that if I remember that I don't need the pills. They are just a distraction. I can do this. And it will be okay. More than okay, it will be good.

You can do this to. I promise. You are more loved than you know. Don't forget that when you want to pick up. Pick up a phone and call a friend or a hotline or eat some mushrooms (psychedelic or not, Google cordyceps and lions mane they make me feel amazing and get rid of my cravings and depression, another awesome gift I've learned here).

She just doesn’t get it. She keeps saying how counselors can still help even if they haven’t “walked in my shoes,” and she doesn’t seem to understand why I want to work with someone who is in recovery.

Started off with pit and alcohol then after my 3rd son was born I got into opioids. I did a outpatient IOP and when my days were done I picked up weed as soon as I could and the cycle continued for 3 months. My mom knew something was up right away and got me back in rehab inpatient for 5 weeks. This was 2015

I have done pills a couple times since then, but always stopped on my own. Now I have been addicted to ADHD meds and caffeine for 2 years. 

I hate myself and the person I have become. My tollance to ADHD meds is sky rocket so my script only lasts maybe a week.it has also gotten to the point I am not productive either. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 5. Medicated all through school. I know it's not all in my head. I really do suffer with doing every day tasks. 

I tried non stimulant medicine, but it doesn't work. 

Here I am 33 years old, mom to 3 boys. And totally lost in life. I abuse caffeine as well because if I don't I could seriously sleep all day. My just one engery shot, 5 hour, use to keep me up all night. Now I can take 3 and go to sleep. 

No one knows I am struggling but me and the devil himself. My mental health has gone to shit. Depression and anxiety. My entire house is a shit show. I can't seem to get it cleaned up. Mainly because I don't have the energy or focus to do it. Dirty dishes take over my kitchen. no dishwasher so I hate washing. I got behind one week and am now going on a month trying to catch up. 

Laundry is bad, floor needs mopped, everything is a. Shit. Show. But here I am, I got everything under control right? No. I seriously can't go back to rehab. My husband is 18 years older than me, he can't watch my kids. I can't tell my mom because I will just break her heart again. I don't want to watch her cry again knowing I fucked up again. 

My kids sure as hell don't deserve this. I am the scum of the earth. I take care of them and love them to death, but I am failing them. They have no idea how shitty their mom is.

Everything just seems worthless and I hate myself so much for having zero interest in anything. I've isolated myself from friends and slowly giving up on all my hobbies. My focus and attention span got very decreased and I'm getting irritated on pretty ridiculous things. Now been on codeine for almost two months everyday and stopping it seems really hard and not ever worth it. I feel I'd rather just waste on it the rest of my money and yeet head down from some roof. (to precisise: yep, I've earned those money, I've been tutoring, but currently it ended) I know getting yourself into addiction in that age must have pretty significant impact on the brain and personality developement. I fear I'd be returning to this anyway, I won't be able to deal with regular, real life situations any other way. And I know I'm just boring person who has nothing to offer, I've been like that since I remember. Also shy and socially awkward af. Now it all only deepen. I have no life goals, nothing to follow, no ambitions, null. Family doesn't know anything, mom just had noticed that I seem a little depressed and started making suicide jokes of me, which doesn't help. If I told her, she would most probably just get mad af, and then get like ""well that's your life, you fucked it, now deal with that"" which is pretty true, but also doesn't help. I so much want to end it the quickest and ""easiest"" way we all know. That's why I've got here, seeking for some hope. Have anyone even fully recovered from addiction started at that age or sooner?

Ever since i got my period at age 12 i stared eating painkillers, pretty quickly it started to escalate, i ate a map a day. (I'm quite small as well)
I had to stop eating them multiple times because they didn't even give me any effect anymore.

When I started working i was back at it, work had terrible bad manigement and i was living on painkillers (5000-7000mg/day), very much caffeine and wors the alcohol. A lot of it. I kept this up for 2,5 years untill I got burnt out. I crashed hard, lost my hole balance, and my arm's wouldn't work at all. I went to the doctor checked my liver, surprise, it was in perfekt condition. 

So here I am 1,5 years later, stared studying, and I'm a bit stressed and i had a headache but was going on out with some friends for a beer and i took to pills and got drunk, took another one when I got home.  A few days later i did it agent, took pills and alkohol. And now I'm back at the habit of taking pills to get energi so i can get things done. I LOVE IT. That energi when u feel no pain is amazing.

Have a question.,"I quit Adderall 3 weeks ago and could use some input from anyone else who was on it for a while and quit. I was on 70 mgs a day (1 30 XR and 2 20 IRs daily) for a little over a decade.  I have noticed something lately that I hope will go away... Let me try to explain. I feel like there is a knot of anxiety in my stomache throughout the day. Normally, this would make sense because of all of the amp I was on.. But I feel like it is even moreso after quitting and it makes no sense because I thought I was eliminating something from my life that gave me more anxiety. What I want to ask you folks is two fold... Did you experience this as well? If so, how long after quitting should I expect this anxiety?

I noticed how much money I was wasting on weed, I started when I was around 15 to kill the stress of highschool and my stupid brothers always getting me in trouble but I have been able to kick weed a few times over the years (pee tests for jobs ect.) Now my issue is that my time stretches out much longer. I got sober so I could start saving up and to get in better shape. The weed was easy...the porn? Not so much. It's not that I NEED to watch it but like I said there is no relief out here for a single guy with no prospects but idk it just reaalllly sucks. Everything sucks right now but I knew it would at first. I was so tired of post-nut clarity. I am a grown man, I have needs, but in all honesty porn starts to be less and less effective and only makes me sad. I see all these gorgeous women and it just makes me feel like a huge loser that I have to watch them to get off because I live in a shitty town with pretty much no dating options. I stopped because I was tired of feeling worse, I have seen pretty much everything and honestly it does not do the job anymore regardless of who or what I watch. My rock-bottom was when looked up and realized I was searching up girls that looked like my ex...that's when I knew things were bad. I feel like weening myself off is good for my mental but it is definitely easier to give up weed imo idk if anybody else is struggling with something similar but I am trying my best here, it hurts but I feel like I am taking back control of my life and my wallet.",43,0

Told my psych, she took me off of it cold turkey and thats when the cravings for drugs began. I went 3 weeks fully sober and hated it, and then I got my hands on adderall through a friend and abused the shit out of it.

The anxiety from the adderall and the feelings of impulsiveness and cravings led me to start stealing my dads oxycodone and klonopin (which he doesn't need anymore because he heavily cut back his dosages). Then i convinced my psych to put me on adderall 10 mg, which of course I then abused and took all 160 mg over 3 days.

I was using alcohol, oxycodone, and/or klonopin to come down off the adderall or to numb things when I had no adderall. 

I flushed pills multiple times but kept coming back, until today. I wrote everything in my notes on my phone regarding what I've done and abused over the past 2 months. I sent it to my brother and asked him to make Sure I say it to my parents. I found an outpatient rehab that I will be calling tomorrow and I will be attending Narcotics Anonymous starting as soon as possible. 

I am discontinuing my adderall prescription as well. I am filled with shame, regret, and disappointment, but I am accepting that I do not have control over this and I need help from addiction programs. 

I am not physically addicted to anything and my abuse has only gone as far as adderall and oxycodone. I actually don't enjoy opioids at all, I don't get any euphoria from them. They feel like I took a Benadryl.

A&B usually pick up drugs together and do them together multiple times a week.  Person B has the drug dealers number on their phone and contacts him before they go pick up together. Person A one day really wants to do drugs and asks person B are you going to do any today. Person B says No I'm trying not to. 

A then asks B for the drug dealers number in which she replies No I'm not giving it to you because she doesn't want A to do drugs. After a few seconds of A asking why won't you just give it to me I'll go get it on my own B says fuck it let's just do drugs. 

A&B both go to meet the drug dealer and they pick up a gran of MDMA. B is holding onto the drugs. After they get the drugs A asks the drug dealer if he can have his number. After hearing this B says ""Just come on"" and starts walking away with the drugs. A says to her hold on a second and proceeds to put the number in his phone.


After A has put the number in his phone, B who kept walking away and didn't stop is nowhere to be seen. A calls B and asks her where she is (it's 3am and she just walked away on her own). B gets angry and she says she doesn't want anything to do with him right now because even though she didn't want to give him the number because she didn't want him doing drugs he undermined her and asked for the number anyways. She also said that when she walked away he chose the drug dealers number over coming after her. A says that is not fair and that she should come meet up with him so that they can go home. She says Nope Nope Nope No way and hangs up the phone. A then goes to a cornerstone right outside the dealers apartment and says I'm waiting for you out here and I'll be here waiting for you. B says No I don't want to see you and refuses to give A her location. A tries calling her multiple times and she says the same thing and hangs up over and over. She says that A is completely wrong and he undermined her and also chose the Drug dealers number over her so she wants nothing to do with him. A repeatedly tells her to come meet up with him or tell him where she is so that they can go home. A tells her he is going to stay at the cornerstone until she gets there. He waits there for 2 hours and she doesn't come. She repeatedly says that he undermined her and chose the number over her and that he should apologize. A upset about her walking away and refusing to meet up with him refuses to apologize because he felt nothing wrong. He tells her that he will continue to wait for her and that they should meet up and go home. B refuses and says ""No what you did this time is not ok"" and refuses to meet up with him.

72,2021-05-26 02:06:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nl9tq8/cell_phone_addiction_concerns/,Cell Phone Addiction Concerns,"The lockdown has made it very  difficult for us to reduce our screen timings. It is a cause of concern not only for our eyes but also for our brains. It is very difficult to identify triggers on the cell phone because there is a constant flux of information that you cannot block or stop from coming. This is a major issue that everyone has been facing. 

To be honest it had been something similar even before this because we were always on our phones. From dinner tables to washroom they're our one true friend. However, let's be honest here : there have been times when you only wish to throw it away. For those of us who have anger management issues throwing away your phone at every trigger is an expensive reality and to fix the phone, you look for a better screen or stronger cover, now all of this is easily available be in on Shopify or a [Shopify alternative](https://www.truegether.com/category/cell-phones). However, it's not for all of us. Not everyone can afford throwing away their phones in anger .


For those of us who have been facing issues with smartphone addiction, this is a really difficult time. This is something that people should open about more often. However, the reason why it escapes attention is how imperceptibly pernicious it has been. Let's talk about our own obsession with mobile phones and its [accessories](https://www.truegether.com/category/cell-phones). There are so many things that go into the making of how your phone should exactly look from the outside. Several of us even customize it inside with our favourite wallpaper and fonts. All of these signify how important an artefact cell phones have become in our lives. 

When it comes to identifying the problem it is still comparatively harder than solving it. For it you need to ask yourself three questions. How long can you go without using your phone ? What exactly are you doing on your phone ? and lastly, have you been ignoring people around you because of your phone ?

If your answer to the two of these questions is a yes , then there is a need for you to check if you have been addicted to your phone. However, please understand here that being addicted to your phone has different connotations especially in the time of the lockdown. This being said, a lot of your energy being set on your phone can induce exhaustion and brain burn out. This is also linked to toxic work and school culture. 

The thing we need to realize today is that nothing matters more to us than  the health of our loved ones. However, we must intake the stock that here the idea of 'health' means both physical as well as mental. Don't make cell phone a coping mechanism, it will mess up with your sleep cycle, induce anxiety and lead to brain burn outs with zero percent of any sort of productive work being done. If you see yourself falling in this dark pit of anyone you know, identify it and help yourself or someone else come out of it.",0,2
73,2021-05-26 01:33:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nl9b4m/vr_addiction_ruined_my_relationship/,VR addiction ruined my relationship,"I'm not the one with the addiction, my now-ex-fiancée is. We met back in high school and got connected online so we could play games together. It was a pretty good time, and while I vanished from the internet for a time when I joined the military, she was still hanging around when I had time to be online again. She was still my friend, still a trustworthy person, at least that was my impression. After a while, I bought a house and, since she was one of my oldest and closest friends, I invited her to come live with me. She accepted and it was a good time.

We lasted all of 8 days before confessing our attraction for one another, and were going strong for 3 months before I introduced her to a particular social VR game. She already had a headset which I had lent her an amount for and was just starting a job at the time. She enjoyed it a bit more than I did. She started spending a bit less time around our Discord since voice-comms are a thing in this game, and when January rolled around, she was spending most of her gaming time in VR. She was always a gamer, mind you, but something seemed to be changing, as she'd abandoned a game she'd consistently at least logged into over for about the entire 6+ years I'd known her.

Anyway, January comes and I have a temporary duty assignment that they say can't be done virtually unless the 200-mile distance from my fiancée would cause hardship. It's close enough for me to come home on the weekends, so I do. Each weekend, she seems to have gotten more and more commited to this game and by the time I'm done with my month-ish duty assignment, she's spending easily 14 hours a day in-game, as she's sleeping in VR as well as spending all of her available free time in it. She also spent $1000+ on body tracking while still owing me for the headset and a few other things, so there's that.

It's May now, and there are a few things: she emotionally cheated on me in VR, got hypnotised twice without my consent in VR, snuggled mass amounts of people, and consistently logged hours on the daily, not taking a day off since February 15th. She was my best (and to some extent only) friend, and she did all of this. Any time I'd ask her to take a day off, she'd either noncommitally brush it off or accuse me of being controlling.

After we broke up, since she's so far from home and doesn't have a place to go, she stayed here. Foolish me thought that now would be a good time to try to break her of her addiction (I know, she has to see it as a problem. I was in significant grief and not thinking clearly.), so I put a time restriction on the router: no ethernet for either of us after 2:30 AM. This was done after I asked what time she'd go to bed, and even the thought of it had her breaking down for the hour before 2:30 hit, and then having a panic attack and withdrawal symptoms.

I don't know what to do. She's still in my house because we still have a contract binding us, but I find it nearly impossible to sleep knowing that she's off doing whatever or sleeping with whoever while just reinforcing her habit. I agreed to not cut the internet in exchange for her cutting contact with one of the more egregious offenders with whom she cheated on me. I just want my friend back.",2,0

I am a chronic relapser and this is by far the most difficult time I have had in early sobriety. Thankfully I have no cravings really, but depression and anxiety and insomnia are trying their best to kill me. I am going through bouts of absolute fucking rage for no reason, followed by bouts of crying to stupid shit like Taylor Swift songs. My girlfriend of 15 years is very hurt by my addiction because I am a piece of shit when I am using, so putting things back together with her has been brutal. We have two amazing kids together, we own a house together, we own vehicles together, and she is without a doubt the love of my life. Knowing how much I have hurt her is killing me. She’s not being shy about her resentments and disgust with me. I need to accept that two weeks clean isn’t going to fix 15 years of pure fucking chaos that I have created while she tried and fights to keep our lives as normal as possible. But even though I understand her hurt, my addicted and selfish brain still lets me get hurt when she doesn’t want me to hug her or kiss her. And then I get mad and act like a jackass when I am in the wrong. I know time and sobriety will fix it but fuck man, I am an open wound and I thought she would be loving and supportive in my early recovery.

His diet consists of chips, pizza, pop, basically everything you’d have at a kids birthday party. Gradually over time his foods of choice have become more and more selective to the point where he only eats specific brands because of how he perceives them. This has gone on for years and has always been a point of contention between him and his family.

In high school he struggled tremendously with the social aspect and the academic side of it at the same time and it led to him eventually dropping out in grade 10 to be “homeschooled”, he never finished his homeschooling if you could even call it that to begin with. In high school he picked up the habit of smoking weed and it’s only made him further apathetic and escape into a world of playing video games from sun up to sun down and moving as little as possible from his bed.

For context, his father is a stern man who is a carpenter by trade and a very active guy in general, but he has a tendency to be too harsh with him. On the other hand his mother is an enabler who has allowed his behaviour to continue throughout his life and consistently defends him from any criticism.

He is halfway through being 20, he had a job and worked the first day, skipped the second day, and quit on the 3rd day. It was simple manual labor cutting lawns for $18/hr for a local rich guy, but he couldn’t handle it he said he felt like throwing up constantly and hated every second of it. Now he has fallen back into his habit of doing nothing but playing video games all day and smoking weed and any attempts to help him have been resisted and he gets mean to everyone around him. 

This has been going on for years now and I simply don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve taken him to parties to socialize, introduced him to countless people, got him set up on tinder and talking to women, introduced him to women in general, drove him around to hand out resumes, made his resume, set him up with crypto and stocks (from my own money) under the assumption that perhaps making money to support himself through unconventional means would interest him but absolutely nothing has stuck, all he wants to do is live in a fantasy land daily with no responsibilities whatsoever.

His parents recently sold their home and now he intends to move in with his grandparents and continue to do nothing rather than take any initiative to change at all.

Has anyone else experienced a friend who absolutely refuses to attempt to improve their living condition at all? He always claims he wants a job and wants a life and he has even told me he’s jealous that I have a girlfriend and all this stuff going for me but nothing motivates him to do anything, he wants everything handed to him and I’m afraid I am going to have to cut him off for my own well-being as this stresses me out to see him in this condition.

Any advice at all would be tremendously appreciated, thank you",4,0

There I was, the ripe age of 17. I was in love, and I mean love. Not with weed, not yet. Her name doesn't matter, but she is of critical importance. There's two reasons I spent 17 to 20 high every single day. Let me illuminate the first, my girlfriend at the time. I'm universally hated by everyone in the area around my high school. My severe ADHD was uncontrollable, I've always taken amphetamine, starting in first grade. However, by the time I was in 7th grade I'd been through 13 different types, nothing worked anymore.

So when I found myself in middle school, where rumors spread like wild fire. I was completely unable to control my impulsiveness, speech volume, and general lack of social skills. I had the appearance of a worthless silver spooned dumbass, anybody who came to my house expecting to find a broken household was met with a mansion. My father is worth about 200 million dollars, so at the time, the rumors amounted to a kid with everything as well as a mental lunatic. I think it matters to me that you know I was very distant from my parents, my dad was gone 25 days every month, and I had to provide for myself.

I've only ever had one friend, almost always other outcasts. One, amongst the four friends I've had, who was incredibly well liked and accepted. So when he told me a certain girl wanted to meet me, I happily accepted. This time however, I was at home. The difference in my ability to communicate with her was massive. Thus started a six month period where I was happier than I'd ever been. Guys will understand what it means to be ""Whipped,"" and I was whipped to ribbons. She wanted to me to work hard at being the best, so I was the best.

Nothing lasts forever, but I was hopping to die with this girl. Unfortunately, when I was on a business trip. I received messages from several of her friends, photos containing images of her car at her Ex-friend with benefits house.

Please believe me when I tell you, I was ripped to shreds. I contacted her once, told her she was toxic. Never heard back.

So now, I'm completely alone, not a person in the world who could help me.

That's reason one, two is somehow worse.

I developed a rare condition called cholinergic urticaria, never heard of it? Don't blame you. Essentially It's like a pin prick, except the pin is boiling hot and stabbed into you at full force. That's not all, now imagine thousands of these pins stabbing every nerve in your body. This will happen every time you sweat, or feel at all anxious, so all day every day. Than to add insult to injury, your body becomes covered with red bumps that look like razer burn, itching but unable to be relieved.

I desperately needed pain killers, I lived in complete fear of convulsing constantly in unbearable pain. My parents wouldn't allow anything of the sort, so after months of this, no more energy to fight with, nearing the point of suicide, I was approached by an old acquaintance. Turns out he deals weeds. The first time I smoked, it was different from the time years before. I was slapped with euphoria, a roller coast ride of dopamine had me hooked.

Wanna know something nuts? When I was high, I was essentially immune to the effects of my condition. My depression, my pain, my boredom... gone.

Little did I know I'd be ferociously smoking from than till I was arrested three years later. It started small, makeshift pipes made out of random things. Getting high was a complete luxury, one or two hits sent me tripping balls, the addiction started. It actually transpired in stages, like most people say. Over a course of a few months it went from twice a week, to everyday. I was still zooming, on top of the world! Plenty of friends in the pot world.

For about a year and a half. Bud ruled my life, honestly though that entire time, the stuff worked very well. I never felt as though it lost it's effectiveness. From small pipes to blunts, to large pipes, to several blunts, to bongs only. Only after someone offered to let me hit their distillate cart, did things go very bad.

If your experienced in the art of smoking, you know that this type of THC is a whole different ball game. To me it was, what I imagine going from snorting heroin to shooting it. I was wrecked and immediately starting buying one to smoke everyday. For a week or so I was totally wasted. Until the high turned off. Suddenly the high went from a roller coaster to a mild boost. Little did I know this would ruin me, the absolute fun I had previously experienced, would never return. I implore you, when it comes to carts and dabs, tread carefully. You might turn into an addicted rather than a stoner.

Luckily enough after finally getting into see a specialist for my condition, I was prescribed a 13 pill morning night regiment. So I'm no longer suffering. However I feel little joy in life, even after not smoking for eight months, I never get anywhere close to that first year and a half of smoking. My dreams are stilled haunted by my EX, but the frequency went from every night, to once a week. I'm still broken, and trust me there is a lot of other addiction stories to share, so if this was at all enjoyable. Please let me know if you want more stories, I'm insane for a lot of reasons.",8,1

There are moments I can go on without it for week -or 2 then the urge is there - after trying to fight it of telling myself I have a  business to run and many things to do , I do manage to fight the urge maybe for a day or 2 - but after that I use cocaine and then go and party with prostitutes 

This afcourse has had a bad outcome of my married and family life- my wife has now left saying u need to sort this out before we come back (afcourse doesn't know much about prostitutes and stuff ) but does know I go on a bender and dont come home.till the next day at times  or come home at 3-4 am coked out my head 

I finally started admitting I have a coke problem around 2 months ago - now remember I dont do coke everyday nor am i able to - i use to say my life is stressful and I need that blow out to de-stress but I finally managed to talk myself out of that and say no I have a problem- it might now be much but if you have people saying it to you and your family not wanting to come back then you have a problem 

So today is my first day of therapy 

I'm looking forward to it to be honest , Im wanting to know how triggers can be so heavy , how the urge can be to much at times to keep disciplined about it 

I'll keep you updated

My son just turned 3. Two days before his birthday, his father suffered a fatal overdose.

Some background. My son (B) hadn’t seen his father (C) in almost a year. I had to kick him out because I came home one day and found him in the bathroom in his underwear digging “bugs” out of his skin with tweezers. He had relapsed on Meth. The smell of blood and sweat in that tiny room still haunts my memories. Before that, he had been drinking heavily for two years. He would go to work, come home, drink about a gallon of cheap beer into the wee hours of the morning, sleep all day and then go to work again. He spent about 10 hours total with B a week, including on his days off when he would just want to sit him in front of the iPad all day so he could drink and watch tv.

C had two older sons from a previous relationship. At the time we met, he told me this story about how he couldn’t see them because his ex wife’s family hired a really good lawyer to get her custody in the divorce. Come to find out, they were both junkies who pretty much just drove around with their kids all day trying to get dope money and eventually lost custody. When I got pregnant, he tried to pull it together, he had quit using drugs and had a half decent job and he was paying child support. Eventually he started lying about dumb stuff and his drinking hit next level. Never violent with me or B but just unpleasant to be around.

After I kicked him out he “got clean” and would FaceTime B and me but I could tell he was using again, I’ve been clean for 6 years, I know what relapse looks like. His parents and sister denied this but when he stopped calling, I knew. Finally, I got the call that he died of an OD. 

My son is so young, he really only understands the concept of a father, he is close to my father and sees dads in videos and picking their kids up from daycare. I know he won’t ask for a while, but eventually he will ask.

What should I say?

PS- C did love B, the little time he spent with him, he could make B laugh until he wet his pants. He wanted to be a better father but it’s like it was outside of his understanding how to actually be better. Didn’t want to make it sound like he didn’t care about our son, he was just a troubled person.",7,0

Last night he crashed his car (that he manipulated my dad into co-signing a loan on) into a parked car and a pole, proably while stoned on perks, and was taken in by the police and had his blood tested for narcotics. 

He’s a type one diabetic whose been making dumb choices for the past 5 years, and is also a high functioning addict, where he has a high paying job that he’ll lose if he fails said drug test. 

He’s 30 going on 31 and manipulates my dad into giving into him constantly, both myself, my younger bro, and mom are fed up with him and my dads bullshit.

We thought he was clean but found out last night, and had it confirmed by his girl friend that this is not the case, and he never stopped using. 

We don’t know what to do, my parents are old so him coming to live back home with them would be disastrous, it has been in the past. We’re afraid that if he seeks treatment he’ll lose his job and his house, and he’s 31 so we can’t really do anything to get him treatment, without spilling the beans . He’s broke as well, so anything that happens we’ll be paying for.

101,2021-05-24 07:18:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/njvkut/perspective_is_everything_nightshift_depression/,Perspective is everything: Night-shift Depression,"I want to start by stating I am not pointing blame on anyone but myself for the events that have transpired. I made the choice to relapse, take on more work than I could handle, and ultimately stay at my current position. 

&#x200B;

A little background is I partied heavily in my late teens into my early twenties and it led me to substance addiction. My drugs of choice trended toward depressants and I got myself hooked on heroin. I used for around 7 years. In a positive light I am over 7 years out of active addition, and over 4 years completely sober. 

&#x200B;

In the past I have worked night shift for two separate stints: 8 months, and 1.5 years. 

&#x200B;

I was around 23 on the first night-shift stint working at Home Depot on the reset crew. Initially I thought I was handling myself pretty well on nights, but in hindsight I deteriorated pretty rapidly. I had moved cities to try and escape my addiction and as I learned, running from problems never works. Instead of using heroin I was drinking regularly. Once I switched to night shift I can definitively say my drinking increased. Instead of reaching out for help I decided to again jump down the black hole and start using again. 

&#x200B;

My second and longest stint I was working full-time for a microchip wafer manufacturing plant. I had been sober for around three years once I started and I had been making strong decisions toward my mental health and future: community college, consistent weight lifting and exercise, and a strong social life. I was able to manage night shift pretty well for the first four months. I had strong grades in all of my classes and somehow got an A in my pre-calc class. That semester on Wednesday of every week I had a morning and afternoon class followed by my 12 hour graveyard shift starting at 7pm. In hindsight I do not know how I managed it. When signing up for the next semester I took my good grades into account and signed up for an increased workload. I was majoring in computer science at the time so I signed up for Calc 1, Chemistry, and a couple of Computer Networking courses. Once the spring semester started I crumbled quickly. Actually, my mental state was pretty bad before I started the semester. Working nights in the winter is a tough gig. Forget about seeing the sun for a few months. During the winter I had started to have a beer or two socially (bad decision). My rationalization was, ""alcohol was not my drug of choice, I can handle it"". About a month into my spring semester I had already dropped Calc 1, and I was failing Chemistry. I also had an uptick in my drinking. there was one night in particular I had 3 beers by myself. I realized the path I was deciding to walk down so I stopped drinking that night. I made an appointment with my previous drug counselor, and it helped immensely. Since then I have been completely sober and I love every second.

&#x200B;

One of the things my counselor brought up is night shift is really tough on mood. He was adamant I needed to stay consistent with exercise and diet, and if possible get a day job. He also recommended to get outside and take a walk each day. Eventually I was able to get off night shift and my mood stabilized. 

&#x200B;

My current stint started in April, and it has a similar trend. I started pretty good with a positive outlook on my goals, but it has been deteriorating. Exercise is less frequent, and my relationship with my current girlfriend is pretty strained. I do not see her as much, and when I do I am in a negative mood around 50 percent of the time. Last week she wanted to have a conversation about how she is unhappy with the relationship and felt distanced. I listened and expressed my understanding to her concerns. I explained to her I am struggling on keeping myself consistent with my day to day life. Any animosity or distance was not directed at her. It was me trying to pull myself together. I also explained when I get depressed I tend to isolate myself. Once again these are my choices to isolate, and distance myself from my relationships. I am not using any substance and I will stay sober. Sober life is greater than addict life from every angle. 

&#x200B;

I have not left my night-shift job because it is an entry level career catalyst. I have an AAS in Cyber Security, and I will have my Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security after the Fall 2021 semester. My position is in a Network Operations Center. It's not Cyber Security, but it is a lot easier to break into the security workforce when you already have tech experience, in particular at least a year of experience.

I realized this entire post is me focusing on the negative and not the positive. Here are my gratitudes. I have a girlfriend that remains with me through my struggles. I have a happy and healthy family who are incredibly supportive. I have a roof over my head, food in my fridge, and a car that consistently runs. I have a job that pays decent for entry level, and in 9 months my pay will easily increase by 30% once I am off my current temp contract. I have broken into the professional tech space before I finished school. I got an A and two Bs in my courses this semester. I have only 3 courses remaining before I have my degree. I had the money and credit to enroll in a computer hacking bootcamp which I am currently attending. I just purchased an old e46 330xi project car last week (I have been wanting one for years). My younger brother recently quit drinking, has been sober for 7 months, and he is the healthiest and happiest I have seen him in years. I have counseling paid for my school and I have an appointment in two days. I have a job interview for a Cyber Security position in 5 hours, I joined a jiu-jitsu gym 4 weeks ago and I have been consistently going every Tuesday and Wednesday. 

&#x200B;

Sorry, I am not trying to butter my own biscuit. Sometimes I need to take a step back and look at things from a different perspective. 

&#x200B;

The actions I am going to take to help with my mood are: apply to other Computer Networking jobs (day shift only), apply to cyber security positions, go out of my way to show my affection to my girlfriend this week, start going for walks each evening when I wake up, exercise every other day not including my 15 minute walks, Work on my Bootcamp material every day for half an hour (2 hours is recommended, but I need to take a smaller step to get rolling again). And finally, continue to be honest and accountable for my actions. I make the choice to be happy and productive. 

&#x200B;

This was more of a rant than asking a question to the community. I feel better when I give back so if anyone has any questions about any of the subjects I just wrote about please ask and I will do everything possible to help. I am no expert but I have some methods I go through to help stay sober. I can definitely help with resume and cover letter writing, and also tech interviews. Again I'm no expert, but I'm pretty good with computer systems, networking, and security. I'm fresh to working on BMWs but any car discussion is welcomed. Thanks for your time everyone!",4,0

Addiction is a bitch. 
I often used drugs as an escape from my mind, my reality, my surroundings and my view on myself.

My boyfriend and I are both 25 and we started dating around 8 months ago during the pandemic. I truly believe we are meant to be. We have the best connection and it feels right when we are together. BUT. he used to sports bet all the time to where he owed people money it was an issue. I got him to stop gambling and he hasnt gambled since I threatened to break up with him (I know I go through all his stuff lol). Now 3 months into our relationship I went through his phone and I found him messaging all these women and some were even trans people on this site fet life, through a google voice app. He was in a way sexting them and would try to hang but would just say that and would stop talking to them. I was SO HURT and basically left him and he came on my door strep crying thewhole shabang trying to explain. He told me he would do therapy since he never did it before and he said during covid he was in his room drinking in a dark place and would get bored with normal porn and was curious about the trans people so thats why he would message them. He said he took it too far and didnt realize how bad of a problem it was and it was almost always when he was drinking he would go on there. 

The therapist told him that his dad ghosting him at 19 has really had a bad effect on him and he told me this is the first time he is working on himself and he will continue to workon himself and do whatever it takes to keep me. He also promised he never did anything in person with the girls. 

SO three months pass everything is fine, I randomly decide to look through his gmail and I see theres an party for that website fet life in nyc for swingers, and he messaged the girl and said how is it sad I couldnt be there maybe I will join the next one? and so I was like wtf !!! and he admitted to me he had a weak moment he redownloaded fet life but instantly delted it after cause he felt like garbage. SO I chose to go deeper into his google voice messages from 3 months ago when I found him sexting the girls and I FOUND that during that time before one of the girls likes to show up at guys houses and they cum on her face and she leaves and in the messages he was like ""no sex right? just cumming"" and she was like ""yeah"". I was so hurt that he did this with someone else while dating me and. I was breaking up with him and he told me that he buried that so deep in his brain cause it was so awful and that was in the time he was in a bad place messaging people and drinking and he is done with all that now. I still said no bye. Then he went to the therapist that day and she said he has something called ""self sabotage"" where he doesnt believe he deserves good things (me) so he sabotages and ruins them because his dad ghosted him so he doesnt believe he deserves anything good. and she said he has an addictive personality. he begged me to stay said that now he is aware of the issue he will never do it again since he never knew and to please give him another shot, he said it was from the past and since he didnt touch her he didnt think it was that bad in his mind then yada yada. He told me for me to trust him he would give me all his passwords. so he did. 

&#x200B;

fast forward to 2 months later I become insecure and consistently ask him whens the next time he will do this to me? hes bound do? and go a little crazy constantly feel upset about it all. I knew something wasnt right. We hang 24/7 and he told me he needs alone time sometimes for like a day to be with himself but we can talk on the phone yada yada (cause i clearly have co dependency issues lol), but Im over here not sleeping goin gthrough a rough time cause I quit adderal trying to do my day job and I wanted him to be there for me more and he wasnt. so we fought about that and he said he would get better at it once I get back from my girls trip this week. I went on girls trip and went to my fams home.

I get to my fams home hes constantly like I miss you I miss you come homeeee lets go to jersey this and that. And he helps me pay for my ticket back. same day I had a therapy app and my therapist was like tell your boyfriend to watch the drinking it leads to bad things. I told him and he was so annoyed he was like I am exhausted I had to wake up so early to work and now your telling me to stop drinking yada yada Ill work on it ok. I was like ok sorry didnt mean to make you stressed after work.....

then were texting and hes like I miss you and helps me buy my ticket back home to see him. he texts me ""im taking my contacts out goodnight"" and Im just like maybe we should get the passwords switched its not healthy for me to have them and your building trust back. I he was like ""say goodnight haha"". I INSTANTLY see he switched his gmail password! I was like wtf why did you do that thats sketchy?? I had his work email he didnt know about and saw he called an uber on it!!! and moved uber notifications to that email.I call he doesnt answer. He finally face times me and says hes getting zyn. Im like no youre not I have no idea where that is. and then he was like ""i lied. I did drink today after telling you I didnt. and I was going to that asian massage place but im turning around"". And i said we are over and hung up. he called me ten times I didnt answer. 

&#x200B;

I told his mom everything, and because I broke up withhim he still went to the happy ending place and got the h\*nd job :) he is now in therapy for his issues and in this program called safe.

He told me he is going to change for not only himself but so he can be with me again. I hope me leaving is a wake up call for him to fix and address his issues. hes clearly heartbroken now. he said he thought he had his issues under control but felt under a microscope with me having his passwords and believes he was actually burying them deeper not dealing with them and he said he has never done anything like this before. 

&#x200B;

A few hours later while laying in bed, I suffered the second worst panic attack I’ve ever had, and had a three hour episode of tachycardia. I thought I was going to die.

Currently 11 weeks in and I’m struggling. 

I’ve drunk alcohol most weeks of the last 12 years, smoked a joint or two most weekends for the last 3ish years, and in the last 6 months prior to sobriety used cocaine probably every 2nd weekend (Max 1/2 a gram at a time). I guess I’ve always classified my usage of drugs and alcohol as manageable. With cannabis, I generally think it has some therapeutic effect on me, but also recognize that it leaves me a little ‘foggy’ for the week or 2 after. 

I know that for the last 9 years I’ve battled with dysthymia- chronic lowered mood that at times has dipped into the ‘depression’ territory. This dysthymia is coupled with very poor sense of self worth, particularly related to achievement and anxiety around how others perceive me.  When I was using cocaine it made me feel great. Even in the ‘down’ few days after the weekend, I never felt terrible because I had experienced the high on the weekend and had that to think about. Unfortunately that also led me to think about the next high and I noticed this was becoming too prevalent in my life - thinking about when the next event or celebration was that I could justify buying some coke for. Some close friends and I literally had the best summer we’ve ever had and a lot of it revolved around drinking and partying and doing lines together. 

Fast forward to 11 weeks in, and I’m struggling to find happiness in life and feel like I don’t have much to look forward to. I have had an injury for a few months which has prevented me from exercising, so I know I’m not getting the endorphins from that. I love my partner and treasure the time we have together because it’s honestly one of the only things that lifts me up. However I don’t want exercise and my partner to be the only things that give me that ‘hit’ and I’d like to feel that sense of happiness again. I’m extroverted and am regularly ‘the life of the party’ but lately I just feel like I don’t have it in me. 

In a few weeks time we’re going away for my best friends birthday for a few nights. There’ll be a big group of people and there’ll be alcohol and cannabis and most likely drug use. I’m contemplating breaking my sobriety plan (which I’ve told so many people about - a tactic I occasionally use when I want to keep myself accountable for something) and buying some cocaine for the weekend. I just want to feel happy and enthused and be apart of the atmosphere and I don’t know if I’ll be able to do that sober. I’m thinking I’ll still stay off the alcohol and cannabis and try and keep that going. 

I’m super self critical and know that I’ll be hard on myself and label myself a ‘failure’ if I don’t make sure I’m ok with this first. I’ve managed to work myself up into a spin thinking about whether breaking my all-substance sobriety is me being weak and a failure, or whether I can afford myself this hall-pass and relax on my generally stoic nature and have a good time with my friends. 

TLDR - should I allow myself to do a bit of coke 1/4 of my way through a year of sobriety (first and foremost from alcohol but extending to substances), and if I do, how do I stop myself feeling like a complete failure and fraud?",1,0

Over the past year she was in and out of rehab facilities throughout the US and nothing seemed to work. The old saying is you’ll either die or go to prison. Geeh prison sounds pretty good right now. My sister and I haven’t had a real sibling relationship since I was 18 and I’ve harbored a lot of resentment over her choices. A lot of hurtful things were said and done by both us but I’d prefer a dysfunctional family to death.

Therapy hasn’t worked, suboxone didn’t work, rehab didn’t work, tough love didn’t work, but now my opinion is that the only thing that could have helped her is god.

I'm now addicted to 2mg klonopin a day and 50mg roxy's that are sometimes real sometimes like last night I'm pretty sure I almost died. I almost woke up my dad but just jumped in a cold shower and chugged milk. It worked but I had to fight it for hours.

I’m a very sexual person but my urge to get off multiple times a day is time consuming, physically draining, and not good for me mentally. I’ve always been private about watching porn and it’s transferred over to me being private whenever I go online. It’s difficult for me whether it’s online dating, social media, or even just being on Reddit, to resist and not look for something sexual or create something sexual. It’s embarrassing to admit.. but I would have moments of hitting on/sexting people on social media platforms that I really had no real desire besides the sexual. Online dating I’d often spend hours and hours trying to flirt with and meet up with people I just wanted to hookup with and rarely creating a genuine connection... Even when my intentions are not to make things sexual online I still find myself leaning in that direction... my self control in person is great, but it’s genuinely made me worried about my online self control for sex. I’m scared to be on any social media because I don’t want to turn back into a flirting/sexual guy who spends hours a day trying to sext ppl to help me get off..

I attend a party college so it is common for being to drink tons and do drugs to party. I never picked it up because I never had a dealer or any guy who sold it. My friends would always have it then they’d offer me a line and that’d be it for me. 

Fast forward to my fifth year here, I roomed with random roommates. They were definitely some of the coolest roommates and lifelong friends. They taught me that I didn’t need to room with people I know to make friends. However they are in a top tier fraternity here and as a result they have access to a ton of drugs. 

One of the roommates, who I got the closest to here, had a coke problem junior year. He still dabbled in it frequently for most of this semester. The other guy was in the same frat and he looked at it as a normal thing in college. As a a result, me and my friend thought it’d be okay to dabble in it too. 

It started off with my roommate giving me his dealers number which gave us access to it whenever we wanted. My friend never did coke so we started only buying it on the weekends. I had experience so I kind of showed him the ropes. 

I failed to realize coke would help me so much when going to bars. Even alcohol never gave me the sense of confidence that cocaine gave me. I went from being an awkward dude to being the most confident I’ve ever been. I could make friends and talk to girls with ease.

This is what led to me using it so often. I figured it was better than my weed habit in the sense of not being so withdrawn from everyone and lonely. I also was aware of my addictive personality and I quickly became scared at the possibility of a cocaine addiction.

I ended up being a bigger coke addict than anyone who used it. My friend knew not to mess with it too often and even my roommates kicked the habit. However I’m the only one who is still using it. I only have a few more days of college so I figured I go out and enjoy it.

But I quickly realized that coke rules the party atmosphere. It’s like a demon that manages to track me down. I never used to know anyone that sold it or had it. But in the past week I’ve been offered it so many times it’s unbelievable. Not only that, but I realized many people use coke to party . This only normalized it more.

Tonight I went with some friends to a bar without any intention to do or find coke. Of course, one cool guy I was talking to offered me a line. I was drunk and feeling awkward so I didn’t even hesitate. Next thing I know I’m copping a gram off of him. He packed it so fat I have a lot now.

So I sit here debating if I should just flush it down the toilet. I spent hard earned money and it’s making me debate it. But the party scene is over, I don’t have any reason to even use it. I know i may end up doing it alone and I feel that will confirm my addiction. It’s one thing doing it at a party and doing it alone.

The dude who sold it to me even explained that coke ruins your dopamine. He said it was better to feel good from accomplishments instead of drugs. It was weird to hear that from someone selling me drugs. The most chilling part was this dude was 30 and still using it to party. 

It made me worry that I may be in a similar if not worse position if I don’t stop now. I don’t want to be a coke head. I cringe when I look back to doing lines alone in the bathroom. I’d even lie to my friend about the amount at times just so I could do it myself. It’s like I think I’m fooling people to think I’m this confident when I’m actually just on drugs...",10,0

I dont really like benzos either, the only reason i take them/alcohol is to try to numb the pain or come down from adderall/a stressful day. 

I hate myself for stealing from my dad. He stopped using his oxycodone because it was his breakthrough pills, but I can't imagine he won't notice at this point. I want to tell them and ask for help, but I've asked for help before and from their perspective im doing much better and have a good job and I'm so afraid of how they'll react when i tell them what ive been doing. 

I'm still prescribed adderall and I've even considered telling my parents that we discontinued the medication and keeping the pills for me to abuse. 

I hate myself for how I'm acting but I hate living in the real world even more. Without substances, I don't know how to cope. I have a great girlfriend but she doesn't know what I struggle with because its not her problem and ive only been dating her for a month or so. 

I need help, I know that I do, but I'm so afraid of being sent to inpatient rehab or disappointing my parents and admitting that I've stolen from my dad. Its just so much easier to numb the pain but the comedowns and the depression are even worse.

I've quit porn for some time now. Having had researched about this topic previously, not much is stated upon the problem of egirls. Personally, I'm wondering if SFW egirls cause social apathy and thus arousal addiction. The aspect of social apathy, and the decrease in value of simple pleasures caused by a porn addition seems to still happen with me. However, I'm not sure if egirls are the case.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I've had my own array of benefits from quitting porn; however I do follow egirls on instagram. I've been doing it for years now, and I've wondered if the situation described above hasn't been resolved due to egirls. To elaborate, I still have pretty bad social anxiety. Solely driven by emotion, I will develop an incredible stutter and thus I've been antisocial when I choose (aka, when I'm not felin confident). So, I'm wondering if you guys think that SFW imagery, which still may be considered pornography by definition, is a (lesser, but still prevalent) cause of arousal addiction.",2,0

150,2021-05-21 02:03:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/nhlgml/recovery/,Recovery,"Hey guys. I haven’t been on here in around a year or so now, honestly it didn’t even cross my mind until now. I relapsed several times while trying to get clean from Benzos, Opioids and Alcohol, I was physically addicted to all three (although I could get by with one or the other of Alcohol or Benzos, naturally). I tried and tried, and in the process my wife left me (unrelated reasons, but addiction played its part), and I just lost myself. I ramped up dosages on everything over the course of the next 2 or 3 months, lost my job, got a DUI and went to jail, lost my truck, my apartment, friends, family, and like I said my wife and youngest son. When I got out of jail after the weekend, I went home and gave up. I regressed very quickly and ended up in a dark place and didn’t want to live or at the very least be conscious. So I dosed and dosed and drank and drank all day every day, and every day I lied on my couch just using and crying, bawling even, and begging to just not exist anymore. I was absolutely at my worst rock bottom that I had ever hit, and I thought I had hit it several times before. I’m not sure exactly what happened inside me or inside my mind whether subconsciously or at some level consciously, but one day I told myself out of nowhere that I was going to try again. I called my aunt in Utah and my mom, both of whom had dropped little hints here and there trying not to push me but letting me know treatment is an option at the same time hoping I would change my mind. My aunt set everything up and I got absolutely blitzed out of my mind because I felt like I was giving up in a way, maybe because I couldn’t do it on my own. So two days later, my dad was picking me up from my apartment to take me down to Ogden Regional to their ACT (Alcohol and Chemical Treatment) facility, and for the first time in my life I checked into inpatient treatment in a state where I was alone with no chance of just leaving and walking home, no friends to pick me up, no family to pressure if it came to that, and these were the reasons I chose to go where I did. Something changed in me and I decided I didn’t want to die. At the point that I texted my aunt to set it up, I was puking at least three times a day, usually somewhere around 5 or 6, my body just was rejecting anything and everything and it was shutting down. I hadn’t eaten for 5 days, hadn’t drank more than a smart water bottle over the course of 3 days, hadn’t slept more than maybe 2 hours a night, hadn’t showered or left the apartment in over a week and was isolating from my wife who at the time was gone and family. My body was just rejecting anything I put into it, including drugs and alcohol. I could not keep it down and as a result I became more violently ill. I was a hollow body that just existed as a shell of a being. I had nothing to live for I felt, and no reason to stop using or killing myself. I don’t know what internal epiphany or resolve happened, but I followed through and rode with my dad to detox. I was in the detox unit for 3 days, during which period I still had a part of myself convinced that I was just going to do the 3 days detox and then come back home and do outpatient on my own. I had the most caring and compassionate counselor during my time period in detox. He checked on me constantly, gently probing me to learn more about me, and at the end of the 3 days he seemed like he knew me personally. He read me right off the bat and I trust him, so when he guided me to stay in inpatient there over the 3 days, on my last day he convinced me to stay. So they did my intake into the inpatient or residential unit, where I stayed for 28 days learning more and practicing skills and slowly getting my feet under me without being violently sick, just well enough to push through. My counselor was there with me every step of the way, all while he was determining my mental state and history, traumas and formulating a very concise insight and diagnoses before sharing them with me and helping me create a plan for treatment for both drug abuse and my mental illness to help me address everything I had repressed. I moved back in to my parents house after my 28 days in inpatient, as my wife and I were separated and I didn’t have a home to go back to. I stayed living at their house for about 5 months using them as a support system and a relapse prevention system. I felt confident but I knew relapse happens to the best of us so I kept my goals realistic. Last month, I moved out of their house into my own apartment after landing a once in a lifetime dream job in March, a job that I feel the chances of were next to nothing as I had more on my record now and hadn’t worked for about 5 months. I was offered the job and took it, I saved a bit for about a month and a half before I felt it was time. I put money down for an apartment while still living with my parents, and got some stuff moved over prior to moving in. My wife and I have been back together since December, we are doing couples therapy along with my therapy, and I am working my way through Intensive Outpatient. I currently have phased up to level 2 which means less classes per week and less responsibilities, I have a great job and a nice apartment, my relationship with my parents and my brothers is better than ever, I am reliable and more trustworthy and I feel again. I feel a love for my wife and sons more than the love I repressed before or numbed myself so much that I couldn’t feel it. I am doing great at my career and feel so much better, I look better and healthy again, and my loved ones are so proud of me which is a feeling I never thought I’d encounter again. I feel pride in myself for once, and I have confidence and as a result my anxiety has gone down. I feel competent, like I’m needed in my work and home life both, and I feel looked at as more of an equal than I have in a long time. I know this post is long and most of you won’t read the entire thing which is okay, I just wanted to get this out there and off of my chest as I haven’t really expressed the entirety of my recent life and world.

Im on a soccer field, it's not something I would do but would do it for a laugh, I say to myself ""I'll leave once I score a goal"". But the goal is not being scored. 

Im obsessed with scoring the goal. I keep missing. I keep re-evaluating to be better while thr world passes me by. All I gotta do is leave the field and forget about it. Admit I wasted my time and move on. Yet I just need to score a goal. Its easy. I can do it.

“Hey Mama, think it would be okay if I come stay with y’all for a little while?”

Of course she can...I pick her up as soon as she is ready. She always has all her things with her so each time bears the promise of a broken heart. I know she isn’t planning to stay more than five days, but this Mama’s heart leaps a tiny bit when I see all those bags.

She comes home and unpacks everything. Washes all her clothes and bags. Organizes her bathroom like she wants it to be. She requests her Dad cook her favorite meal, and he is so happy to oblige. We sit and talk about all the things unrelated to heroin or fentanyl or needles or Narcan or rehab, until it’s time for her to dose~ then, she brings her gear to the kitchen where she prepares and does her shot with me in the room so that I can provide rescue breaths and Narcan should she need help. Or, maybe she doesn’t use at all this time. Maybe this time she wants to eat and nap and spend the afternoons on the porch talking to me while listening to her Dad play guitar. 

When she’s ready to leave the next morning or five days later, she leaves without warning. But there is no arguing or angst. I am so blessed that she calls me every day and wants to see me. And even though she is still using IV opiates, I want her here. Of course, if she were to decide to come home long term, we would need to move forward with securing her a safe supply (methadone or suboxone) but she isn’t ready for any of that yet. 

But she always leaves as she has a mission of her own. Her people~her chosen family~need her desperately. She makes certain everyone has Narcan and they know how to use it. She teaches them how to use fentanyl test strips, makes sure someone does a test shot first, and insists when using with a group, they all stagger their shots. 

She has chosen to grow where she is planted for now. Her use is significantly less as she now feels a duty to educate those around her in ways to reduce harm. “Mama, I can’t keep my friends safe if I’m fucked up all the time.” She does three small doses daily~ just enough to not be sick. I hear from her every day. I always know where she’s at because she volunteered to give me access to her location so I wouldn’t worry as much. 

I see positive changes that are 100% driven by her wants and needs. It is ONLY because I choose to love her where she’s at that I get to see these changes at all. Tough love isn’t love here. Rock bottom here equals death. My baby knows I love her unconditionally and should this chapter of her life end tonight, I will have no regrets.",127,0

I’m currently trying to stop doing it. Been a week sober. I got drunk tonight snd per usual- I craved it. I didn’t do it though. Just went and got a kebab and watched charmed. 

I’ve finished my kebab. I’m still drunk. And still craving it. I feel so anxious. I know not to do it- I’m not going to.. but god this feeling is horrible. I can’t sleep because I’m so anxious.

How do other people cope with getting drunk and then having cravings for drugs? Let me make everyone aware- this isn’t my first time feeling like this, going through this. I’m just, for the first time, reaching out to reddit to help me find a way to cope. 

If anyone has any advice on how to deal drug withdrawals.. when you’re drunk.. and even on a daily basis.. I would love some advice.. 

Will flag now: I don’t want any advice saying “eat healthy, sleep well and exercise”. I’m fully aware that this is a great way to help your body... but I need something deeper then they right now.

It didn't go well. I had 3 anxiety attacks in the first week there. The next week, I became impatient and irritable, having emotional outbursts. They took me out of group sessions to allow me to stabilize my moods with limited success. Finally, I left last night during an anxiety attack. 

As this was all happening, I really felt like a failure. I had come with the goal of completing a program, but just wasn't able to handle it. I should add that I have a few (well 6) mental health diagnosis, mostly around anxiety(Generalized anxiety, Social anxiety and substance induced anxiety disorder) and bipolar(Other specified). I was in a concurrent disorder program and we started working through some of my issues. But the combination of the therapy, plus group living became just too much for me. I just didn't have enough private time to process everything that was happening. 

But I am not a failure! I tried something I knew would be difficult. I took steps to start managing my emotions. I learned about some thought patterns I need to work through. I managed to make it 30 days without using. I learned how and when to take my anxiety meds for better efficiency. I did not finish the program like I had set out to do, but I did the best I could and am taking away lessons that I plan to use in my everyday life. 

To anyone considering rehab but not sure you can do it, I would say to try. Even if you don't finish the program, you can learn some valuable lessons that will help you after you leave.",5,0

I started smoking as 14 years old. (also started with speed and mdma back then, between 16 and 20 I took speed and mdma nearly every weekend).
I quit Chems with 21 completely, it changed nothing for me - it was sooo easy. I just stopped buying - skipped the raves and parties and thats it.

With Cannabis i have no clue, since I'm 23 i try to quit that too but my Jobsituation, Livingsituation and also my addiction made it impossible.

I have cannabis in my morning routine, at work (homeoffice and studio), in its a part of my relationship (literally its the only thing we do together), nearly all my friends smoke weed on the same base as me or use time with me to get high.

I used to deal with it and stopped because i thought it would help. I threw away my grinder, rolling plate, scale etc (and bought that all again inbetween). I started with cbd, i isolated myself (to avoid my smoking friends but it ended up in smoking even more). Also i tried smoking in general, tried it in an other city, with a new job, with plans and new routines that didn't help. My brain always pre-implemented Cannabis.

I tried sport - ended up in doing shit like smoking a big joint then doing pushes until I'm in trance.

It has horrible consequences to my life - i paffed away every financial backup, also my insurance money...
All tries to get financial stable get eaten by my brain that tells me ""you now have more money, now you can buy 10 grams, not only 2 hehe""
Really. I had several payments worth 700-1000 euros. Put them all in weed.

I tried to quit smoking so often and in so many ways that I'm even scared to talk to my friends about it - they don't take me serious about it anymore :(

My mental health is decreasing - i had burnout in 2018, in 2020 i got Bipolar disorder and PTSD diagnosed (ptsd idicated by cannabis).

I had to cancel my reha for the job i have now.

All my tries to get in therapy failed, I'm feeling lost. Would need help, the people i have to reach out tell me ""you have to handle this on your own"" but i srsly don't know how...",3,0

I’m a 36 year old male with a cannabis problem.  I know that weed is nothing compared to meth or opiates or something but I’ve pretty much been permanently stoned since the age of 17.  For years I’ve been kidding myself that the habit was manageable but unfortunately Covid and the resulting lockdown / isolation have made clear that was a lie.  For the last year I’ve been living life as a paranoid, anxiety ridden hermit and my life has suffered drastically for it.

This morning I went and handed over my bank cards and ID to my brother for safe keeping.  This means I have no access to cash, just Apple Pay on my phone for buying groceries etc (I live in the UK, dealers don’t take PayPal).  I’ve also lined up a huge to do list for the next few days to keep busy.  Idle hands do the devils work and all that... 🤷‍♂️

When addiction hit, it hit like a locomotive. When I entered recovery, it felt like I was pulling a train uphill. I thought to myself many times “what’s the point” and that “things would never change”. I would look at people with years and decades in recovery and believed that my life and mind would always be a slave to addiction until… they were not. To anyone struggling in their recovery, know that with consistency and the right perspective, your life will literally transform itself, however you will always lose at this waiting game. 

We always hear that recovery is a journey not an event. Me 5 years ago would be defeated at the thought of this long-term struggle, but this mentality is what always led to me returning home to my rock bottom. In this video I share some things that would have been helpful for me when crossing the bridge from addiction to recovery, take from it what you can and take control of your life friends.

We thought that was enough to scare her into trying to get clean but I don’t think she ever did.

Lately she’s been acting very strangely but I’m not sure if it’s drug related. I don’t see her often so I didn’t want to assume but she’s just being weird? For example, she is ALWAYS late to everything. It’s as if time means nothing to her. You could be waiting outside her house for an hour and she’s just doing whatever, as if she literally doesn’t realize how much time is passing. It’s getting so out of hand and my family is frustrated but idk why she does that. 

She will fall asleep if given the chance at any moment and I did notice her head bobs when she does which I know can be a sign of being high but maybe she’s just nodding off?

If anyone has any experiences with opioids (pills) and knows what the signs of someone using are I would love some insight. Thank you!",6,0

He was obviously high when he arrived.  I assume he smoked right before he came, and he didn’t use while he was here. He stayed for three hours or so, and after he left I went straight to bed.

When I got up this morning, I couldn’t find my meds anywhere. I have another script on file with the pharmacy, but they can’t fill it until the 23rd.

&#x200B;

I am 23 years old and my opiate addiction is pretty heavy, I function normally on 250-300MG a day oxycontin, I feel fine, no sleepyness, nodding, energy is great, my emotion is stable and I function as a normal human.

&#x200B;

However anything below or above that amount and I start going a bit off the rails, to low and I lose all emotion and lust for life, to high and I just don't feel good, I start sleeping a lot, lose track of time, don't care anymore etc.

&#x200B;

This is very heavy for me, although for the wrong reasons? I am fine with it. I feel fine, I function fine but my environment thinks it's bad for me and I should quit. My doctor doesn't want to have any of it. She just calls me a junkie and that's it. My mom and dad just think its terrible and a shit habit, which it is, yes I am addicted, oh god the withdrawals and fuck I'll do anything to get another fix if I don't reach that 250-300 a day, my minimumbar is 180\~ anything below that and I turn suicidal. I am going to a rehab center soon to seek some kind of treatment but I don't agree with this at all, it's more because everyone else wants me to...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What the heck do I do people? I feel like I am tearing everyone apart over an issue that doesn't exist in my head. I don't want to go back to how 16 year old me felt, suicidal, depressed, alone, I just, no.. I tried coming off but no. Just no. It doesn't feel good, It doesn't feel right, I can't function... It's just to much.

&#x200B;

Even now I am writing this in disgust simply because I am so set in my ways of using and not thinking it's bad. I don't use heroin, I use Oxycontin and only Oxycontin, I don't snort or inject it, I get regular bloods, my liver is fine, kidneys are fine, constapation doesn't exist for me somehow, all is well, I even can eat and that's an amazing thing after having a bariatric surgery that just made me stop eating all together..

Since I was a freshman in high school, I’ve been vaping. I started using the Juul when it first came out and went through about a pack of four pods each week. Since then, I have switched to the disposable e-cigarettes like Puff Bar and AirBar since the Juul restrictions kicked into place. I’ve been vaping every day since freshman year. Almost 7 years later, I haven’t stopped. I was wondering if anyone who picked up nicotine at a young age has any stories. I love my e-cigarette so much, and I don’t want to give it up, but I feel it may be about that time.",1,0

She had been using every other day from Jan-Nov of 2020 and took an extreme turn using every single night/day during December. It got very dangerous very quickly, but she agreed to get help and all has been really well (so we thought) until today. 

My family found out she has been using again. We know for certain of 3 times she used this past month because she told us while under the influence this morning. She is convinced she is fine and handling things well. That being said, we’ve only been able to talk to her while she is extremely high so she won’t even remember today come tomorrow when she wakes up. 

She has an okay job in her field and is currently in grad school. She has a lot going for her, but can’t seem to understand what’s at risk nor does she care. She’s color coded and if caught breaking any law (including failing drug tests) she will immediately go to jail. 

If anyone has any advice on how I can help her please let me know. I’m desperate. I want her to know how loved and brilliant she is but she has a hard time believing it and finding a reason to live let alone stay clean. Any words of advice or literally anything would be greatly appreciated.

((Scroll to bottom for actual question))

As of right now im taking Methadone from the clinic. 100mg. Also in the morning since its been so hard for me just to get up and go to the clinic ive been using illicit stimulants. Thats my current drug usages ive pretty much cut out all and any illicit opioids in the past week or two. 

But from battling my Substance Use Disorder, Depression, Bi polar disorder, insomnia, ADHD, and so many other problems that drugs caused and or amplified. I just haven’t been able to function. Before drugs I was pretty normal. Could function fine and when I would be in depressed, I could still due the bare minimum to get through the work day/my day. Insomnia was just something I was able to cope with, since Ive had it my whole life. Always knew my sleep was shit and hated waking up tired more than often for school but didn’t realize how bad my sleep actually was. Also the ADHD now has possibly become a miss diagnosis. And was actually Bipolar disorder the whole time(manic stages). Or the both, and the bipolar was just hidden by the ADHD. 

But the thing is the only things I was diagnosed with was ADHD, insomnia, when I was younger anxiety(its just still on my medical record). And lastly the Substance Use Disorder. The depression and bipolar I was never technically diagnosed with. But I’ve been prescribed welbutrin and seraquel in the past. 

But anyways anyone know if I can get financial aid? Im in the US (CA) to be more precise.",2,0

I’ve been really doing well for the better part of 3 years, and it’s like it happened in the blink of an eye. 


As soon as I came down enough, and got some sleep I woke up and flushed all of it. Now I feel like crap. The withdrawal sucks, but mostly because I feel like I just threw out 3 years of hard work, and progress. 

The good news, I guess is that I’ve not put my financial life in jeopardy, I’m still ahead on all my bills, and I’m lucky enough to have an amazing wife who put up with my BS, and encouraged me to be honest with her through all of this. 


She says not to feel so bad, and that sometimes these things happen, but it still really sucks. I just got an amazing job, and of all times to relapse it had to be now. 

I’m on day 2 of being off it, but still just really bummed that it happened. Can anyone relate?

If someone walked into a hospital on crutches to receive treatment for a broken foot, the hospital would treat the broken foot, not take away the crutch. Dr. Adi Jaffe, a mental health, addiction, and stigma professional uses this analogy to describe how America views and treats addiction. Dr. Jaffe believes the root cause of addiction, the crutch, is mental health and it is the mind that needs healing. Rather too often people are labeled and shamed for their mental health struggles and default of substance abuse. Dr. Jaffe makes the point that in order to remedy this 40-60% relapse rate (within a year) of individuals with substance abuse problems, people truly need to practice moderation and seeking help for mental health issues.",2,0

Let me go back in time a little. I was an anesthesia resident and started abusing Propofol. For those that don’t know, Propofol is an IV medication used to put people to sleep before major surgery. It’s also the same drug that killed Michael Jackson. It is typically not a drug of abuse or recreationally used. But as an anesthesiologist, I had carte blanche and unlimited access. The thing with this drug is the person using is either found out fairly soon because they fall out or they end up dead. I was lucky, it only took 3 weeks before I was found out by my colleagues and had no choice but to voluntarily go to rehab. I spent 14 weeks of residential inpatient treatment and came out thinking I was “cured”.  Of course, those that are much smarter and wiser than me, felt anesthesia was not a safe viable option for me as a career and I was dismissed from a very prestigious program in the northeast.  I was lost, bitter, resentful and clearly didn’t get it.  I desperately scrambled into the first program that would take a damaged junkie doctor and reluctantly switched specialties. I had to self report my drug abuse to the state board of medicine and entered into a professional monitoring program for 5 years.  This consisted of random visits from the board of medicine, weekly- monthly random drug tests, weekly meetings with other impaired healthcare providers.  I finished this program successfully without any incident, clean and sober and redeemed. I have been sober since 2007.  This all changed this past January, I relapsed, after 14 fucking years!!!  Since then, I have put my family through hell, become a pathological liar, a recluse and someone that I barely recognize.  I have become completely obsessed. When I use, all common sense and decency go out the window. I have so many things to be grateful for and yet I risk them all for this drug. My daughter hates me now, calls me the most immoral person she knows.  Before all this, I received a personal call from one of her teachers wanting to let me know that she wrote a wonderful tribute to me about how much she admired me and how I am the most honest, influential and inspiring person she has known.  Well, not anymore!  My wife, who stuck with me through my first debacle, is just beside herself with worry and dread that she will find me dead someday.  I have wrecked 2 cars while driving impaired.  I have treated patients while being fucked up. My family have found me on the floor multiple times unconscious, bleeding from my IV site, barely breathing and unarousable.  Of course, I minimize everything, convince everyone to cover for me and have faced little consequence for my indiscretions.  I am a coward and refuse to get the help I clearly need for fear of losing my career (again), my status and tarnishing the image I have worked so hard to build. I really don’t know why I’m posting this, catharsis more than anything I suppose. Pray for me, that I can get my shit together before it’s too late.  Sorry so long!!",15,0

I'm really nervous that when he comes back he won't want to be with me anymore.

I have a great friend and I love her with everything I have but, she is really addicted. First softdrugs, then drinking, cutting herself, harddrugs and now she claims to be free of her addiction.

She is still underaged. 17. I am 18 which is the legal age here to buy weed. She asked me to buy her some, but I just can't. I know she is mad at me because of it, but I just hate seeing her spiral into these things. She keeps lying to everyone about her drug use. It's becoming worse over time. She told me she was just tired, she did 6 XTC pills that night. I just really don't know what to do and I am lost. She has therapy to cope with her trauma, but she is just not being honest to everyone. I know she feels alone and she wants to feel the void by using drugs. I told her smoking almost everyday is nearly as bad as doing harddrugs, but she just doesn't believe me.

She tells me I am addicted as well, I am not really addicted since I didn't use stuff all the time. I do however, use drugs or alcohol to fill void, which is a sign of addiction I believe. However, I don't drink or use drugs often, so I can say I am not addicted and I don't go search effectively for drugs.

I am so terribly sorry for the long post and possibly bad English, but I am completely lost.",2,0

Sorry it's alittle long...
Thank you

I have been diagnosed add since I was 18 I am 26 now
Life before Adderall was living in my dad's basement sleeping on moldy mattress in 6 feet of literally garbage and piss bottles.
When I turned 18 I finally had control over my mental health.
Things got really good really fast!
All the sudden like almost immediately school was interesting my social life flourish I could keep everything clean and in order.
Quite frankly life was a little boring because everything was done!
Fast forward to 20. 
....
....
...
I hate this part...
...
...
The first person ever to pay any attention to me ever.
She would make take more then my daily amount so I be ""sweet"" to her.....I was young and dump and she was 40 and a gaslight. 
It went from 45mgs a day to 60 to 100 so on so forth.
It was like this for 2 years.

After I finally figured it out that she was using me
I was taking so many pills I can't even tell you how much I was taking a day. I used the excuse that I had to piss hard to get in to my electrical Union.
More and more...
People love me everything is getting done life if moving so so so well!!

Now I'm here.
Trying so hard to not have to take a enormous amount of the stuff to get out of bed...takes about 200 mgs before the brain fog and fatigue to be manageable....not feeling good but enough to get ony feet and do anything...
It takes another 200mgs through out the day (I take them when I feel like I need to) to stay proactive and to have a social life and to work.

My family knows I struggle with it.
Time.and time again...
I'll be stone cold sobber and they believe that. Fucked up!!
They say I am so sluggish not there mental mean angry that I sleep for days literal days. My record is 6 days only to wake up to use the bathroom.

When I'm totally speeding out of my mind
They say see you are.so much better sober your sweet kind and funny you get things done we love you when you are ""sober""

Why is it I have a problem when everything is moving so we'll in life...
When I don't have a problem everything goes to shit.
EVERYTHING!
iv looked for help iv turned myself in to my union and employers and they don't care.
Well if you got a script what's the problem they say...
I'm buying alot. A shit load of them.

I rather take the pills then live ony couch in 6feeet of garbage....

Edit - thanks to all the replies!

I skipped a part and used my words wrong - I was talking about cocaine. I am still clean, in the morning after. 12 weeks, staying strong.

The party friends are the coke buddies I ditched. I broke up with them and there’s no turning back. The “sober” friends I mentioned are the ones that don’t do drugs. But they all drink, and drink a lot. But my friend thinks I drink more than everyone. It’s true that I exaggerate sometimes. Not all the times. But yes, some times. And she thinks I will do drugs or search for drugs, which I am not doing anymore, for real.   

But I messed up yesterday.  I accidentally drank too much last night. I was keeping it cool, just a few drinks and water, and for some stupid reason I thought it was a good idea to take a dose of scotch. That I NEVER drink. So I guess my friend is right about my drinking problem. 

Nothing bad happened, I stayed clear from coke, didn’t even think about really, but maybe I should  go for the full sober, if all the fingers are being pointed at me.",79,0

Addiction is such a serious thing, and I hope everyone who is fighting it is doing well and I believe in you! I'm just feeling really low and looking for tips to help deal with this unhealthy obsession.

I (consider myself) to be addicted to videos. Any kind of videos really, mainly I watch tv shows and movies, but if I can't watch a movie or a show, then I'll go on Youtube and start drowning myself if any kind of videos. Ten years ago-ish I started a list of all the stuff I was watching, but I only wrote down half of what I watched, since I didn't write down any of the USA shows or movies I watch. So that one list has acquired me 167 full days of watched material, 4,000 hours of watched material. And that's barely half, since most of the other stuff I didn't add to my list, especially the Youtube videos. If I would've spent this time doing something else, I'd be expert in an instrument or language or something.

I hate this addiction, I hate that I need these videos. I get angsty if I haven't watched anything, I usually wake up to videos and go to sleep to them to. I work and study Uni, and I literally split my screen so I can watch stuff while I work or study. I love music too, but at least that's not an unhealthy obsession. I know I'm obviously escaping reality or substituting some unresolved feelings through the videos. Most times I'd prefer just to stay home and watch stuff rather than meet family or friends. Especially because I just find people quite disappointing... my mother is a narcissist, so I might be one in the making.

Anyway, I just hate this part of me and this dependency for my brain to keep busy, when I can't focus on other things. I cut myself off cold or try to do those website restrictive additions, but I always fail after a day or so, and the extensions are just too easy to turn off. Since I need internet to work and study, I also can't put myself in a wifi-less place... even though I dream of having house in the woods lmao. If only I could live out there. Everyone is so smart and I feel like a dumbed water downed version of what I could be...

Does anyone have any tips? It's affecting my life so much, and especially with the finals now, I can't even write 1 page a day cause I keep watching new tv shows and what not. I try turning the videos off, but I just always turn them back on.",7,0

He took about half for pain, and one night I had a nasty headache and (with his express knowledge and agreement), took one myself. The high was pretty minor and lasted maybe an hour before making me badly nauseous, shaky, and overwhelmingly sleepy. All in all, it was an unpleasant experience that ended with me having to bring a bucket to bed just in case.

AND YET. The day after, out of nowhere, I started craving it. I wanted another pill, even though i got sick from the first one and didn't even get much of a pleasure high. I kept thinking about it and whether a second one might be better, and why not try it and see, etc. I didn't dare take another, and the cravings disappeared after about a week, but it was so weird and such a crazy experience. That's how fucking powerful these drugs are; even when the experience was negative, some subconscious part of my brain clearly liked it and strongly wanted more. It was actually kind of scary, and I don't like to think of what might have happened if I caved and took a second pill. Maybe getting sick again would have gotten the cravings out of my head, but maybe not. It was just so surreal.

Tl;dr: I'm one and done with Percocet, thanks to an unhinged subconscious that doesn't care that I had a bad physical reaction. Three months later, I still feel like I stared into the abyss and backed away just in time.

Well, the temptation got the better of me, I just used again and I feel shit, especially since I had managed to stay sober for 3 weeks, in fact, I even thought about celebrating my month of sobriety with my best friend, but my weakness was joined the game: ')

I've had previous attempts to stay sober and this had been the longest and most successful.

I hate myself because I did not relapse due to an anxiety attack or something like that, it was just by simple temptation, and I know that this could be treated by doing some recreational activity; reading, studying, exercising and sports, etc, but even for that I am useless because I can not do even a recreational activity due to lack of motivation and severe trauma in doing recreational activities, even with simple hobbies.

Sorry, I just wanted to vent and ask for advice not to relapse anymore

I've been taking 40 mg Diazepam for 3 months every night. From then on I've been going down 5 mg every 5 days. This worked okay until I hit 20 mg. 

Now I've been on 15 mg for the past four days and I cannot function. My head is exploding, my chest hurts, I have a very strange and painful dry cough (?) and am nauseous. Also I feel like I am about to lose my mind like absolutely crazy mentally. 

Don't get me wrong, I have been asking two doctors which recommended an even faster taper I did not agree with.

Should I stay on 15 mg or go back up to 20 mg? Also can stimulants (like Ritalin) make the physical withdrawal symptoms worse?

It slowly crept up on me to the point where I had lost control. And of course lost an amazing girlfriend..I blamed all my problems on gambling and although I have a serious gambling problem,she knew there was something more going on.
When she left me I hit rock bottom and no matter how hard I tried she wanted me out of her life and thats wat was going to happen from her point of view.she had made up her mind! The weeks thats followed her leaving me left me completely broken and as we worked in the same building I had to see her often and watch as she completely ignored me and when she did look at me gave me the most horrible looks you can imagine. I felt as though I was stuck in the mud and couldn't get myself out,I turned to drugs and gambling to take my mind off things but ended up in a really destructive cycle that quickly turned into physical dependence. I had taken oxys  and heroine sporadically over the years before hand and was really surprised how fast I became dependant(1 to 2 weeks of everyday use).
When you become like this it tears down every bit of joy out of your life because the drugs soon don't work as they did before and all they really do is keep the sickness away.you are constantly broke and no matter how hard you try its nearly impossible to quit!
When I started on methadone it literally saved my life,no more sickness,no more pain but it doesn't stop the mental cravings and I think the reason alot of ppl never come off methadone is because they see it as insurance to not being able to score. 
In ireland methadone is 100% free but you are monitored by the clinic.every 2 weeks I have to go in and give a urine test. If your positive for opiates you are not sanctioned in any way. The main aim of the nurses is to stabilise u on methadone compared to heroine,so if u are positive they merely just incourage you to maybe up your dose and put you in touch with counsellors, if you have 4 negative urine results in a row the they will reward you with take home doses(only 1 per every 4 weeks clean) so over time its an incentive to stay clean but the visits to the clinic are also very important in your recovery because the nurses are so kind and caring. They incourage honesty and they will never sanction you because of it! I started off on 20mgs and went up as far as 60.im currently on 43 and take a supervised dose every day at my chosen pharmacy apart from Sunday which I take home with me on Saturday. The   staff in the pharmacy are also very kind and caring and dont look down on me at all so that also helps.
Sorry for such a long story!keep the head up any1 who understands my struggles,im sure im not alone!

He's had moments of sobriety but many dark ones too. Having spoken with him the past few days I definitely feel like there's some serious childhood trauma and some mental health battles he's been fighting. I know that he needs help, but he seems determined to continue getting high and he is not currently in a place where he'd willingly go. What I'm about to describe is kinda graphic but I literally don't know what else to do right now except writing this, stay awake to make sure he doesn't do anything rash, and look up recovery centers in his state.
Today he huffed almost an entire can of CO2 in his dad's garage, shat himself, came inside to take a shower, passed out with the water on. His contention is that he simply fell asleep and did not pass out. He also admonished us for calling 9-11 When we found him he was unconscious and not responsive. In the middle of the call he wakes up and says he's fine. That was clearly not true but I canceled the EMS at his request. My children were there and saw their uncle passed out. I really tried to protect them and failed. Wife and I both grew up seeing some weird shit and I've strived to keep that away from my kids. Tonight there was a giant explosive verbal argument between BIl, FIL and my wife that I also attempted to shield my kids from. After that, my BIL talked to his wife back home who informed him she was getting divorce papers signed tomorrow. I know he needs help, but I need help getting it for him. None of us in the family are in a great financial position to pay alot of money, but I know that he's sick and despite everything I love him and want him to get better. I am convinced that, deep down, he's a good person that is both in obvious deep pain while being adept at causing others pain. I want to do the right thing but honestly don't know exactly what it is and how to go about it. Can I get some guidance please? Sorry for the rant.

Looking for advice.,"TLDR; I’m trying to manage my intense mental restless from going cold turkey off 40-60mg Ritalin, taken for about a year. How long will it last and how can I mitigate it?

So I’m prescribed Ritalin for major depression and *possible* adhd. Basically before I started taking it, I couldn’t sit still at work and it was just this unbearable restlessness. I couldn’t hold down a job that didn’t involve constant movement and action (so no office jobs). Now at my current job (office job) I’ve been scripted Ritalin 10mg three times a day. Initially it was helping a lot. I could sit still and focus and get shit done. This was last June. 

However I’ve always had the issue of drinking like 400-600mg of caffeine with it through Red Bull’s and coffee. At one point a few months in, I got promoted to a different position that was more project-based as opposed to having like an inbox of stuff every day that must get out the same day. I also started working from home. About the same time I got bumped up to 20mg three times daily. For most of the time it’s been rather difficult to concentrate as the restlessness is intense. I feel the need to keep upping my dose of Ritalin to run away from the restlessness feeling. I drink about as much caffeine still too. Even when I’ve tried not taking the Ritalin I’ve only lasted a few days before I gave up to the restlessness and lack of focus and started taking it again. Currently I’m on 10mg three times daily but I usually go up to 40-60mg total (I have enough since I don’t take it on the weekends). 

Sorry about that long ass block of text, but I felt it was important pretext to my issue. I don’t think I have adhd so I was wondering how to endure the restlessness for however many days or weeks it will last from when I stop the Ritalin completely. For example, does CBD help? It’s not like restless leg syndrome, it’s more like a mental restlessness combined with fidgeting a bunch. Thanks for any help.",6,0

You can pretty much put any word you want in front of addict and it would be applicable. Alcohol, weed, opiates, stimulants, gabapenoids, benzo's, gambling, adrenaline, ect. I've had physical addictions to all of them where it applies, and broken those addictions in secret. Despite this, I always fall back, especially to stimulants and opiates. Stimulants because I live an unrealistically demanding life, and opiates because i'm actively watching everyone I care about, and all of my aspirations being destroyed while suffering from really severe ptsd. I was everyone's rock, and always showed up when people needed me. This aspect of my life eventually consumed everything else. My academics fell apart. I stopped having time to intern in labs, and then with covid and not having a degree, my family refusing to teach me to drive while actively harassing and attacking me for trying to learn elsewhere, getting a job is difficult. I started to take on serious debt from school and other expenses. These same people who's issues imposed onto my life are no longer there when I need advice or even someone to talk to. The worst part is I'm 21 now. I should be way too old to be complaining about parents or family, however the older I get, the more I feel this very strange chokehold on me they have, and the more I see how handicapped I've been. I literally can't exit the house without being pulled aside and essentially ambushed for information, and that has gone on even back when I was a complete straight edge. I wasn't taught or shown how to be a stable adult. The people I grew up around weren't either, and that is why half joined the army and the other half are working the street. I had no example, but I don't want to live this shitty meaningless life just going with the flow and doing nothing toward my goals. These same family members all tell me to sober up, telling me I should just figure it out without drugs, however they fail to realize, and I myself was in denial that I want to be high. I don't want to sit in an unstable, volatile situation sober with wings clipped. I want guidance on how to get out of that so I can go back to feeling content sober. Do you guys have any ideas? 

My realization that I needed guidance comes today after I casually overdosed on like 4 different drugs, blacked out, woke up with a BPM of 133, and then continued on about my day.

TL/DR:
I'm addicted to everything, suffer with ptsd, was not taught or exposed to stable adult behavior, stuck in an environment that I don't want to be sober in, and I want some advice on how to take life back into my own hands.",2,1

Now that that’s out of the way, my boyfriend confessed today he’s addicted to Percocets. First time we used was together. It was a horrible experience, we felt like shit and threw up all day. We could tell it wasn’t for us and we’d never use again. He got them from his friends who use on occasion for fun. 2 weeks later he took some with his friends and he felt awful again. I told him to stop taking because 1) it wasn’t even worth it, he felt like shit every time. 2) I told him addiction started that easily. He agreed and seemed genuinely uninterested after that. These events were about 2 months ago. Today he told me he’s been taking them every day for the past three weeks. I didn’t notice a thing. He chose to quit because he realized he and his friends were becoming addicted. He SEEMS very self aware like “I realized I’m becoming dependent and I’m scared of being addicted I’m quitting right now I’ll never do them again I don’t want to go down that path”. But I don’t know how realistic that is. Like can he be mildly addicted? Can you have the willpower early on to be clean that you legitimately stop? I’m prepared to do anything and everything to stop his addiction. But I’m scared of the road. I don’t know if he will relapse because of the horrible withdrawals he’s experiencing. I guess what I’m asking is, is it unrealistic of him to quit now and forever, can he be too far gone already, or is 3 weeks of addiction not that serious that he will recover.

My family were the type to not notice how they encourage stress in me so I'd vent out to my friends, but nobody noticed, they always covered me. The thing that bothered me was that no matter how much time I would spend helping them and other members, absolutely nobody came for me. It's like I didn't exist to them. I never bothered going to my parents cause they clearly don't help. They were the type to call me dramatic over trying to stop myself from having a breakdown or being scared that I could have an illness. They didn't really seem to care about my trauma and triggers cause when I tried telling them a few times, they did nothing, so the server wasn't doing any better for me. I couldn't even go out to try to get help because of quarantine and my parents don't wanna waste anymore time and money on therapy for me.

Whenever this happened, I tried not to spam vent and let nature take its course.

I couldn't take it anymore though, so I tried standing up for myself for once in the server, but I then got guilt tripped by the owner and one of the mods who CONSTANTLY denied help for me, so I instantly regret what I did so I begged them to forget this ever happend, but even after that, the suffering continued and nobody even tried noticing me, and I continued wasting my mental energy on them.

That was the first moment I knew I shouldn't be obsessing over this; the second one was when one of the other mods (this one actually knew I had feelings) had a breakdown and we wrote super long paragraphs for her, even going as far as to make a server DEDICATED TO HER to help her get better. These were conjured up by the same people who didn't listen to me standing up for myself and made things worse for me and I felt forced to be part of it. At the time, I didn't realize that it was making me feel angry and jealous because I started craving people to comfort me and I never got that, but I gave it to everyone else, nobody gave it to me. From there on, my intrusive thoughts and issues didn't get any better and this was the only server I could vent in. Most servers either didn't allow vents or did, but only a specific member can vent.

I then left the server for a break, but when I came back and vented when I felt I needed to, still nobody was there.  
Then one day on my mom's birthday, I posted vent art in the vent art channel about the issue, but when we came back from the resturant, STILL nobody tried acknowledging it and instead were active in other channels. I left for sure and never came back, but nobody acknowledged that either lmfao

This whole thing really messed with me mentally and I would constantly question myself if they really cared as much as I did for them, I still had trouble trying to reconnect with my parents cause they'd still judge me if I felt I was going into a panic because of trauma they put me through and wouldn't care if they triggered me. 

I then started joining other servers and I found a new comfort for them, but then I found this one server that really did give off vibes of the last server only this time they were actually being friendly to me and I was to them. I stayed in there because I felt I was coming back to my comfort zone which was that server, but I tried to restrain it cause of how bad it made me, but it wasn't all darkness and gloom. The server influenced my humor and ways of expressing myself so I started acting like that on other servers cause I found comfort in those positive aspects, but even then, it makes me miss the server still and I'd question if it's really best to go back or not, but I know no is the answer because I'm just letting myself become a punching bag again who apparently would hurt others if I stood up for myself. At the same time though, I get random fantasies of us being together and chaotic again like nothing ever happened and I really do miss that. I know I said I found a server that reminded me of the last one, so I know it's best to just stay there and embrace the positive ways the past one influenced me like my humor, but I couldn't shake the urge to come back to the original place, but no matter how much I come back, they'll still ignore me no matter what I do for them. In my heart, I feel they're still my friends and even with all this, I still really do care about them.

I really want to be happy, so I need to get over this obsession, but I'd also feel happy if I came back.",2,1

285,2021-05-12 13:04:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/natq9l/my_mothers_story_my_pov/,My Mother’s Story (my POV),"I want to preface this story by saying I am not sharing this story for sympathy or consolation. I have been wanting to share her story for a while, as a way to personally coupe with the events that transpired in late 2020, and decided this subreddit would be the best place to share, as it may shed some light on the dangers of addiction, while allowing me to maintain anonymity and give me an avenue in which to vent. This story will contain explicit content, and will, at certain points, deviate from addiction, as I have things to get off my chest. 

My mother’s drug of choice growing up was alcohol. During my toddler years, she began to drink socially with my grandmother on my father’s side. This seemingly innocent attempt at maintaining a social presence by ingesting alcohol set the stage for inevitable complications to come.

During this time, my mother was faced with emotional trauma that may or may not have contributed to her addiction, but for the sake of relevance, we will say she used the most convenient tool at hand to coupe with her grief.

Fast-forwarding through life, my mother was a wonderful and benevolent woman, who deserves praise for her generosity and kindness. There aren’t many people who I have met in my 24 years on this earth that can compete with her bewilderingly sweet personality.

With that being said, the amount of alcohol she ingested every night would heavily impair her ability to function socially which posed to be an intolerable attribute some days for those around her, including myself. This made those around her become very short tempered, and occasionally snap at her. These actions of those around her would subconsciously make her feel very unloved and ostracized, as she would begin to seek confirmation of love from those closest to her, during her hours of intoxication. Something that haunts me to this day is not granting her more affirmation, as she clearly needed it, but this was around my mid-teen years, and granting her love and affection was a difficult task to juggle with the hormonal volatility of puberty. Alternatively, I truly wish I would’ve taken more concern to her addiction, but we will get to that shortly

I joined the military at 19 years old, in December of 2016. My hormonal years were behind me, and now started the age of adulthood which brought distance between my family and I, physically and emotionally. The harder they pushed to maintain daily contact, the more I distanced myself. All of them, excluding my mother, realized this and allowed space for me. My mother, the determined and proud mother that she was, sought for daily contact with me, which could become an annoyance, but I eventually realized it was fueled by love and admiration. There were many times I would leave texts unread, and calls unanswered, but to my credit, there were a fair amount of days that I would respond and be a loving son.

2019 was the year things began to roll south. I do not know the true extent of what happened during this time, because I was juggling divorce and a deployment to the Middle East in retaliation to the aggression instigated by Iran on the oil tankers. My father later admitted in 2020, there were things that were kept from me to prevent me from worrying about my them. However, I do know my father was considering divorce in early 2019 as he was becoming tired of her addiction, but that became asinine in the latter part of 2019, because mom was beginning to show symptoms of liver complications. He couldn’t bare the thought of abandoning his wife of 20+ years in her time of need.

I first seen the impact drinking had on my mom when I came home on leave for the holidays at the end of 2019. She had lost a concerning amount of weight, her eyes had a yellow tinge, and there were scattered blemishes on the upper part of her chest that had the appearance of pimples. One thing that sticks with me is that my aunt was the first to show true concern. She pulled me aside while I was on leave, and told me that my mother was in dire need of help. She insisted that if she didn’t receive help, there was a strong possibility of death within a year. She continued to admit that she had begged and pleaded my mother to seek help, but she was met with hostility and denial by my mother. She also proceeded to tell me there were symptoms being kept secret from me, which included hematemesis (bloody vomit). This deeply disturbed me, but I foolishly brushed it off. I do take a morbid sense of comfort in hindsight though... as it was too late for intervention anyway. 

2020, the year we all will remember for the foreseeable future. This year chose to be an extremely challenging year for many of us, but will go down as potentially the most challenging year of my life. Omitting irrelevant information of early 2020, we will fast forward through the difficulties I personally faced during the infancy of the pandemic. Mom had actually dropped alcohol cold turkey during this time, and maintained sobriety for the majority of 2020, as she realized a liver transplant was going to be a necessary operation if she wanted to survive. 

The finale began in November of 2020, I knew my mother was having complications, but it wasn’t until I received an emergency phone call at work, that I realized the severity of her condition. Mom had developed a very serious full body sepsis infection, and was on her way to the hospital via ambulance. I became quiet distraught, and requested that my sergeants grant me leave immediately.

I arrive at the hospital in the early morning of the following day, and due to Covid restrictions, mom was only permitted one visitor a day during visitor hours. I eventually left Chattanooga, TN and drove to my parents home in north western Georgia.

I arrive at home, and my father greets me with a very long and concerning embrace. During this time, he explains the particularities of what had transpired in my absence. Mom had been receiving procedures called a paracentesis that were growing increasingly common for her. This procedure requires a needle to be placed in the abdomen to withdraw water from the body, because the body can’t expel the fluid on its own. This water causes her stomach to become distended giving the appearance of pregnancy. The procedure is apparently quiet painful, and causes a fair amount of agony on the patient. My father and I wrapped up the night with unrelated banter, and headed to bed.

I wake up the following morning, and get in the shower, so I could get ready to go visit mom for the second time. As I am showering I hear a gunshot go off. For some reason, despite being a fairly loud and a close proximity gunshot, I was not alarmed. That changed in about four seconds when my father began screaming for me. I threw my towel around me, and ran into the living room. What I found was flesh, blood, and bone. Due to unfamiliarity with my pistol’s peculiar mechanics, my father managed to accidentally discharge my pistol into his leg. I immediately rendered first aid, and called an ambulance. I managed to get the bleeding under control, but if this had happened after I had left, my father may have went into shock and bled out. Despite being a critical defense hollow point .357 sig round, he miraculously only blew out his fibula. The doctor’s thought he needed an airlift and amputation, but it proved to be unnecessary. He was transported to the same hospital my mother was at and received surgery to remove debris.

I spent the next couple of hours informing family members and cleaning the mess with a neighbor that saw the ambulance leave the driveway, and came over out of concern for my mother, as she too knew about my mother’s condition. My mother was eventually informed and this brought her great stress, but was pertinent information she needed to know.

She was discharged the following day, and I brought her home. She had some discomfort but was overall very happy to come home. I bought her food, and we arrived back at home, where she was greeted by our two very ecstatic dogs. A brief moment of joy came to an end when I realized she was profusely bleeding from her inner thigh, where the doctors had some sort of large needle in the femoral vein. I sat her down, and began applying pressure. I once again got on the phone with 911 and requested an ambulance. They arrived and insisted she return to the hospital for repackaging of the afflicted area. This caused my mother to break down, and instantly become very emotional and hostile. This act was one of the most difficult and empathy inducing displays of suffering I would see from my mother. She didn’t want to return to the hospital and it was very apparent.

I don’t know if you have ever experienced major grief in your life, but the human brain has a peculiar mechanism that will essentially discard and chronologically mix up minor events around the same timeframe of the source of the grief, but I will try to remember the best I can. 

The following few days were quiet worrying. The hospital initially took her back to package her up and send her back home, but they kept her due to an off balance of anatomical issues in her blood. These extended stays were introducing frequent drip bags and IVs which would cause her stomach to distend, which required a paracentesis that they couldn’t perform due to the original anatomical off balances they made her stay for. See where I am going with this? Any time she went to a hospital, she was caught in a triad of complications. 

They eventually sent her home right before my leave expired, but they couldn’t perform the paracentesis. I don’t remember why, but that’s how it happened. The night before I left I was awoken by a loud thud coming from my parent’s room. I ran in to find my mother face down next to the bed, weeping in pain. My dad was in a heavy sleep due to sleeping medication, but became conscious once I turned on the lights and vocalized my concern. Seeing this was one of the more eye opening and upsetting scenes I seen the whole time, including my father’s accident. It opened my eyes to the true nature of what was happening. My mother was growing weaker and deteriorating at a very rapid rate. 

I left from my “vacation” for a week or so, and one day after work, I received a phone call from my dad. He greeted me crying, saying he had “really really bad news” for me. He said mom had woken up confused with dementia like symptoms, not remembering who anybody was. She did not know who or where she was either. He immediately called an ambulance, and they transported her back to the hospital. The hospital said if they are unable to transport her to an alternate facility, that was better equipped to treat her, she would go into hospice at the hospital, and have maximum two weeks to live. 

I immediately called my leadership, and told them I was taking emergency leave that very moment. They agreed and I went on my way from Louisiana back to Georgia. 

I arrived, and was greeted at the hospital by my crying grandmother (mom’s mom) and said that she had entered hospice. This was around the time my body went into a numb state, and reality faded away.

There was no saving her.

We all agreed that we wouldn’t allow her to know that she was in hospice, to keep her from being scared in her final days. I proceeded to live in the hospital room on standby for my mother’s death through thanksgiving into December. During this time she was unconscious for the majority of it, due to the morphine and other drugs used to numb her pain in the hours of consciousness. There were days where she could maintain some semblance of consciousness, which we used to say our final “I love you’s”, and get them in return, but the majority of the time we were simply waiting for the unavoidable conclusion to her story. 

There was one day where she even “rallied”. A rally is an event in which a dying person gives the appearance of a full recovery shortly before they die, and becomes fully functional. This caused a split down the middle of the family. Half of us knew she did not have much longer. The other half chose to cling to denial, and accuse the others of deliberately marching her towards her demise by keeping her in hospice. 

On December 2nd, 2020 at about 6:17 am, my father and I was awoken by my distraught grandmother returning from a smoke break. We both looked at mom, and realized the time had come. I knew the night before hand that she only had hours due to a “death-rattle” she began to procure deep within her throat. All three of us gathered around her, and told her we loved her, and held her. Mom had a thousand-yard gaze that penetrated the ceiling. Her chest was heavily fluctuating as if she was gasping for air, but nothing was coming in or out, and she was unresponsive to anything we said. Seconds later, the breathing stopped, I walked over to my mother looking into the eyes of the woman that birthed me, and shut her eyelids for her... My mother was gone. The walk out of the hospital, leaving the remains of my mother behind was incredibly somber. Those around us had no clue of our loss, and we were greeted with outside air by chirping birds and casual bystanders. Days later, I was placing my mom in the earth at 23 years old. She was 45. 

Addiction is a powerful enemy to those it chooses to possess. It affects not only you, but those around you. If you are battling an addiction, take the time now to seek help, not only for your sake, but also the sake of those that love and cherish you.

I’ve got a little bit of a predicament on my hands. I am hopelessly addicted. To what exactly I don’t know, my friend put me into this cbd vape oil cus we were discussing how I was having trouble sleeping. The guy I was buying it from was kinda sketchy and definitely not a legit place (like authorised). But I figured oh well since I gathered cbd oil should be kinda harmless. Now the first red flag was that it made m high asf, which I am quite confident cbd does not do. But I quite liked it and it definitely helped me sleep. So as the dumbshit I am I continued, and bought another when that bottle was done, and another, and by the third one I was pretty much hooked. I hadn’t seen it coming just one day I ran out and the dealer wasn’t available and I freaked the fuck out. Got depressed as shit for the night, and couldn’t sleep at all. I got some the best day and was all fine again, that’s when I realised. Well that was four months ago and I’ve tried many times since to stop. Every time the same, I get depressed , can’t sleep and so on. I’m not noticing any physical withdrawal symptoms however . I would ride it out but am in my last year of high school.

She's a recovering alcoholic, after she developed neuropathy as a result of her heavy driving while I was away at college. She hasn't had anything to drink in a month now, and I'm really proud of her for that. Her mental health hasn't been the best, and she's been smoking more now. She used to smoke in the garage, but now she can't get there very easily and it's difficult for her to stay there to smoke so she smokes in the house now. I'm really uncomfortable with the second-hand smoke, and I've been trying to get her to quit my whole life. 

How do I get her to stop? I'm thinking of giving her an ultimatum that I'll move in with a friend over the summer if she doesn't stop, but I don't think I could actually leave. She needs me to prep her food for her, clean the kitty litter, and perform other daily tasks. 

I'm also struggling to get her to schedule her next doctor's check in. We're already a week late from when they wanted her back. I really don't know what to do here. I can tell she's resentful of needing my help and depending on me, and she really wants to do everything herself, but she just can't. She's been a wonderful mom for my whole life up until now and I want to help her but I don't know how, especially if she's not respecting my own health.",2,0

And I take 60 mg of Adderall XR a day (prescribed). I felt like absolute crap. I felt worse on red bull than when was addicted to cocaine a few years back.

Between the red bull and adderall, i lost a lot of weight. My doctor told me I was “withering away”. 

Out of all the various things I have been addicted to over the years, I swear red bull had me scared shitless. I’m a tattooer. I spend almost every night drawing, all night. I have 2 kids, so I was going to bed at 5, waking up at 7, and living like that for a loooong time. I NEEDED red bull to survive. To function, to be a human, to do my job well, to be outgoing.

I was terrified of not being able to produce to the standard that I hold myself to. The thing about red bull is that it’s so damn accessible and irresistible. It’s literally everywhere. And it always has deals like 2 for $5 and 3 for $6. So it’s being shoved in my face at any store.

Anyways, I had enough of feeling like a moldy food bin. Years ago, I quite cocaine cold turkey. I quit drinking cold turkey. I quit cigarettes cold turkey. 

So I can quit red bull cold turkey. It’s been easier than i thought. And the by-products of quitting have been much more fulfilling. I go to bed early. I wake up less groggy. I’m saving money. I don’t have sugar crashes.

Red bull may seem like a small thing to quit. But when I get addicted to something, I go all out, pedal to the metal, full blown obsessed. I don’t know why. There’s always something I’m filling a void with, one ofter the next.  

This is just a little encouragement, from having a lot of life experience:

Stopping an addiction takes baby steps. But baby steps are big steps, and the small freedoms that comes with baby steps are the motivation to keep going. It’s one day at a time, fighting your mind, filling the void of addiction with those freedoms. 

Separate yourself from the addiction. Try not to identify as your addiction. You are a person, you are not the addiction. I tell myself “THE addiction”, not “MY addiction.”

I suffer from debilitating constant chronic pain. Most mornings I can't even get out of bed on my own. So I'm in pain management. Well years ago I had a problem with being able to swallow my meds and not immediately throw them back up. But in order to even breath without screaming in pain I absolutely had to take my hydrocodone. So my husband trying to help suggested sorting it until I was able to swallow them again. It's been 5yrs now. How do I stop. I CAN swallow them now. But when I do it's like I didn't take it at all... I desperately want to stop. That's the only problem with them that I'm having. Well, I do take 1-2 more a day than prescribed but I told my Dr that I do that. But I've got to STOP THIS FUCKING HABIT!!!! PLEASE if anyone knows how I can stop this awful habit, I'd greatly appreciate the advice of ur willing to give it.

Update 5/13
Ok I'll just put this right in my post so nobody else preaches methadone to me again. I WILL NOT NOW NOR WILL I EVER USE METHADONE. For more than 1 reason actually. #1 being that I MIGHT TAKE THEM INCORRECTLY HOWEVER I DO NOT OVER TAKE MY MEDS EITHER. My method of ingesting/use is abuse but it's not an addiction. Yes I need to stop what I'm doing. But not stop my meds. #2 methadone isn't actually used for prescription hydrocodone. #3 I've had my own family and seen to many others totally shattered by the ""fix"" methadone was supposedly going to repair my BROKEN family. Instead methadone shattered it. 

There seems to be a serious common misconception about the safety of methadone. I was told in this thread that people on methadone don't OD when under a doctor's care when taking it as intended. But that just isn't true. Bcuz if it were my husband would still have a baby sister. I'd still have my friend. Our nieces would still have their mommy. Her parents would still have their little girl. 

My SIL (20F) was a recovering addict and had a small relapse where she'd been clean 8mo and then used 1x and went to get help. She was put back on methadone and given her dose right then. She was dead within hours or less of leaving that clinic. SO NO, NOBODY GETS TO TELL ME THAT METHADONE IS SAFE OR THAT NOBODY ON IT ODs WHEN UNDER A DRs CARE TAKING IT AS PRESCRIBED.",0,0

Of course you can’t compare it to other heavy drug addictions, but I feel since weed is getting more popular and popular (legalization etc.) a lot of people are building up a heavy addiction which can cause (mainly) mental problems.

I'm fairly new here, but I wanted to share my own experiences with addiction and recovery. I started drinking at about 10, smoking weed at 13, and doing speed at 15. By 17, I had dropped out of high school and literally the only thing I did was drugs. Honestly I was absolutely convinced that I was in too deep and that I'd have a few more years of getting high and then die on the streets, but then I decided to try to quit drugs and move forward. Now I'm in college getting good grades and in a long term relationship. I was very lucky, but I also didn't give up and I got better. I want to stress that I am 22 now and I relapsed 3 weeks ago. I still struggle with slip ups and cravings and I will never not be an addict. My point is, even if you slip up or think that you're in too deep, just keep pushing forward.

Sending good vibes to all of you!!!

I am going to be leaving the piece of shit city that I am currently living in to go back home and go to school there. I don’t plan on using alcohol or weed at home unless  in a social setting.

I just don’t see how I won’t be so bored. I want to take violin lessons and learn violin, I need to practice my math and programming skills and get better at those sorts of things. I want to enjoy the world.

The thing is alcohol and weed make everything way better. If nothing else it’s something to put me to sleep, but it always gets me through boring nights.

I always will think while doing something “man this would be way less monotonous and shitty if I was under the influence”

Often times I will just sit around all day waiting to be able to drink so I can enjoy myself.

How do you have an fun while sober when being drunk is so much better?

It seems that people who are addicts just have to turn to something like God to help them. Fuck that. Is that really all there is in this world to bring peace and happiness? I’d rather just be a drunk.

Or at least make me question whether sobriety is worth it. Here’s a small example. 

My joyfriend offered to buy us some art supplies today. They offered, because I’m trying to become sober, and today has been really hard for me. 
  (I fell off the wagon 3 days ago and was only keeping my cool due to some marijuana usage. Now I’m dry on both ends and irritable as a motherf***er.) 
We ended up getting some paints, and some 8X10 canvases to work with. Everything was going so well. We were both working on our paintings (in the sketch phase). 
  I landed on a fashion design figure-esque looking, blank face woman, and my joyfriend decided on baby yoda. We were taking our time making them, talking and then just enjoying each other in silence. It was nice. That was until they finished with their painting and I was still working on mine. There were a lot of fine little details on the dress so it was taking me longer.      
  Anyway, they decided to make a second painting- the same thing I was doing. Now in the grand scheme of things this is not a deal, let  alone a big one. However I can be competitive, and as of late I have been  drawing comparisons between myself and other people. It’s been taking a big toll on me. I feel like I’m behind in the game of life and I’ve just been pretty beat up about it.
  The idea of sitting next to someone working on the same thing (in a sense) was too much for me to handle. I was already catching myself looking at their sketch and comparing it to mine. Theirs was already much more polished looking, and it was very discouraging. I don’t know how to change or how to get better. I do know that I made a “half joke” to them about comparing the two if they were going to do something similar. So they even asked if it would be okay… and I reluctantly said yes. What was I supposed to do? Tell the person who bought the supplies: “No, I’m doing this. You can’t. It will make me feel bad.” I know that’s not healthy even though it’s the truth. So I slipped away and am now typing this. I’m about to play Xbox and think on this, but any advice would be much appreciated.

I've been an addict since about 16, started off with weed then alcohol, then till a couple of years ago I was using heroin, crack, alcohol and whatever else I could get my hands onto.. Till a lil after my birthday last year, I had an intervention with family and friends; then had given up all the stuff.

Mental health wise, my birthday has always been a period (since about 17) where things escelated and I'd be in and out of hospital. Be it a suicide attempt, overdosing or just blacking out and waking up there. So I guess its not abnormal  in a respect to be feeling this way close to my birthday. But almost always (now a few years back), I'd always throw a class party or just get fucked up with a small company of folk.

But yeah, the problem afoot is that all I really want todo for my birthday is getting a little fucked up with some booze and a mediocre substance (like ketamine, which I've always enjoyed with little to no problem whenever I used it personally). But I know its real bad, and my family etc, would hate to hear me even express it. Whilst being sober this past year, I've had a few relapses but managed to stay on track afterwards

I can't help but feel really quite depressed about it all, and even the thought about potentially doing it is some what calming. Though not long after a wave of guiltiness comes. My money situation, is helped by being controlled by a friend. So I don't really even have the means todo so anyways (at least not easily), but yeah. I suppose a lot of folk reading this can probably emphasise. I guess I just have a gut feeling of uncertainty of whether or not I want to or will. And it probably comes across as though I'm just trying to justify it..  But that is just the unfortunate nature of addiction though right; a yearning that never quite goes away.

Anywho, I appreciate it to anyone who may read this",34,0

Well, I fcked up... I stopped going to get my dose. Have blown off my counselor for a month now, using all day every day. 

I need to know how to write a letter to my employer explaining my absence without looking like a complete POS(which I entirely acknowledge that I am). I disclosed to my direct supervisor a tad of my struggles and that I was enrolled in addiction treatment. 
I haven’t been communicating my absences properly. She checked on me and I lied and said I have been in and out of the ER with a bad kidney infection. She seemed kind of understanding however they have put up with a lot of shit with me during this run I’ve had over the past year(missing work without good cause, not communicating absences properly, etc) She told me I need a note from a dr after missing 3 days stating I am ok to return to work. I’m supposed to return to work tomorrow. (I’m usually off Sunday and Monday) thing is, obviously I never went to the dr, so I don’t have a note. 

I want to write a letter saying I’ve been “going through some stuff” without again, seeming like a druggie POS. Question- due to disclosing my struggle with addiction and chemical dependency, do I qualify for ADA? As in if they try and fire me? I’ve read a little about it, but it’s not clear. I don’t want to pull one over on them, I want to be apologetic and let them know it’s not going to continue.. 

Any kind and encouraging advice is welcome and needed.

I really hope that this post does not come across as offensive, I'm just seeking a bit of advice from people who I feel would be most qualified to give it. 

For those of you that have recovered/are recovering, is there any particular exercises you do to help you prevent from consuming drugs? I feel I have a healthy relationship with alcohol, and it is not something I abuse, but when I begin to drink I simply cannot stop myself from moving on to further narcotics. 

As I'm sure you're all very familiar with, it has an adverse effect on my mental health as already I suffer with anxiety and depression. I simply don't know how to stop, and it is a real problem as I am part of a culture where very heavy drinking is the norm even at family events or casual friend meetups. Maybe I should completely go sober? Or perhaps there are tools I can use while drinking alcohol that will prevent me from becoming tempted towards hard drugs?",1,0

From 8th grade to this year used just about everything you could. Mainly weed first into drinking into coke molly and acid and about every stimulant I could get my hands on. Mid November 2019 I stopped one morning because I looked at what I was about to do an realized just how fucked what I was doing was. It just hit me I was sitting in my truck before class about to get fucked up like almost every day that month and it hurt. I didn’t go to class I just sat there for about an hour and a half before going home and breaking down. 

After that I was clean the pandemic came and I dealt with this massive depression. It wasn’t easy to be clean but it was an on off switch essentially. The hardest part was that normal life makes me miserable. I work construction and it hits me like wtf am I doing this is what I chose to live for?? 

Fast forward to this November 2020 I started using again. It slowly spiraled again from smoking with rock climbing friends to meeting old friends again to get high to me using coke and adderall to get through each day. I had two scary “”overdoses”” big quotes on that because I don’t think it was immediately life threatening but I got super fucking sick and definitely gave myself a really bad fever mixing molly and coke. Then I started shrooms again new years and had the worst trip of my life.

That ended that. I finally went to my family. I had my aunt rescue me that night and came clean about everything. So again I’m not using but I’m miserable again. I wake up for what. I’m working busting my ass all week and for fucking what. It’s not hard and I make more than enough for my age but I’ve got no reason and most nights I spend lying awake hoping I go peacefully at night from a stroke or some aneurysm just something that’s not my fault so my family doesn’t deal with that.",3,1

I spoke with my brother 31 every single day via Facebook Messenger. He last messaged me / ""saw"" my messages on the morning of April 26, and never responded or ""saw"" another message again. Between April 26 and May 5, I started to get really angry. It was pretty typical of my brothers to not respond to messages (they only communicated via FB and did not own cellphones) and it was always impossible to plan events or anything like that with them. They were endlessly unpredictable and impossible to communicate with and get a hold of. Usually, when they went ""dark"" like this, is meant they were using. However, I didn't really suspect anything. I was just insanely frustrated as my Dad and I were trying to get ahold of them to plan a BBQ for my mother for today, Mother's Day. After not hearing anything for several days, I told my boyfriend that I would have to go the ballistic route which I had employed a couple times in the past and just drive over to their apartment and knock on the door. I basically said to him if they didn't respond to me by the end of the night on May 5, I would just go over there. I am really glad I didn't.

The thing is - our family had been led to believe that both these boys had been clean for about 2 years. My brother 31 had recently completed suboxone treatment. Last summer, our family had a big BBQ party to celebrate his first year of sobriety and I won't lie, it was one of the most fun and happiest days of my entire life. After years and years of pain and suffering and worry caused by my brother's lifestyle, I finally felt as though we were out of the woods, our family was going to be a complete family again, and my parents and I finally let our guards down. Why would we have to keep them up anyway? Both our boys were clean, and swore they'd never go back.

Anyway. During the period between April 26 and May 6, I definitely had the thought that they might be using again, because it had been quite a while since the last time I had experienced a lack of response from my brothers. We talked every single night to discuss that evening's episode of TimCast IRL, or the Tim Dillon Podcast (among many other podcasts), or the rise of DOGEcoin, or music, or happenings in the world. I was pissed off the first night he didn't answer me. I was worried by the second night. I noticed that he hadn't been on FB in a while and that was not normal for him as he was ALWAYS on FB. My first thought was, ""hey, maybe they finally found a job!"" My brothers (who lived and worked together - they did literally every thing on Earth together) had been out of work since the very start of the pandemic, and had been trying to get back to it. I got to enjoy that thought for about a day. I realized the next day that there's no way they wouldn't have told me if they had gotten a job, and if they didn't tell me, surely my Mom would have. We were very invested in their health, recovery, and day-to-day lives. But still our guards were down. After like 15 years of true and honest to God chaos, we had finally let our guards down. I started to wonder if they were using, because they hadn't answered me or my Dad. I started to get very angry.

I suppose my parents must have also had a premonition, because on the morning of May 6, they decided to drive over to their apartment. The window to their 3rd story apartment was open, and they yelled and yelled up to it (we didn't have any other way of entering). My Dad told me that he already knew before they started yelling. They called the police, and sure enough, both of my brothers were located deceased in their beds in the apartment. Their bodies were badly decomposed as they had been lying there since April 27 - over a fucking week.

I will not try to describe to you what receiving that phone call was like. I was having a great morning at home - working, as I've been working at home since March 2020, doing some chit chat with my friends online. I booked my vaccine appointment for my boyfriend and I (which I had texted my Mom about earlier, when she was in the car on the way to the apartment). Then at about noon, my Dad called. Somehow I already knew what that call was going to be. But I will never, for the entire rest of my life get it out of my head,

""SurvivalistTales . . . 31 and 29 are dead.""

And here I am now on May 9, Mother's Day, the day we were all supposed to be together laughing and enjoying and celebrating our dear mother, with my life in utter fucking ruins, without the two people I love more than life itself. My parents suffering the most excruciating pain that a parent can know, and believe it or not, they have not lost 2 but now 3 sons in their lives. We had an older brother that died as a child to leukemia. Now they have lost all their sons. The worst thing a parent can ever endure has now struck again, as they lost two fucking more.

I won't go on and on about the unbearable pain, the insane loss of both my brothers, my family, and how I cannot imagine how I am going to live in this world without them. But I will go on about the following:

The medical examiner's provided us with interesting information about brother 31. He was found with a lighter in one hand, and a rolled up scratch ticket in the other. I am extremely innocent with regards to drugs, and I have no clue what that would have been, but we won't receive a toxicology report for at least 6 months, apparently. They said that he died instantly, because the autopsy revealed that he was actually already in the process of dying a slow death due to a severely enlarged heart. They said the enlarged heart was caused by extensive drug usage, likely cocaine. But I have since learned from his friends after his passing that he consumed all sorts of drugs I never imagined: meth, crack, cocaine, ketamine, GHB, heroin, and I have learned that he specifically sought out fentanyl. Our family was always led to believe that he was ""only addicted to heroin"" and I dunno, somehow that made it better. I won't be passing this extra information on to my parents. But the sad thing is, no matter if he had truly been clean, we were about to lose him anyway. The drugs had already ravished his body to such a point. His liver was also failing. He was not aware of either of these things.

The medical examiners would not provide us with details about brother 29's death. While they went into detail about 31, they were not so forthcoming with 29. I've received a couple of messages from their friends asking me whether or not they died simultaneously, or if 31 passed and 29 discovered his body and decided to take his own life. I think their intuition is correct. Their friends told me that the boys had a ""system"" for their drug usage, where one would watch the other consume their drug and wait before proceeding with using it themselves. Considering that 31 died instantly, I am unfortunately led to believe that this is likely the case. And if you knew these boys, you'd know that there was simply no way, no version of reality, in which one could live without the other. They were cosmically linked. I can live without them, as unimaginable as it sounds, but there's simply no way that they could live without each other. Sadly, our family doesn't get to hang on to the quiet comfort of knowing that they both passed at the same time. We now have to accept the possible horrible reality that 29 had to endure the worst imaginable pain, and had to decide to end his life instead of endure it. How fucking ridiculous.

I am writing this because the pain is very fresh, and I feel fucking weird in this new world where I exist and my beloved, wonderful, blessed brothers do not. There is nothing that is ever going to make this okay. I feel rage, resentment, helpless, confused, and a sorrow that I could never have imagined. I can hardly even think about what my parents must feel. But I want you to know that it is NOT SAFE for you to consume these drugs. You may think you are safe after 2 years, but YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT DAMAGE YOUR BODY HAS ALREADY SUSTAINED. There is no safe way to do this. It is NOT worth it. Nothing on Earth will ever be worth it. Think of this family of 5 now widdled down to 3 and how we are supposed to exist for the whole rest of our broken lives. Is it worth it?

I won't claim to understand addiction. I have no fucking clue. I spent most of my life feeling resentful and at times even kind of scared of my brothers for their addiction. It just made no sense. We were a happy family and came from a prosperous, stable, supportive home. Our parents are fun and happy people who gave us a good life. We suffered no amount of dysfunction or abuse or like, anything bad. I'm so fucking innocent even at 33 years old - I've never even lost someone until now. But I assure you, I have now lost all remaining innocence, and I'd give literally anything to have it all back.

Don't do it. Don't do it. Please, don't do it. If you want reasons why not to, just imagine your mother and father on their knees on the floor screaming in pain. Imagine the police finding your 10 day old decaying body lying in your bed in your apartment with your dead brother who took his own life in the other room. Imagine your cat trapped in the apartment with you, for 10 days with her owners dead and likely without access to any food (imagine) or water. Imagine that your sister will never ever ever ever get her imagined versions of these images out of her head. Every time I close my eyes, I see it. I didn't even see it, and I am so thankful neither my parents and I did, but it doesn't mean it's not there in our imaginations.

If you or anyone here needs to talk or anything - message me. I am dedicating the rest of my life to addiction awareness and advocacy. I've learned now that my brothers were never clean of drugs. I don't know how I can ever forgive them.

My boyfriend passed away two months ago from an overdose, we moved across country to be closer to his brother and their family. The first week I noticed we lived together he was nodding out in the bathroom standing up, but then popped back up and acted fine. About a month later I rent a room, and he stays with his brother. Things escalated quickly, but his brother ended up kicking him out he ended up on the street our relationship was becoming shit. He was very depressed, but anyway his family basically shut him out and ‘tough love’. So I began to be there for him and I visited back home and let him use my car when I was gone and I come back he admits that OD’d in an elevator and someone found him, but of course I freak the F out and scream and tell him this is running my life and his. Remind you all of his family just stopped helping him. We moved there and he lost EVERYTHING, I feel like he literally was screwed so bad and here I am. 

His past he’s had about 9 overdoses from what I understand he was taking OxyContin and would snort heroin if he couldn’t find oxy. He was 31. 3 weeks after the first overdose he died at the same hotel. Someone who was with him that night said he was really depressed and said he was giving up and now I am wondering if it suicide if the tough love was just too much for him. I feel like I killed him with being so mean to him and I was scared for him but I just came across probably nuts. 

I know what is done is done, but I feel like this is my fault he didn’t really want to move probably bc of his active addiction, but he never really expressed he wanted to be sober. He was such a loving soul I didn’t really realize his parents gave up also. I feel responsible for his death and me being a bitch. I guess I’m here to say, did I mess him up? I felt so betrayed and I know he felt like that with me too. Was he into deep? Ugh I’m just feeling horrible about this shit. Was he just not ready to be sober? Tough love fucking sucks and now he’s gone.

She needs time to think but it looks like we are continuing. How do I deal with my past addiction impacting my future like this?,"I’m 23 and was addicted to pain killers and heroin at 20. I had a fucked up childhood. I was constantly beaten as well as emotionally abused. My brother killed himself in front of me with a shotgun. My girlfriend at the time was an addict and she got pregnant twice and we had two abortions. Her and I just drifted from different homes trying to find a couch and drugs and sex were my only comfort. It was a life not worth living. She overdosed once and nearly died but a few days later she started using again so I took my bag and the car and left. I wrote her a note and I went to a different state and checked into rehab. 

I got out of rehab and I went to school and I got my LPN and I plan on going back to get BSN here soon. My life is great now. I’m three years sober and although it’s a continuous fight I am very confident I will stay away from it everyday. I cut contact with everyone from my past life and I started new. I have friends now who I have told about my past and they celebrate who I am now. I told my girlfriend eight months into our relationship and she walked away for a while. I nearly lost her because of my past. 

I told her nearly everything I mentioned here but I also told her how I am committed to her and I see a long term future with her and want to be with her and she started crying and said ok but she needs time to think. Right now she told me she still loves me but she’s adjusting to who she knows I am now and she said she had no idea anything about my past and it’s a shock. The abortions freak her out and she says I can relapse. I just want to do everything I can not to lose her. How do I deal with this?",3,0

I have been a smoker for the past 5-6 years basically since highschool when I saw a lot of kids smoking and I decided to try it myself,unfortunately I was hooked immediately. 
I love the smell,the taste,the stress relief and a somewhat positive vibe.

8 months ago I was pushed into quitting smoking by my ex which didn't worked out since it was not my decision but 6 months ago I decided to do it.
Many people write why they want to quit on their pack and this may sound cliche but I writed ""Jesus Christ resisted temptation, can you?"".
For the first 2 days i felt really bad,bad breathing, no energy,no joy and on the third day I decide to throw the pack and everytime I would feel the urge to smoke I would think about what I writed on my pack and my urges would go away.

I started running,swimming, eating healthy, studying, reading;basically quitting smoking make me the best version of myself yet.
Just don't forget an old saying that we have here: ""Smoking and drinking are no friends of sexual life""

This was a strange post indeed,if you have any questions please tell.",8,0

Yes, it’s a stupid addiction.","I’ve been addicted on and off to Benadryl for some years now, well honestly I’m just an addict with whatever I can get my hands on that doesn’t give me death vibes, but after developing health anxiety I’ve been too scared to become a 2-L-wine-a-day alcoholic again, too scared to smoke weed because my anxiety revolves around heart health and it gives me panic attacks, and so I’ve mainly turned to Benadryl for the sleepy buzz I get off of it. I’ve been drinking on and off this week because I quit Benadryl last Monday, but I’ve been craving it hard again after a relationship break, a lot of my addictions come from my body and mental discomfort in daily life and let me tell you, I’m definitely going through both right now. At my peak two years ago, I was taking doses of 350mg Benadryl, laying down, waiting for it to kick in, topping it off with another 150mg, falling asleep, and waking up in the middle to take another 350mg a few hours later. Basically repeated this all day until I had a heart scare, cut down to 150mg a day which is pretty low, but from October until now my tolerance had been kicking in and I was going back up to 450mg a day which was giving me panic attacks, wondering if I was going to damage myself or end up killing myself somehow. Honestly, it seems stupid as shit but in one way, I’m kind of grateful for my panic attacks these days because I used to be extremely reckless with the drugs I took. Anything I could get my hands on. 10 ambien, a line of heroin, a whole pack of triple C’s, suboxone, tramadol, half a 5L box of wine, so many blunts and cigarettes a day I coughed up black shit constantly. The panic attacks and I have a love hate relationship. It’s like having my mom beat my ass as a kid when I did something wrong. It hurts and I’m scared of it, but it’s enough to keep me in line for the most part. But I miss being able to have something take me out of the moment. Alcohol just gives me headaches and I’m too scared to drink enough to blackout, Benadryl made me sleep, but once I passed 200mg the panic attacks started. Jesus Christ I’m just rambling now.",2,0

I really hope my story is readable since im slavic and all my english is self-thought, pretty please Beautiful Stranger, just bare with me, ok? 
Alright, so right now me, 21, & my Gf, 20, both opioid addicts(with pretty big stash, so its not a worry srvival-wise really), are staying in my female friend w benefits' apartament. Gf just ran away from home and im, most likely, just about to, since my parents appearently just found a syringe or some shit in my room after serching it, as advised when getting in touch with Gfs parents, who told em that she ran away to get high with me, because, as far as they are concerned, that is the only thing we have ever been doing togerher (1,5 yrs that is). ""We have to talk..."" is what i heard from my mum over the phone yesterday, yet i really dont feel like talking about me being anything else than a fnctioning addict, trying to help my Gf with getting a job in a new city and taking care of her having a roof to stay under, until first or second pension of hers that is.

Girlfriend, lets call her Sally, just ran away from an extremely abusive household. Shit that has been goin on there has her mentally scarred for life, i guess, and im not exaggerating, dont really want to go into nasty details, but trust me, ive seen 2 much of those sick people and have also been greately affected by them, in very negative ways that is: a few months of depression now & then and increasing greatly my daily doses over last 2 months, from below average [40-80mg oxy/day] to moderately high [oxy200-300mg & morphine 200mg], especially considering im lanky 5""7 slavic male weighting about 100 lbs. That is litterally the only instance, in my 3 years of daily usage, of a life situation that caused me enough stress and pain to actually make me numb it down with drugs, which oreviously were a habit that i was very very very careful to not to let escalate like that. I also swithed to needle during this time which cosused me quite a lot of problems, so naturally i am in a process of kicking the iv ROA (it being for now only ~20% of my igest.)

When it comes to my family, thay are honest folks, who are truly concerned for me, but we are both very much aware of the major differences that make any real agreement between us impossible, forcing us to constantly compromise and just tolerate shit that we kinda hate each other for. Contriary to a situation in our house couple years prior, all the negative shit is felt mostly just in our heads tho. Some months ago I opened up about the abuse going on in Sallys house, since her parents were calling mine shortly before sending Sally off to a rehab in january and having to tell my folks ""all about these fucked up & lost kids of ours"". I had to defend myself from a bunch of lies, which wasnt hard, since there really wasnt anything that anyone could pin on me & the majority of claims were, straight up, made up or delusions of borderline-schisophrenic mind of Sallys Mom, BTW whos guts has became the most heted ones i have ever came across.[periodt.]. Anyways, the situation this time is different, there is no way of me just getting along with my parents by talking my way through. 

I have to take care of Sally and she cant come through my folks house now(which we initially planned before she headed my way, shit hit the fan when she was halfway there) and im really hasitant to come back myself now, fearing forced rehab, police, or whatever else may prevent me from just taking my work/uni laptop and some shit of mine before getting back ASAP to the apartament we are staying now with my Fwb. I feel really bad for not really talking to my parents, i know its childish, but they did promise me in january, after we straightened up the chronologically first drama regarding Sallys parents, to never contact or answer these fucking people again. Im about to call my Mom tho to tell her im gonna come pick up some of my stuff and get out for a couple weeks until they cool off a bit. Oh, and of course mention that im not about to hurt myself or anything similar, which is rather true considering im not getting high since march, just avoiding sickness really. My plan feels super raw and im very nervous about the next day, as well as each and every one after that, but im still really glad that Sally is out that psychological slaugterhouse of a household, not so much though when i think about losing my family, which is kinda certain - my parents will tell the rest and it will be the worst version imaginable.

If You have read the whole thing, congrats and thank You so much! I would very appreciate all and any advice or just some words of ecouragement, positivity :)

I need to somehow convince him to go to treatment but he doesn't even think that it's the dope causing this to happen to him. He doesn't even think that theres anything happening to him. He thinks it's real, which is so confusing to me because he used to be so grounded and such a solid person.",3,0

My father quit using meth when he met my mom, until after I was born. He relapsed so my mom took my older sister and I and left. That began a revolving door of leaving him and then being convinced to come back for 
the next five years. Then he got it together and sobered up. He was sober for four years when my mom gave birth to my brother. He was the best dad for those four years. I almost wish he hadn’t been, because it gave me a glimpse of what life could’ve been. Months after my brother was born my dad spiraled and hasn’t recovered. My dad became a shell of who he was, he would fly into an abusive rage or just disappear all together. When my sister turned 16 she started following in his footsteps. She started with meth before falling deep into a heroin addiction. She pushed me further and further away and I clung to her so much harder. I was clinging to the family I thought we were. My sister and my father pitted my mom against each other until my mom finally broke. She was admitted to a mental hospital and I was left with my dad and little brother. I tried to protect my brother and shield him from the mess our life became. Right after I turned 18 my sister ended up on the run for stealing checks and my dad ended up in prison. Mom got better and she found herself again. She’s off all her medications and has found an amazing boyfriend. I haven’t spoken or seen my dad since he got out of prison in 2016. My sister is still wanted and hasn’t returned to our state since 2015, but my mom, brother and I felt like we were finally healing. Until last year my brother was caught with some cocaine and marijuana. Over the last year he has been in drug court, he graduated in April and is now three months from being 18. With almost 300 sober days, he was doing so good. He graduated high school, enrolled in community college classes for welding and has a job. My mom went on vacation this past week and left my brother with me. I noticed his behavior was weird. He wasn’t coming home when he said he would. He would get very defensive when I asked where he was. Then I found out he quit his job and he dropped out of school. He was using his phone in the seat in front of me so I looked and he was asking someone on his Snapchat how much a gram was. So I asked him about it and he freaked out. He screamed and blamed our dad and said he didn’t care if he lived or died. He told me I couldn’t understand and yelled a lot of painful stuff. He took off and hasn’t come back.
I have been here left holding the door for the three addicts in my life. I think it’s time to just close the door. I am so tired of this life. I am tired of constantly worrying if they are okay. I am sick of driving around all night to find them just to make sure they are alive. I can’t do the lies anymore. I feel bad for my brother because I was more forgiving with my sister. I was younger and had a bigger, less broken heart then. But I have been doing this for the last 27 years of my life and I don’t think I have any compassion left to give him. I am just so tired of it.",3,0

It makes me numb, careless and not a worry in  the world. I don´t care what happens to me or anyone in my surroundings. Finally a empty shell, which is such a relief. For the first time im not all over the place. Not as many suicidal thoughs, but sometimes they still appear.

So he spent the day with me today, and he kept track, so apparently i take 1mg about every 1.5 hours which adds upp to alot per day.

I don´t want to quit these pills since i´ve struggled with bpd and suicidal thoughts for years, and now it´s finally under control-

But he just got upset at me and said that if i do not stop taking them we can not continue the relationship.

SO eather me (a person with bpd so obviously super scared of losing someone) keep taking the pills and just be an empty shell with nobody in my life to love, or be loved by. 

Or i stop taking them and start self harming and thinking about suicide 10h a day.

And i´m ´´high´´ writing this post, because i got extremely anxious and im flooded with suicidal thoughts. 

So to sum this up, no matter what i do i´ll just end up dead.. Better to get it over with sooner rather than later i suppose.",2,0

Alcohol or video games or tv/movies.,"I’m a very angry and depressed person. I play video games hours on end to dull my mind and avoid the present reality. When I can’t play video games I drink, a lot, to help dull my mind and calm me down. I watch TV/movies to avoid my responsibilities and help dull my connection to present matters. When I’m increasingly stressed, agravated and frustrated, I drink and play games or watch TV or all at the same time. I quit alcohol 4 months ago and then the increasing demands at work stressed me to a point that when I came home I had a temper tantrum and chewed out my wife unnecessarily — which in turn caused me to feel sad and depressed about my actions so I went ahead and got a bottle of whiskey, ultimately destroying my sobriety in the process. I can’t stop as these have become a need in my life and without them I cannot control myself and my anger and my depression and/or my stress/anxiety. I don’t know what to do.

I need some advice because other people are worried about me. I don’t even know if it counts as an addiction. 


I’ve (36f) had headaches and migraines all my life and the only medication that has ever helped is ace. I began taking Treo when I was about 10 years old and have always been happy I never needed stronger medication like my relatives who really suffer. 
2 tablets of Treo and I’m fine unlike my aunt or brother who suffers for days and are bedridden. Only I’m on antidepressants, have been since I was a teen and will be til the day I die and the main side effect is head aches. 
So I take Treo, two in the morning and two at night to combat it and it works perfectly, have for 10+ years. 
But ace itself is addictive and if I don’t take it I get a really severe headache way worse than the side effects. 
So I’m stuck in a loop I can’t get out of. I need it to cure the side effects of my life saving medication. 
Changing that is not an option. I’ve tried taking less (halfheartedly) but it’s in my muscle memory by now and it’s not an conscious decision I make. It’s just an automated process by now.  
So what do I do now? Continuing on something that works or listen more on the people who worry?",1,0

I have never been in this situation until now so i’m not sure what the ‘appropriate’ steps to take for the following would be..

My family isn’t good at communicating. we aren’t perfect, but we grew up together within the same house, my mom, aunt, uncle, cousin(f), younger cousin (m), and myself. My female cousin got into the wrong crowd when in middle/high school and i’ve been told this is when it all really started happening (I can’t go into extreme depth due to lack of full knowledge, but i know enough). she ultimately became hooked on pills and eventually got pregnant. the baby’s daddy is involved and he’s been a great dad, the family supports her and her kids and everything. She stopped doing drugs and pills while pregnant (thankfully) but started back afterwards. she was on “Za-Zas” and was apparently taking around 5 of them, a day, for years. She has started recently falling asleep everywhere, including behind the wheel, and smoking a cigarette within her house. she is currently with her “high school sweetheart” who is a HUGE enabler. huge enabler. he will flat out buy the pills for her instead of paying for a bill that’s due. then go and rant to someone else about her being hooked. Idk if it’s because he wants her to be with him, or if it’s *just* her being addicted. 

I was never told she was on any type of drug or pill, last year (during the unemployment time from rona) i lent her $500 for bills. i had it and i’d do anything for those kids. she payed me back all but $125, because she spent it on pills. 

Last Christmas (Dec. 2020), younger cousin (m) was told by her that she wasn’t sure of how she would pay for one of the kids christmas presents that were on lay-a-way. he lent her money to pay for it (total was around $40). they stopped at a gas station (for a couple drinks, he paid) and she spent all the money on pills, in front of him. he hasn’t given money since. Later that night she went to her mom and talked about the christmas lay-a-way and she ended up going and paying it out right. didn’t give her a dime. 

The family, including myself, we are not sure how to fight this. we’re worried for the children’s safety, worried for her health and safety, worried that her “fiancé” is  ultimately going to kill her due to buying their pills. 

For families, or people, who have gone through similar situations- i need advice on what we can do.",0,1

While I was grounded, I managed to smoke a couple bowls of weed for the first time in 4-5 months. This happened last week. I was never caught, and faked the drug tests my parents make me take. I didn't think much of it as it's 'only weed'. Today I got in an argument with my mom about drugs which brought me to realize the changes I've undergone in less than a year. Anyone read Catcher in The Rye? My American Literature teacher broke it down for the class, and I'm continually reminded of Holden's ""loss of innocence"". This is the day I truly felt the significance of what weed and drugs had done to me. I felt horrified at the changes I had undergone and my 'loss of innocence'. Even though I believe it's absurd weed is illegal, I genuinely believe it's blown my life of track. When I relapsed, I felt the pang of guilt that I was seeking immediate gratification, as the next day the high would be completely irrelevant and useless. I feel alienated not only from my friends now, but also my family. I feel like they don't care about my mental health and they're trying to squeeze the drug mindset out of me. It's impossible - I'm going to have to live with this for the rest of my life. I haven't tried anything too serious, but I have ventured farther than weed and even acid. Not a day goes by that I don't think about weed. It's my drug of choice. And I wish I could get it out of my head. I feel like my entire course of life has been redirected because of it, and I don;t care about things as much as I used to.

Sorry for the rant. I need help. Advice, pointers about NA, and support are much appreciated. Hope this reaches some people like me and who have been through this. Right now I'm cutting ties with the friends I used to do drugs with. All the good times I've had and their continued use are too much of a trigger. Thanks for listening to my ted talk yall.",30,0

I work with many people who see recovery as a battle of fighting away temptations on the daily, only to reach the next 24 hours of sobriety; I think this viewpoint is short-sided. Recovery is just as much about the destination as it is about the journey, a vision towards what could be a greater tomorrow for us is the starting line of this marathon of our new lives. When we make the promise to stop, we have good intentions…but we don’t always have a good reason. Taking steps forward one day at a time is the only practical way about proceeding in recovery, but what are you walking towards?

In this open talk, I share a candid perspective on my process of recovery and the mindset that helped me achieve the success I have reached so far. If this content brings you value, share this to anyone who may be in their own journeys or who have an interest in the subject matter.

It's a bit of a long and slightly absurd story, so don't feel obliged to read on since this is also a bit of a curated diary, but I'm not keeping you out either ;)  
\_\_\_  


I started smoking weed early on during my undergrad, mainly socially with friends, who were always the ones to go out and buy it, I'm not really street-savvy like that (and I didn't know about the dark net then) and it was just a little thing. Every now and then, I would ask friends to get a little bit extra for me, I'd hand them some money and be set for a good while: while I'd smoke joints when I was with friends, I really hate the smell and taste of tobacco in my mouth, so early on I found alternative ways of getting it in my system: 

  
My friend who always got us weed from somewhere is a chef in his day job. We were in high school together and basically learned how to cook together, even before he made our hobby his job, and we still regularly meet for awesome cooking nights with home-made but high-class food. Together, we figured out how to decarb weed, how you had to prepare it so it would have best effects and we made some AAA class millionaire short bread; short bread, chocolate and salted caramel, damn those were good and to this day probably the strongest high I'd ever had lol.

  
Another friend introduced me to what he called a gravity bong, not sure if that's the technical term. Basically, you cut a hole in a bottle, punch some tiny holes in aluminium foil, and when you light some weed on the top while also letting the water in the bottle out through the hole at the bottom, it would suck in all the smoke and you could then inhale it all in one go. Not the most social way to smoke weed, but it really gets the job done, you probably need 1/10th of the weed you would put in a joint and much less than even edibles, so with both this and smoking from pipes, I could really make weed last a long time.

  
I really started smoking on the regular when I was doing an internship at a company. Two pieces of information are important in this context:

1) I do feel the effects weed, but a big part of the effects is different for me than a lot of other people: I might be a little bit off on the neuro-scale, could be considered a very mild ADHD or sociopathy, but the important thing is: in moderation, weed actually makes me more switched on than switched off, I actually get more focused, I feel like I can get off my ass easier and work out better when having some weed in my system. In the late stages of my addiction, I would also particularly seek out strains of weed that are said to work particularly well with ADHD, depression, etc.   


2) I'm not a very career-oriented person. I'm very happy to work and I want to make a positive impact through the things that I do, but like many people nowadays, I have the feeling that the current system we have today isn't working and that as humans, we are hurdling towards a situation that we can't really control anymore (side note: ironically topical to this whole thing I'm writing here).  


These two things meant that I wasn't having a very good time in a corporate environment, and because of that, I found a lot relief in weed; it wasn't much in the beginning, maybe a whiff during lunch break every other day or so, slowly becoming a bit more , and I had some friends that while not heavy potheads would happily share a pipe at a movie night. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't bad at the job I was doing, I got a pretty flawless letter of recommendation in the end and I was given quite a bit of responsibility for an intern, but something just didn't feel right, I had this constant feeling that I wanted to get out of this situation, which is why narrowing my senses a bit with weed, while also benefiting from the focus that that narrowing resulted in, was such a draw for me.

Soon I realized that I was going to have to get another supply stream, because studying in a different town, I couldn't rely on my friend; also, I didn't want to travel and risk being pulled over or checked in public transit, weed is not legal where I live. My first plan was to grow my own weed on the roof of my building:  I was living in a historical building then, which had a unrenovated attic that was barred with a padlock - but whoever put the hinge on the wall was a bit of a intellectual breadstick and attached it with philips screws instead of other types that are harder to remove - it would take me all of 12 seconds to get it out, I'm pretty good with practical stuff and it would let me explore the attic, and get the only access to the roof which would get plenty of sun - that was the plan at least. I ultimately did harvest a modest amount, but I hadn't been able to water it properly in the end stage because I was out of town for a bit, so I ended up doing a pretty poor job of it all. 

My next plan, i.e. going out to buy me some, was doomed to fail because I'm not really that street smart and I live on the border to another country so checks do occur occasionally - bit too risky for my taste. Instead, I soon found out you could get weed via the dark net. It was like Willy Wonka's factory, you could even pick the type you wanted - hence me being able to tailor what I bought specifically to my needs. I was always a gamer and good with computers, so figuring out all of the technical stuff wasn't really a problem for me. Soon I'd found out how to do it all safely and anonymously (not going to explain it here, it's not meant to be an instructional post ;)) and with my ""modest"" consumption habits, I would pretty much never run out of weed, and each ""dose"" would cost me waaaaaay less than other drugs, maybe 10cts per dose and it would last me for months at daily consumption. Still, of course doses increased as I was building up a resistance, and I when I was feeling the effects of the smoke on my breathing system, I would want to quit - but not to give up weed. Instead, I would make edibles and use up the rest of the weed that way, ultimately leading me to stop - for a bit.  


After some time, I would get the feeling that I wanted to have weed again; usually this would coincide with some level of stress in my personal or uni life and there are definitely elements of depression there, but I'm handling that side of it pretty well, but it did lead me to get more of the green.   
At this point I'd moved in with my partner. I had initially kept the fact that I was smoking weed from her, but introduced her to it slowly when I realized that I wasn't going to stop, just because we moved in together - she is pretty liberal with this kind of stuff and also tried it herself a few times, but ultimately it's a bit too strong for her and she's tiny, so she never took up the habit (which is a good thing, I don't really need an enabler as partner, the opposite actually). In our flat share with one other person, we regularly had people over, a great social life overall, and an awesome, committed relationship between us. I did talk about using weed with my partner and I didn't want to be a ""pothead"", but I was making an effort to downplay its addictiveness to me. I was very open to her that I did not want to develop an addiction, and also that I did not really care for the smoke (even of pure weed) which is still bad for your lungs. Soon again, the same pattern emerged: my smoking levels went up, my breathing got worse and eventually I would need to pull the safety cord, baking lots of delicious triple choc cookies with what remained (don't wanna waste the rest right?) and stopping using when those were gone too.

Then, the pandemic hit. I'm an extrovert and having to deal with only myself and my bullshit was something I had not been prepared for. I repeated this same story above several times. I bought a new pipe, only to throw it away again when I realized what it was getting me into. Being the crafty bastard I am, I carved my own simple pipe from an old broomstick; same thing, got out of hand real quick. I am able to make a gravity bong from a glass bottle by cutting a hole into a glass bottle with a Dremel in about 25 seconds - I know because I tested it. I was still keeping up to date with my uni work and my personal life - as I said, weed doesn't affect me much in that way (though yes, I do get slower, sometimes overeat when the munchies kick in, but overall I was okay on that end).   


The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting things to change.

The last time I bought weed was pretty similar. I had found not one but two different strains that worked great for me: I was feeling more acutely focussed, more sociable and was getting more shit done (even made a diary entry saying exactly that). I had bought not one, but two glass pipes, one you could fill up with water, similar to how a shisha works. I had set out with specific measurements per dose, because I had gotten it into my head that I could ""control"" my consumption by using a scientific approach. After one dose, every other day, soon I was back to a dose per day, two, three, sometimes more. Some evenings I passed out with clothes on on my bed, waking up hazy, hungover state (actually feeling the effects of lots of heavy intake eventually). I kept saying that I didn't want to smoke, but put off actually quitting. When I ""decided"" that I wasn't going to allow myself to keep doing this, I researched how to make extracts: again my scientific theory was that I could control it, if I made a cannabis tincture and then took 5 drops, every day. That worked exactly as well as you would expect: I  was soon slurping teaspons full of the stuff, the 200 proof alcohol burning on my tongue. I also figured out, the genious alchemist that I am, that I could also make a more potent extract, and also turn the weed bits that had been in there  back into smoke-able solids by putting some of the tincture in the oven at low temperature, causing the alcohol to evaporate, leaving behind the thick extract, which packs quite a punch. So back again I was, doing the same shit over again, like an utter madperson.   


This went on for a while, and again I realized that this wasn't sustainable. I had smoked (or slurped) weed basically every day for nigh on two months. I had given the tincture bottle to my partner to keep and only give me it every now and then, for a chill day out maybe (?) but I figured out where she hid it from me basically the day after I asked her to keep it. I was deliberately waiting for her to go off to run  errands or to work so I could ""safely"" feed my addiction. Again, I threw away the pipes I had bought. 

This story comes to a head eventually: all the lighters ran out. No more smoking right? Oh, there is one more packet of matches. Matches are out? Oh, I can sprinkle a QTip with lighter fuel and use that as a match, using the spark of a run-out lighter to set the Tip ablaze. QTips have run out. You can wrap a wooden coffee stirrer with cotton string and similarly spritz on lighter fuel, effectively making mini torches to smoke up bits of evaporated weed tincture. Yes, I felt like the Pothead version of McGyver, but also I mean wtf, just writing it down in plain terms is just kind of insane, really crafty but also reaaaally insane.

One day, I had already smoked twice, I put some more in the oven. I was kind of busy, so instead of evaporating at a low-ish temperature, my sponge cake of a brain decided two switch on the grill function so it would be quicker, and ran off to my room. I was in the next room, doing something else real quick, when I heard a loud BANG. I ran into the kitchen to see the oven door slammed open, flames erupting from the inside; I had managed to explode my oven with 200 proof alcohol and a grill.  


I am actually impressed how quick my reaction to this was. I ran to the storage cupboard and got the fire-extinguisher out - I had stolen it from my previous house because they were renovating and getting rid of everything anyway - quickly dealing with the fire. There was lots of black burned bits of paper about the kitchen and it smelled like Ammonia from the fire extinguisher. This could have been really bad. 

Rattled somewhat, I managed to quickly clean up, my partner had sent me a message earlier that she was coming home soon. I got it all done, inventing some excuse that the awful smell must come from left-over oven cleaner that got heated up - which has a very similar smell - and I had gotten away with a broken oven light and a slap on the wrist by reality. 

The next day I was having a long uni-day on Zoom. I had made plans to do a digital work out with friends, but even after yesterday's experience, I went to my partner's room, snuck out the bottle and made myself another bong, and then another two after working out.

This sounds like it should end with some kind of catharsis, and it might still do, but I'm sure as you know - bravo for making it here if you did by the way, hope you enjoy the utter chaos that is this wall of text - when you have the inclination for addictive behaviour, it can be just SO hard to quit. You can rationalize so much, and make plans to stop every day and yet nothing happens, even with a drug that is physically not so addictive, but can be mentally very much so.  


I know that I have to stop using weed alltogether and me writing this is meant as a reminder of that. I am a month away from my thesis deadline, i.e. graduation, and my partner and I are thinking of starting a family in the not all too distant future. There is no way that I will marry, or even have children, while keeping up a drug addiction that might hurt them in any way; there comes a time when you have to take responsibility for others, family or otherwise, and this is not possible without taking some responsibility for yourself.  


I don't really feel shame in admitting that I am currently addicted to weed and I plan on working on turning that situation around - there's a lot of things that I love doing in this world, creating things, doing outdoor stuff and taking care of myself through yoga, exercise and checking in with myself.  


I know that recovery is possible for me and I don't intend to let myself down any longer - if you are in a similar situation to me, though your life might be completely different, know that you are not alone, sending good vibes! <3  


 It's actually been quite good for me to spell this out in writing - not sure if it's for everyone, but it's given me a little bit of closure, despite not being able to burn this down like a piece of paper ;)",3,1

My main question is ""How much alcohol consumption per week is too much for a man?"". I am wondering if my loved one has or is at risk of having an alcohol problem.
 Me and my boyfriend are living together for about two months. We have been dating for the last five years. And I have always known about his frequent ( in my opinion!) alcohol consumption. What bothered me before the most was his binge drinking. For example if there is an event, party, wedding doesn't matter he drinks a lot. Like, he can consume at least one large vodka bottle by himself and he doesnt stop there. 
He never goes out with friends without drinking. That is a very rare occasion. He also has a few friends who are actual alcohol addicts  (they've been to psychologist and tried to stop multiple times) who drink every single day. So my bf doesn't drink everyday,but I personally think he has an urge to consume alcohol. Lately I have noticed he drinks approximately 3 times a week and gets moderately drunk. He comes home very late. Usually wakes me up with all the noise he makes. Stays up late. He is never so drunk that he cannot walk or talk. But he deffinately slurres his words and repeats frazes a bunch of times. In the beggining of our relationship he drank a lot of beer. 
But now he preffers drinking vodka. Sometimes beer.  What I have noticed is that he drinks at least 400 ml of vodka on one sitting. He also drinks a beer or few. So please people tell me if I am crazy? If I am overexagerating? I need help.

During the 4 years of what we call ""college"" which is between 10 ans 14 yo, i had to deal with billying, i had only a few friends and i couldn't speak with any other child without being harrassed.

So this was a great shelter for a time, but now i see everyone leaving video games around me and i feel like it's wrong to continue to only do that but the others things seems soooo boring in comparison on video games.

Opiates took all my soul and life and I thought I could never recover it but now I have a little hope for it. A week may seem like too little to some people but for me it's a lot of time... Little steps but I feel good. Let's reach a bit more ☺️❤️",4,0

Skip this post if thats the case. 

Went yesterday and online says it starts at 9pm. Actually it starts at 8pm haha. 

When I got there there were still a few guys. I can tell they’ve been through and have experienced a lot. 

I didn’t know what to say when they told me to “just start sharing”. I told them a bit about my self, hobbies interest, blah blah. Then we spoke a bit about my usage. Nothing deep, not a whole lot to say considering I’ve only used for a short time (few months and I’ve been decently responsible).

They warned me what it would lead to and what they’ve been through. What others have been through. Sad to hear and wouldn’t wish it upon anyone. 

The worst part for me, is literally me being there. I show up I’m a white looking good kid 23 years old. I guess decent looking according to people. But me having it so good and being in a place where I make them feel “damn I wish I had what he has” is the problem. Not to mean they would change their current situation, but wishing it was that easy for them growing up. 

It came out that I recently graduated college about a year ago. Only 1 dude out of the 3 others there heard me, he held up the convo the other 2 guys were having.. “Ayo hold that, hold that, tune in, this man just said he graduated college...from “XYZ STATE!!”. 

“Oh shittt whattt!!” 
“Damn boi what I would give to have a degree from “XYZ STATE!!” 
“Man you have all that and don’t even realize all you have” 

They didn’t say it in a cocky or negative way, or in a way to invalidate me. 

One guy (40 ish years old) (meeting leader) long term user - 20 years clean 
His boi (also 40 ish years old) used to smoke crack together - 15 years clean 
And some other guy (30 years old) about a year clean 

All I could think of is “yea I wish I can give this to you instead I don’t want it, it doesn’t mean a thing to me”. I didn’t say anything, just nodded my head and agreed.

I didn’t open up about hating my life, hating my parents, my abilities, my social skills, my negative experiences, my thoughts, my visions of the future. 

Idk, all that I listed doesn’t seem like NA is the place to bring it up. More like therapy. But Idk I’ll leave it at that. I wish the best for everyone. I think I’m comfortable and don’t know anything other than negativity and pain.",1,0

I don't know how to stop,"I'm 24 and I first smoked weed when I was 14. I was a light/moderate user in high school. I smoked a lot after I graduated, had to abstain when I was 19 due to getting in legal trouble for having weed and needing to go through court, and then started using it regularly again at age 20. I've smoked weed every day for the past couple years, I would say. Recently I've been smoking, 4, 5, 6 times a day. I live with my boyfriend, who also smokes. He developed an issue with dependence before I did, and I think that makes it harder for me to stop.

I dont know how to stop but I need to. I have ADHD, and I know my ADHD brain craves the instant dopamine release. It worsens my ADHD symptoms and at this point, with how heavily I use it, I feel like my medication is just cancelling out the negative effects that weed has rather than actually helping my symptoms. I also have narcolepsy. Smoking weed as often as I do is awful for somebody with narcolepsy.

I just don't know what to do. I smoke so often that it has very little effect on my overall functioning, so it's so easy for me to smoke and go about my day without really feeling like there's anything wrong. But I really feel like it's affecting my motivation and also my memory a little bit, and I'm starting to feel like I actually need to smoke to get through the day.",10,0

I’ve been off of heroin for a very long time now. I don’t count years. If I had to give it a number it would be around 7 or 8.

I look back to all the times I’ve detoxed and think “was it really that bad?”.

I think it’s mostly mental. I would always feel totally horrible when withdrawal hit on the streets. I would be ready to do anything to get more dope. When in jail, it never felt nearly as bad. I think this was attributed to the fact I knew I couldn’t get any heroin. So, I dealt with it.

In jail, the most I would feel symptom wise was a bit restless, some nausea, maybe a headache, runny nose and some sleepless nights. It felt like having a mild cold. Mind you, I had a big habit. It wasn’t from lack of taking a lot.

On the streets, I would go into sort of a desperate mode where the world was crashing down around me and I felt like I had the worst possible sickness ever.

All these years later I feel like such an idiot for acting like that. I remember making my family think I was about to die from these withdrawal symptoms.

This is about the person I thought was my best friend.","I didn't have friends until grade ten. I needed to believe I did at the time. Sometimes kids were even nice to me, but I never had a true, honest, caring friend untill around 10th grade.

Before I found the joy of actual friendship I had a previous best friend. His name was -----. 

----- has been through the rough. I've had a pretty decent and lucky life so far, but he's gotten the short end of the stick at every turn.

 With a personality of such dysfunction I wonder now why I was ever friends with him. He was a jerk. In general he didn't respect me as a person. 

He had one merrit to his personality; he was dead loyal. He had my back.

We sure did stupid shit together. I think that's all our friendship was, just pushing each other to outdo the other.

When we were just finishing grade 8 we decided to try pot. I remember ----- telling me we would try it once, ""just to have done it"".

We were crazy about drugs at once. As much weed as we could get, we smoked.

Weed was amazing, for a year we dove into that wold without hesitation. Even after being caught.
After about a year and a half we decided to start experimenting.

It wasn't an immediate decision to try any drug.
Fist we wanted to try shrooms. Then we tried nicotine, Benzo's, LSD, MDMA, dph, alcohol, and opiates.

My breakdown came about a year and a half later.
I had hit the bottom of my life. I knew I wanted to do more.
I finally quit successfully.

It was two and a half years before I relapsed properly.
I did relapse a few times during those two years, but never more then a day.

But for a while, I felt good.
I was clean and sober and doing so much better.
I kept it up for two more years.

Now I feel trapped. It's been years since I stopped being friends with -----, and I was doing a lot better. I just relapsed again recently, and I found this idea on r/leaves.

I want to personally thank all you guys for your on going support for me and each other, I'm super grateful for each and every word.

I'll admit, I have a cocaine addiction, a cigarette addiction and also I'm somewhat of a womanizer. Clearly I'm not too pleased of this and I'm looking to change things around this month. I got back to writing last night after months of not giving a shit and finally repicked up the recovery book by Russell Brand. It's putting me in my place a bit but I'm worried....that by taking out these harmful toxicities that I will get back to it and have even a harder relapse than the one before. 

Last night I wrote down what I'm addicted to and this is the list: Cocaine, porn, tinder, instagramming girls, webcaming girls, cigarettes, alcohol

This is what I want to strive for:
Better my french, study to get ISA certification ( international society of arborist), eat healthier, get better sleep, learn more about rats (I adopted 2, a couple months ago), get fucking fit ( btw I signed up for crossfit and I have my first trial class today, really excited hehe, get back to running, get my laptop fixed so I can make/edit videos.

Right now I feel it's such a long way's up and I know there is hope, but theres a strong part of me that keeps saying, ""you're striving for too much, you know you like to party etc"" 

Any of you can give me some advice to help me switch the way I think at times so I can actually put more time into what I want. Also a lot of the things in want to achieve feels like its gonna be hard and sometimes when I put time into it, it feels like a chore and that demotivates me to continue, how do you guys get through that kind of thinking ?

I got the Start Moving alert from the tracker and watched as he drove our car (that has one head light out & it's 1230 and that's just inviting police attention and he doesn't have a license) the 6 miles to the dopeman. As he was on his way back I called asking where he went. He said getting peanut butter, which could be true if he stopped at the Gulp n Blow across from the dealer. Without the tracker I still would have known because he was gone for an hour and put 13 miles on the car. Yes, I'm noting mileage too so when I call him out I can say I know because of mileage and not disclose the tracker.

The NarAnon meetings are closed because of stupid covid and the soonest appointment for a therapist I could get was 5/19. The space between what I know and what he says is making me sick.

One bad decision and the cycle repeats, i know what comes next if this is the route I take again. Cold sweats. Throwing up. Body hurts. Head throbs. Heart numb. Soul none.  I’m at a crossroads yet again and so many times before I’ve taken the same path. The definition of insanity yea I know, but I am crazy so insanity and chaos are my best friends. the devil is always waiting for any sign of life, any light so he can take it away again before you ever knew you had it to begin with. 

I seem to have a barrier which is 6 months. I’m terrified of what’s going to come. I’m blind sided and at a disadvantage for once. Luckily most them “thugs” are just cunts. I want to rid of them all and maybe this time 6 months won’t be my downfall. 

I thought you’d be the one who got the best of me and I was right in more than one way. You got the best of me in a twisted fucked up way. You also got the best of me as I’ve been clean but apparently that isn’t as much as it seems. Regardless I’m doing everything I can to take care of me and my child or a man. 

I want you to stand by me not against me. I want you to make me feel like I’m enough for the first time, I wonder how that would be? How would it feel to know your finally something to someone when you’ve been nothing to everyone. 

Maybe one day I’ll know. Maybe I won’t. But I’m enough for myself and I’m proud to say that. I know my flaws. I know my fuck ups but I’m still here and imma do my job. Imma handle my shit whether it’s alone or with you. But if you lose me I promise we are threw. 

Can’t be friends with my child of a man. I’m hoping you grow with me and take my hand. Heaven or hell it doesn’t even matter. We will fight and can walk the path together. I don’t want the boogeyman to be my only friend. I want you to be my security blanket when I feel him coming with the cold wind. 

My demons aren’t calming down but they are starting to understand that I run my life and they’re guest in my head. I can’t shut them off but I can be their friend until I kill them in the end. Then I’ll be free. The chaos will stop right? Or will it last forever. Maybe we will find out together. 

This is your last Chance. I don’t want this if this is how it’ll be. So man up cause we going to therapy. If you disagree that’s your right but I will end this and say fuck the fight. 

Gloves up. Next move is on you. Try to save a real life relationship or play victim on Instagram and get those likes that mean so much. That attention you craze I’ll just say fuck you have a nice day.  

Decision is now on you. Choose carefully because this is a one time offer. Doesn’t come in twos.

After multiple days of having to struggle to hold back tears at random points throughout each day. I finally let loose in front of my significant other and spilled the truth.

Long story short she has been nothing but supportive the last 36 hours as I haven’t eaten or gone to work. She has dealt with this amongst her family multiple times and understands how tough it is. I have honestly been more concerned about losing her than my new found financial situation. However, Telling her has not given me the sense of relief I was hoping. I have become more anxious and sad. 

And then Today she comes out of nowhere and says that what I did is “deceitful behavior”. Which sounds like she is now on the offensive against me. Am I interpreting this the wrong way? I’m hoping to successfully explain to her how my newly discovered disease isn’t intended to deceive her in any way shape or form.

I’m a 22 year old dude who suffers from gambling addiction. It took overhand in late 2020 where i lost over 20.000$ with a monthly income of 2000$. And now with a debt of 18.000$

The past month, i’ve tried to cover up my losses and my debt, but nothing went right for me. My birthday was 6 days ago, and this is when i knew something had to change. The day before my birthday i gambled and lost 25.000$ and felt like killing myself. I’m currently in some military education and my family was throwing a little party for me at home. This was my worst day in my life and had a hard time looking my siblings, mother and father in the eyes, knowing they gave me 100-200$ meanwhile i lost 25k the day before. It absolutely breaks me thinking how selfish and stupid i can be, gambling that much when i know my family is struggling financially. I’ve never felt this much shame before, i keep trying to cover my losses and ‘little’ money means less and less for me.. What should i do? 10k doesn’t even feel a lot for me anymore, while my father hunts a dollar discount in the groceryshop... Its ruining my life",3,0

Just sharing some good vibes here, in case anyone needs some motivation. 

Yesterday I had an appointment with my therapist, the first since late 2019... When she saw me, she said I was glowing. She asked me why? What happened?  My answer was sharp - I am almost 11 weeks clean! And she could not be happier. 

She knew I was still doing coke occasionally... She never condemned me for that, but yesterday she said well, finally, it was about time. We laughed.  

I am sharing it here so you all know it’s a process. We started working together in 2016. I was rock bottom, severely addicted to cocaine. She helped me change my life entirely.

So don’t rush your recovery, don’t get desperate - it takes time, a long time. I still have a lot of stuff to work on, I am resuming therapy to keep myself evolving, to keep working on my business and people management skills, and to keep myself clean. The certainty I have today, I want to prolong this feeling as long as I can. 

If you are in too deep, get help. You can and will recover!!",5,0

“More drinks! Sing a song! Go talk to that girl! Be loud! Be fun! Be funny!”
It’s hard for me to know if these were actual things being said as often as I heard them. Maybe my inner voice was so caught up in alcohol and ego that it just shouted these things at me on repeat. I remember worrying that people wouldn’t want to be around me or would be constantly wanting more, if I was sober.  I remember wondering if I was actually that funny or if it was just the alcohol. I remember hearing people tell stories about me and they always seemed to be about how energized and fun I was.
But I also do not remember a lot.  Putting in an order for 100,000 dollars’ worth of windows that had the wrong glass thickness.  Being reminded of the meeting at 9am that I missed. Emailing that customer that for sure we could get that job done by weekend when that was not a possibility. Receiving a letter of reprimand from my boss and shredding it because I was not capable of dealing with that.
It had become an endless cycle that kept me spinning, like a small child on an old school merry go round—I want to get off but there is really no safe way to do that.  I had to stop showing up at work drunk but I also needed those drinks to make the sale the night before. I needed to show the customer a good time but I was not positive I could do that without the drinks.  
Before I became sober it was literally part of my job to get drunk and party with customers. Essentially, I was to show them a good time, gain their trust and build a relationship but to do that, I was pretty sure I needed booze.
Looking back now, 21 months sober, and really seeing this merry go ground that I was on—it just seems so completely wrong and backwards to me.  I told myself it was fun.  It was safe.  It was what needed to be done. I can see so clearly now that it was none of those things. And like the child who laughs until he is flung off the merry go round and crashes into the ground, head first, it took a lot of pain for me to realize that.
One of the things people maybe do not get is how slow it can start.  
At first, I was just entertaining and funny.  I have a good sense of humor and a quick wit.  But, just like anyone else, I did not always feel up to that.  I wanted to lay low and talk about real things.  I wanted to listen to someone else tell stories or have someone make me laugh.  But, of course, that was not what was expected of me—sometimes by real people, but probably more often by that inner voice: Be fun! Be funny! Be loud!  So then when I did not feel up to that—I had some drinks.  Just to loosen me up, get me in the spirit, a little liquid courage.  All these things we tell ourselves that are very damaging and hurtful.
Before too long I was needing to drink to just go out with clients.  Needing drinks to make them laugh, to entertain them. And not just one drink to loosen me up—many, many drinks.  Because if I did not keep drinking, that feeling would sneak up on me, the one that asked if I was all right?  Is this what I wanted? Couldn’t I just be chill tonight?
Next thing I knew I was needing drinks to make it through the day.  I needed alcohol to do my job, to interact with people I saw every day.  I needed alcohol to quiet the hum in the back of my brain that maybe I was not ok, maybe I wasn’t enjoying this merry go round anymore. Unfortunately, this was easy for me to get away.  I could work from home or just claim I was still hunger over from the night before—""what a blast we had!” I’d shout and people would laugh and slap me on the back.  
Oh Jayme! What a character.
A character indeed.  A made up, story book character.  I was playing a role, lost in my own struggle. And why would anyone notice?  I had money.  I had flashy items.  I had fancy clothes.  I smiled a lot and yelled my catch phrases.  I began to change my patterns—hanging out with people who would not question the number of drinks or call me on my missed appointments or forgotten promises.  I would ditch out on people that made me feel guilty or were suspicious of my choices.  I would leave events so I could go home and drink more in private or meet someone who would jump on that binge train with me.  
I will not pretend it was one speech from my dad, or one painful tear from my sister. I will not pretend that the first time the police were involved raised the red flag or the moment my health was seriously called into question made me see the light.  But, somewhere along that crazy road of hazard lights, I realized I needed a change. And one of those changes was my job. I needed a new place to work, maybe even a new career entirely.
Let us pretend I knew the answer to where I wanted to work--what place would take me? An alcoholic with anxiety and depression. An adult trying to become sober who felt strongly that I was now boring Jayme.  No confidence Minor.  Without alcohol to give me my personality, I was a loser. The start of my sobriety started with those thoughts—very real beliefs that I was no good to anyone sober but knowing that I could not continue drinking and living the way I was.
Once I started reaching out and being honest with myself and people close to me, I was offered a job at MAXgreen Windows & Doors by the owner Adam Jones.  Adam was a long-time customer of mine and one of my closest and best friends.  He had suggested I come work for him a few times but, of course, I was too busy making money and avoiding people who really cared to take him up on that!  Now, I was ready, and Adam was ready to help me.
Adam supported me throughout the whole process.  He listened to me and assured me we would get through this together.  He said we would make it work. He did not care how much I sold, how much money I would make him or that I had a major drinking problem. What he cared about was helping me get sober and find a career path that made me happy.
Adam was there when I relapsed repeatedly.  He was there for me when I was terrified to try and cope with the stress of high-performance sales, sober.  He was there for me when I went to rehab, covered all my existing clients, and made sure they were taken care of so I could finally take care of myself. He was there when I got out of recovery and was patient, ensuring not to rush or pressure me into anything to soon.
And maybe that is what it really comes down to.  Adam Jones was there for me. He does not use the word boss and that is not surprising because that is not how he views his company. We are a family, a team—working together and stepping up when someone needs help.  People come first for Adam Jones.  That is apparent through the way he prioritizes his family, all his charity work and, of course, how he helped me get back on my feet and stay in a business that I really do love.  If it were not for him, I may not have continued in sales.  And, it turns out, I am a salesman.  Even without the alcohol.  I can make people laugh, have fun with my clients and find the right tone to make that sale.  But now, I can also remember these interactions the next morning.  And, if we are being truly honest, aren’t memories of those things the whole point?
MaxGreen and Adam Jones are two of the reasons I am here today, sober and strong enough to share my experiences with others. Huge gratitude to Adam Jones and the people at MaxGreen Windows & Doors.",6,0

So basically, I’ve tried a lot of shit: weed, alcohol, 2cb, acid, diazepam, Xanax, coke, flake, ketamine, gabapentin, etizolam, some other stuff I can’t remember but I have a very addictive personality, I smoke everyday but that’s not really what I’m worried about.

I tried mdma when I was 13 and from then I’ve been on and off it up until now, I believe I was addicted to it back then but I didn’t really even understand what was going on tbh, I was a kid. I didn’t take it (or any other substances except weed) at all during 2020 due to my circumstances I was forced to come away from it. 

However I recently moved back to my hometown where it all started, over here it’s a lifestyle and most of my friends and relationships are based upon drug use which is a bit fucked I know but there’s no way I can escape without feeling unbearably lonely and I can’t ‘just move’ because I can’t.

I started using md again a few months ago and many other substances including most listed above, I don’t really find any other substance except md addictive, I think I’m just more addicted to the idea of being on drugs all day every day of my life.

Yesterday was the end of a month long binge and I woke up this morning feeling extremely depressed which is strange bc even in the few day gaps I left in this past month I didn’t really get a comedown and I’m not sure why.

I realised this morning (now Iam completely sober for the first time in a while and could think rationally) that I’m maybe becoming addicted to mdma again but not fully addicted since I can take breaks in between. 

But I’m confused because I’m not craving it today I just feel horribly depressed and alone now I’ve come to the realisation that I really need to stop doing this, which in turn means I’m gonna lose all the drug-based relationships I have with people. (I love all of these people and don’t find that any of them peer-pressure me or anything btw) but there’s no way I can possibly hang out with any of them without taking any substance at all. 
And I can’t face reality without something in my system.

And to be honest the idea of going fully sober off most drugs including md scares me because it’s gonna be so boring since a lot of my drug use is just because I’m bored. But a lot of it is also to escape reality I guess. So the idea that I can’t do that anymore freaks me out since it’s become a lifestyle again. 

But I’ve been reading this page for hours and hours today and just sobbing over all these horrific stories and due to that is why I made the decision that I want to massively cut down or stop taking a lot of things I’m taking since I really don’t want to end up in anyone’s situation on here because it sounds like actual hell.

Most of my mdma use, I’ll admit, is due to my eating disorder that I developed probably about the end of 2020, now I’m looking back (anorexia, wow that sounds scary, first time I’m referring to myself as being anorexic.) At the time I didn’t realise I had an eating disorder due to the fact I don’t ‘look’ like I have an eating disorder, I guess that was denial, because now, I don’t even recognise myself.

The thing is, I lose weight so quickly and easily with no hunger pains when I’m on md. At the start of the binge I was 147lbs I’m now 132lbs and it makes me happy because I’ve always struggled to lose weight. So for that reason I also at the same time don’t want to stop taking md as I’ve found it to be the only effective way of weight loss after multiple years of dieting and exercise and all that.

I’ve thought about it for a while and I think I can definitely handle not taking mdma and trying to lose weight a healthier way. 

But again, I can’t handle being completely sober for the rest of my life, so I wanted to maybe just stick to cannabis use for a while and cut out everything else but the problem is that when I smoke weed I get really bad munchies, always have even before I developed my eating disorder. In fact I think that’s what triggered my ED in the first place was because I was smoking weed a lot during 2020 and putting on a lot of weight and feeling disgusting, ugly and just shit in general the entire time. 

I don’t know what to do next or what I should take and what I shouldn’t. My mental health is already at the worst point in my life so I don’t want to make my ED any worse than it already is or cause myself more brain damage than I already have these past 3 years by taking any more molly. 

I feel stuck and alone. Nobody knows about this except whoever is reading this right now and ofc the people I use drugs with but they aren’t aware I have an ED or that I’m addicted to anything. 

And to everyone who could be arsed to read this long jumbled mess of fucked up shit, thanks and I appreciate any comments. Also, I have not a single person in the world to talk to about this so anybody that would like to chat with me about it via message would be much appreciated too. 💕

I have tried many times to cut down my cocaine usage but have never been successful, at least for very long. I usually use every week or every two weeks, only for one day on the weekend. When I am completely sober I can find the idea of going on a binge offputting, but as soon as I have had an alcoholic drink my self-control goes away and i get strong cravings, usually give in and then go in a binge until 8 am or later. I find myself easily able to stay sober during the week, although I sometimes get cravings, but it is rare I am able to drink on the weekend without going on a binge. I usually do coke with friends,  most of whom eeem to have a much healthier relationship with it than me. Sometimes, especially recently when I am doing coke with friends I will hide some of the coke for me to do by myself, which has gotten me really worried. I have thought about going to NA or CA but am worrried I am 'not addicted enough' to need them.

I guess if addiction is a steep hill, with abstinence at the top and shooting up in an alleyway at the bottom, im holding on somewhere in the middle. It could be worse, but its not a stable place to be. Im going to go to an online NA neeting tonight and see how that goes.",7,0

I (25 F) live in a country where drugs are easily available through darknet an telegram bots. We are in the middle of a mephedrone epidemic. I don't know if mephedrone is popular or even known in regions other than post-soviet countries, but basically it is a type of euphoretic like MDMA or extasy (i saw that people referred to it as bathsalts, so maybe that). This substance is extremely addictive, maybe on the same level with opioids. The problem is really huge among younger people, especially teanagers.

I must also adress the fact that I have tried and actively used this substance a couple of years ago. For about a month I used every single day. The problem started about half a year before that. I have been clean ever since but I know for a fact that mephedrone is extremely dangerous and  fucks you up mentally in horrible ways.

My cousin (21F) got addicted to mephedrone about two years ago I think. She dropped out of uni because of it. She has a really nasty boyfriend a couple of years older than her who got her addicted and likes fucking up her brain a lot (like gaslighting). She hangs out with people who think that using drugs is a way of living and those are the only friends that she has.

I think she might have some sort of a mental disorder, due to the way she behaves, but that could be the drugs talking. She can easily get violent (especially with her boyfriend or so I heard), she likes guilt-tripping people into giving her money, especially our grandmother or her aunt (my mother). She is a pathological liar, I used to think that I could see it when people lied but apparently not with her.

She also has a really weird and distant relationship with her mother (my aunt), who has three other (younger) kids with another man. Her mother did nothing in this situation, but my cousin still continues to live with her. Me an my mom (my cousins aunt) tried to do something about it, we arranged for her to live with her biological dad for a month but she became bored after a couple of weeks and decided to come back to the capital of the country where we live. I personally spent like half a year trying to get her professional help, but that didn't get anywhere (first she agrees that she needs help, I find her a therapist and then she tells me to fuck off and the circle goes on and on). The obvious thing is to put her in a rehab but we cant afford proper rehabs, and the ones available are state-supported and... Well, they dont help much so to say. 

We were really close as kids but as we grew older we sort of drifted apart and I only found out about her addiction after she dropped out of uni. 

Yesterday I found out that she started injecting the drugs and that scared me shitlessly (mephedrone is usually snorted). I don't know what to do.",1,1

I’m 19 and she’s been an alcoholic since before I was born, but didn’t get really bad until I was a kid. I mean it’s almost constant relapsing, detox, hospital, psych ward and rehab visits. I have been dealing with this my whole life and his has affected me in ways that will follow me for the rest of my life. I really thought I was already pushed to the edge until today proved me wrong. She got drunk and physically assaulted me. And I know it’s not my mother, it’s the demon that is addiction that possesses her, but it doesn’t make it ok. I didn’t press charges because she’s only 95lbs, she wasn’t even able to do any damage (Plus she’s my mom, and my best friend). When she’s sober she is the best woman i’ve ever met, and when she’s drunk she’s the polar opposite of my mom. I don’t even know what to do anymore, I just want her to get better, but obviously at this point there’s nothing I can do that hasn’t already been done. I think they’re releasing her from the hospital either tonight or tomorrow, and part of me doesn’t even want to see her. I genuinely can not put into words how badly I want my mother back, i’d do anything for her. But it feels like theres no hope anymore. I can’t keep doing this, it’s affecting my physical and mental health. I also can’t give up because I don’t know what i’d do if something happened to her, she’s seriously my best friend. It’s a constant push and pull of distancing myself for my health, and not wanting her to kill herself on purpose (She’s suicidal depressive) or on accident. Truly i’m at a loss, I feel so bad because I know she doesn’t want to live like this. I feel so lost.",1,1

What are some methods to wean alcoholism? This may not be the forum for that, so please point me in the right direction. I can quit alcohol cold turkey for a week or two, but I end up going back to it as a coping mechanism for work, stress, boredom, anything. I never considered that I am an alcoholic, but I have reached the realism that I drink alcohol as an answer to pure boredom or just… because? I’ve been drinking every day. I can last a week or two but always go back to it. And at increasing measurements in my drink. I’ve always been anti-smoking, but given the recent vaping trend I’ve been thinking, does smoking a stick satisfy that need for anybody? Is that a decently acceptable bridge to sobriety?",1,0

I had just made out with my girlfriend for the first time and we made it official that night I came home dropped my first tab and tripped fucking nutsack I will never ever forget that night. I felt like a Chinese waving cat.  Fast forward a year im 17 dropping 800+ug every week or every other week spending all my money on it knowing I won’t have money for gas. 

My girlfriend has fibromyalgia and in the beginning she was extremely suicidal and went to a mental health hospital me being an addict thinking “lsd was sooooo enlightening” thought it would help me decide if I could really stay with her (being so young and having my love end it all would’ve scarred me for life and I knew that) this night was the complete opposite. I cried my eyes out for 12 hours straight soaking towels with my tears and snot. I had a static image of her with both her wrist slit on her bathroom floor. 

I developed something called HPPD (hallucinogenic Persisting Perception Disorder) because of this night it was really bad at first I had full on hallucinations as in I would see things that were not actually real/ happening. I was so scared I was becoming schizophrenic or stuck in psychosis I saw a psychiatrist and all she said was I’m sorry I cannot help you. I had her confirm it wasn’t either of those and never saw her again, my primary doctor then started researching hppd and has tried a few trials for me but nothing has helped.

Fast forward I’m 18 finally getting over this life changing condition (my vision is always hindered with visual snow (almost like TV static overlayed ontop of my vision, tracers, starburst from lights (pretty much astigmatism)  I used to work in a fast food restruant and it was an extremely toxic environment i walked out one day because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I got a job shortly after unloading semi trucks and storage containers. As a senior in high school I’m making 2,000$ a month working full time due to covid completely sober prospering shooting in the right direction with no looking back. 

I went on a family vacation in February and had the ability to drink and I did and this was not good for me at all.  ever since I’ve been back I have been drinking weekly only making sure it hasn’t effected my job in fear I’ll lose it. When I say drinking weekly I mean finishing an entire bottle of vodka in 1-2 hours drinking to black out and I can’t stop no matter how many times I tell myself no  I tell myself 10x more yes. 

I’m not really sure what to do at this point I want to stop but I can’t I know I can make good decisions but I don’t want to. I’m about to graduate high school and I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life but it’s definitely not physical labor. It’s good for me mentally but physically absolutely not. I’m 18, 5’9 and 135lbs I am tiny lifting thousands of lbs per day. I’ve had to wear a wrist brace for the past week because my wrist are starting to hurt and pop. I’m writing this absolutely shit faced right now. I haven’t gone back to “drugs” only alcohol and delta 8 thc but I fear soon I will. I used to do analogs of ketamine but someone close to me just found actual  s-ketamine and I’m dying to try it. 

The only thing keeping me from trying it is the Wellbutrin I’m on is lethal to mix it with.

I’ve had success off and on with abstinence, two separate periods of two years and several periods of 2 to 6 months. Over the last 4 years I’ve really struggled. The more effort I put into it, the worse it got. I was at a point where, if I was in active addiction, I was completely unmanageable. I think what made it get so bad was the whole “head full of AA and a gut full of liquor don’t mix” phenomenon. I would go balls to the wall because I “knew” I was screwing up and I had to use a ton just to bury the guilt. I would use as much as I possibly could to get my fill because it couldn’t continue for very long. 

About a year ago, my therapist at the time suggested that I get a medical marijuana card and get ketamine infusions for depression. Suddenly, my work, my family, and society in general was okay with me using. The immense drive to use was gone. I found I couldn’t keep the ketamine prescription on hand but if I had my mom hold it and make sure I took it as prescribed, I didn’t abuse other drugs....much. In the last year, I’ve had three short 1-3 day slips with other drugs. Which is disappointing but a vast improvement over any time on the last 25 years other than those periods of abstinence. 

However, it’s now time to cut the ketamine off or go to a maximum of twice a month rather than twice a week. I stopped using marijuana because, for whatever reason, it gives me anxiety now that my depression has lifted. I’ve been staying with my parents during this time. It’s easier to stay sober here and it saved me from going insane from the isolation of working from home during quarantine. I’m going into a sober living and IOP for a month or more if needed. I think it’s dubious to say the least, but worth trying. I’m leery of getting my own place,in a new city, without acclimating myself there in the safe environment of the sober living. 

Has anyone had any luck with harm reduction techniques similar to this? I’m not talking about methadone or suboxone. Those don’t get you high once your used to them. Ketamine knocks me into another dimension and the escape seems to be enough to satiate the addiction. Any advice would be appreciated.",3,1

If I have to pick one, the first that comes to mind is Loser by 3 Doors Down. The line that does it for me  ""Someday I will find a love that flows through me like this, and this will fall away....this will fall away...""  Deep down I know finding ""the"" love i feel so desperate for won't fix me, but that kind of love for myself just might. I need that love and self-valuation to flow through me the way the dope did, and maybe I'd feel like that thing that's missing, the hole i try to fill w drugs, will be filled in at last. But I lean more towards not liking myself still. I am trying, but..... it's hard. Y'all already know though.

I started work again after lockdown lifted in the uk, and also had uni to keep up with and assignments were looming.

I don’t want to smoke it but I feel I need it here just in case. Can anybody give me some tips on how to cope mentally with a relapse? Or how to prevent one from happening when you’re vulnerable? I didn’t think it would be possible after four months without smoking, but then again I’ve never tried quitting before so maybe that was naïve of me to think.",4,1

I quit both at the same time on December 1st 2019. On December 1st of the following year I quit caffeine and around 3 months ago I ditched sweets, cakes and the sweet stuff I've been living off most of my life.

5 weeks ago my partner of 5.5 years broke up with me, and we're in the process of getting stuff into storage and putting our house on the market. We had to give our cat up for adoption and I'm faced with the realisation I have to move back home for the forseeable future until I can save up enough for my own mortgage.

There's a lot of guilt maintaining addictions whilst you're in a relationship - both internal and the external guilt that your partner will emanate. I know that I quit substances for myself, and yet; I know that it was also partly for her.

Since we've broken up the cravings have been returning. My therapist says this is my default response to stressful situations. I'm no stranger to stress and mental health issues - I'm nearing 2 decades with depression and over a decade with anxiety. I'm also on a waiting list for an Autism and ADHD assessment - so I'm not exactly firing on all cylinders.

My ex seems to be thriving - we're both on time off from work and she's off seeing friends around the country and then going out for drinks on her birthday. I'm sat in my usual routine. I've always been an isolated person, but I always had friends at work to help. In my current job of 2 years I have no friends, and the town where I live I also have no friends.

This mix if loneliness, a recent breakup and feeling a sense of confusing freedom of being single again has made cravings ramp up. The past 2 days have been so intense, it almost feels like I'm back at day 1 of sobriety.

I have plans for my future once I move out - I want to job hunt when I'm back at my parents as I'm stuck in a poorly paid, stressful and thankless job. I'm also going to start going to the gym when it re-opens again at work. I'm hoping a new job will lead to new friends, and I won't feel so lonely. Right now all my friends are online. It's unnerving when you realise those you're closest to are actually furthest away from you.

I started sobriety hoping that it'd improve my mental health. I quit caffeine, began exercising daily for 1-2 hours, drank 2 litres of water daily and cleaned up my diet also hoping for marked improvements in health and wellbeing. Admittedly there have been some improvements - such as concentration, energy and a better sleeping pattern. But mentally? Depression and anxiety is a heavy burden for anyone, and going through this on a daily basis whilst sober is a lot more challenging that I expected.

I dug out a number of an old dealer a few hours ago. There have been a few moments today where I'd planned to go down the shop to buy booze. Thankfully I haven't pulled the gun on either of these 2 temptations. Instead, I reached out to friends online and I bought another book. In fact, reading is a new hobby that I rekindled in my sobriety, for the first time since university.

Honestly though, I feel like I've stagnated, and sobriety has really highlighted how big a rut I'm stuck in. My passions for my contact fire staffing, my drawing, photography and writing have nothing to do with the jobs I've worked in. After 16 years stuck in office jobs, living for the weekend and from pay cheque to pay cheque - I'm beyond fed up at this point.

I keep pushing on, I keep reading and trying to learn more in the hopes I can unravel the mysteries of how I think and feel. Truth be told - I'm far too sensitive for my own good, and I'm lost in my thoughts on a daily basis. A passing moment for the average person can become something I obsess over internally for a long time.

I'm not sure how to end this post. I find that writing helps calm me down and express myself. All in all, before my break up I had been doing quite well with my sobriety - after a few months I settled down into a routine. But for a long time now I feel like I've been stuck on autopilot and I feel deeply unfulfilled in life.

  There's a voice in my head telling me that this isn't an accompaniment and that no one will care because it's not pills or hard drugs. This is part of my minimizing mind set that I need to stop. Quiting weed was one of the hardest things I ever had to do. and for me the benefits have been significant. Going back to those old patterns would be significantly harmful to my life. My relationships would suffer. My health would suffer. My quality of life would suffer. So I should be proud.

When I stopped smoking weed. I started drinking every day.  I never thought it was a problem.  I've seen alcoholics.  I'm not an alcoholic.  In the past I was even diagnosed with fatty liver.  I crashed a car. I dodged a handful of duis. I spent a night in jail. How can I say this was never a problem?!?  I never needed to drink. I always could quit at any time.  

A week ago I quit drinking. I need to prepare for an exam.  Yesterday I really wanted to drink. Last night I had vivid nightmares. I need to stop. I can't handle moderation. I need to stop telling myself that MY issues are insignificant.",3,0

I can watch any match be it Test,  ODI, T20s and this IPL season I'm watching a lot of cricket. It's been like this since a few years now 4-5 yrs. And now with lockdown I'm home most of the times and sitting infront of the TV watching ball by ball of the IPL matches. I even view the videos in team handles / channels on YT. 

Are there any folks who've been into such CRICKETING addiction and come out from it. Because I feel this is taking up a lot of my regular free time. 

Any help is highly appreciated",0,1
