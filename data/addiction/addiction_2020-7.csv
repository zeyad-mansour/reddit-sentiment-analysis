They can fill one of those Tupperware bowls with cigarettes they pack on a Monday and it'll be gone by Wednesday.

My mom isn't that bad... I think. I don't know how much she smokes per day, but I do know it's more than I'm thinking. But my dad smokes at least a pack every other day.

I'm worried about the both of them. They said to me that they'd slow down on it, but that doesn't seem to be true. They smoke the same amount they usually do, with no sign of changing.

Please, help me. I have a feeling I'll know what'll happen if they keep this up. And I really really don't want that to happen.",4

We separated for about a year. We both were seeing other people. I finally hit rock bottom and got clean. Shortly after, she took me back. When she first took me back, nobody could know due to her being embarrassed. I truly did screw her over and everybody knew it. I slowly earned back her parents trust and close relatives. 

Now, we are at a point where it’s almost like nothing happened. The only thing is, she refuses to share any family pictures with me in them on social media or share that we are back together. If me, my son and her go to the beach, she will only post pictures of herself and my son. She says it’s because I made a fool out of her. 

I have been doing everything I can to be the man I once was. I have a job that supports my family, I constantly try to remind her how much I love her and how sorry I am. 

It’s beginning to really hurt that I’m hidden out of embarrassment. Since I have gotten clean, I have had horrible self-esteem issues. So in my head I make myself believe that she’s hiding me because I’m a terrible embarrassing scumbag. Or my trust issues bring me to believe she wants to be portrayed as single for attention (which is not the case, I’m just fucked up in the head). I ask her how long I have to pay for my mistakes, and she can’t give me an answer. I start therapy tomorrow to try and deal with my own issues. 

Anybody currently going through something similar?",8

Worry that if I stage an intervention my mom's divorce process will not be amicable/go well. Waiting a huge risk?"," (I cross-posted this to r/Drugs) 

Hi all,

**Some quick background:**

I am a young adult, financially independent and live in another city than my parents. I have a brother who is a senior in college and still dependent (but just received a confirmed job offer and will be independent when he graduates).

I recently came back to my hometown to work from home due to COVID. My parents have planned to amicably divorce for some time now (original timeline is that they would divorce following by brother's graduation). My Dad has struggled with alcoholism since he was young and would occasionally use cocaine while drinking. My Dad has had several year periods of sobriety since I was very young (i.e. \~12yrs when I was born, then another \~4yrs, and more recently \~3yrs).

**Recent events:**

Since I have returned home, my dad had a bad relapse with alcohol (after that \~3yrs of sobriety) and ended up drinking 3 times. He also admitted that he had been using cocaine. Long story short, my mom and I have realized that he has been using cocaine frequently (as in almost daily) for the past several months. This resulted in him getting sinus infections / gum issues (I believe from gumming the coke) / and a constant running nose.

Very recently (I imagine in the last month), my Dad has started using crack. I believe he may have switched from coke to crack due to the sinus/nose issues the cocaine was causing him (and potentially he was simply looking for a more intense high). From what I can gather, he is using crack daily and frequently throughout the day. Note that he attempts to conceal this from my mom and I and has no idea that we know.

As part of my Dad's relapse with alcohol (and the fact that he was driving very drunk several times), my Mom had decided to accelerate the divorce process and file immediately. My Dad also wants a divorce so they are doing this on amicable terms.

I am of the opinion that my mom and I should not confront my Dad about his crack abuse until the divorce process is complete (as in, assets are divided, contracts are figured out, etc.) so, if my mom needs to, she can walk out of the house in a matter of minutes and be fine. I worry that if we confront my dad during the divorce process, he may get violet/irritated, expensive lawyers may need to become involved in the process, and my mom currently has no where else to conveniently live.

My question for those in this subreddit who either have experience with crack addiction, and I making a grave mistake here in not confronting my father now since he just started this? Is there a materially higher risk that I lose him to this addiction to me waiting the few months for the divorce process to complete before some sort of intervention?

I know there is not going to be a perfect or known answer here. I hope you can understand I'm trying to simply use you all as a sounding board / see what the collective opinion may be. Really appreciate any help or insight here.",3

I’ve struggled with many different addictions throughout my life. Weed, alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, benadryl, robitussin, acid/tripping, masturbation/porn, food, video games, gambling weed on video games, and i’ll say “generalized intoxication” as a catch all for the various other drugs/combos i’ve tried in an attempt to escape reality.

Of all the addictive habits that I’ve ever had, DXM (robitussin) is the only thing to ever send me to the ER. And it’s done it twice. You would think after round two, I would get the point right? You would think that would be the moment that I finally say, “aha! i’m an addict and I need to drop this garbage!” but nope. You would be sorely mistaken. 

The realization came two days later. I went out to the grocery store, and saw that they had just recently stocked up on my favorite bakery sugar cookies. Now, prior to this I had been taking my diet very very seriously and exercising highly intensely every day (2-4hrs a day) and had gotten into pretty good shape, which, since i’ve always struggled with my weight is really cool for me! 

Anyway, I bought two boxes. And, by the end of the night, one box was gone. These are not small cookies, and it’s 24 in a box. In less than 8hrs I managed to eat an entire fucking box of cookies. I literally could not help myself. I would go grab one from the kitchen, and standing there eating it, the sweet deliciousness was just too good to resist! Let me just have one more. Okay maybe one more. Okay 4 is really it for right now. Until that happens 6 times and suddenly you’re laying in bed feeling absolutely sick to your stomach. 

I threw up. The stomach pain got so fucking bad that I stood up and ran to the bathroom. Hunched over the toilet, I hurled up probably 10 or so sugar cookies worth of ugliness. 

then i sat there and cried. this is not the first time i’ve done this. the first time i did it was on halloween when I was like 4 years old, and I literally ate myself sick from too much candy. And that’s when I realized I was truly, wholeheartedly an addict, down to my very core.

I have a problem. Enough for you is never enough for me. It doesn’t matter what it is, enough is never enough for me. I mentioned that I’ve been exercising recently for 2-4hrs a day; because i literally can’t stop myself. I go until my back is killing me and it hurts to walk and I can barely move without some kind of pain.

I figure if I can’t change the way I am, I may as well at least get myself addicted to things that are good for me.",2
2020-07-30 17:44:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/i0uwtx/how_to_reduce_the_guilt_shame_and_stigma_of/,"How to Reduce the Guilt, Shame, and Stigma of Addiction","Despite substance use disorders being declared a [public health crisis](https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/priorities/opioids-and-addiction/index.html) in the United States, harmful stereotypes continue to persist and negatively impact people with addiction. As a result of [stigma](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2020/04/addressing-stigma-surrounds-addiction), many people hide their substance use because they fear social rejection or criminal punishment. These feelings of guilt and shame only allow addiction to continue and for some people, it may even intensify their substance use.  

For some people, the lack of social understanding and support may cause them to avoid seeking treatment because they feel that getting treatment would negatively impact their jobs or other peoples’ opinions of them. Stigma creates barriers to recovery, which only allows the cycle of addiction to carry on and worsen.

Eliminating stigma is one of the most important steps in supporting people with addiction. As individuals, there are small but meaningful actions that can make a big difference. You can help break the stigma surrounding substance use disorders by:

* **Recognizing that addiction is a medical condition**  

   * Due to ongoing social stigma, addiction is often viewed as a moral failing that results from a person’s bad choices or lack of willpower. 
   * In reality, medical research has proven that addiction is a[ complex brain illness ](https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2018/03/what-does-it-mean-when-we-call-addiction-brain-disorder)that can affect any person, regardless of their character, strength, or lifestyle.
   * Learn more about the causes of addiction and how it impacts peoples’ lives.
* **Communicating with compassion and respect**  

   * Changing your word choice to neutral and non-judgemental terms is helpful because it removes negative associations that come with certain words.
   * Let individuals with substance use disorders choose how they are described and respect their choice.
   * Using [person-first language](https://www.drugabuse.gov/nidamed-medical-health-professionals/health-professions-education/words-matter-terms-to-use-avoid-when-talking-about-addiction) to talk about addiction and substance use reflects that a person has a problem, rather than blaming the individual as the reason for the problem. The National Institute on Drug Abuse recommends these terms:  

      * Instead of saying “addict” or “junkie,” say “person with substance use disorder.”
      * Instead of saying “alcoholic” or “drunk,” say “person with alcohol use disorder.”
      * Instead of saying “drug abuse,” say “drug misuse” or “harmful use.”
      * Instead of saying “alcohol abuse,” say “unhealthy alcohol use” or “harmful alcohol use.”
* **Having open conversations about addiction with loved ones, friends, and your community**  

   * Stigma will persist if we don’t openly discuss addiction and substance use. Talking about addiction as a medical condition helps to humanize it and remove negative connotations from the general public opinion. 

By pushing addiction out of the shadows and into compassionate conversations, more people with substance or alcohol use disorders may feel comfortable seeking treatment and [starting their recovery journey](https://www.eleanorhealth.com/blog/8-reasons-to-start-your-addiction-recovery-today).",4

When I was 15 I was raped by my partner twice, and it all hit me properly when I turned 18 and it happened again. After that I got into a routine of being drunk constantly. I’d drink before work, whilst I was at work, and afterwards. I worked at a bar so I’d go back to random peoples houses afterwards and take drugs with them. Often times, especially with pills, I never even knew what they were giving me. I constantly put myself in danger and made myself vulnerable. This continued for longer than I’d care to admit, and during that time of my life I can’t remember many times where I was sober. I can’t remember much at all, for that matter. 

I’m finally going to university this year after so many set backs, and I was worried that freshers and the party scene would throw me right back into that routine because the offer was there. I was reluctant to join sober societies because I still drink on occasion or smoke weed with friends (separately, and I don’t meet with strangers anymore so as not to endanger myself). I finally decided to join today and have made plans with people to hang out without the aid of any substances. I explained that I’m not entirely sober and why I wanted to meet them all, and they’ve all been so welcoming and supportive. It’s a small victory, but every time I’ve left the house since the lift of lock down I’ve done it when alcohol was involved. I’m proud of myself. I have a long way to go until I don’t think about only going out if alcohol or drugs are involved, but this feels really good and I wanted to share. 

Thank you all for reading💖",3

None of them (except benzos) turned out to feel particularly “addictive” to me. But I’ve come to realize that my caffeine use may have become an addiction after my friend and gf talked to me about it. 

I have had problems two other periods in my life with caffeine. One which I was using upwards of 600 mg of caffeine a day and sent me to the mental hospital. I was using caffeine to primarily stay awake as my life was starting to unravel at my parents house and I couldn’t sleep due to loud fights at night. The caffeine would help me stay awake after those rough nights, but then I kept having to use more and more just to stay awake. I was getting less and less sleep as well. 

I cut down my caffeine use for a while, but in the last year it has been amping up again. Especially I. The last six months. I was prescribed multiple drowsy medications for the day, and after almost passing out while driving to work twice because of the meds, I started to use caffeine to try to stay awake. This just spiraled out of control and now the last month I haven’t gone a single day under 550 mg of caffeine. The caffeine is affecting my sleep and anxiety levels heavily and I am starting to spiral downwards towards the mental hospital.

Last night I committed to going cold turkey. I got the best sleep last night I’ve had in more than a month. But I’m having withdrawal symptoms and it’s hard. I’m craving the smell, the taste of caffeine. I have a pounding headache. I feel no drive, no energy, I feel like a zombie. I feel panic every time I have the urge to have caffeine and then deny it. I can’t think.

Out of all things to have an addiction to. Caffeine? Like I resisted a Vyvanse and benzo addiction, but I’m realizing I keep returning to this one. I feel ashamed tbh",3

Describe yourself. Seriously, close your eyes and talk out loud, or under your breath, or type it into your computer, just don't continue reading this post until you choose what words describe your current self the most accurately.

I forget what I said when that person asked me to do this, but I remember that I described someone failing at life in just about every way. That person asked me; ""Do you think that person is going to make very good choices?""

No, of course not. That dude sucks.

""That's exactly your problem. You fully believe you suck at life. And maybe you always will suck at life, but only if you keep believing that you suck.

Around 2 or 3 months after I turned 16 when I started using. I never thought in my life I would start using drugs, but here I am. The joy and thrill it gave me was something I always wanted to feel. I always said to myself this would be the last time then you can go back to your normal life. Little did I know that's not how it works. More and more I bought it, and more and more I said to myself this would be the last time. I went from buying it once a week, then gradually I went to buy it every day. Every day I would use it, never a day I wasn't on it. A little while after I turned 17 my parents found out what I was doing and they were sad and disappointed, but I just didn't realize what type of situation I was in. I didn't take what they told me seriously. Twice they've caught me and the second time my mother told me that she is scared one day she is going to come into my room and find me dead. Even at that point, I didn't take what she said seriously. Even after she told me she wanted me to stop, I would keep using it. The more I kept using it the more I changed. I started to get easily aggravated over the smallest things and my eyes looked so much more different. People would always tell me that I looked tired and that I should get some sleep. Even then I didn't take what they said seriously. I know this isn't a hard of a drug as most would think, but every day I would buy sleeping aids to such a point that the store I bought from, they spoke up and asked why was I buying it every day. I just told them I have issues sleeping. From drinking small bottles to the bigger sized bottles. After I bought the store dry of their bottles I moved on to sleeping pills. The feeling that it gave me was something I never experienced in my life, and I loved it so much. I know that my situation doesn't seem so serious, but it is to me. Ever since I started drinking the bottles and taking the pills the way I looked at myself in the mirror changed. I saw an ugly version of me that left me disgusted. I didn't understand why I looked the way I did in the mirror until quite recently. I've been taking so many pills that every time I wake up my mind is just somewhere else and my eyes would look so bad and horrible. My mouth would be so dry and when I woke up the layers of skin inside my mouth would peel off so easily. It took me almost two years to realize what I've been doing to myself, and I feel so stupid. The smallest things that made me sad I would just take more and more pills. I realized now how weak I am for doing it. The smallest things in the world that I should've brushed under the carpet put me in such a sorry state that I would just go crazy. I remember so many times I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling my heart beating so hard and fast. I never felt it before. I've spent so much money on it and looking back on it now I'm realizing how much I regret what I did. It's hard to look in the mirror of what and who I've become. I want to be able to look myself in the eyes in my mirror without turning away. I want to look at myself, not with disgust, but with pride. Again I know that many of you may not see my situation as very serious, but I at least wanted to tell someone what I've been going through. I don't care if I don't have the best life in the future, I just want to see myself and be happy again. I used to take boxes upon boxes of it, and looking back on it now I realized I could've died.

He's supposedly still sick. I'm almost certain he didn't nor does have corona. The fact they wouldn't test him is nonsense. Anyways. He's coughing and throwing up but he smokes a shit ton of ciggs and is a severe alcoholic. He throws up after he coughs up a lung. When I'm home he almost never throws up or even has a coughing fit, yet he says he still sick. I pay for the hotel room we stay in (I was homeless too about 7 months ago, right before he was kicked out), I pay for his ciggs cause he ""can't live without them"", pay for his phone, pay for his car repairs (his cars broke down now again), and I pay for his booze. I've been trying to limit it but if he doesn't have alcohol in 6-8 hours or so he starts withdrawaling. 

I've tried to get him to go to another hospital or to the clinic I got him a city funded insurance card for, but he refuses. Says he always powers through but he just sleeps all day. Then I get home from work late and he wants to keep me occupied all night because he hasn't had any social interaction. It's exhausting. He was almost going to rehab but he fucked everything up.by telling them he made $20-$30k a year. If he would have just listened to me he'd be sober by now and out of my hair. I live the guy but right now I have to make atleast $$90 a day to cover the hotel, beer, ciggs, and gas for work. Plus i have bills im wayyyy behind on. It feels like an impossible task to get ahead. His cars broke down so I can't just leave him. He wouldn't even have a vehicle to stay in anymore. He'd be on the street, sicker than ever, and in a worse position than he was in before I started helping him. 

Then again I have my own addictions I've been slowly coming off of. I've been on phenibut, kratom, gabapentin, weed, and drinking this whole time. I quit weed. I'm 6 days sober from phenibut. I'm at a stable structured dose of kratom and can start tapering soon. The alcohol I can drop tomorrow and be fine but as long as he's around I CAN'T not drink; It's just too much stress to not to. 

I keep trying to make this work. I'm constantly back and forth between wanting to just leave him to fend for himself and trying to make it work long term, thinking things can change. I just feel sooo fucking trapped. My life is so enmeshed in his and it's taking its toll though. He's so resistant to any suggestions I give him though. I just don't want him to die because of me and it seems like either way I choose, whether to leave or stay and help, it's a definite possibility regardless. 

Someone please help me. I'm in way over my head. Please. Anyone.",1

2020-07-28 20:14:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hzqb2y/desperate_i_need_help/,Desperate. I need help,"Hi there. Throwaway account for now, but I really plan on coming back soon. Anyway...

Over the past 12 months, I have basically plunged into a massive cocaine addiction. Started using it on weekends and other special occasions - then every weekend, then every couple of days... before I could see it, I was using everyday and my life basically revolved about leaving work early in the afternoon, scoring a gram in the nearest corner and doing it in my bathroom. 
I tricked myself into seeing it as a reward for a day of hard work, an assignment I would complete in college, basically everything. All of a sudden, I had an entire routine established: score, go home, do one line after another and then ruin the rest of my day, freaking out over the thoughts of my family finding about it, the fact that it's had an awful impact on my performance in my job, the almost crushing debt I got into because of my drug habit... I will feel like the worst person alive for hours, then the effects of the drug will start wearing off and I'll end up falling asleep. The day after that, here we go again. My brain has basically began to deny me the capacity of thinking rationally. It's crystal clear to me that it's wrecking me in every aspect of my life, but still, day after day, there I am with the same shit over and over again.
I cannot do this anymore. I'm a wreck. But still, I cannot seem to come to terms with myself. With the fact that I am a sick person, with an illness that I'll have to battle for the rest of my life. With the fact that I could have done something so much better with all the money I squandered on this shit. That instead of getting closer to achieving my goals in life, I just drifted further apart from them by my own hands. I've read it all about how it's a process of forgiving yourself and blah blah, but It just won't click with me. And the heartbreak that comes from it has become yet another trigger for me.
I have a couple of friends from college who have offered their shoulders for me to deal with this, but I don't want to bother them everyday with my incessant bullshit. And I don't want my parents to ever find out about this - they're this elderly, very conservative couple who just wouldn't be able to cope with having a black sheep in the family at this point of their lives.
I'm stuck. I want to feel the joy of being alive and having the smallest shred of hope in the future again. Eat well, sleep well, have a normal relationship with my family and friends, find pleasure in reading, playing music and exercising again. We all seem to take these things for granted until we don't have them anymore. I need them back. However, everytime I look back on what my life was before all hell broke loose, it seems like I started doing coke to fill in for some gap I had in my life, and that going through detox, withdrawal and the whole proccess is just not worth it. I felt unhappy then, I feel unhappy now and I will feel miserable all the same if I ever get over this mess, so why bother? I need help with getting rid of this thought and convincing myself of using again no matter what as soon as I get out of bed in the morning.
Any help, kind words and life stories would be greatly appreciated. Sorry about the long post and thank you to those who made it until the end of my sad, miserable, pathetic drug-fueled rant.",3

I hung around with the wrong poeple and eventually dropped out of school. Arround that time I  discovered speed and xtc. I was living with a friend who was into drugs aswell and I spend 50.000 euro on my addiction in around 18 months( i had those from my dad). After loosing the flat i lived in i was clean for like 3 months and even got a job. But that all went shit once i got into weed again.Only this time i mixed it with alcohol. To get money i had to steal and break into houses . Not long after that i landed on the streets ,living in a tent and begging for money . It didn't take long for me to go to prison. There i got into using subutex ( something the heroin addicts got from the doctor so that they don't get withdrawl).Once i got out my addiction got really bad .I was using prettymuch everything i could get my hands on . 6 months later i hit rockbottom. I got into therapyand turned my life around.There were some ups and downs and wasn't clean all the way ,but i finally had a live. Now the whole corona situation going on I relapsed with weed,alcohol,speed and alcohol . I lost my job and I am pretty hopeless. I don't want to go back to my old self.

I’ve abused anything and everything for about 10 years and now I finally have the upper hand and it feels so damn good. For the longest time I’ve used will power and I would relapse over and over again. Will power is important but we also need the help of others, which leads me to the new strategy I’ve been using. I am fortunate enough to have loved ones, and they are my new anchor when it comes to sobriety.

So every time we abuse, we think about how it negatively affects us, but that’s not enough. We have to start thinking how badly it hurts our loved ones. Anytime I think about abusing, I think about my family, my father, my mother, my brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. I think about how much suffering I’ve caused them, and how much I love them. The idea is not to guilt trip yourself into stopping, but it’s to remind us that we’re not quitting just for us, but we’re quitting for our loved ones as well. So I’ve broken this strategy into steps.

1) forgive yourself for causing suffering to yourself and your family
2) think about your family every time  you have an urge
3) refrain from abusing = stopping pain for yourself and your loved ones = building happiness

Please let me know what you think and if there’s anything you can add that may help !!",13

There is just so many cans of sprite in the trash and I honestly don't see what's bad about it besides it's probably not a healthy way to deal with things.
It's not making me any where gain weight but I still know it's tons of sugar.
I'm trying to figure out if it's the sugar or the carbonation with the flavor I'm addicted to.

It's been a month some what of a half and I got through two boxes of it. After I'm done with a box I get more (I prefer can I've bottle it's just better).

2020-07-27 09:06:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hyrwov/drugs_are_conscious_beings_involved_in_abusive/,Drugs are conscious beings involved in abusive relationships with their addicts.,"I believe every atom in the world has a consciousness, to some degree. Our human consciousness is uniquely complex, but we know that there are other animals that have self awareness to varying levels, and complex consciousnesses in their own right. All consciousness is, is energy interacting with matter. If that theory trickles down, even a rock is technically conscious, because it contains energy. By that same principle, drugs are conscious to a certain extent. 

How about a virus? Is a virus “conscious” the same way a human is? No. But does it have an innate desire and configuration that results in its own reproduction and continuation of species? Yes. There are certain viruses that hijack neural pathways and cause the host to do things they would not normally do. 

Now think about a Tulpa. A Tulpa, if you do not know, is a thought-form-energy-ghost, that is a consciousness bound to nothing, created from the ideas of man (highly compressed description of the subject). Basically, it’s an imaginary friend that takes on a mind of its own, and is itself conscious. 

If you can follow where i’m going with this, could it not be said that drugs have taken on somewhat of a combined viral-tulpa-like consciousness, wherein they have created a group of addicts that “need” them to exist, which in turn creates a group of suppliers who will actually make the drugs, continuing to bring them back into existence, acting like the host of the virus, constantly spreading it and keeping it alive. Now, this does not mean that the drugs consciousness is deciding to be destructive. There are many different drugs, not all of them destructive. Caffeine for example. But then, what about heroin or meth? Highly destructive! In my opinion, drugs all have their own “personalities,” to a weird degree. The more you get to know them, the more they show you their real self. It’s like meeting a really charismatic sociopath for the first time, and they’re so much fucking fun to go out drinking and partying with, and then as you hang out with them more frequently you realize, wow they’re actually pretty self centered and rude as fuck and wait what did they say about me while i wasn’t around? 

I liken addiction to being in an abusive relationship. As an addict, you are glued to your substance(s) because you truly believe that they’re helping you with whatever bullshit you think you need them for. As someone in an abusive relationship, you think about all the small good things that they ever did to show they care, and try to forgive the glaring issues that they have. It’s, really a pretty similar situation. As someone who has personally gone through both, it’s, really almost exactly the same feeling. The addict is not the abuser. The addict is the abused.",19

He was diagnosed as bipolar. He took meds for a few years, hated side effects and then just stopped taking meds a few years later. He's angry all the time, depressed a lot of the time, treats my mom like crap... he's just difficult to be around 70% of the time. Back in February he started having paranoid delusions and hallucinations. My parents had to call 911 on him twice because he was having a breakdown and just going nuts. He was in the hospital for 4 days each time and they just started him on meds and sent him home. He eventually got diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder (which I understand to be a combo of bipolar and schizophrenia). He's on Lithium, an antipsychotic, and something for anxiety. Thankfully he's not having delusions anymore, but he can't stay in one place for any length of time and he's basically not sleeping at all. Because he can't stay still he goes out and drives around all night. We thought this was all due to anxiety or mania and that he needs his meds tweaked (he does have an upcoming appointment on Aug. 7th), but my parents are giving him so much money every day and we don't know what he's doing it. they're giving him waaay more than what he would need just for everyday things, and he's still calling me in the middle of the night multiple times a week asking for money because he's ""stuck at a gas station without money"". It's very suspicious and I started to suspect that he's buying drugs. When I looked up signs of addiction, specifically cocaine, he has a lot of them, and coincidentally they go along with signs of his mental disorder diagnoses, so I'm still not sure if I'm just making assumptions or if it just is legit symptoms of his mental illness.

So I'm not really sure what to do about it. I cut him off because the amount of times where he calls asking me to paypal him money for gas has multiplied over the past month, and it makes no sense to me why he can't just put aside like $5 per day for emergency gas money. Of course he tried to give me a guilt trip and make me feel like a terrible person about it. And my parents are definitely enabling him but I know it's hard to just like cut someone off from money when he gives all these excuses about why he needs it (basically a step below a sob story every time- we all walk on eggshells around him because we know he's dealing with mental illness but we also don't want him taking advantage of us and getting the money that he needs to buy drugs.

I don't know how to get him help other than holding an intervention, but I know an intervention isn't going to help at all because he's not going to admit to drug use.",2

The amount and frequency of my use has fluctuated but at this point I have been using upwards of 720 mg per day for the past few years. Other than a somewhat diminished short-term memory I can't say that I seem to be suffering very badly in terms of my health, though I have not been to a doctor in a while. I have always felt somewhat out of place in the world, and during my sophomore year of college, I essentially had a nervous breakdown and realized that there wasn't anything in particular I wanted to do with my life. I dropped out and have been working low wage jobs since. At some point after this, I had a cold and a cough and downed a whole bottle of Robitussin, genuinely by mistake. I wasn't paying attention and drank too much. I got high, loved it, tried it again, and again, and never really stopped. I have at times been able to pause my use, sometimes for months, but I always went back to it. At first I enjoyed it for the intense, transcendently weird experiences of high dose trips, but gradually I began using to maintain a certain level of numbness, because facing my life sober was too difficult. I lived alone, never harmed anyone and basically kept to myself, but in the past few years I have been dating and have gone back to school, and the contradiction between what appears to be me getting my life in order and what is actually happening is too much for me. For one, I spend insane amounts of money on the drug. Secondly, I hate myself for lying about what I am doing. Lastly, I have this weird sense of derealization, because by all outward appearances I am doing well, or at least not spiraling out of control in the way I think I really am. I'm poor for my age, but I'm a full time student working part time so people generally are understanding. I am doing well in my classes. My relationship is happy. But I can't stop. Every day I find myself buying it, telling myself that I should stop, that I hate myself, that I'm a piece of shit and I should just learn to control myself, but I don't ever stop. I don't know what to do. I hate lying to my girlfriend, I know that the responsible thing to do would be to break up with her and sort out my own problems. I feel like a despicable piece of shit, but my use is like this hidden, private part of my life that doesn't even feel real. I don't know how to describe it. I'm not homeless or alone, I haven't ruined any relationships with anyone, I'm just trapped in this private hell of having no control over this vice. I'm sorry if this post seems self-indulgent, but I needed to get this off my chest. I need help but I don't know how to get it.

Why have I let substances take over my life? And how do I stop? 

How can I possibly learn to enjoy being sober, ever again?",3

I have always had insomnia but I’ve always dealt with it well throughout my life. Last year I found myself unable to study throughout my hardest semester because I didn’t have energy to study enough. Last summer I started buying Xanax to fall asleep and wake up fresh to study all day. I stopped after I was done with my midterms ( a week straight of taking 2mgs a day). I felt really weird and panicky, then learned about withdrawals. So I kept taking them and basically got hooked.

It’s almost a full year of use now and I am now drinking 12 beers a night and popping 2mgs a day just to fight my withdrawal symptoms. Because of isolation from quarantine and the stress of studying for my board exam I feel even more reliant on these fucking pills. I take it everytime I meet friends because now I am really not myself and can’t socialize if I am in public. This thing has taken over my life and I can’t deal. I am now applying for med school applying for a hospital job but I know I can’t keep living like this.... I tried tapering down alone but I can’t handle the physical discomfort. I don’t have insurance and can’t afford inpatient rehab. I’m just lost. I’m high as hell as I’m fighting this smh.

I’m mostly venting but I would love any advice from anyone who’s been here. Never thought that just trying to sleep would lead me to become a drug addict and alcoholic. I’m so ashamed.... I’m an immigrant and my family stays in my home country, I could never announce it to them as it would add too much stress to them already trying to stay safe from covid in a third world country with little medical resources.

I had quite the problem with abusing ecstasy pills, until i got pretty severe withdrawal and they wouldnt hit anymore, could kinda feel the physical high but not the mental high with it.

I listened to an artist i used to always listen to when i rolled on ecstasy, and i guess i wasnt as stable as i thought because it gave me a weird nostalgia about literal drug abuse and made the cravings for those highs and substances sky rocket for the first time in a while.

Even had thoughts like ""It wasn't that bad, it was worth it."" ""Remember how good it felt.?"" ""You got out of it so it wouldnt even be a problem if it became a problem again."" and many others, im trying to lessen the worries i have about spiraling.

One strong thing i have is the want to not hurt my s/o who was with me thru the bullshit of me first smoking weed daily, then starting to take ecstasy multiple times a week, and then drinking excessively.. It was complete hell for mostly them, and it made me extremely pained to see them suffer and feel so bad because of the choices i had made and how i again and again abused different substances. But my brain tries to get me to feel ok with this by thinking ""It could just be a one time thing, its not a guarantee it will become a problem again"", which is i guess true but the risks of it getting back to the point of me having a substance abuse problem are far too high to listen to that little voice in my head and trust it.

Any advice to try to stop those feelings and thoughts, and how to stay on the right path?",2

Hey all, porn/erotica addict here. I was clean for about 4 years after finally getting caught red-handed, and started going to Sexaholics Anonymous. Unfortunately my schedule changed and none of the in-person meetings in my area worked out, so I stopped going to in-person meetings. I relapsed twice over the next two years, only got caught the second time. Wife nearly left, I checked myself into overnight psych observation because I couldn't stop thinking about killing myself (although I know intellectually I'd never do it.). We've reconciled and are moving forward together. She's semi-active in COSA and it helps her a lot. It's been about 4 months since last relapse and its fallout. 

I could've been going to phone meetings once the in-person meetings stopped working w/ my schedule, but I didn't. After relapse I did 90 meetings in 90 days w/ a Daily Sobriety Renewal format; now I'm going 3x a week and doing 'step work' or reading from the White Book on most 'off' days. 

Thing is, the 'step work' I have is through this 'Steps to Freedom' workbook that I don't really feel like I'm getting anything out of. It mostly just asks me stuff I already know and understand, although admittedly I'm only a little ways into step 2. But the questions are so detailed and specific that I can't come up with an answer for a lot of them, even after sitting and sincerely pondering the question for a while. 

Often when my wife gets an emotional trigger, she asks me ""What's different this time?"" to which my answer is ""I won't stop actively working the program ever again."" 

But I'm not really sure what that looks like. What does 'working the steps' mean, and what does it look like? With all the COVID stuff going on there's no in-person meetings in my area. Do I need to get a sponsor again? If so, how do I find one that works for me? I've had a sponsor once before but we didn't really 'click' and he relapsed and stopped coming to meetings anyway. 

So what am I supposed to do? I am willing to do the work, but I don't exactly what that's supposed to mean or what it looks like. I could really use some input here.",3
2020-07-25 10:37:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hxnq3q/lying_to_professionals/,Lying to Professionals,"Hey guys so I’m in need of  any advice or suggestions. A family member has been using meth for about 2 years now. The last year has been the worst, he’s developed delusions and he’s paranoid. His immediate family has a restraining order put on him and their house. He’s bounce around from house to house of relatives, only lasting a couple of days before he returns to his parents home. Even gone to the point of sleeping on the street, no one wants to take him in anymore because he keeps bringing or using the drug in their house. He denies he has a problem but it’s pretty evident from his behavior even down to the way he looks.




Anyhow, recently he accepted to looking for a rehab center. All centers so far have a waiting list of about 2-4 weeks. And btw I didn’t go when this all went down, so I’m just kinda basing it off of what his mom told me happened. So they go  to about 3 different rehab locations and he apparently gets evaluated by 2 people at one of these locations and then they tell her that there is absolutely nothing wrong with him, that he’s perfectly fine.



As I mentioned above he’s developed what I assume is severe delusions, mostly targeted at his parents, an ex gf and then he’ll seem to start suspecting of whomever he’s staying with, that’s why no one wants him around. Its a long laundry list of delusions but the 3 big ones would be that he says his parents were killed and these “parents” are now doppelgängers. That all his family, uncles, cousins, etc... are all from gangs and they’re threatened not to help him. And that all LAPD are also working with gangs and all of them are fake cops.



It’s the second time he gets evaluated and it’s the same thing. Now after the firs time, he did admit to me that when he was evaluated he pretended everything was fine and didn’t mention a thing about any of his delusions. He fakes it so they don’t find anything wrong with him. So I don’t get it. What else can be done? Do they not ask people close to him what his behavior is like and take their experience with him into account?  Will the police reports and all the times he’s been incarcerated not serve as enough evidence of his behavior? We were thinking to record him when he’s talking about the delusions because it seems like nothing else will be taken into account. Now  because of the diagnosis, he gets to hold on to what was evaluated and he has the idea that he’s perfectly ok, that he’s ok to keep using meth because it’s not affecting him.

Could it be the area of the places he gets taken? I mean not to sound fucked up, but they live in Inglewood, CA and I’ve seen the amount of homeless and drug addiction around there, I know it’s everywhere but maybe the people working at those locations don’t really try their best unless the person seems to be in dire distress.

I never really had a relationship with my father because of his addiction. He was around every few years but at a certain age I gave up on the idea of having a father. I was lucky enough to to have my grandparents step in and raise me.

My dad went to prison for three years because of his addiction and was released about a year ago. He reached out to my after he was released but I wasn’t ready for communication or a relationship with him. 

I have been struggling since my mom died for it trying harder or trying to understand and help her more when she was alive. I hold guilt everyday because of this. I feel like I let her down and that is a hard thing to live with. I know deep down I was the child and they should have been there for me and I did what anyone would have naturally done in that situation....

I finally came to a place where I was willing to open up lines of communication with my dad...I have to at least try. I don’t want to live with the guilt of losing another parent and not trying...I sent him a message and said we can take steps and see where this goes. I don’t know where to begin or how to begin...

How do I rebuild a relationship with him? I know nothing about him.... I don’t know what to say or how to say how I am feeling.

New to Reddit so please forgive any etiquette faux pas. 

Settle in for a crazy ride. 
I (26F) met this guy (31M) at a psychiatric clinic last year, I’ve scoffed the fraternization rules before because who on earth would hook up with someone you met in the psych ward? Well, me apparently. He was there for major depression with “previous” substance use. I was there for a depressive episode in the context of Bipolar Type II and suicidal ideation. 
Anyway, we had this crazy chemistry and connection. We got on like a house on fire and we started dating officially when we left the clinic. Red flags started popping up the moment I interacted with him outside the clinic. E.g. he had conveniently spun a story that made it seem like his mom was temporarily staying with him as support when he got out of clinic. False. He lives with his mom and her husband and has for like the past three years. He told me that he hadn’t used narcotics in so long but was always very vague about what his drug of choice was. Months later it came out that it was meth. 

To make a long story short, we broke up after 3 months and then got back together in March this year. I was being cheeky and playfully asked if he would organize me some coke, at that point I had only done it once or twice before. It was the stupidest sentence I have uttered in my life thus far. Anyway, your boy pulled through and so ensued a three day binge. During this binge he would blindfold me and blow smoke into my mouth, when I asked about it he said it was the coke. I was confused but naive about the ins and outs of narcotics so I trusted him but there was a niggle in the back of my mind that he was lying. 

A whole load of drama ensued in the following months but the point here is that at some stage, and I don’t even remember exactly when, he offered me my first pull of meth. To my horror I said yes. After the fact, he lamented how sorry he was that he ever let me do it blah blah blah. But then he continues to offer. I am weak and I have a really hard time saying no. As I type this, we are on day 3 of a binge and I’m furious with myself and the situation. He says he doesn’t want me to do drugs which I think he means but if I order with him then I pay half (or more) so I think he might be using me for the money as he smokes most of it anyway. I’m not too worried about becoming addicted to meth, although logically I know I should be, but I hate it. I hate the taste, the smell, the feeling, the come down, the whole experience. I don’t crave it or even think about it when I’m not with him. But he also got me on to online gambling and when I’m wired I will sit for hours and spend hundreds (that I don’t have) on the slots. This worries me. A lot. 

To be honest, I don’t know what to do from here. I’m at the cusp of going down a very deep, dark rabbit hole but I just don’t have the power to walk away. Anyone had a similar experience and willing to offer advice?",1

He fully understands the consequences of his actions. Me and him have had a a great last few days and we’ve bonded more than ever but today he came home and was very clearly on ketamine (trust me I can tell. He’s my brother for fuck sake) in my mind that’s completely undone any bonding we’ve had the last few days. He knows how bad it impacts us but he cannot help himself. It’s been going on for years. I have to leave him to it when he gets like this so I have gone to my dads house but I worry that he’ll hurt himself and if that happened it would completely destroy my life.

At the beginning of this year I had little hope or motivation to live. This manifested in habitual drug use and anger and resentment towards my loved ones.

Not only has this year provided me a chance to look at myself with a new perspective, it has reignited my passion for life and empowered me with a vision that prior to this year I couldn’t have dreamt of.

When I was deep into my habitual drug use I believed my best course of action was to disconnect from my family and friends.

I was too ashamed to talk to people of my past and try to connect with them, for fear of the harm I caused them.

My sister-in-law felt my presence was damaging to her daughter, my niece Eevee.

I was more disconnected from my brothers and sister then ever before.

I fought with my My Mom and Dad constantly and they wanted me out of the house.

A part of me thought that living on the streets, or even death, away from all my loved ones, would be the best use of my life. If I went my own way, no longer would I be able to harm them.

Today, I’m closer with my family. I am a positive influence on my niece. I am closer to my brother than we have been since we were children. I am eternally grateful for my parents and everything they have gone through to support me. And I’m beginning to mend relationships of the past.

Most importantly, I finally see that my presence can be a positive influence on the lives of the people I love.

Is it normal to miss doing meth? Like, I’m reading a book or something and doing meth just pops on my mind like a pop up? and the worst thing is, every time it happens my stomach turns and I want to vomit whatever I ate if I already ate something or just plain refuse to eat if I haven’t yet. Sometime I just think about life and meth comes up again. It’s hard being this way. Is there anyway I can stop thinking about it?

R/addiction, I need help. I also want to know if anyone else has gone through what I am currently. 

I have smoked weed and cigs for a while now, about 10 years. Im in my late 20s now. 

Over the past year or two, as ive transitioned into the workforce (I was out for several years after school due to mental health issues), I have found myself feeling a compulsive need to smoke a cig every 2 hours. This means if I don’t have one and I have a meeting, I feel the need to go rush one before i start. This is even if im not craving one. (I should mention I suffer from ocd)

This wasn’t always possible beforehand, as I was at the office pre covid. So I wore nicotine patches all day. 

The issue... now my body feels like it cant handle the 8-10 cigarettes a day I smoke, so I am still wearing the patch. I also can’t just drop everything and go smoke whenever either even though im home. What makes it worse is I cant seem to let go of my morning or before bed cigarette so I have the patch on and take it off during a 24 hour period. Some days i even take it off and have a cigarette mid day then reapply it. 

The reason I get so anxious is I picture myself going several hours without a cigarette and then blowing up at someone like a customer or coworker. I have this compulsive thought process where I simply CANT imagine enduring nicotine withdrawal and that its the worst thing that could happen, and I just can’t deal with it. So I get on a timeline of a cigarette every 2 hours even tho my body cant handle. I use patches to get through small windows like 4-8 hours so I can give my body a break sometimes, which makes me feel like shit. Anyone have this? 

Similar issue with weed.. have to have a few hits in the morning to “get some in my system” cause I know I cant smoke at later times during the day and I fear ill go crazy without. 

Been in therapy for a while, done lots of CBT, so I don’t know how else to handle these thoughts/behaviors! If anyone needs more details please let me know, this was a tough one to explain. 

Tldr: Cigarette cravings cause me to use patch in way thats unhelpful. Feel like patch is only way to avoid body hurting/getting angry at work but its also making me feel bad and like I have no control. Stuck in bad cycle. Cant fully quit, particularly taking patch off to smoke an AM and PM cigarette, perpetuating the cycle.",1

I am 17 and am from the Uk, 6’5ft (198cm) and when I return back to gym/MMA I will be around 91kg, however I am currently 86kg. Details out of the way I will begin. My first experience with weed was around 3 years ago when I was 14 in year 9 going into year 10. I remember my first hit and I didn’t feel anything, I taken a couple more I didn’t feel anything. However where things really pick up is the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of recent i have been smoking at least a draw (gram) or more a day (unless I have work, in which case I will smoke a spliff [a joint] after work.) Where problems begin is my combative mindset. Depression is something which I don’t understand, I’ve been educated on it, but as person I couldn’t tell you that I am depressed, because I’ve never emotionally or physically understood the sensation of being depressed. Am I depressed? I don’t really understand or know. Trying to explain how marijuana ties into this or what I’m feeling is really difficult and complex to put into words. When sober my feelings don’t manifest as strongly when I’m high. When I’m high I feel good, but I cannot escape the wave of what I can only describe as feeling of ‘head in hands’ feeling. Like when you feel shitty you just your face with your hands. I think about my past life, my regrets mostly, and I can’t escape that mindset. But it doesn’t feel like depression? If anyone could help with what I’m feeling or what’s happening I would love to hear your opinions. If I get any responses I will get back to you ASAP however as of posting this I will be working soon. I finish at 10pm UTC.

p.s I still feel those emotions when not high but it’s a lot easier to ignore and move on with things.",2

I smoke cigs every day, but it gets worse from time to time and i start smoking more for some period of time before being able to cut back down (made a post on its own about smoking cigs, asking for only advice on how to cut back/quit)

Ive started to have those feelings again, where i really just want to buy something in excess again and abuse it. Ecstasy hasnt been my go to for months, as it once was because i used too much of it, not having enough breaks inbetween rolling but i find myself counting down the days from my last roll that ended up in pretty bad withdrawal and looking into buying crystal MDMA, in hopes that would hit.

Never had the same problem with weed or alcohol tho, obviously i need more and more compared to what i would need to get the desired feelings at first, and my resistance to them grows when i get into a habit of use for a couple of months before stopping abusing weed or alcohol.

Ive also looked into other substances that could be my new go to, partly because i want to experience different substances out of curiosity, but knowing that if i do find a drug that gives me a good high/feeling id most likely start abusing that, as alcohol and weed are starting to get repetitive and dull to me.

Makes me basically feel like shit on all levels, physical and mental.


Ive been smoking for a few years, and at many points ive been able to cut down the amount i smoke from a pack/almost a pack about 10 cigarettes or less a day.

But now, after having some very stressful life events, that have been thankfully mostly sort out, i smoke almost if not a full pack that contain 26 cigs (the previous pack a day smoking i mentioned was with a basic 20 cig pack). Normally i buy and smoke loose cigs, cus its cheaper and gives me more cigs, but i had a point in time recently where i got a carton of cigs as a gift and realised how many i smoke a day and how a big pack of cigs wouldnt even last me 2 full days. Id be able to smoke as many cigs ""needed"" the day i opened the pack, but was left with nothing or max 4 cigs for the next day.

Obviously my case isint the worst out there when it comes to the bad habit of smoking, but ive gotten to the point i sometimes get almost nauseous from smoking so many cigs in a short amount of time, and my go to when i have nothing to do is go smoke a cig or a few on my balcony and this is really taking a toll on me in many ways. It makes me feel worse, mentally and physically.

Is there any advice you people would have to give me? Maybe something to do instead of smoking, or some trick that helped you to motivate you to cut down or completely stop smoking.?

I've been aware of this issue for about 5 years now.

I drink coca-cola. A lot. the amount can go up to a gallon a day.

It's started affecting my mental health, making my anxious and nervous. I'm afraid of the physical effects, and not working, it's eventually going to affect my financially as well.

I've tried replacing it with other things to no avail, I've tried shock therapy and I am fully aware of the physical damage it is causing to my body.

I really want to stop, but I don't want to stop.

2020-07-21 08:37:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hv6lvc/my_crazy_freaking_story/,My crazy freaking story.,"So, I posted this in r/pornfree, but I think that it is applicable to all addictions, so I posted it here as well.

I think I have a unique story about porn, and decided to share it. 

This all starts way back when I was a kid, and I mean a little kid.  Like 4.  As a very young child I had visions of half-naked women, fantasies, in my dreams and every day life.  I don't know if anyone has ever dealt with something like that at such young age, without any understanding of sex or why they felt that way.  The fantasies felt wrong, but I didn't know why, or why they were occurring.  I grew up in a christian household, where I was always shielded from porn.  Not ovedshielded like some people, but shielded, as a young child should be.  I've heard people say that we are not born with sin, that we are not born with struggles, they are adaptations gained over time.  I simply cannot believe that is true.  I had no reason to see those things, no reason to feel that way, but I did.  I do not know why.  It does not matter.  

As a child, until I was probably ten or eleven, my family did not have wireless internet.  We lived in the country, and we had a USB drive for an internet signal.  Because of this, whenever I was in area with internet, I only wanted to be watching youtube and playing video games.  I had my problems with responsibility and honesty, as many children do.  One year, when I was about seven, my family and I went on vacation to a rental cottage with wifi.  I stayed up later than I was allowed in my room looking for books on my kindle.  One title that popped in my feed was something like ""100 tips for great sex"" or something of the variety.  It had a scarcely clothed woman on the front.  I was curious, and attracted.  A few months later, I looked up ""sex"" on my Kindle Fire at my grandparents house on bing.  The first thing that popped up were images of women with little clothing on.  It wasn't full nudes yet.

By the time I was eight or nine, I had discovered fully nude images, and porn videos.  I tried to watch them every time I had access to wifi.  I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I did not know why.  By the time I was ten, we had ten gigs of internet each month.  I watched more frequently.  By the time I was eleven or twelve we had unlimited wifi.  I was addicted.  I discovered masturbation, and masturbated three to five times a day.  I was a mess.

Soon, I became depressed.  My constant drive for porn, combined with few friends, and being a very sensitive kid sent me into a terrible depression.  I had two or three close friends, and I've always been an extrovert that loves to be around people.  It was hard on my.  I fell into a dangerous cycle, sometimes referred to as a positive feedback loop. I was depressed, so I watched porn, which made more depressed, which made me watch more porn, and so on.  I attempted suicide at least once.  I would lie in bed, using every bit of courage in my body to not end it all.  I can remember one time when I tried to slit my wrist.  A combination of a lake of courage and a very dull pocket knife kept me from slitting it.  It may not have killed me, but I thought it would, and I wanted it to.  

Around this time, my mother revealed to me that  she had been married once before my father entered the picture.  She had been married to a porn addict who was a musician.  He left her because he did not love her because of porn.  He told her that.  This freaked me out.  He was a musician.  I am a musician.  He was addicted to porn.  I was addicted to porn.  It was at the very least an insane coincidence.  I now knew why porn was evil, why it was wrong.  But I could not stop.  I resolved to never watch porn or masturbate that very night.  I broke my word the next day.  I was in as deep as a man could be.

But my social life was improving.  I had gained many social skills in 6th and 7th grade, and had a wide array of friends, including those that had once been my enemies.  (I will not claim they were bullies, or that I was bullied because I deserved it all, and was equally mean to other children.)  I was still depressed, but I had happy moments.  By the time I was fourteen, all the depression I had left was result of my sexual desires and addictions.  

Soon, my life changed.  I met a girl and fell deeply in love, or at least as deeply in love as an 8th grader can be.  The only problem was, the feeling was not mutual.  I was kind, and the girl, whom I will refer to as ""Sally,"" and I were friends, but I had some work to do.  First of all, I was overweight.  I needed to lose around 60 pounds.  Second, and most obviously, I was addicted to porn.  I came from a christian home, but at the time, was certainly no christian.  I knew that I could never hold a girl and watch porn.  At the same time, Sally was a devout christian.  Her dad was a pastor.  She posted bible verses on social media.  I began to study the bible and pray more often.  I wasn't entirely interested in God, more of what God could give; I wanted to impress Sally.  

Ome day, one of my friends invited me to a youth group sleepover sort of thing.  One of her friends also invited her.  I realized what a fool I was that night, and vowed to never look at porn again, and to lose weight.  I can remember thinking the next day, ""This is going to be just like every other time, I'm going to go home and jack off, and never be clean.""  The weird thing was, I didn't.  But I still thought It was a fluke.   I had gone a few days free of porn before, but always failed.  But a few days turned into a couple week, and then into a few months, and I finally believed.  I became a christian sometime in that span.  I lost 60 pounds in three months.  I was a happier and healthier than I had ever been, spiritually, mentally, and physically.  I believed I had found my soul mate.  But I didn't.  I chased Sally for a year and a half, and she never liked me.  Worse than that, I had made her feel.awkward, and she would not even talk to me.  I lost her friendship.  I persisted though, believing that she was the one, because God used her to cleanse my addiction.  Deep down inside, I think the real reason was I feared I would relapse if it didn't work out.  It didn't.  And I did sort of relapse.  I masturbated for about three days.  I hated God. I was angry.  But I snapped out of it.  I found another girl, and realized I could move on.

I still struggle with sexual temptations and desires, and I do occassionally relapse. Maybe once every three months or so I masturbate.  But I am never addicted.  I have not watched porn since that night I swore off that demon.  I stopped cold Turkey, and as cold turkey as possible.  I am clean.  I have not dealt with weight issues or depression either.  

I believe God saved me from porn.  Maybe you don't.  But I'm sure there is something you can take from my story.  Inspiration that you aren't alone, proof that you can stop, that will CAN end your struggles.  Remember that willpower is only as strong as the will behind it.  I always had the power to stop, it just took me seven years to find the will.

There is a darkness to my story, though.  It is simply s miracle that I could stop watching porn.  I was incredibley addicted.  I should not have been able to stop, and I think 90 percent of everyone in my situation wouldn't have.  I became addicted at a young age.  I was in *first grade.*  That should not happen, and parents do not expect it to happen.  Parents do not know how to protect their children, and in trying to do so actually lead them to trying it sometimes, and others fail to prevent it at all.  I wish I knew the answers.  Porn is easier to get a hold of than ever.  Children and teens can get hooked so easily, it's insane.  Right now, there are no good answers, I wish there were.  There is no one size fits all solution.  All I can say is, good luck, get help, and stay protected.  Build walls around yourself.  It's up to *you.* Not your friends, teachers, or parents.  Just you.  Good luck, and God bless.",2

It gradually built, spending the last two years of high school smoking weed and drinking. Never allowed to be a regular occurrence due to my being a minor and parents who wouldn't allow it. I listened until I turned 18. 

From the age of 18-20 I abused cough medicine. Having no real experiences with any substances outside of the fore mentioned, I was eating 32 triple C's a night. Once this ended, I smoked lots of pot and dabbled with pills. Next came the raving and bars by 22. This lasted years. Many a story to tell from that period of time. 

Recently, a substance brought my mental health and entire life to its knees. Her name is heroin. I had used heroin briefly between the DXM abuse and party drugs/alcohol. I hadn't used her in a decade. Since last year, a daily habit began. Not wanting to use needles, I only would sniff and smoke. The longer I used, the worse my mental health became. I was late to work daily due to psychotic behaviors that would not ebb off until hours later. I ended up in therapy and diagnosed. I still used. It had become the devil on my shoulder. I began to get in trouble at work and doing things that were not of my character. I had become heroin. 

June 22nd marks the week my life was changed forever. Monday I wrecked my car during a bad rainstorm, my chipped front tooth fell out showing the rot and decay, and Thursday I was suspended from work (Still don't know why as they wouldn't tell me at time of suspension). I left work that day in a daze, numb. She called to me but I said no, the damage had been done. I went and resigned that day, citing feeling unsafe in the working conditions during covid (Which is 100% true) and mentioned there was more but did not feel they needed to know about my health at that time. 

Instead of fixing up my temple, I took a wrecking ball and knocked it down. In these cases, there is no choice but to rebuild. I am connected to a treatment team for co-occurring disorders and am on medication. I drank and did meth over the weekend. The awful feeling in my body and mind is what led me to post a snippet of my story and how hard it is to struggle with this illness. 

I just need to know I'm not alone right now. Thank you.",7

My ex and I broke up recently, due to complications in our relationship. We were perfect until this year, but it was due to her change in body condition, mood, and attitude. I thought it was mainly due to life stress, work stress, family issues, and then COVID causing lockdowns in Canada. We tried making it work for several months but finally called it quits as she said ""she couldn't do this to me anymore"" in the end. She wasn't abusive, but her personality changed and was criticizing me a lot on small things. She realized the wrong things she's done and wants to find out who she wants to be.

She's from a traditional Korean family and was always told what to do in her life and how to live. This includes her work life as well. I always let her be who she wants to be/act but I think she had a view of me that was too 'goodie-goodie'.

What I'm coming for advice for is that I believe she's starting a drug abuse issue. I didn't realize it until recently. She said when she went to parties/clubbing with her friend, her friend's friend who is a drug dealer was there. Now I know of this guy from a convo before, and he mostly deals MDMA. The signs of usage were there in my ex: depression, sad, slow, forgetful, tired a lot, and sleeping late + waking late (like past 12 pm noon), and losing a good amount of weight. I then put two-and-two together because a few months ago she started getting random rashes all over her body and pimples on her face. This girl takes skincare to a whole new level and it was a very odd occurrence, as she didn't change her diet, environment, or products. I then found out that drug use can cause rashes (if the liver is having issues) and pimples as well. I feel like crap that I didn't catch it before, but as I said, I put it towards all these life stressors.

I told her before that she needs to cut this guy out of her life, and shes knows he's a bad dude but I feel like she can't. She has even isolated herself from her best friends in the last few months too. I know she's no longer my responsibility and I know she needs to accept that she wants help to get better, but I don't know how to go about it anymore.  I truly love and care for her still, if I knew, I wouldn't have broken up with her (it was very civil and we still text once a few days).

Any advice would be appreciated!

Edit: I've realized that I lacked some detail in the original post. We are not entitled to this money, but my wife was named the executor.

Recovery really is a lifestyle and lifelong process.,"I’m two weeks out from a 6week inpatient program (my first time and I don’t want to do this again). It wasn’t until the 5th week when I clued in that it was just a glorified detox and that recovery is where the real work and healing happens. 

Friends and family that have a limited understanding of addiction and recovery expected that I’d be “fixed” after 6 weeks. Who the hell gets all their problems fixed in 6 weeks?! Considering you’re detoxing for a part of it and can’t think about much except how much withdrawals suck, 6 weeks isn’t very long.
There are those who wanted me to change and now with the changes I have made, well, I didn’t change the way they wanted me too.

Establishing and now maintaining boundaries is hard outside of the safety of my rehab bubble. 

Keeping myself distracted when triggered needs to be respected (those cravings hit hard, my brain is working very hard to get me to use). 

Establishing new habits and routine takes a hella lot of time, especially when it’s your entire life you’re changing. Making new habits isn’t done in just one month or two...or three....it can be upwards of a year to establish new habits and routine, and then some if you’re doing a whole life makeover.

The brain takes approximately 3 years to heal from substance abuse and that’s with complete abstinence and of course, feeding it healthy things in recovery (water, nutritious foods, healing traumas, sleep, exercise, knowledge, gratitude, positivity....). 

This has been a huge eye opener to me for myself. As well as having a lot more respect, empathy and understanding for those who are in recovery. 
Now that cliche of one damn day at a time has become very real for me.

Quickly into my career I decided to turn my perspective around and try to help the weak, alcoholic, substance users and vulnerable people in the communities I worked  

It was well into my career when ptsd, depression and alcoholism/addiction started taking over my life. 

To be honest I never thought that I had ptsd. In the line of work i was in, you have to put on your game face. Laugh at things that are actually sad. Stay strong no matter the fear you may have. Kids from the streets that I use to play basketball with or buy ice cream for began dying. Be it to substance use or gang life. People I use to have coffee and conversations with were the bodies I was finding when doing welfare checks. PTSD isn’t for our line of work.  It’s for soldiers. Or so I thought. 

Whether it was the ptsd or depression that led me to alcoholism-addiction or the other way around. I’ll never know. 

A while ago now I was at a local convenience store in uniform near a community where I was working. 
When I went into the store I saw a homeless man, whom I knew from the community. I used the bank machine and quickly took the 160 dollars out and left the store. 

A few minutes later he was chasing me down the road. I stopped and he asked me how much money I took out. I told him after hesitation. He then asked me to count it. I did and found I was 40 dollars short.   The man held up his two hands with 20 in each and gave me back the money. 

I was astounded that this man who lived in our stairwells, addicted to heroin and fentanyl who had nothing but hustling to make money returned mine. 

I wrote a small blurb about it on Facebook and told him I did. He asked me to tag him so his mom didn’t think he was such a bad guy. 

About a month goes by and he adds me on Facebook, I tag him, and my messenger on Facebook explodes from his friends and family including his mother who thought he was dead after not hearing from him for two years. 

She flew from Cape Breton to Toronto and began her hunt for her son. She looked all day with no luck then by some miracle, he walked past her on the street and said “hey I know you, your my mom”

She cleaned him up and sent him to a rehab center across the country in Vancouver where he got sober and is still sober over 2 years later. 

Meanwhile I was struggling with my own issues and burning my life to the ground. I found I became addicted to addiction long before I became an addict\alcoholic. 

I was unable to keep myself sober. I tried my hardest. My family and friends couldn’t help me. No matter how hard I had tried the alcoholism had taken over. I isolated myself from my kids, family and friends. 
I lost almost everything   Finally when I hit my bottom I reached out to the “once upon a time” homeless man, as well as the people I had met through him including members of the treatment Center. 

They had me there within 2 days. 

I’m clean and sober today. The fellowship is now a group of my brothers and sisters I may have fallen a few times but I keep standing. 

YOU PEOPLE are MY PEOPLE
ALL PEOPLE are my people

Before all of this I’d drink here and there to feel happy when I was sad and now I just do it to feel anything. I’ve lost most of my friends since I can’t really go out with a broken ankle and some do come by my house, id say they’re bad influences but I’m not really influenced by anyone other than my boredom. One of them vapes so I knew that he was my in and asked him to buy me one in which he agreed. I had just decided to buy a vape.  Before this I said that shit was gay and stupid and useless. I was wrong. And so now I’m also addicted to the nic buzz. That very same friend also bought me some edibles a few days later.

So I have a very addictive personality, but I don’t feel the need to drink every night. However when I do drink, I can’t just have one, and then from there everything always just goes to shit. 

Last night I went to a strop club and spent almost 1000 dollars that I don’t have. We started drinking at a Mexican restaurant and it eventually just went to scoring some cocaine, drinking, then the strip club. 

I’m so ashamed of myself. I’m about to start an incredible job, assuming my drug test came back negative. I’ve been free of marijuana for 17 days with no intention of smoking again for a very, very long time. I know my hearts in the right place but I used my roommates pee to pass the test. I had to keep the pee room temperature overnight and then I use the hand warmer trick. I know people are going to judge me and make me feel shitty but I did what I felt like I had to do because I know in my heart I’m done with weed, so I might not even pass it at all. 

I feel like I can say no, but the problem is when o drink I just go completely off the rails, like I’m a completely different person who makes terrible decisions. Obviously I should stop drinking right? I know I can do it but am I a piece of shit? So I not deserve this dream job? Am I a terrible person? I haven’t told anyone besides the friends who were with me. 

I guess I just needed to vent and to know if truthfully, I’m as disgusting and despicable as I feel like am. Am I too far gone? I’m 28 years old with so much potential but is it just too late for me?",3

I’ve worked around addiction in law enforcement for more than half of my life. 
I’ve seen good people do evil things. All for that next fix,  I’ve seen people sell their most precious belongings. I’ve seen them sell themselves. All for that next fix. I’ve seen violence against each other, seen stabbings, seen shootings. seen unspeakable deeds. All for that next fix. 

I have seen you rob, steal, lie, cheat, struggle, suffer, cry, relapse and die. 

You probably don’t know me but I’ve been you——

I’ve lived in depression, anxiety, ptsd, childhood trauma, sexual abuse, sadness and addiction. I can’t explain or understand why. I came from a happy home. I was part of a happy family. I too have burnt my life to the ground. I too have chosen myself and alcoholism over the things I love the most. I too have relapsed when everything was good. I too have stood yet fallen again. I too have done things out of character...all for that next fix. I too have thought ending it all was my only option.  I too am powerless. 

But I have stood up. It’s been hard but I continue to try.  I continue to fight. 
I’m far from perfect, extremely far but I’ve learned I can do this. I can be the inspiration to others as others have been to me. I learned no matter how bad it gets, there is still hope and we can all inspire and motivate each other. 

You probably don’t  know me but I am you——

I have my history of drug abuse but nothing has changed me like the H. All I wanted to do for months was smoke that shit and play video games. I've stopped for weeks by myself but I slipped up and hung out with my old friends and they noticed me being overly sleepy. They asked me what I was on and I was half asleep and told them I suppose. Now my whole family and girlfriend know as of Friday.

It's not easy even with people watching my every move. It makes it more tempting to just run away and not look back because I'm the type to live on my own terms. I know I'm not myself when I'm high if I wanted to be myself I would be sober 24/7 on my own. This is so hard but I have hope.

I'm going to the beach now.

2020-07-19 13:57:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hu4sa4/im_tired_of_being_told_theres_a_way/,I'm tired of being told there's a way,"Reality shows that most of us do not make it. Many of us who make it do not have happy lives. So why are we told by twelve step programs and doctors and therapists that there's a way, when this is the furthest thing from guaranteed? The fact that this is suppressed as 'pessimistic' or 'counterproductive' is disgusting to me. 

We simply don't have the technology to accomplish high success levels. Why do we avoid acknowledging this? Why am I told that my recovery is my responsibility when we also acknowledge that it's a disease beyond our control? 

Why is it so hard for us to admit that we don't know what the fuck we're doing? Money, probably, and its attendant motives. But there's more than that. There are people who have recovered and are happy who tell me that I can have the same thing, as if it's just a matter of willpower, or, entirely contradictory, a matter of going to twelve step meetings, or a vivitrol shot, etc. etc. Nothing in life points to the idea that this is remotely true. Willpower does not make you president of the United States. Going through steps doesn't guarantee that I'll become a famous movie star. Talking to a therapist doesn't guarantee that I'll be happy. So why the fuck do we say these things about sobriety? Why do people in twelve step programs, which have been proven to be no more effective than other forms of social therapy, force them down our throat? 

Current treatment is still extremely primitive. In two hundred years they'll look at the futility of what we were trying to accomplish given the tools at hand, and the facts--i.e. the recovery statistics--will be a matter of simple deductive reasoning. 

Some of us have serious biochemical issues that can't be treated, or treated effectively, to make us functioning members of society. That's called who we are. Given that we haven't figured out a way to rewire ourselves to become who we want to be, why would we think we can all achieve this with addiction given the tools we have? Some of us keep relapsing and we just don't know why. This needs to be addressed. The more we peddle the existing treatments as the only answer, which we absolutely do with twelve step programs and other forms of treatment, the more we alienate addicts. 

I know this isn't a popular thing to say, but I'm tired of the lies. The recovery industry and its disciples give me false certainties every fucking day. Doesn't it tip anyone off that there are a hundred conflicting variations of them? That no one can even agree whether it's really a disease? That we literally argue semantics over it? 

I've been mainly sober for almost a year. I've taken a couple benzos and smoked weed here and there, a handful of times maybe. I haven't hurled myself off the precipice by doing this, as so many have guaranteed I would if I ever picked up anything again. I'm not saying I won't, I'm saying that you don't know if I will, despite your slogans and your certainties. If I consult ten different 'professionals,' I'll get ten different opinions. 

There's no solution for my problem right now. There probably won't be for another lifetime, at least. I'm almost as frustrated with the cultish attitude of recovery as I am the addiction itself. It's people. We're just fucking stupid. 

More than anything, I'm tired of people blaming the addict for not being happy in sobriety. It's the penultimate hypocrisy, to say that we're powerless over drugs and alcohol, but that if I can't find happiness in sobriety--the very thing that led me to drugs in the first place--it's my fault. 

There's no such thing as guarantees. Get over it.",3

Excessive use got out of hand when I turned 20.

I abuse mostly downers, I mixed it with some uppers hours ago and I been feeling like thrash. Today I just can sleep all day and I can't use because I gotta do something. The rest of my stash is worth almost nothing, I could easily flush it down.

I'm trying to turn this into a chance of maintaining sobriety but I don't know how to do it. ""Just for a day"". I can do it just for a day. And a couple more 24s. It's that week-two week range I can't over. All the thoughts of ""what's the point of stopping if life is equally miserable or more"" appear. Then I go back to using, depressed, and binge for weeks, or months, and it's been like this for years.

I go to NA meetings and hear way more than sharing but I don't consider myself NA and I don't write steps, despite having read the book multiple times. For personal reasons. I might practice them involuntarily, but I don't write them.

Right now I feel tired, I just want to sleep, wake up, do some exercise and pretend these last months haven't happened, and keep it that way. Haven't eaten in more than 48 hours and I'm not even hungry.",37

I only smoked once about... Two or three months ago, just to try, and I never felt attracted to cigs since then. 

Yesterday, during a party, I learned a very, very displeasant information. I was incredibly angry and usually I don't know how to express anger. But my first reflex was to practically destroy my friend's room saying ""I need to FUCKING smoke"" until I could find my cigs that I asked her to keep for me. When I found out she had smoked half of them I screamed and threw her stuff on the floor. And I wasn't even angry at her for smoking my cigs, I was just angry that I had only two cigs to calm down. And it did calm me down but it wasn't enough, I was really craving hard.

I just woke up and I think I'm still a bit irritated and cigs are the first thing I thought about. Right now I just want to ask money to my friend so I can buy the cigs she owes me because i just need to smoke to calm the fuck down. And I never even craved cigs between my first time and yesterday. Is it considered addiction if it's only when I'm angry? For my friend, who tried for the first time at the same time as I did, she smoked the cigs I left her only when she was feeling depressed. And she described it as a craving too. Is craving considered addiction or are we fine?",2

I was doing(sniffing)2 bags a day prior to getting clean(i was clean for 3 months). I started on day 1 of my relapse with 2 bags which felt ok but too mild for my liking so I did 3 bags (the thing where they say do less when u relapse never applied to me my tolerance sticks like a motherfucker no matter how much clean time I have). The next few days I kept it at 3 bags but soon that wasnt enough so I went up to 4 bags a day. The usual time for withdrawal to kick in for me before used to be well over 12 hours from my last use. Now I started getting withdrawals every 6 hours these past few days and today withdrawals every 2-3 hours which has led me to using 6 bags a day. I went from 2 bags giving me a buzz to 6 bags necessary just to avoid violently sickening withdrawal (I get shaken to my core sweat through my sheets wanna put a bullet in my head all that great stuff) in just 10 days. Any advice on managing or lowering tolerance ? How many bags a day do you use? How many would you think too much is? Im a 27 year old female 250 pounds for reference.

I can always tell when she’s off because she gains weight which I consider her normal size. And when she uses, she becomes very skinny and usually doesn’t contact me very often and lives alone.  

A big indicator that this was happening is she would nod off on my couch in the middle of the day and have dirty black fingers and black marks on her arms as well as a very deep cough that sounded like bronchitis almost which has persisted for many years.
And since we’ve smoked weed together, she’s always blamed it on that, but the cough isn’t the same as mine. Hers sounds deep and painful. 

However, now, I saw her for the first time in a few months and she is skinny again, but when we talk she is very alert it seems like and I don’t catch any nodding off. The only indicators I can see are black and dirty fingers tips and the reduced weight. (30-40lbs) I also know for a fact she doesn’t exercise. 

I’ve asked her about the dirty fingers before and she said it was because of having to do cleaning at work. Her job is computer repair and maintenance, though. 

Do regular users of heroin eventually stop nodding off when they get tolerant to the drug and also, can I help her after all this time?

I’ve tried in the past and she’s lied to me about it and tried to deal with it on her own, but this intermittent quitting and starting again worries me.",2

He was awesome.  I actually lived with him and his family during a summer while I was in college.  He has two daughters.  I have no sisters so I think of them as my sisters.  We spent that summer bonding and got really close to them.  We went to some drinking parties, had a blast ... no drugs or anything.  

Through the years, we've all gotten married and kind of grew apart.  I had heard through my mom that the older of the girls was going through a rough time.  She was diagnosed as bipolar, got divorced, was working on getting her PhD in paleontology.  She had the grades so she basically had a free-ride scholarship. What the scholarship didn't cover, my uncle paid.  One day, she just up and quit school.  No explanations given except that ""life was hard"".  Understandable.  

As my uncle was dying from cancer, family came in two weeks prior to say their goodbyes.  My cousin didn't go into his sick room because she claimed she contracted a parasite by working on a paleontology project.  Strange, but ok.  Family just accepted that and took her at her word.  They are from a small little church-going town in Georgia. 

My cousin did not make it to the 1:00 pm graveside service for her dad's internment.  Okay, maybe she's overwhelmed with emotion.  Understandable ... sort of.  She showed up to the reception at 6PM.  With her dog.  I took one look at her and it was painfully obvious that she was tweaking.  She has the ""meth teeth"" and the scarred and pitted ""meth acne"" along with open weeping sores all over her face.  It broke my heart.  She went into rapid fire, ""No hugging because COVID"" and she was talking non-stop, very manic energy ... changed her shoes twice and this was after only 5 minutes into her pulling up.  No one said anything to her.  I guess they all bought her parasite story?  Her dad's nurse had given her some antibiotics or probiotics to help with the ""parasites"".  I listened to my cousin give her a list of reasons why they would not work on her.  It made me angry to listen to her BS with these folks but more than that, it made sad because no one seems to see what is really going on.  The family was the go-to-church every Sunday, kind of family and my uncle had the biggest kindest heart in the world.  No-one would ever think one of his kids had fallen this far down the rabbit (meth) hole.

I couldn't stay long as we had an hour drive to a hotel in a bigger city, then an early morning flight back home.  I just cannot get the visual of her out of my head, or my heart.  She was a gorgeous girl with the most beautiful skin.  She is now thin as a rail with no teeth and oozing sores on her face.  One of her eyebrows is nothing but a bloody open wound.  

My uncle was the only person who would check up on her.  My aunt won't.  She's ""overwhelmed"" and has narcissistic personality disorder.  I want to help but live 18 hours away.  I want to send her a text and tell her that I KNOW what is going on and I will be there for her when she's ready to start facing her truth head on.  I don't want her to think she's alone with no-one in her corner.  No judgement, only love.  I want to be there for her the way her family was always there for me.  

Is there any hope? Should I go with my gut and text her ... Not giving her a chance to lie to me?  Or should I just hope and pray that someone comes into her life to ""reach"" her?   

Any advice would be gratefully accepted.  Thank you.",5

I’m talking 100 whipped cream chargers a day. 

I found him passed out and unresponsive last weekend and when he came to (after I was finally able to shake him awake) I told him not to do that shit anymore. So he started sneaking out to the garage to do it. Obviously I noticed and told him he can’t use at all while living here. So he started disappearing to his friends every day. 

Well, apparently he binged pretty hard Thursday night. Inhalants, coke and even tried heroin (his excuse: everyone thinks he uses heroin so he might as well try it) Yesterday he had a bad seizure and ended up at the ER. 

I found a rehab we can afford that has open beds (I’ve been searching all fucking week) and I told him he either goes there or moves out. I know this is the right decision for my own mental health but I’d feel guilty as hell if I kicked him to the streets. Literally, he’d be homeless because of his financial situation.

I am his 34 year old sister and am married with 2 young children.   We just recently discovered that my brother is addicted to heroin, or “scrambles”.  Although he seemed fine, he apparently has been doing this for years and we didn’t notice. It’s recently come to light that he’s even had these heroin filled pills in the same home as my two kids as he lived with my mother (since our father passed in 2018)  and she babysits my kids.  How it came to light was that he was acting like a zombie and dropped these capsules next to my toddlers toy chest.  Needless to say, my mother told him that he needs treatment and his response was that he will just move out.  

Ever since then, he’s been giving excuse after excuse to my mother and I. He’s broken into her home but the cops will not arrest him because he was living there.  They said that he has to physically harm her in order to arrest him. 

Since he gave the Officers his photo ID, he’s now lost it and cannot find it.  He keeps calling my mom and I asking if we can use our photo IDs to sign him into a motel. We know it’s because he wants to do more heroin because he’s already taken advantage of our cousin by doing this and inevitably wound up back at the motel. 

I refuse to give him “help” for shelter just because he wants to snort more heroin.   I’ll use my ID to sign him into a facility or hospital. But not to enable his drug use.   He’s now saying if he commits suicide , it’s my fault. 

Am I wrong or incorrect in not helping him get a motel for him ? I don’t feel that it’s really helping him heal, just helping his addiction.  Any help is appreciated.

***UPDATE ——*** I didn’t give him the ID. He got somebody to get him the room , but while he was going back and forth he got beat up badly. Called us this morning and said he needs help and wants help.  So we now have him safe and going to be having him willingly go through programs to help keep him clean.  Thanks y’all for your advice and reassurance during this new and difficult time.",41

2020-07-17 15:39:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ht2c47/when_your_adult_child_has_a_drinking_problem/,When Your Adult Child Has a Drinking Problem,"# As a parent of an adult child who has a drinking problem, you want the best for your child.

Unfortunately, things are not as simple as they once seemed and life now is very confusing. Although you still have the same love for your child, once they reach their 18th birthday they are legally considered an adult.

### Feelings of Helplessness

Watching an adult child, whether they are 18, 28, or 48, slip into active alcoholism or addiction is devastating. It can be one of the greatest challenges and weigh heavier on your heart than anything else that you have faced in your life.

When your child is a grown adult, parents do not have the same control they had when their child was young. Although you don’t have the control, you still have the same paternal and maternal feelings, worries, and instincts. Parents often feel helpless and hopeless, but there are things you can do to provide support and stress the need for treatment.

### Learn About Substance Abuse and Addiction

[Alcoholism](http://blog.stjosephinstitute.com/what-is-a-functioning-alcoholic/) is a disease. If your child was sick with a disease such as cancer, heart disease, or diabetes, you as a parent would probably try to learn as much about the disease as possible. Read and learn as much as you can about alcohol and how it [affects the brain](https://waypointrecoverycenter.com/alcohols-damaging-effects-brain/) to better understand what you can do to support your child during this difficult time.

### Acknowledge that Your Child Is an Adult

Parents must accept the fact that their child is an adult and has the power and responsibility for their own decisions. They do not have the right to blame you, the parent, for their situation. They have the right to their own choices, even if they are harmful.

Is your child choosing to drink over rehab? You must keep in mind that it is their choice. The decision does not stem from something in their childhood that you did or didn’t do.

Making the right choice is their responsibility, even if they try to blame you. When a parent or parents accept the blame for their child’s substance addiction, they take the ownership of the problem away from the child. The adult child sees the “other person” as the one responsible for their drinking problem.

### Learn the Difference Between Helping and Enabling

It is very important to learn the difference between helping and enabling. Oftentimes, when a person is trying to help an alcoholic, they are actually enabling them.

According to [Very Well Mind](https://www.verywellmind.com/enabling-alcoholic-is-not-helping-63297), enabling is doing things for a person that they should and could be doing themselves. Helping is doing something for a person that they are incapable of doing themselves. When you enable an alcoholic, you are creating an atmosphere where the person feels comfortable and can continue behaviors that are unacceptable.

Keep in mind that loving your child does not mean enabling them. Always hold them accountable for their actions and behaviors. Do not give them the power to wreak havoc on, or destroy, the family.

### Be Cautious with Financial Support

Stop giving your adult child money regardless of what they tell you they need it for. Offer assistance and financial support only to the degree you can afford it and only if the assistance will move them towards a better life.

Don’t give them money that you know will take them farther away from recovery. For example, if your son or daughter says they need money for food but you are not sure if they are going to use the money for that purpose, buy them groceries instead.

When you minimize financial support, you stop shielding them from the natural repercussions of their actions and behaviors. They won’t change if there are no consequences for their actions.

### Provide Treatment Options

Learn about the help that is available for your child. Be prepared to answer questions and provide real information. Offer to help your adult child find support groups, rehabilitation programs, or other support services. However, don’t be upset or blame yourself if your adult son or daughter refuses to use them or get the help you know they need. Remember that you cannot help someone that does not want to help themselves.

Although your child is grown and responsible for their own decisions, they need to hear from you. They need to know that they are not alone and that you are aware of what is going on. They need to know that there is help for them, but they have to take the necessary steps to get the help they need.

#### A Few More Tips

* Separate your child and the addiction. The addiction is not your child, and your child is not the addition. You can love your son or daughter and hate the alcohol addiction.
* Be concerned, caring, and non-judgmental.
* Let your son or daughter know how their actions are affecting you.
* Manage your expectations.
* Keep yourself and the rest of your family protected.
* Love yourself, draw your boundaries, accept your limits, and keep yourself healthy.",9

I didnt miscarry during withdrawals, amazingly, and my baby will be 3 next month. I'll hit 4 years in december. 
I recently came back into contact with my birth mother, who I thought had gotten sober, but she has not.
We work together and for a while we were stationed together but I privately asked for a separation because shed go out for first break, shoot up and stay out till an hour before our shift ended, clocked in, getting credit for my work. 
She will use heroin around me, I stink like it, and she gets whacked out of her mind the whole shift.
What really bothers me is that she knows about my past drug history, and 2 days ago she brought meth with her to combat the sleepiness of the heroin. Smoked it in the car, right next to me. 
It took everything in me to not hit the pipe. It was so hard. 
Quitting for me was fairly easy, I checked into rehab and by the time I got out, the only dealer I knew of who sold the shit was in prison and it was just a ""cant find it so whatever"" matter. I havent seen it, and have actively avoided being around people who are rumored to do it. But for the first time in almost 4 years it was almost in my hands and I hate that I almost grabbed it. 
I dont know what I would do if I relapsed. I already have a prior CPS case due to my ex husband's continued drug use after our child was born, and again because of my brother, who at the time without my knowledge was still using his drug of choice, put his drugs in her diaper bag while taking her to the park. If I relapsed itd be my 3rd drug case and I'd lose my baby. Shes the one perfect thing in my life.
I feel so helpless that a stupid little chemical has so much power over my mind, that even if for a split second, I considered destroying my life for it.",43

2020-07-16 16:24:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hshm1c/horrible_side_affect/,Horrible side affect,"I have quite a problem every time I use methamphetamine. It didn't start off like this, but little by little it progressed to the situation I now get. To put it simple I smell like straight S.H.I.T. when I use now, especially if I do not sleep. Sometimes if I use  very little after a sober streak I'm fine. But if I smoke it or take like two snifs of it my body starts to emit a really foul odor. I understand tweak reak but this is like a whole other level. I can shower 3 times in the same day(its happend) and as soon as I start sweating I start stinking BAD. I feel it has to do with the fact that my ass crack starts to sweat as well. Yet if I have the ac on and I chill out a bit so I won't sweat i still get an odor coming out of my hands,arms, everywhere else. Ive known a couple of users and none of them have this issue. Once in a while one of my friends would to vagas on a weekday and come back to work the next day without showering and with the same clothes on. He would smell sometimes but still wouldn't smell enough for people at long distances to react to the smell way before you even pass them, and that that he hot boxes his car with it. It's unreal how bad the situation gets even with at least 2 daily showers. If i also get a little hint of the smell now and then as i move or get up, I can only imagine what others smell since they aren't used to it since it is not always around them for their brains to shut it out. Has anyone else ever had this issue? If so what helped?

Edit: I've been using for heavy for 5 years with one 8 or 9 month break but then relapsed. The smell changes. Sometimes I smell like ass, amonia, like an unusual sweet smell, ive heard people say ""it smells like burning rubber, garbage, sewage, mold, shit, dick, in here"". Seems no matter how good I upkeep my hygiene it overpowers my body. Even my breath(normal for meth) but like I said I don't know another user whose breath smells so bad even with daily brushing. I have to keep mint, or gum on me ALL DAY. I can fill up an entire house with this smell, and I'm in the room with the door closed. When I open the window its not long before I hear my neighbors complaining about a smell.(I just moved to a new location in February) I feel bad for the up stairs neighbors, I heard them complaining the other day saying ""They need to get their own house on the lott"".... For some crazy fucking reason my wife cannot smell it. I tell her but she says I'm trippen. Yet the days I use her family somewhat avoids coming unnecessarily close to me. I see that they aren't trying to be mean but nothing can hide body language/facial expressions. I see that they don't wanna tell her anything, im assuming because they think that she knows but just doesn't care since we've been together for 10 years and have a 5yr old. The really sad thing is I've been able to hide my use from her all these years. She just thinks I'm really self conscious about my smell/sweat, and that I'm weird for always wanting everything enclosed.(So the smell won't go out and having to hear complaining from people who are passing by or neighbors. As if it wasn't bad enough at work all day) I used daily for 4 years up until the 8-9 month break I had. Since then I try and really limit my use since I know whats going to happen. All this week I haven't went to work because they need me to get a covid test since someone got covid and i was around him. I have been using daily since Saturday, it is now Thursday. So you can imagine how bad the smell is rite now if just one day of use leaves me smelling for at least two days.(The day of use, second day it will start coming down, and the next day it is mostly gone depending if i got enough sleep the 2nd night. I always try to eat and drink plenty of water since I am hiding it from everyone. I know I am not playing EVERYONE stupid but I try to do my best to not act lit. When I go out in public it seems most Latinos can't be played stupid. I'll hear things like "" No mames, lo que ase la pinche droga"" (Fuck, what drugs do to you). Other people just get a wif and start trying to find out what that smell is, the look on their faces when they find out its me is priceless/depressing because if they don't know its drugs they just think I'm a dirty person who just shit himself or stinks really fucken bad. (ps these masks don't even work to help that) The part I hate though is the way they look at my wife as in they can't belive someone can ever be with me, or my child as if they want to make a report to the police. I don't know if my child is as well immune to the smell, or just doesn't say anything because I am a parent. My little family is the reason I stopped for those months and the reason I'm trying to stop again. Its hard to stop when i can't even come out about it to my wife, my family, her family, the only family I can tell use themselves so there's no point if we're both under the same rock...

Back to the point though, have any of you experienced this first hand or known someone who had this problem? If so is there anything I can do(aside from the obvious sobriety). Vitamin, supliments, or maybe it's a defective liver/kidneys. Any advice aside from showering or any other smart remarks. Thanks.",4

Last time we saw each other she was pretty much normal but said that she has been thinking using again but will not do that and will go more often to the NA meetings. So I wasn't worried, she had been clean for almost 3 years and I was sure that everything is under control. She seemed happy, had just continued her studies and that had went well. 

 Now I can't stop thinking what was that last bad thing that made her relapse, would I have done something to help her if I would have noticed that everything wasn't okay. She's using subutex in IV.

Come to think of it, when I smoked I usually had two cigarettes at a time because it wasnt enough, but because I didn’t want my parents to know at the time, I smoked much less.

2020-07-16 06:02:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hs6xfr/10_years_sober/,10 Years Sober!,"“I wish I loved myself enough, not to slowly poison and kill myself through addiction!”

      Every year as my birthday approaches, I can’t help but reminisce about the events of July 12, 2010. As vividly discussed in my memoir, 1 Man, 3 Hearts, 9 Lives, that was the day on which I overdosed in my Miami condo. Unable to talk, see, or even walk straight when I shot up in bed at 5AM—it was a true Act of God that I even awoke from such a deep narcotic sleep. No matter what, I still can’t shake the daunting feeling of just how close I came to dying that night. I always think about how lucky I was to wake up, because for so many, that unfortunately isn’t the case. I think about just how sad and depressed I was in order to get to such a destructive state in the first place. I think about the devastation I caused my family and friends, inflicting such unnecessary pain on those who had to watch me suffer through my addiction. That is no way for anyone to live, and I vow never to put my loved ones through that again! 

      Today marks ten years sober from my abusing prescription pain meds! To say that I am grateful to have made it out of such a dark phase of my life is a huge understatement, because again, so many never do. I am so incredibly proud of myself for reaching such an important milestone! Especially given my current state, and the countless surgeries which I have undergone since being clean. I have come so far, and I have achieved so much in the last ten years of my life...and to think, I was so close to losing everything, all for chasing a quick and temporary sensation of false happiness. 

     I got my first taste of morphine at the age of six. At the age of seventeen, I was swallowing two Percocet every four hours, just to get through the recovery of my first heart transplant. At the age of twenty-one, I was hooked up to a PCP pump and spent eight months completely doped up awaiting a second heart transplant. When my mother expressed concern, she was told, “there is nothing wrong with a little euphoria!” At the age of twenty-two, I was told by a resident doc, “there’s plenty more where that came from,” as he pumped me full of dilaudid as I awaited a cholecystectomy. Two and a half years later, it was Vicodin that I was prescribed to get through the recovery of my kidney transplant. I finally took the plunge and snorted my first pain pill when I was twenty-six, with a group of so-called “friends,” and it was all downhill from there. Although it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when my addiction began, I can say for certain that after I graduated to crushing and snorting pills through dirty bills, I had completely lost all will power and self control. I had no idea that such a small amount of white powder had the potential to corrupt and vandalize my entire life the way that it did. I didn’t even entirely understand what addiction was, before finding myself so far gone that it was near impossible to dig myself out of that hole which I had buried myself in. I never saw it coming. This is precisely why we must educate our youth on the dangers of addiction. It all happened so fast, and before I knew it, I could no longer recognize the reflection that I saw in the mirror. Who had I become?! 

     All morality is cast aside when dealing with addiction. It is a craving unlike any other, and it is never fully satisfied. The lengths one will go to get high are quite unimaginable. You find yourself doing things you never once thought you were capable of doing. Fortunately, I was making enough money at the time of my abuse, that I never had to resort to things like stealing or prostitution. Nonetheless, I was still ashamed of my actions. As the months went by, I found that I was no longer myself—dope nodding at family functions, barely able to hold a conversation. Behaving in ways that were so uncharacteristic of my personality. It’s almost as if the real me was replaced by some sort of demonic spirit. 

     I personally do not believe my addiction to have started off as a disease. I did not have an addictive personality, nor did these tendencies manifest during my early childhood and teenage years despite my consistent hospitalizations. But eventually, the disease caught up with me. Again, my addiction was solely iatrogenic in its early stages, an inadvertent result of my treatment . I must say that in most cases, this was done with every intention of keeping me comfortable while fighting for my life. Now that I currently live with the knowledge of what it feels like to get high, it has been a constant struggle to avoid these substances. However, due to the sensitivity of my illness, I have come to realize that engaging in such activity would be about as useful as swallowing a bottle of rat poison. I love my life, I love myself, and therefore have no intention of directly compromising any of that ever again. I have already wasted too much time living in a hazy medicated fog. At this stage of my life, I have grown to know and respect my body enough to understand its limitations. 

     I can honestly look back and tell you exactly what the problems were. I am able to self-reflect, and tell you where I went wrong. I had no real self worth. I was so depressed and I didn’t even know it at the time. Therapy was not something my parents or caregivers had ever offered as a solution. I had no healthy outlets with which to process my many traumas and dark emotions. I was therefore left to battle my vices on my own, often times using various substances to numb my internal pain. I was lost in a sea of desperation, with no map to make my way out. My cardiologist was among the first to address my possible substance abuse on more than one occasion and stressed the danger in engaging in such behavior. I did my best to deny my activity; however, she knew something was off. 

     Denial, secrecy, and sensitivity were some of the main issues that that had a grave effect on me. All these years of suppressing part of my sexuality really took a toll on me. The drugs in a sense seemed to allow me the power not to worry about what others thought of me. I felt invisible in a sense, while ironically being the topic of many conversations. Alongside that was the fact that deep issues were never confronted or talked about in my family. My parents were going through an awful separation, and I started to feel as though I had nothing left to live for. Despite my parents doing everything to shield us from the destruction of their marriage, this still had a tremendous affect on me. Information was withheld in an effort to preserve our innocence, yet only to lead to its very destruction. I just wish I felt comfortable enough to voice to them, or anyone for that matter, just how much I was hurting inside. Instead, I turned to the very medicine used to subdue my physical pain, hoping it would do the same for my emotional pain as well. In reality, this only amplified my problems making things much worse! 

     Today I turn thirty-seven, thirty years longer than what doctors sat down and predicted to my parents. I’m grateful to everyone around me that said enough, and pushed me to get the help I so desperately needed. Even now, as I undergo countless hospitalizations and procedures I have my dear sister (as one example) to keep me in check when represcribed any kind of pain meds. Sometimes I get annoyed when she brings it up, and that’s always my first sign that I could be headed right back to that dangerous place, and I instantly become so grateful for her tough love. Eventually she stopped giving into my dramatic defensive reactions because her interest in my well-being outweighs all of that.

“Love yourself enough to surround yourself with people who contribute to your overall well-being and betterment!”

     Ten years sober equates to ten years of clarity. Ten years of memories, that I would have never otherwise have had the chance to experience. Ten years to see my siblings get married, and actually be PRESENT for the birth of my nieces and nephews. Ten years of incredible moments and friendship. Ten years of laughter, sadness, and everything in between. Ten years of feeling emotions rather than numbing myself to them. Ten years of being ALIVE! I have lost a total of eight, yes eight, dear friends of mine to overdose in the last year alone. To be completely honest, I’m not exactly sure what is scarier, kneeling in front of the casket of one of my closest friends, or knowing full well that, that could have been me. 

     I know some of you reading this may still be in that dark place. And let me be first to say that I know how hard the fight is. Only a true addict knows the horrors of living with an addiction. I know that so many of you don’t want to live that way, but you have no idea how to even begin to get help. There are resources all around you, you just have to be open to it. I promise you that it is not worth living as a complete shell of yourself, your brain hollow, only with thoughts of when you will get your next high. Always convincing yourself to put off getting help. There is no need to like or comment should you be someone in that very position. All I ask is that you look at me as an example that your life doesn’t have to continue on this way. I couldn’t see it for myself when I was in it, but I can promise that finally getting help was the best decision I ever made, not just for myself but for all my loved ones around me. Addiction doesn’t simply affect the addict, it also affects everyone attached to them as well. I know it’s so hard, but maybe it’s time to take that step and change things. Do it for your spouse, do it for your sibling, do it for your child, but above all do it for YOURSELF! At the very least you owe yourself that chance! Again. It’s not easy, I recognize that. All I know is I can’t bare to bury one more friend from addiction! Take the step, ask for help…because you can’t do it alone! Don’t wait, get help today! It only takes one day to be able to live the rest of your life!",94

Scum bag to artist,"Cocaine , as many of you know it's a bitch. I have been reading stories and stories and none really match mine. So I'm here finally maybe trying to find someone who has been down the path. 

I lived the crazy life,  worked at the porn shop for many years, got hooked on meth, rehab the 9s. Psych ward , almost didn't get out of it. 

Later in then found piercing it took the addiction out of me. I listed after this life. Did that for 10 years and then wanted to make the jump to tattoo artist.  But if you don't know is crazy expensive to get into. So went back to my scumbag roots and made the money on the street now licenced and I think a fairly decent artist with an ok following. I want to stop doing blow. I don't sell it anymore. But I have a life that strangely enough is super encouraged to be a scumbag rockstar. For years I been ok with that image. But I really don't love doing blow while still loving it. 

I know the usual don't talk to the people lose the numbers ext ECT. I really just am hoping to hear from someone who has been in a similar boat. I'm trying I really am. I want to be done with it. I haven't drank in 5 years , rarely even smoke weed anymore. But man give me a gram and I'm totally fine.

I am making the journey regardless but I was hoping for some mutual minded people I could talk to.  Or some good stories to help me along the way.",3

Other coping mechanisms?,"Hey, I’ve been on a path to try and get sober from weed and nicotine. I see nothing wrong with a glass of scotch or a beer after a long day’s work, but nicotine and weed have been problems for me during/throughout the day. 

I am also addicted to my phone, checking things (OCD tendencies, though easily controlled for me), buying/spending money on things like groceries (or making the occasional stop at a 7-eleven to purchase a Gatorade or something), and checking my ex’s social media. 

These are problem areas that I need to steer away from. One thought I’ve had is that if I can eliminate the avenue, it’s impossible to go down that road. 

Tonight I’m thinking about locking my phone in my car after I’ve turned my debit and credit cards off (can do this through my bank’s app). That’s really all I’ve come up with thus far (even thinking about putting my laptop in the car as well). This will literally force me to do something different/resist the urge. 

I really believe this is what I need to do. I am such a creature of habit that I’ve tried many coping mechs only to fail. I need to get rid of the avenue altogether, therefore making it impossible to travel down. 

Any thoughts on this? Any tips/advice from people who have experienced similar hardships with effective coping mechanisms?

Edit: I’d also like to add that I live in the city—could easily park my car a few blocks away. This would require a 15/20 minute walk to partake in whatever it is that’s tempting me.

Edit x2: this is probably going to be difficult with work now that I think about it, and I’ll have to buy an actual alarm clock (referring to phone addiction). Maybe I just set specific times for phone use or have a dedicated work phone? Thoughts on dedicating times?

2020-07-15 19:24:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hryl84/a_tale_of_two_tims/,A tale of two Tim’s,"(The title makes sense once you realize my name is Tim) 

I met a guy also named Tim, funnily enough, towards the tail end of my downward spiral. He had been using for a little longer than me, and he was probably a little bit more into it than me. Whereas I still sometimes managed to entertain the notion of maybe not shooting heroin one day - unable to stop but realizing that I had to - he seemed to have decided on heroin as a way of life. It wasn’t simply an effective way to soothe pain and annihilate regret, it was just the best way of feeling good that he had found. How could you not perpetually relapse and always crave this feeling, he wondered. Granted, it felt wonderful, so he wasn’t wrong. But where I had constructed an elaborate (and absurd) moral justification for what I was doing, he seemed to hew more closely to the traditional idea of an addict - someone who just wants to feel good, and heroin is nothing if not excellent at doing that. Of course, I have no idea what was really going on in his head, what vagaries of circumstance and biology had brought him to this point, but outwardly, that was the impression. This isn’t to denigrate him - shooting heroin is shooting heroin regardless of how much I may have rationalized it as a logical response to the insanity of existence. He was a genuinely nice guy - one of only two people I have fond memories of from those times. I think what I am getting at here is there doesn’t necessarily need to be any sort of “palatable” reason for why one becomes an addict - certainly, there are precipitating events that can make it more understandable - but addiction can happen to anyone, especially in modern society. There are cheap thrills to be found everywhere, and we have dispensed with the old frameworks of meaning and connection that used to guide us in favor of a culture of consumerism and individualism. Is it *that* surprising that a certain type of person, having found themselves in a society that encourages competition, consumption, and unrelenting upward mobility (financial, social, and otherwise), might turn to some sort of chemical balm when their natural disposition is toward connection, meaning, and cohesion? Or even if that isn’t their natural disposition - they’d love to succeed conventionally, really - but for some reason or another they just aren’t able to. The message received by every one of us is that your worth as a human is equivalent to your economic value, which is an utterly atrocious idea. This society alienates everyone, some more than others. We all need ways to feel good, to feel valued and meaningful - it is human nature - and sometimes (or for some people, every time) - buying that new car or getting that new job fails to cut it. What to do if you are one of those people? 

Anyways, the other Tim. Nice guy with a substance abuse disorder. He even refused repayment for pizza and beer one time we hung out, which sounds like common courtesy, but let me tell you, an addict refusing an offer of cash is damn near saintly. If the pope was there, he might have been canonized. Mother Theresa would have been proud. Gandhi might’ve had something to say about it. It was really nice, is what I’m saying. 

So, anyways again, towards the end of the Dark Times, Tim had become one of my primary hook ups. He wasn’t a dealer or anything, he just went down (went down is addict vernacular for going to cop (cop is vernacular for buying drugs)) a lot, and he made enough money on the side to support his habit. That was what he was doing - he needed money to buy drugs, and if money could be made with a bit of clever arbitrage, then why not? He didn’t overcharge people, he didn’t rob people, and he wasn’t simply taking advantage of an illness to make money, as is often the case with the more traditional drug dealers (not always, but often). He *needed* this money and the drugs it got him, you understand. He needed it like people need air, or food, because without it he wouldn’t be able to function. 

He usually saw a group of guys in Baltimore. They were a mysterious bunch - you’d text a single number, be informed of a new location each day, and a different guy would serve you each time (serve is vernacular for... never mind, I think this one is obvious). It seemed like a foolproof setup, assuming, of course, that no one snitched. Which someone, of course, eventually did. So one day, the entire group got rolled up. Tim was frantic - what was he going to do? He had been getting too comfortable with them, he’d let his other connections go dormant because this one was so easy and convenient. This, it would turn out, was the least of his problems. The next day, his phone was off. And the day after that, his girlfriend contacted me with the news. 

Tim had been arrested too. Not for simple possession, not even for possession with intent, which may have at times been merited considering the amount of product he sometimes had and what he sometimes did with it. No, he was roped into a conspiracy charge. Conspiracy charges, if you aren’t aware, are the bane of addicts everywhere. They are used to essentially charge people with crimes they didn’t actually commit, or crimes that they may have had some minor part in but for which prosecution can only be justified on the basis of some “criminal knowledge” of another person’s intent. So Tim, a person suffering from a mental illness, a person who, even while suffering from this illness, remained a genuinely decent and generous guy, was charged as if he were a drug kingpin. He was charged as if he were an integral part of a city wide distribution ring, when he was in fact barely a bit player, a drug mule with a drug problem. The last I heard of him was from what his girlfriend told me. She had been living at his place, and his parents absolutely hated him - they had bought into all of the toxic myths about addiction - and they were happy - truly, deeply, transcendently happy - to be rid of their only son. She would have to go sooner or later too, the only silver lining being that she was allowed a month or so to figure out her next move. She told me that Tim was wasting away in jail - he was becoming delirious, not taking care of himself, sometimes not making sense when he talked. She had been frightened by his appearance. I tried to get his information from her so that I could maybe write him a letter, because he had checked up on me everyday while I was in the hospital, and I felt it was the least I could do, but I lost touch with her before she could tell me. An older dealer had offered her a place to stay, and her parents wouldn’t take her, and she had no money and no prospects; I think she took him up on the offer. 

So, a tragedy. A good guy is going to spend a significant part of his life in prison to repay society for having the audacity to suffer from a criminalized mental illness. His girlfriend, also suffering from this same illness, is doing god knows what, but she surely isn’t doing well. And for what? Who does this help? Surely not him. He will be made to feel ashamed - he may even come to believe that he deserves to be locked up. He will probably relapse upon being released, because his main source of treatment while inside, if any, will be the clown-show that is NA. His family may never welcome him back. The genuinely sweet girl he was with will probably not wait for him, even if she gets sober. And who could blame her? She’s young, and he will be middle aged by the time of his release. 

Who does this help? Why does this happen? How is this ok? And what if it had been me?",4

I say that it's mild because my history with alcohol and benzodiazepines was far, far worse. As of right now, I'm three months completely clean and sober. However, I have been waiting on surgery to relieve an extremely painful physical problem for over a year now. I was supposed to have surgery in May, but due to the pandemic, my surgery was cancelled and the earliest they can possibly get me in is at the end of August. My surgery is labelled ""urgent"" and is still at least well over a month away.

I've been in off-and-on excruciating pain (about one out of every five days is unbearably bad), as my condition continues to get worse. I'm finding that OTC medications are just completely unhelpful now, even at max doses. I had a frank discussion with my doctor about my pain, as well as my history with addiction, and we were kind of at a loss. He told me that if I felt it would be helpful, he would be willing to prescribe small refills of opioid medications, as they would probably help with the pain. I told him I'd think about it.

My surgeon also mentioned that simply sticking to OTC medications during my convalescence after I eventually receive this surgery would probably be very difficult (it's a fairly invasive surgery with a long recovery time).

I feel like I'm caught between a rock and a hard place. It seems like I get to choose between unbearable, traumatic pain or rolling the dice with an opioid addiction again. I'm also not really sure if even if I manage to take the medication responsibly and minimally, I can really continue to consider myself sober, and I find the thought incredibly upsetting. This is the farthest I've ever made it and it feels like now I can only have long-term sobriety if I am willing to endure months of mind-numbing pain.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone has any advice here. My best idea so far is to let my partner hold on to my medication and ensure that my doctor is dispensing minimal amounts, being sure to establish with my partner the limits of what I can use. I really, really, don't want to touch the stuff, but I feel like I don't have much of a choice. Is this just way too big of a risk? Are there any other options for me?",2

2020-07-15 11:43:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hrpwqf/dealing_with_someone_newly_sober/,Dealing with someone newly sober,"I need some insight please. My ex boyfriend (we are both 27 years old) had a cocaine addiction for many years. About 3 months ago I broke up with him after being together for 4 years because he relapsed after being clean for just a couple months. He needed to learn how to be sober on his own instead of me doing it for him. 

Currently he’s been sober for about 3 months as well. We recently started seeing each other in person again and it’s obvious we are still in love and we still have so much fun together. He will even make mentions about our future together. 

We only saw each other 2 or 3 times within the past couple weeks (And did not have sex, as I told him I wouldn’t be doing that unless we were together). 

Anyways, last time I asked him to hang out he said that he didn’t want to because he doesn’t want to feel “pressured”. But then says he feels bad for denying me when I ask to hang out. When we saw each other last he told me that he doesn’t want to feel pressured to get back together but he’s also worried that I’m going to meet someone else and so on. 

The thing is I have not pressured him AT ALL or asked when we are going to get back together. I’m in no rush to. I just simply enjoy spending time with him which is why I want to see him. 

He seems to be doing so well. He says that he’s really happy being sober and has nothing to complain about right now. Which I guess makes me feel somewhat bad since we aren’t together and I thought we had a really happy and fun, supportive relationship besides the drug issue. 

I‘m trying to be understanding and just let him be for now, but I can’t help but take it really personal that he doesn’t want to see me when I am dying inside to see him. Especially since we both seemed to really enjoy each other’s company when we last hung out. 

He says that he really misses me and is scared of losing me, yet won’t even hang out with me. He had admitted that in the past he relied a lot of his happiness on me, so maybe that’s part of it? 

Any advice? I just start over thinking and let my insecurities get the best of me. I don’t drink or do drugs FYI so it’s not like I’m a bad influence.",1

Just got out of my first rehab (two months). Been home for a bit and know I need sober living so I’ve been doing sex work to raise the first month until I get a job I can walk to from the house. I relapsed three times at rehab by drinking hand sanitizer to get drunk and I’ve relapsed on drugs and alcohol multiple times since coming home. I’m in an IOP program and hopefully will have better motivation now that I’m moving into sober living tomorrow.

I’m just really scared. Was going to drink tonight “for the last time” but this guy that I did sex work with who was going to bring me (and has been bringing me) alcohol couldn’t do it tonight and I’m not gonna drink at sober living so I guess that was divine intervention or something.

Long story short I came back in March from an Erasmus trip in Spain where I’ve done coke, ecstasy and weed like 5 or 6 times each. I’ve always been self-destructive (used to self-harm, get massive drunk every week just because, etc) but I didn’t have trouble doing drugs in Spain because I was rather happy and content. But I came back home and things weren’t going well with my parents (my mom is bipolar, she tried to commit suicide several times when I was a kid so I guess that fucked me up a bit and she’s not well these days) and I began craving doing drugs and being high, especially coke. At first I thought it was because I missed the Erasmus and the heavy partying that came with it, but for a few weeks all I could think about was getting high again. Few days I began watching Euphoria (show about drugs, very graphic) and it really triggered something in me, and now I’m craving drugs even more. I get anxiety bc while I always thought addiction was this point of no return where you would steal money from people you love and do crazy shit just to get your fix, I’m starting to realize I might be an addict if seeing drugs on TV makes me crave them? What do you think? I am this close to go take one of my mum’s Xanax and just be on a cloud for a few hours but I’m trying really hard to not snap bc I guess it all starts at this point. I’m thinking of going to a NA meeting in my city but idk, I have this stupid thought that there are addicts that are in a worse situation than me and my situation somewhat matters less?? It’s really hard to sum up in words so thank you if you read until the end and please be tolerant...

It’s always been us. But the last couple of years we’ve completely lost M. It started with her missing the birth of my first child 2 years ago and calling a week or so later to apologize and tell me she was in treatment for an eating disorder out of state. I had an inkling but really no idea. I felt terrible and tried to help any way I could. She returned home a few months later and seemed to be on track but after so many months, another call came in that she was in rehab for substance abuse. Since she’s been home, I know of at least 2 relapses where she goes on a bender for a few days. There have been a couple suicide attempts. She has a therapy system set up and is a therapist herself. But doesn’t seem to be getting any better and isn’t open about her experiences. We’re starting to catch on to a pattern of when we think a relapse is coming and we saw this one coming. A friend outside of the group reached out to fill us in that there was a relapse a few days ago where she purchased an insane amount of cocaine and had been awake and not eating for days. But when they go to her apartment to be with her and check in, she acts like everything is fine. This is a repeat of something we saw months ago with pills. She makes a claim that she doesn’t want to live, and then gets upset when we take her seriously and show up. We’ve showed up at 3am. We’ve given unconditional love. We’ve tried being honest about her behavior. Nothing seems to help. Most recently she became very attached to a social cause that has gained huge popularity. To the point of not being able to have a conversation unless it was about that. To the point of confronting us about not doing enough. To the point of calling out another member of the group specifically for her spouse (who happens to be one of the good guys). Despite us trying to explain that people handle things in different ways and we shouldn’t be judged for it, she disagreed. So we took a step back from her. I cleared the air with her at one point and expressed concern that she replaced one addiction for another. And now we got the news of this relapse. She had told me she was about 2 months sober. 

I just don’t know what to do. Do we have an intervention? Why hasn’t her therapist told her she needs to go back to treatment? What do we do at this point?",3

as with all recovery activities, i like to do my homework.  I am currently looking into psychedilics for addiction and have already had success with shrooms (on my eating issues). 

Keen to hear what others have used in this realm for healing addictions and how specifically they used the psychedilic (i.e macrodoses, micro, integration steps, intention setting etc etc)

hope that makes sense, but keen to hear experiences and learn to guide me

Started using cocaine regularly a couple of years ago and no matter how much I tell myself it will be the last time, I use it again.

My panic attacks and anxiety are the worst they have ever been in my life and because I have Asperger's I was recently turned down for cognitive behaviour therapy which I felt like was my only solution.

I have a wife and son who I live with and I do not deserve. 

I am employed and generally I am healthy and I should have absolutely no reason to use drugs. They make me feel suicidal and cause panic attacks to the point where I end up in A&E and yet I still do it.

I can sit for hours crying the following day feeling like I don't deserve to be alive and making every promise under the sun that if I survive this particular come down I will never do it again and yet I do. 

I have been for addiction counselling and it did nothing. 

I am so heartbroken for my incredible son who deserve so much better than a father who uses drugs and it's getting to the point where I feel like I am simply a burden to him and my wife. 

On the days where I haven't used (I use once every 2 weeks at the moment) our life is brilliant and we love each other and support one another but on a day where I've used or the following day it's just a pit of despair and I have so much hatred for myself and my stupidity and I just spiral into a deeply depressive self loathing mental state.

I just want to be clean and be the father and husband my family deserves but I cannot seem to beat this.

I'm sorry for anyone who has to read this I just really felt compelled to write and post this somewhere.

Thank you for listening if you got this far.",53

Helped me fill the void of loneliness during high school while taking anti-depressants (Citalopram for 3-4 years now). Although I was socially inactive, it didn't interfere with my daily tasks of finishing school projects and working at Walmart as a cashier, which was very stimulating and gotten a lot of praise for my performance.

During the second semester in college however, the classes were becoming more and more complex, and I retreated into gaming (10-13 hours daily) instead of seeking tutors, thinking I was simply losing interest in the program.

When I returned from college I suffered a [gaming withdrawal](https://cgaa.info/gaming-withdrawal-symptoms/) just two days in my new job at another grocery shop, the symptoms lasted for 2 months, and were more intense during any physical activity. 2 weeks after I started working in a new job (Municipality maintenance) in late June I felt better, and returned to gaming with a tight schedule (2 hrs max), but relaxed during the weekend.

4th and 5th July I played for around 7-8 hours, since the weather was too hot for any activity. I felt tearful on Monday, then on Tuesday the depression skyrocketed, I was on the verge of a panic attack and literally started having suicidal thoughts. I had to take two days off due to how extreme the mental and emotional pain was, and I'm still recovering from it.

Is it time for me to hang up on games? Am I cursed from playing them?",22
2020-07-12 15:26:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hq0bn2/my_brothers_meth_addiction/,My Brother’s Meth Addiction,"My brother had been doing Meth off and on for several years now. He’s borrowed close to 10k from different family members and burned them all. I’ve offered to take his cats for him when he became homeless the first time. I offered to find good homes for all 5 of his animals and he refused. We’ve tried to get him into rehab, we’ve offered lifeline after lifeline to him. 

Well, this past Tuesday he got arrested for assault with a deadly weapon.

He lives in a camper on a property, the camper is maybe 50 sq ft if I’m generous. No working shower. No running water, he has power and AC, but no plumbing. 

He has 5 animals. 2 dogs, 3 cats. The dogs were seized after the arrest (his German Shepard bit someone else on the property). 

My dad and I didn’t know how long he was going to be locked up, so we took 2 of the cats (couldn’t find the 3rd).

His camper was what you would expect of a hard addict. It boarders on a hoarders situation. But the worst part, is that the two cats we were able to get and assess are slowly starving to death. His 17 year old cat was soooo hungry. He was literally skin and bones. This was not a case of poor health causing eating issues. This was starvation. His other cat, a 3 year old, was very skinny. You could feel his spine, ribs, and hip bones with a light touch. 

My brother was released Friday due to COVID. He asked for his cats back. Threatened to kill himself if we didn’t give them back, said he has nothing to live for if he doesn’t have them.

This is a clear case of neglect. But I also know that both male cats will not make it out of a shelter. The younger one has urinary crystals and is missing his back foot, and the other is 17 and needs so much TLC.

Since we gave them back. I’ve been having nightmares. I’m a huge cat person. And to see my brother slowly allowing his cats to starve to death is just the epitome of contemptible. I will never forgive him for this, our relationship is permanently destroyed. 

For the last 2 days, I’ve been debating about reporting him for criminal neglect, and reporting him for the 8-ball of meth we found while trying to find his cats in their hiding places. 

At this point, he’s on his own. He is still in denial about his addiction, so I can’t help him with that. But I feel obligated to do something for his animals. 

Should I just let it lie? Or should I report it? I don’t know if I can be ok with being responsible for his suicide.

TLDR: brother’s an active meth addict and his animals are slowly starving to death. His senior cat in particular needs serious TLC. He got arrested for felony assault, but was  released because of COVID, so we couldn’t get the animals out of the situation. He’s threatened to commit suicide if we take them away. Should I report the neglect? (In Arizona).",2

My job in healthcare doesn't help either as it stresses the fuck out of me. I have already lost a family member who worked in the same field and I kinda fear of meeting the same faith. Quitting isn't an option due to me also being a former degenerate gambler with a big debt to pay off. Unemployment won't pay enough to meet my obligations so that's not an option either.

But this level of drinking is fucking so many things up and I can't take it anymore. I'm drunk most of the day and it have ruined so much for me, like relationsships and I'm on last notice at work due to me missing too many days due to being hungover or going into work visible drunk.

Okay, now to my situation. It definitely is full with many twists, turns and problems. I am a 27 y/o female and I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend, 34 y/o for about 8 years. Unfortunately I am a recovering heroin addict. I began using when I was about 20 and relapsed a few times since being in our relationship. I mean full on, I have ruined my life quite a few times and there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do if it meant I could take it all back. My bf does not use drugs, like zero but occasionally drinks. I got out of rehab about 6 months ago and I am trying so hard to do everything right. We both made conditions in areas that we would not budge and made very clearly what we needed from each other. Mine was pretty simple, in order for us to move forward we cannot throw each others pasts in our faces. For instance, say well you lied to me before, you're lying now.. you're a liar. Or you cheated on me so now you're a whore. Basically using my past to fuel an argument. If you're not familiar with addiction- it completely wipes away who you are. We have a very nice house, he is successful, he owns a business and also works for another company. I think I'd consider him a workaholic. Anyhow, I worked my a\*\* off to get a great job. After a month of looking, I went through a series of interviews and got a job as head of customer service. The pay is far more than I thought I would begin at and the company is phenomenal. I used to be an esthetician and I also enjoy working hard and living a happy, fulfilling life. Like I mentioned, I used to be an addict but I know I am doing great right now. I feel as though I am trying so damn hard to please him, do whatever he needs, take his advice and so forth. By no means am I asking for all of the trust back right now because I understand my faults in the past. I need to prove to my loved ones I am doing great for quite some time before gaining trust back. Anyhow, just about every other day I am getting accused of hiding things like on my phone (which I truly am not) lying to him about god knows what and constant disrespecting him. Everything that I do is considered ""weird."" In his eyes, I am just abnormal in the way I speak, eat, sit (I'm not kidding), clean the house, plant the garden, mow the grass.. etc. It gets to the point where I am constantly questioning every single thing that I do and I come to the conclusion well maybe I am ""weird"" or something. When we get into arguments he will tell me how my entire family doesn't love me, or want me. How awful I am, I can't hold a normal conversation, that I'm selfish, a bi\*\*h, whore, incompetent, lazy, dirty.. God I feel like the list goes on.. I am trying my best but I feel like I am doing terrible. Like here I am again.. questioning everything. I cannot move out because I don't have any money until I get paid, I don't own a car of my own and my parents are getting divorced so living with either one of them is not an option. The other night he pushed me off of the deck because he was angry about things that happened in the past.. then just more recently he dragged me throughout the house by my feet through the back door and locked me outside at night for like 2 hours. This is f\*cking insane, I know. I just have no options right now and I'm trying to deal with this. I'm proactively looking for things I guess to just kind of keep the peace until I can move out. Oh yeah, and my mom loves him. I mean really loves him. She thinks that he gives me the structure that I need. That's what she calls it when I explain things to her.. She says, ""Oh that's just him being him. You need to relax."" Which then leads me to feel like she is downplaying all of this so I feel okay, and live with him because she doesn't want me to temporarily live with her. So yes, I do feel pretty unwanted.. I am just trying to move on with my life, do the right things, be ""normal,"" if you will. I also don't have any friends because over time I have become out of touch with basically everyone I know within the last couple of years. Honestly, I don't talk to anyone besides my mother or my aunt too when I'm with my mom. I don't even have a facebook, or anything because my bf says that its not a good idea. I just feel out of touch and it seems as though everyone makes me feel crazy, questioning everything I do.. downplaying things I know aren't right or constantly telling my I'm doing damn near everything wrong. So yes, that's currently what is going on.. Any advice? Thank you in advance.",1

She stopped as a teen by the old “week just STOP”. As if it’s that easy when it’s a legitimate, deep seeded issue. But I really, REALLY feel that I have nothing without drugs. I’m not on anything “hard” or like... street drugs. I have chronic pain due to an autoimmune disease(s) and epilepsy. So I’ve always, since I was first prescribed my meds, had an addiction issue with them. I also have SEVERE anxiety and have self harmed since I was... shit, maybe 15? I’m 24 now. I’m always fucking miserable. And without my epilepsy medication (aka kpin, as it’s all I’m prescribed right now, and all that has made a dent in my myoclonic epilepsy), I feel as if I have nothing - no other options. 
And therefore? Absolutely NOTHING to live for. 
My chronic pain is bad. SO BAD. I know that everyone says, or claims that, but I’ve had issues with it since I was 14. It haunts me every single day.

And the only people I know who could understand what I'm dealing with is other addicts. So please hear me out. 

I'm 26 years old, I started using pain pills when i was 11-12 years old, which was a result of bullying and daily physical abuse that cost me many injuries, both physical and emotional. I used oxy's for 9 years, then I was introduced to heroin by a friend. From that point I was on heroin/fentanyl, and crack for 8 years. I can admit I lied/cheated/stole/robbed, and did whatever I had to to not get sick. 

I never set out to hurt anyone, no matter how much they hurt me. I only fought in self defense, and ended up taking a bullet one day..... I sat in the hospital, and thought I'd never escape this prison I put myself in.
    
5 months later I was working at a grain mill overnight. On my break I went and met my dealer who had a new batch of dope. At 1 am I left work, but first I sniffed a line. My memory cuts out on the highway. I overdosed driving down the highway. Somehow my car hit a metal barrier just right so when it went through the barrier at an angle and rolled over, it slowed it down to a stop. instead of going straight through it head on. 
 I was saved by a cop. I've been clean since. I have 19 months now. 

Life has been good, I found a purpose in life again. That is until today. I met a man who overheard a conversation between me and someone who was looking for help with his addiction. This man who doesn't know anything about us, except that we are addicts, made a scene and just tore us down and humiliated us. He believes all addicts are human scum, and even had other strangers stand behind him believing that we don't deserve to live. 

I want people to understand, I have had people berate me, I have been the outcast, but I have always been able to see past the insults for what they are, they are just people who don't or can't understand what it is. 
But I've never met someone like this man who believes no one can change, that we aren't bad people. 

Please understand this is not a plea for sympathy. 
I am only asking for your opinion and understanding.

2020-07-11 23:16:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hpnhad/1_cocaine_2_this_happy_ending/,1. Cocaine 2. This happy ending,"My boyfriend and I had been dating for 2.5 years. We are both 27. For about 6-8 months now we’ve been talking about getting engaged and moving in together. He even bought a ring and asked my dad. We had signed a lease on an apartment and he had moved his stuff in. I would move in after we got engaged in early August. 

One month ago we were at a restaurant with his brother and sister in law and a few friends. He had told me “go ahead and drink” and he would stay sober to drive. I drank. He drank too. When we were leaving the restaurant he said “wait, I need to run to my buddies truck real quick”. I asked..”why?” Jokingly, because I knew he liked edibles, I asked “marijuana?” He just stared at me. I asked even more jokingly: “cocaine?” he nodded yes. My world shook at that moment. I freaked out, walked to the car, got in the passenger seat. We fought about it. My first concern was that not only was he about to drive us while he had been drinking... he was about to be drunk, high, and driving. He justified this by saying: “when you do cocaine drunk it’s like you’re not drunk anymore”. My next concerns were about how long he’s been doing cocaine. He said 3 years. I asked how often.. he said about once a month. I asked him about some examples of when. Things started to match up when I realized ... that weekend he missed my sisters birthday party because he was “sick” - cocaine. When we stayed at an air bnb with a big group of friends and Sunday he couldn’t even get out of bed? - cocaine. I googled the symptoms and signs. Runny nose. That’s why he always has a runny nose. That why he said “geez my allergies are getting worse these days” and why he kept Flonase in the car. I started thinking about how he’s been angry and more distant from his family for the last year or so (when before he was a normal family guy). 

At first gave an ultimatum. Either quiet or I’m leaving. Of course he said he would quit. We argued about it again the next day and we made a deal. If he wanted to do it 1-2 times a year during a party or whatever than that’s fine. But #1 he has to tell me so that I can make sure he gets home safely or that I could go pick him up if he needed it. And #2 to make sure I am never around when someone is using it because I’m not willing to get into the legal issues if he was caught. 

A couple days ago we were arguing. We’ve been arguing a lot since I found out. He’s been picking on me and gets mad when I have fun with my friends (we stayed at a lake house and my best friend and I got drunk and played games outside- we were loud sometimes .. laughing) - my friend and I went to bed at 1am. The next morning he commented on how crazy I got and even said it was disrespectful that I was loud. He then said I shouldn’t be able to judge him for cocaine if I get that crazy (also note I get drunk once maybe twice a year). He also said “I don’t get why it’s not okay for me and Tom to do I line or 2 of coke once in awhile”. 

That’s when I found out he did coke last weekend while I was at work. We argued about it again. He got so angry he packed up his clothes from my apartment and left. Some comments I remember were along the lines of me being “crazy”, “disrespectful”, and “not having my head on right”. 

I called him the next day and broke up with him. I told him I would not tolerate lying, leaving, and drug use. 

Now I’m in the acute phase of the breakup. I know I made the right decision to end this relationship even though an engagement, a house, and a family with him was all I had wanted for a long time. 
It’s truly sad. 

I struggle sometimes thinking “if only I was this way/that way we could’ve made it work”, or “if I would’ve just let that one fight go we would still be together”.

Anyways, the history I had with this girl goes as follows; its a tad complex. Essentially I started talking to her back in late august of 2019, I had a deep connection with her, persisting until November. The reason as to why she left me THEN was due to my addiction to pills– chiefly amphetamines and occasionally opioids. Precisely, it ended after she found powdered Oxycontin residue in a tightly-contorted bag (Admittedly I lied and claimed it was sour patch kid sugar, lol). Anyhow I didn't make a big fuss of it, I respected her decision to part ways and wished her the best. Well it so happens that she wanted to get back into it come early March, four months later. At this point in my life– although a namely short interval for such a jump– I developed a SERIOUS dependence for cocaine and pentedrone. Mind you, she knew very well what I was doing throughout this time, at least with coke (Another douchey sidenote, I was the type of loser to post his ski sessions on Snapchat).

Similar to before, we developed yet another deep attachment, and she spent the night at my place for several nights. Early into our reunion she asked me if I was still 'doing that stuff'. Assuming a reference to coke, I was honest and told her I was still pretty dependent on hard stimulants. For about a month she seemed to go lax with her concerns and chiefly focused on the romance between us. One night she had asked me if there were any drugs in my room– a sudden resurface to the aforesaif concerns. Again, remaining adherent to my honesty, I told her I had roughly a gram of coke, a week's  supply of 20mg Adderall and an OC30 I'd been saving for a prolonged period of time.

She asked me to throw them away– everything. She even used the phrase ""It's either the drugs or me."" I would have done it, at least the 'harder' portion of the blend (I've been using Adderall to a truthfully responsible degree albeit unprescribed for over a year), if it wasn't for the fact that coke is so damn expensive ($80/g in my precinct). It wasn't the right thing to do, but essentially I told her I was too powerless to rid of it. Reviewing it now, is it wrong to say that she was at fault for getting herself into the atmosphere I was in?

On April 17th (The following day), I had an awful binge. I overamped, enduring a steady coke high for 9 hours. That night I had what felt to be a mini-heart attack– tunnel vision, sudden nausea, tight chest pain, shoulder blade pain, twitching in my left arm... telling symptoms. After experiencing this, I recorded myself ridding the rest of my coke and paraphernalia (Took the tape off of a rolled dollar, ran a wet cloth over a yearbook I used to ski on, thoroughly cleaned off my desk, etc.), and sent it to her, letting her know I made a decision to quit. Evidently she was upset, knowing that I did it, but equally proud to see that I made a good step (In fact I've been completely clean of coke and cathinones since that day). A few days pass and I seemed to be seldom receiving messages from her. My friend brought it to my attention that she was reportedly staying at another guy's house one night. I didn't even address it to her, but she sent me a message a few hours later, coincidentally.

Here's where the 'destroyed my hope' part sheds some light. I won't get too indepth, but disregarding the whole truth with the guy (I honestly didn't even care about that), she said some pretty damaging things to me. Not verbatim, but she told me that there was no hope for me, that my substance abuse was going to get worse, and that it will continue to build up with me– AFTER I made the decision to quit. That killed me man.

So, with that said, what does the community think? I'd highly appreciate other opinions. Thank you.",2
2020-07-11 12:37:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hpd1at/my_porn_addiction_is_slowly_killing_me_inside/,My porn addiction is slowly killing me inside,"Hey guys.  Sorry if I’m talking about this on the wrong sub.  I’ve tried pornfree and nofap but there’s just so much incel talk and people desperate for sexual relationships over there I thought I’d try this out instead.  I really just want to beat this shit so I can stop hating myself.  

I’ve been seriously trying to quit for around a year now.  I guess it’s gotten a little better.  You know I used to watch porn in public, at school, in the living room right next to my parents.  I used to mastubrbate two or three times a day and couldn’t even imagine going more than a day or two without.  Now I can usually manage a week or two.  I’ve found a decent way to distract myself with work or school or exercise.  I have days were I feel great and have no need to think about porn, but they never last.  After that week or two of feeling great I start getting these intrusive thoughts of porn, I have dreams about watching porn every night, it’s all I can think about and I just realize that maybe I’m never going to be able to beat this and just ask myself, “What’s even the point?”  

Porn was my first and only sexual relationship so it’s really warped my view of sexuality.  I can’t look half of the girls in my school in the eye because I often them in porn situations.  I realize I keep needing more violent, taboo, and disgusting porn to get aroused.  The Japanese anime if by far the worst.  I’ve watched some things that I’d rather die than do in real life.  I’ve never contemplated suicide because I couldn’t do it to my family and I really do want to get better, but sometimes I just feel like a monster that the world would be better without. 

I don’t think I can beat this on my own.  I want to talk to a therapist and join and SAA group so bad, but I’m only 17 and I could never ask my parents for help.  I’m really at a loss here.  I don’t want this to destroy my life.  I want to stop.  I just don’t know how.  

Anyways thanks so much if you took the time to read this, and it’s completely fine if not.  It just helps to write out these feelings that I can’t share with anyone in my real life.  Sorry again if I’m in the wrong place.  I know all of you dealing with drug addictions are probably in a lot more pain than me.  I don’t know I guess I’m open to talk if anyone wants.  Thanks",16

The depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, it all becomes unbearable. Drugs make life feel worth living regardless of all the  negative consequences. It's as though I don't know how to be happy without them. It feels like I've destroyed the natural feel good transmitters in my brain and the only way to feel good is by using.

I want to be clean from drugs but even though there are all these negative outcomes, I selfishly don't want to suffer? Is it selfish though to not want to live in pain? Not all my drug use is destructive to those around me and I've become very apt at hiding it. 

I guess my question is, does it really get easier for everyone who stops? What steps can help me get through it? It's a cliche but I feel like I can't live with drugs or without them. I'm trapped.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",70

2020-07-10 22:20:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hp263c/getting_clean_from_subsopoids/,Getting clean from Subs/Opoids,"So I have used opioids in some form for about a decade. Mine all started when I got knocked out of sports by knee surgery and other injuries. After my surgery, I was in pain everyday for next 6 months. I originally gritted my teeth through it but I eventually folded.

I started with my Vic prescription from after my surgery; it was originally supposed to be for after the operation but they always give a little extra. That was the tipping point; when I took it I could function and I had no pain. I knew the stigma of taking this stuff and didnt want to be labeled an addict so I never told anyone the problems I was having. Moved on to Oxy real quick and pretty much anything else I could get my hands on. That ballooned over the next 2 years; at the worst, I was taking 160mg Oxy a day; I had tried Vic, Percocet, Ketamine, Adderall, Soma, Tramadol, Valium, Flexeril, Gaba (never tried H or Fentanyl thank god). Mixed em in all sorts of ways including alcohol (alcoholic at one point too).

Eventually I got caught by family and tried to get clean. I went Cold Turkey and made it 2 months before I threw in the chips again. When I was off all the pills, I realized how much pain I was in on a daily basis; my knees, my back, and my shoulder were wrecked from playing baseball. I couldn't sit in a chair longer than 20 minutes before I had to lay down and rest my back. My knee ached every step I took; I had trouble moving my left arm above my head. I couldn't sleep for more than 4 hours at a time.

After relapsing, I had a sit down with family and explained that in my current state, ""I will relapse again in my current state or kill myself...I hurt too much to do anything but lay in bed."" I started going to doctors to get relief but that didnt work; I spent a year going thru tests only to get a thoracic outlet diagnosis with a ""nothing we can do"".

After all that, I landed in a chronic pain clinic and was put on a regular percocet prescription. I had trouble with percocet cause I knew I could get high off percocet. After running myself out of my prescription early, I asked to be put on Suboxone. Suboxone can relieve pain but does not give you a ""High"" feeling (it does in the sense that you feel relief but you it's no where the same as any other Opioid). It was perfect for me as someone with pain but wanted to stay away from getting ""High"" or prevent myself from seeking other drugs.

I had been on Suboxone for about 5 years; in that time, I was able to finish my degree, get married, and land a great job. Unfortunately fate intervened when me and my wife started having problems conceiving; we have tried for 2 years.

They say, any medication can affect your chance at conceiving plus long term opoids have been shown to negatively impact Testosterone and potentially sperm count (not for everyone though). With all that and the oppurtunity of working from home with Covid, I decided to give quitting another try to see if it helps our chances.

Fuck it sucks! I really hate this process. I am 5 weeks in and my withdrawals are gone (Subs was easier than Oxy) but I am completely mentally reliant on Opoids. Even with the drive to go thru this for me and my wife, I think about breaking everyday. My pain is not great but kind of manageable with a lot of personal vigilance and effort. I am also doing PT again with better success.

I need advice to handle cravings; working out helps and so does talking. I have times where I am so panicky about trying to get a hold of anykind of drug that I dont know what to do?

Also, I think I am having PAWS but I am not sure. Has anyone had issues with feeling sleepy around the afternoon to the point they want to nap? Sounds weird but I have never been a person who naps but I am almost 30 now; is this PAWs or am I just getting old? What about hypersensitivity?

for some background, I've always had problems with addiction, may it be weed, porn, and right now, beer.





I started a few months ago that I would drink 1-2 beer in the evening occasionally and smoke a few joints (smoke weed almost everyday but that's another topic) because it just felt so chill to walk around in nature, drink sth smoke sth, everything was so relaxed.




I started to smoke and drink at earlier times and also started to get more beer after I finished my 2. A friend once said that I was literally shaking before drinking a beer, like an addict that is about to get his dose.





It has gotten to a point where I drink 2-5 beers each and every evening, just alone yesterday I drank 3,5 litres of beer. Like, what the fuck, on a more or less regular day.





Covid and all that stuff really isolated me even further and I often feel like I just drink to feel more happy, not because I really like it in that moment.





Sometimes I come home from shopping or being outside and the first thing I do when I enter the house is open a beer. Maybe just because it refreshes me, but I feel like I also always want some kind of effect.





Staying sober in the evening frightens the shit out of me, I think I'm still at a point where I can watch my steps with alcohol, but I should definitely be extremely aware.",18

When  covid restriction started in my country, I had to quit since I couldnt  find weed and couldnt get drunk or drinking in my House with my parents.  
Then, in that period, I've restarted my hobbies like music, reading and stuff, but now,  all back like before.   
I  drink/smoke almost everyday/night, and the days I dont go out to party I  wake up, play LoL, lunch, play Lol, dinner, play LoL, sleep, repeat.  
The  only things Im good in my life is school, I mean, I dont really like  it, I go to STEM school (idk how you call that in your country), get  good grades studying high and spent my whole days high.  
I've lots of  friend who smoke/drink, but they have a normal life, have  hobbies/passion, in opposite of me, I'd like to have something to do in  my life instead of wasting every seconds of my life, and I'd like make  something for helping others, but I'd be too shy to do anything anyway.

I just recently found out my boyfriend had been doing cocaine for the last 7 months. Reason how I found out because he stole money from my account, it was $8000. He lied to his parents when I confronted with his family. He told his family that I had a drug deal with him. He is helping me to sell, so my money was his money. He lied!! The thing is I am still with him now. I want to ask as someone who never done anything my life. Please help me understand.

1. He said he lied because he was under cocaine influence and he had no memory or control of his action. Is this true?
2. He said he has only been doing cocaine for 7 month. He was having really bad nosebleed. Is it true that someone who had only been doing cocaine for 7 month could have a bad nosebleed?
3. He opened up to me that he wants help so his family is monitoring him 24/7. Is it normal for someone to be out of cocaine for three days to be super tired? He slept through days and night. Today is the third day clan tho. Last night, he seemed super happy and energized.  Normally he is super dead, did he go back to cocaine again? His nosebleed was better yesterday, but today it got a little worth. Am I just thinking things or he actual went back to it?

I want to help him. But I also want to know if he is really willing to change, if he didn’t touch cocaine last night, I’m willing to wait and see his recovery! Please help me to understand cocaine behaviour!!!

Every 12 step addictions group or program seems to be completely okay with smoking/tobacco. I am struggling to understand this. People can obviously be addicted to cigarettes and tobacco, and nicotine is a mood altering drug and yet it is acceptable by every single addiction group that is offered here. I previously was finding myself feeling a sense of belonging in NA but damn near everyone in NA seems to smoke cigarettes. I don't get it. Like what is it that makes nicotine acceptable? Do people addicted to cigarettes get truly desperate and willing to do anything for a cigarette? I apologize if this offends anyone I am honestly just trying to understand. I smoke flavored tobacco and cigars but have never found myself becoming truly addicted to tobacco. Not in the same way that I have for things like alcohol or weed even. I just really am struggling to understand this because there's no denying people can be addicted to cigarettes and yet it doesn't seem to have the same nature of addiction in the sense that other things do. I guess what I am really trying to understand is how we can seemingly have so many addicts who do not have their lives completely ruined by this addiction they have to nicotine? In the past I found myself swapping addictions or trading one for another depending on what i could get in that situation whether it be alcohol coke weed or sex. Somehow for me personally these things could truly bring me to my knees and I would become desperate for any one of them and would steal or harm anyone to get that which I felt i needed in my addiction. I honestly just do not understand addiction now at all and I feel so confused and unsure of what to think or believe.",7

2020-07-08 11:06:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hnioaf/how_i_think_i_got_better/,How I think I got better,"I struggled with addiction for just about ten years. During most of that time, I had essentially given up on the prospect of ever having something approaching a normal life. I expected to die from my illness, and I almost did, and I have a scar bisecting my chest to remind me of that fact. But, somehow, I did get better. And since I did it, that means other people can. What works for me won’t work for everyone, but in the interest of helping those who I can, I’ve decided to share my thoughts on what I think is helping me. 

How did I do it? 

The honest answer is that I’m not sure. And the other honest answer is that it’s dangerous to call myself “cured” and pretend like it’s all rainbows and butterflies from here on out. I’m sure that bad things will again happen to me, as they happen to everyone. And I’m sure that I’ll make some bad decisions. I’ll probably have days where if a rig magically appeared in my hands, I’d be tying off in the next second. But I’m a year sober and feel like I have the tools I need to stay that way. (I’m sure there are some people reading this who are thinking “just a year? Just you wait.” To which I say - go fuck yourself). 

There are several things that have helped me - mindfulness, first and foremost; therapy and medication to a lesser extent; changing my conception of addiction from moral failing to mental illness; and finally, several conceptual strategies whose main purpose is to increase compassion for yourself and others, and to hopefully increase connection with others - the usefulness of which I rank up there with mindfulness. Goal setting, too, is extremely, extremely important, but maybe a little obvious, so I won’t elaborate on it. 

I’ll start with therapy and medication, because while they can’t help you truly create your life as you want it to be, they can save it. I wouldn’t have been able to do anything else without first stabilizing myself. Therapy can take a lot of forms, but I personally consider CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) and “positive psychology” type therapies the most useful. CBT is a pretty standard, almost universally accepted form of therapy, valued both for both its efficacy and its efficiency. In short, it allows you to identify the areas where your thinking is distorted, and to challenge them. You might worry that since you failed one time, you will fail again and again, or you might not even consciously think this but behave like it’s true. And CBT allows you to assign that type of thought to the “not useful and most likely not true” category, and you can start to move on. Therapies descended from positive psychology mostly focus on unconditional positive regard and on acknowledging the validity, if not necessarily the usefulness, of your feelings. It isn’t really a discrete form of therapy as far as I know, but it is a good foundation. 

—-

Medication, weirdly, is a touchy subject for some recovering addicts. There’s a certain sense, in some circles, that if you are using any type of psychoactive medication to help you stay sober, then you are not truly sober. This is an utter crock of shit, and I feel it is barely worth the time to write about it. But since the idea harms some people, I will. MAT (medication assisted therapy) saved my life. MAT has saved the lives of many other people. In any other circumstance, there is nothing wrong with learning you are ill and taking a medication to help you. All medications can be misused to some extent, and yes, in the hands of an addict there is certainly more potential for misuse. But it doesn’t mean you’re still an addict if you need mood stabilizers, or suboxone, or methadone, or whatever else, as long as it’s used responsibly and in the service of a larger goal. Ideas like this keep people from getting the help they need, in favor of sometimes totally unrealistic abstinence based techniques. It also ignores the fact that addiction isn’t purely a matter of physical dependence. Addiction is a mental cloud that mediates your every interaction with the world; when you aren’t well, most choices an addict makes revolve around how they might impact their ability to use. MAT it is not. 

———-

I grew up thinking addicts, and really most other people with mental illnesses, somehow deserved it in one way or another. They must’ve done *something,* or they must just have had no will, or no character. They weren’t *truly* human to me. But dramatic irony sometimes happens in real life too, and I would end up becoming exactly the sort of person I once hated. And I didn’t realize it at first, because I had internalized a lot of the toxic ideas found in our culture about mental illness and addiction, but I hadn’t really chosen to be that way, and no one truly does. You get there stepwise, slowly. You’re born with certain traits, and you’re raised in a certain environment, and for a certain number of people their traits combine with their environment to form mental illness. All this is to say that it really helps to contextualize any mental illness, but addiction specifically, as an *illness,* and not as a character flaw. This idea is starting to take hold, but not nearly enough. 

————
Finally, mindfulness - to me it has been the most important tool I have, and I believe it will remain important for the rest of my life. 
I am by no means an authority on the subject, but in just under a year of attempting (and mostly succeeding) at integrating mindfulness into my daily life, it has become more beneficial than I would’ve ever thought possible. It’s a very simple, but paradoxically extremely difficult practice to maintain, because of the way the human mind works. In first starting your practice, you’ll find that it almost seems pointless - you try to focus on the breath, or your heartbeat, or the sounds in the room, and you keep finding yourself lost in thought. But this *is* the point. It allows you to watch how your mind normally works while you aren’t paying attention. How thoughts just pop out of nowhere and derail attempts at concentration, or how negative thoughts set off a chain reaction that culminates in your feeling terrible, all without you really knowing what’s going on. And it, finally, after much effort, teaches you that you don’t have to identify with every single thing that goes through your mind. You are not your thoughts. You are a million other things. You’re the sound of waves crashing, or a beautiful piece of music; you’re the sensation of your lover’s hand in yours, a feeling of warmth, or chocolate melting on your tongue; you’re the color blue, or a painting, or the way the light dances through the blinds at the right time of day. It may seem like I’m trying to be poetic, but I’m being literal. All these sensations take place in the same space as your thoughts, so why would you give your thoughts primacy? It is an extremely freeing, expansive way to think. 

Additionally, I have a few conceptual strategies I use. The most important one, I think, is to imagine yourself as a child. I know this might sound a bit silly, but I think it works. It’s easy to feel all sorts of negative things about yourself as you are now - why did you do *that*?, or why didn’t you? Why did you hurt this person and not that one, and why did you hurt yourself? What about all your regrets? But everyone can have compassion for a child, and everyone was once a child. Didn’t you, when you were young, deserve to be happy when you grew up, regardless of the things you might’ve done since then? Didn’t you have dreams that were worth trying for, as “unrealistic” as they might’ve been? Didn’t you deserve a life as free from suffering as possible? I think that when thinking about yourself in this way, it’s almost impossible to entertain the usual recriminations and self-doubt that can normally occur. 

The second strategy is, to put is simply, compassion. Having compassion for others is sometimes hard, especially for certain types of people. But you find that in cultivating compassion for others, in trying to find joy in someone else’s happiness, or in trying to have sympathy for someone else’s pain, you’re doing these things for yourself at the same time. You realize that we’re all, despite our differences, very similar - we all want the same things, even if not everyone has the best ideas about how to get them, and that if you can extend this feeling to others then you can also extend it to yourself. And even in the absence of actual connections with other people, real compassion for others can still foster a larger sense of connectedness. 

The third strategy comes from mindfulness. You learn, when paying close attention to your thoughts, that you aren’t as in control of them as you may feel. They come, and then they go. There’s really no stopping it, excepting the few moments of “pure” mindfulness you may experience after practicing for a few months, at least. Even when you don’t realize you’re thinking, you actually are - almost every experience is filtered through the prism of your current thoughts. And if you aren’t fully in control of your thoughts, in the same way that you can’t control the next sound you hear, or the next sensation you feel, you realize you don’t have to follow them. They’re just another aspect of consciousness. Important, amazing, useful, even miraculous - but not so different from any other feeling or sensation that may cross your mind. You can look at them, acknowledge them, and use them if they’re useful and discard them if they’re not. This is an incredibly valuable thing to realize when dealing with cravings, or negative ideas, or sadness, or anything else, really. I’ve found it’s even useful to apply this logic to positive emotions - yes, this is nice, and I will enjoy it, but I won’t become attached to it, and feel worse when it’s gone. Because once feeling that I was doomed to live out my days in the pit of hell, and then to escape, taught me something - something that I apply to any negative thought or experience in the present moment - that this, too, will pass.",21

The only problem is my drinking. 

Growing up i lived with my mum (my mum and dad broke up when I was 6 months im an only child). my dad was a foreman offshore who was sober at work... but when he came home for a few months he was wasted the entire time. My mum, who grew pot.. my whole early life she was a  dealer and I dealt with her telling me to go outside because her and her friends were smoking, and to not tell anyone what was happening at home, and that I couldn't have birthday parties or most of my friends sleep over. She was and still is a big drinker.

At 16 I was a pretty heavy pot smoker. When I say pot, I'm in aus. So here we smoke it with tobacco. Which is highly addictive.. so imagine hanging for a cigarette mixed with the high of a bong hit. Yeah not fun.

Anyway I ended up going through a drug psychosis..(thanks to a 7 year every day pot habit, mind you I never had to pay for it.. and a 2 month speed habit which I now think back in pretty sure was ice, that I also never had to pay for) and wound up in a mental ward a couple of times. Came out quitting pot (yay go me) and hard drigs altogether.

Anyway drug free for 10 years but now history's repeating itself and here I am with this alcohol habit where I can't go more then a couple of days without a drink. Im writing this as a realisation post and also a post for you all to share your experiences in people qho have addictive personalities and how you're dealing with it.

Sorry if it’s lengthy, I just had to get it out.

I’m 20 years old, had mild, but tolerable depression since 2017-18 and have been prescribed [citalopram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citalopram) by my family doctor for nearly three years now (started at 20mg, 1 year later up to 30mg, and now I’m on 40mg that I split for breakfast and supper per my doctor’s recommendation).

In my first year of college I enrolled in Administration of Affairs, had only abandoned one class on the first semester, but on the second semester the classes were becoming more and more complex and sophisticated, and instead of seeking help and tutors, I retreated into gaming (Red Dead Redemption 2, Arma 3, Rust, Rainbow Six Siege, all of which are extremely competitive and give high rushes of dopamine, this is important for later), which eventually turned into a full blown addiction where I played 10-13 hours daily and only paid attention to my math class.

Out of 6 classes on the second semester, I passed only one, and abandoned the rest of next year’s course entirely. I told my parents it was due to a lack of interest, but the biggest factor was in fact my gaming addiction.

After returning home on April, I applied for a job at my town’s small grocery shop, but was asked to quarantine myself for 2 weeks since I returned from College. During that time, I kept playing on my games compulsively. Wake up, shower, play games, eat dinner, play games, eat supper, play games (sometimes till midnight to 3AM) and went back to bed.

When I finally got the job the tasks were simple, easy and the colleagues were respectful (There were 3-4 people at once). I would start at 1PM and finish at 6PM, a nice, short and fixed schedule. The morning hours left me plenty of time to play on my PC before heading off to work.


I felt a bit of unease on the evening after my first day at work, but on the second day, my brain went into a full meltdown. All of the sudden after my first break I felt extremely depressed, always on the verge of tears, felt empty and sadness like I’ve never felt before. I was constantly masking my emotions, avoiding eye contact, hiding in the bathroom to cool off and putting every effort I had to put on a normal voice.

My dopamine was completely empty.


My mother suggested the combination of my depression and my previous gaming schedule was causing a gaming withdrawal, something I thought was hyperbole and never going to happen.

I brought my PC down in the basement that evening (went cold turkey), and I had not touched it for 20 days, but replaced a lot of that time with my phone (YouTube, games, Reddit etc), which didn’t help making an improvement

The emotions were so intense that I couldn’t bring myself to call my manager, and let my parents make the call. I was extremely embarrassed, but the manager was sympathetic and told me to return to work whenever I felt better. (Manager had children that were going through the exact same thing)

The emotions lasted for a whole week. 
My mother invited me to be with her while visiting her parents (my grandparents, to avoid confusion) that she had planned for weeks before, suggesting it could help regain my composure. I accepted.

We visited them for two weeks, and had a lot of experiences that I enjoyed. Built wooden tools (an axe and a butter knife), went kayaking with my cousins, shot my first bird while hunting and hiking in the mountains. One day however I was on my phone all day while we visited my aunt, and my mother obviously wasn’t happy at all. She began taking weight off her shoulders saying I had been protected too much, I wasn’t helping myself improve and that if I didn’t find a job and go to college that I’d have to get my own apartment, and live on welfare if it ever came to that. That obviously shook the cage. I didn’t want to hear it, but it’s true.

Early June, I quickly got myself a second job, this time working for the Muncipality (Lawn and nature maintenance). The job starts 7am to 4:30pm with Friday finishing at 12pm, weekends off, wiper snapping the ditches, lawn mowing, watering flowers, cleaning the nature trails, all easy and simple tasks that I can do.

As expected, the same emotions returned in the first week of the job, especially when I worked at the cemetery on the first day, but was eased after my first visit to a counsellor on Wednesday. The second week was quiet due to constant raining (garage maintenance was all we did) and endured the emotions.

The real relief came on the third week, almost felt no emotion, frequently visited my paternal grandparents and cousins, it was overall great. I brought back my PC in my room, this time only playing casual games (Skyrim was the only one I played) making a 2 hour limit each day of the week, but relaxed in the weekends.

The fourth week was also a good one. Hours at work were passing fast and celebrated July 1st with my brother and a friend. The weekend was more quiet, but I spent around 7-8 hours on my PC with a 4 hour break at noon and no visits to my grandparents or cousins.

Then came Monday (yesterday as I’m writing this), I felt the anxiety and depression return. I cooled off in the bathroom during my lunch, which helped a bit and was able to finish the rest of the day without much issue. Wrote it off as a Monday blues, visited my grandparents to take my mind off of it.

But today, it went from bad to worse, again. Just an hour and 45 minutes into work, I gave up.


All I felt was sadness, guilt, helpless, pessimistic and fearful about my future (Living on welfare or dead-end jobs, losing my pet and/or family members, living lonely, having an impact on no one’s life, imagining the details of my graveyard tombstone (Me embracing my pet) dying alone and remembered by no one after death). I was already cooling off and shedding tears in the bathroom the minute I walked into the workplace. I told my colleague about how I was starting to feel, and simply told me he’ll bring me back if I couldn’t continue. 


I tried to push a little further, work a bit longer but then I started having suicidal thoughts. I gave up.

They brought me back to the garage to get my stuff, allowed me to take the rest of the day off and told me to take care of myself.

I felt defeated. The sadness I had was almost as worse than my aunts funeral, and I felt guilty and embarrassed about it, being more sad from my depression than the death of a relative I loved so much, especially on Halloween.

I was petting my dog to try to ease the shedding tears, it wasn’t improving one bit. I texted my dad about how I felt and he offered to come home from work and talk to me. I refused, saying I didn’t want to disturb his working schedule. Guilt and embarrassment again.

I later decided to call and visit my parental grandparents for counsel and comfort. My grandmother reassured me that I will always have help, support, and had an incredible impact on those close to me like herself, my parents, maternal grandparents, cousins, my pet and my brother. Most importantly she mentioned the pain and suffering I would leave behind if I took my own life.


I know I have love support from my family, but the pain of depression is blinding me so much.


I am tired of this depression. I am tired of masking my emotions and pain, I am tired of enduring it.


I just recently scheduled three appointments for mental help. A meeting with my family doctor, I’ve reopened my counselling file from my town’s services that was dormant for almost 4 years, and I’ll be having a meeting tomorrow with a renowned counsellor online.

I just took cannabis edibles a few hours ago hoping it would cope, but sadly it doesn’t seem to help, but instead feels worse.

Wish me luck.

Maybe a little backstory first. Last fall I got discharged from military. After some time in hospital and a surgery I went home and started seeing a therapist. Apparently the mentions of my childhood seemed concerning to him cause he started fixating on some of the memories I had. After a few months of talking about it a lot more memories started to resurface. And at this point it turns out that my dad is a pedo. And he molested me when I was a kid. I just can't deal with those thoughts and the memories hence drinking and using. 

I also don't sleep, the nightmares don't let me. I can't force myself to eat. I don't shower cause I can't force myself to undress and look at myself naked. And I don't leave my apartment anymore because I'm too afraid of confronting people. I just basically rot in here and spend all my time getting drunk or high and talking to my cat or some rats that moved in recently. 

Sometimes I feel like the main reason things are so bad in my life is the fact that I'm completely alone. I don't have any friends and my family hates me. I only have a partner, but he's currently on a deployment in Afghanistan. I haven't seen him since February. And I'm not even sure if we're in a relationship, it's more like roommates with benefits kind of thing.

Because of all that I can't even find motivation to get better and stop drinking and using. Cause no one cares whether I'm sober or wasted. Whether I'm alright or a wreck. And I just can't do it. I'm too damaged to keep going, I have no future, I'm unable to have a normal life. No one would want to stick around cause I'm too messed up.

But despite all of that I still have a tiny bit of hope. And I'd really appreciate talking to anyone.",26

I don’t have any faith in anything he tells me. He recently overdosed on heroin, and I performed CPR on him and called 9-1-1. This was probably the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. He wasn’t open and honest with me about it being heroin until I found syringes days later. He was reporting it was bad THC cigarettes despite the paramedics telling me Naloxone revived him. 

In addition to this incident, I’ve lost trust because he’s sent many messages to men/women on Craigslist giving them his phone number and sending his photo saying he wanted to hook up. I don’t have any proof he actually did meet up with anyone, but, the act of seeking them out, I consider cheating. This has happened on 3 or 4 different occasions since May. I know because I’ve looked through his phone a few times, and then immediately addressed it with him. His response is it’s a “joke” and he’s doing it out of “boredom”. 

He has a friend over the past year he met in a Veteran Support Group I never met who seems to always be involved in this drama. Multiple times he’s told me he will stop spending time with him, but, my boyfriend wants to help him, and in his efforts to help this man he’s been pulled into so much stuff that is out of character for him. It’s my understanding that this man gave my boyfriend the heroin as he was withdrawing from Buprenorphine (he says he was prescribed this for depression- and he searched for a doctor who would prescribe it for that reason)

Many times I’ve told my him I want to end our relationship. He refuses to leave my apartment because he says he loves me and wants to make things work and is committed to me. I would literally need to call the cops for him to leave and I don’t know if they would actually make him leave given that he’s lived with me almost 1 year. In response to his comments about him being committed to me, I often respond that his actions show his true feelings and desires. My boyfriend has PTSD and Depression and many times those illnesses are used as the reason for his behaviors. I know with COVID he no longer has therapy (his therapist wasn’t working during COVID and then stopped taking his insurance). 

We’ve discussed couples counseling many times but haven’t actually engaged and at this point I’m not sure if we’re salvageable. I have been with him for 2 years and care for him deeply. I can’t handle all that’s happened but he’s often times open to discussing it and admits to his poor choice/mistakes. He’s not always the most forthcoming, but, if I confront him with facts and information he usually discusses it.

I’m becoming so consumed by anxiety and worry for him and his well being.

To now get your insight- at this time I want to continue to try to be a support to him. I’ve never been with or dated an addict, does anyone have any tips?",5

I've noticed that it's quite hard for me to decide on my own to not use PC or phone throughout the day because I have a strong pull to do it (or maybe its just a habit because I've been doing it for so so many years). Also, I tend to have these urges to eat junk food and sometimes even alcohol. With alcohol, it's a different story because I tend to not drink for a few months and then drink once or twice (and in a way where Im a little bit drunk, but not so much as I used to be).

My goal is to become as healthy, conscious and self controling as possible, but things happen where I come back to these behaviours.

Most of them are straight up unhealthy whereas others are on the edge of being good or bad.

How do I know if I need help, what kind of help do I need and in general- how can I overcome these things?

For example, urges to eat junk food- I can resist the temptation to do it sometimes, but sometimes not and I don't know what it depends on. Sometimes Im in the state to say that I'll not be eating and that's awesome, but sometimes something else in my brain happens and then I just automatically do it.

I call it being impulsive because I don't consciously choose. If id do, I'd almost never if at all choose that kind of behaviour.

What do you think? How do people deal with this? Is it something that can be dealt with? And where can I find information on what's going on within me, what are the root issues and how to deal with them?",1

We experienced addiction ourselves with xanax, oxycodone, heroin, and basically every opiate and benzo. We got sober february 2018 and have stayed sober ever since. 

In November 2018 her brother passed away from a heroin overdose. He struggled with addiction as well, just like us. He was such an amazing person, like genuinely one of the best people I’ve ever met. There’s so many little things that happened that my girlfriend thinks about 24/7.  Her brother was the only sibling she had and they were close. Much closer than I am to my brothers. He lived a hard life, but I never saw him without a smile on his face. 

She has so many unanswered questions. She always wonders if it was on purpose, or if it was an accident. If he was in pain. There’s a lot of things that I could add for it to make complete sense as to why she wonders those things, but it would make this so long. 

I know she’s hurting so bad. I know it’s killing her. I can never find the right words to say, or how to help. I feel like the worst girlfriend. My heart is broken for her, for her brother, her family, for everything and everybody. We’re all hurting so bad, and I’m worried about her and just her mental health in general. She doesn’t talk about it, or any of her feelings much, but when she does, she has a really hard time. 

She just recently started talking to her old therapist again, which makes me super happy because I know she needs to talk about things. I always tell her that I’m here for her no matter what, and that she can talk to me anytime about anything, but she just doesn’t like talking to me about things. I’m just hoping that she knows I’m here, but sometimes I feel like I never say the things she wants to hear. I just want to be here for her, but I always feel like I’m doing everything wrong.",2

2020-07-06 00:24:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hm0wom/loving_an_addict/,Loving an addict,"I wanted to write this because over the last year I’ve found myself typing the same question into google over and over searching for answers to try and convey to my addict partner what life is like for me: What is it really like to love an addict?

Loving an addict is in the same way the most selfless kind of love and the most selfish. Loving an addict is giving yourself entirely (emotionally, physically, mentally) to the addict and the addict’s well being. Loving an addict is being a martyr and a hero when no one really asked you to be. Loving an addict is exhausting, unbearable, painful, traumatic. Loving an addict is spending every waking moment wondering if they’re safe. If they’re using. If they’re lying. If they are where they say they are. If they are doing what they say they’re doing. Loving an addict is constant fear and dread that in the 2 hours you haven’t heard from them they have ODed and are dead. Loving an addict is waiting for the inevitable day you will either find them dead or get a phone call that their body was found if they do not recover. Loving an addict is watching their every move, questioning if their pinpoint pupils is a reaction to the light or if it’s due to opiates. Loving an addict is countless stays in detox and rehab, counting down the days until they will come home to you. Loving an addict is looking over their shoulder to see if the text they just received is from their family member or from their dealer. Loving an addict is counting your own Xanax every day (that you were prescribed so that you could function through the pain of loving an addict) to make sure that they didn’t take one or several when you weren’t looking. Loving an addict is waking up screaming and crying from yet another dream that they overdosed and died. Loving an addict is taking their car keys while they’re sleeping and searching every nook and cranny of their car to find evidence that they’re using. Loving an addict is carrying Narcan in your purse, AND in your car, AND keeping it in easily accessible spots in your home god forbid they use too much and you are the only thing standing between life and death. Loving an addict is taking on another person’s pain and struggle in addition to your own. Loving an addict is dedicating your life to making sure you remain responsible even when you are struggling to keep your head above water, so that when they are in a bind you can take care of the both of you. Loving an addict is lying to the other people in your life when your partner is in rehab and begs you not to tell anyone because he is so ashamed that he relapsed again. Loving an addict is living in shame and secret that the person you love is not everything they seem to be. Loving an addict is your ear to the bathroom door, wondering what’s taking so long. Wondering if you’re going to have to kick the door in because they’ve miscalculated how much they can use. Loving an addict is living in terror that this time, the dope they bought could be laced with fentanyl. Loving an addict is finding pawn receipts under the bed for items you cherished that they sold to buy drugs. Loving an addict is looking at old photos of you together and remembering that that was a time when they were high or a time when they were detoxing. Loving an addict is the abuse that comes when they are writhing in physical and emotional pain from detox and battling with their demon right before your eyes. Loving an addict is being begged not to give up on them when you are struggling to hold onto what is left of the hope that you have that this time will be the last time. Loving an addict is wondering why their love for you isn’t enough to keep them sober. Loving an addict is feeling like every ounce of joy and peace has been stolen from you. Loving an addict is talking them down from being on the brink of suicide because they don’t want to use anymore and can’t stop. Loving an addict is being called into your boss’s office at work, asked why you’ve been so distracted, why you keep asking to leave work early, and the real answer is because you are afraid if you don’t get home soon enough your partner may be dead. Loving an addict is seeing both the person that you love more than anything in the world and also a cruel monster you don’t recognize.",104

I do have one sober friend and I called him earlier cuz he's the person that I call for a little stuff like this and it's what made me think to come here.

Also I wanted to say to anyone out there in the same position is me that it is good to be able to brag about the little things cuz no one else really cares other than the other sober people in your life and possibly family.

2020-07-05 20:16:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/hlxdby/xanax/,Xanax...,"This is going to be me mostly venting, maybe some people can relate, or it can prevent people from even starting or quitting while they are ahead. Anyways I was never actually prescribed it, I could just obtain it. I remember one of my best friends growing up being addicted and popping bars like candy and it turned him into a lunatic, especially once he stopped. Well that dismayed me from wanting anything to do with it for years....but I have dealt with anxiety/depression for a long time, been on SSRI'S, and the fact I could get them relatively cheap I thought I would try. The thing about Xanax Is if you've never tried it and just read stories, you would think the way people talk about it it's like a such a fun and appealing drug. Reading bartard stories just sounded fun. It's actually nothing like that. It's not like Molly, weed, alcohol there's no euphoria...you really don't feel anything on it, which I guess is the purpose as an anxiety medication.

The first pack I got I remember thinking man what an overrated drug. It doesn't really do anything, you don't feel anything. But it does it subtly. I guess things were easier in a sense? I spent more time outside, slightly more productive, time absolutely flies by. You would do innocent stupid things like buy something and sober up and be like why did I buy something so completely random? Lol. Well they ran out after a few weeks which was fine I wasn't intending to be on them longterm. Well the withdrawal it was something that I was definitely not prepared for. Especially after being on them for a relatively short period of time, I guess I was taking a higher dose then I thought and then quitting cold turkey. Now I've quit weed, cigs, alcohol, caffeine, which was nothing compared to this. I remember literally laying in bed for 10 hours the first night not sleeping a minute, just going into rabbit holes of thought mind and heart racing. And I have never had problems sleeping. The insomnia coupled with no appetite on top of not really digesting what you did eat...couple that with the rebound anxiety, your body detoxing and not feeling all there.  While time flies on Xanax, it absolutely drags off it. Like something you did yesterday felt like it was 2 weeks ago. And this goes on for days..sometimes weeks. All while trying to maintain a full time job. 

Well you would think that withdrawl nightmare would make me never touch Xanax again. Not the case. I would go back maybe only buying 20-25 bars every couple of months going through withdrawl again and in a couple months, rinse repeat. I couldn't live sober, but I couldn't on Xans either. The thing about me and Xanax is they are boring by themself. It started with Xanax and a monster/red bull which felt good, then turned into Xanax and a few beers which was even better, then Xanax and 8 beers, then Xanax and full on hard liquor which is when things really spiraled out if control. Now Xanax withdrawl is soul crushing by itself but combine it with  alcohol wtidrawl....ive done it too many times but the amount of times I've had to has literally crushed my spirit. I feel like everytime you go through Xanax withdrawl a part of you dies, it's like it ages you and you become a shell of yourself. 

It has probably cost me 20k+ in the few years, between breaking 3 phones, 3 laptops, the Xanax, alcohol, Ubers, stupid purchases, missed work, fast food etc. I still don't sleep well, my short term memory is terrible. I have blacked out numerous times and fuked up my face on 3 diff occasions which was always fun when it looks like you got into a fight and have to explain to coworkers and make up some story and get asked and looked at weirdly by literally everyone. I've spent nights laying on the bathroom floor. I've let my life turn to shit and I've lost the will and fight that I used to have to fix it. Because once the Xanax and withdrawl wear off your left with the wreckage of your life that you have to fix. I've burned so many bridges, did things so out of character that I have to live with the guilt and shame of, had a seizure. I know some people have wrecked cars, been arrested, etc not really comparing it's more so I've lost pretty much everything, including my sanity. I feel like the damage is done and I just don't have the will or energy to fix it. Like the hole I've dug over the past few years is so deep.

All of these things got me exited to wake up in the morning and go about my daily tasks, - Checking my phone to see if I went viral, or a message form a cute girl, or a cool videogame notification.

It is up to me to get out of my comfort zone and meet some real people, However I would appreciate  advice on how to my addictive tendencies to my own benifit, maybe a game that i can look forward to but after max 1 hour, i get bored but excited for tommorow and doesnt harm my well being

I first thought it was alcohol-specific, and then thought it wasn’t alcohol it was the pills, etc. I’ve come to realize, I simply want excess of anything that feels good — food, drugs, alcohol, sex, nicotine, etc. I’ve somehow never managed to get too far off the rails in life, and I think that’s primarily due to how often I switch my current vice. From what I’ve read so far, this is common behavior in addicts. 

I’ve been through substance abuse programs, gone to AA, seen therapists & psychiatrists, etc. and still am left with this want for more of everything.

The worst part of it for me, is that I don’t really know what I’m trying to solve or fix, or what the end goal I’m trying to get to tangibly looks like or is. I mean, I get being sober is one aspect of it and living balanced in general is another. I guess I’m just confused about it all, I lived for years a normal life that was not impacted by any of this behavior and now since I’ve become aware of the issues, I feel like a completely different person. I can’t connect with people anymore, I keep a lot of distance between myself and others including family and friends. I just don’t feel like me anymore, it’s almost like I’m outside of my body without the ability to be a ‘normal’ human being.

Can anyone relate to this? How did you navigate it? What helped you?

Any direction or feedback is truly appreciated.",3

He had an overdose 3 years ago of a cocktail of about 4 different substances and I walked in on him literal minutes before he would have died. The paramedics were quick though and he survived but so did his drug addiction. He has been put into mental institutions by the police several times after this for aggressive behavior and one year ago it kind of peaked when he was isolating himself in his room for about 2 weeks, curtains shut, listening to ""Metro 2033"" for weeks on end and taking liquid extasy daily for those 2 weeks. He burned out completely, lost all sense of reality and self, was super desoriented, confused. Sent 10 minute voice recordings to his former boss just rambling about the apocalypse. He was then put into psychiatry for 3 months without being able to leave. Recovered (not fully) from his psychosis that he had (He was telling me during the psychosis that Hitler had visited him one night and passed on his personality to him, so now he was Hitler now (- we are germans..)). He is definitely very slow now with his speech and his thought processes don't quite work- it's mostly just very hard for him to verbalize or make sense to others, he is kind of scatterbrained (is that a word?). Our relationship is ok-ish, it has taken me at least 2-3 years to accept and understand that I have no control over any of this and it's not my place or responsibilty either to try and get him clean. He has taken steps after starting to use heroin earlier this year and is now in a methadone programme and is talking to a very good social worker, so I'm ok with how things are going at the moment. He has been on Seroquel and Lorazepam since he left the psychiatry and he's also taking benzos daily.   


However, yesterday we hung out and he said ""I'm gonna do LSD this weekend, can you be my trip sitter?"" and I kind of over reacted and was kind of harsh saying ""no, definitely not, I don't want to have anything to with drugs."" and he then didn't really wanna talk about it much longer. I was absolutely shook he would ask me that after all our family had been through, which I don't think he realises at all, he doesn't really understand his own or other people's emotions at all, plus asking me specifically, although I had prevented his death and seen him almost die 3 years ago!   
He explained that he wants to ""grow mentally"" and find out things about himself, but I know what the place looks like that LSD takes him. He has been there plenty of times before and I am super worried, because I don't think I can handle seeing him destroy his brain like that again. Now, I know there is literally nothing I can do about it all, my only conflict is: He told me he was going to take LSD and I feel like I am obliged to inform our parents about it. I know they would try to intervene though and it will just make things worse. My brother might lose trust in me. But if I don't tell my parents and my brother goes bat shit crazy again on LSD and risks another psychosis, wouldn't my parents be super disappointed to know that I knew about him planning to take LSD? I'm really conflicted, I don't know right from wrong right now. Last night I had 2 dreams of him taking the LSD, in dream number 1 he couldn't handle it, tried to compensate his overwhelmed mind with other drugs, ended up overdosing and died and in dream number 2 he had a psychosis and was only rambling nonsensical stuff (just like a year ago). And the sad reality is that both of those dreams are (if not highly, but still) likely to happen and I feel like a prick just sitting here, not even trying to do anything. I decided to not do anything, but it makes me feel kind of uneasy.  


Plus, after I said I won't trip sit him (I actually considered that for a second afterwards, but hell no!), I asked if he could ask somebody else. I just want him to be safe. But he said no. So it's either me or nobody and that freaks me out.   


He is absolutely not mentally stable (I mean he HAS to take antipsychotics still from a psychosis one year ago) and I am so worried about what will happen to his brain when he takes LSD.

This isn't satire, or a joke post. This is something that I'm worried might be affecting my health. I can't stop sniffing mothballs. For those of you that don't know, Mothballs are a chemical ball pesticide that smell pleasant. I take a box of neat, white handkerchiefs, and put them in a small shoebox folded with a bunch of mothballs, and smell the handkerchiefs for hours on end, whether I'm watching a movie, or writing or doing something on the computer and I'm worried that it might be affecting my health. I keep so many mothballs in my room (Tucked under bookshelves and dressers, or in every nook and cranny). It used to make me light headed when I had them in my smaller room, but I've recently gotten a bigger bedroom so I guess it's not as bad. In the smaller room I'd get small headaches and get lightheaded but I think I've built of a tolerance. I guess I'm wondering.. 

&#x200B;

Will it affect my health? What are the long-term risks? 

How it started..

As a kid, I always lived with my grandparents. I would consistently stay with my great grandparents too. (We called Great Grandma 'Granny'). Well Granny kept her house full of mothballs, so the smell is super nostalgic to me. I lived with strict grandparents (although I was pretty straight-laced as a kid, so I got away with pretty much whatever due to the established trust). But after my grandpa died May 4th last year I spiraled into a deep depression which still sort of lingers brought on by grief. I design my bedroom as 'nostalgically' as possible as a lot of our traditions and such kind of disappeared due to circumstances beyond my control. For instance.. I still watch the Christmas specials we always watched together, I still watch Westerns, Old Hannah Barbara Cartoons, Old Sitcoms from the 50's and 60's just like we used to do. I even moved in a large Amish clock into my room from the living room in secret because of it's nostalgic songs it played often. So the smell of Mothballs is very nostalgic to me, and takes me back to those days.",8

And when I am not online I sit in front of the TV watching cable news or political shows. I don't get to do the things I used to love like reading Science Fiction novels, watching sports, or even just going for long walks. 

My friend suggested I should go cold turkey and delete everything political on my computer, don't go to any more news or political websites, and only watch the news on TV once or twice a week. And instead of reading political books all the time, to read sci-fi.

Long story short I’ve (F27) basically had an addiction since I was 12. 
Started like : 
Cigarettes
Weed
Pain pills
Alcohol - alcoholic from 16-24
Then opiates from 24-26. 

I turned 27 in March and I’ve been clean from opiates and alcohol for 1 year this month on the 14th. 
Since then I have religiously been smoking weed though. Like. Everyday. I also have a prescription too Xanax (that I’ve had since I was 21. Never had an issue with abusing them, as I only use them for their purpose) But..

In April one of my best .. literally BEST friends died suddenly. We still don’t know what happened. They’re thinking a freak medical “accident”. His heart literally just stopped. He was 28. Didn’t do drugs or anything. It has been VERY traumatic for me. And also triggering my cravings for opiates. But I have been using my Xanax instead. But also because I’ve been having panic attacks everyday since he died. 

I’m afraid I’m going too get addicted to my Xanax. I can feel it happening. I’m only happy when I’m on them. I can only enjoy hanging out with friends, sex, food, anything, if I’m on Xanax or stoned out of my mind. 

Whenever I’m sober all I want to do is lay in bed. I don’t feel myself I don’t feel like I have any energy to even be a human. Can I even be a human without substances? I’m starting too feel like I literally will never be truly happy unless I’m under the influence. Does anyone else’s feel this way? Sorry for the long ranted post. Just trying too see if anyone else feels my pain.",44

Is there going to be a time when I stop missing smoking? I feel like I'm going to be with this feeling all my life and I don't want to.

I feel good when I smoke but I don't want to spend money on becoming more and more stupid. Maybe I just want a fucking excuse to fall again, maybe I really think this time is going to be different and I'm going to be able to control it, but what I don't want to happen is being an ex-drug addict forever. Wanting to smoke every damn day in my life. Not only that everyone around me smokes and makes it normal and happy but I just feel like a fucking slave to shit that isn't even worth the money.

In summary, I want to ask just one thing, if I stop smoking, is there going to be a day that I just don't remember that I did smoke? Do not miss it?

Sorry for my english.",1

My grandpa passed away recently, when I was at  my grandparents that day of I saw a bottle of his sleeping pills he was prescribed when he was ill. My instinct without any thought was to take those pills home and take them. I didn’t give it any thought at all - I just did it. When I saw them there I googled them and figured out they were something that would make me sleep and potentially make me feel different, it was like I had to swipe them and no part of me even questioned whether or not it’s a good idea. It’s just what’s going to happen. 

I haven’t drank in years. I’m trying to be totally clean and sober off any drugs, but if a situation emerges in which I can take drugs that I haven’t mentally prepared myself for, like I didn’t know that was going to happen so I haven’t prepared my actions ahead of time, I am powerless. If drugs become available unexpectedly, I take them.",41

It all started in 10th grade with coke, then eventually Xanax the following years. Finally my 20th birthday I found myself doing lines of meth and staying up for no reason.
 
I went clean cold turkey for months then tried heroin and fell in love. Now Im 4 months in and I realize fuck heroin I’m done chasing that dragon but now I have a tiny bag of meth in my drawer and I know I’m going to smoke some as soon as I wake up tomorrow. It’s been a really crazy rollercoaster and I wish I never took that first line of coke.

Fuck everything but weed and REAL XANAX...in moderation",2

so, i am 28 y/o, and this is the longest i’ve been sober from alcohol i’m pretty sure since i turned 21 and could legally drink. been struggling to get free for a few years. at the end of february i went through a major trauma involving a relapse after a month sober, sexual assault, self-harm, and consequently my life completely falling apart and being abandoned by my two best friends/housemates/only support system. 
this was all immediately followed by me being isolated in an empty house for a month and then moving/driving across the country (mi—>or), i arrived march 6th to a new city where i knew no one or nothing about, then the pandemic hits. 

so, it’s been a very difficult time. i’ve been processing and trying to cope with grief, confusion, constant isolation, anxiety & depression i’ve never experienced in my life which has caused me to lose my appetite and ability to sleep well. 

i decided to be sober april 11th, and i have kept to that, however, having legal cannabis around has been both a blessing and a curse. it has been so helpful in getting sober, but at the same time, i am relying on it now daily the same way i was with alcohol. the difference is it isn’t destructive like alcohol, but i do feel like it’s enabling me to be more of a vegetable than i am already becoming under the weight of everything else i am dealing with. 

i think some questions i have are: is this just what getting sober feels like? is it always this painful and hard? thoughts on using cannabis as a bridge to coping with new sobriety? 

i just feel like i’m starting to really lose it and to top it all off the one person i have been texting with seems to have ghosted me. i’ve never been lonelier in my life. i’m trying to figure out if it’s just sobriety or if i can factor in the pandemic plus the stress of dealing with a new trauma + moving across the country solo. maybe i’m looking for validation? i don’t know. 

if you’ve read this far, thank you. i just try to be a bright light in this world, and i have fought many battles in my life and stayed strong, but i now feel the source of my light dimming. any and all advice or questions or thoughts are welcome.",11

EVERYTHING IS A MESS!!! 
I'm a heavy drinker, I've been trying to sober up but my issues just keep getting worse and I feel like I'm getting duh further and further into a pit. 

I've been trying everything to help I can think of and so far nothing has helped all that much aside from swapping alcohol for benzos (Which I would be fine with but it isn't sustainable illegally). I've been in therapy for years, detox, inpatient at a mental ward, psychiatrist, psychologists, AA, doctors. Nothing has reliably helped...

After my trip to the looney bin I got sent out with a diagnosis of depression, anxiety and ADHD and was given concerta 36mg and lexapro 20mg. The concerta works fine but only for 7 hours followed by a huge crash where I'm distracted and angry for like 5 hours, the lexapro has actively made things worse and after a few months of white knukling it, hoping the meds would do what I was told they would do, I'm back to drinking... 

The lexapro makes me tired and strips me of my motivation and the concerta fucks my mood up something shocking. My parents know of the lexapro not working but they seem to think that the concerta has been like a magic pill for me and they can tell when I'm on and off the concerta but they can't...

You know what, never mind all of that, it doesn't matter. What does matter? I am nauseous, anxious and constantly in pain and no one seems to want too listen to me...",1
