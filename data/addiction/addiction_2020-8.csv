   Hi im ...i started working around 7 or 8 with my parents at a silk screen printing shop alot of experience with that but still have issues getting perfectly lined up. Pretty sure all the years of drinking had a bit to do with that. Bit of a drunk i was. Lost a few jobs for drinking. Drunk on the job passed out showing up drunk stealing booze. But ive done better 2 years sober now....got my life together put myself thru a program was able to move in with my family had so bumps in the road but everyone does. My background check. Domestic battery..what happened.....got into a fight with my girlfriend she left and i started drinking she came back fought more drink more...grabbed her arm left a mark and on her neck. Not my proudest moment.  My last jobs..first was food production wasnt bad but wouldnt really move you up they way they should. I moved quick got to my 3rd postion before i got fired. Why oh i stole a bottle of soda. I was broke always broke. Made sure everything was paid for and spend rest. Then around October which getting fired happened in February i started doing meth. Oh yes im still on it but doesnt effect work.  Just finances are effected. Worked as service worker, really liked that. There where to mix ups with name tags the first i dont know could have been either of us that were on that night. 2nd i know it was the other guy cause i handed off the tag to him. Made sure it was name he asked for before i did. I do learn quick can work with a team or alone. Drug use....weed meth and herion. It doesnt effect my work im always on time and ready. Might have a sluggish day every once and awhile but that doesnt last long once i get going. Im pretty leveled out on 2 of the 3 even just 1. I might borrow money once in awhile but thats just to get myself right. Helps me ignore the fact i put work and the drugs before my family but really what is more of a comfort the drugs or family. They both can hurt you then make it better. Both always want your attition. Both cost money all the time. If you lose one it hurts but after time the pain stops. But of course you wouldnt have lost one if you hadn't chosen the other. Then you just have the one you are comfortable but its going to take more and more. But you have no family around to take care of just you and your choice.",1

I feel that in a situation like that you have to understand why they do it and help the distance themselves from it.

Anyway, i am hopelessly addicted to caffeinated soda-usually cola. When i was little (4 or 5) my mom started letting me drink soda ""as a treat"" but by the time i was 7 i was hydrated on soda only.
Additionally, we grew up pretty poor so around the house there was mostly junk food. I never branched out food wise because we just couldnt afford to buy something that would be wasted if i didnt like it. 
Being 24, almost 25, you can imagine what years of soda and junk food has done to my body. I think the longest ive gone without soda was 3 weeks before i fall back into it.
I literally budget just for my soda addiction because i cant get through the week without it. I will literally pay in pennies if im desperate enough.
I feel like im such a bad role model as a teacher to my students. They (4-5 year olds) always comment on my soda- they even were weirded out when i was drinking water.
I feel like no one takes my problem seriously. My doctors just tell me to eat healthy- wow i didnt know i should just go be healthy! Thanks im cured! When i try to open up to my friends about it they think im joking and say theyre addicted to food too.
I just dont know how to get help so looks like im turning to reddit for some sort of direction or support.",1

My question is why does it seem like addicts, especially people actively using, want kids? Its a common theme i see. 

A former friend of mine will surf all the dating apps and his one and only goal is to find a girl that will let him get her pregnant. These women are often vulnerable, codependent, and in active addiction. 

He met someone two months ago, they moved in with his unemployment fraud money and now she's pregnant. He is still smoking daily, doesn't work and doesn't intend to. He took part of his unemployment money and bought a used BMW Convertible which was recently seized by police (not sure why).

Anyways this just seems like a common theme - why do addicts who can barely support themselves want to make a child with another addict?",2

So i'm 25,been in and out therapy since i was 6 years old.

but in the past couple of years i've completely turned my life around,from living in a big city and working in the nightlife and pretty much being a party animal,to going back to my parents,cutting all social ties with toxic people,redoing my highschool education,working on getting my license,and now i'm even a year into university degree 

\[computer science,me. a girl who fell out of highschool. who would have thought?\]

I've done pretty well in my first year,and as you can see,my life is slowly but surely going up from the troubled teen I was.

But if theres one thing that makes me feel so small,so fucking tiny,regardless of how much I worked and how much I sacrficed to get to where I'm at

There's one thing that still holds me back,and that is my addictive personality. 

I've been addicted to weed for close to a decade,but I don't think weed is bad,i think i'm the problem. 

I remember my past therapist around two years ago said ""I'm not worried about your weed depedency,once you reach a point in life where you feel like you have something to lose,you'll WANT to quit""

And I remember looking at her like shes crazy,why would I ever want to quit smoking weed? it's the safest thing for me to be addicted to. my relatives has also been supprotive of my weed addiction,knowing if it wasnt weed - it could have been much worse.

Well,I've reached that point - I have alot to lose. but i'm also terrified. when i'm sober I can't study,I can't focus,I wanna eat more,I wanna sleep. 

sorry for the ramble,I just really felt like sharing. 

It's not like I can tell anyone I know about this,no one understands how destructive weed addiction can be for reckless people like Borderliners.

i know this is kinda unrelated to the sub but i really have no idea where else to post this. no one knows about my addiction. i get really anxious about it that i can‚Äôt own up to it. i think my mother knows i‚Äôm not sure though. i don‚Äôt want to be like this anymore.",1

I've noticed traits of addiction since I was a child and it also happen to run in the family. It started with prescribed benzos and weed when I was 15, then at 18-19 I tried MDMA and that was it, boy did I like it. I continued exploring the world of drugs with alcohol, LSD, magic mushrooms, micro-acid, etc. I hit rock bottom a few months ago when I tried i.v. morphine, it was love at first sting; I felt numb, all my anxiety and the constant discomfort I felt being myself was gone as soon as the needle when in. I was automatically enticed by the colorful pills, it was all I could think about. A few months after that first morphine high, I realised that I was addicted, badly; my relationships with my colleagues at work, with my family, with my friends and with my partner began suffering from it. That's when I decided I needed to get help, I was put on a subtitution program with methadone to stop the withdrawal symptoms. To this day, I relapsed 3 times taking morphine by mouth, each relapse lasted less than 3 days. I'm proud to say that I've been injection free for 4 months as of today; my methadone treatment will end before the end of the year, my work performance keeps getting better and I feel like I have a second chance at life. I know very few people will read my story, but I believe sharing my experience and talking about it is the only way to make it easier and to inspire others who are struggling. I'd be happy to discuss the issue with anybody willing to talk about it.",12

She doesn‚Äôt have a ton of money, so I‚Äôm OK with giving it to her for the kids, but I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs going to use it on drugs instead. She swears she‚Äôs sober right now, but I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs true. 

I say this for a few reasons: 1) She has dealt with mental health and addiction years for decades. 2) She has a long, long history of stealing from family members ‚Äî sometimes outright stealing credit cards or cash and other times stealing identities and opening fraudulent accounts to fuel her habits. And 3) She has this new photo up on social media that looks innocent enough, but has a big pile of what looks like coke or meth on the table:

https://imgur.com/a/gNrV5mg

Now, I‚Äôm not completely sure that‚Äôs drugs on the table behind my niece. It could be a weird glare or something. But it sure looks like coke to me. 

Not sure what to do here. Am I seeing what I want to see? Or am concerned I‚Äôm seeing? Or am I way off base? 

I want to make sure my sister‚Äôs kids have what they need for school, but we haven‚Äôt spoken to each other in a long ass time and this request came out of nowhere. 

The last time we spoke I lost my shit on her for getting in a bad accident while high on meth with her infant in the car. So it seems really odd that she‚Äôd reach out unless she really needed money ‚Äî I just want to make sure the money goes to the kids for food or school stuff and not her drug habit.

I started drinking at 13 and have drank frequently since. Smoking weed and popping pills at 14, and trying any drug that was put in front of me. But it wasnt until I was 23 and tried cocaine for the first time that addiction grabbed a hold of me in a nasty way. I loved cocaine like I loved nothing else in my life. Within a month I was using close to everyday. Two times over the next two years I had ruined my life by spending all my money on cocaine. I would lose apartments for not paying rent for months, lost a job or two. But I would still keep doing it. At the time i was probably spending $100 on cocaine a night. 

My bipolar manic and depressive episodes got so much more severe. After two years, in 2017 I decided to move back to my home town to be happy again. I never vowed to quit cocaine but I thought maybe moving back to a place I didn‚Äôt do coke at would be good for me. Slow my usage. But it didn‚Äôt work at all. Third day back home and I got drunk and did coke with my high school best friend. Three weeks after that we moved in together. I got a really good job, instead of just serving and bartending I was hired as a manager for a hotel restaurant. I had to work quite a few 5am shifts and told myself that would slow down my partying since I couldn‚Äôt party before a 5am shift. But I still was partying and doing coke with my roommate and our friends on the days I didn‚Äôt have to wake up at 5am the next day. A month later I started partying the night before and bringing coke to work with me so no one could tell that I hadn‚Äôt slept. I called out of work after rolling on molly the night before, and got written up for it. I was occasionally popping xans or dros. But more often than not doing coke and getting drunk every night. Then right before Christmas I lost my job for going to work on no sleep or high and not being productive. 

After New Years I had run out of money to party with. This forced me to slow down. But at least twice a week I would still end up getting high if my roommate or a friend provided the blow. In March I finally was able to get a job. It was a very low level serving job and just two to three days a week. So I was only making $300 - $500 a week. But it was usually enough to stretch to party. Quickly went back to partying four to five nights a week. I would go to my day shifts on no sleep, still high, or extremely hungover. 

After only two months I got hired at a bar. My friends who partied with me all the time would come drink, and afterwards I would party with them and my coworkers. Now I was drinking and doing coke everyday. Probably buying 2 grams a night usually. After only a month there I was given the management position to run the whole bar and restaurant. I was making more money than I ever had. I was probably making about $1500 a week, and spending at least 1200 a week on coke and bar tabs. I was doing coke during my shift and getting drunk during my shift. For the rest of the year I was drunk on most nights and doing a gram to two grams of coke a night.

2018 is when it started to really go down hill. Right after New Years I was with one of my friends who I knew did heroin. Usually I would sniff coke and she would sniff heroin when we went out. One night she offered me a bump of hers and I said yes without hesitation. Everytime someone offers me a drug, I almost always end up saying yes. This is my downfall. I was surprised by the feeling. I always thought of heroin as the people you see nodding out everywhere. But it had this weird euphoria where I had energy. We were talking and dancing all night as she gave me bumps throughout the night. Over the next month I probably did heroin four or five times with her. But it was never something I sought out without her. I was still doing large amounts of coke. 

After getting my heart broken I ended up sleeping with a junkie that got hired at my favorite bar to make myself feel better. What was suppose to be a revenge fuck turned into a black hole spiral as I tried not to feel anything. Three days after we met we went on a bender together. The first night we bought an eight all and stayed up all night talking and fucking. We didn‚Äôt sleep and the next day he scored us some hydros and some subs. He gave them to me as we went to the mall all fucked up. He gave me a bump of heroin on the way to drop me off at work. I went to work on no sleep, and took an addy to keep me going. After work I met up with him at my regular bar to wait for him to get out and I got drunk. Afterwards we did more heroin together until 9am the next morning and finally went to sleep. 

After that for the next three months we spend almost everyday together. He lived 30 minutes from his work so most the time he stayed at my house. But after our first weekend together everything turned toxic. Usually once or twice a week he would give me some heroin but he said he didn‚Äôt want me to get addicted. Most the time I just did coke and drank while he did heroin. We screamed at each other all the time. He would call me a slut and whore all the time. Try to convince me to sleep with his dealer so he could get free heroin. He cut off his finger slashing tires for free dope. Then I found out he slept with my best friends sister, so we ended things and he went back to his ex. But I got hired at my regular bar and we had to work together. 

And like my normal cycle as I got hurt, I would spiral into drugs and alcohol. I started hanging out with a guy I met on a party bus and ended up doing coke in an alleyway with. We will call him party bus boy. He became my drug partner because he was always down to party anytime of the day or night. He had no job and rarely ever had any money. He introduced me to someone we will call frat boy. I would pay for all the drugs we did and all our bar tabs. I could tell he was using me but at the time I had a crush on him and I liked to have someone to always party with. At least weekly the three of us would go on three day no sleep cocaine and alcohol benders. We would probably do half an ounce or more in three days. Tbh I don‚Äôt really know how much because we would always keep buying in just grams or eight balls every 6 hours or so.  Party bus boy and I would frequently fight but always make up because we loved doing drugs together. I stopped paying rent on my new apartment because I was always buying coke. In November I fell into a huge depressive episode as I ignored the eviction papers on my door, the growing mess my apartment had become. I needed to escape the wreck of my life, so I asked my ex to get heroin for me. For two weeks he would get heroin for me and I was looking forward to escaping my ruined life. After two weeks, I asked his gf to buy for me and she ended up stealing $90 for me. My ex got fired from my job and that was one of the only people I know to get heroin from. My other friend that first gave it to me now lived 30 minutes away and I rarely heard from her. 

I got evicted and spent a month living with a friend as I introduced her into partying with me. We were getting drunk and Coked our every night. Benders with partybus boy and frat boy instead of saving money for a new apartment. After a month I couldn‚Äôt stay with her anymore and was spending money on motels. I was homeless with only a backpack full of stuff to my name, and still doing coke to escape. On Christmas Day, a huge family fight triggered a complete breakdown for me. My family found me ungrateful for how distant I had become during my drug use. I had gotten $2500 from my family for Christmas because my grandfather had taken several big jobs that year. Then they told me to not come back to the house. So homeless and no place to go, uncontrollably crying, I called me friend who first gave me heroin. I wanted to get high and then I wanted to die. Heroin sounded like the best way to do both. 

I spent three days at her house doing heroin and occasionally smoking crack. My plan was to keep getting higher until I was ready to die. So at the end of day three I could tell I was way higher than I should be. I wasn‚Äôt able to walk. My friend said she was going to bed and told me just to do a quarter of the line that was out because I was too high. I did the whole thing and then immediately blacked out. Apparently she looked at me and I was blue. She narcaned me and I began to have very scary shallow and slow breaths. She gave me cpr for a long time until her boyfriend came back with more narcan. This time I woke up. I had no idea what happened. She told me. All I knew is I felt terrible, so all I did was curl up and sleep. The narcan gave me instant withdrawal symptoms. I spent the next four days sleeping. I barely ate or drank anything. I was so tired all i could do was sleep. 

On New Year‚Äôs Day I decided that I needed to get my life together. I had technically died. And I realized I didn‚Äôt want to die, I just wanted something worth living. I cashed my $2500 check and used to to immediately get a new apartment, and some used furniture. I decided to challenge myself to do a whole month sober. No alcohol and no drugs. Tbh it was the best month I had in years. I stopped hanging out with partybus boy and frat boy. I got my apartment together and cleaned it almost every day feeling so proud of myself. I had projects I gave myself every week. I started baking. I got really close with my family again. I discovered I could still be a fun bartender while sober. I was even able to go to a bar with friend‚Äôs and not drunk but still laugh. 

The night after I completed my goal of a month I got completely plastered, got into a fight in the street, did molly, had an after party at my apartment. And of course the first people I call while I‚Äôm drunk is party bus boy and frat boy. And just like that it‚Äôs just like we were. We are snorting coke until 2pm the next day. Over the next two months I try to control my partying. At first only getting drunk and partying once a week. Then it was twice. But I was still doing pretty good. I could go a week or so without doing coke. 

Then quartitine happened and after a month my life didn‚Äôt start to feel real. I was only working two shifts a week doing the takeout. I was barely making $100 a week. My family was helping me pay bills. Everything was shut down. Life didn‚Äôt feel real anymore and the only thing I had to give my life structure was one eight hour shift at night and one five hour shift during the day. 

Mid April was fratboys bday was the catalyst of a five month insane bender that housed some of the best times of our life and then some of the worst. We were going on three day benders were a weekly or biweekly thing. We would go thru half an ounce to an ounce a night between three of us and some other passing people. Fratboy was getting a lot of money on unemployment and started selling coke and adderal. He was giving me a few addys every week. I would take them to work or clean. I absolutely loved them. I took addys quite a bit before but just the XRs. He had 30 IRS and I fell in love with them. They were pressed and looking back I‚Äôm wondering if there was meth in them because did the incredible high it gave me. My coworker, we will call her Bee, became incredibly close with me and partying with us. She use to only do coke when she drank and only do half a gram maybe a gram. And suddenly she was helping us to half an ounce some nights. Suddenly the boys and bee and I became so incredibly close. They became like a family to me. My friend, let‚Äôs call her trapbaby, started hanging out with us as well. She was only 22 much younger than us. But she had been around drug dealers most her life. She had been a year clean from xans and heroin. She still did coke but when she started hanging with us she was doing coke all the time, lying to her fianc√© who was suppose to get out of prison soon and sleeping with partybus boy. I felt love for them so intense I couldn‚Äôt explain it. Then during this month party bus boy lost his mother and three weeks later lost his father. He started to spiral but there was nothing we could do about it. The coke bender triggered a huge manic episode in me. I would have episodes where I felt on top of the world, then a few hours later I felt so depressed I wanted to die. I felt every emotion so strongly and couldn‚Äôt even explain it. I started self harming again. I would go into huge drunken rages and throw things and scream. I slept with my junkie ex again. And then I started sleeping with fratboy in secret. When everyone went home we would fuck, or we would send party bus boy out to hit a lick or too the store so we could fuck. 

For the next few months we were isolated in my house almost every day bowing down more coke than ever. All day and night for several days. We had our own little world. I let them trap out of my house and I got all the drugs I asked for. I got $8k in back unemployment. I bought some things and I let party bus boy borrow a grant for his dads funeral, telling me he‚Äôs pay me back in october. I did it because I loved him so much as a brother. I bought my first ‚Äòweight‚Äô in coke. I scored an ounce and just looked at it. It was so pretty. The boys joked around and called me trap brat. In a way it fit my life, I felt comfortable. I would sell occasionally when I had extra. Mostly I would set up licks for the boys and in return got really cheap drugs. I started to be around dangerous people and situations but it excited me and made my blood rush. Then things started to fall apart as the world started to slowly reopen. I had a mental breakdown one night that included the boys getting in a huge fight, me throwing a vase and table at someone, self harming, sleeping with my ex and then fighting almost stabbing him. And I knew that my manic episode had peaked. Which meant the big sad was coming. But I just wanted more time, I wanted it to be how it was so I kept chasing the mania with more and more drugs as things fell apart. 

Partybus boy and I started fighting almost every night. Big arguments. He was sleeping less and less, more and more drugs than the rest of us. He was getting meaner and more selfish. Treating his friends like shit. It hurt me so much because I could see him spiraling. I knew he was toxic for me but I couldn‚Äôt leave him alone while spiraling. I would see the drugs and sleep deprivation get to him and he would make up stories in his head and believe them. I would help him sell drugs at my bar but I would see him do stupid things. He would try to start shit with other dealers, thinking he was a king pin. Starting fights with everyone, sometimes with people he knew he shouldn‚Äôt. 

Then two weeks ago is where everything got really bad really fast. The boys started to hang out with a m guy I had known from a few years ago. We will call him  T. He is well known in the city for selling every drug there is, stealing cars, selling guns, and just generally being dangerous. Unknown the first few days to me, he got them to try meth. Within a few days the boys decided to do a big job with them to make big money very fast. They came to my house to plan it and I was given my first hit of meth, that was the night my junkie friend had come to my house to have a place to stays she was actually how I first met T . I liked it quite a bit but I was high on so many things. Coke, a bit of meth, heroin, and Xanax. I didn‚Äôt sleep and spent the whole day doing coke. I went to work and T and his boy and my boys came to the bar at the end of the night. We all came back to my house and I smoked more meth and did coke while they planned. I loved the meth. It was so much better than coke. They left and an hour later they came back in my house with 100 pounds of weed they stole from someone. The next day we kept doing coke while I helped them bag it up. They were in and out the day and night doing business while I crashed and finally slept. I woke up the next day to everything changed. Partybus boy turned on fratboy, making everyone believe he was a snitch so he could cut him out of the deal. All of a sudden he was hanging out with T everyday. And because of my attachment to partybus boy I was there. Because I just couldn‚Äôt let him go while I watched him ruin his life. So I let him take me further down with him. I smoked meth with him all night, and this time it really hit me. It was so amazing. It was heaven. I was so high and o didn‚Äôt think about sleeping or eating. I just wanted to be this high all the time. T gave me quite a bit for free to parachute. I did that and went home in the am. I was so high and felt so amazing. I spent seven hours high af on my phone, feeling like I had all the answers and could see everything. I didn‚Äôt sleep and had to work. I knew I had to maintain at work so I did adderal and coke. But all I could think of was that I wanted meth. So after work I met back up with him and did more meth. Once again not sleeping I went to work and tried to maintain. Adderal and coke, but it wasn‚Äôt enough. I spent the next four days doing meth whenever I could and not sleeping or eating. At times I would find myself in a room with guns and more drugs than you can ever imagine, riding around in stolen cars, hearing conversations that would chill most peoples spines. On day five my friend, trapbaby, was with us. I had done so much meth in the last few days and loved it. She looked at me at one point and said ‚ÄòI see your face when you do it. You can‚Äôt do it anymore. It is going to ruin you fast‚Äô. And i realized she was right. I had only done it for six days of my life and I was staring in the face of a nasty addiction. I was in love with it. I hadn‚Äôt fallen in love with a drug since cocaine. I forgot what it was like to fall in love with a drug. And I fell for it harder and faster than cocaine. I told her she was right and I would stop after this weekend, since it was party bus boys bday. But I knew as I said it, how many times I have seen addict friends of mine say im just gonna do it one more time and then stop, when I run out I‚Äôm done. I knew if I did it again I‚Äôd probably never stop. 

That was two days ago. When I got home in the morning after one last hit of meth, the comedown started. I laid in bed to sleep and every time I drifted off I would feel like I was falling and wake up panicked and yell. I was having panic attacked and felt like I couldnt breathe. I was so cold and many skin was so white. I found myself searching the floor for any shards. Yesterday I got a few hours of sleep in the afternoon as I started to crash. I felt terrrjble. Never had a crash this bad. I ate for the first time in four days. We had to start setting up party bus boys bday and I knew I needed something to get me thru. I took an adderal and we set it up. I had a bad feeling all night. I ended up blackout drunk as everything unraveled around me. I keep thinking of ways to ask T for meth. I realized what a mess I was in. The next day, today,  trapbaby calls me. She is high on xanax and has a bag of heroin. I know I can‚Äôt help her now. Those are her vices. She won‚Äôt listen to me. I want to bad to go back to her and partybus boy and hold their hand and try to save them. But I know now if I do I will drown with them. If I am around them I will do meth again. I have to cut them out of my life. Because if I do meth one more time, it will never let go of me. I can feel it. I am so glad I didn‚Äôt get any last night or do anything weekend like I planned. Because I wouldn‚Äôt stop. 

So now I‚Äôm sitting here, still having affects of my meth comedown. My legs are restless and twitchy and my vision gets blurred sometimes. I feel incredibly depressed and just tired. I know I need to get sober and stay away from anyone who will trigger me to do meth. Even if I love them with all my heart. I need to try to save myself this time.",12

‚ÄúHe was never bullied, and as far as I know there was no trauma prior to the drug use (though there is definitely trauma related to the drug use). He was an anxious kid growing up, a bit socially awkward, didn‚Äôt really feel like he ‚Äúfit in‚Äù anywhere. He was really well behaved (almost unnaturally so?) until he turned 14, then he turned into a different person. Started isolating in his room, not eating well, not bathing, depressed. He started hard drugs at 14 by insufflation, then graduated to IV at 16. ‚Äú
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî



This isn‚Äôt an uncommon story and one I seem to be hearing more and more since I‚Äôve been in recovery, don‚Äôt get me wrong I would see kids on the street in addiction when I worked downtown Toronto quite often... unfortunately at first, we would always just assume they were from broken homes or unloving families. As my career progressed so did my understanding. 

So at 15 this boy is out on the streets, addicted, constantly running away. There was a glimmer of hope when he agreed to go to a public funded 1 year long treatment Center but the wait was 1.5 years. Nowadays, even a couple days is the difference between life and death. The family sold their home to pay the $90,000 cost for a private bed at the same treatment centre, which decreased the wait from 1.5 years to 3 months.  Unfortunately, 3 months was still too long. He got worse and refused the bed when it became available.  This was not an unloving home or dysfunctional family by any means. 

About 2 months ago I heard the great news from his mom. He was now in treatment and for the first time since he was 14 he was now 30 days CLEAN. Everything going great.  She was so happy.  

I checked in with ‚Äúmom‚Äù today, as I have frequently over the last year or so since we first started talking.   I was saddened to hear about his most recent relapse and psychotic episode. At 17, although smart and safe enough to go to a safe injection site, with meth in hand, because dealers don‚Äôt ask for ID, he spent the next 4 days in psychosis.  Another hospital visit... released. 

Why? How did he relapse? 

In these times, CERB potentially equals relapse. Especially to an addict who is not use to handling a large sum of money or even losing the relationships with coworkers or people you get to see and speak with daily. 
I‚Äôve heard this from more than one person recently. Sitting at home, alone, depressed with nothing to do and little human interaction. This is possibly one of the worst things for someone in recovery.   The opposite of addiction is connection... 


Moms words-
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
‚ÄúRemarkably, he is a great kid. He is not oppositional defiant, he is respectful, deferential almost. Doesn‚Äôt like to fight, just hates himself and turns the hurt inward.‚Äù
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-



Despite this, he‚Äôs  not ready to return to treatment again... he can‚Äôt be forced. He has to want it. 

What do you do?  What can you do?

Talk to your children, teach them, listen to them, love them, protect them from the monsters...even their own monsters. Unfortunately, sometimes this isn‚Äôt enough.  Sometimes the scariest monsters are invisible. Some monsters live in our heads. 

August 31st is International Overdose Awareness Day.  I‚Äôll already be tying a purple ribbon for another 17 year old who slipped through the cracks last month and lost his battle. Sadly, many warriors have fallen this year. Let‚Äôs show the ones still battling how to fight and that their is hope. 

Moms words-
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he still injects ketamine, but to be honest, from a harm reduction perspective, at least he‚Äôs not psychotic.‚Äù 
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî



Let these moms words sink in. It‚Äôs tragic that this is what gives her some comfort.   But thankfully harm reduction gives many moms a small peace of mind. 

This mom sent a couple of pictures originally but decided to not have them posted with the story... bravely, still protecting her son... sadly  their are so many faces that could be the face of this story. 
Let‚Äôs pray for this mom, as well as the many others out there who‚Äôs children are struggling. 

Stay strong mom...moms",10

That‚Äôs me in the hospital recovering from a near fatal heart infection. That‚Äôs exactly how bad it can get. Here‚Äôs something I wrote about it. Please don‚Äôt read if you‚Äôre at risk of being triggered etc. 

This is mainly to show people teetering on the edge where they might end up. (Also, don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm doing just fine now, for the most part. Somehow.) 

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 


The main thing I remember is the smell. The smell of hospital, yes, clean and antiseptic and always with an undercurrent of old ramen and piss. But mainly I remember the smell of myself - me: a decaying, bloated body with drainage tubes coming from my chest, a slowly healing scar. Pus and blood and tissue.

They would come to wake me up around 6 or 7, but I was already awake, of course - sleep is a far-away fantasy in the ICU. The first order of business was to move around a little bit - I was mostly immobile, and bed sores were a risk. Sometimes I could do it mostly on my own; usually I would have to rely on someone else to help me sit up. Usually I could only eat a little bit of what was offered, at least at first. One time I convinced a nurse to go get me ice cream on her break because I couldn‚Äôt eat much of anything else; she was really nice. All of the nurses were amazing. 

I‚Äôd sit there for a few hours, various doctors and specialists rotating in and out to either check up on me or examine me, sometimes explicitly treating me as a object with which to teach residents. 

*Look, students, his chest is pounding, his blood pressure is high - he‚Äôs really uncomfortable.*

They wouldn‚Äôt actually talk to me, they‚Äôd be just outside the room, looking on as if I were a specimen. Which, in fact, I was. 

One time, in the morning, I managed to get out of bed and make it into a chair. I was doing good, I thought. I stayed there all day, flipping through channels, but mostly watching a bizarre hospital-only channel that I found strangely comforting. It was just music and images of nature - all day, hours at a time. This is, I would later discover, called the ‚Äúdeath channel‚Äù by hospital staff. 

That night, when it was time to sleep, I found I could no make longer the two step journey from the chair to the bed, or even stand with assistance. Is this normal, I asked them? 

Who can know, they said, everyone is different, some thrive and some don‚Äôt after such a serious surgery, such a debilitating illness. 

I had to be strapped into some hellish mockery of a hammock, and hoisted into bed, while my mom and girlfriend watched. 

At some point, a nurse noticed I was having trouble breathing. My oxygen saturation had dropped to dangerous levels. She had me blow on a little device meant to measure lung capacity. A normal result would‚Äôve been around eight hundred to one thousand; I could barely get it up to one hundred before giving up. Maybe the antibiotics aren‚Äôt working, she wondered aloud. 

She asked me to consent to being intubated again. I would probably have a heart attack and die in the night if this continued, she warned me. How could I argue with this? The only problem was that I was incapable of signing the form that was offered, so I scratched a jagged line on it, which they said would do just fine. I asked them if it would hurt. 

It is really weird, to be vividly conscious and unable to communicate or move. At first I had to learn to communicate with guttural, animal like noises, or I would point and gesture. I think some of them found me amusing. What in the hell does this moron want his phone for? He can‚Äôt even hold it. 

A few of them mentioned that they were surprised I was even coherent - they told me most people become so delirious in the ICU that they aren‚Äôt capable of understanding their surroundings. At the time, I wondered why they were holding back on the good stuff - why wouldn‚Äôt I want to forget about all this? - but I later found out it was a blessing in disguise: full blown delirium in the ICU is highly correlated with far worse outcomes, short term and long term, mental and physical. 

Eventually, I got a pen and a whiteboard. The thing I wrote most often on it was ‚Äúpain.‚Äù They‚Äôd read it, nod knowingly, and crush up several morphine pills, then mix them into a solution and pump the resulting mixture directly into my stomach, through the feeding tube. It felt good, like a cool drink bypassing your lips and landing directly in your gut. 

I would sit there at night, borderline delirious from the propofol, and imagine there was someone sitting next to me, keeping me company. Whenever I turned to look, they‚Äôd disappear. Nurses would come in and out; sometimes they would talk to me, other times they‚Äôd silently mix up the solution and pump it in without saying a word. I wanted to talk to them so bad (though I wouldn‚Äôt have known how to do it, anyway) - to explain to them why I was here, how I had arrived at this point. That I wasn‚Äôt meant to be here, that I had wanted something different. One time, after the tube came out, one of the sweeter nurses even opened the door to such a conversation - she asked me if there was anything, aside from the physical pain, I wanted to talk about. I did. I really, desperately did. But I demurred. How would I know how to unfurl a lifetime‚Äôs worth of suffering for her? How could I? 

She wiped the tears from my cheeks, smiled sadly at me, and left. 

During the day, I had to expel the mucus building up in my lungs. They didn‚Äôt know why I had pneumonia, just that I had it, and that if it didn‚Äôt get any better I would need a tracheotomy. Several times a day a nurse would come in with a suction tube, and he or she would tell me to try to cough while it was in inserted into my throat. This was excruciating, but I did it anyway. I didn‚Äôt want to die, even if I didn‚Äôt quite yet know why I wanted to live. 

I spent many interminable hours trying to reflect on how I had ended up there, unable to move or speak, with titanium bolts in my chest, with little wires - the ones that would attach to a pacemaker, if needed - poking through my ribcage, dangling above the drainage tubes; how I knew this was it - how this was, finally, what had I needed to snap out of it. Usually I succeeded in convincing myself that change was necessary, but I also thought about using, too. Addiction just isn‚Äôt that easy, and even such compelling evidence of its destructive nature - a hole being eaten from my heart - wasn‚Äôt always enough to stop the cravings. 

I would think about being wheeled into the operating room. It felt like being in the bowels of an extremely clean, low ceilinged spaceship. Low light, strange devices, hushed whispers. There were people everywhere, all of them wearing masks. I asked one of them if it was a problem that I had little pieces of metal scattered throughout my body. Shrapnel, he wondered? Had I been a soldier? Of a sort, I mused, but no, I told him - in fact there were little broken needlepoints strewn about, up and down my arms and legs, from the times I had been too sick to administer the injection correctly and had snapped the tip. He told me not to worry, but he also said I probably shouldn‚Äôt get too many MRIS. 

There was a giant timer on the wall of the operating theatre. I looked at it and wondered if it would be used to call my time of death. The bed was very thin, metallic - my arms were splayed out; they rested on two little extensions on either side - it reminded me of a cross. They placed a mask over my face to administer the anesthesia and told me to count from ten to one. One of my last thoughts was a vague hope that the surgery would fail, that something would go wrong and I would simply drift off, never to wake up. 

Another thought, maybe the final one, was this: I hoped that I would get through it, not so I could finally, truly live again, but so I could kill myself with dope instead.",120

My relationship with my addict boyfriend is finally over and has been for almost 50 days. He is a gambling and marijuana addict. He dumped me, saying he didn't love me anymore and has not contacted me since then. I desperately want to move on and felt I was doing well the first month. The thing is that I am now on my own journey, breaking free of my nicotine addiction. I quit smoking about 20 days ago now, and since I quit I have felt so much pain and despair about this break up. I feel terrible about myself and my life. I feel like my ex is doing better than me and will find someone amazing. I feel it has really knocked my self-confidence that he broke up with me and hasn't come running back like all the times before. Maybe I just wasn't good enough for him.  


In reality, he was not a good boyfriend and caused me so many problems. I was constantly anxious that he was lying to me (as he had so many times before) and had gone back to his addictions. He never listened to me or cared about how I felt, and got angry when I tried to tell him. He took money from me, even though he is five years older and was in a full time job whereas I was a student working part time. He hurt me without thinking of the consequences and came back each time because he knew he had a hold on me. I know he did the right thing to finish with me, but I feel so rejected. I know it's awful to say but when we were together I felt he needed to be looked after and that I had more going for me; now I feel like an utter loser and am questioning everything about myself. I feel completely unlovable. I don't know what I could have done to make him stop loving me.  


I just need a little perspective. I feel like I'm in a dark hole and am struggling to get out. I really loved him; it didn't matter how many times he hurt me because I knew he was struggling and I wanted to be there for him through everything. I feel so lost and so hurt. Any advice or words of support would be appreciated as I feel very alone at the moment. Thank you. 

TL;DR got dumped by my addict boyfriend and feel awful about myself",4

I could t stand the hangovers and realized it‚Äôs more than I have ever drank so I tapered off the tequila, which sucked but I did it, and now just have some wine or beer to smooth out the coke.

I‚Äôve been struggling with pornography and with it for 6 years and Ive been using it as an escape from all the bad things and hardships in life. My sister has a disability, she has Aspergers and ever since I‚Äôve know her I‚Äôve had to be more of a parent to her because my dad has it to. My mom and dad were divorced when I was little and my dad struggling to find a house lived with his parents at the age of 50. So at the time it was new and fun and it was an escape. There is not a day I regret that decision and I still do deal with these problems. Right now I‚Äôve done a ton to help myself and be better at this addiction. I‚Äôve blocked my phone from porn on the internet browser with screen time, I‚Äôve used register editor to manually block myself from using incognito mode on google and using guest mode and history, and have been very willing to change. Still some how on this website I still find that I can watch it on here. Now I know what your thinking, How could you do that if you had screen time locked and don‚Äôt you manually have to set a code? Yes I did have to set a code but before I realized I could do it on reddit I blocked porn on my phone and made my friend type in a code to my phone and he has completely forgotten it at this point in time. So with that I cannot change reddit because all NSFW stuff is unblocked and I can still view it. Here I am and my porn addiction is still happening but I want the world to know and especially everyone on this website what it did to me. I‚Äôve cried and broken a knuckle and smashed things to bits over this and I‚Äôm completely over it. Life to me should be about happiness and the pursuit for it and I‚Äôm going to successful. Anyone can make it and even come out of there own addictions and problems if they do what they need to do to pursue that happiness. I am going to spread my message very far and tell everyone that I am a porn addict and ready for a new step with my words and actions.

I had no idea of any drug use* 
For several years I (32f) thought my mother (58f) was severely depressed with early onset dementia (possibly the dementia part because she just had a shit memory). She‚Äôs a hoarder and has a shot memory. Made sense in my head, and my siblings confirmed that was a possibility. 

Well one day we got bed bugs, and I had to sanitize the entire house. I went through ever room, piece by piece. When I got to hers she said she‚Äôd take care of it. 2 days later it was obvious she didn‚Äôt, so I did. 

I found a box that was hidden that contained meth pipes along with bags that had residue... Beyond pissed would be an easy way to explain my feelings. I contacted my siblings... My brother was no help, my SIL said as long as she wasn‚Äôt using around the kids it was fine, and my GF(f40) at the time was supportive of both... (wtf...). My sisters response was that she needed to be among the trees......... Yes. Very hippy. 

I did confront her. She blamed it on watching my kids. They‚Äôre not the best, but they‚Äôre definitely not ‚ÄúI have to do meth to watch them‚Äù type. She promised to quit and I did drug test her weekly. She was clean 6 weeks before I stopped. Minus marijuana. Also legal here, and the best way to detox if you can. Plus, I‚Äôm a responsible toker myself. 

Now, currently. House is clean. I do regular checks but she‚Äôs back to her hoarding ways. Her mental capacity has diminished rapidly. I feel like she‚Äôs using again. 

Like wtf. I‚Äôm at a loss. I pay all the bills plus her phone bill, and I‚Äôm home by 1pm at the latest from work. It‚Äôs a maximum of watching a kid 5 hours per day. (My 4 yo is technically only watched twice a week, thurs and fri). I‚Äôm in California if that makes a difference. 

Would living for free plus your phone bill being taken care of be too little? My kids don‚Äôt wake up until 8, so it‚Äôs 5 hours a day. That‚Äôs if my 4 year old wakes up early, which she rarely does, but she‚Äôs here from wed-sun and I‚Äôm home over the weekend. She‚Äôs making it sound like these hours are impossible. 

I feel like I have a duty to help my mom. But she‚Äôs made it apparent that I can‚Äôt afford to get daycare. Which, I can‚Äôt with her living here but I might be able to find a morning nanny that has an afternoon job. 

Idk. I laid it all out. What do you think? To add-We currently share a car because my shitty abusive ex sold my car for $200 and a mattress (I wish I was lying), and I paid for the upkeep on her car to have at least one reliable car... so I do rely on her car and I don‚Äôt make enough to buy a car right now 

I‚Äôm also a hot mess right now. I‚Äôd love to kick her out. I‚Äôm uncomfortable. But not having a car totally screws me. I have a good job but it‚Äôs a 45mi commute. I plan on getting one soon. But I can‚Äôt right now.",2

the part of my mind that I dont like comes out ;
the part that feeds off the one meal I ate today .
the part of my mind that's fueled by my constant paranoia & guilt. 

the part of my mind that I dont like brings the shadow figures ,
and amplifies every sound in a quiet room . 

the part of my mind that has too many thoughts , 
way too many to even begin to focus on a single one , let alone feel any type of emotion . 

the part of my mind that makes me unable to sit still; 
unable to take a full breath into my lungs .

I have a lot of things going on in my life right now, as well as some mental issues but i digress. I have been batteling heavy drug addiction for a long time now, and I really mean heavy in like you name whatever drug and I did it way to much. This spring was really a huge turning point for me, because my best friend who was allways getting ""best shit"" and had it stored for the both of us (50/50) got busted by the cops and had everything taken after we picked up a big order. Long story short Im flat broke and this forced me to stay sober and I did for 2 1/2 moths. But since I have all the same contacts as my friend had I called my plug and got smacked again, not in the extend that I did before but every couple days till today. This constant relapse has now been going on for about 2 months now and eversince I cant stay sober for more than 4 days in a row. The 2 1/2 moths of beeing sober really opened my eyes but I dont know what to do, im just not strong enough. It really feels like I should just quit trying. I mean I already fucked up all my relationships, my edjucation, lost my only stable job and am getting thrown out of my place at the end of january. Right now im just looking at being homeless with no future. Funny thing is I am shure that I would manage all of that if only I got my shit together and stayed sober, but I just cant seem to do it and im running out of time.

&#x200B;

Right now I just feel hopless and alone. Honestly I¬¥ve also been thinking about just ending it all a lot recenly. I mean im living a worthless and depressing life and I really have nothing left that holds me here anymore. But maybe thats just my mind fucking with me and im just missing critical points. Since im trying to keep it short, if any of you guys have any input or questions please let me know.

I'm trying to find help for my mom(50s). She's a recovering meth addict(been sober for a few months, I think), living in Texas. She's dealing with some really intense undiagnosed health issues. No one in the ER will take her seriously because she's a known addict. 
She lost her job due to COVID and has been working under the table, but has recently been so sick she says she can't leave her bedroom. 
I live in Colorado with my 1 year old daughter. I cant bring her out here with me, because when we live together, we are just toxic for each other. And she's burned bridges with every single other family member. I'm not sure what she can do to get help. She can't afford rent, she can't find a job, and she's severely depressed. It seems like she's just going to be stuck in this cycle forever.

Everything i touch turns to shit, and everyone can see straight through me.
Spiraling into submission-
I wish today i didn't exist.
And i wish last night never happened..
Turn my back to the music yet again, because it surely is easier to live life with my eyes closed. 
Numb your thoughts babe because-
Ignorance is bliss and routine is overrated.
Thoughts pile, fester, then get retracted back from where they surfaced. Further to be swallowed, further to swell.
In the end i let them all down, contradicting my actions becoming a burden for each and every shoulder i cry onto.
Creating a false reality to shelter me from pain
I create my own obstacles, then trip along the way
I jump to conclusions all while breaking myself down into micro pieces
I've disconnected from my former self i feel shunned from society

Just sort of ready for clarity.
For peace of mind
Normal thought processes
Healthy coping mechanisms 
An escape
From what I've come to know as my life.
Im clawing at the walls, gasping for air, stretching for clarity
They make it look so effortless, with grace
While time sneaks away from me, i start the cycle once again.
The right path for what i need, for myself to function 
It's a long fucking road to picking up my pieces, once again
And every fiber of my being hopes i give up
Because all ive known is utter defeat, all while keeping a smile on my face
Pushing down my guilts and failures
Glossing over my problems for temporary fixes..
All the while I've become what i fear

My brother is an almost 30 year old Asian male.  He is currently unemployed and has struggled to find stable employment since graduating college with his graphic design degree in 2014/5.  He is in 15k+ credit card debt and constantly just struggling financially.  

He has always been a pothead and smoked a ton of weed all the time.  He‚Äôs gotten into fights with my mom (immigrant mom who thinks weed is evil), he‚Äôs high driving, he‚Äôs been high at jobs.  

He just got out of a 2 year relationship with a woman who contacted me yesterday to share that she‚Äôs really worried about his addiction to K.  I was floored.  I knew he‚Äôd been using recreational drugs occasionally/often but I didn‚Äôt know the extent.  She says he‚Äôs been using daily, all day, in large quantities.  He may acknowledge that he has a problem but thinks he has it under control.  She said the majority of the fights they would have were bc of his K usage.  

He presents as arrogant and stubborn.  He denies and minimizes his drug use.  He‚Äôs now a dealer and makes money and gets K this way. He‚Äôs isolating and lonely.  He‚Äôs developed a persistent UTI that his ex seems to think is bc of the K.  I know he has to be depressed in some capacity.  Our family is fairly dysfunctional - marital problems, alcohol abuse, etc.  

We don‚Äôt have a close relationship.  I‚Äôve always tried to be a support but have been frustrated with what seemed like a lack of motivation or drive and now I found out he‚Äôs been a drug abuser for years... I‚Äôm so terrified and don‚Äôt know what to do.  Ex says I can‚Äôt bring up that I know about the K or that I‚Äôm concerned about it bc she thinks he will shut her out - the only person he trusts.

Any advice anyone can provide?  Experience with K addicted loved ones?  What can I do or say to help him?  Please I just need info.  I just keep googling things and that is not helping.",49

Its not as bad as lot of situations on here I'm sure, and to all those suffering, I just want you to know that whilst I may not know you, I care for your struggle and really hope you find the strength and are given help on your journey.

Its a lazy lifestyle, I don't exercise, and I use escapism all the time for quick shots of dopamine whilst avoiding the much bigger responsibilities in my life. It means things like: I won't respond to family or friends in messages or calls (I think I've developed a bit of anxiety towards actually receiving either), I will put off anything that needs doing, I don't have an organised schedule for life at all and I frequently miss appointments and am late for things.

Since my life has been like this I'm also not very intelligent, I got my GSCE's but I don't keep up to date with current affairs and I sometimes do quizzes with my friends and I'm always very low scoring - doesn't sound bad, but it's made me realise that all I've absorbed over the years is pointless knowledge about video games and childish shit that doesn't matter at all.


But I have dreams, and it's not all bad.
I recently started with a personal trainer and even though I miss sessions and don't do half of what he tells me outside our sessions, we keep going. I've moved across the country (UK) to finally study a course I've been dreaming of for 5 years and I am slowly cooking more often.
However, I am in deep worry that if I don't stay focused (which for the last 2 months I haven't been) then I will loose it all, which is true and it's happened before.
I won't blame what happening with the world right now and I'm not going to keep on talking about the past either, but I'm losing hope, this post is a sign of me doing something which is a step but I just hope I can keep taking them somewhere better.


Thank you for your time and understanding with my life,
I know these are very hard times for us all, but it's communities such as this which give me hope,

From everything I have to give,
Thank you.",3

Someone told me to come here for more support, so here I am, hopefully looking for some support.

I am addicted to Internet Porn.

It started two years ago in my last year of college. Without going too much into details, I found myself in a very difficult place socially and emotionally. As a result, I increasingly turned to pornography as a source of quick comfort and pleasure. I was spending entire days masturbating instead of studying, and as a result, my grades plummeted and I became a manipulative asshole.

Even though my grades were bad in my last semester, I had been an all A student for the rest of my college career and I had high hopes for medical school. However, it didn't work out, and I took an entry level position unrelated to my major in the corporate world in order to pay the bills.

All through this I continued with my porn habit, and in retrospect I don't know how, but I thought it wasn't an issue and that I had it under control. I didn't. I continued to spiral downwards. When I first got my job I stayed off porn for a while, but I quickly fell back into my old ways and with COVID, I'm always at home so it got worse.

I realized that I might have a problem at the beginning of June, when I started watching porn in another tab on client calls, and indulged in them so often that I was not completing my work. I tried cutting back, I really did. But I keep on failing.

My longest streak was 28 days, but then I would fall back and waste the whole day away.

Just yesterday, my boss told me on our weekly meeting that I had been passed over for a promotion because of severe decreases in my productivity, and that HR is aware of this so if I do this again I would be fired. During the meeting I apologized and promised that I would do better, but today I fell back into porn and forgot to attend a meeting that I was supposed to.

And now I'm sitting in front of my computer, wanting a good cry but somehow my tears won't come out. I just feel emotionally numb. It feels like a never ending battle with myself, and I keep on telling myself that I can do it, but that resolve fades everyday, and with the repeated disappointments I just don't care anymore and want everything to end already.

But on the other hand I keep on asking myself how did I become this? I was the valedictorian of my high school, and I always thought I would have an illustrious career no matter which path I took, how did I become some porn druggie who can't keep an entry level job? How did I come to this state? I thought I was better than this, but I'm so tired, so tired of trying to quit the cycle and failing.

I'm sorry is none of this makes sense, this turned out to be much harder to write than I thought it would be. But it's time for me to admit it. And I'm posting on the internet because I am so lonely, I just want to talk to a sympathetic person, even if it's someone on the internet.

I just want to tell someone that I'm trying, I really am trying to be better. I don't know how I became this, I didn't choose this life, and I'm just in so much despair because it seems like no matter how many self-help books I buy, how hard I try, I'm just not getting out.

TLDR: I'm a fuckup who almost lost my job because I can't keep my attention off of porn.",29

I go down then I go up high just so I can crash even lower so I can go higher than the last time. I hate it but I can't stop. I really want to stop. I have no control over my life. I want to be healthy and happy for a change. It's seems so far away that I can't see the path I need to take to get there. I keep lying to myself and others about what I'm doing and why. I'm just addicted and depressed. I'm alone and I don't even have the courage to ask for help again. I don't think I even remember what it feels like to be a productive person anymore. I can manage for a few days just staying home locked up. Then the urge hits and I will go around the world and back to get my fix. I fear for my health. Lately my heart feels like it's on the line of stopping. I want to sleep now but I can't. I want to stop my mind from attacking me but it doesn't.

Hey everyone. I just want to share my story here to see if there are people who have gone through the same situation, or in the best case some good advice.

In this story I‚Äôm not going to use the person‚Äôs real name. 

Starting all the way from the beginning, back in February I met Olivia. while we were both in a foreign city for our degree. We immediately had a good connection and vibe between us. Unfortunately after some weeks, she had to go back to her home country because of COVID-19. While Olivia was back home, she started experimenting with Xanax together with her friends. In the months that followed, we kept having contact on a daily basis. Sometimes though she would send me pictures over snapchat of what she was doing, and I saw some pills laying around. She started telling me about it sometimes and I could already see that she was developing a problem. Olivia came back to our Erasmus city in the beginning of June. When I saw her again and she told me everything, I was shook. It was hard to realize how addicted she was and it took a while for me to process that. Sometimes there were days that she took up to 8mg of Xanax, combined with alcohol which can be a deadly combination. My concerns started skyrocketing but we also started seeing each other daily again, and I started catching feelings for her. Throughout the past months we had been each other‚Äôs closest person, but for me that started to change in actual feelings. At first we didn‚Äôt want to do anything sexual with each other because we didn‚Äôt want to risk giving up our friendship, but we got so close that we both wanted to try, which we did. And it felt amazing. For the rest of June we spent our time together in our Erasmus city, and I started looking for ways on how I could help her. I even contacted the drug line back in my country to figure out how I was able to help my girl out. We both left to go back to our home counties in the beginning of July. Shortly after, Olivia decided she needed to go to rehab to get rid of her problem. Before that, she wanted me to visit her in her student city where she lives because she needed me and of course I went to see her, and we had 3 amazing days together. When we spent time together, she never took a lot of Xanax because she didn‚Äôt want that with me around and she wanted to spend our time together the best as possible. After I visited her, she went to rehab in her home city for 3 and a half weeks. She completely built off her benzo‚Äôs. It was one of the hard periods in my life mentally, but I was always able to support her in the best way possible when she needed me, for which she thanked me millions of times. We had already planned on meeting up when she got out of rehab, which would be 4 days after she got out of there. The day Olivia got out of rehab in her home city though, everything changed. She went back to her student city, and already relapsed the first day she was back. We knew going to rehab would be hard, but coming back in the sober, real life was very overwhelming for her. Since then, she started acting very different towards me. She ended up not coming to visit me either. We talked less and less, and I tried understanding that she needed time and space for herself as everything was so overwhelming for her, so I did my best not bothering her too much. Now, two and a half weeks later, it‚Äôs been a week ago since we last spoke. In the last phone call we had last week, she told me that we can‚Äôt have a relationship at the moment because she‚Äôs not fine with herself and she doesn‚Äôt even love herself at the moment, which I fully understand and I‚Äôm thankful for her not giving me false hopes. That being said however, there‚Äôs been multiple different scenario‚Äôs going through my head from her being with an other guy to her simply not being interested in me anymore, however I think I know her well enough to know that she would‚Äôve been honest to herself. One of the hardest parts also is that I‚Äôm starting to doubt myself, however I‚Äôve always done my absolute best for her. Her future is not looking very bright at the moment though, because she will probably end up having to go to rehab again, and this time for long term.

The thing is, I really really really don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to call her myself to keep checking on her all the time because she literally told me she doesn‚Äôt care about anything or anyone on this planet right now and I kind of want to wait to see if she'll start missing me. 

It kills me that barely 3 weeks ago we were so close, and from one day on another the girl I love just disappeared.",6

I guess I should put a trigger warning too if reading about weed is one of your triggers.

&#x200B;

Basically, I need some outside perspective on whether my smoking habits are healthy or not, from someone who doesn't stigmatize marijuana. I have got mixed signals from people in my life, but most of the negative signals have been coming from people who just inherently hate weed.

I have never really been able to relax for as long as i can remember, which I'm guessing has something to do with me possibly being on the spectrum. I don't really find drinking that fun as I don't like the feeling of losing control, but I'll have a few beers here and there for the taste. When I do go to parties or hang with friends in a ""drinking"" situation I'll often smoke instead while having one or two beers, often with friends who also smoke.

I smoke pretty frequently, I'd say maybe 2-3 times a week at most. I never smoke if I have something productive to do later that day or if I'm meeting family or friends who don't smoke. For me, smoking is kind of a reward I give myself once I have finished doing all my schoolwork for the day, finished cleaning up in the apartment, and doing all the things that need to be done during a day. 

I am also 19 years old and just started studying in a pretty stressful field (engineering). I am really stressed most of the day about my schoolwork and the change of scenery, which gives me headaches almost every day. A day for me is usually waking up, doing schoolwork, taking a break to eat/watch something with my gf for a while, then doing more schoolwork and my brain kind of ""refusing"" to take in more info around 8pm. This is where I'll do housework and then smoke (if it's a day im planning to smoke). This gives me a few hours at night of complete peace and being able to finally relax and not think about all the stressing stuff while watching something on TV. 

I'm just really wondering if I have a problem or not, because I don't think I do, but I have had friends in the past tell me I smoke too much (this was also during a time where I smoked way more, during high-school where I had nothing to do and was kinda sad, but I feel like it's not affecting me negatively anymore.) If smoking got in the way of or affected important parts of my life, I would of course give it up in a heartbeat. Smoking is a luxury I have to ""earn"" by doing productive things in my mind. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this, but I guess I just want some opinions from other people who are impartial/who don't hate weed. I do not feel like I'm addicted, but then again, no addict does, and this is also stressing me out on top of school. I really just like smoking during the night, kind of like some people like to have a few beers at night, and I really hope this isn't something I have to give up. 

Also, my gf doesn't hate the fact that i smoke, but she doesn't like it either. She doesn't have a problem with smoking itself, she just thinks I'm a lil annoying when I'm stoned.

Thank you for reading all the way through, for giving me the time and thank you a lot if you do reply :D (again tell me if this is the wrong subreddit.)",1

I‚Äôve been trying to kick and get clean for the past couple weeks now. I figured it be easy since I havnt been back on dope that long. But that turned out to not be true. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt as bad as that first time I kicked cold turkey those few years back, when i was coming off of years and years of shooting up speedballs and shit. But it was still pretty awful. If you don‚Äôt know what kicking feels like, imagine a sensation like drowning‚Ä¶ because after a while you‚Äôre body gets so used to having dope in it, it needs it, like air. When you take it away, that sickness hits you like you‚Äôre underwater. You start thrashing around in a panic, and you‚Äôd do anything to just take one more gulp of air and be rid of that god awful feeling. But the drowning sensation doesn‚Äôt last just a minute or two, it lasts days, and every second is agony. Try holding your breath now. How long would it take you until you‚Äôd give in and go score? Would you pawn your parents tv If it meant you could have another breath? Would you rob a house? More importantly, what wouldn‚Äôt you do to take in just one more breath?? This is how it is day after day. And yeah maybe this last time kicking wasn‚Äôt as bad as before, but there‚Äôs no such thing as a little bit of drowning. When you‚Äôre in, you‚Äôre all in.

Also I‚Äôm going to be a father, ‚Äúwhether I like it or not.‚Äù Charlie Brown got a hold of me and let me know that the baby is mine and that she‚Äôs keeping it this time. It sent me in a spin and I resorted to my old ways. Running, hiding, getting deeper into dope and booze. My aunt and uncle got the news from Charlie Brown too and they decided to confront me one morning when I came to crash at my old spot. I hadn‚Äôt been back there in a while and I could sense their concern, especially considering the state I was in when they found me.

The room was still a mess and I gathered they hadn‚Äôt been in there since that small fire incident a few chapters back‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt sure if I slept in the old piss or if i had in fact pissed myself earlier in the night, but either way I was soaked from my jeans all the way to my tshirt and even a little on my beard (the smell lingered there for days). My aunt and uncle were standing over me and talking back and forth to each other about the condition of the room and myself, and how it was clear that I needed help beyond what they could give. I unglued myself from the sticky piss floor and tried to have an earnest conversation about my life and my choices and my future with them.

My aunt and uncle are very religious and devout members of this big name mega church here in town. So after a lot of talking and me coming clean and all of us breaking down into tears and shit I decided to let them help me. They don‚Äôt believe in rehabs and I told them I couldn‚Äôt kick cold turkey again so they offered me they‚Äôre best solution, which was to go to get ‚ÄúDeliverance.‚Äù At this point I was willing to try anything, I didn‚Äôt want to be an embarrassing fuckup and put everyone through all this shit again so I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot. If not for me than for my unborn child at least.

I talked my aunt into taking me to get a final fix of ‚Äúmethadone‚Äù from my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù before we went off. I was already sick in the afternoon, so much so that i shot up some tobacco just to feel something until I could fix. I also found an empty vitamin pill bottle in my cabinet and put in a small amount of water and a dash of Big Red soda in it to give it a pinkish color. I made her drop me on a corner and told her to wait for me in the HEB parking lot down the way and that I‚Äôd be back in 10-20 mins. I bought three grams of dope off Monster and pocketed the 25 bucks left over from the 100 my aunt gave me. He throws me two new rigs but it still takes me 30 mins to finally hit a vein and get right. Back in the car I pulled out the vitamin bottle and showed my aunt the ‚Äúmethadone‚Äù I bought. She was skeptical but clueless. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you get for 100?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah he didn‚Äôt want to give it away and he‚Äôs the only one I know that has it.‚Äù I hold the bottle to her nose so she can smell the weird vitamin-y smell. ‚ÄúWhat do you think I fabricated a pink liquid??‚Äù I said incredulously and drank it down. She Purells her hands nervously and puts her mask back on to drive.

Part 2

The Deliverance takes place at like this private hill country acreage that the church owns way outside the city limits. It‚Äôs got a large chapel/mess hall type building and then like large cabins filled with bunk beds like a summer camp, one for guys and one for girls. Basically it‚Äôs a Christian cure-all center. Gay conversion therapy, treatment for paranoid schizophrenics and victims of traumatic abuse, drug addiction etc. So basically I was in for a weekend of ‚ÄúChristian Camp‚Äù out in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of dead eyed oddballs all looking to have their demons removed from them and be set free from their sin‚Ä¶ Deliverance. Thank god I had 3 grams of heroin and a carton of cigarettes on me.

All in all there were about 50 people there. They broke us into smaller groups divided by age and gender. Richie and Kennan were my group mates, and Lee B. was our group pastor. I could sense there was something wrong with these guys. They shared the same black hole stare that everyone seemed to have at that place. After some getting to know each other exercises I began to get a better feeling of where I was. Richie was a gang banger dude a little younger than me, he was hooked on dope and had been on it since he was a kid. His family was tied to a lot of gang shit and he recounted some of the fucked up shit he had been exposed to growing up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here because my family is fucked up and they do beastialities and witchcraft and shit, i see witches in my room at night and when i got locked down in seg.‚Äù This all goes over Lee B.‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúWell have you tried praying the blood of Jesus over you Richie?‚Äù

The other dude Kennan is burly and effeminate. He calls me hon and keeps making little innuendos ‚ÄúI love your buns, oops I meant man bun!‚Äù I think I know why he‚Äôs here. I share some of my story and tell them mainly that I‚Äôm here to try and become a better man for the kid I‚Äôm going to have.

Most of the activities involve delving into your past and like journaling about the roots of your sin and how you‚Äôve fallen out of grace with god and whatnot. I take the opportunity to sneak off and shoot up in the wooded areas whenever we break to write our journals. It‚Äôs kind of peaceful out there but, real shit, it seems like there‚Äôs this ‚Äúshadow of death‚Äù or something looming over that whole place and it gives off this strange echo of bleak energy. It permeates the landscape and all the witless people caught in its black gaze. No, not even the Texas sun can seem to get through to the shadow-lost souls stranded out here in gods forsaken country‚Ä¶

Kennan sleeps naked in the bunk next to mine both nights. His snores fill the entire cabin and are also punctuated by sporadic screams, night terrors, and unholy mumbling provided by the other happy campers in the cabin.

The last day of the camp is Sunday. D-day I guess. Everyone gathers in the large chapel hall. They separate the girls on one side and the guys on the other. The main pastor, a lantern jawed well-payed looking guy addresses everyone up at the front and explains how the Deliverance is to proceed..

‚ÄúNow in a minute I‚Äôm going to start praying and things will be let loose in the spirit. I want all eyes looking up at me. I can see an unclean spirit when it‚Äôs trying to interfere or come out so if I look at you and point, don‚Äôt freak out. I‚Äôm just signaling a co-pastor to go to you and pray and the spirit will be set loose and cast back down into the pit.‚Äù

The mood is tense and uneasy, I‚Äôm kinda freaked out by what he‚Äôs saying but I took a huge shot before so I‚Äôm just kinda observing from a distance within myself. People start squirming around and nervous-ticking here and there and then he starts praying.

At first it‚Äôs just a general prayer thanking the lord Jesus for his mercy and stating that we all come into agreement that ‚Äúhis will be done.‚Äù A low collective-choir of moaning voices rises and vibrates through the room.

‚ÄúI cast out every unclean spirit into the pit! The spirit of lust. The Spirit of greed. The Spirit of sexual immorality. The Spirit of alcoholism. The Spirit of schizophrenia. The Unclean spirit of homosexuality. The Spirit of witchcraft. The Spirit of the occult. The Spirit of adultery. The Spirit of intellectualism. The Spirit of idolatry. The Spirit of heroin. The Spirit of crack cocaine. The spirit of liver disease. Every unclean spirit of beastiality. The spirit of cancer. The spirit of arthritis. The Spirit of lies and deceit. The spirit of covid 19!! Every unclean spirit I cast you out into the pit!‚Äù

He continues on and on with his list. The room is now roaring with anguish and maniacal screaming. All around me people are being prayed over and brought to lay on the floor and then blankets placed over them. Tears are streaming around the room with fear filled yells of ‚Äúthank you lord Jesus‚Äù and raised hands.

Part 3

I skip out on the ‚ÄúHallelujah evening feast‚Äù and call Jackie O to come pick me up. I call my aunt and uncle and tell them that I‚Äôm getting a ride back with Richie so they don‚Äôt have to pick me up. They ask me ‚Äúso did it come out?‚Äù

The car ride back I tell Jackie everything that happened and everything that‚Äôs been haunting my mind the last few weeks or so. She listens to me recount all the goings on at the Deliverance. She seems genuinely disgusted with all the blas√© Christian bigotry and then is completely nonplussed by the ‚Äúfucking mass exorcism!?‚Äù

Back at her place she tells curandera grandma Leche (pronounced Lee-Che, like Guevara) about my time out of town. They‚Äôre talking in Spanish so I‚Äôm not able to interject at all. Jackie O uses emphatic hand motions and incredulous-raised eyebrows while she goes on an exclamatory diatribe about the ‚Äúcult shit‚Äù I just went through. Leche nods, and glances at me while I sit cross legged on the brown carpeted floor. Jackie O holds my wrist with warm kindness and a genuine compassion, her eyes welling up when she looks at me. She translates for her grandma. ‚ÄúLeche says she wants to help you. Luke was a disciple of Jesus. the spiritual wounds you carry in your mind need to be washed away so that they don‚Äôt follow down to the next generation. But they must be washed with blood‚Äù

‚ÄúSientate mijito‚Äù

They light candles and place them around the room, they‚Äôre those long religious looking ones with pictures of saints on them and stuff. Jackie O puts down a blue checkered picnic table cloth underneath me. Leche brings out a big container and a smaller one. The first large container is a bill millers gallon size tea-bucket filled with a viscous red syrup. She places it behind me and tilts my head back. She grabs the other small plastic butter container, it‚Äôs empty. She dunks the little container in the blood and begins chanting over me in Spanish. She marks my forehead with a red wet thumb, and pours the blood on my forehead like she‚Äôs rinsing shampoo off of a baby‚Äôs head. She does this a few times, and then wrings out my long sticky hair, collecting the thick fluid back into the large coagulating tea-bucket.

Later in the evening and after a shower we eat cabrito tacos for dinner and I realize where the blood came from and why Leche keeps goats in the backyard. The cabrito was delicious though. I thanked Leche for doing her curandera stuff and for the meal. The mood was joyous and light as we all ate at the table, like I hadn‚Äôt felt in a long while. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome mijito.‚Äù

Part 4

Back in her room Jackie O. gives me a big fat crack rock all to myself. I use a blue pen tube and suck up thick crack clouds of smoke from the charred foil and hold it in. Jackie strips down to a black thong and gets on her knees. Her brown skin and dark hair arouse me with a forgotten lustful vigor. I take big cloud hits deeper and deeper into a euphoric stupor while Jackie O deep throats my granite hard cock. She goes slow and rhythmic while slobbering messily down the shaft of my cock and I feel the warm wetness of her saliva drip down my balls. She glides her tongue down to my ass in one long breathy motion. The steam from her nostrils makes my balls shrink up and her tongue ungulates small licks on the rim of my ass. I cum so hard I think my heart might stop and for a minute time stops and I‚Äôm just vibrating ecstasy. I crash back into my body when Jackie O chokes my cock with a forceful grip and swallows every last drop she squeezes out of me while fingering my g spot. I grab her waist and pull her on top of me like a 69. I pull her panties to the side and plunge my middle and ring finger deep into her wet lips and start fingering her like a spastic jackhammer. She starts shaking with quivering thighs. her pussy slowly pulsates, squirting with little puddles that I lap up and swallow, licking every drop off her body. I cum again.

In the morning I fix us up a shot with the last bit of dope and cottons I have. We talk about me becoming a father and I tell her if it‚Äôs a boy ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to name him Jesus.‚Äù

2020-08-27 07:25:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ihj9yy/just_wanna_talk/,Just wanna talk,"Hi all. So for whatever reason I haven't heard much from this sub in my home section, so I kind of set it to the wayside. Recently, I started having the thought of going out and picking up some cannabis (not my drug of choice, but it's abundant) and I was probably gonna go to a shop either today or tomorrow. Then, for whatever reason, I saw a post about why more people aren't using this sub. I don't know if it's the universe talking to me, but I've certainly come to use it as my higher power and boy is that a sign. I think the urge has subsided mostly, but I really hope that all my family is working hard out there to stay clean and work through their addiction, whatever it may be. Everyone is so beautiful and we can work through our urges and cravings if we listen to our intuition and the signs placed before us. If you're struggling, take some time to listen to what others are saying on here or wherever else you choose to listen, because listening isn't just about hearing, it's about paying attention to all of your senses and if one is out of whack, the whole building will crumble. 

That's all I wanted to say and I love each and every one of you. Make sure to say the same to yourselves :)",4

Today would have been 339. Today is day 3.","I know right from wrong, and at the end of the day I accept full responsibility for my choices. 

I still would like to explain the circumstances tho...

Due to the Covid situation, I went from weekly probation visits, to phone meetings. I haven‚Äôt seen my PO once since 3/18. I also had been approved eventual transfer to another state, and had planned on moving 9/6, which lead me to quitting work to have time with friends/family. 

So basically I had a ton of free time with zero supervision. With it I decided to create a situation that lead me to my choices. 

A little over 2 weeks ago I decided I could drink. That lead to me doing some adderal the same night, and while still drunk the next morning I got into a fight with family. I had kept contact with one toxic friend from the past, and in a drunk, emotional, and careless mental state I wound up hitting him up.

By 9am I was home, in the bathroom, and I shot up just like I had a million times before in a past life. After that the lying started, the guilt started, and I kept using despite it being awful this time. Every time someone asked about my sobriety I lied. Every time they clapped in group, it was a lie. Every time I looked at my false day counter, I looked at a lie. Every lie added guilt, and every shot was a temporary band aid. 

About a week ago, my dad showed up in town with my sisters. They are the family I was moving to be close to. Last Sunday we all went camping. My Dad kept telling me how proud he was, and how excited he was for us to have a real relationship. Then he broke the news that he decided after 26 years to move home. This has always been my biggest dream, to have all my family close. So the plan was for me to tell probation on Tuesday, cancel the transfer, and request leave for 45 days to help him get his house ready to sell for the move. 

The next morning I got home, and shot up for the last time. Monday, 8/24/2020. 

Tuesday morning I spoke with my PO for the first time since relapse. I chickened out, and couldn‚Äôt ask him to give me the pass to leave state. I couldn‚Äôt because that requires trust, and trust requires honesty. 

I wound up awake all night, and into Wednesday morning with my guilt at an all time high knowing what had to be done. I have been staying with my mom for about a month waiting to move, and I woke her up at 6:30am to tell her the truth. She was understanding, but when I told her my plan to tell my PO she absolutely lost it entirely. In her mind that was it... I‚Äôve already been revoked twice, and next time I‚Äôll be given my suspended prison sentence.

I knew that the likelihood of him revoking me for it was extremely low, but still there. I also knew that there was a likelihood of jail time. I knew we would lose a lot of the ground we had gained, I may get more supervision, and may even get put back in residential treatment. I also knew that I would most likely be told I couldn‚Äôt go to Oregon at the very least.... which meant my Dad FINALLY needed me for the first time, and at 29 years old I was still letting him down. Despite of all this risk, at 8am I called my probation officer, then told him the truth.

He thanked me for my honesty, offered support, and is letting me go. No jail, no sanction, and no loss of trust. Instead I learned that I could gain trust thru being honest when 99% of people would have lied.

I called my therapist, and am restarting intensive outpatient, and then redoing relapse prevention. Another 6 months of groups total that I had just gone thru, with my last one being next Tuesday. 

I called my dad and told him, and he wasn‚Äôt mad or disappointed. Just supportive. He told me he was still proud of me, and that he respected me for being a man about it. You have no idea how much that meant to me.

I admitted everything to the rest of the people in my life, and they were all supportive as well. There wasn‚Äôt a single person who was negative.

I learned that honesty is what I needed to set myself free again. Not having that guilt just absolutely smothering me gave me a relief that I never expected. Seeing that people didn‚Äôt hate me like I thought they would was the exact opposite of what the drug made me believe.

It feels different this time. I started last time having no interest in quitting, I just got used to it. This time I truly want to, and last time taught me its possible. 

I chose to be a man, when I chose to be honest. 

I would rather be an honest man in a cell, than be a lying boy that‚Äôs free. 

In this whole journey thru recovery we sometimes fuck up. You never know what circumstances, and situations you are going to encounter that may lead you to relapse. It doesn‚Äôt make you less, it doesn‚Äôt just take away the days you were clean, and you don‚Äôt have to just give up entirely. 

If you are reading this, and find yourself in that loop of relapse, guilt, and using I want you to know that honesty will set you free. It‚Äôs okay to be vulnerable. You don‚Äôt have to hide, and do things alone. You don‚Äôt have to be embarrassed, addiction is the easiest thing on earth, and recovery is one of the hardest.

Digging and twisting i go back to the basement down the steps where her apartment laid and i run to the back closet. 
It was a literal metaphor of what we had become, on that mirror in the shadows on a damp basement surrounded by dog shit.
I was shit. I felt the grit on my pores, my teeth clenched tight, my eyes wide and beaty knowing I will feel balanced soon.

Even tho Shame hit every fucking time i still wasn't above feeling or doing anything that could help me escape who i was in those years, in any way I could.

Id say each time, one more line and im done.
Then into the bath tub i go.
I crawl in my skin waiting for my mind to release a little dopamine so i can try to feel any sense of relief again. 
It makes it worse making me thinkI'm better 
As i wash my body the water is warmer than my heart could ever be again. 
I was walking around dead, sunk in cheeks and black circles dwelling in my skull beneath my eyes
. Paranoid daily accompined with violently sad thoughts and lost moments in time. Gaps...

I lost myself in that basement with her, countless times, rambling as i lost my mind and started to turn into a person i truly did not know. 
Betrayal is an understatement. 
Not only had I betrayed myself, but my best friend in this entire world who i thought knew me better than me, hurt me in more ways than i could imagine .

And not the drugs, that honestly was not the worst part of this. 
Hate to admit it but i had some really great times being spun with her. 
But in the same breath, i never saw someone get chewed up and spit back at me with such vigor in my life. 
I was scared, but more scared of who she was about to become. 
I saw then i couldn't stop it, so i just joined. 
Misery fucking loves company.
¬†I found out you can't help someone who doesn't want help. 
You can fix a situation you enabled. 
You can't have your best friend back, she died a long time ago between the switch from alcohol to hard drugs, to even harder drugs even after 2 of our friends over dosed this year.
I couldn't ever save her and in trying so made me look like a fucking fool. 
And the whole time i was just there for her, to validate her, to reassure her and then join in on all the chaos. 
To be told i was nothing to her all along, which I felt but denied for years.
But
I loved chaos, the impulsive nights, i love what we created even if it wasn't forever.
It scared me tho
cos i loved her. I believed in her and still hope the best for her.
It sounds like a twisted break up and feels quite similar, i dont remeber ever in my life being so close to someone before sonya.
Sharing all of me knowing they'd never judge me or me judge them.
And that part is true, which makes it so hard.
Yet i am so angry i can't fathom the thought of ever having any sort of true friendship with her again. 
Cos what we shared was all a lie..n it took a while for me to accept that.

But i cant exhaust myself for her any longer. 
There is so much left unsaid but it doesn't feel like she ever cared, or i ever mattered then so why would I now?
It hurts, it hurts knowing she may never change and i feel like I'm a thread away from loosing another fucked up friend to drugs or suicide. 
It's a cycle im ready to break from, and started last year. 
I won't kill myself for them, i have long enough. 
I dont ever want to talk to her again, and i hope she chooses to ignore me if we are seen outside.
I will not have it, or her in my head any longer. 
I never knew my best friend.",3

The difference is that it‚Äôs normalized in his family and not seen as an issue. He‚Äôs been talking more and more about drinking with his family and experimenting with drugs, disregarding our agreement. He‚Äôs been guilt tripping me, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing anything wrong since I told him how I am about that before we even started dating. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

This drug casts so many false illusions while simultaneously giving off a euphoria unlike anything I've ever tried.  The brain because a buzz with what I call the ""interest and intrigue"" filter.  It's one of a few reasons why I keep going back to it after any amount of sobriety.

I was just released from jail. I had some time to think about a lot of things. 3 years ago i went thru a divorce; I  was broken from that. Those years when i was married was the happiest I've ever been. i still hurts me inside to be honest. Before I was married I spent 18 months in a program that held me accountable and gave me food and shelter; honestly it made me a man with good work ethic and moral values. Before that I was addicted to opiates on and off and cooking methamphetamine. i was an IV drug user. i contracted HepC like many other people (I believe that needles should be freely purchased without prescription as harm reduction and the vile act of reusing needles). My past goes on all the way, well to birth if i was being literal, however still relevant. I was the kid put in the hallway for disrupting the class, picked last for sports, hesitant to sit anywhere during lunch for fear of being told to move. My home life was rough as a kid too. It was child abuse. My dad admits it I forgive him and love him. He sincerely regrets the beatings he gave me, pulling me up from my hair and whack whack whack whack whack whack whack, kind of beatings. i entered High School with a very low self esteem. i know i was attractive because at first glance all these girls had crushes on me and would get their friends to tell me this. that is until they noticed my social status. My freshman year in my first class of the day I remember looking around at all the cliques of friends some were football player some were track stars some were just adorned by everyone because had some form of identity that gave them a confidence that people were drawn to. I on the other hand thought ""what am i? whats my identity?"" that was the very moment i decided to be a drug user. No peer pressure No idea where to start. then it clicked. GASOLINE i started huffing gas. Thru telling my experience to other social rejects i discovered DXM. i met a drug dealer by chance at a gas station asking for someone to buy cigarettes. i was the youngest and only person i knew with a solid weed connect. Time goes on i nearly did not make it out of high school. i had no choice but to apply myself a little to make the grades i needed. STRAIGHT A's? it surprised me went to college I was on the deans list. Time goes on i enjoyed taking a couple lortab and going jog or play tennis. it was hard to find people to play with so i practiced my serve ALOT and would sometimes find a playmate. can you guess what happens next OXYs then life went to shit. i was 20 yrs old with a 40 yr old sugar momma i was a piece of shit dope head that couldn't hold a job and would rob you blind. why in the hell would i do drugs. why was my life so hard. why did i hurt so much inside.

LONELINESS!!! 

if i had fellowship and felt as if i belonged somewhere my life would not have been the same.

if you see someone by themselves all the time you may hear them say ""i don't care what people think"" but i assure you they do.

These days I'm fine. I advocate Kratom and use it frequently I am also on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications all prescribed by a doctor. i am no longer a drug addict and i am no longer depressed I am 33 and I am a healthy young man with plenty of potential",1

Best part is the money I'm not spending on all these things and feeling like I'm more in control of my life. Worst parts are figuring out new ways of coping with the intense periods of anxiety and depression and pushing away friends who are still in the same addictions. 

The last several days I've been pluaged by thoughts of how different I am now than I was 5 or 10 years ago because of these addictions, the choices I made, and the isolation that came with it. How I hurt the people who cared about me the most, who were there for me when I wasn't there for myself, used them, then ignored them and stopped caring about anyone altogether. How I fix or rebuild those relationships, I can't even begin to imagine. It's not like I even did anything seriously heinous but nevertheless it was and still is fucked up. The shame and guilt still holds a lot of weight. It's easier and less scary to do nothing than it is to try to rebuild but doing nothing is what I've been good at. I keep asking myself, do I even want to rebuild those relationships? A part of me says yes but the other part says it's been too long, I've already done enough damage by my passivity, and too much has changed, so there's no point. I'm not the same person they remember, nor are they the same I remember. 

I just want things to go back to when things were different but that's impossible. Things will never be like they used to be. I'll always be seen as either the scapegoat or pariah, if not both because now all the bullshit of me caring so much and being a good person is out the window. The illusion I've tried to project for years is gone and I'm still not sure that realization has really even settled inside of me. This projecting and blaming bullshit is all a diversion from the truth, that I'm responsible for all of my issues. I chose this path. Whether out of fear, pain, or out of desperation, either way I chose this path.

Now, where I go from here? I don't really know. I'm focused on myself right now but it feels very selfish, even though you'd think I should be used to it. I can't tell you or anyone what I'm doing tomorrow cause I don't even know myself. I just wing it day by day, try to establish better habits, and do my best not to get stuck back in the same ruts that have caused my un-wellness to begin with. 

I'm certain my life, demeanor, and behavior look very weird and strange from the outside but in reality I'm just feeling my way through the dark holding a light that only shines 6 feet in front of me. Sometimes the light flickers, dims, and I freeze in place, not knowing what to say or do, but the light always seems to come back on and in rare moments even gets brighter. My greatest hope is that a time will come when there isn't a need for that flashlight anymore, all the lights will be on, and everything will finally be clear inside and out. That hope is the only thing that keeps going.

During my high school years, I played 5 hours a day on school days and 13 hours a day on weekends and vacations. After exceeding 4000 hours on the game I played (Wakfu). I decided to take my life more seriously. My life was important, my time was important. I managed to get rid of my addiction to this game by selling my account. Unfortunately, my addiction only moved to youtube, wikipedia (yes, I know, it's weird), and streaming sites in general. I've tried to block addictive sites but unfortunately, I often need them for my studies. So I developed a chrome extension to fit me and the website. Not to block the default website but rather to propose 4 different modes adapted to the situation: notification, request for confirmation of continuation, blocking, and closing the browser. I've been using my extension for some time now and I really feel a big improvement. If you share some common points with me, don't hesitate to try it and give me your opinion !

A. They were taking 4 pills at a time (I don‚Äôt know of what)


B. When I asked what they were taking, they didn‚Äôt know. They had said they threw the bottle into the woods near them, but I suspect it to be something you‚Äôd have lying around the house. (tylenol type of thing).

and

C. I believe they were only taking them at night, so most likely only 4 a day. From what I was told, or how they conversation went, I don‚Äôt believe/ think they have grown a dependency, but it had seemed like that could have been where it was going.",3

I have struggled with addiction since I was 17 I am now 40 years old. I have a wonderful wife that is a teacher and 3 teenagers. I thought I could win this battle but I fail time and time again. Sometimes I feel like maybe it's because I don't want to give them up (addictions) My wife and I have been together 16 years. I have put her through so much of my shit. In the past I have been verbally abusive, lied too many times to count, manipulated her, when gambling was my drug of choice I would spend my entire weeks pay. Gambling has just been one of many addictions I've battles along with just about every major hard drug ever known. My wife and kids have had to bear the brunt of my weakness. Fortunately, I have managed to keep my addiction away from them. Last April I picked up a new addition methamphetamine. My mom had just been diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer and I turned to my demons to cope just like every time before. Not long before that I managed to quit cocaine which I had been using regularly for 10+ years prior. When my mother died my meth addiction spiraled out of control. By October of last year I was staying awake for several days at a time, isolating myself in my room and bathroom only to come out to re-up. That month I had a near death experience that I thought at the time had saved my life. Now I think it was just a meth induced psychosis. However it did force me to get clean. And I stayed clean til July of this year before I relapsed again. 

We used to live about 12 mi. South of where we are currently. That's where all my addict ""friends"" live. every time I relapsed into some drug that I chose to indulge myself in, that's where I run to. I had tried to convince my wife in the past that to be successful at sobriety long term I had to get away from that town (I actually grew up there) My drug use started there and thats where my brain would always lead me back to. It's like the town had a spell on me. I tried so hard to fight the beckoning to go there cause if I did I knew what was about to go down. 

This year in July I found out that my 14 year old daughter was sexually Assaulted by a 24 yr old man that lived here in our apartment complex. We found out because she snuck off to the beach and we found out, grounded her and took her phone. We usually did phone checks but it always turned out good so at that point we had built a trust with her in regards to her phone. That was a huge mistake. When we took her phone we found all the correspondence between her and this man and it described to us that evidently he was preying upon her, giving her drugs and luring her over to the Hotel across the street from our apartments. This devestated me. I took full responsibility for everything that happened to her. I told myself that it was my fault that I should have protected her. That's my job. The entire time her mom and I thought she was playing with friends up near the front of the complex. I told myself that I failed her as a father. We did file charges on the man and he was charged with aggravated sexual Assault of a Minor and solicitation of a Minor. When he lured her into the hotel room she was 13. I fell into a pit of self loathing. I was already in a lot of pain from a Gastric Bypass Surgery that id had in June. I couldn't eat which was another weakness I had. That past year off meth I would cope with my issues by eating. I had put on a tremendous amount of weight. to the point that I was in excruciating Pain just from walking. I had the bypass to nip that problem In the bud and lose the weight. Unfortunately while the surgery changed me physically it couldn't change me psychologically. So I was still addicted to food. Junk food, sweets etc . It was in lieu of the meth at that point. so I figured that with the bypass and me being clean for several months, I was doing the very best I could do. I am on SSDI for Bipolar 2 and I believed with my new thinner drug free me, I would soon be off SSDI and on the path to finally becoming successful And getting off SSDI forever. 

So after all this went down and me playing a pity party with myself and unable to scarf down snack cakes and milkshakes I became more vulnerable to that voice that had up to that point more less silent after several months clean. The voice slowly became louder and louder as the days went by I was suffering emotionally. Being Bipolar didn't really help me out even though I was on medication they soon felt like they stopped working and left me in this extremely vulnerable state. This whole time I'm blaming myself for what happened to my daughter and dwelling on every other mistake I'd made. 

After about a month I seemed fall slowly into a deep depression so bad I couldn't get out of bed. My body ached all over. I just felt sick. This is during Corona also, so the stress from being locked down it all just compiled and compressed Down to where my life at that point was unstable once again. Before I knew and I  am not exaggerating, I basically went into some kind of zombie mode and went to Alvin with the intention of scoring something. I ended up getting cocaine. I told myself it would take the edge off. I would try to convince my brain this was entirely the wrong way to go, but no matter what I'd tell myself, I just kept going. So I scored the coke and did it locked up in my bathroom all night lying to my wife telling her I was constipated. I knew that was wrong to do but I couldn't admit to her I'd relapsed. I finished the coke in one night. So come the next night there I was again driving the 12 miles back. This time I copped some crystal. And again I was back in the bathroom sick. Yeah I was sick. I'd relapsed petal to the metal cause once I snorted a rail of crystal and it took away all my sorrow, I mentally decided fuck it I'm all In. I already screwed up. I was a failure. Screw it. enjoy the freedom from pain and misery. 

So here I am , I don't even know how many days later on my 4th score. I did admit to my wife I relapsed Saturday and told her I just didn't know if I could keep fighting. I told her that I considered suicide and I was in so much pain and I didn't feel confident I could go back and fight this on top of every thing else. I was just being 100 percent honest. I didn't want to lie to her. She of course forgave me and told me she just wanted me to feel better. I know she does but I just don't feel that I can go back to the suffering. I didn't know if I could confidently battle this. As of right now I ask myself can I get sober again? Do I want to be sober? I can't honestly answer that question. 

I do know one thing for sure I refuse to put my wife through the hell of my addiction again. Or my children even though they only see the byproduct of it. (me sleeping through the day) and feeling ill. (comedown) they have never seen me use and I know that isn't an excuse cause it's wrong no matter how you try to present it.  It's bullshit. I already seen the stress starting to emerge in her demeanor. She's quiet so she won't just come out and say it. She's being supportive. Again. But hell, I don't want her to be nice to me or supportive I want her to be furious. Ready to kick me out. 

So that being said, making the determination that I was not confident in getting sober and slightly questioning if I even wanted sobriety, I will do what she should do. I am going to leave until I can get sober. That's not an excuse to keep getting high at all. ( I believe) I'm pretty sure of that. I determined that to be successful long term I cannot be anywhere near my hometown. There is no way. Cause I know as soon as some kind of tragedy strikes or I feel like I can't take anymore stress I'm back on auto pilot back to where I started. They do not deserve that at all. I know if I do get treatment it ultimately cannot be here. Bring Bipolar and my history my chances of completing a program are slim because all Id have to do is check myself out and go back to where the action is. On autopilot. That autopilot scares the hell out of me. That is not me that is something outside who I am that is controlling my every word and movement. I am officially powerless over this other person. That person lies, manipulates, sneaks money out of the bank and tries to cover it up. Hell don't even try to cover it up. Don't really care if she knows or not. I don't like that person who is not me but part of my psyche that emerges when shit hits the fan he tags me out I tag him in. I don't know who the hell he is. But it's not me. In my mind least. It's someone that is part of me but not ultimately me as a person. 

So coming to those conclusions, I've decided to kick myself out of the house. If I am going to check into a rehab and try to once and for all live a life of sobriety it's going to be far from here. That way if I leave I have nowhere to go. I'm homeless. And my wife and kids to do not have to bear the brunt of my bad decisions. I am thinking about going to Arizona. To the desert somewhere that has in the past given me inner peace living there briefly in 2006. I think clean and sober when I imagine that place. So I believe that's where my heart is leading me. I know if I don't go or choose to get clean once and for all I will lose everything. That has to be something that is a consequence. I can't put them through this anymore. They are older now so I believe they can handle Dad leaving for a while I don't worry about that. One thing I do consider is coming back here and down the road from loserville. My hometown. I don't expect will I ask her to leave her career as a teacher at a school she loves and has many years at. I do not expect my kids to leave the schools or their friends because I can't get my life together. That's not fair. I asked in the past and begged actually and she didn't want to leave. I believe she had confidence that I could beat this addiction and we could live happily here. So this time I will not ask. I will go. I am no good and no use to anyone in my condition. I know it was a relapse but relapses for me are not minor slip ups. My addiction grows bigger and more out of control and the substances become harder and more dangerous. I refuse to let her find me dead on the bathroom floor of an OD. she doesn't deserve it. At least this way I am alive if I can convince myself I can achieve long term sobriety. It has to be for good this time. No half ass recoveries that last 6 mos or 1 year.  I'm 40 now. This has to either stop or I need to go permanently. If she decides to come to Arizona after I have maintained sobriety and that what she chooses that is what I want. If not, I will at least be alive and able to be in children's lives. 

Either way, the BS had to stop. I'm done disappointing my family and put them through unwarranted stress and pain. I have to me a man and take responsibility for myself and my decisions good and bad. This has gone on for entirely too long.

I remember when my son was 4 we put him into hockey. 

The first day he played was the first time he put on skates. 

I remember him stepping on the ice and he fell down. I watched from the stands crying as he just lay there trying to get up. It took a few minutes as I watched helplessly until The ref picked him up and brought him to the bench. My son was visibly upset. As I was. 

He sat out the first shift and when it was his turn he stepped on the ice and he fell right back down, where he remained the entire shift. I felt that he wasn‚Äôt ready to play and considered taking him out of the league until next year. The coach picked him up and brought him on the bench. 

This continued for the entire game. 

At the end of the game he was crying but wanted to keep trying. 

As the season progresses he would continually fall and eventually be able to stand. Then I noticed his teammates cheer him on and help him up whenever he fell. He was part of the team. 

After struggling with Mental Health, addiction/alcoholism, and not knowing any longer where in life I fit in.  I can‚Äôt help but feel the similarities. 

If I was to look at things as my son. No matter how many times I fell or couldn‚Äôt stand my family would be watching on crying. The coach I‚Äôd associate with that first person who said the words ‚ÄúI can help‚Äù who helped guide me and show me a place where I could learn to stand up on my own. 

My teammates would be the connections and friends I have made over the past while and who support me unconditionally.  Especially those I can talk to online during this pandemic and my mother, who has become my best friend. 

I still need to find the ref who got me to the bench in the first place.

But I‚Äôm going to play the game until he comes. 

Last year my son won (at 9 years) the MVP during a hockey tournament that I was unable to attend as I was in a treatment Center attempting to fix myself.  I may have fallen since but without their lessons I wouldn‚Äôt know how to get back up... or at least have the courage to ask for help. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure of two things. If I didn‚Äôt reach out, and if no one cared I wouldn‚Äôt be around today. 

I‚Äôm hoping one day I can be his MVP. 
I‚Äôll fight until then, as we all should. People out there will help. You just need to find one and ask.",5

I was taking psychiatric meds at the same time, i don‚Äôt know if it effected my tolerance but it didn‚Äôt take a lot to get high. My parents saw I was struggling and sent me to rehab, in fear that weed was a gateway drug like people generically say. When I was there there were people that were addicted to a lot harder drugs than I was, so they were more important to care for and help. I know weed isn‚Äôt psychically addictive by the textbook, but I felt like I wanted help. I saw a lot of people struggling with harder drugs and larger quantities and i thought i was a joke compared to them so i just tried to rationalize with myself and tell myself I don‚Äôt need help. 

I feel like a loser and i feel like I could be disrespecting other addicts when i try and ask for help. It was just weed and it was a really small amount. But when it wasn‚Äôt weed it was people, and Ive continued to damage a lot of relationships since I‚Äôve been sober. 

Im bipolar and i get prescribed Klonopin to help with anxiety. My tolerance is still really low when it comes to Klonopin, and I‚Äôve known to be smart about taking it because it could get me into some trouble. 

To sum up the last few days Ive been wanting to destroy my life recently, so I started taking it more recently and i took 3 of them in one week and i began to lose track of the days and it really scared me. I‚Äôm able to rationalize with myself and stop myself from taking any more, but I still feel like I need help. 

I feel like I don‚Äôt count as an addict, and I don‚Äôt want to claim that I‚Äôm one because I would never want to offend anyone that‚Äôs struggling. 
I keep trying to distract myself but I keep feeling like I‚Äôm gonna fall back into the hole again. 

TLDR; I want help with my addictive tendencies, but I‚Äôm too scared to ask for help because I feel like I‚Äôm not sick enough to deserve support or empathy.",5

I have anxiety, and depression, and this time of the pandemic has been one of the most difficult things I have had to go through, even growing up in two dysfunctional homes, neglect, abuse, and divorce later on, this for me has been rough. 

I have not been able to run my business due to the pandemic, so I do not have the normal distractions I would during the summer to change my focus from these dark feelings I have about myself. It's hard, sitting with yourself, sitting with the discomfort and just learning to be ok with it, it's so damn uncomfortable! Normally I would go out, start using in one form or another and just numb myself to avoid dealing with the discomfort, but I know that won't help. 

I was laid off from my job as well, but I was given unemployment at least, and I am fortunate that I have friends, and a spouse, but it's hard because none of them really understand the discomfort. I just feel really alone at times and I have no one around me who really understands the pain and loathing that come with the core darkness of addiction. This pandemic is bringing out the worst in many of people, they are scared and understandably and it just feels like a s\*\*t pie we have to eat.

I was already quite hooked on coke and introduced her to the world of wonders. quite quickly she got hooked on speed (amphetamines) and because i was going through my own shit i didn‚Äôt realize how bad she got. in december she went to rehab and got back in march. she was on quite a good path until she relapsed and had a binge from april until june. i was trying to get her sober at first but in the end gave up and ended up doing shit with her aswell. (i have always been bad at saying no, and i was still using when she got out.) i already feel like an awful person for introducing her to drugs in the first place, then i fucked up with her first relapse. she got a girlfriend recently who helped her get sober and i was so proud but a couple of days ago she was having really bad cravings, and we ended up getting ketamine. today she texted me, she doesn‚Äôt want me to talk about drugs or anything about weight etc (i obsess over my weight a lot, especially when i gain, i‚Äôm not anorexic or anywhere close to underweight but i‚Äôm very self conscious). and i can tell shes extremly sad/angry at me, i am such an awful person and i know i shouldn‚Äôt be friends with her because it only leads to her relapsing but i don‚Äôt know what i would do if we weren‚Äôt friends, she‚Äôs the only person i trust, care about and want to spend time with. i just know that i shouldn‚Äôt be her friend and as long as i stick around she‚Äôs always gonna be at risk of relapsing.

At one point I literally had the lowest GPA in my entire school. This game I tried sacrificing everything for, I would pay real money in order to buy fake in game currency to be able to gamble in said game. I wanted to be the richest guy on the game and earn everyone's respect by having all the flashiest items and best stuff. Eventually, I got grounded from the game from missing so much school and never going outside. That didn't stop me. I would bike ride to a college campus 30 minutes away and jump on their free 15 minute session computers. Every 15 minutes I would get kicked off the game but I would log back in and keep playing. Anytime I received money for Christmas, birthdays, etc, I would bring my cash to a 7 - eleven and pay for prepaid debit cards and blow all my money to be able to gamble in the game. This happened for a long time, until, out of desperation to win, I took my moms credit cards and spent over $500 on the game and had to tell her what happened. Needless to say, she was not happy. I wasn't either. I sold all of my magic cards that I had been collecting my whole life in order to pay her back. These cards would now be worth more than $20,000 if I had kept them. Anyways, although this story probably means nothing to most people, I tell it for one reason: How many times have you ""gambled"" your lifestyle to win something for all of the wrong reasons? The truth is, nobody really cares about how much money you have, or how much better you are than them. In fact, it's quite the opposite. People care about how you made them feel and how you helped them. Looking back at all of the most important parts of my life, they all revolve around whether I felt really good, or really bad. I know for sure in the instance that I was chasing my dream to win, like I have 1000's of times, I was distracted from the true thing that brought me happiness. I really just wanted to be liked, I wanted friends. Even up until now, with SEO - I did the same thing. I tried edging everyone out, because I wanted to be better than them. Now, I try to help others as much as possible by inspiring them to work towards being better people and not worrying about arbitrary things that have nothing to do with living an awesome life. Anyways enough from me, has anything like this ever happened to you? Let me know! Enjoy your weekend!",9

I sat down and did the same thing I did so many years ago, and I was rudely awakened by my younger self‚Äôs thoughts, as foreign to my mind as I could attempt to express. Even just a second of hearing who I was made me understand exactly how numb I‚Äôve become to who I am. 

I woke to the sudden realization that I am a 9 YEAR meth addict, and it has gotten so bad now that I haven‚Äôt spent a week off of it in an entire year. 

I used to be a different fucking human being. Off to go try and be famous with my music. Off to college. I cared about my life. I cared about who I was, what I was doing. I got worried by normal things, small and large. I used to take care of my body. Fuck, I used to run five miles every day. I had a 4.0 gpa at university till the day I found meth. 

I USED TO RUN FIVE MILES EVERY DAY. 

Now I shoot enough dope to kill a small whale every day cause my tolerance is so high. I‚Äôm shooting half a gram of meth at a time, 10 times a day. If you‚Äôd asked me yesterday I‚Äôd say I feel completely fine all things considered. 

I dont fuck up my job, still got my teeth, shower every day, sleep eight hours a night, not crazy in the head, eat right.

I don't like beer, don't drink wine. At most, I enjoy some wodka with red bull, because of the sweet taste. Could easily drink 1-2 glasses each day, but I really don't have I have to. Having a glass of cola would be equally fulfilling. My last glass of alcohol is easily a few months ago.

Breaking it down, what does it take to raise a drinking addiction (aside of sudden mental problems, such as marriage or life problems)?

(FYI; I'm not worried, but rather interested in some theory)",1

&#x200B;

Nicotine was my substance of choice. I dipped for like 4 years. Then I started doing adderall (20-30 MG) daily, and drinking almost every day.

&#x200B;

I quit all 3 in early July. And I started drinking coffee. For about a month, I struggled to rely on Coffee and sugar to replace my addictions.

&#x200B;

I started fucking with weed a couple weeks ago, and it really helped with the withdrawal symptoms dramatically.

When I cut back on weed and coffee, I get terrible anxiety and irritation.

&#x200B;

I still crave alcohol, followed closely by coffee, marijuana and adderall.

I been sayin this shit about coffee, brehs. You quit everything else, and think ""Ill just have my morning cup""

What about when that morning cup turns to 2? What about when you need an afternoon cup and a nightcap?",0

2020-08-22 22:03:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/iev4f1/addicted_to_coin_flipping/,Addicted to coin flipping?,"When I was in high school I started flipping coins to decided small things like what flavored cake I wanted or what brand of pencils I should buy. There was a rule I made up that it could only be for small things, nothing important. Also that heads was yes and tails was no. One time, after a bit of thinking, I decided to flip to decide if I should attend an after school event or not. I got heads and went and had a great time. I was also a bit more religious in high school, not super, but I had a lot of faith in God. I figured that maybe the result of the coin was a sign from fate and that I should trust it. It was around this point that I felt coin flipping might have been influencing me too much.

Thank god I didn't flip a coin to decide where I wanted to go to college, but you can bet I had a strong urge to. But sometimes I do flip it for things I shouldn't. And the thought of going against it makes me super nervous although sometimes I do. The worst thing I flip coins for at the moment is texting people and making posts on social media. I even flip a coin asking if I should trust the coin. It drives me mad! I literally do it without thinking (most often by searching 'flip a coin' on Google on my phone). 

I've never met or heard anyone with them same addiction. Is it OCD? I hate it. I really really do try to stop and tell myself to trust myself, but sometimes I do give in to it.",1

I would say im a bright kid, i can pick up information fairly fast. I am intersted in histoty but never try to learn about it or cause i would rather play video games, like i said its not fun anymore but i always see myself longing to play them, but when i do, i dont want to play (if that makes sense).

I think I‚Äôm addicted to sex. When I was 13 I lost my virginity to an 18 year old and it all went down hill from there. I was very young so it affected how I viewed my sexual relationships and from there I slept with everyone and anyone. After a few years I met my partner. We‚Äôve lived together for over a year and we have had sex every single day without miss (even on my monthly). We have sex multiple times a day and have even skipped work just to have sex. Is it a problem or something I have to worry about? Like we both will be the worst of moods if we go a whole day without sex and end up having multiple rounds in a night. Also we both masturbate semi regularly too. Im just curios if I should consider it a problem.,4

2020-08-22 14:07:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ienaju/xanax_withdrawals/,Xanax withdrawals,"I was diagnosed with depression, panic attack , chronic insomnia when I was around 18. My psychiatrist prescribed me Xanax with some other antidepressants. During the first year the medicines had worked really well. I was free of all those depression, no suicidal thoughts, no anxiety, and I could sleep just fine. 

After a year my body had built up a tolerance so I took more and more pills to achieve the same feeling. I‚Äôd called my psychiatrist more often and I‚Äôd literally lied to his face about my conditions because I wanted more pills. However, it takes like a month for the shipping process because I‚Äôm studying aboard. I couldn‚Äôt waited that long, so I buy pills from the street instead. I was 19, stranded with thousands of miles from my hometown, popping pills, smoking dope just to make my trouble goes aways. This went on for about 4 years.

I would do stuffs I don‚Äôt remember. It‚Äôs like my body is on auto pilot. I‚Äôd lose my temper real fast. Sometimes I‚Äôd not eat for days then eat like crazy. My short term memory started to decay. I forgot a people whom I‚Äôd met an hour before. I forgot classes lecture as soon as I went out the room. However, I didn‚Äôt care because I thought I was happy and it was worth it.

Eventually, my body just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. First it took like 3-4 pills a day. Then it went up to 4-5 pills an hour. The most I took was about 60 mg a day. As I keep popping more and more pills, unwanted side affects and health issues started to show up. Then I quit, cold turkey. 2020 pandemic crisis makes it impossible for me to get my hands on those pills. Plugs are gone, mailing meds would take like forever. So I have a withdrawal, real bad one.
(For those who are not familiar with xanax, it only take a few hours after the last does for withdrawal symptoms to kick in.)

Withdrawal on xanax is the hell on earth. The world around me came crushing. It‚Äôs like I get carried to a place where happiness doesn‚Äôt exist. I overthink about everything. I can‚Äôt see a thing with my eyes. It‚Äôs so foggy. I felt like I was turning blind. Depression level rises to its peak. I have to lock my self aways in my room because I‚Äôm no longer functional. It‚Äôs a cold place where I live but I feel like my body is burning. I feel paranoid literally about everything. And anxiety? Breathing makes me feel anxiety. Panic attack all the time. Normal panic attack is already bad but panic attack when you‚Äôre withdrawing is ten times as bad. It‚Äôs like you get stuck in your body and you couldn‚Äôt breathe. What do you do when you can‚Äôt breathe? You try breathing harder but part of your brain doesn‚Äôt register those air. A minute would feel like an hour when you can‚Äôt breathe. Some people calls it land drowning. My body is shaking all the time. The worst of the worst is that I can‚Äôt escape it. I can‚Äôt go to sleep! Sleeping is impossible at this point. My body is tired but my mind won‚Äôt let me sleep. 4-5 days without sleeping can seriously mess with your brain. I started to see shadow people, hear someone calling out my name every 5 min, hear someone scratching behide the wall. After a week, I‚Äôm strong enough to go out and get some sleeping pills. I bought every sleeping pill I can get my hands on. It works but it also give me extreme nightmares. Drug withdrawal nightmare is the experience that only people who goes through it would know. I basically went to hell when I sleep. It‚Äôd felt like a month, a year had passed in the dream but in reality it was only 3-4 hours. I‚Äôd get confused and cry as soon as I wake up, scared of falling sleep again. Everything that make me feel unhappy, bad memories, bad experiences, fears, pains, all this times ten when I go to sleep.

It has been almost 6 months now since I stay sober. No xanax, no antidepressants, no weed, no sleeping pill, nothing. Only cigarette sometimes.
All these withdrawal symptoms are mostly gone but I still have insomnia, depression. Panic attack seems to be better. Sometimes I still feel a drug craving but I won‚Äôt give up. I know I can‚Äôt survive another withdrawal.

0/10 would not recommend using this drug.

2020-08-22 13:56:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ien3cx/my_brother_is_in_recovery_how_can_i_support_him/,"My brother is in recovery, how can I support him","I‚Äôm hoping to gain an insight from all perspectives. My brother is recovering and is currently in rehab. He‚Äôs had an a opioid addiction for years which led to heroin and it has been extremely hard. Our family has been through a whole lot of shit because of this. I love my brother and try to be there as much as I can but every time he gets sober he falls right off so it‚Äôs hard for us to put all of our faith in him that he‚Äôll stick to it. He‚Äôs stolen from all of us, gotten into physical fights with both myself, my oldest brother and even at times tries to go after my dad. He‚Äôs threatened to kill himself, cut his neck right in front of us. I‚Äôve had to pick him up off the floor countless times convulsing. 

He was trying to be in recovery a few months ago, he had random drug test due to his probation. Then covid happens and the courts shut down. No more drug tests meant free will and he went wild. 

I understand addiction is a disease and that he‚Äôs trying, but the way he hurts us when he‚Äôs high.. It‚Äôs just heartbreaking. At times I don‚Äôt feel safe around him or even in my home. I want to know how I can support him and be there for him while he is in recovery again. Nobody in my family talks about what my bro‚Äôs addiction has done to us. We just aren‚Äôt the type of family to talk about how we feel. And my brother doesn‚Äôt know how to verbalize how he feels. He‚Äôs been popping pills for so many years, his cognitive response even when he is sober, is a struggle for him. 

I am so angry at the pain he‚Äôs caused us and things he has done to his own family, just to get high. But I love him and want him to be happy and to get better. I don‚Äôt wanna hold on to his mistakes because I understand he‚Äôs hurting inside. 

I just want some help to understand.

I just turned 16 and now celebrate my achievement. My advice and inspirational story.,"Hello everyone, my addiction is probably a less morbid / bad addiction than others here in this subreddit. Even though it may not be as bad, it is nonetheless an addiction. From the age of 9 until 15 (I just turned 16), I was consuming almost 1000 mg of caffeine daily by drinking. I am talking about 3-4 cups of coffee in the morning, 2 cups of coffee at lunch, and 2-3 cups of coffee at dinner. If I couldn‚Äôt do that, then I would be consuming 1-2 cups of coffee in the morning, 0-1 cups of coffee after school, and loads of homemade STRONG iced tea. I am talking about 5-7 cups of tea everyday plus the coffee I drank. If I only had one cup of caffeinated beverage, my anger would be through the roof as I begged my mother for another coffee and become very agitated. My entire day would feel practically ruined after such an incident.

After school, I would sneakily go to the store and buy K-Cups with my debit card that way it couldn‚Äôt be tracked. I wasted a lot of money on that. My caffeine addiction was bad and it was fueled by the fact everyone else seems to live coffee and caffeine and that it was nice. I started reducing my caffeine consumption as a side effect of the ‚Äútariffs‚Äù that my litter imposed on me such as 1 cup a day. I started realizing I felt so much better, my sleeping quality improved drastically, my anxiety, depression, and mental issues began to dwindle. Honestly, my mental health improved dramatically and in specific, I would no longer go crazy from anxiety and depression.

My irritability also went down. I started making a conscious effort not drink caffeine. I quit tea all together. Never was a soda drinker so that was never a problem. I started reducing the sugar and creamer in my coffee. This is some major advice. By doing this, it‚Äôll force you to taste the bitterness and force you to drink slower. Also, I have learned to prefer it over time as it means I can actually enjoy the coffee rather than the blinding taste of the creamer and sugar.

So I want everyone to know that you can do it. Not just caffeine addiction but any addiction. Please ask any questions and I can give you  advice. If you are young like me, I would love to give some personal advice as I went through this as a teenager. 

Thank you for listening, good luck, I don‚Äôt know you but I am proud you‚Äôre making a conscious effort to change.",5

I just need some advice on dealing with codeine and meprobamate withdrawal.

I've been clean for 43 days. I don't miss the feeling it gave me but I used to drink approximately 400mg of codeine and 4500mg of meprobamate daily for the past 10 years.

So the issue is, I feel snappy and I don't have patience and I just get so angry. 

Is there anyone out there who felt this way and how long did it take to feel normal again?

Or maybe it's just me and this is the new normal cause I can't remember how I felt 10 years ago before I started drinking the pills.",2

It's weird...the first time I quit everything -it was easy. I still had a brain cell or two light up. Now I'm dissociating, hallucinating... My pdoc told me hes basically just waiting for me to ""wake up"" and stop fking with my brain. I'm prone to psychosis (Schizophrenia is my diagnosis, but the doctor said there is a slight chance I'll make a full recovery from ""insanity"" if I stop doing bs).

Does anyone have any advice? I think it honestly may be too late for me. I'm only 23, but the amounts I do... I no doubt will have this catch up with me/may never make a full recovery.. I turned into a monster, which is weird because most substances make me isolate and obsess over something for a few hours.....you know which one I'm talking about. There's basically nobody in my life left...

I could go to detox (detox/safe use site/homeless shelter nearby) in the morning. I could probably get into rehab pretty quick, maybe even direct entry. I love Canada, free health care ftw...but the problem with me has always been that I can't admit I have a very serious substance use problem long enough to still be interested in whatever program calls me weeks/months later... I probably robotripped two hundred times.... drugs aren't even drugs at this point, they just turn off reality a little more. What's the point in that?

2020-08-22 04:27:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ieex5m/how_video_game_addiction_affected_my_life/,How video game addiction affected my life,"I've had a bad relationship with video games for awhile now. I've let it ruin friendships, mental health, physical health, jobs, and now nearly my relationship with the woman of my dreams, my high school sweetheart, who deserves better from me. 

I've been playing video games since a young age, starting with a ps1 and n64 in the basement of my parents house, playing Tony Hawk, Golden Eye, or the occasional Pokemon game. Ever since then I've been enamored with the virtual escape that turning on a video game gives you. I've owned ps1, 2, 3, 4, xbox, xbox 360, xbox 1, super Nintendo, n64, Wii, WiiU, Switch, DS, you name it and I've played it. I use to show pride in how much I've played and my experience, but looking back I see how much of a problem it has become. I let it affect my education as well, all day at school I would day dream about going home to play video games for 6 hours straight and ignore my homework. I would call out of my part time grocery store job so I could stay online playing Call of Duty or Minecraft. After high school, I was gifted a laptop for graduation, and I was to use it for school, since I decided to go to a community college. Getting that laptop was great at the time, but I see now, that was the start of my bad addiction to PC gaming. 

I got recommended a game, League of Legends, by a friend to play with them. I instantly fell in love with that game, and PC gaming in general. To the point where I would skip college classes to play this game, or delete college papers/documents to make room for another update or game on my laptop. I abused that laptop with video games so much, that it literally melted the plastic on the bottom from it overheating. It eventually broke because of the constant use and running it at full power for hours on end without a break. This whole time my college grades were going down and down because of my neglect and ignorance towards my education. This is the part i regret the most, I drop out and stop my education advancing. I was never a straight A student in school, but I was the only one in my immediate family to graduate on time and go to college and my family was super proud of me for it, and frankly I was proud of me too. But I let something as dumb as a video game ruin it for me and ruin my future. 

The other thing I had going on in my life at the time was my high school sweetheart, NT. She's incredible. I met her in 9th grade on the bus and since the moment I laid eyes on her I knew I would do anything to be with her. We were friends throughout high school, until finally in my senior year, we ran into each other at a party and reconnected and became closer than ever. I finally saw my dream of being with NT coming true. Finally on March 1st . 2014, me and NT shared out first kiss and our relationship sprouted. At this time I didn't see me video games as an addiction yet and I never in a million years could imagine that I would let video games come between me and my dream girl. Once I started college, so did she, but she was nearly an hour away at a university. I knew this was going to happen, so the summer after high school I did everything I could to save up for a crappy car so I could visit her whenever I wanted to. She is the smartest person I know and I know she was thriving in school, I couldn't let her know I was struggling with the beginning of my addiction. I saw myself as a nerd, or a loser for letting video games control my life, but I had to put on a front for her. I had to appear like I wasn't addicted to video games and I was doing well in school, but eventually I was exposed. 

After my college life was over, because of me dropping out, I got a full time job as a line cook. I never worked in a kitchen before this and I was worried I wouldn't thrive in this field. There were weeks I struggled and almost got fired because of my inexperience, and there were weeks where I learned a lot and felt confident in a new skill. The downside of this job was, since I lived with my parents, I had spending money. Spending money that I used on my addiction. My very first paycheck I went straight to Gamestop and bought a new XBOX with it. I didn't need it, I still had my Playstation, and my laptop to feed my addiction, but I couldn't help myself. Eventually, I started working the closing shift, which was 5pm-2am. I wouldn't get home until almost 3 every night. I would stay up until 9am, playing video games, waking up my parents throughout the night with my yelling at the screen. Looking back, I see how pathetic it was. Luckily for NT, she was thriving in college and never saw this side of me. 

Eventually I moved out, to an apartment with NT near her school so I could be closer to her. Nothing was more important to me than her and her education. I wouldn't let her work so she could focus on school. I drove an hour and half every day to and from work. I did everything in my power to provide for us, and our relationship couldn't have been better. Then I messed up. I made enough money to splurge on computer parts, and I decided to build my first PC to revisit my addiction all over. If I could go back in time and destroy that first computer, I would. I was so happy to have this computer, one that I built, a one of a kind. I would rush home to play, stay up late to play, call out to play. All of this without realizing what I was doing to my relationship. 

Over the next couple years, this same process was happening. From that apartment, to a house with roommates, to our own apartment. All while building a better and better computer and relationship with my computer, and a worse and worse relationship with my partner. All of this without me noticing because I was addicted and didn't see my own problems. I would skip parties, get togethers, kick backs, whatever the social occasion was, so I could stay home and play video games. In my eyes, I was having the time of my life, building a nice desk, getting better parts for my computer, buying new games, it was awesome to me. But every day I was digging a deeper hole in my relationship, not even realizing the hole was there and we needed a way out. 

We are both blessed with good jobs, and good family, and our perfect dog. Last year we moved to a house together with 3 bedrooms, and one was going to be my office. This was a dream for me, I built a huge desk with 3 monitors and my top of the line PC and I thought it was the greatest thing ever. I would spend hours a day gaming with friends online, staying up until 3 am, being loud. I abused my addiction to the point where my relationship with my high school sweetheart, felt like another roommate. We stopped going on dates, stopped cooking and eating together, stopped watching movies together, stopped it all, and it was all my fault. Every frustration she showed towards me to stop playing games went in one ear and out the other, because I couldn't see myself as addicted to this because it wasn't physically harmful like a drug or alcohol addiction. I am admitting I am 100% in the wrong for my past and actions that lead to this. I've tried to make promises to stop playing and have lashed out and tore apart my setup, but I can never stay away and stray back into playing 12 hours straight, and neglecting my relationship and ignoring the problems I am causing. 

For some insane reason, last December, I saw myself as worthy of getting on one knee and asking this angel to marry me and be with me forever. I know she could see past my addiction and knew I could beat it to show her the unconditional love she deserves, so she said yes. The first couple weeks of our engagement were great, showing off to everyone, going out more, being more passionate, all of the above. All until I messes up again, and got back into my groove of work, sleep, game. I couldn't stay away, not even to save my relationship. She's been my rock for years and she doesn't deserve the pain I'm putting her through. 

The past couple months have been worse than ever, because of quarantine I have more time than ever to sit at home and play video games for hours on end, day after day. It lead to many fights and tore us apart more and more, all because I chose a video game over spending time with her. She's 100% in her rights to be upset about this, and I won't blame her for her frustrations anymore. I cant be mad and defensive when she tells me shes done with me because of how I've treated her the past 5 years. I still struggle with this, I watch videos all day about video games when I'm not playing. I stay until 3am playing still. I come straight home from work and get on my computer still. I do not know how to find that balance. I am worried my days are numbered with my fiance, until she reaches her breaking point, and there's no one to blame but myself. I'm scared I'll never see her walk down the aisle, or have a family, all because I do not know how to walk away from a virtual world. 

I do not want any sympathy, I have done this to myself and I can not escape it. I struggle everyday even waking up to go to work and not just stay home and press the power button on my computer. I tore my setup down again tonight, hoping it'll keep me away from it. At least long enough to appreciate my partner again and find that spark again. Long enough to find a balance between my personal time playing video games, and my intimate time spent together with my fiance. I can't live , with myself knowing what I've done to my love. I'm scared I'm not strong enough to stay away, but I know I would do anything for NT. I have to do this for mine and her future. I never saw myself as having an addictive personality, I don't smoke cigarettes or drink much, so I thought me playing video games was safe from addiction, but I was very wrong. I see how much this has ruined my life so far and I can't let it continue ruining my future.

He still describes himself as a caffeine addict but doesn't appear to have any intention of cutting the substance altogether at any point and definitely goes through some kind of withdrawals if he doesn't have any caffeine for a few hours.

I don't consume any caffeine so the concept of caffeine dependency in general has always been something I've been vaguely aware of from people who claim they can't do xyz without a coffee in the morning, but not something I have any first hand experience with.

I don't know how to help him or how I'm supposed to interact with his caffeine habits, or at what point it becomes a concern. I know that he's not at the levels he was before when he himself acknowledged it was a serious problem, but I'm not sure what to be looking out for regarding it potentially being an actual problem now, and I'm not sure what the best way to support him is, especially if I don't really understand it.

Can anyone talk me through it a bit to help me understand it better?",1

But I always bounced back ok, and would return to normalish functioning after a couple weeks. But at the end of March I had a little bender and it fucked me up. 

Started with a night of adderall and alcohol. And on my last line of adderall i almost passed out. My ears rang, my vision flashed white, and I felt backwards and hit the wall. I shook it off and jumped back in the mosh pit (stupid) and felt like I would pass out the entire time. But ended up being ok. 

It took a couple days to recover from that then I was back at it and blacked out out kpins and alcohol. Got up the next day, ate some kratom then did meth all day. I tested my shit, got a couple questionable results but trucked on. I was fine through all this, or as fine as one can be on a meth binge. Then came the last line, the last line I tested was bad, no question about it. The result could indicate a few things, but I‚Äôve just assumed fent since fent in meth is a problem here. Anyways, I did that line and I knew I fucked up. I don‚Äôt even know how to describe the feeling accurately. It just felt like I was ripped out of my body, and I genuinely thought I was going to die. I stumbled backwards, lost all train of thought, my heart rate slowed which was terrifying in contrast to how hard it had been pounding all day from the meth. I felt like I wanted to sleep, but also felt like I shouldn‚Äôt. So I sat on the couch, and then it was suddenly morning. And I just havn‚Äôt been the same since. 


The worst of the fog lifted after a couple weeks, but for a little bit I i was struggling with the most basic shit. I couldn‚Äôt spell, I couldn‚Äôt do simple math, I couldn‚Äôt remember anything. But some of that fog still remains 5 months later. I don‚Äôt function like I used to, I‚Äôm slower all around. I can‚Äôt make art like I used to. I don‚Äôt remember a lot of shit. Like I asked my step sister when she got a new cat, but had apparently met the cat a few times and had played with it a lot . I asked a friend when he got new glasses, but he had had them for years. I have lots of moments like this, and can‚Äôt remeber a lot of shit. Aside from functioning I‚Äôm just different. Like, a lot of my random fears and anxieties are gone. One example is I use to have major car anxiety, but have 0 fear of being in a car now and have been practicing driving. And all my random anxieties like that are gone. I have 0 anxiety running around urban exploring and shit like that that‚Äôd normally come with a sense of being creeped out. And I feel like my personality is different too .


I regret that last run so much, I feel like a husk of what I used to be. I‚Äôd probably be back to normal, or closer to it now if it weren‚Äôt for that. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never fully bounce back and that I gave myself fucking brain damage or some shit.",21

Though  I know it's only a mental issue, the pain of spending copious amounts  of money on a substance that makes me hate myself is just horrible. The  Mania, the depression, the anxiety. The sheer nonsense I tell myself to  justify it... I can't do it anymore. I'm not a suicidal person, but I  can't take it anymore. I've lost most friends, crews, girlfriends and  sanity than I ever have. While my mental state is feeling strong, my  social state is non-existant. I can't stand those who I currently call  ""friends"" and those who I want to be seen, is so far past giving me a  chance... I can't even use any other substances to have fun and meet new  people. Because I truly want more for myself. Yet, I'll waste so much  money on bullshit substances... I want to get help, but I don't know how  to help myself. I need advice. From anyone. Please... Please...

I  have a strong family bond, currently at University again. I don't enjoy  taking random shit anymore, the nitrous was my only enjoyment. But even  saying that out loud is so stupid. Yeah, if I had more money, then I  could do more for myself. I could continue to do what I do. But the  fucking lack of what I once had... I can't stand it... I find it so hard  to want to go out, I find it hard to want to put effort into girls. Guy  friends are so hard to hold onto. I really want to be more. I really  want to elevate, but it's so difficult without the people who made me  who I was. Dozens of life long friends, now seem like a distant memory.

Please,  this is such a desperate call for help. I really need advice from  someone who has experienced similar shit to this, or even someone who  may have overcome it...

I promise I will not hurt myself. I just really need advice... Thank you",18

I have a friend struggling with addiction. He has relapsed a few times before. He has had methadone and suboxone treatments but doesn't last very long. His mom called me yesterday to know if there is a neuropsychologist in the town that her son can go to.
Apparently neuropsychology helps with addiction and works better than rehab. I am not sure of this approach.

So basically I miss my hole junior year cuz the frist couple months I was skipping all the time going out on school nights and getting totally wrecked. Than I got put in a 28 day rehab when I got out this hole quarantine thing started. So school was online. I can barely get myself to go to school sometimes and even when I'm there doing the work and paying attention in class is very hard. 
So being stuck at home in my room there was no way I was going to sit on my computer for 4 hours a day. Especially when I had a big bag of weed sitting right next to me and people hitting me up to go get fucked up. So anyways I got into this job corps program where I do 4 months of school and learn a trade and get my GED. The only downside is I have to go to an IOP where I get drug tested. This means no more weed or pills I can still do mushroom acid and dxm And I can only drink on Thursdays. I'm really scared I need this and I don't want to fuck it up but I just don't know how I'm going to be able to get through four months without smoking weed. I use weed to cope with my family situation sleep insomnia depression and anxiety. And I feel like if I go out and get drunk or take acid I'm going to end up hitting someone's blunt or some shit and destroy my life for the 900th time.",3

He had been sober prior for about 20 days. The place is super sketchy to me and has rules/requirements that none of the other 4 places we have tried had. 

First, they didn't let me go with him... they had me drop him off to someone in a shopping plaza. We had discussed doing a 5-7 day detox and then transferring to a recovery facility. It's been 12 days and I have had very little contact with anyone to know what is going on. Now they say that his 14 days of detox are almost up and he has to transfer to their recovery center or stay there for another 10 days. They said that they can legally hold his personal belongings (including his phone and wallet) for 72 hours afterward if he wants walk out the front door into a high crime neighborhood (someone was murdered on the street a few blocks down last week) with no way of contacting me to come take him to safety or a different facility. 

They finally let me talk to him for the first time yesterday and he contradicted everything that staff had told me, saying none of that was true and that he was being coerced to say certain things before the call dropped suddenly.

I am feeling like it is time to get clean, but can't help but have a shitty mentality thinking that I have already damaged my brain/heart to the point that it will never return to it's state before drugs/alcohol.

I am not as heavy of a user as many, but still cannot stop stressing over this.

For reference, I've been using coke for a few years sparingly at time (1-2 times a month) and a bit more frequently the past 6 months (4-6 times a month). At least a gram each time. Also have been a daily drinker for years, also a bit heavier in the last 6 months. I've also experimented with other drugs, mostly MDMA (which was also more frequent in the past 6 months). As you can probably tell, the last 6 months were kinda shit lol. Lots of escaping.

I tried researching to see if there were any studies done showing that the damage of drug use was reversed through nutrition and exercise (& abstaining from drugs) but couldn't find anything. This left me feeling extremely guilty and worried for the future. 

Hoping you guys can provide some sort of insight of your body repairing itself physically after years of abuse.",1

2020-08-20 04:49:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/id6oef/helping_a_friend/,Helping a friend,"Sorry in advance if similar topics have been posted about this before.

I (gay M28) recently found out that a good friend (gay M30) of mine is struggling with a meth addiction. It surprised me, but not because he had used it before, but because he was struggling with this problem. Meth, also known as T in the gay community, is a pretty common party drug so its not surprising to me that he's tried it, but he was so against others using it I would not have known that he was addicted. 

When he told me, he made me not tell anyone, but looking around at reddit and google, and I think for most people that the first step to recovering from an addiction is acknowledging the problem (which I guess is a start seeing that he confided in me). Of course I'm not going to air his dirty laundry but I haven't been able to stop thinking about this because I care deeply about this person. (Not being able to talk about what's been on my mind has been eating away at me/stressing me too - I think about him and this at least a little bit every day so far but it's only been about a week) Maybe he thought he could handle the addiction on his own in the past? I don't know how large his support group for this is.

He used to be able to reach out to his ex if he felt the urge to partake again but he had just been broken up by his ex a few months ago. Unfortunately, he had relapsed again a few weeks ago (after who knows how long, I didn't think of asking at the time) probably just shortly after the break up. He said he would reach out to me now if he had issues again and I told him that he could contact me anytime - I even changed his contact to hard bypass Do Not Disturb or Silent mode. 

Given all this information, I don't know what else I can do without being ""overbearing"" or like a nagging parent but I just want to make sure he is okay. I don't want to push him away or have him hide things from me, but I feel so helpless knowing what I know now. **It also doesn't help that I've had a crush on him**, even while he was with his ex (obviously I did not act on it then). I'm very open-minded so this doesn't scare me, but I also don't know how deeply his addiction affects him. I **don't** think he is ready to date right now though, for a number of reasons maybe.

If this was you, what would you do or if you could go back, is there something you wish a friend had done?",1

UK) my boyfriend and I would get fucked up every so
often on weekends, drinking + coke, sometimes ketamine too. We would have zoom quizzes or drag bingo and get drunk and then order in some coke. Aside from this we had with a great routine to keep occupied during the week (i was doing daily yoga, topping up my Spanish). 

He goes to bed super early on weeknights so I would just stay up and watch drag race and do a couple of lines of k, but still getting up in the morning. I would be constantly redditing and googling how it would affect me, but then sort of just thought, if I was having a couple of glasses of wine and doing the same thing it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue? Alcohol ruins your brain too but it‚Äôs just part of life. I wasn‚Äôt getting fucked up, just a little wave then went to sleep.

But now as soon as I have a drink, or even if i‚Äôm alone when my bf is out, i just need *something* whether some k, some coke, a tiny bit of xan, anything. Just to get a buzz. I would still be sensible though, limiting myself depending on what i had to do the next day (I started volunteering 5 days a week), but I began to lie to my boyfriend about when i was doing it. We had a couple of arguments, I attended an online NA meeting but cried the whole time because some of their stories were heartbreaking and I wasn‚Äôt as much of a struggling addict as some of the people sharing stories and they were really in bad places (it was a reality check though of course) but I also felt out of place because it turned to god and I‚Äôm an atheist so I felt bad for being there. As well as the fact these people were real struggling AM-PM addicts and i felt like a coaster. So much guilt for pitying myself when real people are really struggling.

I‚Äôm a fucking vegan and the other night I got a fucking cheeseburger just to feel some kind of buzz. What is this shit?? I even sniffed some really old MDMA because i know my medication won‚Äôt make me feel anything, it was literally just to feel it in my nose????

I‚Äôm itching for anything as soon as I have a drink or am alone or.. i don‚Äôt even know! Any time if I had the chance. I think it‚Äôs lack of stimulation because I hadn‚Äôt been working for months, as well as having nothing to get up for (really), and the fact it was the two of us as the start, but now it‚Äôs just whenever i can the thought pops into my head. No specific drug or anything.

I‚Äôm back at work part time now and am generally
good at getting up in the mornings anyway, but I‚Äôm just so confused about what this itch is. I just want any sort of buzz. Any time!! I used to never be like this. I even took up smoking just to feel *something* even tho it makes me feel like shit and I smoke cigs in thirds because I can‚Äôt handle the rush. Wtf is that??? I‚Äôm not going to pick up right now or anything but I know I‚Äôm going out on friday and am already planning to get some coke and get fucked up. Why?

2020-08-17 13:11:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ibi8ak/quick_story_3_years_clean/,"Quick story, 3 years clean","*(I typed all this out in response to a month old comment and thought I'd share as a post as well.)*

>For speed (meth), honestly safe use is next to impossible. Those that pull it off do not go on benders/skip sleep, keep their doses low, and don't smoke/inject it. It can be done, but people rarely succeed.

Kind of pointless to reply in a month old thread, but I will anyway.

When I started meth a few years ago I started by putting a few pts into capsules and using it like Adderall. Very stupid, but at the time I had ready access to high quality stuff through someone at work who knew a legendary cook, and it was far cheaper ($10 or $20/g? don't remember) than the Addys I had been using. I thought for sure that I would be able to use these capsules in place of Addys without any problems.

Curiosity got the better of me after a few months and after reading about smoking it and wanting to see how it felt, and see the crackback and all of that, I bought a glass dick and tried it.

Cue 6 months of gradual increase, weekend edging benders and skipping sleep, and I got to a point where I was taking multiple capsules a day at work to keep the edge off and sneaking into the bathroom at times to smoke it(!) ""So I can get a bunch of work done"" I justified it as. I was only doing about a gram or two a week by the end of it, so it wasn't extreme, but it took getting fired from that job (for coming in an hr or two late multiple times after a weekend bender) and walking away from everyone I knew there (an inlaw uncle's family business)

By the end I was getting nothing from it because I refused to buy more than two grams/wk and only felt ""normal"" on it and like shit coming down. I'm so glad I didn't go any further down the rabbit-hole chasing the high because it only spirals from there.

I did this all on my own, never smoked with anyone else, only my dealer knew I was using and my family didn't find out until I discussed it with them 2 years later. It was a lonely time (immediate family, single, no kids here)

I know my usage was relatively low compared to how extreme it can get, so I find it interesting how even a ""mild"" addiction to it can be so difficult to deal with.

He was given opioids to assist in his recovery. We used to be close when we were young when we lived together, but our family (my mother, brother, myself, and grandmother) moved out. Skip to high school - my cousin and I were still close and used to cut class to smoke pot and play video games. After he graduated (he‚Äôs 2 years older), I got in trouble for skipping so much school and straightened up. We drifted after that and he ended up dropping out of college fairly quickly. A little later, he got into the accident mentioned above. 

It‚Äôs been a spiral since then. He was and still is always talking about how his back hurts and how the pain won‚Äôt go away. He was high at my grandma‚Äôs funeral in 2012, and while we were in her home country to bury her, he was buying OTC opioids he couldn‚Äôt easily obtain in America. I moved to teach abroad in 2016 and came back last year because my brother suddenly died in an accident. He was high at my brother‚Äôs funeral, though he witnessed my mother‚Äôs devastation firsthand. I was amazed at how bad his addiction had gotten. He always calls my mother (usually her) or me to borrow or ask for money - sometimes very specific amounts.

His dad was very emotional abusive (emotionally, physically to me), which is why we moved out. His parents‚Äô marriage fell apart and he and his mother only recently moved into an apartment after selling the house. He‚Äôs never been able to keep a job for long, claiming that his back hurts or he needs to see his doctor. His dad tried to line up jobs for him, but he lost them all, and my mother recently got him a job, which I think he lost but is afraid to admit it in fear of disappointing his mother. In an attempt to hold him accountable, she put him in charge of paying the utilities, but just last week, he called my mother asking for money. 

Recently, he‚Äôs made a new friend who is much older than him. The guy came over yesterday to set something up and just the look of him gave me bad vibes. His mother doesn‚Äôt seem to want to acknowledge that he has a drug addiction. She has threatened to kick him out if he doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúget it together‚Äù. She tells my mother and I to talk to him because she said she‚Äôs talked to him and nothing has helped.

Today was his birthday, but it was also my brother‚Äôs 1 year death anniversary, so we held a prayer ceremony. He dropped a family friend to our house and disappeared for several hours. He finally came back at night and was high out of his mind. His mouth was open and his eyes were rolling. He was swaying while seated and dropping his food on the floor. He even lied on the floor. When I tried to shake him awake, he wasn‚Äôt responsive for a few seconds, even though his eyes and mouth were open. I eventually took him home because his mother wanted to stay at our house longer.

On the drive back, I asked him what he had taken that day. He told me hadn‚Äôt taken anything and asked me if I could imagine the pain. He talked about prescription drugs and the doses he would have to take just to find relief. When I finally reached his apartment, he started crying and told me that I just saw him as a druggie like his dad. I told him I didn‚Äôt. He said maybe if he died, his mom would get some money from his life insurance and wouldn‚Äôt have to worry for a little while. I was shocked and asked him why he would say that after he saw the devastation of my mother. I told him that he should seek rehab but he said he hadn‚Äôt taken anything in 3 weeks, only injections for his back which weren‚Äôt helping him, along with a pain reliever that‚Äôs supposed to help his nerves. He complains that he can‚Äôt sleep and wakes up every 30 mins. I told him I‚Äôd always be there to talk if he had suicidal thoughts, but I really didn‚Äôt know what to say to him besides seek rehab. Every time he asked me if I could imagine his pain, I told him I couldn‚Äôt.

I get the sense that he feels like a failure to his mother and doesn‚Äôt know what he can do to help himself or keep a job. She‚Äôs been especially impatient and annoyed at him recently.

After I dropped him off, his mother asked me if I talked to him. I told her that he really needed to get help, really needed to seek rehab. His mother said that he says that he‚Äôd kill himself and she told me she tells him ‚Äúthen why don‚Äôt you do it?‚Äù I repeated over and over to her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell him that‚Äù... I told her again that he needs to go to rehab and she said that she needed to have a serious talk with him, but she still seems convinced that he has back pain (she is a dialysis nurse). I told her I‚Äôd be there to support her and help him talk to him about rehab. I don‚Äôt know how serious she is about it. She seems to be isolating herself more and is giving up on him. Idk

I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here. Everyone noticed he was high today, but no one said anything until I dropped him home.

What do I do? I don‚Äôt want his mother to go through the pain of losing her child the way my mother is. It‚Äôs too much.

tldr; Cousin got into a bike accident 10 yrs ago and has been addicted to opioids ever since (and possibly other drugs). Reached a turning point today where he was swaying, his eyes were rolling back, and he was lying on the floor. His mom seems in denial but she seems to be into the idea of having him go to rehab due to his pain med addiction. Idk where to go from here.",1

I wish it wasn't me who was writing this.  I really wish it wasn't.  I wish I wasn't handpicked because I have one of the ""best handles"" on this subject.  I wish I wasn't ""qualified"" to speak on the heroin epidemic that is a growing problem nationwide.  I wish I wasn't a member of a community no one really wants to be a part of.  No one ever says to themselves while reading stuff like mine, ""I wish I could relate to this.""

But I am.  I am the non-addict who knows all too well what it's like to have an addict in the family.

I know what it's like to worry yourself sick.  To cry yourself to sleep.  To stare at baby pictures & reminisce.  To check on them while they sleep to make sure they are still breathing.

I know to watch out for pinhole pupils and subtle changes in behavior.  To listen to them talk and make excuses and pile on lie after lie.  I know what it's like to pretend to believe them because you are just too mentally exhausted for an argument when you know they are lying straight to your face.

I know what it's like to be confused all the damn time; to see their potential, to know what they are throwing away.

I know what it's like to want their recovery more than they do.  To be the one doing research on rehabs and other outlets for recovery.

I know what it's like to miss someone who is still standing right in front of you.

I know what it's like to wonder if each unexpected phone call is ""the"" phone call.  I know what it's like to be hurt so bad and be made so sick that part of you wishes you would just get ""the"" phone call if nothing is going to change.  You want that finality.  You need the cycle to end.  I know what it's like to hate yourself for even allowing yourself to find relief in that horrible thought.

I know what it's like to get the worst news of your life, and still walk into the grocery store and run your errands and smile at the cashier.

I know what it's like to become a part-time detective.  To snoop through drawers and texts.  You know you are going to find something, and you look until you do just so you feel less crazy.  So you can say to yourself, ""I am not paranoid.  This is happening again.""

I know what it's like to have your mind clouded; to turn into a functioning zombie.  I know what it's like to be physically present at board meetings and dinner dates, but mentally gone.

I know what it's like to stop caring about your own personal and professional life.  My relationship took a backseat, Christ not even the backseat - I kicked him out of the car.  I would show up to work not showered and with huge bags under my eyes.  I would cry at my desk.

Everything the outside world expected of me seemed frivolous if I couldn't keep one of my most important people in my life out of harm's way.

I know what it's like to be really pissed off.  Like, REALLY pissed the hell off.  Between the sadness there is a lot of anger.  I know what it's like to feel guilty for being so mad, even knowing all you know about addiction.  You are allowed to be angry.  This is not the life you signed up for.

I know what it's like to scour a bookshelf and not find what you are looking for because this illness is still so hard to talk about, let alone right write about.

I know what it's like to hear someone argue that addiction is not an illness, that it is a choice.  I know all too well that feeling of heat rising in your face as they go on and on about something they know nothing about.

I know what it's like to stop becoming angry with these people.  They do not understand.  They are lucky to not understand.  I know what it is like to catch yourself wishing that you didn't understand either.

I know the difference between enabling and empowering.  I know there is a fine line between the two and the difference can mean life or death.  I know what it's like to the feel the weight of each day on your shoulders trying to balance the two.

I have been through enough to know that things don't just change for the worse overnight; they can change in a millisecond.  In a blink of an eye.  As quick as it takes two people to make a $10 exchange.

I know what it's like to feel stigmatized.  To be the ""sister of a drug addict,"" a ""friend of a drug addict,"" ""the daughter of a drug addict.""  I know what it feels like to be handled with kid-gloves because no one outside of your toxic bubble knows what to say to help.

I don't know what the future holds for anyone who loves an addict today.  One thing I know for sure is I am not alone.

I've been smoking weed since i was 16, regular daily use started at 20 and i'm now 32. I had my first joint at the age of 15 that was handed to me by my dad and at the age of between 7-10 i was standing in my dad's attack surrounded by skunk plants. Considering that i'd say i never had a chance of not smoking it but as an adult i can't blame my parents for the continued use. It's been in my life and system for half of my life and that makes me really uncomfortable with myself.


Since lockdown i noticed how much of it i smoked and actually was ashamed of the money i'd spent on it. Half ounces to go along with all the games i was buying just for something to do as i was between jobs when lockdown came. I will say that while i was on it i became a pro chef and have been since 18 and got qualified too. Doing a long shift then coming home to smoke and play games was my life for so long and i struggle with confidence which i feel the weed only magnified.¬†


I'm now on day 8 and the headaches and night sweats are here. Feels like my brain is in a vice and so many thoughts just rushing around as my brain gets back to normal functionality and i wake up absolutely drenched in sweat and when it dries it stinks of weed. My dreams are really vivid and rather unpleasant as through smoking weed i never used to dream as while you are high you don't get rem (rapid eye movement) sleep and weed inhibits the part of your brain that allows you to dream but i wake up feeling exhausted and like i haven't slept. I guess thats because my body is flushing the toxins out and my brain sorting itself out meaning i'm not actually getting rest as the body and mind have more to process as i sleep


When people say ""oh it's just a joint"" and ""it's not addictive"" i can tell you thats is pure bullshit. Anything you enjoy doing can become addictive and as far as coming off it it's by far the hardest drug to come off. I've read so many reddit posts and personal accounts online from people who use and were addicted to multiple drugs and they all say the same thing. Weed is the hardest one to come off. Naturally it stays in the system for a month but prolonged use can take up to 3 months to fully clear out of the system. Considering that i can honestly say i don't know what it's like to not have it in my system and i am under no illusions that i have a long and hard road ahead of me.


Handling my emotions and learning to cope without it will be the battle of my lifetime. I grew up without a mother as she was raped by her own brother at the age of 13, kept it to herself then at the age of 17 went into an abusive and toxic relationship with my dad. After having her 3rd child at the age of 24 my mum had a massive mental breakdown leading her to be sectioned and taken away from me at the age of 4. Didn't properly connect with her till i was 28 and due to the years in a psychiatric ward with all the medication she is a shade of her former self but i'm so proud of her for even getting well enough to be able to live independently as alot of people don't make it out of those places and are just gone


My dad was abusive to me as a kid. A slap to the face was a regular thing as a kid. For normal things that kids do like draw on walls. He had broken my nose twice before the age of 17 just through laying his fists into me when he was drunk, coked up or in a bad mood through not having his addictive substances. I was 26 before i stood up to him and hit him back and 28 when i stood up to him verbally.¬†


Point being is i'm worried and scared about how i will process all this emotionally and mentally once i start to get back to normal fuctionality. Certainly going to be sitting there in floods of tears as weed has been a coping mechanism for as long as i can remember


I'm already starting to see some upsides after only 8 days though. Speed of thought and my mind is becoming clearer by the day. I may even start to find some confidence and self esteem somewhere along the way.


Any support would be much appreciated. I know i can do this, i know what to expect and i know it will certainly be worth it


Thank you for listening",6

I have a big problem here, which is not about me but about my mother.  
From around 1 month, It seems she's becoming addicted to alcohol.  
I discovered this one day when I got back from work: I've found her in terrible conditions, leaning against the wall. She had troubles talking and she had no intentions to explain me what was going on, despite my various invitations to tell me.

Then I've luckily found his partner outside, he was cutting the grass. I've asked him why my mother was in so terrible conditions and he told me that, from around 1 month, she started to drink more and more. That surprised me a little because I haven't expected this from her, I just remember that something like this happened around 15 years ago but never more.

Today the same situation: We was at the dinner, everything seemed to be OK, she was happy and perfectly lucid.  
After around 1 hour she started to drink around 2 beers (for what I've seen) and she COMPLETELY changed, It really seemed that she turned into another person: Very sad, troubles to speak, confused state, etc...  
After the dinner, when everyone went away, she closed herself in the kitchen with all lights off, her phone in her hands, constantly looking out of the window.  
I came in the kitchen too because I needed to fill my bottle of water from the fridge and that's why I've found her, but she wanted to tell me nothing.   
This time I really got angry, I told her that It's not possible that I see her in this conditions and I can't stand this anymore. Nothing, It has been a failed attempt because she only told that ""not everything is right"".  


Honestly the fact that she never wants to talk me about this problem is making me angry, but I don't know exactly what to do. Today I was so angry that I though to leave home and go to sleep somewhere else. And I am almost sure that tomorrow she'll be as normal as before, like nothing happened. I've known this problem only thanks to his partner, she really told me nothing for now.

Some suggestions to help her? Have you ever found in a similar situation?

Thanks a lot in advance :)",1

I‚Äôm already crying writing this & so nervous. I got out of rehab a few months ago & have been doing alright. My addictions stem from abuse / trauma when I was younger & there‚Äôs a lot of addictions outside of the more obvious DoC that I didn‚Äôt know I had (shopping, stealing, self harm, etc) that I‚Äôm incredibly ashamed of. 

I‚Äôm on a road trip & am going through withdrawals from an SSRI. I‚Äôve been throwing up, dizzy, passes out & shivering for the last few days. Yesterday, a women came up to me recording & said I shoplifted from her store & she has it on camera. I was genuinely supeised & confused. I had bought something for $100 at her store. I looked in my bag & there was a $25 ring in there. I don‚Äôt remember doing it, but I know I must have. Long story short, I got busted. I‚Äôve never felt so ashamed in my life & disgusted with myself‚Äî More than anytime I‚Äôve used, attempted, anything else. My brother was there & saw everything. I went back to the shop to try to talk to the woman, which didn‚Äôt go too well. She was on another level‚Äî which is understandable. 

I guess my question is how do you work through the shame of relapsing (not sure if anyone has a history of taking things)? I know it sounds like a lie, but I don‚Äôt even want to. Whenever it‚Äôs happened in the past, it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm doing it until I get home. 

I‚Äôm currently fighting like hell not to use to numb this shame & dark thoughts are really coming back strong. I know I need to get back on my meds, but I can‚Äôt sleep from the guilt, shame & disgust I feel. And I wonder if it‚Äôs because other people know I‚Äôm not well now. 

Any response would be appreciated. I feel super alone & disgusted in myself. Thanks",5

theres lights here. a cool led strip, it reacts to music. and ive been great since i quit but right now under this light strip, with music playing, all i can think about is how much i miss them all. im only 19. why do i have to be done experimenting? fuck. 

these guys are the only friends i have anymore. they dont fuck with anything but alcohol, i already dropped the rest of my bad influence friends. i cant leave these guys. theyre all i have. 

but fucking fuck fuck fuck ive tied myself into this stressful mindset out of no where. 

context, i quit a week ago. had a bad dxm binge and told my parents everything on the backside of it. 

its felt easy until today. 

ive felt excited until today.  

excited to be productive without smoking everyday

but its building and idk what to do

i dont wanna go back to my parents because ive already fought to keep what freedoms i do have (they wanted to ship me to the military)

i cant sleep anymore. ive been filling my time with making music. 

24 hour days, then little to no sleep on work nights. sleeping till 12 on weekends. 

ive always had insomnia. nothing has ever helped besides weed. melatonin doesnt do shit benadryl doesnt do shit, and i dont trust myself with pills. 

but i also used it as a coping mechanism. i used when bored. antsy. 

but the weed bone is connected to my dxm bone. and my shrooms bone. 

i just hate this. i feel stuck. this past week has been the most stressful week of my life for every reason besides wanting to drugs. 

i thought i was through it. through the hard parts of getting my future figured out. 

i knew this was coming but i didnt wanna think about it

but now im neck deep in this rabbit hole of a mindset, but im still at my friends. 

i dont wanna leave because theyll talk about it with each other and probably to me

its only gonna put more attention on the issue. 

fuck idk. idk. idk. 

if anyone‚Äôs reading can i please hear some encouragement or can someone be just fucking straight with me because I DONT KNOW WHAT I NEED AND YALL DONT EITHER BUT I DONT EVEN KNOW IF DJFJFIEKKDKDKRKE idk

2020-08-15 15:10:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/iadec6/journal_quitting_kratom_phenibut_alcohol/,"Journal: Quitting kratom, phenibut, alcohol, gabapentin, and cigarettes.","Today is day 4 without any kratom. I was at 12 grams a day for about 7 months. Been on kratom off and on for 6 years usually around the 30+ gram range though. This has been one of the better quits I've had by far. I went from 12 grams to 9 grams for about a week, to 6 grams for about 3 days, to 2 grams for about 2 days. Then just jumped completely off 4 days ago. The taper wasn't something I really planned. I kind of just went with it and went based off how I was feeling I guess. I'm not sure if the ease of this quit has been because of the level I was taking this time, the taper itself, albeit a very fast one, or the 2400mg of Gabapentin I'm prescribed daily. Maybe it's a combination of all three.

I've been doing pretty well, outside the metal and emotional fatigue, anxiety, and the liquid bombs it gives you. I've tried intermittent fasting during these past 4 days as well but not sure how well thats worked. If anything its probably only added to the mental strain, anxiety, etc. I'm going back on my normal diet today just to see if it helps that extra bit. 

I also quit cigarettes the day before I quit kratom and switched to vape. Today will also be day one without alcohol which I've slowly tapered. I will say, my cravings for a cigarette and food have vastly outweighed my cravings for kratom. I have taken an extra dose of Gabapentin here and there but nothing too excessive. The max recommended daily dose of Gabapentin is 3600 mg anyways. I have never exceeded that. 

I'm gonna give it some time but I'd like to get off these gabbies as well. They've helped with my anxiety and depression some but if anything they are only doing the same thing kratom and alcohol was all along; Masking the real problems at hand. I'm honestly more terrified of dropping the Gabapentin now. I'll be completed naked, so to speak, after I quit those. That's a scary ass feeling. Plus I've been on them for well over a year, the withdrawls from these will likely be much worse this time at the dose I'm taking. I love these gabbies but at the same time I notice the effect it has on me, like kratom and phenibut did as well. There for a while my daily drug routine was 3 grams phenibut, 12-16 grams kratom, 2400 mg gabapentin, and 6-12 beers a night, while also taking prozac and clonidine. Didn't even dawn on me that I was taking too much shit till a friend scolded me about it. I've been off phenibut and prozac for 2 months now though and have slowly been trying to work on the others as my stress tolerance allows. 

This has been a long and slow moving journey but I think and hope that I'm finally coming to the end of my addiction rope. I've been addicted to something or another for over 15 years. In my teenage years it was alcohol, opiates, methadone, weed, and coke. The last 8 years Ive done more of a risk management approach with these less mainstream drugs but they've cause their own problems in the end. I have the opportunity to go into an inpatient treatment center. I still question whether or not I actually need treatment or if it would be helpful. I had a bad experience when I voluntarily went into a mental hospital 4 years ago, during one of my worst withdrawls from booze and kratom. I should have been in a treatment center then, instead of a mental hospital but for some reason I was convinced I was having a mental breakdown caused by my circumstances and my family pressured me into it. In essence it was a combination of both circumstances and withdrawl but I believe the withdrawl was the main culprit. I'm afraid I'll have a similar bad experience in treatment. Maybe that's just an excuse not to go. Idk. At least this time I'm not being pressured by other people. It would be my own choice. The reality though, is if I don't go, whose to say I won't end up right back in this same spot or worse, with all my effort and intentionto get and stay clean down the drain *yet again*. 

Then again I look at all the people recovering from more serious, life threatening addictions and see, how they went through literal hell to get off these things, some going to treatment because they had no other choice. I see them and think that my struggles have been a cake walk in comparison. Although I was addicted to some harder drugs in my teen years, I never experienced any severe withdrawl from them, atleast none that I ever acknowledged. I feel like if I go to treatment I'll look like a weak fool along side the others who have literally struggled and fought for their lives to get in there to save their lives. So I don't know what to do. It almost feels like I'd be selfish to go in there and act like my struggles are in any way significant or relatable to theirs. I understand we all have our own recovery roads to go down. That some are harder and more extreme than others but even though we've all had our addiction struggles, we can't all relate to each other on the same level all the time. To me I feel like that would become problematic in a recovery environment. Maybe I'm wrong, I've never been to treatment so I have no idea what to even expect but that's how I've been feeling about it. Like I wouldn't belong there if I did go. I already feel like an outcast as it is. I'd rather not feel even more so like one in recovery.",5

When people say ""why don't you just say no?"" they don't understand the nature of addiction. an addict is incapable of saying no. an addict could be sober for years, but the minute the opportunity presents itself, chances are yes is the only word they know. 

I found that out the hard way. and I'm now discovering the consequences of relapsing. feeling suicidal again, feeling worthless, ashamed, angry, disappointed, sick. I feel like screaming until my lungs burst.

About 3 months ago, I moved to a new location away from the few friends I kept. I began using more and more just to pass the time since I was alone most do the time.


About 2 days ago I came to the realization that I was using a little too much and decided to just back off. 

After I started feeling weird, I started googling... word for word the description of withdrawal symptoms matched what I was feeling.

I‚Äôm presently in full panic mode (I‚Äôm a pretty calm person, so I‚Äôm not literally panicking, but of course I‚Äôm extremely worried about my health)

If I come clean at work, my job would be in severe jeopardy, so I cannot count on anyone that works with me. I have no family; unfortunately I‚Äôm the only person left from my immediate family.

I am not a veteran, i am not homeless, but i do have trauma and addiction....and when i watch the music video ""Wrong side of heaven"", it really connects me to the veterans in the video but also really touches my pain in a way that is quite direct and powerful

just watched it again this morning, and as often the case, i sit here crying, today i think it was for the homelessness, sometimes i cry for me, and sometimes for the veterans, and sometimes for all of us

I personally find a strong link between rock / metal music and how it relates to explaining depression, anxiety, addiction and trauma and this video is just another good example of that",1

DPH and dxm has pretty much been my life for 6 months. I‚Äôm going to Florida for two weeks to see my mom and hopefully change some things about myself. I od‚Äôd on a mixture of 1776 mg of dxm (2 bottles of delsym) and an unknown amount of DPH. I was at a point that I just didn‚Äôt care. Luckily my girlfriend has been one step behind and one step ahead of me or I wouldn‚Äôt be making this post today, I would have died in January. I don‚Äôt want to leave the people I love behind and I‚Äôm trying so so hard not to do any DPH or DXM the issue is I just can‚Äôt sleep and I feel the need to fuck myself up until I fall asleep. I don‚Äôt want to die I just hate the situation I‚Äôm in. My job at a ground round was awesome until it burned down in May and I haven‚Äôt been working since then. I feel like a fucking mooch all the time and I get unemployment but I just feel like a mooch. My return to work date is indefinite so if I get another job I lose almost all unemployment benefits. I really hope this two weeks actually means something to me at the end. I‚Äôm so sad and i relapse constantly including tonight. But honestly the dxm is the least of my concerns being that I use dxm only products. I just hate when I get caught tripping it breaks my girlfriends heart and it breaks mine too by i just can‚Äôt stop. Sometimes I feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with my head that I have to escape every night. But I try to convince myself it‚Äôs not tru and it works for a little while and then I just blow up on my gf who is the only person who has gave a single fuck about me for the last year that we‚Äôve been on our own. My own family has turned us away and stolen from us and that‚Äôs resulted in us basically being homeless and I don‚Äôt want that for her. I feel so so sad that this is our life and there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. I just need to vent before my mind collapses. I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I want to go on like this and I know it gets better but sometimes it seems that it never will.

I don‚Äôt necessarily hate my life I just hate where it‚Äôs going and hate my mind and always feel like a burden on the people that help me the most. But things are looking up however.

SO WHY THE FUCK DO I KEEP GOING BACK?

I'm so frustrated. I'm getting married in 6 weeks and all I can think about is how sorry I feel for my fiance for wanting to marry a drug addict. He doesn't feel that way though, he is so supportive and loving and he tries to understand as best he can.

So I have a bit of a problem.  Over the last 12-18 months I've developed a bit of a cocaine addiction.  I am in a social circle of friends and am heavily involved in the night life / night club scene where recreational use of many different drugs is extremely common; so completely removing myself from situations where it, and other drugs are available is impossible, unless I drastically change my life - which is not something I want to do.  I do not consider that I have a problem with any other drug usage than cocaine.

I am in my mid 30's, highly intelligent and a sucessful person.  I have always earnt extremely well and my usage has never caused any noticable financial impact or hardship.  I don't struggle to hold down jobs - in fact its the opposite, I find it very easy to get good and well paid work - but to be frank, my skill set is quite niche; and generally involves working remotely or from home across varied time zones so I can get away with things I wouldn't be able to in another position that was office based.

My usage varies a lot.  It's always sniffed, never smoked or injected.  I can easily go two weeks without using, or thinking about using - as long as I have something to distract my mind with.  If I'm on holiday, travellig for business, or even taking breaks away from home I have no issues at all with cravings during those times.

However, I often find that during my journey home from wherever I've been, I get to a certain point;say 1 hour from home, and the thought then pops into my head.  Sometimes I phone my dealer before I even arrive home, so I know he will arrive shortly after I do.  With the pandemic, this behaviour has changed a bit (As I'm not going out as much) so I'm generally just in the house and making calls when I get a craving - but those cravings don't follow me out of the house (Unless I'm doing something social with my friends)

The binge stage varies, it can be as little as a few hours (an evening, or a full day) or it can last much longer.  Sometimes I will work all day, perhaps make an order in the afternoon, and then stay up all night working on creative projects that interest me (outside of my day job) reading, or rarely playing video games.   I'll then work through the next day without sleep; using until I run out, and then go to bed around 9-10pm and wake up for work the next day.   I'll consume around 1-2 grams over a 24 hour period generally.  I'd average it at about 1.5.  If I had to put a number on it I'd say I do this on average once a week, with a few week or two gaps here and there when I'm otherwise occupied.

I find it difficult not to ""just have a little bit"" if I have some in the house.  The thought enters my mind; I resist for a while; then I have a ""little bit"".  Then that little bit turns into more, and I generally just keep going until its all gone.  Sometimes I can go 3-4 days in a row with very little sleep (0-5 hours a night) although they are the more severe cases.

What I want help and advice with is curbing this bad habit.  I find it confusing because I tell myself I'm not addicted, because I can honestly go for weeks without even thinking about it... Yet when it's there in my house, I find it really hard to resist.  I generally find when I'm a bit bored, demotivated, or don't have a lot to do I will get an order in, but the time between the end of a binge, and the next craving that prompts an order can last days or weeks and during that time I don't think about it at all.

I have toyed with using an electronically lockable timed safe with varying success.  It generally works, but sometimes I convince myself that ""now"" is an appropriate time to have some and its not due to open for some time yet; so I break it open (its made of plastic)

I don't really suffer any negative impact on my life as a result either.  It doesn't cause me money issues. I don't have issues with work; In fact I often can be more productive when using, but thats probably a result of the lack of productivity caused by the crash when I'm not.

My main concern is my health.  I feel fine physically but long term use to this level is not good fpr me.

I guess what I want to do is to find a way to reduce my usage, or even stop it entirely; But I cannot at this moment remove myself from situations where it is available socially without completely changing my life.   I worry that if I look into any official recovery programs, they simply won't be compatible with my lifestyle.

I know a lot of this takes effort and discipline, but I guess what I want to do right now is open up a little about it and get some advice and encouragement about how to tackle it.  I think I'm going to make an effort going forward to simply stop using it; even in social situations.  But I'm interested in all of your thoughts and advice on what I've said...",2

It started over 15 years ago after I was prescribed them. Intermittently I‚Äôve used 30/500 and shop bought 8/500 and been taking silly amounts. 

I‚Äôm sick and tired of it. My whole life revolves around these pills and it affects everything. So I‚Äôm stopping. 

I‚Äôve tried cold turkey before and just can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs awful. So I‚Äôm going to taper. I have my script of 100 30/500 for the month and I‚Äôve gave them to my SO to keep. They have been aware I take the pills and hates it. I hide the amount though. I basically feel like a junkie. 

They will give me 4x tabs daily for 2 weeks. Then 3x tabs for 2 weeks. Il get my new script of 100 then do 2x tabs for 2 weeks and finally 1x tab for 2 weeks. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is a good taper plan or not? I‚Äôve seen that you can reduce by 20% each time you go down a dose. I‚Äôve chosen the two week plan so my body gets used to taking only 120mg as I could easily take triple that. 

It‚Äôs been a couple of days on the 120mg and none of the usual tummy pains or runny stomach, just very slight RLS, nothing compared to usual withdrawals. But my mind is just constantly thinking of those pills. And I‚Äôve not even stopped yet. 

Is there anything else I can do to help during the coming 8 weeks? I‚Äôd also love some support and hopefully this can help keep me accountable.",0

I got to the hotel and she was being escorted out by someone carrying her bags. She got in the car. She‚Äôs trembling. Crying. Shaking her head and mumbling ‚ÄúNo, Mama‚Äù over and over. 

Her best friend is gone. He had locked the door to the bathroom saying he was going to shower. When she realized he had been in there a bit too long, she tried calling out to him. 

He couldn‚Äôt answer. 

By the time someone forced entry into the bathroom, he was gone. 

But she tried...she tried so hard. She used the Narcan I make her carry and she bravely called 911. But it was too late....

She talked to the detectives and Coroner. They all were so very kind and reassuring, explaining that there was nothing more she could‚Äôve done. Telling her how proud they are of her actions. Telling her how very brave she was. 

So now she‚Äôs home...again. I have to be awake in two hours to prepare for work. Her Daddy doesn‚Äôt know she‚Äôs here yet. He doesn‚Äôt know I left our home two hours ago in a nightgown and flip flops because our baby needed me. Oh, but he will be so happy she‚Äôs here. 

And just like last time, we will love her and enjoy her being here until she decides she doesn‚Äôt want to be here any longer. 

But unlike last time, she saw Death. She saw how Death doesn‚Äôt discriminate. She has been resuscitated seven times with Narcan.  But her friend could not be saved this once. She‚Äôs been given seven opportunities while her friend was given none. She now knows that while Narcan CAN  restore breathing, it does not always choose to restore life. 

And.....I hope she knows I wouldn‚Äôt have survived what she just went through had the person dead in the shower been her.",35

What started out as something fun and casual turned into a full blown addiction that we were trapped in for months. It was something my boyfriend and I tried and liked the feeling of a lot. It made us social, it made our sex better etc. After a couple times, we told ourselves we wouldn't do it again though. But then every time we ran out of weed or just were bored we bought meth. It was easy to come by and cheap.


 Eventually we were doing it for a week straight and realized we should stop. But it's like we couldn't. I noticed myself and my boyfriend slowly turning into different people. We were always agitated, fighting and paranoid. Things would get violent at times. I almost never ate anymore and the hallucinations were getting bad. It made both of us so numb we never even laughed anymore. All we cared about was when we would get high again. I wanted to quit because I realized it was making me extremely suicidal and not just when I was coming down. I was suicidal while high on it and it was making my mental illness so much worse. But yet I kept doing it without even realizing it. It wasn't fun anymore. But if it was front of me, I would just do it even though it was ruining my life.


 One day, my boyfriend and I decided to smoke some and then later went to pick up some weed for the come down. He hit his friends bong too and then on the drive home he told me his heart was pounding out of his chest and his body started to go numb on one side to the point where he felt like he couldn't move. When we got home, he called an ambulance. They took him to the hospital and his heart was beating so fast they had to give him valium through an IV. He almost died that day. The whole experience was so traumatic for both of us.  And now, he's developed a severe panic disorder from doing meth. 


I so badly wish we never tried it. I know I must have overdosed several times from it too and Ive seen what it has done to my brother who is addicted to it. Its the nastiest drug out there and I guess I'm sharing my story because so many people are doing it now and think that it's difficult to overdose from or its easy to just stop. It's not. Meth is by far the worst and hardest addiction to quit. It's not worth the high. It's just not. I just hope that someone reads this and can get something from it and maybe it'll help someone that is struggling with this addiction. And if you've never tried it, don't",143

I still have a couple of vapes lying around (I forgot to give them  away), but I‚Äôve actually been able to resist all urges and temptation for 6 WHOLE DAYS. This is huge. It had been almost 2 years since I went even half a day without vaping or smoking nicotine products. 

I had been decreasing my nicotine levels, knowing I should quit. I was at a point where I think all I needed was just one push and I could give it up... and then I got the push. I give credit to the man I met and fell in love with who expressed his dislike towards me vaping. That was the push I needed.. I wanted to do it for him and I wanted to do it for me. I credit him because I‚Äôm working to accept that having help is not shameful. He actually really believed that I can do this, and it encouraged me like I‚Äôve never been encouraged before. 
I also credit myself too though... this is one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to do. 6 days with no nicotine and I‚Äôm stilllll getting the urge to vape. I drink and smoke weed, and when I‚Äôm buzzed from either, I want to vape or smoke cigs... I‚Äôm not going to stop drinking or smoking weed, but I know it probably would be best if I did. At least I‚Äôm aware of what triggers urges (other drugs, stress etc), and I can resist. 

There was a solid point in time where I was convinced that I would be addicted to nicotine forever, and that that would be ok. There was also a point in time where I didn‚Äôt even realize I was addicted. It took some self-evaluation and a reality check, and a nudge from a person I love.. I did it. I‚Äôm so proud of myself. I can‚Äôt go back to nicotine after feeling this accomplished.. I couldn‚Äôt bear the guilt.. that‚Äôs how addiction works, but I‚Äôm fighting the pattern of relapse. I wish you all the best too.

I gradually started boozing, then using again. Now, I'm a mid 30s daily pothead, with my morning dose of doctor prescribed dextroamphetamine. During the past 3 or so years using speed, I've had some breaks, but I wasn't doing well off, and I started again. I had some abstinence from weed too, but I can't even remember whether I liked being more off than on. Regarding PMO, I've never been able to really stop. And nail-biting is a life long habit that I've tried to resolve but haven't been able to. 

One issue I'm having currently with even getting started with a new being-sober experiment is the thought that I'd only be doing it for other people and not myself. I have little motivation on my own to stop other than that I think my partner will eventually find my resolve lacking and leave me, and I will probably cause some disaster in my work place, which will put me under pressure to move cities, or careers, until I run out of options and die alone. As bad as that sounds, I'm quite comfortable with this degree of certainty about my progress, which is to say, I'm living a pretty shitty self fulfilling prophecy of my own making.

But, I can't seem to imagine anything else. I don't have any real desires when it comes down to it. I say I want certain things like my own children, a marriage, a house, a family, but the truth is I think I like my life. And even when I wake up a bit and realize that I hate the way my life is headed, the self-disgust, the self-reproach, the self-hatred isn't enough to make me try anything different. And again, I find it hard to imagine how my life could be any better solely because I stopped my addictions. 

So, I suppose what I'm saying is that I have no positive reasons to quit, and only negative consequences to avoid. Since I'm delusional about my uniqueness (I think the drugs won't affect me long term), I always tell myself, ""tomorrow I'll quit"". And when I see for a moment that the long term affects are going to be permanent, I think, even if I could imagine a better life, I won't have ot, because I've already ruined the possibility of actually having that life by damaging my brain.",4

I am a gay man in a large city, and I go out a lot during normal times and I'm a DJ myself. Use of G recreationally has become very common in this subculture and over the years I started becoming seduced by how it is dirt cheap, easy, quick and has no hangover or immediate negative effects if you don't overdo it. 

Overdoing it is very easy to do, however, and can have severe consequences.

Somehow, while partying with some friends Saturday night in a large Air BnB (about 20 of us, all with recent negative COVID tests and with no outsiders), I miscalculated my doses of G, from a supply that I suspect maybe contained something else given the severity of what happened next. I slipped into a state of fighting unconsciousness, and for some reason also wound up swallowing a small wooden clothespin and choking. How or why I put that in my mouth, I have no idea, and nobody witnessed me doing it.

The important thing is that friends were monitoring me when it was clear I was overdosing on G, and helped me vomit up the clothespin and also remove a fragment of it from my throat. They called 911, but before paramedics got there I was becoming completely non-responsive - one of them knew to bring me back through a rough pressure technique on my sternum. I shudder to think how far I might have slipped if he hadn't been there.

I only remember confusing and terrifying flashes of all of this before waking up in a hospital bed a few hours later. 

I have never truly known what it means to be grateful for your life until now, and grateful for the friends and people who love you, and I am committed to change. I have my first discussion today with an addiction counselor who is gay and familiar with this substance and my ""backup"" substances, and comes recommended by two of my best friends. I don't know if I need to stay sober forever, but I want to spend a lot of time rediscovering who that person is, and will at the very least never touch G again.

This is just a post to say that second chances are a gift, and I don't want to waste mine.",7

I‚Äôve been super supportive &amp; encouraging because I know it‚Äôs not easy to talk about or be vulnerable.

What's my approach here? I have finally ""reeled it in"". I have a job , I pay the bills, money is put to its proper place before extras. but I will still spend foolishly to an extent that it's not benefiting my long term goal/happiness. I live at my parents and have tons of freedom and opportunity so my mistakes aren't as serious as they could potentially be.

Is there a trick to this? I want to be an idiot and be foolish, but I lack the discipline I expect of myself. Nothing is seriously hurting me long term - I have every opportunity. I'd still like to discuss with you guys about this situation, which I feel is quite common.",8

But then, the day that quarantine started I decided to play some video games with some friends just to spend some free time, since I had so much more than I was used to.

But 5 months later, and I haven‚Äôt made much more progress. I‚Äôve sold all consoles, deleted all games from my computer and phone, and prevented me from getting them in the future, but I now spend roughly 8-10 hours on YouTube a day, and an additional 4 hours on other social media(reddit included). I have only worked out a handful of times in the last 5 months, when I used to work out 3-5 hours a day, everyday, and loved it. I also used to study an hour a day for the SATs, and it‚Äôs coming up in 2 weeks, and I‚Äôve yet to study once since quarantine started. I was so on track to achieving my goals, and the workload was in no way too hard for me. Now I feel like I have no chance at even playing bball in college. I‚Äôve also lost all muscle mass I gained through lifting, and am as strong as I was 2-3 years ago, before I started lifting. Anyone got any advice on how I get over my YouTube addiction?

I'm sorry if this is self indulgent but I need to write this. There's just too much going on and quarantine has only made this worse, as I'm sure it has for everyone. I've been addicted to my computer, more specifically the internet, for 7 years.  While it's not the worst addiction in the world, it's just sucking the life out of me and I can't focus for more than 2 minutes without wanting to go back online again. I've tried blockers, limiting my screen time but they don't stop me from disabling them and just wasting fuck all time and money on crap I don't need. The urges are getting stronger and my studies, mental clarity and general health is suffering. It's always been difficult  to manage, now it's at a point where I can't stop (I mean, I'm writing a post on the internet about my internet addiction, go figure). I've also developed a binge eating disorder which hasn't helped and I feel gross. There's just too many urges to deal with, I feel like I can't fight them anymore and I'm running out of options.

\-I started smoking when I was 13 and within around five months I was smoking daily. Usually at night. This has gone on for almost four years. I'm depressed when I'm not stoned so I smoke and then after that I get more depressed so I smoke more and the cycle continues. My memory is absolute shit. My mind just feels so clouded and terrible.

\-Over the last few years, I've had the realization that I'm really dependent on pot about six times. The most recent time I cried. A lot. I don't really cry that often so it shook me. I'm trying to stop for just one week and it's so stupidly hard. I'm so mad at myself. I really feel as though I ruined my brain way too early. I'm depressed and anxious and I feel terribly alone even when I'm with my favorite people.

I tried to take responsibility and booked myself twice in rehab now. The first time I relapsed within 3 months and the second within 1 month.

Because of my addiction, I dropped out of University on my final year and it's been so long since I did that that if I wanted to go back I'd have to start again. I'm sinking deeper into debt, people know I have a problem but since I come from a relativity comfortable family I somewhat still have a seemingly okay life and the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I'm afraid it would devastate them, however if I continue living I'm afraid one day they'll find me out and then I could never imagine the disappointment then.

I don't enjoy laughing, I am always isolated because of the shame, I left my wife because I felt like I didn't deserve her and she's better of without me and these days as soon as I get money I spend it on a fix Instead of facing my problems.

I fear I'll never stop, I talk to a therapist but I lie to her about the drug use and so I feel even worse that I'm successfully lying to a professional.

I‚Äôm M36 and discovered the awesome world of drugs 2 years ago (kind of). I‚Äôve always been a social drinker, but that was never a problem for me. Weed? No, thanks, I‚Äôve always had this awful low tolerance and it just lets me quiet and locked up in a mindspace I don‚Äôt enjoy.

10-12 years ago I‚Äôve discovered the ‚Äújoys‚Äù of cocaine. It is what it is and I felt it was veeeryyy addictive, from a psychological POV. Luckily, I couldn‚Äôt afford it so it kind of washed away from my mind. On a side note, I‚Äôve always loved to masturbate (even while in relashionships). It was something harmless, never done any harm to my normal/social life.

I never really had a HUGE interest in drugs since I kind of like to be in control of what I‚Äôm doing (I‚Äôm moderate with alcohol btw), but tried MDMA a couple times and it didn‚Äôt do shit to me (low doses, perhaps). But 2 years ago I went to this festival and after 2 days trying more low doses of it (finger dabbing) I asked for bag and took a respectful chunk out of it (with my gf). It was awesome, of course. Details aside, I remember thinking ‚Äúoh, so every night can be like this?‚Äù. Ok, I was wrong, obviously. But the months that followed I very much abused it, mainly alone at home. And while doing it I found that it was an awesome thing to do while jerking off to some sensual, soft porn. Again, I have a gf and sex was never a problem, but this was some next level shit. Cocaine came along again once in that time, but I really didn‚Äôt stick to it as I was looking for that MDMAish feeling.

In a couple months I tried and loved LSD (still my all time favorite drug) and yes, self-pleasure was and option (sometimes a weird one, but whatever). Skip half a year and I found myself again in the presence of coke. An awful night, took acid, MDMA, thc edibles and a few lines. Big time paranoia. But somehow a little bit of coke was left and it was in my house. So, I gave a third chance and I learned to go around coke dick (the same happened with MDMA). And I loved it. 

Since that (one year ago) I spent a lot of money on it. Sometimes it is kind of a daily thing. Initially I leaned on a friend that has this very nice contact with the best coke I‚Äôve ever tried, but quickly got into some other connections, that didn‚Äôt judge my semi-daily habit. It has made me borrow money from family and friends and I‚Äôm always lying so I can get money for some more C. In the way I tried some other stuff, like dmt, speed and ketamine, and of course that I jerked off on those.

Cocaine is supposed to be a social lubricant, but to be honest, I use it in other way. I buy a gram or so at 4pm and go home (when I‚Äôm alone) and jerk off until it‚Äôs over. Sometimes I buy more after that and wait my gf to be asleep to jerk off a little bit more. 

Covid fucked me up a little bit, I reckon, but my jerk off imagination is running out of ideas and I find myself doing it just because so. Sometimes I can‚Äôt even come and just think ‚Äúwell, maybe tomorrow‚Äù.

I hate this and I don‚Äôt find I‚Äôm able to speak about this with anyone. Shame would be the appropriate word for what I feel, and it could be a good feeling as a motivation for kicking it, but as some of you know, it is very fiendish and I‚Äôm not really a dumb person. I can always get an excuse for what I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm not really into speaking out with a friend or anything as this is so shameful.

How can I kick it by myself? I can‚Äôt avoid the triggers as they are part of the person I became in the last 20 years or so.

Any ideas? I‚Äôd be forever grateful.

TL;DR: I‚Äôm addicted to drugs, mainly coke, and jerking off. I need help.",5

Sorry about the length, on mobile, ya da ya da. 
Here‚Äôs a backstory. 

My SO has been addicted to heroin for years. He got clean 5 years ago for 2.5 years, he bought a car he loved which his girlfriend totaled in a drunk accident. That same night he found out that she had been hiding that she‚Äôd been using for the entire time he was struggling to get clean. She stopped hiding it & just did it in front of him & after he graduated drug court he wanted to do it ‚Äújust one last time‚Äù. 
A few weekends ago, I found out that she‚Äôd been selling him 20 old Xanax pills every two-three days using it to hold over him to see him & get him to spend time with her. And possibly breaking us up since he‚Äôs a monster on Xanax. However, I don‚Äôt fight with him when he‚Äôs fucked up. He won‚Äôt remember, I wait til he‚Äôs sober. Well, we stayed in all weekend getting the Xanax out of his system. Our first day out he had a seizure in my car. I feel so grateful people were around because I couldn‚Äôt even open my phone to dial 911, all I could think was he was going to die before I could even call an ambulance. He had a few more seizures after that but not as serious. I started using occasionally at the end of last year, I‚Äôve had three different experiences where I stopped breathing, once with an ambulance involved. Originally I thought, ‚Äúthe more I ask to do it, he‚Äôll hate it and he‚Äôll quit.‚Äù Such a stupid and naive thought. I‚Äôd snort half a pill, vomit, and nod off. The feeling was amazing. Then one day I was really uncomfortable, he told me to snort a pill and that‚Äôs when I realized I was dependent. My mother was a heroin used in her twenties, both my parents were crack users in their thirties. My mom died being an alcoholic and my dad continues to struggle with his alcoholism. Addiction is in my family. 
After a couple blood tests we found that there was no heroin in SOs system, only fentanyl. While getting off the Xanax we made a plan that we are done. There‚Äôs an amazing company in our area that gives you free comfort meds. Pills for anxiety, muscle cramps, agitation, high blood pressure, sleep, & suboxone. Just picked up his prescriptions this morning and he had his last fent pill at 10AM. I‚Äôm going a little slower, I‚Äôve had two all day but I want to be able to help him through this and not be sick as well. I‚Äôm excited about our future, he‚Äôs been asleep almost all day. I woke him up a few times to eat but I know tomorrow will be significantly worse. 

I‚Äôd appreciate any advice on this, what to expect, how I can help him, etc. what can I personally expect when I cut down completely, I will most likely do this Sunday or Monday. Weening myself down seems like it‚Äôll help (during the summer I could go through 30+ pills a day). How do I help after to keep us motivated and on track? Talking about our future goals and plans also seems like that keeps him motivated for it. He knows he‚Äôll die in >10 years. 
Also has anyone ever used Kratom? It seems like it could be dangerous and I don‚Äôt want that to turn into an addiction but I thought about grabbing it & maybe give him two a day until he starts feeling better? If Kratom is a good move what kind should I get? 

Thanks to anyone who responds! And again, sorry about the length & if this post seems to be all over the place. 

TLDR: getting off of fentanyl. How can I help? What should I expect?",9

1. Intro
Hello so I am 20yo male, bipolar, I‚Äôve been seeing psychiatrist for about 2 years now.
I have several(like 10) suicide attempts on my record first one was when I was 8, tried to line my wrists. Two of these suicide attempts were nearly successfull. I am a child of broken home and I have a very bad relationships with my parents. I was beaten when I was a child and this is probably why my mental state got fucked up.  
I am ashamed of this and I had to go a long road before actually facing the fact that I am mentally ill. I used to stop taking my medications because I thought that I shouldn‚Äôt take them because I didn‚Äôt want to accept the fact that I am ill. Used to think that I am a normal person, I was lying to myself so much that I believed in it. 

2. Becoming an artist
I didn‚Äôt really have much friends and I actually found it easier for me to talk with girls instead of boys. They seemed closer to me on emotional level so I got labeled as ‚Äúcrybaby‚Äù and was bullied a lot. From bullying I learned how much hate there is in human. Therefore I got anxiety and insecurity. But I always was passionate about music. Discovered Linkin Park as a kid, then got into Nirvana and Green Day. I went fully into Kurt Cobain‚Äôs biography and I got a strong connection with his music and his personality. So I bought a guitar at the age of 12 with the money I got from selling almost all my clothes. I didn‚Äôt have anything else to do so I just played for days, after two weeks of self-learning from YouTube videos I managed to become pretty good at playing and I started to learn Nirvana songs, years passed and I got into a couple of bands but it didn‚Äôt really work out for me. It was 2016 and I got into Lil Peep. I still tried to accomplish something with grunge/punk rock  but nothing worked out. After Lil Peeps death I went all in into his kind of music and it worked. I am not a very popular artist but I got some fans. 


3. Drug part

I don‚Äôt propose drug use. Drugs are a slippery road and you must think twice before trying them.

I have tried marijuana when I was 16, first it wasn‚Äôt big of a deal, because I did it occasionally with some phony friends. After some time I started to smoke alone and at some point it helped me relax and get away from all this bs. At the age of 18 I didn‚Äôt have friends at all. So I spent my time alone, got into stimulants and oh boy it all went wrong after this, I got really hooked on Molly and Amphetamine. Spent all my money on it, simply because they made me more opened and confident. Marathoned a lot. I didn‚Äôt really care about myself so I just rolled and rolled until I got placed into asylum after another suicide attempt. Tried to run away a few times, didn‚Äôt work. Went through a rehab and then got off stimulants. Was prescribed Xanax for anxiety and a bunch of other meds and of fucking course I abused it. Used to skip the days. Felt like heaven cuz I didn‚Äôt have to do anything but sleep and it helped me get away from my thoughts. After some time I met a guy, who‚Äôs now my one and only best friend and at that point I felt ashamed of being an addict and with the help of my psychiatrist and my friend dropped Xan, but after some time she prescribed me Ritalin, I tricked her into it and I feel very bad about it. Aaaaand I  abused it. On daily bases. I was prescribed one pack a month, it included 30 pills 10mg. Of course I ran out of those quickly so I struggled with cravings  and I felt very depressed and suicidal. I didn‚Äôt tell this to my bestfriend because I was afraid he was going to dump me. After like three months of this I told him and my psychiatrist about it. My doc wasn‚Äôt very happy about it but she still helped me. Right now I am taking all my meds as I am prescribed to. 
After I tried LSD and damn, this shit changed my whole mindset. I got like reset or something and I understood many things and realised a lot about myself and made a big progress after.


4. My advice 

So to all of you who really struggle to find your place in this world I‚Äôll tell you this: Never let people tell you who you should be. Always stay true to yourself and remember that you matter. Always. You can do it. Even if it seems hopeless keep on trying it will get better eventually, it won‚Äôt happen instantly and you might not notice it but every time you face yourself and problems you become a better version of yourself. Start with simple things like waking up at the right time or simply brushing your teeth. Make yourself do it, even if you fail it‚Äôs okay, life goes on and you got the time. It‚Äôs never too late. Nobody is perfect so start with yourself and believe in yourself even if everybody around tells you that you are shit. Live life the way you want, not the way anybody else wants, be what you wanna be. 

5. Ending, my life now.

Right now I take my meds the way I am prescribed. Working on a new album and I am clean from all drugs I used to do for 6 months. I love myself. And I am actually enjoying my life. 

Love you, stay strong. Thank you for reading",27

I‚Äôm addicted to Videogames/porn/weed/nicotine/cocaine I‚Äôve always had an addiction prone personality. Only habit I‚Äôve ever kicked is drinking and only because work had guided me through it. It feels as if I‚Äôve lost the person I was before all of it ; my intelligence seems to have been smoked right out of my head, my relationships uprooted and burnt on the altar of a dopamine rush. 


Tell myself I can recover, if I try targeting them one after another, learned techniques such as dopamine fasting, reward systems and etc. After initial success I always cave again once left to my own devices. I am ashamed of myself and hate myself. I‚Äôve tried quitting smoking(nicotine/weed) for the past year, had some dry spells but always relapsed. At my lowest point digging my vape out of the trash to try and get a hit. I am my own worst enemy and enough of my critical thinking remains to see it. I have masturbated up to 6 times a day once only to amplify my shame and self-hatred, each time in my remorse telling myself I will get it under control and never do.  My thoughts are so counter to my actions, I question if wanting to quit is just a lie I tell myself as an excuse to keep living. 

Video games have derailed my career and diminished my time physical health. It seems the only source of gratification I can get is achievement in video games, once an avid reader I can barely get through 2 pages before turning to one of my vices. I don‚Äôt know why/how I did this to myself, but I‚Äôm beginning to see no way out.  To seek medical help would destroy what hope remains for revitalizing my career. 

I have squandered my potential, isolated myself, and let fall by the wayside any skills I once had.",3

It took me a lot of effort, but I haven't played video games for about 4 years now. However, there has recently been a new installment in a series I used to love playing ever since I was a child.

I would love to play this game and my mind has been machinating for about 6 months on whether I should purchase it or not.

So, my questions are: Has anyone experienced these feelings before? Have you decided to buy/play the game? And if so, how did you prevent yourself from going into the dark abyss of video-game addiction? If you didn't purchase/play the game, how did you get it out of your mind?",2

2020-08-05 23:49:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/i4kle1/my_dad_took_my_xanax_away/,My dad took my Xanax away.,"I picked up my medication yesterday, I saw a psychiatrist the day before. I was prescribed Xanax (0.5 mg), Lyrica, bupropion, and a few supplements. I'm fifteen, and I have a history of process/behavioral addictions, compulsive habits and impulsivity. I smoke \~7 times a day. I also have a family history of alcoholism and substance abuse. 

I have C-PTSD from ongoing and previous abuse. I constantly feel on edge, unsafe, and really fucking anxious. There's never any fucking escape from it. I was hesitant about the Xanax and Lyrica, since I know both can easily cause addiction (more so the Xanax), but I tried it yesterday, and it took *everything* away. For the first time in I can't remember how long, I felt *safe* and at ease, cozy and *warm*. I wasn't anxious at all; my anxiety was completely gone. When it wore off a few hours later and I started getting anxious again, I took another .25 mg, and when that wasn't effective enough, I took the rest of the .50 mg pill. For the first night in *months*, I didn't have any nightmares and I fell asleep early.  

I didn't take any this morning because I wasn't too anxious, and I'd decided that I would only take it when I need it, which would still probably be once every day or so. My dad (who's also an abusive narcissist) took my Xanax away today. I saved two pills in advance because I knew he'd do that, and even though he'd said I could just ask him for some when I needed it, he doesn't believe the extent of my debilitating anxiety, and unless I have a full-on panic attack in front of him, I doubt he'll ever give it to me. Either I'm good at unconsciously hiding it, or he's just fucking blind, but he doesn't believe in my mental illnesses and how debilitating they are. The past year I've been absolutely failing in school, not going out, self-harming to oblivion, and have been absolutely unable to function. He thinks I'm purposely doing all of it for attention or for some kind of screwed-up ego trip. 

I've spent the last forty minutes crying, I self-harmed a bit, smoked a couple of cigarettes, and I just don't know what to feel. Now that I know what it's like to feel warm and safe and comforted, how can I ever go back? It's been *years* since the last time I wasn't anxious. I can sort-of cope with the anxiety, push it back and distract myself, but it's always fucking there. Every waking minute is filled with it, there's never any real break or escape. I'm seeing a decent, competent psychologist. I've tried absolutely everything that's supposed to help. I draw and write, I try grounding exercises, I've tried SSRI's, meditation, etc. But nothing ever takes it away. 

I just don't really know what to do, where I draw the line between a medication that I *need,* or something that makes me feel good (which could easily turn into an addiction). I know benzo addictions are particularly severe and not something to be fucked around with. Any advice would be very helpful and appreciated, and I'm sorry if this post is messy.

Edit/update/whatever: I saw my psychologist the other day and was corrected about how often I could take it, so for now just for panic attacks (I was quite wrong in thinking I could take it every day). I might not even take it at all, given the fact that I have zero ability to moderate myself, and things like this are very easy for me to lose control of. I‚Äôve already mostly forgotten what it felt like, so I‚Äôm not super tempted to take it. The day after I wrote this post, I spent a full seven hours continuously, uncontrollably crying.

TL;DR (will post at bottom too) My(25F) Significant Other (36M)  has been using meth amphetamine for a year. I knew for the whole time but he just really opened up 7 days ago and brought me to his dealers and introduced me to a prostitute that hooks him up as well. He is using guilt tactics on me, risking custody of his children, disregarding our finances, and destroying our relationship. I need advice on what to do and maybe just some supportive words. 

I am 25 my SO is 36. We've been together for 5 years, and are married. We have three children (my stepchildren). 

A year ago we had some boarders who were family of his. They were deep into a meth amphetamine addiction, my husband was clean (from Oxycontin and Cocaine) for 10 years. We found out they were using and kicked them out, they found a place in 2 weeks and were gone. Before they moved, my husband went downstairs and used some stuff they had down there. Since then, he's used. It's been almost 1 year now. I've known the entire time, because of behaviour change. He is on methadone, so when he lost his carries I knew for sure. He still lied through the whole thing until about 8 months ago. During covid they gave him 1 carry on Sundays because they're only open for 3 hours that day and wanted to minimize the amount of patients that go in there that day. He lied and told me it was because he'd been clean. 

He left his scale out about a week ago and I brought it to him. His children were there so I handed it to him and sent him a text saying, we kicked people out of our home because of this for our children. Please don't expose our children to your drug paraphernalia. Naturally, he lost it on me and said I should have just left it out. (The kids didn't see me give it to him). After that he opened up a little, he asked me to go for a drive with him. I asked why, he said why do you think? It was obvious to me he wanted to go pick up drugs, I said fine BUT I want to talk about a plan to stop this. I wanted to see the people he was associating with, where he was going, what he was doing... everything. I want him to be safe. It was heartbreaking. He couldn't find his dealer, I saw him getting angry and frustrated. He was looking all over the place at everyone who walked by in case it was his dealer or someone who would know where to get it. We were driving and he pulled over and let a prostitute into our car, apparently she goes to his Methadone clinic and hooked him up with this guy initially. I was completely taken aback and blown away. He said he'd only seen her then and maybe 2 more times since. I talked to him after she left and said I don't know how you expect me to feel that you've been hanging out with prostitutes on top of all this. We used to be close and had no secrets, he never would have done something like this in a million years sober. He had to stop looking to get his kids, which he was late for. He went back at 930 and I had to lie to his kids about where their dad was going, never got any again. He was going to go again at midnight but never got the call. The next morning he went again and got it. I talked to him about it a day later like I said we would, he told me, ""Don't make me regret telling you."" We ended with in the next couple of months I'm taking him away out of the city for a week and knocking this shit off. He is prescribed Vyvanse which he doesn't abuse, but I guess why would he have to. He doesn't take his Vyvanse properly at all so we have a stock pile. I said we would start having him take that properly and it might help him. Then once we get that sorted, that's when we will go away. He agreed. I saw this was a much bigger problem than I thought and said I would like to go at the end of this month. I know it won't be effective unless he wants to, though. 

Tonight I asked him if he wanted to go for a little drive together, he said sure and I was happy. We never do anything together anymore since this. Then he decided on our drive to stop at the dealers house. I begged him not to, he said i don't know if I want to anyway. I said okay so then drive away now then. After 2 minutes, nope.. he went in. The dealer wasn't there. When he got back into the car, I was quiet for about 30 seconds. He was talking to me and i didn't answer. He then freaked out on me about ""ignoring him."" I asked him to be reasonable and allow me a minute to collect my thoughts. He saw another user on the street and asked about where his dealer was. This individual was in very rough shape, obviously deep into a long battle with addiction. I needed a little minute again, he snapped about me ""ignoring him twice"". 

Tonight at home I tried calmly talking to him again... he absolutely lost it on me. Said that's it and he's doing it behind my back now. I said I'm just trying to talk to you, how is that fair? He screamed I can't do this anymore. Look at you, you're falling apart. (Not in a kind way either, in a way like you're crazy look at you!) I finally yelled back for the first time since all of this, through tears, and said Yes I am falling apart. Because you're falling apart. He screamed for me to leave then. He stood up I asked where are you going now, he said Upstairs to the bathroom. Is that okay with you? While he went upstairs I broke down. He just kept yelling at me to stop crying. 

I know projection is huge with this illness. But I am feeling so defeated by it all. He is going to lose the children and his job if this keeps up. They're my stepchildren so I'll lose them too. We had 100 dollars left at the end of this pay period and he spent 60 of it on that. We had 350 put away for our health benefits that will be canceled if not paid on time, he put us 40 dollars short for that too. Apparently his friend was coming to give him a hundred he owed him, it still hasn't happened so... we luckily got paid early and didn't miss it but it was close, honestly hours close. He went out the night before they were due and spent it. The payment came out on the 4th and we got paid on the 4th. He thought it was going to be on the 7th (Friday is normally the pay day).

I'm broken, my best friend and the man I love with everything is just throwing it all away. I can't talk to him about my feelings or any way that his actions are affecting our family. If I talk to anyone else about it, he will be furious. I've lost my confidante(him) and I have no one to talk to or cry to.

I'm so sorry this is so long... I have a year of hurt and fear bottled up in me and haven't been able to talk to a soul for the whole time. Also, I'm too upset and tired for punctuation or grammar all together so I'm sorry for that too. 

I guess I just needed to vent, obviously by the long post, and get some advice on what I should do here. Leaving him isn't on the table for me, but I'm scared he won't give me another choice one day. I've always got his back and am here but I'm nervous I'm going to have to draw a line in order to get him to get well. I'd obviously be waiting for him and would only do it to get him better.

I think I have a unique situation going on and I need some advice. Basically I am currently addicted to kratom. I try to quit it and end up relapsing a few weeks later due to how crappy I feel. I have also struggled with OCD in the past but recently I have not really had any obsessive issues. When I am sober, I do feel depressed but I think this is due to kratom withdrawals and I don't know if I have depression when I am sober and not in withdrawals.

My issue is I will be on top of things for weeks and doing well and then I will end up self sabotaging and falling back into bad habits. I have felt stuck in place for years because of this cycle. I do often relapse because of how crappy I feel, but I don't know if this is due to my brain being damaged from drug abuse or mental issues I have that could be helped with an antidepressant. I did have quite severe OCD when I was a lot younger, but more recently I'm not sure if I would even be diagnosed with it.

Basically, I'm afraid to start the SSRI. Since I feel fine the majority of the time, what will it do to me during those times? I really don't know if I am depressed and I don't really have OCD like I used to when I was a kid. I want to stay away from kratom for a while to find my baseline, but I end up relapsing over and over again.

It kind of feels like I am balancing on a tight rope and it is very easy to fall off of that tight rope into bad habits. Now if an SSRI turned that into a walkway rather than a tightrope I would want to take it, but I have no experiences with SSRIs so I don't know what it will do to me. I just don't want to be dependent on something if I don't absolutely need it.

Sorry if this is kind of scatterbrained, I am currently in withdrawal and have no energy mentally.",3

I'm pretty sure I'm addicted to dating/hookup sites such as fabguys/fabswingers and grindr. I flirt with guys until I 'get off' then I delete the app and it's been that way everyday for a few weeks now. Now that I'm so used to it, I do it without even thinking about it. I don't lead anyone on or anything like that but I've noticed its pretty much an addiction now. 

I wouldn't class myself as gay or anything like that but for some reason I get a huge rush when I flirt with other guys.

I want to try and stop this before it spirals out of control so I'd appreciate any advice anyone has or any solutions anyone can think of!!

I came around a Dopamine Detox, which pretty much you dont fap, do social media, watch TV, etc.  This will stabilize your dopamine levels to enjoy mundane yet good activities.  


My plan is to, after months of lying to myself, stop all substances and do a dopamine detox.  Also another reason why I fail is b/c I stopped thinking about improving.

Why not enjoy life and use cannabis all day, everyday? Is cannabis addiction really bad? (Need answers and motivation)","Hello, so I don‚Äôt want this to be taken down for seeming to go against the rules or purpose of the subreddit. I want motivation and answers for these big questions that plague all my friends attempts to quit usage. I am not a weed smoker but my friend is and I am on the behalf of him and with his permission am asking these questions. My friend has weed addiction but has these burning questions. He does not use Reddit nor wants to (idk why but it is what it is). He said he is open minded for change as an avid smoker (morning to night / all day, everyday). So please, some of these questions may be inscribed as presumptions but that is not the point, I am not here for any argument. I am here to be enlightened and forward this to my friend who I believe needs help. Tbh, I am questioning my life ahead of me with these questions. My whole thing in life prior to hearing these hard questions was to work hard, make a family, make a lot of money, and be strong - now, I am debating as to whether a life of just smoking weed all day, being happy and high all day, is what life is all about and is what the purpose of life is (to be as happy as possible).

**Questions:**

1. Is there a legit difference between a genuine happiness (EX: getting promoted at work) vs happiness on weed?

2. If life is all about being as happy as possible - then what is the purpose of quitting something that accomplishes that goal? Or in other words, if weed accomplishes this goal, then why remove it?

3. Are there genuine side effects when taking weed or are they just anti-drug propaganda? Basically, on other pro-weed subreddits, I constantly see this idea that weed is perfectly healthy, no to little side effects, and anything anti-weed is just propaganda.

4. Is it wasting time if you enjoyed it being high?

5. Why not enjoy life and use cannabis all day, everyday? This is assuming enjoying life equates to being high, do you consider these 2 things to correlate?

6. Is cannabis addiction really bad? In other words, regardless if question 3 is correct or wrong, then is cannabis addiction actually bad? Considering that alcoholism, cocaine addiction, drug addiction in general, and many others are bad and dangerous addictions - can cannabis addiction be grouped into this? This correlates to question 2, even if it is an addiction, what is the point of removing it.

7. As a non smoker and someone with a friend who is a heavy user, I feel jealous that I have not experienced this type of greatness. I have not tried it due to addiction. Am I justified for this and is there a way to stop my jealousy?

*I am not here for a debate, actually, the opposite - I am here to be enlightened and get your point of view. These are tuff questions but I have faith you all can answer them. I am honestly curious and I really don‚Äôt want this to be taken the wrong way as if I am attacking your progress or justification for combating weed addiction. I am proud of everyone of you and if I had an infinite amount of medals, I‚Äôd give everyone one of them on this subreddit.*

I originally posted on r/leaves with no response. I see so many people advocate weed and that smoking weed daily and even all day is not a bad thing. So please, me and my friend would love to hear all your answers.",6

I've watched one of my closest friends gradually  throw his life away. We grew up together...things weren't great for him growing up, his dad was abusive and an alcoholic. His mom left and never cared about him whenever he reached out to her. My other friend and I always tried to be there for him and  I always felt responsible for looking after him. Then my family moved away and we lost touch for about a year ish. We eventually reconnected and well these past years things just got progressively worse. He's been struggling with addiction for a few years now and he's pushed away everyone close to him. I've always tried to stick it out and be there for him whenever and however I could but today was too much. I'm just tired of seeing him do this to himself and lashing out at me , directing all his anger towards me and today I told him that until he decides to get better I can't do this anymore. He didn't even flinch. He was like "" k cool bye"". And I don't know who this person is anymore. I feel so guilty, like if I hadn't moved I could have prevented this somehow. I feel so helpless and I'm worried that he's now got no one to talk to. But I couldn't keep going like this. I feel so heartbroken and bad and I don't know how to fix this

I‚Äôm 25 years old, solidly middle class boring upbringing. Some very brief trauma but who doesn‚Äôt have that?

I‚Äôve struggled with bouts of depression on and off for years. Nothing major. 

Was never a drug user - I tried weed once or twice in college but that‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm mainly a cocktail girl. I‚Äôm married, I have a great job, nice friends, nice family.

And I‚Äôve never been so happy as when I tried cocaine.

It was 6 months ago and the best night and feeling I can ever remember having. I felt great. Everything was great. Life was exciting. 

No bad comedown the next day, still felt great.

Haven‚Äôt touched it since then (6 months ago!!) but it‚Äôs all I can think about. Every day, I pray for the opportunity to do it again. I‚Äôm too much of a wuss to buy it myself. I keep hoping a friend will offer it, or suggest it on a night out.

The way I‚Äôve responded to trying it ONCE makes me think I‚Äôm exactly the kind of person who should never do it again, but I want it. Life before and after has been so dull, so predictable, so meaningless, so devoid of enjoyment. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy for a year, I‚Äôve been on antidepressants, I exercise, I volunteer, I stay busy, I socialize, I‚Äôm working on another degree. I do everything I‚Äôm supposed to. But absolutely nothing is anywhere near as fulfilling as that night was.

How do you cope with that feeling? That nothing will ever be that enjoyable again?",3

All moments, every single one, both happening and not happening at once. I‚Äôd think about how relativity tells us that all of those moments, forever, are equally valid depending on the location and speed of the observer, and I‚Äôd imagine finding a spaceship and flying it a trillion miles away at the speed of light, and I‚Äôd wonder: having gotten this far away, could I look back towards the earth and see myself, finally happy, whether in the past or the future? Or maybe I‚Äôd see my parents, at their first dance.  Or my brother, when he was younger and still had a chance. Or maybe my sister, years in the future, having overcome her demons and fulfilled her potential. 

I‚Äôd imagine myself as one of the Tralfamadorians from that Kurt Vonnegut novel, these strange beings who live, and see, in all moments at once, and I‚Äôd wonder: what other moments of unbearable pain does my future hold, and can I do anything to change it, or is trying to change the future as futile as trying to change the past? 

Are all of my moments already chosen for me, and if I could stand outside existence for a moment, would I see myself as one of those strange beings - stretched and cascading through time - my first breaths forever and inextricably linked to my last, and all the moments in between as unalterable as any other physical fact of the universe? 

Are we trapped, forever, in the accumulated amber of this moment? And this one? And this? Are we nothing but the final sum of a million variables that we couldn‚Äôt even begin to comprehend, a million little choices that we didn‚Äôt even know we were making? Is there no great and final why? I don‚Äôt know the answer to that question, and it‚Äôs the lack of an answer that‚Äôs so fucking terrifying. 

But there has to be a way to overcome it. And for a long, long time, I thought that the answer was to brutalize myself with drug use, to get so fucked up that I didn‚Äôt have to think about certain things - my body: a hunk of flesh draped over a skeleton; my mind: a grey mass of goo, a soul trapped in a dying animal; my dad and his death and my mom and her life; my brother, alone and muttering to himself in his room; and my sister, drinking herself to sleep. 

It worked, for a while. It did. But then, of course, it didn‚Äôt anymore, and I‚Äôve been trying to find another way.",5

I know that it's very cheap he had gave me 70 mg vyvanse for $5 each previously and I was going to pay more but he said these are 5 mg each you have to be dumb to pay that much he said.

having so much dexedrine leads to abuse & addiction very quickly especially when you have low self-esteem. He became that bad we are used to look forward to waking up and taking it

My mom has been dealing with alcoholism for multiple decades. She drinks heavily everyday, and my sister and I have decided that we need to have an intervention now that she is leaving for college and my mom would be living alone. My dad lives on his own now, but said he would be present for the intervention/check-in to a facility.

My dad has tried to talk to my mom about her alcoholism in the past, but has had no success. She denies hiding wine glasses/bottles from everybody, drinking in the morning, etc.

We're getting her two to three closest friends involved in the intervention and plan on bringing proof (when my dad lived at home, he would take pictures of the levels of the wine bottles when he left for work in the early morning and came back around noon). We want her to check into a 90-day inpatient facility.

I expect it to be an absolute shit show, and I was hoping anybody who's had to do this in the past could give me tips about what they did that was effective, and what they wish they did differently.

I'm trying to find advice regarding how someone can re-integrate into society while dealing with (probable, but undiagnosed) brain injury due to prolonged drug and alcohol abuse. A brief history: her most active drug use was for a period of 3-4 years (from age 18 to 22) using meth, cocaine, MDMA, and heavy alcohol consumption (cocaine primarily for the first couple years then moving on to meth for at least the last year, with the others dispersed throughout this time based on availability and always coupled with heavy alcohol use). There were likely other drugs (various prescription drugs) included as well during this time and beforehand, since adolescence. She's been ""sober"" (unsubstantiated claim, but mostly believable) for 5 years from the meth/cocaine/MDMA, 3 years from alcohol. I found out she had been using a vape with DMT about 2 years ago (haven't heard anything about it since), and know that she still has access to marijuana from time to time. She's been unemployed for the past 3 years due to extreme depression coupled with what I can only describe as debilitating ADHD symptoms, though these were never a problem before. These include being clumsy and prone to accidents, cannot manage (or sometimes even conceive of) time to get ready to leave the house or perform simple chores (claims cooking meals, cleaning a one-bedroom apartment, and walking 2 dogs takes up her entire day, every day), is extremely paranoid (new and worsening conspiratorial beliefs), speaks very quickly and kind of mumbles/slurs her words (think Boomhauer from KOTH) cannot plan nor execute anything meaningful and gets confused/frustrated easily. I initially attributed this behavior to post-acute withdrawal syndrome but now that it's been so long since she quit the really hard stuff and has now even abandoned the softer stuff for a considerable length of time, I think there may be something deeper going on. I've found all of these symptoms consistent with the symptoms of brain damage resulting from drug abuse as reported by multiple addiction counseling agencies and have come to the conclusion that in order to help her we need to get her in to see some kind of neurologist. Since she's been unemployed for so long she doesn't have any insurance but for some reason doesn't qualify for Medicaid. So after that not-so-brief-after-all explanation, my questions are: Does anyone here know of an organization who could help us? Are there any programs focused on diagnosis, treatment, and reintegration? Has anyone been through treatment for substance abuse induced brain damage or known someone who has been? Is recovery even possible at this point? We're in San Antonio, Texas. I've been looking for programs but am having a hard time finding anything affordable for former addicts, and absolutely nothing as far as neurological testing/studies for the same demographic. Any and all suggestions/anecdotes/referrals are very much appreciated. Thanks IA.",3

I want to preface this with saying anonymously... I received As and Bs in high school. I made sergeant (E-5) in the Marine Corps infantry and deployed twice. I had a perfect physical fitness score and was an expert rifleman. I am in college now and have been on the Dean's list for my first year and have been promoted at my part-time job twice. I feel that when I put my mind to something I can achieve anything. I have a looming sadness and angry feeling inside me in part from my own doing, and in part from past trauma (family drug issues/overdoses, an instance of sexual abuse, and the general violence and bullying that comes with being a boy). I have a beautiful girlfriend and have had a (like I said I'm not boasting, being honest) a very good sex life and have great friends. When I get the craving to drink or become stressed when I can't.... I cannot rationalize it in my head. When it started I felt that when I drank... I could turn off the Corporal and Sergeant in my head and forget painful memories, and that even though I missed my family, my girlfriend and my friends it felt ok if I just had a few drinks and reached out to my old buddies or video chatted my girlfriend.

&#x200B;

The thing that's driving me crazy is many people talk about how I'm naturally gifted, or smart, or insinuating I have everything figured out at such a young age. But I don't, I feel like they're all fooled and it's getting to the point I want to break down, I want someone to notice and it's causing me to engage in self-harming behavior but that's not who I want to be, but I can't disappoint the people who believe in me. I drink about a fifth of hard liquor a day and if you walked past me, you wouldn't even notice. We'd have a great conversation, share ideas, talk about culture, politics, current events etc. and you'd be none the wiser... but inside I'm really hurting man. It gives me a slight sense of relief that at least here I can anonymously share this with you guys because I don't have the heart to disappoint the people who think highly of me.

&#x200B;

For those who made it to the end of this, love ya guys. Stay strong.",5

Is it normal to still feel mild withdrawals?,"As the title reads, I'm clean from opioids (mainly tramadol) going on two weeks. I used opioids daily for about 2 years and at my most severe I was taking around 400mg-500mg but tapered down significantly from there until I was done with them completely. I'm still feeling mild withdrawals as of today especially at the time of day when I would usually take a pill. Is this normal? Has anyone else experienced this or is this some sort of phantom/pseudo feeling I'm having?

I really appreciate the input.",2

I was so so close. I relapsed a few weeks ago on other stuff but I didn't drink. I was sure tonight was my breaking point. I've been to 2 zoom meetings tonight. I feel so hopeless. But, I am glad I didn't drink. Tonight is the first night of me starting to live alone. I've come too far to mess it up now. I've just earned back my family's trust that I won't hurt myself. I have to prove that I can do this and drinking makes my suicidal thinking way way worse. I'm putting one foot in front of the other to battle this.",1

I had actually been looking forward to getting better long-term so much. This sucks. I just can't last more than a few weeks on my own and for the first time had a plan talked through with my doctor and counsellors that I felt really confident would work out. None of them even mentioned the possibility of the application getting rejected, because we all agreed that this was the most logical step. Guess a random insurance lady knows better. I'll call my counsellor on monday to see how I can object, but I don't think there's much of a chance. Just needed to vent a bit, thanks for reading",5

At first it felt like ""if every dudes does it, is it really that bad"". But then I got from porn videos, to porn chat with strangers on twitter. Every fucking time, I hated myself once it was over, every fucking time I thought to myself ""this is the last time"" and every fucking time I fell for it again.
Until yesterday. While I was at work my girlfriend used my computer to go to her Twitter account, she found mine. She left. She took all her stuff and left me with a message, telling how much I was an asshole and that it was over.
I know I deserve every last piece of it, but it hurts so much. She's the only person I need in my life and she left, and I'm the reason for it.
On Monday I'll start the process of healing, I'll go to specialized places where they will help me. But until then, I'm alone with all these things, I fucking hate myself guys",2

This is not about me. This one is about my uncle. My dad died from a police shootout, or suicide by police a little while back. He was on meth, coke, muscle relaxers, from what the autopsy said. When my uncle used to live with us while I was growing up, he fell into addiction along with my dad. At the time it was pills(relaxers mostly), crack, and coke. My uncle then had an old girlfriend fly out, they got serious, and he moved away to then have a daughter, and a while after another. It seemed they were as happy as could be. Over the past couple years he and his wife have been addicted to pills entirely. However recently they have gotten into meth after another family death. 

He has told me stories recently of his daughter not being able to wake either of them up from how toasted they were. It's an extremely similar situation to a lot of my childhood and my father.

I'm honestly worried that my uncle is gonna end up like my father addiction wise, and I'm worried about his daughters. I don't want anyone to go through the things I have. 

I need my uncle in my life, he's always there to talk to like my father was. I want to talk to him about stopping, but no matter what I can't break his trust, I don't have many people left, and the ones not dead just aren't there except him. Anytime I think about his daughters, I think about little me, and how fast that shit made me grow up. Every kid deserves a childhood.

My husband and I have been together for almost seven years now. Married for two. The first year of our relationship was great, we had a baby and a very normal life. Then we both tried coke one night while at a bar, and thus opened the door to our addictions. We were doing 2-3 eight balls of blow a week, for a solid 6 months. Then hubs lost his job, and boom. Couldn't afford our habit. Switched to meth, and that's where our life really fell apart. The first year I had myself under somewhat control. Very recreational. Could pick it up and put it down. Actually hated the high and my ROA but felt like my disdain towards it helped me keep it in check (delusional AF) hubs on the other hand, took control or him pretty quickly. After years of using, we've lost everything. Our children, homes, cars, jobs, etc. And basically each other. Addiction has basically turned my husband and I into strangers. What used to be a past time of sex, closeness, etc has now turned into us tweaking on opposite sides of the couch for hours upon end and/or violent outbursts on each other. Meth has drove me mentally ill, and turned me into a woman my husband cant stand. We had got some Heroin (unintentionally...lomg story the dealer gave us the wrong bag of shit, but whatever ) and us high on Heroin for two days have been the most loving and seemingly ""normal"" that we have been in over a year. Which is sad as fuck  It breaks my heart. We're going to rehab on Sunday. Not our first rodeo, but we can get out kids back if we take this serious. And I am. I miss being a mom. I miss being happy. I miss being a loving and caring wife. I miss having a fucking life outside of these substances. I miss living. But I'm scared of what it's like to live sober. But I know I can do it ..
