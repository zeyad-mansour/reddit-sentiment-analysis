Within the game Roblox, there is a game where you put up booths and can name the booth. You can also put up a picture the left side of the booth. This will become important later. Anyway, the fact you can put up pictures is what bothers me. Some how, a picture of child pornography, what looks to be a little girl being raped, some how got through the filter on Roblox. I found this in r/GoCommitDie, a cursed comments subreddit, but Roblox. Another thing I found is the same game where they use a picture of an H followed by entai.  
  
When I saw it, it hadn’t affected my porn addiction. In fact, I had reported it to Roblox to have it removed. Recently, I been having nightmares and thoughts of child porn. I’ve been trapped in my nightmares, witnessing cartoons of child pornography and the such. The thoughts of giving in and relapsing. I hate the feeling.",1

While he stopped he developed a sex addiction (he began relationships with women from the sex addicts meetings). As a human being I feel for him. I asked him why did you do all this. He said if he doesn’t do one thing he will do the other because he has crazy thoughts and has to keep occupied. So he said if he didn’t seek that out from the women he would start gambling or Vice versa if he gambles then he won’t seek out women. So he’s turning one addiction for the other. I joined him in some of the meetings. I know it has helped some people, but was thinking are these meetings more of a distraction and don’t really get to the root of the problem? It seemed like more of a social event and not long term solution. Does anyone have any success with addiction that isn’t in some anonymous meeting form?

4. Wacky dreams / night mares
5. Fatigue
6. Weed cravings
7. Depression/anxiety 
8. Malaise

     If you got to the sight  [the wisdom of trauma . Com] (I don’t know if I can post links so I posted it like that) it’s back up and I believe it’s free but they as for a donation. I’m half way through it and damn is it interesting.

I am finally free from the shackles of marijuana addiction.,"I started smoking in the 9th grade and developed a dependence to it by senior year of high school. In college it got so bad that I would regularly skip class just to smoke. My grades slipped and I lost my financial aid as well as flunked out of college. I kept telling myself that it was just weed and that it had nothing to do with my studies. I kept making excuses as to why weed was harmless. I found myself deeply addicted to the point where I could not go one day without smoking. It was a part of my daily routine. Like coffee, I would have to smoke in the morning and several blunts throughout the day then one to go to sleep. This routine continued till age 24. Last year I fell into a deep depression, and didn’t realize it was weed that was making my depression worse. It caused me to overthink about my my failures in life but it did not help me do anything to change my situation. I saw a lot of my friends graduate and get good  jobs while I was still working a 9-5 and using the money to support my addiction. I wasted so much time and money looking for weed, buying weed, blunts, papers, etc that I was mad that my finances were not doing anything of value for me. I loved fashion but complained that I couldn’t afford clothes because I spent all my money on weed. I loved art but complained that I couldn’t afford art supplies because I spent all my money on weed. I also felt like weed worsened my social anxiety. So much to the point where  I was so terrified of people that I would rather stay home, smoke weed and watch movies all day. My self esteem went down the drain because I would constantly overthink my appearance but made no action to improve my appearance. Anyway fast forward to January 2021, my siblings and parents had an intervention with me and I stopped smoking for the whole month of January. During that month I went back to school and got straight A’s during my first semester. I forgot that I was actually smart before I started smoking weed. I worked hard and started dreaming again. I took interest in my favorite hobbies again. I bought clothes, and even picked up lessons to play guitar. I started to love myself more, I was more confident. I felt less sleepy and tired all the time. I had more energy to do things. I took action. Honestly quitting weed has been the best decision of my life. And I actually relapsed the other day but I hated being high. It didn’t feel as good as the first time. And I had no desire to smoke again. I think I’m at the end of my addiction because I genuinely do not like smoking anymore and I’m high on life. I feel like a kid again where everything is new and interesting. I’m currently on my 4th semester of school and have a 3.8 GPA. I have more money to go on vacation and buy the stuff I love and doing things that genuinely make me happy. I’m so grateful for this life now.",75

Knowledge is not always power.  Ignorance is indeed, sometimes bliss.  Where I am going with this disjunctive  trainwreck of bad cliches is that one should not always be so quick to judge another, based on their use or non-use of substances, their race, their religion, their mental health conditions etc. etc. I grew up with the very backwards belief that ALL DRUGS ARE BAD, ALL PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS ARE BAD, YOU WILL END UP ON THE STREET AND HOMELESS IF YOU USE DRUGS.

Well guess what? Ma? Pa?  You were WRONG and RIGHT.  I am indeed about to be homeless since you have passed but that's because I have so gratefully decided to finally sell this amazing house that we built together.  Why am I selling my house you ask?  You being the reader who thinks I am on a lot of drugs....?  Well I am on a lot of drugs you are right about that, but its not monetary reasons, in fact its because **I HATE SPECTRUM**.  **I LITERALLY AM MOVING SOLELY BECAUSE I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE MOST GODLESS, SOULELESS, PIECE OF SHIT CORPORATION THAT HAS EVER EXISTED.  I CANNOT STAND THE FACT YOU HAVAE A MONOPOLY OVER WHAT I NEED THE MOST IN LIFE AND WHICH YOU HANG OVER MY HEAD WORSE THAN ANY PERSON I EVER DATED IN MY LIFE.**

I literally HATE this company more than my perception of whether or not I am drug 'addicted'.  I cannot access the internet in my house.  I have tried for MONTHS to get it fixed, but I cannot, and it has driven me to the point of absolute madness.  I am almost certainly on at least 5-10 watchlists for the things I have said(hey this post aint getting brighter mfers, more lists for me).  But seriously, you want to know what's very very bad for an insecure drug using 3X professional who is stuck working from home because a bunch of morons dont know how to get vaccinated?  Well, its having no internet, no ability to do the things they need to do to keep their mind sharp and focused.  Now, I stare at a screen that says Loading Holding Waiting Fixing Think of every -ing that you can and insert it onto an electronic screen.  That is the status of my life..  Spectrum you are KILLING ME.  I drown myself to sleep every night in my self sorrow and lack of self-worth because well hey, i used to watch tv before bed now I cannot connect any of my mfing sh\*t to the internet to use.

TLDR: Not everyone who uses drugs is a giant piece of shit;  yes I am an addict, I know i have problems, but I think my biggest problem is a lack of self worth which stems from my parents preaching WAY too hard that drugs automatically lead one to addiction and failure, which IMHO is not true.

P.S. Mom and dad are not dead.  They are dead to me in an abstract way, in my heart, because of how they make me feel sometimes.  (Psss we got into a huge fight about me wanting to remodel and fix half of what they built) While I am not bragging about living with rents in my 30s, actually and technically, I don't live with my rents, they live with me.  Hey if you're paying the mortgage, and title is in your MFing name its your MFing house?! You dont need to answer that.. I already know the answer... 

This was meant to straddle the line between comedic, truthful, and thought provoking.  I am sure I have failed at all three and for that I apologize..  I think reddit and its users are some of the rudest mofos on the face of the planet soooo I am going to probably go smoke some <insert DOC> with T, my local homeless friend, whom I had a GIANT beef with, but then we got to talking and we squashed it.

She confessed she is using everyday or every second day. When she takes a break it’s because she’s out of money or her body just crashes. I used the flash light and It illuminated a cave of black bloody scabbing. There’s no medial septum. Her sinuses are gone. She doesn’t smell anything. It’s picked at and painful looking. But she said no pain when she’s picking it and getting “boogers” out. She refuses to get help or support. I don’t know where to even begin. 
She showed me this because I told her about a vivid dream I had of her the night before. Part of her face was picked off and rotting, but she was trying to reassure me it was “ok”. 
 I feel like she may die from picking all her flesh out. Or she’ll have a stroke. She last did 2 grams in a day. Crashed for 18 hours and is back at it because it’s how she feels normal. Her new normal. What she thinks is coke is probably half meth. Or entirely meth.  She numbs her pain with it.

I am afraid he will overdose again and looking for advice on how to help.","My boyfriend is an addict and he doesn't realize. I never judged him for his drugabuse and accepted it as a part of him because I love him unconditionally. But how far can I go? How far can he go? It is slowly ruining our relationship and I am afraid of what he is able to do to himself or to others.

He is taking drugs every single day. When I say drugs, I don't even count the weed that he smokes since rolling joints is his main activity during the morning, afternoon and evening. He became a dealer and is basically using everything that he can find and is offered to him.He is now using for sure weed (daily), cocaine (almost daily), ketamine (almost daily), Mdma (weekly), LSD (weekly) and since we live in a country where things are not always pure I am sure also meth is within some of the things he takes.

I realize that he finds it really difficult to deal with the hard aspects of life and even harder to reflect on himself. Ever since we started living apart from each other and his mom is diagnosed with terminal cancer, things became worse.

I feel like a human punch-ball since I am the closest to him and always get to deal with his mood-swings and anger-attacks. He is living in such a dissociative state that he leaves with other woman sometimes or has crazy black-outs. I almost saw him die of overdose two times in the past year and it is devastating for me to see that he does not care about his own body and does not believe there are people like me who care about him so much.

But how can you help someone that says: ""I take these drugs because I really like it"", someone who makes jokes about being an addict but does not see the problem in it, someone who has no clue of who he is and can be because he has been living in a different world over the last 10 years of his life.

When I make a remark about the amount of drugs he uses he tells me that maybe he can't be with me if I won't accept him. I feel like he has completely no motivation to stay away from anything since this is his coping mechanism. There is no way he can express his feelings and is always on the defense.

I love my boyfriend a lot, even through all the pain he caused me. I still see him as a beautiful person, but I have no idea how to help him. I am thinking now that maybe breaking up would be the best idea to motivate him to hit rock bottom and hopefully change his ways and live a better life. But I am scared that things will take a 180 and he will overdose again.

We live in Mexico and he is from a Mexican family. There is no budget for therapy. If anyone can give me any advice that would be very much appreciated. I don't know that much about addiction, how it feels and how patterns of addicts can be. Anyone in similar situations or people with addictions that can let me know how they would like to be treated by their girlfriend in this situation?",3

I haven’t really been properly productive in 2 years. Basically, if not playing 2 games at the same time, while maybe listening to music, then I’m probably not stimulated enough.

That is independent of whether I’m taking my adhd “medication” or not. I’m currently prescribed 5 mg of Dexedrine as a “taper”, but I’m trying to quit cold turkey. I stopped using for about 2 weeks, and replaced it with nicotine patches. That kind of worked for a while. In addition, I tried to gradually spend more time not doing anything that I find very stimulating, like walking, listening to music or an audiobook, meditate, introspect, chores... etc. I was doing 6+ hours a day of that. However, my ability to perform productive activities, specifically one’s that required sitting down like studying, and basically applying for jobs, didn’t really improve.
So I decided to start 2-weeks minimum dopamine detox; essentially, I can’t do anything that gives instant gratification. I’m currently on day 2. I relapsed yesterday. I rationalized it by thinking that this dopamine detox is like extra-hard for me because of my amphetamine dependence, and that even with the 5 mg dexedrine, it’s still going to be extra-hard because this is the lowest dose, and it’s the ir version. I thought that I should perhaps aim to first increase my ability to be productive while on this low dose, and then actually quit. 

Once the dexedrine runs off, I start feeling extremely restless in my arms and legs, I just want to fidget. I can’t even think properly. I’m struggling to write this post because the craving for stimuli is killing me. I don’t know how many more days this is going to last, but I’d like to know how to cope with it. I wish I could be put into a medically induced coma right now; it’s incredibly nerve wracking. Thank fuck it doesn’t happen at night. 


TL;DR: I’m trying to discipline my dopamine addicted brain by doing a “dopamine detox” (i.e. not doing anything that gives instant gratification), but the restlessness I feel in my legs and arms is just so nerve wracking. How do I cope?",4

I feel like a hypocrite saying I'm in recovery whole still being addicted to smoking. It's been causing me a lot of grief lately. Nicotine is no where near the drug heroin is but it still bothers me that I am chained to a substance.

I don't feel healthy and I want to quit. This reminds me of the times during active addiction where I felt nothing but self pity and always put off quiting until ""tomorrow"".

I wrote a list of the things I would feel during the withdrawls, the excuses I would make to continue and finally the benefits of quitting last night. I woke up this morning and simply disregarded all of those rules and lit up. I feel pathetic. Has nothing changed through out my recovery?

I am going to try to quit again tomorrow (I'm worried that this is a lie). I've felt the pains of withdrawal and I know these withdrawals won't be nearly as bad but I'm terrified. Will my suicidal ideation return? Will I relapse on heroin? Will I snap at someone I love?

I've gotten through so much in my life and I know I can do it but that doesn't make it any easier. I'd love to sugar coat things and say that recovery has made life nothing but sunshine and rainbows but that simply isn't true. I struggle every single day.

Does anyone have any advice / tips?",1
2021-07-29 20:15:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ou9r3f/that_moment_when_you_fully_admit_to_yourself_that/,That moment when you fully admit to yourself that you're an addict,"Let me start by saying this: I've fucked with drugs since I was 16 or 17 (a late bloomer for some). My first drug was Vicodin, back in the day when everyone's grandma and grandpa was thrown huge bottles of painkillers. I hadn't even tried weed yet—the Vicodin I was given by my mom for my braces pain and I mixed them up with Tylenol.

I've been battling a Xanax addiction for a year, after years on and off it but never approaching the addicted barrier, just taking it occasionally, and it's definitely gotten worse the last few months after my abusive relationship ended (we were together and I realized I was self-medicating before seeing him because I was scared of whether it was gonna be a good night or not with him, so I definitely got worse once we started dating). I'm trying to get off it now, but it feels like prison. I can get through it but I'm leaving for Ukraine in a few days and I'm fiending because I haven't gotten the Valium I was supposed to get to help me get off the Xanax. I go through the Xans so fast it'll be a week and I'll be like where tf did the huge amount (that I'm even embarrassed to admit how much I bought) go. Realizing I'm probably not gonna get through this on my own. My parents are gonna be there for the first two weeks and I'm thinking this may be my best chance to finally go to rehab while I'm abroad on my own for a couple months after my parents leave, or at least to detox, because last time I went of xans it was cold turkey and I had two grand mal seizures in one day.

I've managed to convince all my doctors that I don't abuse drugs at all, even got a Briviact script (anticonvulsant for epilepsy that's actually Schedule V controlled substance for some reason), got a gabapentin script, and about 30 bars that I'll burn through unless I actually try to control myself and deal with some anxiety to make them last longer, along with 25 prescribed 1mg xans. Without the valium though, I'm fucked. My withdrawal in January was hell, and I'm realizing I have to go through it again.

I'm not really looking for advice, just depressed at how bad it got and how I somehow lost track of how bad it got that I'm fiending so I won't be in the worst of withdrawal while I'm abroad. It's a really hopeless feeling to wake up every morning and feel like you can't get out of bed or do *anything* until that xanax hits. Staying in the States, I could stock up as much as I want,, and in Ukraine they're probably lax (and corrupt enough) that I could get my hands on whatever I wanted if I looked around enough, especially because the city I'm from is a huge drug capital. I don't really do anything else regularly besides benzos. It's just a hard fucking thing to admit to yourself that you're a prisoner to this addiction, and to not know what to do. Last time I almost got through the worst of the hell and relapsed. I want to get off for good. I don't know how any of you did it.

Idk, just wanted to see if anyone here ever felt this way. It's weird to go from feeling high from something to feeling like you're only normal when you're on it.",3

Tl;dr: Currently at rock bottom -- drank a tipplewear container of diarrhea in a closet at a party while high on various opiates. R/opiatesrecovery banned me for this post

As the title says: I've relapsed with fetanyl and heroin a month ago and two nights ago I've entered what I think is my rock bottom.


Was at a party using and drank diarrhea which was in a basket in the hosts' closet. Not really any explanation as to why I did this other than I was exceptionally high and strung out.
Yes I am currently using but have been calling in sick from work for the past two days and will probably be fired. Idk. 



Is this my rock bottom? 

Edit: a lot of people are asking why was there a basket of diarrhea in your friend's closet and I don't have an explanation for that other than he is a methanphetamine user. Also I'd never before done something like this.

Smoking methamphetamine is probably the quickest way into the mind of an abuser. For those who simply want to get high, smoking the drug will almost seem like a very good idea. However, it often causes more drastic changes to the mind that can result in meth addiction. The following are the most severe side effects of smoking meth.

One of the more serious side effects of smoking meth is psychosis. Those who abuse this drug often experience moments of madness that often lead them to do things they would not normally do. Psychosis is often accompanied by paranoia, which causes the abuser to feel that everyone around them is a threat. Some meth addicts have even committed homicide over the thought that someone might harm them while on the drug. The most severe symptoms of psychosis often include delusions and hallucinations, which are signs of full-blown meth addiction that need to be discussed with a doctor.

While meth may be a relatively mild addictive substance, it is also highly addictive in its pure form. When taken in small doses, it is not likely to cause any serious addiction or physical damage. In comparison, [smoking meth](https://www.americandrugrehabs.com/meth-overdose/) at its most concentrated level is an incredibly destructive habit. People who abuse prescription drugs or street drugs are far more likely to wind up in the north Jersey recovery center.

Many users start out smoking meth as just a ""kick"", but often end up using in secret as a ""get rich quick"" scheme. This often starts out with small amounts that are smoked and gradually increases over time. Some who begin as occasional smokers may wind up being addicted to the drug in its most potent form. If you have become addicted to smoking meth mouth, you will want to seek help for your addiction. You will want to get your life back in order so that you can move forward with your life.

The recovery center will treat you for any signs of meth addiction including smoking meth, using the bathroom after using, and losing all of your money. If you do use or do not use meth, you may still have a problem. The counselor at the center will evaluate you based on your symptoms and any history of addiction to other substances. Once you have received treatment for your addiction, you can find a new way of thinking and dealing with your problems that have been plaguing you. You can also learn to share and communicate effectively with other people, which will give you back your confidence and self-esteem.

The dangers of smoking meth are great. It destroys your brain chemistry and severely impairs your judgment. However, many people smoke it socially or even recreationally. Many people just need a place to smoke to relax. With Methadone maintenance, you can stop having the dangerous side effects and enjoy your life back again.",1

2021-07-28 14:59:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/otghve/finally_quitting_my_morphin_addiction/,Finally quitting my Morphin addiction,"I was addicted to heroin for decades, until i managed to get clean in 2018. In the beginning of 2021, i relapsed on morphin (200mg capsules, but de-retarted for consume). After some months, i started to preparing for getting clean again with a plan: Getting the dosage down, small step by step instead of going cold turkey withdrawal.

So i lowered the dosage with lines (nasal) first, always taking less than the day before. In June, i switched to the capsules again, this time with the retarded long-time ones: I refilled the opened, empty capsules myself with always a smaller amount of morphin for everyday. With the retarded effect, i didn't get any kick, flash, anymore in the end, but it prevented withdrawal-effects.

Now, took the last one and today, i'm off and don't have any morphin in my system. Because my last dosage was so small, i don't experience any real withdrawal effects on the body yet. No cold turkey, no feeling sick, no shaking of the hands, feeling hot/cold switching etc.

Still, i notice in my mind, that it is different: Lack the energy and motivation to do something. The world feels cold without opioids, all seems to be dark and gray. I know this will effects will fade away in a few days, it will not be that bad. It's like when it is night, you can only wait for the sun to rise in the morning, there's nothing you can do to get the sun rise up earlier.

It's not that bad, but still, as we all know, the risk of relapsing is always there when we are or were once addicted. I also planned ahead by leaving some last capsules in the hands of a friend (which is not an user), to make sure i could go back if there would be something unexpected (like an emergency etc.). I also got reserves like temesta (lorazepam) and rohypnol (flunitrazepam) if i would have problems with things like sleeping or anxiety.

Wish me luck to get through the very last days of becoming clean. 

P.S.  
If you're addicted and you want to become clean, better go my way with reduction of the dosage before you finally kick the stuff off. Cold Turkey is brutal and the risk of relapsing is much bigger. Don't torture yourself for no gain, better plan ahead and do it step by step over a long time instead of trying to get clean in just a few days on the hard way.",8

I am an 18 yo male and I've been probably smoking weed almost about everyday for the last two years. I would say I'm addicted, dependent, or whatever you want to call it. It's honestly not making that big of a deal in my life. I can notice some mental affects the and my lack of cognitive abilities. I did perfectly fine in school until my senior year where I struggled a bit. What I'm worried about is not putting my best foot forward going to college. I don't really want to smoke weed. I mean I love the feeling and it makes go from not alright to alright, but I feel trapped that I smoked so much I ended up becoming dependent. I want to be able to have a chance in college and I'm worried about my bad habits messing me up. I've tried a few times to stop smoking but by the time I get the weekend my friends have already convinced me. I know it's easier to control your environments than to control yourself but where I live I have access to it 24/7. I have to learn some sort of self control but not sure how to. For God's same I used to weigh over 305 pounds and lost 120. I can do that but I can't control myself to stop smoking. Any help is appreciated I'm sure I'll figure it out but I just needed to seek advice",2

At least when I was taking (low dose, under 5g daily) Kratom I wanted to go out, meet people, network, talk, be focused, have energy etc... I would go out of my way to talk to people, or even complete a task

When I get into my marijuana addiction cycle, my brain feels retarded (even day after), which leads me to not wanting to / being unable to socialize, get things done, go out, hold focus... low energy, low motivation etc... even having a basic conversation can be tough. 

The main difference is that kratom held a physical dependance while weed does not. Yes weed may be fairly benign in a lot of ways, but I think the effects make me straight up dumb.  So is kratom worth the dependance?

I come from a broken home. Until my parent's divorce both of them went to church. After that it was one man after another with my mom. As a result I struggled to really to trust and let people in. I was lonely growing up. Basically living isolated from people my own age except when I was in school. As a result I ended up with porn and the things that go with it, which just made me depressed and feel guilty. I ended up trying suicide a few times. The last time I realized after I had taken the stuff that I didn't want to die. I asked God to spare me and He did. Praise God. I never even got sick from it. A great peace just came over me and I fell asleep. I still struggled after that with my addictions and the temptation is still there, but thank God I don't have to live that way anymore. I went through a time of  rebellion later on in life and  only God kept me from giving in to sex. Thank God! I listened to the wrong people and did some bad things. But God is a merciful God.  After a while I realized that wasn't what I wanted to live like.  I Thank God that He is a merciful God! I have been trying to live for Him, but I still make many  mistakes.  God is a forgiving God and I praise Him for His mercy. I am nothing without Him. All the glory and honor go to God!!!

God can do the same for you! He can set you free fro your sins! Praise God!

The Gospel: What It Is?

We believe the general plan of salvation is best accepted and taught in the following manner:

◾The Bible teaches that all human beings are sinners (Roman 3:10; Isaiah 64:6; Romans 3:23; James 2:10; Jeremiah 17:9).

◾The Bible teaches that the penalty of sin  in is death (Romans 6:23; Ezekiel 18:20).

◾The Bible teaches that a person must be perfect and righteous in God’s eyes to enter heaven (Revelation 21:27).

◾The Bible teaches that all sinners can do nothing of themselves to obtain this perfection/righteousness (Ephesians 2:8,9; Galatians 2:21; Romans 4:5).

◾The Bible teaches how God provided a Sin-bearer or Sin-Purger and imputes to you His own righteousness (2 Corinthians 5:21; Philippians 3:9, Isaiah 53:6; 1 Peter 3:18).

◾The Bible teaches that people need only belief/faith/trust (BELIEVING) on Jesus Christ ALONE on His blood atonement for eternal salvation (John 1:12, 3:14-18, 36, 14:6, 19:30, 4:10-12, 8:37, 15:1-11, 16:30-31; Ephesians 2:8-9; 1 Corinthians 15:1-9; Revelation 5:9). 

◾The Bible teaches that a person can be certain of their eternal salvation now, and that their eternal salvation CANNOT be lost, because eternal/everlasting life is eternal which has NO ENDING (John 6:37-39; John 10:26-28; 1 Peter 1:5; Hebrews 10:10-14; 1 John 5:13).",2

However, there is one thing that accompanies addiction that people don’t really realize or talk about, and it is very sinister.

Addicts can grow up, get sober, and still act like immature teenagers because their addiction has stunted their emotional growth. My friend’s mother has been an alcoholic since she was 16 years old, she’s 48 now. Her daughter (my friend) tells me that she’s the type of person who would throw tantrums in public, start drama over the smallest things, would always switch between friends, and never committed to a relationship. Unfortunately, her mother has refused therapy multiple times, and appears to be stuck in her situation. The more you run away from your problems with drugs, the less opportunity you have to confront your demons and grow. 

I’ve told this to a handful of people, but I don’t think they realize how serious this is. This could impact a person into making stupid decisions that could haunt them for the rest of their life, all because they were operating like a teenager when they’re fully grown adults.

If you’re mom is 50, and she has emotional growth problems due to past addictions, a child will likely suffer with them well into their adulthood. It is like babysitting a teenager, and it is exhausting. 

Characteristics of individuals suffering from emotional immaturity include impulsivity, a lack of financial resources, a long list of short-lived jobs, and serious relationship issues. 

I’m sharing this because it isn’t talked about enough, I’ve never crossed the road to addiction and for that I’m very thankful. To all you addicts/former addicts, I hope this post taught you something and I wish you the best in your journey. <3",6

His career. His job. His longtime girlfriend. His son. His home. His dreams. Most of his family.

How do I help without enabling? 

I love him dearly. He’s my little brother. The only time he reaches out is when he wants something. He sends me long heartbreaking text messages as to why he needs a place to stay or why he needs to borrow money. I don’t send him money anymore. I know where it will go. He blew all his stimulus checks the same day he got them. He has been asking me where I live so he can come visit the kids (we recently moved) and I have had to ignore his messages. I do not want him over because he uses drugs in our bathroom. He says he isn’t but he will spend hours in there and I literally have to bang on the door to wake him up. He does this every time. I have kids. I can’t have this around them. He’s homeless but lately has been sleeping in my mom’s storage closet. 

I care so much. I honestly feel like he won’t live much longer and I don’t want him to die thinking I didn’t care. We lost our dad as teenagers and he was never the same. He knows he has a problem but does not want help. He has made it clear. He said he doesn’t care if he dies. My whole family has told him he needs help but he refuses. I am heartbroken but nothing I can say or do will change his mind. 

Do I really just cut him out of my life? I don’t want to, but anything I do is enabling him at this point. My kids love him. I love him. I just don’t know how I can be there for him.",34

It was through a doctor and was for ADHD. I took them and it helped a lot. I remember being prescribed 5mg and feeling amazing. Total change. Even helped my depression.

Then time passed and without having good parents or guidance in life, I thought naively to myself ""what if I take two?"". And so on it went.

In 2020 I used street speed and regret it so much. Worst hallucinations of my life. I am lucky I didn't kill myself or someone else tbh.

But I'm 14 months clean but still am using 50mg Dexedrine XR daily. Problem is I don't feel much from it and I tend to try to use more. Up to 150mg. It's ridiculous. Most days though I just use 40-80 mg.

There's a problem. I get psychosis and agitation and delusions when I stop cold turkey. I have a clonazepam script now, so that might help. But I don't know if I can wean off the drugs on my own. If they give me so much when I pick up, I'm always going to be tempted to use more, not less.

Plus I feel I need the drug. But since fifty mg is the max dose where I live, I can't keep going like this.

Any advice on getting off Dexedrine? The withdrawals are horrible and bring me into psychosis ( I have had schizophrenia diagnosed for five years too, thought I would mention that at the end as to not get dismissed, the drug addiction came after my initial psychotic episode)

Any tips! Please. Thanks.",2

Basically I am struggling with sex addiction. It’s very easy for me to get sucked into it, and I have compulsive and obsessive thoughts especially if I am not satisfied. The sex addiction includes escorts (2-3 a week, ~£300 p/m), cybersex Skype(fetish I.e femdom foot fetish kink - another couple hundred added). 

Basically I get the rush leading up to it, enjoy it in the moment, followed by regret, then do it again, and again. I have an insatiable appetite. Usually I’m feeling this way but particularly low tonight. 

My main guilt comes at the amount of money I spend on this, I feel it is not in control 

I have tried private therapy but I just felt I was repressing my urges, and I didn’t feel I was getting anywhere. I really don’t know the best solution to be at peace and happy and healthy.

I mean, some parents are addicted to heroin, or cocaine, etc. And at first, it wasn’t a big deal to me, since I smoke occasionally, like at parties or very rarely when I’m alone at home (I’m 20 btw). I don’t have any problems regarding weed at all, I’m all in favor of legalization and I think it’s good for medicinal purposes too (even though that’s CBD). But then I realized that he smokes not one, two times a day, but around more than 6 times. I don’t think there’s a single minute where he’s not high. And I noticed he’s getting more and more forgetful each day, it’s getting annoying.

 

I talk to him about something and the next second he already forgot what I talked about. It doesn’t help that he has ADHD as well and not getting treatment because he doesn’t want to, and thinks weed is going to solve his problems. He’s also high when he drives with me, and even though is not very dangerous it still is dangerous. He gets very stressed and angry if he doesn’t smoke, and now when I notice he’s completely out of his mind while high, I get very annoyed and not even talk to him. Maybe I’m being harsh but I don’t know what to do. He goes to a therapist, I talked to her but she told me that I should be the one talking to him about it.

 

I tried to, but he gets really mad and defensive and ignores completely whatever I say. I even try to show him scientific information about it but he won’t listen. I have my own mental illnesses to care about and he knows how I feel about him smoking and how it makes me sad and annoyed. He says he cares about me but it doesn’t look like it. Every day about 6 times a day the smell of weed impregnates my brain, gives me headaches and I spend most of the days locked in my room. It sucks because it’s weed, I’m supposed to be “cool” about it, not a “square”. I don’t know sometimes I just feel like i’m exaggerating or being dramatic.

My brother is 21 and developed a serious drug addiction after I joined. It is destroying my family. I'm unsure to the total extent of his addiction, but it is deep. He told me he spends about $160 a day on pills; pain medications and whatnot. He has had a couple of run ins with the law over the past year or so, 2 DUIs; one was downgraded to underage drinking because he was 20 at the time and the second will be cleared and left as driving without a license. He had to move back home because he didn't have a vehicle and couldn't afford bills any longer. He works at a restaurant and makes pretty decent money for not paying rent or any other bills (I'm assuming over 2k a month). 

It has gotten to the point where he refuses help, mentoring, counseling and rehab all together. he has never committed to rehab and says it won't help him and that its all a money trap. He says he doesn't feel anything anymore. No motivation, no feelings, no emotions, no love, no anything. I've always been worried about suicide.... My dad walked in on him once while he was sitting on his bed with an unloaded handgun. The gun was at his side with an unloaded magazine and he had a handful of bullets counting them over and over again in a drugged-out stupor: ""One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.... thirteen bullets. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.... thirteen bullets."" And he would keep repeating. My family immediately removed all firearms from our home and that was the first truly alarming thing that happened.

Just today, my parents told him that he was either checking into a rehab clinic today or that he had to leave the house. I suppose they believe that being kicked out and homeless would kick start him into realizing ""Oh shit... what have I done...."" or something like that. But now he refuses. He said he just wanted to wait and go when he was ready, but if he's being forced then there is no way in hell he's going. Then he told them that he's just going to kill himself and put an end to it all. No more addiction for me, no more having a ""worthless, piece of shit child wasting space"" for them. 

I guess I just need advice. He's so cold and shut off from the world now. He won't talk to me or if he does, it's never coherent and always irrational. 

Thank you in advance.",17

Philippians 4:4-9 (KJV)  Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.
Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.

Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.

He was clean from December 2019 to July 2020, relapsed once, and has been completely clean since. Thirteen years of use, starting with IV morphine because he punctured a lung at 17, and exacerbated by doctors throwing percocet down his throat until it eventually devolved into a full-blow street heroin addiction. 

But he’s clean now; he has his license, a car, a good job, and is even thinking about college next year. His grandmother is 87 and doesn’t have much time left and I know she was afraid she’d outlive him or never get to see him recover, but she has. It’s probably the best gift he could have given her because she loves him SO much and only ever wanted to see him healthy again. On top of that he’s learned how to empathize better, how to take responsibility for himself, and how to break out of that “addict mindset” that a lot of people still struggle with even when they’re sober. 

I’m really proud of him :’) But I also wanted to share this to people who might be struggling with hopelessness because of how long they’ve had an addiction for, or because they feel like they’ve “missed out” on a lot because their “best years” went to drugs. There’s no age limit on life and any years can be your best years. Just because you’ve struggled for a long time doesn’t mean you’ve missed your chance at recovery. It’s never too late, and it’s never “not worth it”. My bf never even dared to think that he might be clean again one day. He always assumed he’d succumb to addiction. But he hasn’t! He’s still here, and so are you. I’m proud of every one of you who’s still kicking, and I believe in you. Don’t give up hope!",50

However, recently I started having doubts about all of it. I started wondering whether it was worth it to be doing all of this at such a young age since I really do want to experience a 'normal' life like other kids. I'm sure most kids my age are doing it all the time and aren't having issues with it. I was sort of curious on how I'd react to it after having abstained for such a long time. I thought the abstaining might have changed the way I react to masturbation. I haven't acted on these thoughts but I'd like some advice regarding them.

Also, recently the act of abstaining hasn't been the same as when I started. It's become more of an obligation and I'm just mindlessly avoiding it. I feel just about the same as when I was doing it all where my emotions barely surface. Only difference is I'm not feeling down all the time.

I'd like some advice please thanks!",5

i’m totally new to this subreddit but just need to vent about myself. was originally on r/stims but i think this might be a better place.  i really hope someone can relate to this and maybe even guide me. preface; i’m undiagnosed adhd (will be getting clinical advice within the coming weeks) and addicted to sex. i’m a 29 yr old male, gay, and generally up for a good time. i’ve tried coke on occasion and have had decent experiences with it… minus sometimes having depressing come downs. anyway, i went out with some friends one night and hopped onto grindr when i came home-as one does and was talking up this hot fit tattooed up guy. he comes to my house decked out in LV, gucci, and driving a new audi. and i’m thinking sick, this guy is kind of on my level(i have a higher paying healthcare job myself). after fucking he proceeds to open up his bum bag: grab his stash and do a line. he offers me some which i said yes. this is some good shit, after two bumps i was up all fucking night. he leaves me a rock and goes on his way. i’m avoiding the rock he gave me for about a week when finally i have the worst sleep of my life and have to go into work early that day. i tried coke sober for my first time that day and i just felt like my brain connected for the first time. hard to explain but i could actually foresee what outcomes would happen before making decisions on things. (i hope that makes sense) after i was finished what he gave me i was hooked. bought an 8ball which lasted a little over 2 weeks. i started using before work very frequently and if i went out do drink with friends i would do a bump. yesterday i finished what i picked before work and i made a pact with myself to not pick up again. that lasted one night and he just dropped off another 8ball tonight after i went out for some drinks with friends. my friends actually came back to my house for a night cap and i just couldn’t wait for them to leave and he could come over. i’m embarrassed my super infrequent usage has turned into something i crave and use before work so i’m alert. i’ve only spend 600$ but i’m saving for a house and have other (better) things i could easily have spent that money on. feeling down on myself because i know i have a very addictive personality, and i really don’t want this to be another substance i use and abuse and then have to quit.

if you have read to the end, i really appreciate it. if you have any advice to curb this even better! i am going to be talking to this with a professional in about a week but im afraid i’ll use before work/during work tomorrow. any help is appreciated!

tldr: gay man with infrequent coke usage (rarely with friends, never my own) meets hot drug dealer who gave him his first OWN rock. his addictive personality has turned that into 2 8balls in 3 weeks and doing it before/doing work. looking for advice to go back to super infrequent use/completely stopping.",1

It’s July 26, 2021, I’m 20 years and have had  a porn addiction for at least 5-6 years. I’ve seen everything, watched literally everything to the point where it’s hard to even get excited about anything. 

I’m 20 years old, in the prime of my life, attending college with mass amount of beautiful women. I’m 20 years old, I’m good looking, I’m creative, and god damnit I’m funny. I’m 20 years old and no longer will this filth hold me back.

I want to be able to talk to a lady without having a full blown anxiety attack.
I want to be able flirt like I know I can. I want to have sex like it’s meant to be. I’m sick of letting my brain, my addictions get the better of me. Keeping from what I want to do in life. 

I’m 20 years and this is the end of a life that I didn’t want to live. Not to quote J cole, but this my life now. Not porn’s , not nicotine’s, not anxiety’s, but myn. 
I will have a beautiful blonde 10 at my place by the end of this year. But first I must rid myself of this filth. 

I sat at my desk for an hour an half and wrote 5 rules that I will write down for the next year of my life, everyday, once a day.

1. Every-time I’m uncomfortable I will embrace it 
2. Every-time I have a thought I will challenge it 
3. If I want something I will go get it 
4. Every-time I want to hit nicotine I will tap the back of my pen 🖊 twice
5. Every-time I want to watch porn, I will text a buddy a gif of Donte Mutombo giving the waving finger (or something of that nature)

I’m done living a life I don’t want to live… Some people kill themselves, some live lies, and some just sit there and take it. But the people who challenge the world, challenge themselves, will ultimately always end up on top. 
This is my stand, to save the kid I once knew, as well as to save his save his future. 

My journey starts now… :)",4

I’ve confronted him about the fact that this makes me upset and uncomfortable as I’ve lost friends to cocaine more so than to other drugs, but he insists that this is his way of “coping” and that it’s not a big deal. To me, it sounds more like romanticizing his addiction. Something I can understand is that if I were to be in his shoes for a day, drug use and losing friends so frequently wouldn’t seem like a big deal to me either, because that’s just how life is on drugs and you eventually get used to it.

There is plenty of science to back up that statement and I am not going to waste anyone's time by presenting it here. If you don't believe me however, just do a google or youtube search about sugar addiction. 

I'm not against carbs or a big health nut, but I have noticed I can't control myself eating and drinking sugary sweets.  Without embellishing, 1 entire box of cookies is 1 ""serving size"" to me.  I could say the same about eating a pint of ice cream too, but I'm going to jump that hurdle another time.

So after eating my last cookie this morning (for breakfast), I decided it was time to recognize the addiction and stop.  I look forward to it, I know I will have a hard time with it, but my easiest game plan is to just not buy them anymore.  I plan to cut out other sweets, and drink sugary drinks too, but my primary biggest vice is the cookies.  I want to focus on deleting that from my life first.

The first few days i felt so accomplished like I can do anything, the lack of withdrawal surprised me. Then I started having really vivid smoking dreams that felt insanely real. At about the 3 week mark this depression hit me harder than ever, I feel so numb to enjoyment and overall really sad. Nothing is making me feel better I feel myself getting dragged down deeper and deeper everyday. I don't know how to express how I feel so I hide it I've been venting to someone but she can only do so much over text. I really wish someone would come and hold me and cuddle me thru this I think Then I would feel something real because of the oxytocin rush or whatever it's called. If anyone has ever gone thru this can you tell me when this is gonna end I just want to be myself again or give me some tips to fight thru this.",7

 My addiction began innocently, as a medical patient. Patients start this addiction with a guy in a white coat. At a young age, we are told to trust the medical professional. Granted, much of the issue stems from self-ownership, however that does not address the whole opioid epidemic.  I had 17 surgeries in my life and I developed a high tolerance for pain meds. So I often would take higher doses or run out of meds much quicker than I was supposed to. The Biggest issue is I really liked the way they made me feel.  I didn't know that this was leading me down the path of almost 2 decades of opioid abuse. I stand firm in my belief that addicts are extremely intelligent, creative human beings. Seriously, have you ever seen an unemployed, homeless addict who has nothing, yet can support a $300-a-day drug habit? Just let that sink in… most people struggle to just stay afloat. But there is no stopping an addict when it comes to finding their next fix. What if an addict channels that fire or that “thing” and learns to use it for good?",9

WARNING: Large wall of text incoming!

**Written Saturday, July 24 2021, at 5:55 AM.  Finished the same day at 8:00 AM.**      


The past few days have made me feel like I need to re-evaluate the direction my life is going in once more.  I've had lots of sex, played lots of games, and basically had the life most guys dream of.  But here I am, still unsatisfied.  Still stuck with *dukkha.*    

**And yet, I feel like I have finally found the solution – what is good, vs what is right.**    

Bear with me as I explain what led me to this point, please.  Most of it will sound immature, but I promise it ends on an uplifting note.  Chances are that if you're reading this, that twisted combination of nihilism and optimism is exactly what you need right now.  :)    

I hooked up with another guy last night.  It was super hot, and basically exactly what I was looking for: we cuddled with a superhero show, made out, and after the clothes slowly came off, we had intense, passionate sex for about an hour and a half.  We did anything and everything I wanted to do – it was as close to perfect as a date can get.  Made me feel like a secure, attractive man whose needs were being met.    

And yet...he ended up leaving, obviously not wanting to come back.  Didn't want my number, gave me a vague promise about chatting again on the app.  And here I am this morning, back to square one, wondering what the hell is wrong with me.  

He was the fourth guy I've had in a week.  

What I'm really trying to say, is... **I don't like the kind of person I become when I'm on these apps.**   

It's like...OK, I get it.  I act like a playboy on these apps, and so I attract playboys.  But why is it that all the people who want relationships are so fucked up these days?  The playboys are the only ones that are halfway normal psychologically – I know, because I've had plenty of experience with both ends of the spectrum.  I still go back to that narcissistic married guy I chatted with last week.  I tell him I just want to be friends, and he freaks out and basically says I'm a slut.  That guy is the type I usually think of when I imagine a gay guy who wants a relationship.  I tried catering to those guys in my early 20s, and that failed miserably.  Most of them just wanted sex anyway.  It's been that way ever since I came out 13 years ago.   

No wonder most monastic paths require chastity.    

Not only that, but I woke up this morning and did some Starcraft and Hearthstone, and I was unusually bothered by the fact that everybody I played with this morning was better than me.  Again, it's like...okay, I get it.  It's early Saturday morning, and all the sweaties are out in full force, because it's the weekend.  I get that I'm not the best at much of any game, because I play as a jack of all trades, master of none.  But it still bothered me more than it should have, just because a few guys (or women perhaps) were better than me at a stupid little game. 

And they probably aren't getting blowjobs from four people in less than a week.    

**That's the story of my life right now: it's bothering me more than it should.**  I get that I'm just another horny, nerdy, underachieving guy, in a world that certainly has no shortage of them.  I'm can't pretend that I'm God's gift to humanity anymore.  Quite the opposite, in fact: men like me are kind of the problem with this world, according to most normies, politicians and pundits.  And yet here I am, choosing to be that way, because I feel like the costs of living life the way **they** want me to outweigh the benefits.  But even that doesn't really matter, because my family, friends, and lovers all accept me as I am.  The only one expecting me to do more with my life...is me.    

But why does that bother me so damn much?  Why do I feel like I **have** to go out of my way to please a world that doesn't give a shit about me?  Why do I feel this compulsive need to be the best at everything I do?  I've always been a bit of a perfectionist, of course, but I feel like I should know better by now.  After all the knowledge I've gained about the unity of consciousness, the manipulation of humanity, the illusion of reality...why am I still clinging to something as trivial as a fucking videogame or hookup app?  Why do I care if I'm not married or working some stale 9-5 job?  Anybody can do that.  So why do I feel like a monster just because I'm **not** doing that?

I've already tried volunteering, getting an entry level job, going to school, mental health treatment, support groups...basically all of the cookie cutter solutions that normies recommend for improving my life, short of relocating to another country and starting over.  And even if I did that, I'd probably face the same problems.  I feel like I've gotten to a point where I can't keep trying to solve this problem intellectually.  Once again: I can't look **outside** for solutions to my problems anymore, much less the world's problems.  I've tried that for most of my life, and it's obviously failed.  I have to look **inside.**   

So, I feel like I should start with what I can change **right now.**  I feel like if I can solve my boredom and loneliness, I can solve all of my other problems.  And the only real answer that comes to mind is that I just kinda have to sit with it.  **Trying to put a band aid over the wound with videogames and gay hookups doesn't seem to be working.**  Which is strange, because in some ways, I'm better at those two things than I've ever been, despite the fact that my body is in worse shape than it's ever been.    

**The good news is that even if I'm alone, I still have guidance.**  A phrase popped into my head this morning, that I swear came from a Higher Power of some kind: *my problem is that I've been doing what feels* ***good****, instead of doing what feels* ***right****.*  Just because something feels right, doesn't mean it's going to automatically be fun and awesome.  Sometimes, the absolute best thing to do is the thing that makes us feel like shit.  And it doesn't have to be what everybody else or doing, or even what we don't want to do.  **Sometimes, the right thing to do is something that our heart and soul have been begging us to do for a while, but that our minds and bodies have every reason not to do.**    

And right now, I have no doubt what that right thing to do is: I have to disconnect.       
Intellectually, I have no reason to quit hookup apps and videogames right now.  My life is pretty stable, I have tons of games to play, I'm well respected in the community.  I have easy sex, easy entertainment, and easy fixes.  Going off the grid in the past has meant potentially losing all of that.  

I don't want to end up being carted off to the nuthouse for the dozenth time, because I ran outside naked with my fat ass hanging out for the whole world to see, as the cops cuff me and carry me away, just because I was off my pills, struggling with the voices/visions and lost myself in a fantasy world again.  (It's happened before, unfortunately...) That is obviously the worst possible solution.  It's quite literally looking outside for answers when I shouldn't be...hahaha.  Good to see I can laugh about it – perhaps there's hope yet.  :)    

But maybe my problem before was that I was disconnecting in the wrong way.  *I felt like I had to change something on the* ***outside****, when really I had to change what was* ***inside.***  In other words, maybe I have to be okay with just laying in bed and chilling, only getting up to eat (I technically don't need my phone to go to a restaurant or catch the bus), go to the bathroom, and maybe go for a walk.  I don't need to become a lunatic prophet or a conspiracy blogger to live without videogames and hookups.  Once I get past the first few weeks of screen withdrawal, then I can start figuring out what I want to do with my life.  Maybe once my dopamine levels stabilize, then I can pick up painting or drawing or poetry again.     

Yes, it will be lonely.  Yes, I will probably run into resistance.  Yes, I will probably miss out on a lot of hot sex, interesting media, and evolving knowledge if I do decide to cut out what I'm doing now.  But my heart is telling me that if I want to recover from my addictions to sex, games and food, I have to disconnect, and I have to do it now.    

I don't think that means I have to give up on people and technology entirely, though.  It just means that I have to stop relying on them to make my life work.  In the case of my phone, for example, I think it's better if I just keep it on silent, and otherwise use it like I normally would.  (I have family on emergency override - iPhone is good for that.)  And I can always fire up the computer, the Switch, or the Roku when someone comes over and wants something to do.     

But on the other hand, when it's just me going about my day, and I have nobody else around...I don't have to do a damn thing if I don't want to – not even meditating.  If I just want to lay in bed, talk to myself, and pay attention to whatever feels right, I can most certainly do that.  Who's going to notice or care at this point?  I know I'm sounding cynical and cold here.  But if I keep living my life for the rest of the world, it's going to end up killing me.  I am quite certain of that.  And that is why I need to stop.  I will have doubts at first – that's normal, I think.  But the few times I've tried it, I remember being happy after a very short period of time.  The challenge will be to avoid being sucked back in.  But I believe in myself.  I just need to remember why I did it in the first place.     

I can do this.  I am a good person.  I just need to remember that.  I can't let this world convince me that I'm doing life wrong.  The very concept sounds so ridiculous now that I write it out.  And yet, that is precisely what I have been concerned about...what so many humans are obsessed about.  I have to let it go.  Like one crazy guy I read once pointed out: I am not Stardog.  I am Infinite Consciousness, having an experience called Stardog – the same as an experience called Starcraft, or Scruff, or Netflix and chill, or whatever.  What I call that Infinite Consciousness – which is the same as everybody else's – doesn't really matter at all.  God, Creator, Source...different names, same essence.     

And right now, I have to go with the experience that **feels right** – not the experience that feels good.  I tried sticking to good experiences for most of my life, and all I got was endless craving for more and more and more – the epitome of dukkha.  There's no better time than the present to try going for the **right experience** instead.  And the right experience, I think, is to just let go, lay down, and enjoy the simple things in life: family, friends, and faith.     

I'm Stardog, and I hope this post helps you.  Thanks for reading. <3",5

As a recovering coke addict, stress is a terrible trigger, and I have been trying to avoid it at all costs, and rest when I get tired, instead of giving up. 

This morning I woke up at 7am and I got to see the sun coming out of the ocean, out of my hotel window. That big red ball, and the sky was pink and orange. 

I spent the entire day at the beach, walking up and down the shore with my son. We got to see a family of huge jubarte whales swimming nearby. The sea was calm and the sky was clear, a cold breeze blowing all day, but the sun was warm and cozy. 

I am in a city in the south of Brazil right now, and we have a mild winter here, compared to northern hemisphere. 

Later in the day, my son went to hangout with his friends and I walked back to the hotel, just as the moon was coming out of the ocean, silver and shiny, at the same spot the sun showed up before. 

A full cycle. Some flocks of birds in V shape flew over. Someone on a delta wing took a smooth dive from the hills and landed on the sand… So much to see and appreciate just in one day. 

22 weeks clean. Alive. Better than ever. 

My day was pure poetry and I wanted to share. Look for the sun, the moon and the stars. It’s in nature I find my energy to keep alive. 

Have a great weekend, group.",10

Getting sober is way easier in comparison to staying sober. I struggle, but I'm still on the straight and narrow.

Ultimately, however, it wouldn't be ""just a day"". Knowing myself and how my brain works, it would just be the start of another months long relapse.

He now works as a counselor there and he is studying to be a preacher at first we were both supportive and loving towards each other but he never really wanted to talk about our recovery instead he would say he had more of a sin problem than a addiction. We have been together for 8 months and about a month ago he saw my lock box that I used at the beginning of my recovery because I was taking suboxene. Around this same time his recovery brother and mentor relapsed confessing to him that the doctor perscribed him adderall and after taking it he was triggered to begin using agian after maybe a year, and he also got promoted to being the director of the program because of his mentor's relapse. I work more in the clinical side as a Peer Support and have been in recovery for nearly three years without relapsing. I also believe in the studies done on this medication and believe that as long as it is taken within a strict treatment plan that he has the potential to heal the damage in the mind while it also has a platuea effect which means you can't just keep taking more and get high off of it while it is a blocker. But being in a church community recovery I have found that there is such a stigmatizim around medication such as this that I do not share how I feel or that I have used it. Even though there are some that can make it without it and some that can't and also some that try to abuse it I also feel that every person's recovery just as they're faith is based on they're own personal journey. I respect wach of those different journey's even to the ones that have relapsed multiple times because that's just apart of they're journey in other words just because it's different from mine doesn't mean that it's wrong or that mine is right.

After seeing this lock box which I saw him see and saw his reaction he has acted like a completely different person towards me treating me pretty much like a junkie investigating everything that i am doing, saying, and spending. He has gotten distant and so self centered around everything that happens towards me and my son that it finally got to the point that I called him out on it. Like he had me pay for our hotel when we took a trip to the beach saying that he would give me half and then practically stopped talking to me and kept giving me excuses and then last night he goes into a rant about how he needs space to process how upset he is with me for not telling him about me taking this medication. He said that he had asked me what medication I was on and he felt that i beat around the bush about it and now he feels that he can not trust me because of it and he had given me time and grace to tell him the truth but I chose not too. To be clear he texted me what medication had I decided to stop taking recently and I am not going to put that in text, but when he came at me last night with such judgement I did text it now I feel that he is going to go around to everyone that I work with in the church community broadcasting this information. I just don't know how I feel about all of this did he have a right to know what kind of medication I was taking? Was I not being honest by chosing not to tell him? I am convicted about all of this and I want to grow and be a better person

This was the actual conversation:

*Me:* 

*I've been worried about you after Kash, the new responsibilities, your mom, the fire, and th*e *distance along with not having time to process yourself and also feeling a very heavy internal struggle within myself. I don't know how to process that in a way that we both feel we can express what we need, in a form that we both feel safe and connected. Unlearning the way that the painful world has taught me to connect and process is more challenging for me during times of distress when I naturally want to disconnect. Which I know can trap someone in monologue like being stuck in self and my own head internalizing everything. Connection while being open is the only way to come out of that. This fear comes over me that I don't want you to be in pain and it's difficult for me to process that I can't do anything about it. I'm learning that you body tells your emotions even when you don't want to acknowledge them. In these situations my heart is racing, I feel heavy, tired, my feelings are hollow and breathless. Which is telling me I feel insecure, confused, lonely and depressed I don't know if your having the same feelings? It's difficult for me to simply be present and to actually feel the painful situation without trying to fix it. But I know for me I just want you to be present and don't need you to fix it and I know the Lords grace has given you the ability to handle all of this to solve what needs to be solved I never want you to think that me trying to push you means that I don't think you are capable I do I just hate that you have to be. Being a person who feels so incredibly deeply what others are feeling or as if I were in that position especially with those that I care deeply for at times becomes overwhelming and I can't stand to feel it so I go into trying to fix it or dissociate from it but I am trying to fight against that instinct and be more Christ like by trying to jump into the messiness of life and feel the painful stuff with you without detaching, fixing, or internalizing.* 

*Him:*  
*I'm creating space not bc I can't handle all of what's is going in but bc what's actually going on with you and I has me so upset that it will get in the  way of me being able to handle all of what I have going on. So I create space to allow myself to do what has to be done while trying to allow the Lord to help me process things. But I guess here we are and it is what it is. I asked you a few times about your medications and I felt you beat around the bush, I did that bc I wanted to give  you the opportunity to tell me but you chose not to. I have boundaries in my recovery that are non negotiable and the meds your on and were on and kept that from me is unacceptable and has now broken my trust. Simple aa that.  Now that you have the info you want, I am fine, I will be fine and I need space so I can handle all I have happening and I'm sorry if that upsets you but that's what it is*",3

7 days free

I still get irrationally angry, and have cravings. When I crave it, I just remind myself that it only feels good for about 10 seconds, then I’ll be back to wishing I could quit and I start this whole cycle over again.

This is the longest break I’ve had since New Years res of 2020.

2021-07-23 14:27:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/oq8ejo/cant_seem_to_fully_get_free/,Can't seem to fully get free.,"A little backstory:

I suck at sleeping. Insomnia has been a part of my life for a decade or so. I found Kratom 7 years ago while searching for ""natural sleep aids"" online. I ordered some and it worked great. Sleep was back! 

So for 7 years I was a daily Kratom user and by the end it had mostly killed any form of human feelings I used to have. Life was grey at best so I set out on a long, successful taper. January of this year I was completely off Kratom with no withdrawals due to the 6 month taper, and I had my life back for the most part. It was nice to feel some motivation towards life again. 

About a month or so after that, I decided to use Kratom again (bad idea, I know) just not everyday in order to avoid physical addiction while at least getting some sleep. It worked great, or so it seemed. I would take Kratom on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. 

After a few weeks of that I started taking Phenibut on Mondays and Fridays in order to help with sleep on the days I wasn't taking Kratom. That also worked great. No physical dependency, and a great nights sleep. 

Then I started drinking on Wednesday and Sunday to help with sleep on the days w/o Kratom or Phenibut. I am sure everyone sees where this is going.

It has been 7 months since I stopped taking Kratom everyday, and 7 months since I have been physically dependent on any substance. That said, I am now mentally addicted to three substances and back in the ritual/routine or planning when to take each substance on its designated day. 

To ensure I wasn't just telling myself I wasn't addicted, last week I went the whole week without taking anything at all. I didn't have any physical withdrawals from anything, but my insomnia sure took a toll on me and it was a pretty crappy week due to averaging 3 hours of sleep a day, and boy was I bored! So I went back on my substance schedule. Apparently a good chunk of my daily excitement/enjoyment is looking forward to when I can take that day's substance. 

On the bright-side, I still have a zest for life, I am not struggling at work, I am not moping around all day or being angry at my family for no real reason, which I am thankful for, however I can't help but feel life could be even better if I just didn't consume any substance. Does anyone have any tips on how to let go of a substance and not replace it with anything new? Hope everyone reading this is doing ok!",8

However emotionally why? The answer is it can always get you slightly closer to the next high. You've been smoking weed you know what'll get you closer to the next high more weed or 2 hits from a cig or vape. Your at work and need a buzz can't drink, can smoke weed, caffeine doesn't make you feel shit. Well..  here's some good ole addictive nic. You've been drinking but don't wanna drink anymore because you know you'll feel sick well good ole nic is here for ya. Damn i just had some good tail/sasuage you know what'll make it better... THAT'S RIGHT good ole nic. Most drugs have a while to hit you but nic can hit you instantly which is why its addictive. That why nic patches help the nic hits you slowly. Vapes hit people who are highly addicted at a slower pace. So what do you do to stop nic? Stop buy it? If you want some ask a co worker this may spread out the days and time. Once they say no im tired of you muching you should be at the point where you can handle a while without nic. And it'll fade. (23- 5 cigs a day since 15 vapes since 19). Try to fade from vaping.",2

To give a little background I’ve used hard drugs for about six years (MDMA, Cocaine, Crack cocaine) plus everything other than heroin but not frequently.

At the height of my addiction I would go through 10.5G of raw a week and I was high everyday which was about a year ago, and I’ve tapered down to where I’d use maybe 1 or 2 grams in a week. Whenever I’m using cocaine I like to drink with it.

The financial side has never been an issue however it’s severely impacting my physical and mental health. I have a good life, with a lot to lose. I feel like I want sobriety more than I have in the past. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

My best friend started to regurly do drugs about 8 months ago. It started with weed and psychedelics. At some point she got addicted to weed and was aware of it. Than she started doing harder drugs like amphetamine and cocaine. She told me recently that she's no longer addicted to weed and rarely smokes. But it looks like she shifted from weed to amphetamine (She was high every time we saw each recently, last time I saw her she needed to get high in order to leave the house). She claims that she doesnt have a problem, and gets really defensive whenever I ask her about it. I think she realises that she's addicted, but doesnt want to stop using or to get help. Ive tried talking to her about it and it doesnt work. Also, she told me that her current girlfriend uses heroine.

 Because of all of that whenever I see her I get anxious as fuck and it lasts for several days. I can't focus on other stuff and constantly think about her and what will happen when amphetamine won't be enough (as is weed now). I've talked to my other friend (who also struggles with addiction) about it, and she suggest I cut her off. It feels like a good thing to do for my own sake, but on the other hand She's my best friend. I have no idea of what i should do and im just more and more worried and stressed every day.

So I'm 22 and I'm unemployed, well actually I've just started a well paid job working from home, I live with my parents I've been spoilt all my life, the give me everything never changed me rent and I'd spend all of my student loan magic cards, video games any old dumb shit, I've been on universal credit the past year, covid made it even harder to get a job since I've never worked, I got £350 a month and I did well saving most if it until I started playing magic the gathering again, I stopped actually buying cards a year or so ago cos I didn't play as much, but during lockdown I got super into it again, building decks even tho I couldn't go out and play, I got in touch with my old group and we played online and now we go out every week to play and tbh its a good thing its my only time I get out and socialise for that matter.

But God I have no money, its not even like I'm buying cards over £20 I have a limit but I'll spend £60 on singles I need or buying packs, which is actually just gambling no hiding that, it's not just magic tho or I'd put I'm addicted to magic, I just buy shit I bought a fucking gun skin in cod the other day just because I could, I got paid on the 9th this month and got £340 I now have £40 left £300 in just a few weeks. I'm sure there's far worse things to spend more money on but I have a problem, at least I have a decent playing job now, I'm gonna save cos I wanna get a house with my gf, gonna put money away. Magic is just a dumb game and prices fluctuate constantly so I snatch up good deals before the cards shoot up. 

Magic madhouse doesn't help as they have a pay later option so I spend my money on cards till I have hardly any left then spend another £60 that I only have to pay after a month, rinse repeat. Also getting depressed being at home so I spend, hopefully this job will help I'm determined to do well.",3

Ideally I’d like to kick the nicotine and cocaine forever, and ideally find a way to drink only in social settings (but if that proves impossible, I’d rather give it up forever than slip back to where I am now).

All three have and are continuing to get in the way of my personal relationships, my health (both mental and physical), my sleep schedule, my job, my spirituality, and my happiness. 

Cigarettes, as much as I’d like to quit, are the lowest priority for me because I can’t imagine quitting the other two without them, and they affect my life the least overall (even though they definitely fuck a few things up). 

Coke is the thing I want to give up the most. I feel trapped. I’ve spent thousands in the past year, I get nose bleeds every day, I get nauseous from doing too many lines and then drink to ‘fix’ the nausea and then do another line immediately after I recover even though I know I’ll just get sick all over again. 

I would rather not go to rehab, as I have issues with being institutionalized (mental health stuff in the past), no insurance, and a new job that I love and don’t want to lose. If that’s the only way I would surrender to it, but I’d very much prefer outpatient stuff or advice for quitting by yourself… I also have a partner who also struggles with a coke addiction, and while he also wants to get better, we both end up just feeding into each other’s problems every day… and the combination of the three substances I struggle with feel impossible to conquer because I can’t do coke without drinking, and when I drink I want to smoke more. When I get too drunk I want to smoke a pack in a night, and do a line to “balance myself out”. 

Any advice, PM or reply, is appreciated. I hope everyone else here who is struggling finds the road to recovery like I hope to. Love and light to all of you.",12

Well addiction doesn’t care what you want and one is too many is true and I didn’t respect that and I was wrong.

My mind shifted immediately back into my addiction. Hoping tomorrow will be my new day 1.

I cannot use not even one time not even when things are good even if I don’t want to get high.

But relapse is important part of recovery. You come back stronger and more knowledgeable and because I thought I could use medicinally it would have happened 100% down the line if it didn’t happen now. So it’s a positive and I’m glad I didn’t keep it a secret from my support network.",6

I want to try to intervene but I don't know how efficous it would be. He is currently on probation for trafficking after shipping dab carts to his house and the package being seized. He was supposed to have been getting drug tested during his probation but hasn't once ""because of covid"". His parents have done from what ive seen very little to intervene or punish him. I remember they found a backpack in his basement sophomore year of highschool with a hand gun and a QP of marijuana and didn't do anything to punish him, always seemed very enabling. I don't know how to stage an intervention when his family is so low invested, and most of our friends are enablers, even I have enabled him not saying anything about the Percocet's and cocaine he has been abusing leading up to this. I don't know if rehab is an option for him for me to recommend because he would of course have to report that to his probation officer and have to disclose why he is going. Effectively admitting violation of his probation. I am posting this hoping someone has been in a similar position or has some advice. My friend has a lot going for him: having almost completed an accounting degree. I am very afraid of losing him however. Living in northern Kentucky I have already lost too many close to me to H. I feel optionless in this situation but I really want to do what I can to save my friends life.",11

They had a live-chat thing pop up while I was researching, and I cynically figured it wasn’t a real person, but that it couldn’t hurt to respond and see what would happen. 

After some back-and-forth, she convinced me *almost* unequivocally that she wasn’t a bot, and when I told her as much, she offered to talk to me on the phone, to make me more comfortable. I agreed. 

She totally wasn’t a bot. We talked for **thirty minutes**. We poured our hearts out to each other. I thought. 

I gave her my insurance info, she pulled it up, said there were several options around me, and told me she’d research them and call me back later that day, with a list of options. 

Nothing. For a week now.

I only started the damn chat because I am at the absolute end of my rope. I would never, ever do that normally. But I was desperate, and she seemed so incredibly sweet. 

Maybe it was a mistake or miscommunication, but I worry that my naïveté has bitten me for the first truly significant time in my adult life. I’m so incredibly discouraged and frustrated.

Marijuana hourly. Cocaine weekly. MDMA 2-3 times a month. Tripped LSD and shrooms at least 30 times each. Had a Xanax addiction which nearly landed me in the hospital. Whippet sessions where I’d go through a pack of 50.

I suffered a bit of a mental break in early 2016. I was diagnosed as bipolar (it runs in my family, but was exacerbated by the drug use). Spent a week in a psych ward. Thought that would make me learn my lesson? Wrong. 

After a few months went back to smoking daily, doing some MDMA and cocaine. Thought I was invincible. Then another manic episode, full break from reality. Another week in the psych ward. 

That’s when I decided to stop all the “hard” drugs (everything but weed and alcohol). In august, It’ll be 5 years since any of that. It’s tempting when I’m out partying with friends or going to concerts. Can’t tell you how many lines of coke I’ve turned down. I just know that my brain can’t handle it, and if I get a taste of it I’ll be hooked again. I’m glad that I’m able to stay away from that.

I go through a juul pod every day. Need to cut back on that. I also still have a bit of a drinking problem, which I’m working on. I at least stopped smoking weed 6 months ago.

I messaged the mods about whether or not I could post about just addiction, but after scrolling through the page I'm pretty sure I can. I'm new to Reddit so idk if this is a no-no. If it is, tell me and I'll delete.

Anyway I'm (15f) pretty sure I'm a teenage alcohol abuser. You might have seen on another post in a different subreddit I posted about how I thought it would be cool to try drinking, and it ended up very not cool. The only reason I think this is because I've heard of it, and I did a quick Google search. I think it's enough issues to call myself an addict, but I refuse to tell anyone but internet strangers, therefore I can't get a diagnosis.

The only problem is, I don't know anything about addicts. My parents don't like alcohol so they're definitely not addicts, and last time my mom knew an addict (her father) she locked him out of her life for being ""selfish"". Is my drinking selfish? I don't have any info on addiction except for what they show on Grey's Anatomy, and sometimes when they bring it up in school. Are there rules I have to follow now that liquor rules my life? Things I should be aware of? Please tell me any info, and it's okay to talk to me like I'm five. Talk to me like I know nothing about alcoholism. Also, is it okay for me to post questions I have on here?

**Edit: After talking to some people and a little more learning, I don't think my drinking is terribly affecting me. As long as it's not hurting anyone else, I don't think there's any reason I need to make drastic changes. I'm keeping the post up just in case anyone else has things I can learn from.

2021-07-21 08:12:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ooome0/do_i_have_a_drug_addiction/,Do I have a drug addiction?,"
Hi everyone. I’ve hit the lowest point of my life and I’d appreciate some help. I don’t want to see anyone professional because it would risk me being exposed to my family / friends. 

I started drinking when I was 16. Always the most drunk of my friends. Never knew when to call it a day. Always made a wreck of myself. I never even considered doing drugs until I was 18. 

When I was 18 I tried MDMA for the first time. It was the best experience of my life to date that first time. In the following year I did MDMA on probably 20 occasions. I only did it when going to a party or club. I gradually did more and more on a night out to the point where I was having a gram each time. During that year I developed a massive reliance on it to be chatty and to have fun on a night out. It got to the point where my friends and I would have it after having a few beers at the pub. We loved it. We all jokingly urged each other on. It was all a bit of a laugh. 

The next year, it got much much worse. I would say I did it probably 30 times. The amount per night was out of hand. During this year is when I genuinely could not go out without it. I also began to be extremely depressed for length periods of time. The comedown was getting worse and worse. I would be halfway through a night out and be dreading the next day, even when high on MD. This is when I became self destructive. I was spending so much money on drugs,it was affecting my study, I wouldn’t go to the gym etc. and yet still I convinced myself because others did it that it was okay. It was still a laugh we were just having a good time right? Right…

The next year is where it all came crashing down. 2020. This is when our group was all introduced to, and became frequent users of cocaine. Cocaine was a lot different to mdma in the sense I could act normal on a night out and it was a much better feeling the next day. My sleep really suffered however. Not to mention my bank balance. Anyway, cocaine became what MDMA was for me in the previous two years. I did it routinely. This has carried over into 2021. 

I am known by many in the area and those I’m close to as a party boy, someone who goes hard on a night out (as cringe as that sounds). I keep telling myself I’ll stop. Never again. This is the last time. It’s the same routine every Sunday as a I wake up feeling depressed. Do I have an addiction? I genuinely think my will power will stop this cycle one day. I don’t ever crave it during the week. I can go weeks without it (e.g. in lockdown). I still study and I’m still motivated. However I’m extremely depressed sometimes to the point of contemplating suicide. It’s a real mess. Sometimes I think I’ve lost my old self. The guy who existed pre-drinking and pre-drugs. I have a really strong family and friends network FYI. 

Thanks",7

I knew I’d end up still awake in 8 hours, heart racing and body shaking and trying desperately through drink and smoke and pills to sleep. And that the following day I’d feel awful and most likely cancel my appointments and finish the sham spiral right where i started. 

So without really missing a beat, I turned around and came back. Having a cigarette and taking that in and trying to congratulate myself. Of course I miss the bittersweet chaos of giving my self control to a drug, I know that this will ultimately be more comfortable and hopefully build towards something I can be proud of.",82

I really want off the things and want her to come with but I feel like she doesn't share those feelings. I known you can't help someone who doesn't want it but recently we tried heroin ( we couldn't find any perks and figured it's an opiaye just do small amounts) and now it's "" no big deal""... it scares tf outta me because before we got our own place my gf was the kinda person that would flip shit if heroin was around because her brother has od'ed multiple times and now it's no big deal to go get a pack and make it last 6- 8 hours. (Btw We don't inject it, we snort it.) I've tried to talk to her about stopping and how we have to be on the same page and both want it or neither of us will get clean. I guess I'm asking for any kinda advice or insight to what I'm about to be walking into. I've gone thru some withdrawals before, I tbh don't know how intense they were but it Made Me stay awake and I had the worst restless legs and arms ever lol, I didn't throw up or anything but the hot n cold flashes were intense af. I really would like to have my gf get clean with me but idk how to help make that have a higher success rate or w.e...all I know is I have to get clean or im going to end up going to prison or dying. Possibly dying in prison. So any kind of help, advice  or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for listening to my rant!",4

She does not have ADHD, but has severe depression and was prescribed Adderall. 

She has not been talking to me much all of a sudden but yesterday we finally had a chance to speak. She says that she ""had never been truly happy"" before starting the Adderall, that she wishes she had been prescribed it sooner because ""I could have done so much more in school, I could have gotten straight As and a PhD,"" that she has massive emotional breakdowns now in the middle of the day because she's built up a tolerance to it and it no longer lasts all day. She's stopped seeing or talking to most of her friends because of this. I could go on. But it sounds like addiction. With that said, I think she does take the drug exactly as prescribed.

She believes that the medicine is just treating her depression and the way she's feeling is just because she's no longer depressed. She said ""so this is how everyone else feels all the time"". I have tried to gently push her towards the idea that it may just be the medication causing a high. But because it's her prescribed medication she can't/won't think of it in any frame other than ""this medication is curing my depression"".

What should I do? I'm very worried for her and I'm not sure she realizes addiction is a possibility. Also, am I worried over nothing since it is prescribed?",2

My gf got a little upset with me, for always saying I wanna quit but never really trying that hard. Something about the way she said it resonated with me. She came over Friday to help keep me accountable. The entire weekend, I’m thinking “as soon as she leaves Monday morning I’m buying a vape”.

She leaves, and I think “maybe just wait til after work, I haven’t gone a whole workday without it in as long as I can remember.”

I leave work, and I think “just wait until at least 8, I’m so close to a full 72 hours it would be a shame to give up now.”

8 o’clock rolls around and that’s it. I can’t do it, I can’t go back. I can’t put myself through that again. 

Things that helped:
 - having an accountability partner 
 - we made muffins, and had salty snacks around all weekend.
 - hydrate
 - exercise

This is the first time I’ve made it a full, strict 72 hours without nicotine or marijuana since before the pandemic.

If I feel like it, I will post an update after 7 days and another after 30, one more after a year. Can’t think too far ahead though.",36

He was telling me he needed $3000 to pay his psychiatrist so I’m going to pay him $1000 to complete my conversion van. The big issue is.. I took acid and I smoked tons of weed when I was about 16-17. I developed paranoia.. Disorganized thinking. And the absolute only way I can go uphill is by quitting cigarettes, and no drugs whatsoever. I went to a mental hospital for marijuana toxicity after smoking everyday (gram of dab everyday for a year) a year and a half ago, they put me on risperidone (an anti psychotic) which gave me heavy HEAVY side effects. I stopped taking them over 6 months ago.

I kept making excuses for why I wasn't an addict. But finally I put it all together. That all of my actions added up to be the exact behavior of an addict.

Reality really sets in when you realize how life has changed. Everything I was passionate about before is no longer important to me. Drugs are almost all I even think about anymore. Drugs are my life now...

or a whole of yourself but empty?
if there’s anything this years’ taught me,
it’s that the only thing I’m sure of is my own uncertainty

in the midst of these contradictions lies undormant, unspoken addictions
because it’s easy to tell myself it’s not my fault when it’s a family tradition
when the days begin to fold into one another like pages of a wet bible

I ask myself, “maybe if I’d been forced to read one this’d be an unimaginable issue”

A year has proved to be enough to turn “new me,” into a reality
A year ago I was the kid, a kid,
who’d feel better than anyone I deemed unjustified, unaged ‘addicts’ 
funny how high horses are capable of becoming donkeys, proven to myself by me
so, sorry for not calling you back, I was trying to get clean
then I realized it’s easier to talk when I’m dirty

I’ll meet you out front and send the money
just don’t pull up in front of the cameras or my parents might see
And in that moment I’m reminded of the luck and privilege bestowed on me
“just don’t pull up in front of the cameras or my parents
might see”

it’s not that I don’t feel guilty, remorseful, embarrassed
I just can’t seem to see how some of you survived this drug free
By choice or necessity, I do commend thee
But may I remind you that lifestyle is simply not enough to justify any kind of insubstantial superiority

because I wonder, if we judged our own like we judged ourselves, 
with the same understanding that nurture is in fact the foundation of our convictions
would we offer each other the same benefit of the doubt we permit ourselves?
would our society be more understanding of and proceed to do something about addictions?
would we try harder to look out for and help and reach each other?

I’m not sure the answer and will never be, but I find solace in knowing that neither will anyone else
there’s something soothing about living amongst addicted, self righteous, accepting, judging people, when you know that in spite of and because of our experiences, we will never be able to perceive each other correspondingly",3

I thought it stopped two years ago with my gambling addiction cause csgo gambling got somehow stopped. But the youtubers I used to watch for csgo gambling started with online casino, and so did I. But in the last 3 months it getting more and more out of hand. Im throwing my money out of the window every month after 2 weeks gaining it from my workplace. This needs to stop asap! But I cant talk to my family about this neither friends cause im ashamed for it. I am living in Germany and really dont know if a gambling addiction is seen as an illness here. But I need help but probably cant handle it by myself. So im trying to get some attention from you guys. Maybe you have had the same problem or still have it too. Im realizing every money is going into the casino thing and I didnt really bought something for myself in the past 6 months. I also dont have money to spend time with some friends or go on events like open airs. 
Hopefully some of you can give me tips to get over it.",3

I come from a family of addiction with each member having been hooked on something different. I grew up very aware of this because for my father it was alcohol and you do the math there.

I have an important internship approaching that drug tests so I went cold turkey and was able to find myself 40 days clean. Though, all I did was replace my love of highs for a love of getting drunk. 40 days in a row I’ve drank. Never at an obscure time of day always after work but it is undoubtedly becoming a problem.

I  really need to share this and I could just a virtual hug from someone.

I'm  an addict and I have been using opiates and kratom to cope with  childhood trauma and how I feel about myself. I grew up in a middle  class family and I was a smart, very sensitive kid. I was in the gifted program which is  a program for highly intelligent kids. I think you need to have an IQ  of over 130 to get in. I was a happy kid until about middle school where  I was bullied relentlessly to the point of me wishing to commit  suicide. By the end of my childhood I had no self-esteem and no  self-love. However, that wasn't what started my using of heroin and  other opiates. What really did it was that I always wanted to be a  musician since I was a teenager. However, I was told that I had no  talent despite just being a beginner. I quit because I felt so terrible  about myself. I quit a serious passion in my life because I felt so  worthless and my addiction started very quickly after that. I felt my life had no meaning to it and that there was something fundamentally wrong with me.

I  felt like my bottom has been an emotional and spiritual one. I still  have a job and my relationships, but at the end of my using of opiates  and heroin I wanted to kill myself. I'm at about 37 days clean from  opiates. I just could use some encouragement that my life can get better  from here and that recovery is actually worth it. I'm on step 2 with my  sponsor. I don't know if I can live this way anymore. I just feel dead  inside even if my life hasn't been ruined on the outside.",7

It was always embarrassing but that was like all I wanted to do. It wasn't healthy and I would look at it for hours on end. So fast forward to when Facebook came out. I was a weirdo and would browse Facebook looking for pictures of girls I knew. It was weird and then when I would do coke I always wanted to talk to them or.message them. It was fucking weird.man. like I wouldn't do that shit ever when I wasn't doing coke. So I drank alot because I was so shameful of my actions and embarrassed. I don't want to toot my own horn but I am genuinely nice person. So it became a problem. I went to rehab and stayed sober for a little over a year and then started doing coke regularly. It's been tough as shut because I went from being super into taking care of my body and eating right and worried about school to not giving a shit about anything. It's quite frightening how much work I've missed. I don't know how much longer I will.be employed if I continue this and don't get help. I don't want to get more coke but it just pops up.in my head and I convince myself it's a good idea. I just want to stop I want to stop hurting everyone that loves me, but most importantly I want to stop hurting myself. I used to love myself. Oh by the way I have recently purchased so much onlyfans and cam website bullshit that I'm in quite a bit of trouble. I'm 34 by the way.

Honestly, while it may not seem like much, considering what others on here go through and what demons they're fighting, this is mine. My day is wake up, brush teeth, get dressed, have breakfast with either at least 2 16oz bottles, or 3-4 12oz cans, or a large fountain drink with a refill if I eat out. If I eat lunch I'm drinking diet coke. When dinner rolls around, diet coke. And that's not counting all the diet coke I drink whenever I get thirst throughout the day. All said, if I'm not paying attention (which I'm usually not) I can polish off and entire 12 pack of cans in a single day. At my worst, I downed 2 12 packs in about 2 hours. Most of the time, I go out to eat not for the food, but the unlimited refills of soda. I'm currently at the point I'm drinking close to, if not more than, a gallon a day.

I started drinking diet coke daily around 7th grade in middle school when I was struggling to stay awake in class. I'm almost 30 now.

For the longest time this wasn't an issue to me. I wasn't gaining weight. I didn't have kidney stones. I wasn't hyper or jittery. And I could sleep just fine and at a reasonable time. 

What's changed is that I went to the doctor. I was put on medication to combat my depression and ADHD, but because my ADHD is a stimulant it mixes with caffeine poorly and turned me into an insomniac. My metabolism and activity levels aren't what they used to be and now I'm steadily retaining and gaining weight. And I have a very fatty liver.

Also, I personally don't believe it's entirely a caffeine addiction because I have access to unlimited coffee at work and have my own Keurig at home, but I have never desired coffee in the same way and will always choose diet coke over it. I often even have a cup of coffee followed by a diet coke. Yet, I get bored of caffeine free diet coke after a few days because I don't get the stimulation from the caffeine.

I've tried to quit before, but always failed because of a lack of impulse control, the fact nothing else tastes as good, and soda is so readily available. Now, because of doctor's orders and my serious lack of sleep, I have to quit. The issue is, like I said, diet coke so readily available. I can walk into literally anywhere (restaurant, gas station, clothing store, street vendor, walking through a mall, etc) and get a bottle or cup. I go home for a holiday and my parents buy a few 6 packs for me. My friends will pick up a 2 liter or a 6pack for me if they know I'm going to hang out. And that's not even mentioning how much I buy for myself from the grocery store.

What advice is there to combat this addiction when soda is so prevalent and abundant? How do I resist the urge when I can go anywhere and get my fix at anytime?  How do I resist when my friends and family are perfectly fine with giving me more?

[Note: My parents also drink diet coke to get their morning caffeine, but they don't drink more than one or two 16oz bottles a day between the two of them. They only buy the extra so I don't drink their entire supply]",6

I struggle to fight it off, I was young as hell… didn’t know what to do, by the middle of school, I struggled with perversion and pornography a lot,
along with masturbation and that led me to be anti social, low self esteem/confidence & depression. All through out high school I was feeling the same way, I was wondering why girls never wanted to be bothered with me, it’s not cause I’m ugly… ( I know I’m handsome now but back then I thought I was ugly ) it’s because of my confidence and the way I carried myself.

She has battled with addictions before - alcohol, cocaine, heroin, etc. My 2 year old niece currently lives with my mentally unstable, addict sister and her  boyfriend. DCF has already been made aware of this and we are all fighting to get that child out of that house, but they are not acting fast enough.

The thing is, my sister is refusing to let us have emergency temporary custody. She denies her addiction, she blames everything on everyone else. The true words and actions of an addict. I feel so angry at how she has neglected her child and feel so much hatred and resentment towards her right now. She said we betrayed her for trying to take her child away, when in reality, we are looking out for the child AND her. We want her to be a sober, heathy, happy mother, but she doesn’t want to change. She has cut out my family in anger and refuses to speak to us. We worry so much about it the child living in their house, to the point where I feel like I’m going to die from stress induced cardiac arrest. I have heard horror stories of what goes on in her house from a former resident at their home. No child should be living under their roof. It is total chaos and dysfunction. And DANGER. Why won’t DCF take my niece out faster? They already have child endangerment charges due to my niece ingesting a marijuana edible, multiple DCF investigations, and the police has been to their home multiple times.

My sister and her boyfriend are totally out of their mind. Borderline psychotic level. They will call my family at 5 AM because they get into huge violent arguments, and all we can hear is insane screaming. I’m scared when her child gets taken away that she is going to be so distraught that she will either take her own life, or my families. She has implied something like this in the past.

How can someone get through to her and get her help? She refuses to listen to anyone… She loves her child so much, but she can’t care for her when she can’t care for herself. I know the rule “an addict will only change if they want to.” I’m hopeless at this point, I feel that she is too far in.",9

I (F16) have been online friends with K (lets call him) for a year and a half now, and I consider him the best friend I have. Last night, he sent me a text telling me to 'leave and forget him' as his addiction is getting worse and he doesn't want to end up hurting me when reaching that point. I told him it's impossible for me to just forget him and I'll be okay to handle anything that happens. I would much rather stay and help than abandon him. I sent him two texts last night in response to his, basically explaining how I care about him too much to leave and I'll be here to help him anytime he needs.

He hasn't responded yet and I've been terrified all day; what if he's cut himself off because I refused to? God, I don't know what I would do without him. I spent a significant portion of my day researching ways to help a friend with addiction, but it's been tricky since he never specified what his addiction actually is to. So I thought I would come and ask on this subreddit to hear opinions from different people. Any advice is welcome!! Thank you :)

This has been going on for 10+ years. In and out of 3 different rehabs during that time and still keeps going back to the pills. Lately he has been abusing gabapentin and Kratom (supposedly). As of lately, it’s gotten really bad to the point where he showed up to work high as fuck off of Percocets to the point he was falling asleep standing up and his eyes rolling back so he got fired. Just today, he took over 40mg of Percocets within the morning time.  It was to the point that he was a complete zombie and we were worried he would just overdose. He keeps saying he’s going to stop and he wants to for the last 6 months but then we find out 2 minutes later he pops more. We talk to him and he’s a complete pathological liar. At this point, we don’t know what will help. He’s getting thrown out of his apartment tomorrow and his family isn’t letting him go back to their house because they’re fed up with all of his lies. Is there any hope?? What can we do? Or is he just completely fucked?",10

I'm a college student home for the summer, and a couple months ago I decided that this summer I would make some dramatic changes to my lifestyle. I made my first attempt to quit all 3 of my addictions at once - nicotine, gambling, and masturbating. I know, total degenerate. 

Anyways, trying to handle so much at once probably wasn't a good way of managing my addictions, so of course I was back to my old habits in less than a week. So instead I told myself I would take things one step at a time, and start simple with giving up gambling. I figured I'd build some good habits, learn a little bit of impulse control, and be in a good spot in a few weeks to start quitting everything else. Well, it started to work, but about a week into quitting nicotine I started to feel really, really depressed. I didn't eat anything, didn't want to go out to hang out with friends, barely even came out of my room. I hated myself. So I relapsed. 

And then the cycle repeated again. Quit, fell back into a depression, and relapsed. 

I just want to be normal again. I want to go back to when I had confidence and good mental health and wasn't fucking up my body and my bank account just for a little instant gratification. But I keep trying to get clean and I fail and I hate myself for fucking up something so simple. I feel shitty for not being able to do something that functional people just get up and do every day. I know I have the potential for a good future ahead of me. I have an job lined up. I have good supportive friends. I have a mom who loves me and would do anything to keep me safe and happy. But if I don't quit soon, my addictions are still going to be in control of my life and everything I have going for me in the future could come crashing down. I need help, I don't know how to quit.",6

He has been to jail many, many times and in prison three times, never for drugs but for stupid crap he did while under the influence of them. He does meth intravenously, almost never does any other drug. I'm not a healthcare professional but I think he is prob pretty severely depressed. When he was in prison he was put on antidepressants and during those periods of time he would talk about not going back to drugs once he got out, but he always failed to follow up with a doctor to get medication refills so he ends up depressed again and goes back to meth to self medicate.

He knows I can't stand drugs, especially meth because when I was 16 my ex tried to kill me while he was on meth (long story and not the point of this post but yeah). So every time he starts using again he starts distancing himself from me and we will go months without talking, we'll text or meet up every now and again but it's just awkward and I can tell he's strung out. I can't give him an ultimatum or threaten to walk away because he will always choose meth. He honestly doesn't feel like he has any reason to quit, and feels like he has nothing to lose. He literally doesn't care whether or not he goes back to prison, he doesn't care about losing me or even losing his 10 year old daughter over this shit.

Like honestly I don't even think he cares if he dies. I'm terrified that he will have a heart attack from doing so much meth, or catch a dangerous disease from using dirty needles, or even get murdered living this kind of lifestyle (he's already been shot once and  that didn't phase him at all). I just feel like he is so depressed that he's willing to put up with all of this just to not have to deal with negative feelings. Most of the people he did drugs with when we lived together have quit, including his daughter's mother which I'm super happy about because baby girl deserves to have at least one parent she can live with instead of being shuffled around between aunts and grandparents. It breaks my heart that he is not even willing to quit for her (I mean I guess I just have to accept that I'm not good enough to make him want to quit, but his daughter should definitely be, especially this kid in particular who is one of the sweetest people I've ever come across).

I don't even know what I'm asking specifically, I just don't know what to do and I can't just stop caring about him because I've tried to do that and all it did was make me more sure that I can't give up on him.",4

My mom buys me whatever I want when we’re shopping, with mostly no questions. Still, when I see a small item I want that can easily fit my pocket, I’d choose to do that instead. **Let me tell you why.**

Unlike my mom, my dad gets irritated when I pick up stuff from the store and asks him to buy it for me. Whatever it is, even if it’s just 1$, he always has to ask me “Why do you need that? What are you going to use it for? You’re buying stuff you don’t need!” which makes me believe that what I want isn’t worth buying, because it’s “unnecessary”. Sure, I can make my parents buy me stuff I don’t use at times, but most of the time I use the stuff I get. My dad is very strict with earning and saving money, and is careful with deciding what he buys. **To avoid my dads questioning, I often choose to steal my items.**",4

I did everything I could to support him.  I fed him when he couldn't afford food.  I helped him with his daughters letters.  I helped him with his streaming.  I tried waking him up for work.  I found a place for him to get help with his drug addiction.  He lied to me, took me for granted, stole from me, refused to communicate, refused to listen to me. Didn't put in the effort to make things right when I agreed to start over and take things slow.  He'd ignore me for hours, especially when he was with friends.  I was his rock, he even said I was the only person being nice to him and I've done more than enough with helping him out and he will repay me 1 day. 

So why wasn't I enough for the effort? 

This was my final farewell to him:

I know you've lied to me.  I know you're still doing drugs.  I know that when you put your phone in on buy back that day you went and bought drugs.   I don't know why you've decided to play me and try and keep me around.  But I'm done.  I deserve better than this. Especially after everything I've tried to do for you and it all just been thrown back in my face, I just wanted to be happy with you and you meet me half way but drugs are too important to you.  Enjoy your life the way you want to because I can't help you and I'm walking away knowing that I've tried my hardest with us, so I'm happy to leave things as they are now.

He then messaged me on Instagram something like this:

Why bother sending me a long ass message only to block me, who gave you this vital information that you're throwing at me

I ignored it, he got his friend to message me asking to unblock him, I said no. 

He messaged me again on Instagram:

Good one for blocking me, makes it easier for me not to talk to you.  I dont care, I just wanna know who you've been speaking to. 

I've ignored and blocked him from there too. 

I know I've done the right thing and I'm not ever gonna go there again.

He is already at rock bottom he doesnt have a penny to his name, is at risk of losing his place, can't pay bills, his car is now illegal, he hasnt got money for a contact centre to see his daughter.  He sold his phone and the money he got from it was used on drugs, do you think that me finally leaving, will finally get him to sort himself out? And maybe realise what he's lost?",2

I had to undergo anesthesia, and it was really triggering. 

First of all, I was super excited to be put under anesthesia because of the feeling I knew I would experience. I suffer from some level of depression always, and I think I always have found the “escape” from drugs super appealing. I like being unconscious so whether it be from napping or from drugs, I have way overdone these things. Ive had addiction issues with all sorts of drugs, but I’ve been drawn to sedating drugs because I like to escape my feelings or feel dead or something.

When I finally did experience the anesthesia it did feel super good to feel it “hit” me and I can’t stop thinking about it and how it felt similar to opiates when I was younger. I love the sedating effect of it and I miss it. I really hate this and I can’t stop thinking about it. As soon as the anesthetic was hooked up the to IV I could feel it taking over me and it felt super good until I went unconscious and I really loved it. I feel like I want to find something similar now and don’t know why just a medical procedure has fucked me up so bad. I’m even on naltrexone for my food addiction (bulimia) and alcohol problems which the anesthesiologist asked me about but this doesn’t seem to help with these particular urges.

I'm extremely impulsive, depressed, anxious, sick in general but I will give it my best.

I don't have any interests or hobbies because I've been depressed my whole life, I have no skills or education, I'm super lazy and physically weak, I don't really enjoy anything, I have a lot of attention issues and executive dysfunction symptoms and a lot of cognitive decline (that started before I was ever dependent, in fact, since childhood) and honestly I can't learn anything or even watch a series and be interested enough not to wander off to my own thoughts or to the void.

I don't want to feel like I'm depriving or punishing myself for quitting and I feel there should be something great I should be able to reward myself with for my efforts that doesn't ultimately become part of the problem.

I also wish I could turn my obsessions and impulses towards things like work (because im very broke which is why I want to quit and turn my life around, I spend too much money on weed, cigarettes, expensive/unnecessary food and things like that) or working out or cleaning the house or self-care or studying a subject. But it never works because also my dysfunctions are not fully identified and definitely not solved.

For now I've thought of turning to things like asmr, rain sounds (which I really like), sleeping if possible, guided meditation, deep breathing, driking water if possible, showering etc when cravings get hard but I don't see those things as rewards especially not to the level things like drugs or sugar and fat can be.

P.S: I've done and am constantly tempted to do all types of drugs, I just don't currently use any other than weed and tobacco on a daily basis, which is the problem.",9

------

so, i know a lot of people feel like ""fuck drugs, and let the users die"" so PLEASE if that's how you feel, please just don't post. I never met a user who wasn't trying to kill feelings they didn't have the ability to deal with, and they're suffering before they're using, so just. I get it. Let's move on past that to the story, please. I can't emotionally deal with hearing ""users should die"" right now. My kids are almost 30 and I've seen them go through too much for too long to hear that they should've died when in the throes of addiction. Please don't do that.

So, my middle kid, aged 26, is a recovering addict and has been clean for years, but almost died twice in his own past. Today at his job he saw a car in the parking lot with people gathered around, and approached to ask what was going on and see if he could help. EDIT: I asked him for more details and he said actually a guy approached him and said he thought someone had a heat stroke so my son went over.

The driver of the vehicle was blue and passed out and had fresh track marks. My son asked the girlfriend, doped out in the passenger seat, what was going on and she said she had narcan but didn't call 911 because the car wasn't registered and she had dope on her and was scared. My kid slapped the guy and poured water on him to try to revive him, gave him the narcan dose, and called 911, while reassuring the girlfriend that in an overdose situation, at least in our state, you won't be arrested. The ambulance arrived and they administered another dose of narcan and got the guy conscious and thanked my son for what he did. The guy would've been dead without his intervention, and the girl would've had the guilt of his death on her, which could very well have led to her own OD out of guilt.

My kid is shook, I'm shook. He has tried to stay away from all users for the years he's been clean, but he couldn't just do nothing. I'm proud of him. But for some reason this has become an emotional day for all of us.

I guess I'm just sharing because I don't have many people to talk to about this. And also because in a lot of states you can get Narcan for free at CVS or other pharmacies and keep it in your car and maybe save a life. I get that maybe you don't think user's lives are worth saving, but I feel like everyone deserves a chance to figure their shit out. One of my sons has. One of my sons hasn't.

I'm going to get a narcan kit after work tomorrow for my own car. I almost lost my kid years ago to this shit, I don't want to see someone else lose theirs because nobody did anything to try to help, because their kid OD'd at the wrong time in the wrong place, I guess.

anyway. thanks for listening.",66

I guess since being around people like that and doing it it becomes all you think about, lucky now that I’m at my grandmas I haven’t done anything because I respect her and don’t wanna disappoint her, I’ve still got a bit of weed in my grinder and my mind keeps telling me to finish it, maybe I’ll feel slightly more relieved once I do? Also selling smokes at work and seeing people smoke makes my mind crave it even moreeee. 

Will this feeling ever go away? Any advice on how I can stop the cravings would be appreciated.",10

I just want to be off all these pills prescription or not,"(18M) Today Ive reflected a lot on how bad I fucked up during the last year. I Fucked up today and realized this one year fuck up has to end soon.

I'm on a valium taper .. But I have to say I cant remember what being ""sober"" is like, it's been almost 1 year now that I've been always on mostly benzos or opioids and always a bit a weed a bit of vyvanse in there too, always just drugseeking doing pill runs at parties with some friends. But I'm the one that FUCKED up.

I have been either benzos or opioids (mostly benzos) and a bit of alcohol sometimes mixed) or through their withdrawals for the better part of a year now. I Started 3 years ago but slowly it crept up on me as I enjoyed xanax and valium and last July ever since I stocked up old ""stolen"" Pharma Valium Xanax and Klonopin, that's when it stopped becoming occasional.

Then I would order bromazolam, norflurazepam, phenazepam, ap238 and 237 and even phenobarbital as I ran out from my pharma stock.

It's not even that I ""Hate being sober"" but I can't. I can't remember feeling good sober for almost a year now, because of my anxiety + drug dependence, looking at my own snap memories says the same, I miss my sober self. Being sober and feeling ""fine"" -ish. I usted to work at McDonald's and would take a small dose of Buprenorphine equivalent to around 10-20mg of oxycodone just to get through work, I never went sober. Making excuses for using it literally every day I worked. 

I've always really had anxiety and was born with a lot of phobias and a bad vagus nerve that makes me pass out often and probably comes down to my ""mental illness""  but my anxiety mostly got bad around puberty, mostly social anxiety, normal as this is when the vagus nerve starts to lose function (a nerve which can literally control depression and anxiety vs feeling happy and optimistic) my puberty really increased this GAD, social anxiety, insomnia and Panic disorder, Im diagnosed and prescribed Gabapentin Quetiapine and Mirtazapine for that.

*BUT* I relapsed today, yesterday and some other days with some Ketazolam. I make the excuse that I needed a higher dose than my Valium taper, I even used Lorazepam a few times. 

Ever since i admitted to self medicating ..improperly . with benzos, to my family (In Spain living with grandma, mom, dad, uncle and sister) and I now have a psychiatrist specialized in addiction treatment ""helping"" me with my taper.

I have had like 10 or more benzo withdrawals and 2 opioid withdrawals in the last 12 months, I would tell everyone around me it was just my insomnia making me lazy or crazy, as I went dead through my withdrawals, truly suffering like a fucking brain aneurysm. withdrawing and **kindling** my brain with the constant withdrawal/relief over and over.

 I bought a car too, and I've hit it 3 times now, first a fat rocky curb, then I hit a curb on a left turn that fucked my right axle, then the third time it was totaled as I hit a fire extinguisher. I was on benzos and or opioids every single time I crashed and 2 of those times on my phone ish. My fucked up self also made me gain friendships and relationships and destroyed others. It's been a different rollercoaster every fucking week.

I miss being sober. My Normal. I want to quit all my prescriptions and maybe use something as needed for anxiety. My taper is still going to take a while, im still at 20mg of valium (on only half the fucking days as I relapse like a dumbass but I plan on stopping those acts) 

Tomorrow im meeting with that psychiatrist for my taper, and I'm going to tell him about switching meds to something else as valium doesn't seem to give me a very long lasting effect, and I shouldn't notice any w/d symptoms like psychosis or that extreme anxiety while tapering correctly.

How bad did I fuck up ... someone give me advice ... I'm going to relapse and buy Valium tomorrow, but i swear it's the last time..
 
*I need addiction help ... benzos fried those GABA-A receptors I had and they give way too much relief from anxiety ..* This whole topic is something my friends don't even know they just suspect I use occasionally and I'm just an anxious insomniac when I'm in withdrawal.. My life is a lie. Except to myself, I guess. I never really took time to reflect on how bad I've fucked up. Occasional use can turn to daily use if you are not careful, fuck me and be careful you guys.

TL;DR I have been fucked up or in withdrawal, but mostly drugged up for ONE year now, I miss my sober self so much it makes me want to cry. This is my first time talking/writing about this fuckup that I just can't admit to anyone. I fucked up.",9

I stopped...,"I've been in a spiral again the previous weeks.  I had successfully stopped for over half a year. I recently moved home, back to old friends, and well. Here I am, once again, daily use for the past few weeks and I'm slipping bad.

Things aren't bad for me.  I have a career, I'm in the 10th percentile in the UK and under 30, I've worked hard for it and earned it. I have investments that put my portfolio where most would say they had made it, people see me as the successful one, the one who made it, the clever one who knows what they're doing, the one who had it all worked out long ago. But life isn't good.

My mental health is wrecked, I'm suffering inside, I can't think straight and it's going to start affecting my work very soon. I look rough, though I always have (bad childhood. I can't blame my parents, it's not their fault, it stems to a parents childhood), my breath is suffering from the addiction (dry mouth) which has drastic affects on my social anxiety, I don't like being around people anymore. I can't be myself. My nose is ruined and as such, is my voice. I'm always stuffy. 

I can go on and on and on. But what good does that do? All these thoughts daily. At 9am for work, I'm rough. I slack. But my work is done and nobody questions it. By mid-afternoon, some food and a nap, I'm recovered, I still feel the regret. Though once work is done and the day is over, I feel fresh. And hey, what else is there to do? Fuck it. Get one more.  And the cycle repeats. Lay awake at 2am wondering what in the fuck you've done, one more fucking time. 

In my real low point, I was suicidal.  I had thoughts every day the only way to end this addiction was to end it all. I can feel this returning. 

I need to end this cycle badly. I did break it. I can do it again. But it has to start somewhere. It has to start today. Mushrooms helped me break it last time, I just need the opportunity to take them again. I'm slowly cutting ties.

Well here goes. Today I stop.",2

EDIT: as of posting this update, I forgot to mention, I visited my mom and told her about my addiction and how I finally ended it.

let me add onto this by saying a year ago i was also addicted to a variety of drugs such as acid, xans, and percs to the point where i ended up overdosing. dont really remember much but i had bought 30 xan bars and when i woke up in the hospital after being in a coma like state for a couple minutes i got the news that i had taken heroin laced bars, and ended up taking all 30 in under a day. since then ive only stuck to weed, acid and nicotine.

i only smoke weed about 2-3 times every week now and i dont do acid very much, usually i buy 10 tabs about every other month then go through them in about a week.

but besides all that the only thing i havent been able to quit using on a daily basis is nicotine, recently switched to using bangs which are 60mg disposables and have about 2000 hits in them. i go thru 1 in about 3 days, sometimes 4. despite all this i still manage to go to work everyday and i always find myself having to sneak a hit every 5 minutes or i simply dont get anything done.

other than me buying really addicted to it i really dont think its harming my brain in any way, really hard to tell because after i overdosed i lost most of my abilities to remember or think. at school i get distracted very easily and get overwhelmed when i think too hard about something.

looking for advice on how i can quit, willing to buy any product if it can help. thanks to anyone who is willing to help and read thru this",5

I wanted to post a heads up that about a user who posts here frequently claiming to be a psychology expert.

They run a blog and frequently post what appear to be helpful comments that link back to their blog. It looks legitimate at first, because some of the info is from reputable sources, but a lot isn't, or based in harmful misinformation, so it may be worth verifying. 

They also run a borderline abusive subreddit, r/responsiblerecovery.

Given the nature of this subreddit,  I wanted to alert others of their predatory comment history, in case users come across it.

Thanks and have a great day!

Edit: Some people seem to think i'm trying to convince them to do something, i'm not. This post is informational, so people can be aware and judge for themselves, since they post a lot under the auspices of advice. They seem to focus on support-type subreddits, which is why it felt important to put out a warning. As always, see for yourself and make your own judgements.",35

I was so deep into addiction. I really didn't think I could get out. It took everything I had in me to beat it, but it was so worth it. These days I'm happy to live a normal life. With out the hustle everyday and thought of drugs. Sick when I can't find or have spent all my money. Just a normal life. It feels so good to have made it to the other side. Do whatever it takes to get clean. If you fail, try again. Never feel bad for trying to get better or relapsing. No matter what, just keep pushing forward. You wont be disappointed when you finally leave all of it behind and start a new life. Good luck to anyone facing addiction. And for those actively trying to quit, know you can make it. Don't let it trick you, that one more day could make all the difference in the world. Everyday you tell it no, you add to your strength and start becoming a better you.",12

TW: I talk about addiction here, just a very vulnerable monologue flow of conscience thingy. 

First of all, I'm a 19 male from South America, so trust me I'm not high I'm just not a native english speaker. I'm a person who gets addicted to anything quite easily, I take full responsibility for it. 

I'm prescribed antidepressants since I'm 16 and recently got started on Ritalin. I have a problem with any drug that acts quickly and Ritalin is one of them. 

I'm so afraid to mess it up and turn this into a addiction and to be honest I'm halfway there. It is very frustrating cause I have an ADHD diagnosis and this is the one thing that can help me right now; but I'm so reckless with any mind altering substance. I just can't trust myself around prescription drugs anymore and the fact that I never saw anyone with this problem in this sub makes me feel like a soon to be junkie.

When I take it as it is prescribed, it feels like I'm there and able to feel a lot of emotions. I'm more talkative and sociable, a lot more productive and focused too. It really helps me. I want it to help me. 

Does anyone went thru this at my age? What are your tips on building responsibility and straight up taking better care of yourself? 

I'm so frustrated and lost with this, just noticed it is so out of topic with the sub.

I don't want to feel like I'm about to turn into a junky when I get my refill but I also don't want to just ignore this issue cause it will eventually get me.

Took 200mg on the last 20 hours. I feel so embarrassed now, it's 4AM and I'm chainsmoking outside my house feeling lost. I have no self control. I would love to get advice from people that went through this. I literally don't know what to do, don't wanna open up to anyone I know. 

I'm not open about this to anyone anymore. My friends think I got better, or just take it as a joke cause I often joke about this. 

I don't know if this will sound weird but I would love to have an older and more experienced people that I could talk to about it with no shame, I don't want my parents to know I took 10x my prescription. I want them to trust me. They would help me but I would feel so embarrassed.

An older figure with ADHD, like, a mentor (counselor? idk) or someone that struggled with addiction. Someone I could talk to that been through it. I want advice, help and feeling understood. I'm embarrassed to look for help of people I know. I just want someone to be there when I feel things getting out of control. My parents wouldn't get it, again, I don't want them to think I'm going Loco. 

I'm going to bed now, tomorrow will be a good day. I have to send an old 3DS I sold online and I'm looking forward to it lol bit worried about finding a box to put it. I felt so good writing this, don't want to hold on to this anymore, writing about repressed thoughts feels like building a puzzle but the puzzle I'm building is on fire cuz it is in English. Hope y'all have a good week, take good care of yourself and show love to the ones you love!!! that's my advice, feeling loved and remembered can change my day, it is so powerful that we can do this to someone. 

please be truthful, i wrote this mainly to know if this is as bad as it seems to me. wake up calls and ear pulls are allowed!!! your reply is important to me, i wanna talk about this. be kind.",2

So I got to a point where I would ride my bike 5 miles everyday down to PJ's house we would have a blast just doing random s*** one day we went to a park Edgewood and there's a kid swinging on the swing set PJ was like oh that's Chad don't make fun of him or anything. Im like make fun of him.
Yeah he's a little special. Well my uncle special needs as well so no hatred came for me so we started hanging out with Chad who lives about three blocks away from PJ's house eventually Chad sister started hanging out Brittany but me I tend to lean towards the older crowd and Britney's mom I would hit on there and flirt you know kind of being a mom eventually one day she got a boyfriend name Danny and I was always down in the dumps depressed cuz I was a teenager and one day I was just hanging out with Chad's mom and her boyfriend and they went into the room and she was wondering why I was so upset her boyfriend looks over says he feels left out I knew they was doing something drug-related in the room I had my share of weed and alcohol but nothing quite like what would take 7 years of my life away he turns to me and he says do you want to hit it with the most compassionate voice reaching out to me and as a boy that had no father I looked up to him like he was even though he didn't deserve that title. But me being a 16 year old I was I looked at him and I said sure I knew meth was bad but in my mind I thought s*** just one time do the time span of a month I started to hang less and less with PJ and more and more with Danny. Danny would take me to all the drug houses and tell everyone that I was a child that just recently was able to see him even though that was a lie he portrayed himself as my father God knows he spent more money on me than my dad ever did looking back on it I wish she didn't spend any on me because all the money that you spent on me was meth all the houses that I used to go to they all see me as his son he even lied to his sister and said I was a son and she believed him my memory is fuzzy but I recall walking hours and hours with this man he portrayed himself as my father but in reality he was my demon two years pass he eventually got locked up for killing a girl around this time I was sober I don't know what happened but it's like I hopped on a sled going down the hill when my goal was to to be at the top of the hill I surely wish I never took that first hit because my memory is fuzzy from everything that's happened but I be called perfectly that first time the atmosphere the way he portrayed himself as a person that would guide me to better things if you love somebody you would never give them something that will consume their life I've ruin relationships just because I'd forget to text what check up on them my whole life is more regret then satisfaction I'm high right now as I write the story hoping that me typing it out will get it through my head that this drug is killing me not only the drug but the behaviors the Lac of love that I feel I never saw it as a problem until about 2 years ago when I realized after 20 times of flushing my stash saying it would be the last time it seems to never be the last time it's like I'm in a never-ending Circle truly becoming my biological father something that I dread but the reality is I'm just like him I try to have acceptance but I just can't rest with it peacefully I have a problem meth is so stigmatized I'm afraid to ask for help I'm afraid to be known as an addict even though I've been living attic life for 7 years I throw away a fire certification I'm certified to be a firefighter and Hazmat I could have saved lives I coulda I coulda those words always go through my head instead of I did it's always I could have I wish I could have never taken it never gave in to a father-like figure who I thought was trying to do the best for me just because he was an adult but let's be honest adult is stupid and Liars and we all only care about our own feelings whether we like to admit it or not my name is Brandon Carroll Gibson and I am a addict",2

He is currently 21 but he started at 16/17 ish. My parents are kind of orthodox (not a lot but a bit I guess) and I think I’m too young to have much of an opinion (16 btw). I still think that he is doing it WAY to often. My parents have even said before that they are somewhat okay with it as long as it’s in moderation. They’ve allowed him to do it once or twice a week and tried many things like so but almost every time he ends up breaking the commitment and ends up getting caught (god knows how many times he wasn’t).His friend group also smokes quite often (some doing it 2-3 times A DAY) which is definitely not helping as friend groups can heavily influence at this age. More recently, he commited to not doing it for a bit and we found out he had been doing it for 2 weeks straight after lying to our faces multiple times. Also gets caught after lying endlessly. Almost as if he could be considered a pathological liar tbh. He wants to move out by August with some of his more problematic friends but I’m not sure what to do. I can already see the negative affects on his health such as weaker lungs, brain development damage (not kidding), even a doctor test said he has low testosterone. Any advice???",3
2021-07-14 02:14:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ojyban/klonopin_withdrawal_intervention_advice_needed/,"klonopin withdrawal & intervention, advice needed","Hi, I haven't really been on here long and I don't use reddit, but I'm in a really tough situation. I've been on a steady dose of Klonopin via prescription for a few years. I'm supposed to take 1mg per day, but I reallocate it and take larger doses at times and then go through heavy withdrawal for a few days before taking another large dose. I've been going through this for two years now, but my psychiatrist is titrating down after finding out about how I've been taking it via my mom and therapist who staged a small intervention today.

I've struggled with addiction throughout my teenage life. Ambien, klonopin, nic, etc., and the idea of not having Klonopin available to me *at all* is terrifying to think about. When my ambien prescription ended I had a months long crisis and I still miss it three years later. I've heard before: ""once an addict, always an addict,"" and for me this has always seemed to ring true. I can't even comprehend the idea of stopping, but I know I have to get clean at some point.

I'm going into my Freshman year of college and I'm going to be taking on a large course load. I was basically relying on the euphoric/relaxing nature of Klonopin to help me relax and focus.

My therapist suggested Valium to help with the withdrawal and then cutting benzos all together but...I just can't imagine life without them at this point.

I had some sort of psychotic episode last night, and now I feel like this is just someone pulling a rug out from under me on top of all of it. 

I don't know if this is very comprehensible...I've been considering rehab, but it would interrupt my college plans.

tl;dr: does anyone have advice on starting to accept going clean? I feel forced into it, and totally hopeless.",2

My parents had left the house for the weekend and I had the house to myself... my brother and sister were both working all weekend so they were only home at night time. So during one of the days where I was alone, I called up an old dealer and I had ordered a dab pen because of the lack of smell in my room and smell on my clothes. I order the weed and about 2 hours later I get a call from my dealer and he said he was outside.

I leave my house and get the pen from my guy. I go inside I charge the pen and after 40 min I unplug the pen and start to toke up. It had been 7 MONTHS since I touched weed and after 1 hit I had felt so High it felt great and horrible at the same time, it was bittersweet. And that is all I had done that day was just locked in my room smoking the pen.

This was the best I had felt in a while and this continued another day after that, my day looked the same, me sitting in my room getting high. Today I mustered enough courage to put the pen down the sewer in front of my house and I regret doing that also because deep down I really want to get high still, but on the other hand, I don't want to get back into my old ways of being a looser. I feel defeated and my craving for weed right now is so high I cannot sleep and I'm sweating thinking about it.

Although alcoholism runs in my family i didnt touch it until i was 19 when i first got drunk...even then i wasnt doing it as much. When i tunred 21 i would go to college parties and get drunk but that was just a phase and wasnt doing it during the week or when i was class or work....

&#x200B;

by 23 i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression but i didnt go on meds and instead went to therapy/cousneling in dealing with this. Surprisingly this is when i stopped drinking as well. 

at 27 i moved out, was in the middle of a 3 year break from college and was working 70-75 hours a week. I began having bad insomnia and i began to drink wine before bed...Also this was also when i began to gain weight and continued until last year. I went from 195 to 220lbs...this was in 2019. 

2020 rolls around and i decided to quit one of my jobs and go back to college. But obviously, the pandemic happened and my anxiety was at an all time high, quarantined also made my depression  worse since i wasnt going out and not being able to go see my friends. I wasnt eating and not feeling well. This resulted in me dropping 15lbs in less then a month without trying. Got blood work done and was told it was all due to stress but yet i physically felt sick. He prescribed me meds but refused to take them.  This is when i began to smoke weed very heavily. I was high 24/7 from the moment i woke up to when i went to bed. I was missing work and i didnt care about anything. 

&#x200B;

Now weed has helped me enormously for my anxiety but the way i began using it was just overdoing it. 

this was going on about May of 2020...a year later it hasgotten worse. I ended up quitting my job due to wanting to focus on school full time for a year. grade wise i have been doing good. I did dropped 2 classes last semester due to feeling burnt out of online classes but i still did pretty well. I got a 3.0 gpa even tho it had been 3 years since i was in school.

&#x200B;

but i was also high 100% of the time during class. 

ATM im taking the summer off but this is mainly due to nit being able to afford taking summer courses.

but now im just at home smoking all day. My anxiety has gotten bad again and im starting to not eat again.

&#x200B;

i do workout almost everyday and  it has helped me maintain the weight that lost and even more. In total ive lost almost 40lbs which obviously people have noticed i looked different but what they dont know is that even tho i look good outside, inside im screwed up. 

&#x200B;

Ive started to smoke way too much again. I wake up anxious every morning and immediately smoke before i even have breakfast and usually i don't even eat breakfast or ill have coffee to get the buzz from the caffeine which mix with the THC makes me feel more energized without the caffeine making me anxioius. However,  My high lasts about 2-3 hours max and im smoking as soon as i feel like my high is coming down or if i feel my anxiety coming back. 

i know what im doing is just numbing my anxiety and depression without facing my problems and fears head on but idk how to do that. The anxiety makes me feel weak, on edge, my mind starts racing overall sick. 

the other day i caught myself smoking all day and couldnt remember the last time i went a day without smoking and just be sober. and tbh i dont want to think about trying to be sober. 

&#x200B;

do you think i have a problem? i mean it's just weed right? Alcohol is worse and anxiety meds can make your life a living hell if you get addicted to those.",2

Addiction fueled my social energy but now In sobriety I’m mentally exhausted all the time and it’s manifesting itself in a form of terrible fatigue. I have no energy to get on the phone and speak to people back to back for 8 hrs, it’s mentally draining, especially when customers can be rude and flat out assholes. I refuse to compromise my sobriety for the job because I know if I stayed on the addiction path I’d be dead by now but damn I don’t want ppl to think I’m lazy but Im just not mentally and socially equipped for this in the early stages of recovery.

Anyway I’ll get straight into it. I’ve (18F) struggled with mental health problems since I can remember, but when I was 14/15 things really took a turn when I got into a verbally abusive relationship which completely knocked my confidence, and by the end I felt so  worthless that I took an attempt on my own life. I ended up hospitalised for a few months in a mental health ward but was released a few months before my sixteenth birthday. This is when I think everything got harder for me because I had all these unresolved emotions still from that relationship and the breakup that I couldn’t handle , so weed became a vice for me. It started as only smoking before bed but soon turned into a routine of smoking all day every day, and any time I try to go without I get extremely cranky and tearful. This has been going on for probably 2 years so all in all as much as I hate to admit it , I know I’m addicted. 
Lately I’ve been trying to cut back down again but it’s more difficult than I thought because I’m realising that all the emotions I had before I started smoking, are still there. I’m so frustrated at myself because I’m realising that this whole time I thought smoking was helping me , it’s just been disguising how I really feel.
At the moment I just feel completely lost because I know continuing with my habit isn’t going to do me any good, but on the other hand I don’t know if I’m strong enough to cope with all of the suicidal feelings and the emotions that would come with quitting. I know that they wouldn’t last forever and I’d find light at the end of the tunnel but my worry is that I wouldn’t be able to reach that point without doing something silly beforehand. 
I don’t know what I expect out of this post, I think in a way it just feels a bit better to let it all out. I don’t really have any friends I can talk to about this sort of thing and I don’t want to make my family or my partner (18M) worried.

Also might be important to add that I live with my dad (54M) and he smokes aswell.",1

I see all of this. I know all of this, yet I don't know if I care enough to not relapse. Sometimes I feel so detached from myself. It's like an out of body experience. It's like I have no control over myself, yet I recognize how wrong I am and have incredible insight into it.

I've been drinking heavily since I was 13 (I'm 17 now) and I honestly didn't remember what it was like not getting drunk almost every single day until this week when I had my wisdom teeth removed and was forced to sober up so it could heal. Five days, longest I've lasted in months, maybe over a year.

Of course, I'm drinking now. But in all honesty, I'm still sober. I haven't had enough to be drunk. But it was just enough to get me thinking about the rest of my life.

Alcohol isn't all I use. I also do a notorious stimulant. And I'm gonna be an adult soon, I'm going to have to move out and get a car and be responsible and all that fun junk. And I want to. I want to finally get away from my mother and be my own person. But that can't happen this way.

Being sober this week has reminded me what it's like to not be sick all the time. It was nice. While it lasted. But now, I'm gonna go back like always. And I'll waste away the prime years of my life like this. When will it be enough to finally call it quits? Never, apparently.

I just wish I could wake up tomorrow without this burden that has become so routine that having to break it for even just a few days is a shock. I wish I could wake up like I did before, where this wasn't constantly hanging over me like gnats on a sultry summer day.

Recently, I realized my drinking was beginning to go off the deep end. I have not developed any physical dependency, but have used it at a rate that would lead to that eventually.  Then, I began taking medication that both has higher risks while using nicotine, and is also less effective while using nicotine. I cut down on my nicotine use, and cut down on drinking slightly. Until this evening, I went a weekend without nicotine, and a full 24 hours with no alcohol (my longest in a very long time).  

However, I now find myself pressured to find a new job, as I will end up relocating to a new area. As it stands, my marijuana use is the one thing that will actually prohibit me from acquiring a new job. I've been able to abstain from weed for about 3 days now (the longest in well over 1 year), but I fear abstaining from weed will drive me to drinking and smoking (as it did tonight). 

Should I focus on not smoking cannabis for the short term, in order to get a new job as I need to in order to move with the person I love, but use alcohol and nicotine as a crutch until I am able to lock down a job?  Or should I attempt to abstain from all three at the same time? I do plan on quitting nicotine, but fear trying to do both at once will be overwhelmingly difficult. I also plan on not drinking daily in the future, but would still allow myself to drink within reason.",2

I’ve been struggling with addiction problems for a long time, but right now it feels so out of control that I don’t know how to even start recovering.
I use and I drink almost every day, usually going hand in hand. using makes me need to drink to avoid feeling to up or nauseous. drinking makes me want to use more than I ever do sober, and I don’t even really know why. 
I hate the person I turn into when I’m black out drunk; obviously I don’t remember but I’ve ruined friendships and relationships by being vicious and belligerent when I am. I hate how stressed I get trying to make sure I find time to pick up a handle or a 6 pack to make sure I’ll have something to drink when I get off work. I hate how I get the shakes and so easily annoyed whenever I try to stop for even just a day. 
I hate how I spend SO much money on the substance I use (I haven’t kept count but it’s easily up in the thousands within the past year and a half). I hate how even when it makes me feel sick to my stomach, as soon as I quell that feeling, I immediately want to use again, even though I know it makes me feel awful almost instantly after it makes me feel ‘good’. I hate how much it has affected my health already, and I hate thinking about how it will affect my health worse in the future. 

despite all of that, it feels so impossible to quit. when I try and stay clean for more than 24 hours, alcohol withdrawals get so severe I can’t work, but I can’t call out, so I end up just ‘having a little’ to stop the symptoms. then by the night I end up drinking over half a handle by myself so I can sleep without sweating through the sheets and having nightmares. 
even when I suffer horrible sinus headaches that bring me to tears, and get near daily nosebleeds, I find myself picking up minimum $30 worth a day. 

I want to get better I don’t know how. I’m not religious, I have horrible anxiety that’s made me terrified to go to AA or NA thus far, and because of past mental health problems, I’m terrified of going to the doctor for the risk of potentially being institutionalized (and also the fact that I lack insurance). 

If there’s anyone out there who would maybe feel comfortable emailing, texting, or whatever, I have a lot of questions about resources and ways to get started with recovering… I feel so lost and alone, and even though I want to get better, I don’t know where to start, especially alone…

edit- 
TLDR; I’m struggling to find ways to seek help for recovery (alcohol and substance abuse), and would like to find someone to talk to about my questions and maybe offer resources. 
(also edit: I also have addiction problems with self harm and nicotine, so help with either of those is more than welcome and appreciated)",3

2021-07-12 05:54:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/oio4jo/my_gambling_addiction_story/,My Gambling addiction story.,"tldr: i'm trying to quit gambling because to me gambling = entertainment and self-improvement (and i believe that usefulness as of today has ended)... and i have other sources of entertainment (that i already have paid for) and other self-improvement resources available to me.

Overall losses from 2021 April --July. = $5,000

At first my friend invited me to go to a far away casino simply because he didn't go there yet (not that exciting) Only slot machines. Then on my own i decided to drive to a closer casino by myself just to compare. Then I went there to spend $700 limit (extended to a $800 limit) on trying out different machines and i thought i had made lots of money and have not spent much of it on anything so who knows it might be fun to bet big. Then after that, i decided to bring a paper and pencil and found some fun trying to figure out patterns of how many bets until i hit a considerable UP on a bet. Then kept betting on different machines to see which sounds/visuals/location/overall feeling of when a win is happening or when a lose is happening. Then i kept experimenting with the different options (go to Casino when?? : pre-JOB , post-JOB, off day) to see if they were viable options to feed my entertainment. Throughout all my visits i've been thinking a lot about how much $ to spend and how much TIME to spend to improve how my overall experience would be. Then when i was slightly bored of the Non-smoking area, i ventured into the Smoking area just to see what it looks like (it felt tolerable) which then i saw the ""High limit"" area then i played around with my favorite slot machine Vault (but a high limit version) betted $5/spin then i was tired and wanted to go home so I just $50 max simply to end my night faster and won jackpot $1,700 (pre-tax). (ironically my jackpot win equals the amount of my overall losses at that time). after that feeling of winning, i promised myself that i would stay away from gambling for a while and let the feeling of winning sit with me, but in less than a few days i went gambling again and lost that amount of jackpot (without intention of wanting a jackpot,, it was just intent on seeing if i do get a jackpot or not). Less than a week after that my JOB was offering me extra shifts with a bonus and i slightly reluctantly agreed which even furthered my thinking that it was ok to use for gambling (expected loss) the same amount of money as i was earning. (more than half my losses happened when i have got the opportunity for more $ via JOB, and when i have discovered High-Limit area, and after i started using my Debit/Credit card) Basically I have kept gambling until all available resources (card withdrawal limit / physical bills were all used up).

Throughout my whole gambling experience I have never yearned for a ""jackpot"". I was simply gambling because  each and every visit (it has improved me as a person: $ budgeting, time budgeting, comparison of resources, road driving, street memorization, removed my fear of driving to places at night,  non-gambling activities to do in casino that would enhance experience of gambling etc ...)  while nihilistic towards losses until all my money is gone. Strangely enough, in my head i always thought that if I won $100,000 then with that money, i would use it to go back home and watch TV but i still kept gambling.. On that day when i won the Jackpot, i still kept going using up the smaller bills that was left (saving the big 100 bills). Even after a win, i STILL gambled. For some reason i feel compelled to keep going until it ends (only way it ends is if i have no money left). 

I got to thinking if a win wouldn't change my life, nor will a considerable loss make me care, then why would i do it other than for entertainment ? Other than entertainment, I really do believe that going to casino gambling has made me (for each visit) a better version of myself,,, but at a massive cost). Strange how me (a TV/video game addict) would skip an amazing time for TV/video game session to favor a few hours of gambling. Even worse than the $ lost is the time used up. I have already bought ALL the games i possibly could want, and even then I haven't even started on the ones that are obviously Popular and are reviewed as Great. The worst part is all these other entertainment that is already available to me are being so ridiculously being procrastinated that cements the idea that I will never finish them. Why the hell is it that i'm so easily willing to complete all my available $ to gamble, but not willing to complete my available video games ?

 I believe that this self-improvement via gambling has finished its usefulness. I'm not saying i'm going to stop gambling (as it is entertaining). I'm saying I'm going to stop gambling (until i finished all my already bought video games and list of TV shows that are expected to be entertaining    ,, expected  >1,000 hours long).",3

I had the perfect opportunity to sort myself out but failed miserably. I’m not wallowing in self pity though. I’m dusting myself down to go again. I really appreciate this community and would like to ask a couple of questions/make a couple of points:

Do any of you have successful strategies for coping with urges when they seem to completely dominate your thoughts? Example from yesterday- I was doing fine in the morning and then a single little thought of using popped in to my head. Within minutes my whole mind was consumed with thoughts of using and justifying it to myself. Within a couple of hours I’d taken my pills. How to I stop this process in the first place?

Another reason I think I fail is that I read/listen to/watch things about other addicts and their struggles. What ends up happening is that I think that my addiction isn’t as serious and so I can just continue doing what I do. Is there anything you’d recommend reading/watching that might help inspire change in me?

I appreciate that your experiences are all personal and unique but I’d appreciate any help.

Firstly thank you for reading my post. I'm wondering a couple things about opioid addiction and I was hoping to ask you all some questions about it. They won't be anything too personal or disrespectful I'm just genuinely curious and work with a group of people trying to help addicts and I'd like to learn a bit more.

Just use reddit messages to dm me if you'd like or just comment if you're interested and I can message you instead.

Where peacefulness dies as reality sinks in/
No motivation to move, my grogginess wins/
I must overcome this despair from within/
Before I start thinking of time spent alone/
I toss over my blanket and reach for my phone/
I call, not text, impatient for a reply/
I need this to live, though it helps me to die/
He answers the phone, suddenly my mood shifts/
As soon as I see him, all my despair lifts!/
My troubles irrelevant, my problems? A joke!/
The only thing that matters right now, is coke/
I exit my bed, haven’t showered in days/
And put on my sneakers to exit this haze/
My eyes full of circles, clothes tattered and torn/
I jump in my car and I drive towards the score/
I wait on the corner, fidget in my seat/
And wait like a dog salivating for a treat/
I stare at the corner, and when he arrives/
I open my window, his hand slides inside/
“Top of the morning” he ushers with glee/
I take from his hand a cure to my misery/
Before I can shift my car back into drive/
I’m crushing the rocks to sniff up on the ride/
One bump on the left, one bump on the right/
I sniff off my phone and feel a rush to my mind/
I’m alive! I think, my grogginess gone/
Maybe cocaine wasn’t bad all along/
I start texting friends, there’s plans to arrange!/
When halfway through my bag, I noticed something changed/
I’m no longer elated, my heart starts to race/
I go back to my room, unhappy but safe/
It lasted an hour, my happy escape/
But now I’m too wired, so I must sedate/
The klonopin pills! It’s my only hope/
I open my bottle and take twice my dose/
The anxiety lessens, but realities back!/
I’m groggy again, took too much to relax/
As I write this my eyes start to grow heavy and then/
I reach for my phone and call the coke man again.",52

2021-07-11 10:31:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/oi5hfr/day_1_of_being_sober_for_good/,Day 1 of being sober ... for good.,"In 5th August I stopped drinking as it was slowly taking over my life. A first, the man takes a drink, then, the drink takes the man. So true. 

Since then, I've slowly started increasing my weed intake which means I'm more inclined to smoke cigarettes.... because addiction is a bitch. 

Yesterday, I went to my friends party which was much like mini festival in a field in the middle of nowhere. It was something I've been mildly dreading, because it was the first time I'd been to a real social event since... well... covid happened. So no one actually really knew that I've stopped drinking. I wasnt worried about the not drinking bit, although I went through phases beforehand of... maybe I'll drink... I mustn't drink... maybe just one... too and froing talk (I stuck to my guns and didnt drink), but no, what I was most worried about was telling people that I wasn't drinking. I expected shock, persuasion tactics, the lot. But instead everyone was sooooo supportive. 

I think I overdid the smoking though... but all that support for not drinking made me see that I can do it. I can be sober. People actually like me sober. Whodda thought?? 

Fuck the demons. I will tackle them without drugs from now on. 

So, today marks day 1 of being actively and mindfully sober for good. No booze. No weed. No tobacco. Nada. If I can give up booze which is so prevalent in our society, then I sure as hell can stop smoking too. 

It will he hard... what will I turn to when the days are particularly hard? I'd like to take up running again, but seriously lost motivation since the tar has been filling lungs: that first run I know will be a killer. 

The thing that I will miss the most (you may be surprised to hear, but it isnt the heart palpitations and the 'oh shit, I'm having a heart attack' feeling) but actually sitting outside, quietly, peacefully winding down. Will a cup of tea be enough to wind down with? I dunno. But I've got to try. 

That's it really. Just an announcement post to make it seem more real somehow. 

Oh FYI, I'm a 33yo F, but I think I write like a guy as people always make the assumption that I'm male. I'm not.",15

Literally grinds 6 days a week to work on a warehouse, only to turn around and blow it on cocaine multiple times a week. No education, or driver's license. And still lives with his mommy. He's always going on about how much he hates the drug but then turns around and does it without fail week after week. Doesn't want to enter treatment or do therapy even tho it's free in our country (Canada). 

About a month ago I got fed up with his gaslighting and behaviour and effec9 detached from him and just lived my life. I felt a little bad but it was nice not worrying about him or thinking what he was up too. He broke down and sent me a wall of text 2 weeks ago after a 5 day bender and we reconnected. Bit of a honeymoon phase again as we socialized again on Discord and played a few video games, he seemed set on his sobriety. Last night he bought 6 beers and got some cocaine and he was telling me while he did it, how he feels like he can't quit, he feels good, he deserves it after a 10 day sobriety break. I obviously told him he's just being selfish and he agreed but still went through. I logged off and have since been slightly miffed I keep doing this to myself (getting my hopes up only to have them dashed again). 

I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to cut him out since it would be easier for me mentally but the other part feels bad for him. Anyone have any advice for me?",2

But it's never been worse than now.

I cannot handle my ADHD/ADD when I try and get off the stuff. It's like my brain is only functional when I'm using. I hate that I am a functioning addict. I have every single symptom of ADHD in children and adults to the severe extremes, unless im high. But that's everyday. A gram or more a day. IV. 

I've been using for around 3 years now. I really entered my peak addiction after injecting (""just to try it once"") one year ago. My veins are failing in some places.

 I came here for sobriety. I've been on the waitlist for rehab for more than 10 weeks. My insurance doesn't work here in this state. I've lost all control. Mixing it with Xanax I spent my entire savings in 2 days this weekend. 
I already have like 4 plugs saved in my phone. 

What has worked for you? Anything? I'm seeking answers. I really can't hold on much longer. Just writing this makes me want to get high. It's this cycle that has consumed everything.

I also think it’s extremely likely that they are pressed with fet… very. Ima actually almost positive. I know I’m super stupid for doing shit that I KNOW has fentanyl in it. I’m an idiot. Shit has been really rough right now. I’ve had multiple sexual traumas in the past few years, including being actually full on r*ped. Last year I went through a break up with a ex boyfriend who was emotionally and occasionally physically abusive.

Im gonna start going to NA, but I don’t think I can just make myself stop through sheer will power. I know someone on here said I should go to detox at a hospital. Here are my issues. I can’t take time off of my job! I don’t know if they can pink slip you in detox, but I don’t want to be held there and then im gone from work for 5-7 days with no explanation(im not gonna tell them if im in detox I would get fired). Im fine with lying. I also don’t know what I would tell my parents. That’s also a big issue. Im 22 so I can’t pay out of pocket got going to the hospital, buy my dad has pretty good insurance. I have no idea how I would explain it to them they would be so disappointed but I just really am not sure if I can do it by myself. I also don’t know how addiction treatment works. I’ve always made it out of minor drug problems unscathed so I’ve never been in treatment. Are they going to try and send me to rehab? Do I NEED to be in rehab or is it not too bad that I would need to do that? I think I would maybe have a bit more flexibility for the work think because I got a job offer from a different company that I may take so I could delay starting my job maybe for a bit? Are they gonna put me on methadone? Can I just get that prescribed to me by a doctor or psychiatrist? I really want to straighten out my life. Does anyone have any answers or input?",7

Since I always thought my alcoholism ""wasn't that bad,"" I decided to quit completely on my own-- no therapy, no AA, with just the help of my wife and a couple close friends. 

Strangely, the first five months were much easier than month six. I'm not exactly sure what changed, maybe it's just the ennui of sober life setting in, but I've really started to spiral this month. I think a big reason I drank in the first place is that I have a brain that just doesn't shut off. It's just a non-stop cycle of self-evaluation and criticism. My inner voice is an asshole. I'm caught in this cycle of negativity and I'm really just fed up at this point, so I decided to seek therapy. 

Any recommendations on programs or types of therapy, or specific therapists who do video sessions? Anybody else deal with a relentless self-critic? How do you eventually get them to shut up? Do they ever shut up? Am I just stuck with this guy in my head for the rest of my life?

This is such as sad day to hear the news as he is among the smartest, most ambitious and social people, one of those who could study hard and party hard with great results.

What I heard from his parents was mind-blowing:  he quit medical school, got into a car accident, lost the leased luxury car somehow, and developed a shopping frenzy and substantial debt and is now back to parents home being irritable, delusional and not seeing any friends.

The parent secretly asked me what I knew about his party flavors and that he smells like weed all the time. They are thinking it is cannabis that is making him that way. But I was also aware of Adderall use for doing exams and things started to be strange with him since starting to take the drug.

His recent behaviors such as fast talking, going on and on, sudden mood swings and gigantic reactions and drama to normal events are signs of some sort of amphetamine addiction instead of cannabis.

He has not been answering back my calls for few month (since before I knew) and again did not answer my call and messages. I am worried about him and do feel for my relatives for what they are going through right now seeing their bright child go to abyss in a matter of months. He is not accepting that he has issues and not cooperating with parents. I really want to do something to help the situation. Any advice?

 I'm 20yo, currently in summer break, so I have lots of free time. Sadly I'm a really socially anxious person and I dont have any friend and starting conversations with new people is really hard for me.

&#x200B;

Now about the tittle, recently I have become used to watching one specific cam girl any time she is online, and when she is not my mind will be constantly pushing me to check just in case she is, over and over again. I'm at a point where I feel I have no control over my mind anymore.

I haven't spent any money, but the amount of time and specially the mental stress that this is consting me in problematic, to say the least. And to make mathers worst, I believe the thing I'm addicted to is contact, having someone that gives me attention and I can be with. No other cam girl or porn causes the same effect on me, and I dont even get ""motivated"" by her in the way one is expected to.

&#x200B;

Basically I want to break from it, move away, but I dont know how. I'm not even sure I even want or can, it scares me and makes me feel really bad, but I know I have to.

I need someway to push or force myself to, something that will cause me less harm to replace her.

&#x200B;

The reason of this post is to ask for help, recomendations or places where I could find help or inform myself on how to move on.",1

2021-07-09 13:59:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/oh10e6/im_unable_to_treat_my_severe_adhd_due_to/,"I'm unable to treat my severe ADHD due to addiction to prescribed stimulants and am frustrated, worried about my future and feeling like a failure","(I had originally posted this to r/ADHD, but it was deleted by the mods and they said to post it on an addiction subreddit)

So, I've been in recovery from a bad addiction to my prescribed stimulant medication for a few months now. I'm proud of myself for that accomplishment, but it also feels very hollow because despite all of my ""progress"" on the recovery front, I'm now left exactly where I was before ever seeking treatment for my ADHD - and to say that that was not a good place is a major understatement. It's like I've finally ascended back up to...zero.

&#x200B;

I'm a visual artist. I discovered my talent for it in middle school and somehow scraped all the way to and through art school and an illustration degree without meds of any sort. It took a lot of unhealthy sleep deprivation, self hate, and unneeded stress and chaos. While I've achieved absolutely nothing since graduating college a few years ago, my old peers are now art professors, professional illustrators, in-house graphic designers. I'm happy for them and proud of their success, of course. But I can't deny that it stings.

Back in school I was the one who missed out on networking events and internship opportunities because just getting the classwork done took everything I had and more, so our respective outcomes aren't at all surprising, but...the difference is still so stark and depressing.

&#x200B;

I've come to the conclusion that my abuse of the meds was, at least in part, a direct result of the deep self esteem issues that come with living with this disorder. What I'm unsure of is how to fix all those issues now that the most effective treatment for ADHD is no longer a viable/healthy option for me.

I'm so jealous of the people on the ADHD subreddit who report changed lives and achieved ambitions after being diagnosed and starting meds - I know that selection bias and the honeymoon phase might be behind some of those posts, but it's still really hard not to hope that if I just try hard enough to moderate my usage and am careful to avoid falling back into a pattern of misusing the meds, I could still be able to make that kind of post in the future. I could still have that kind of life. Everything I've heard/learned in recovery tells me that that's most likely a rationalization that shouldn't be acted on, but...if this is what I've been missing out on due to addiction, it kind of feels like there just...aren't any good options for me? It makes sense that that's realistically the case for some people, right?

I often hear the advice to find a niche talent or skill to make into a career, ""that one thing"" that one always comes back to. That's not sufficient for my case. It's not that I lack direction or passion, it's that I lack the necessary skills to turn that passion into a career - consistent and prompt follow-through, consistent internal motivation, time management skills, etc.

&#x200B;

The worst part is, this is all familiar - I know that for me, unlike for some people, there is no normal/functional brain waiting at the other end of recovery. There's just this never-ending and never-fully-successful tug of war with my own brain to get myself to do anything that I need to do. It's like - if I nap for a few hours before and after and chug absurd amounts of caffeine, I can work on an illustration for maybe 30 minutes to an hour (assuming the stars align and I have the motivation/drive to work on it in the first place, which doesn't happen often enough to be relied on). And that goes for every activity except for scrolling Reddit and watching TV. With meds, none of that struggle and prep was necessary. I just thought of things I needed to do and did them.

I've tried to reframe my thinking around all of this, to learn to value myself as I am. But...the issue is that I genuinely do highly value artistic/creative output (and productivity and accomplishment more generally) outside of the pressures/internalized values of capitalist society. Living like this is really painful and frustrating, and with my track record I'm at an utter loss regarding wtf to do about it. The feeling of underachievement and wasted potential hurts so viscerally it makes me sick to my stomach, and I'm also at a point where my savings are almost gone and I really should get a job ASAP. It makes me feel suicidal at times - I would never actually act on it, but I can't help feeling like realistically I'm not going to get anywhere, so it's hard to muster the enthusiasm necessary to fake it and apply/interview for jobs etc.

&#x200B;

I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here. I guess it would be nice to hear from people who have been diagnosed with ADHD and were/are addicted specifically to the meds they were given to treat it - on r/ADHD I'm pretty sure the general consensus is that that isn't possible if you're ""truly ADHD"" because the meds affect you differently on a biological level, but that wasn't my experience. I think I also need to be talked out of ""giving the meds another try"" - if I wasn't able to control my usage previously, I probably wouldn't be able to this time, and it would erase all the positive progress I *have* made at this point (as intangible and insignificant as it feels).

2021-07-09 13:16:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/oh04sv/how_to_support_my_friend/,How to Support my Friend,"This is in regards to me and my friend who is currently trying to stay sober and for context, we are both women in college. 

My friend has a medical condition and drugs and alcohol irritate her stomach to where she gets flare-ups of her condition and it is life-threatening. Once it resolves, usually with a stay in the hospital, she back to normal until it flares up again. We go to different colleges so we only see each other in the summers and school breaks. She has tried to stay sober before in order to stay out of the hospital but due to her dependency and the people she was around at school she has never been able to sober and then usually ends up back in the hospital and miserable. Recently she had to go to the hospital and was there for about a week and a half, she is now committed to staying sober from weed, alcohol, and coke and is working on phasing out the people in her life that do not support her sobriety. 

I don't drink often but I smoke usually once a day and at night to relax and help me fall asleep. I have also never tried coke. So I am finding it difficult to find the best way to support her and I don't really know what to say to her about this stuff, mostly because I have no experience with it. She came clean to her parents about how she has tried to quit and usually can't and they are pushing her to go to inpatient rehab. I have been encouraging of trying it out because it is summer and she has free time and that it can't hurt to get away to where you can only focus on getting healthy again.  We had a friend in high school that got hooked on pills and she refused to get help and continued to try and suck us down with her, we eventually had to cut her off because she refused help and was becoming quite unstable. My friend is scared that she is going to be her and have her life going nowhere like our old friend is. I have told her that you're nothing like her because you know that you have a problem and want to get better, whereas our old friend refused to acknowledge any issues. 

I want to know if there is anything else I can do to better support her and her journey of sobriety?",1

2021-07-09 10:44:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ogx1ew/need_help_coping_with_brothers_addiction/,Need help coping with brother's addiction,"Hey all, didn't know if this is the right place for it but figured I'd give it a go. Currently my brother is addicted to meth and I'm not sure how to handle it emotionally or how I can support him to get help. I'm only a year older than him but he's someone I've always seen as a confident and strong person. I know he originally started out smoking weed and cigarettes. He moved on to wax and then experimented with harder stuff. In the beginning I would let him know that he's better than that and that he knows that drugs are bad. As his older sister I've always tried to set a good example for him and to let him know that I care. But I'm wondering if I came across as disappointed in him as well? He would always say that he can quit whenever he felt like it and in the beginning I really believed him. Maybe 8 years ago he had a car accident and ended up with a concussion which he refused to get help for. After that his personality completely changed and even at that point didn't realize how big of an issue his drug use was. I figured it was a traumatic brain injury that caused him to snap more often, threaten us, and cause him to get more violent. 

There were a couple times where we had to call 911 because he wouldn't wake up. After they would administer first aid he would refuse to go to the hospital. Police would be parked around our street. We ended up moving from the house we were renting because the police were called so many times due to the traffic from his room (his bedroom had an outer door). Since then we've moved a couple times but I feel like I still blamed him for us having to move in the first place. These are the emotions in feeling. I want him to get help, I'm disappointed in him so much. I'm scared for him, terrified for him, but I feel like a lot of it is his fault. Before all of this we were always close so how do I help him? 

He's been borrowing money from me every few weeks.  Then I found out he's lost his job. Do I keep loaning him money? Would I be contributing to the chance that he'll just use it get drugs if I continue to give it to him? Or would I be pushing him into a corner where he might make another bad or criminal decision if I refuse? He came by a few days ago and flipped out on someone saying that they should look down when speaking to him. Do drugs do this to you? I had talked to him earlier that day because he said his phone had been stolen. I gave him one of my old phones and helped him set it up. He seemed like he knew he needed to cut a lot of the bad people out of his life. I let him know that I believe he could do it. 

Two days ago in the middle of the night he sent our mom a text saying he's sorry. That he's messed up big this time and he can't see any way of coming back from it. That he's sorry to all of us and that we never deserved everything he put us through. That he's going to stay on the other side of the city and see if he can get help. At this point I'm terrified. Why would he push everyone away if he's going to get help? Wouldn't it be better to have us around? Or were we enabling him the entire time by not forcing him to stick with rehab? By letting him handle it because he's a grown man? By giving him money and a place to stay when he had nowhere to go? He's only 30 and it seems so tragic that he's like this now. 

Even if I could go back and have a do-over, would doing the opposite have helped any more than what I did? I feel like I have a lot of regrets but I'm not sure what I should do. I panic thinking that something might happen to him. Terrified that I'll get a call that something had happened. I don't know how to support my mom in this either because I really don't understand addiction so I can't see how this wasn't avoidable. So if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this I would appreciate it.",1

I've got  4 Knoppers knockoffs, 2 Schogotten bars, cuz they were on a discount, and a sweetened condense milk in a tube.

I know sugar is not nearly as severe of a drug as coke or opioids, but guys, it's destroying me.
I've been addicted ever since I can remember.
Maybe it's the fact that candy was never around in the house, allowed only on special occasions, or, as a ""reward""(who the fuck ever thought that was a good idea?!). But it's probably also the fact that my grandparents were giving it to me generously whenever I showed up. And let's not get started on how the evil food industry corporations decided to trash our digestion system in general with the way they sweeaten everything...
All of that has brought me to the point where, I will eat candy until sick whenever I'm either bored, stressed, anxious, need to calm down or need some form of excitement. 
I just can't get off of it no matter how I try. Fruits solve the issue only partially, because they themselves often taste like shit these days, plus they are expensive and you've got 2$ ice-cream right next to them... 

It's horrible.
I hate myself 😭. I hate what it's doing to my body over the years, I know I will end up destroying my liver or getting diabetes in the long run. Yet I can't help it!
I never touched any hard drugs, never even smoked and it's so easy for me to say no to alcohol. But why this???!
The longest I've ever been without sacharose was 6 months, but that was after a serious water fast and 3 months of only fruit diet.
The issue is really complex and another part of the problem is my brain seems to be very unsatisfied with food choices left if I try to rule out the sugar. It's like it misses the diversity and everything else is just bland. Somehow I haven't eaten lentils for more than a year now tho...

The only way for me to not eat that shit is to be super busy all day and eat enough fruits/vegs but that's hardly sustainable as I would probably go crazy from overworking and surely relapse into something even worse...

I have been with a guy (who I will call Tim) for around 5-6 months. We were in discussions about opening the relationship which was always our intention from the start, and wondering the best way to manage this, involving a lot of emotionally charged conversations, since we live in a small island where virtually everyone knows everyone. We decided to stay friends for a little while to decide how we feel and what to do (though he's still being a bit physical with me). Whatever happens, we decided we wanted to stay friends since it's so rare to find deep connections.

Around 6 days ago, Tim decided to try to reduce his cannabis intake (was averaging around 1.5g a day), as well as cut out all hard liquor and go from 15 beers a day to 3. Everyone knows him for how much he drinks (though a very controlled drunk) so people couldn't believe it when he said he was cutting down. While we have been able to have some good moments in the last 6 days, he is of course lashing out and is understandably not in a good way.

When we've tried discussing what to do about us since then, we'll talk, I'll feel confused and get emotional, as I feel so much is contradictory from one day to the next and don't know where I stand. He then he tells me to basically ignore everything he says during withdrawal, and says this is going to go on for years. I have no idea what to do about it - whether I can be supportive and close or if too much for me, as I also have my own issues to heal from. Both of us had been supporting each other and now I'm concerned for his welfare.

I have personally never been an alcoholic (I'm a former cannabis and kratom addict) but my mother was, though a different type of drinker, and I'm trying to understand as best I can. However, Tim is also rather arrogant and closed to hearing about suggestions anyway in life, so instead I'm trying to show trust in that he knows what he's doing. Not easy.

He has a number of mental health issues anyway, and he says he was using drugs (before cannabis and alcohol, a lot of other substances) to repress his narcissistic side which he said is horrible and will make him push everyone away. We are best friends and I'm his only really close friend here who knows about his past and childhood, and we're both very open and comfortable with one another. He has never had anyone to express his feelings to and although he struggles, he's been making progress and people have told me how much ""better"" he's become since we got together.

Unfortunately, he spends all day every day in the local bar (and it's also impossible for me to avoid him due to the nature of where we live). I've tried encouraging him to do other things, but this is his familiar zone and he says it's better to be around people who drink. I had hoped that once he decided to cut down, he would fill his time in other ways, but he's doing the same thing day in day out for months. Last night he got back at 3am, when the bar shuts at 12 and as I walked past this morning, I could see loads of shot glasses on one table so although I don't know if he relapsed, it sent me into quite a bit of anxiety.

When we spoke yesterday, the conversation involved him saying his life was screwed, what was the point in reducing since it messed up all the other areas of his life (he says pushing me away, unable to think clearly so can't earn when he desperately needs an income and is in debt), and that relapse was inevitable and would probably happen multiple times. He said he needed as much stability as possible, which he doesn't have due to his financial situation (we were recently in talks of me helping him to start a business idea he has as says he can't do it alone), and our ongoing relationship dilemma so I said perhaps it's better for me to keep my distance a bit so as to not upset him. He said he didn't want to hurt me, but wasn't happy with forced distance either (especially as it means socialising in the same bar and sitting at different tables). 

I barely drink so my company can help him not drink and smoke as much, and knowing I'm sad makes him want to drink more. Also, when we hang out, we hang often out away from the bar in the evening so again, he's less likely to drink. But he said if distance would help me, then so be it.

I tried asking him to remember the reasons he decided to cut down now (not a great time for him to do so) and he said he had found a lump in his mouth which a family member had had and that had given him a wakeup call. He previously said there were other reasons but he didn't tell me what.

So I don't know what to do. I'm hurting loads - worried he's stopping at the wrong time, or worried it's the right time but wrong strategy, worried of losing my friend, worried he has no support since I'm the only person close to him and everyone else is just an aquaintance, worried about whether to hang out as usual (though emotions likely to be more hurt), or distance as much as possible (hurts and awkward  due to me not being able to avoid him), worried for his health, worried he won't be able to start his business idea without my help...it goes on. I feel lost and alone. I've tried hanging out with some female mates recently but I feel like I'm not really there, except in body.

I know some people might say stay clear and let him get on with it, which is one course of action despite that hurting like hell (he lives 20m from me as well and even if I don't drink at the bar, I have to pass it to get to the one food shop!). I also acknowledge part of my issue is wanting to support people perhaps too much - this probably goes back to my childhood and an ex that was also an alcoholic, plus I used to be therapist.

Does anyone have any words of advice or support?

Thank you",3

2021-07-08 19:11:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ogiuob/question_about_opiate_withdrawal/,Question about Opiate Withdrawal,"I was happily married to my husband for 4 years. One night he woke me up and said he needed help with money because he had a large amount of debit (which I had absolutely no idea about). Upon further questioning he said the debt was because of a pain pill problem he had developed over the last 18 months. He said he had since quit which was why he was now coming to me to ask for help with money (the interest was out of control). After paying off his debt I found out he was still actively using. I gave him MULTIPLE chances to get clean. He is on my insurance and I offered to pay out of pocket for treatment. 

Long story short he kept telling me he was clean but kept testing positive for opiates. I finally told him I could not be with him anymore if he wasnt going to accept my help or admit responsibility.

That was when the physical abuse started. It started with him waving a gun around, then shoving me, then throwing things at me. The worst day was when he strangled and beat me. This occured several times. On one occasion I tried to call 911 but he grabbed me by the hair and took my phone and smashed it.

I could tell his violent episodes only occured within the contexted of him being in withdrawals; he never ever had a violent bone in his body up until this point. I have since left him.

My question is: once an abuser always an abuser? Or is withdrawal so powerful that you would do things your would never dream of doing before? He has since apologized so I struggle with accepting that the violence was a symptom of his disease vs. something he is intrinsically capable of.

Here I fucking am again.

8 years straight smoking 1-3 grams of cannabis daily, taking out loans and getting myself into huge debt, all to feed a fucking shitty, horrible habit. 

I don’t even smoke with friends, non of my friends even smoke, yet this fucking idiot wants to waste all his hard earned money 7 days after pay day. Now i have less than £10 to my name with bank charges to pay soon.

I was doing so well, I had quit smoking both weed and cigarettes for 2 months but something came over me about 6 weeks ago and I’ve fallen right back into to the same shitty pattern I’ve been living for 8 years. I just want to die I feel like such a waste. My dad has been helping me clear off debt which is going well, but the past few months I’m back to spending more than I earn and I have pretty much put my self back to square one again with my finances.

I don’t know what to do with myself. I live alone and the last year has really taken its toll on me, I can’t work out why i am such a huge fuck up. 

I suppose recovery and the road back from addiction is one paved with many many bumps along the way, I just hope that I’ve hit the final bump, because i can’t take another hit",2

Freedom. Yes it’s a lovely idea, but that’s all it is. We aren’t free. Freedom doesn’t exist. It’s a clever trick to make us not question anything. 

I question everything because real freedom is speaking out without being banned and beaten. Freedom is art and love and expression. 

The freedom we have is oppression. Rules. Stipulations. Laws. Break one and well you didn’t have freedom to lose but you did have a choice to choose.

Choices is our freedom. Choices is our voice. But watch what you say because even “freedom” has a price to pay.

I’m a lot of things. I’m a lot of this and that. I’m a little lost and feel exhausted. But I’m rising up slowly never want to move to fast again. I want to start over. It’s jus me and I’m ready to begin.

But at one point i was taking over 120mg of adderall a day, along with other forms of stimulants. Ive delt with an oxy addiction in my past but again thats something ive over come. 
Ive been a functional stoner for the last three years, but just over a year ago i started experimenting with psychedelics. Nothing major at first just tripping on shrooms occasionally. But then my trips became more frequent until i was tripping three or four times a week. But even then i felt like i still had everything under control, it wasnt until a few months ago when i tried mdma for the first time that i realized i was going to have an issue.
Ive never tried anything quite like mdma, and it quickly became my new favorite drug and obsession. It was everything i would want in a drug. The first time i did it i went on a three day bender and was fine afterwards, i told myself i would wait a month and i did, but every time i would do it i would go on a small bender and be fine, i started thinking i was invincible.

After swallowing some pride, came to the realisation that im probably a fuctional addict. 

Little background info; started with partydrugs at raves at 18yo, mostly mdma sometimes combined with speed, within the year speed became more regular in our friend group, every 2 weeks or so. 

For me drugs became some sort of obsession, read everything over al substances i could find, eventualy started taking phenibut, benzo's, these 2 i had fairly under control not taking it more than once a week. At that time also had some weeks were i would use amph in college. Just to write more creative essays and such, worked for a while. But the magic dissapeared fast with daily use. So that became once again a weekend thing Was about 20yo at that time, went on for another year, once a week speed always while heavy drinkin. twice a week benzos or ketamine..  also around this time had a 3 month during daily 2fma habbit 30mg.

When 21 i moved into a house with 3 housemates (who are not really that into drugs) same time my friends started using cocaine, less heavy hangover than the speed habit we had formed. I started using it to, first few months nothing that heavy, once a week at a party, fairly quick became twice a week, but still exept for the price experienced little downsides. 

Until i had some personal issues, started buying more without telling anyone, using al weekend and getting blackout drunk at partys, even started using it in weekdays so i could get the motivation to do the office work. Been doing this for 4 months now but noticed serious chanches in my behavior, ignoring people, arriving late, no interrest in others etc. In other words time to stop, but those plans only stick ttill its friday, 

How do you guys keep the motivation to not use even when youre feeling like shit sober?  Also feel like i cant propperly socialize unless high.. any tips are welcome. Thought about rehab/counceling but rather fix this alone if possible.

Drugs made my everyday monotony and misery temporarily escapable. This is a warning sign for me. I can tell when I start to romanticize past drug use, then I’m not feeling inner-congruence.  When the idea of blacking out and escaping through pills sounds better then trying to further self awareness and self realizations, i can tell I’m thinking In a dark hopeless cloud. Sure, I’ve been sober for about a year now. But I’m still in the depths of hell miserable. I’ve tried. I keep telling myself I have to keep growing, I keep trying to engage in new hobbies. I attempt to read, write raps and better myself. But none of takes away the loneliness. This inner feeling that I’m just going to be empty for the rest of my life. I’m always talking to air. I’m always alone so sometimes I just want to take some Vicodon and not exist. I’m lost right now. This is the most I’ve considered relapse since being sober.

2021-07-07 15:30:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ofq7y5/putting_in_the_hard_work/,Putting in the hard work,"I relapsed about 4 months ago. Prior to the relapse, I had about 7 years clean from my DOC (heroin). This time is different… I only wish I had put in “the hard work” 7 years ago when I got sober the first time, which is why I share this with you all now. 

Here’s the metaphor that I like to use: 7 years ago I dumped some water on the fire that is my addiction. I stopped using drugs and put the fire out, but there were still embers smoldering. I hadn’t addressed all of the behavioral issues that I had developed throughout active addiction. When I say the hard work, I’m referring to the process of undoing all those behavior patterns.

As addicts, we unconsciously do everything that we can to keep the addiction alive. We lie, manipulate, gaslight, steal, and hurt the ones we love most. I can be incredibly selfish without realizing it. I can lie to my wife’s face and not think twice about the emotional abuse. I can be so childish in my needs for attention. We isolate ourselves, because addiction cannot survive in the presence of trusting, open relationships. 

I had gone 7 years without realizing that the “skills” we develop during addiction do not die when we stop using. Seeing this for the first time was like looking at my alter ego… weird and unsettling. 

To all my brothers and sisters out there who are struggling - put in the hard work. Look at the ugly truth. You’ll be amazed to see how your relationships change with the addition of honesty and integrity. Stay strong all you beautiful people… it’s cliche, but this does get way, way better.",9

I have suffered from a gambling addiction for almost 10 years. The last 5 years have been the hardest. I’m 26. I’ve had two turbulent relationships due to my gambling and lack of self-worth. 

I’m currently going through a break-up. We met at the restaurant we had worked at. I was about 60 days clean when we met. I was doing well. We hung out one time, hooked up and have been attached to each other ever since. 

We dated for about a year and a half. I’ve always been extremely insecure and when I wasn’t coping properly with my addiction I would pick fights and tell her some things she was doing were making me uncomfortable. 

There was a guy (her best friend and I was also friends with until we had started dating) that she had hooked up with a couple of times before we started dating. We all worked together. Him and her being around each other made me extremely uncomfortable and eventually, I asked her to block his number and cut off communication. She did. 

Fast forward to our breakup about a year later. We’ve been in contact ever since the day I moved out of the state. She started talking to him again and slept with him two different times. I tried to be completely understanding because she came to me with this information. They are no longer in contact. 

While we were together, she played the rescuer. She always shoved her own problems to the side and never completely opened up to me until things were “over”. She told me she’s always needed attention from guys and had a hard time in high school because of decisions she had made. After she brought the news to me, she decided she was going to start attending SLAA. Me, being an addict, was fully supportive. 

She wasn’t making enough to cover bills after I had left the state, so she called me one day after work and how I would feel if she started stripping? She started. I had to push my insecurities down to cope with this. I view it as counterproductive to her program and things started to boil over. 

We were seriously talking about getting back together. I had almost four months of clean time from gambling, but slipped recently. I told her. I don’t want to blame her for my relapse, but I think I feel that is valid to a degree. 

We have been fighting these past few days and it seems like it’s all solely on me and my relapse. I’m looking for some support and advice. I feel I’ve been bending over backwards with my support and understanding. 

Thank you. (I wish I had a different username 😂)",6

Questions.,"I’m a 28/F who has been using alcohol since early teen years. This multiplied during COVID, where is seemed to become the norm to drink in your apartment every day. I have been drinking wine every evening for months. I can’t even begin to tell you how significantly this impaired my mental health (I have been depressed for years as is). I deal with a lot of suicidal ideation, loss of identity/purpose, and the most crippling anxiety when I come up off alcohol. I wouldn’t eat for days, drink on an empty stomach, repeat. Rendering myself numb temporarily seemed to outweigh the fact that I was causing a lot of mental instability and physical pain. 

My dentist made a comment about some mild erosion of my enamel, usually caused by vomiting too much. Denied. My hair dresser commented how it was strange that only certain part of my hair was dead at the end, I made up some excuse because I couldn’t say, “Yeah, I yanked it out when I was drunk.”

Luckily this issue never leaked over into my career but I could see it coming. I quit cold turkey a week ago.

It all started when I got a sub to one of my favorite streamers. I decided to treat myself by subbing to them for my birthday last year because I thought that one couldn't hurt. Then as time went on, I got another. So then I thought that 2 wasn't that much then it became 3 and then 4. Then my tax refund came in back in February and I gifted 7 subs so a streamer could reach a sub goal for a community night. So I thought that would be the last of it, but I just kept buying subs and bits like every day it was like $2 here and $5 there. It reached a head when I spent nearly $80 and the bank got into my overdraft. Had to get the card changed to try and stop. 2 weeks after I got that changed, I relapsed and ended up getting more. Over the past 6 months, I have spent about $500 and I want to stop. Hope that this explains things. I want to get help for this because it has taken a hold on me and my bank account",1

After that, I slowly started to use but only because I felt like enjoying in social settings - not because I felt like I needed it to feel better/not sad. Today I got hit hard with 2 sad/bitter situations - personal and professional. I had planned on inviting my coworkers to drinks before those events happened. For the first time in a while I kinda felt like I was desperate to have a drinking buddy so I could just drink to feel better. One went home and the other is a former alcoholic. I was so tempted to just ask them to get drinks but I knew if I did, I’d just get trashed in front of them, which would not be nice because it could encourage them and/or they’d have to deal with my chaos. 

So I walked home and smoked the entire way home until my sadness felt numb. I consider today another relapse; because I smoked to make myself not sad and I smoked because I didn’t want to drink alone or drag someone else down. I could really use some positive words.",6

In my case, freedom is both a choice and a constant battle. I guess you could say that's true for many instances of freedom, they're earned - but mine has no finish line. I will never cross a threshold and be rid of the poison that travels.my veins. 

Addiction never really goes *away*, I will never truly be free. 

But it does get easier as time erodes the obsession and cravings to use. And as that had happened I've been able to take on a new perception of myself, and the life I lead. 

 I fought like hell for this half-assed version of freedom, and I'm finally in a place where I'm in control, and that's a massive victory. It's like I can let my guard down a little bit, but never too much. If and when I have thoughts of using I know how to combat them. I know how to disarm my mind and rationalize the reasons why I shouldn't crush up that line....

Eesh. 

Just writing that makes.me miss it. *That's my truth.*

And I'm proud of myself for recognizing that, and moving on. It's been almost a year and 2 weeks of sobriety, and I've learned a great deal about myself and about the process of letting go. There's many cycles, and it isn't easy to see everything for what it is when you're immersed in it - such as many things. But I've come to a point of clarity, likely because it's a significant milestone and I have been doing a lot of reflecting on my (long) time as a user, and my time sober from opiates. 

And I'd like to share some things I've learned when reflecting on my first 6 months of being sober. 

- Simply quitting or abstaining from using my drugs of choice fixed almost nothing, except my bank account. Nothing ""changed"" until I began recovery, started asking for help, and acknowledged that I had a lot of work to do on myself, and that the **problem wasn't using, really. The problem was the fact that it was my coping mechanism, my way out of dealing with life, and the only way I knew how to feel happiness.**


- There are a lot of miserable days. Tears. Shame. Guilt. Fear. And in the beginning it was really tough for me to make sense of where any of it was coming from. Everyone kept telling me how great I was doing, how I should be proud, and it made me feel like I was broken because I felt none of that. 

- I also learned life is not unbearable without prescription opiates. Some days it felt like that still, but most were okay

- I started remembering who I was before the drugs gave me a different identity. 

- I began to truly experience my emotions again

- Acknowledging, owning, and ultimately accepting responsibility for my behaviors, choices, actions and words when I was an active user was crucial to moving forward. 

- I transitioned from a completely self-centered state of mind to being aware and sensitive to the needs and emotions of others. I am still practicing this, it has been challenging for me to step outside my own perception and hear/see things in the way someone else does. 

- I missed the relationship I had with opiates. Someone here compared the beginning stages of sobriety to losing someone you care for deeply. It felt exactly like that, I would describe myself as feeling lost and alone for the first few months. 

- Holidays were really tough for me, along with other things. I began learning what my triggers were and doing what I could to prepare. 

- Staying sober was my main priority in life during those first 6 months

And in closing, something I've learned more recently is that I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life, and after using for almost my whole adult life (in one capacity or another) I can safely say that that is no coincidence.

In my total 22 years of life I end up gambling anytime I see a paycheque. It’s really pathetic and saddening, especially this time: I just completed addiction treatment at a professional facility 1 week ago. My life is falling back into place and I have nice things again, yet I still just lost $400 I could not afford to lose...I see maybe $900 every 2 weeks. It’s a sickening feeling to lose that money because it could very well be put into important things or savings..this is now another obstacle I set in my road of recovery I hope I don’t dwell this loss too harshly because I’ve been doing really well for myself :/ I don’t wanna tell anybody in my life this just happened so I’m going to pretend this did not happen.

For some reason our year started off really horrible including the loss of someone very important to us back in February which sent me into a spiral of just giving up. So in only 7 months time we’ve developed an addiction, suffered the consequences and have truly came to that point of hating drugs and just being tired of it all. I have an appointment Thursday to see a doctor for Suboxone but we’re still having to use at least once a day. We’ve had to go through withdrawals so frequently lately that it isn’t even that bad anymore. But now things have become so out of whack for us that we’re both just depressed every single day. I know it’s gonna take some time before we’re back on top again but I’m so exhausted all the time and I spend every moment hating my situation. I know it could be much worse. I could be homeless and jobless with no one left willing to help me. We’re actually in a better spot than most people who have been through this, I guess I’m just feeling down.",1

Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't."" - Lewis Carroll","I must have heard Zizek slip this joke into a dozen different public appearances to describe what Hegel called *Determinate Negation*: A man orders a coffee without cream and the barista says ""I'm sorry, we don't have cream here, can I give you a coffee without milk?"" 

It's kind of a dumb joke and I think a much better example of the point is a boys/girls club. Is a boy's club defined by the presence of boys? If so then every classroom I've ever been in is a boys club. But of course a boy's club is defined by the *absence* of girls. The definition of the thing is in what's missing; It is what it's not. 

Herein lies the problem with the discourse surrounding addiction as a disease. The word disease implies a *presence*, as in a pathogen or disorder. But even a cursory look at addicts and their lives, especially their successes and failures in recovery, will show addiction is an abscess, a void, an abyss that stares back at you, which you can fill with your choice of chemicals supplied by modernity, the same modernity that created the void by keeping you from living like a human, making you live like a machine. This is why it's neither useful nor accurate to call addiction a disease.

I feel so lost and so alone in this being so young and seeing everyone go out all the time. I tell myself that I’m doing the right thing by staying sober but it feels so lonely. 

I realized I had to get sober 3 weeks ago when I was admitted into the hospital after passing out unconscious for 12 hours and slamming my head through a mirror after a long night binging alcohol, coke, heroin, and meth. I woke up in severe kidney and liver failure and was told if I came in a few hours later I would have been dead. I’m so embarrassed by my actions and embarrassed to talk about it. I’m now on dialysis with only a 50% chance of recovering kidney function. 

I don’t know how to live this way. I moved back in with my parents and they say “just don’t drink”. I feel like no one my age or around me understands addiction or how lonely it is. I don’t see my friends because they all talk about their jobs, kids, and amazing vacations. What do I say back to them? Like all I’ve done for the last 10 years is get so fucked up and made a fool of myself. When my friends reminisce on the past with me it’s always a story about me pissing myself, passing out with a random guy, doing a walk of shame, or getting kicked out of a bar.

My process usually goes -- have a drink or two, nothing can go wrong. Then I have about 4-5 drinks, next thing is I find an excuse to call my dealer, or I start contacting mates I know to get on it hoping that it might spark something to happen. Once I get high, I get the instant urge to gamble and that's when I keep going until I've drained my account completely or all venues are closed. I continue onto the next day if I've got drugs left, and money left. This usually continues until I lose everything or win big.

I've been doing good with the gambling urges, I don't think I've had any but I've been having a lot of urges to drink and get on the coke. 

I'm on day 10 at the moment and I'm starting to feel better after my last relapse and seeing a path out of my immediate debts which is a problem for me because that's when I start using money to go out and fuel my addictions. This has been my process for 11 years and I've spent well over $500k on it. 

I'm going to GA daily and have a good support group and I'm definitely not doing anything today but I'm worried one day soon the urges are going to take over. I'm seeing a therapist about this as well and I'm just hoping that I can find some answers that will help fight the urges really soon because I don't think I have any more pain tolerance left for another attempt at recovery. My last relapse lead to me calling the suicide hotline and entering recovery as it is now. 

If anyone has any tips or advice that would be greatly appreciated, I mainly wanted to write my thoughts out. Today I'm feeling good and I know I won't do anything, I'm just worried about what the future will bring.

Wishing everyone the best in their recovery, addiction is rough.",3

Does anyone have any recommendations for a phone surrounding these details:

1. Area: Australia
2. Wanted features: Call and text, GPS/ maps, notes, relatively fast texting ability, voice recorder, camera with no option to edit photos (internet access ideal but only without social media access and restrictions to parental blocks for things like porn and youtube), (apps access ideal but only if restricted to not download things that would lead to distraction)
3. Unwanted features: Social media (including reddit), Youtube, games, anything that might lead to distractions, photo editing software, music software or apps
4. Price: As cheap as possible
5. Extras: Flip phone would be pretty cool

So me and this guy are seeing each other. He is addicted to a drug I used to be addicted to. I 100000% have zero interest in this drug anymore. However I do drink heavily. I'm not sure if that's important than I thought I'd mention.

When he can spend enough time with me he can stay sober. The problem is I don't have time to baby-sit him to be sober. I have a kid and he can only come over after she's gone to sleep because I don't trust him to stay so. That's actually not true I don't want her to meet him if he won't be here six months from now even though we've been talking for almost a year. But more seriously over the last 6 months. I'm not sure if he uses the fact that he wants to be sober or to keep me hanging on but I wouldn't be surprised by that. Having done that myself in the past.

Nine times out of ten he will only come over if he's sober but obviously he's a frequent user at this point. And I guess by so where I mean he hasn't used that day he sees me.

Not to make excuses but he is a veteran who served in the Infantry a few times. And I know but he's struggling. But how do I do this with him. Or should I just tell him I can't? I was with someone who helped me get sober because they cared enough but there was not a kid on my end at that point. And that person was able to provide me a lot of support.

Im 38 years old and I am at my lowest point ever. My lowest is incomparable to most I'm sure but its still true. I started drinking daily around 22 years old. At the same time I also met my exwife and started that relationship. The drinking was of course really bad for my marriage and my life in general. We had 2 kids and for most of the first 10 years of my marriage I was a shitty husband and provider. I wasnt abusive physical or otherwise, outside of the yelling matches with the wife. And even tho I was a bad provider I was good to my kids..(as much as u xan b)...I couldn't hold a job so I was always home with them. This went on for 10 years roughly until one day in October of 15 I decided I didn't wanna drink anymore. Im not really sure to this day what triggered it but I felt like shit and said to myself im not gonna get a bottle tonight, ill just smoke some bud and get some rest. It had been so long since I'd woken up w/o a hangover I'd forgotten what it felt like. So I just kept doing that. Within a month I had gotten a job at the Dollar General in my town stocking shelves and by March of 16 I was the Assistant Manager and my boss the store manager planned to leave by July. That same year a law that Obama passed was to go into effect. Salaried workers must make at least 47k a year or b paid overtime. I had no desire to take her job at 31k a year salary working 60 hour weeks, but 47k I was willing and ready. So with her recommendation I take over the store in July. The law is set to pass at the end of the year. Life is going yhe best it ever had at that point. Wife and I were getting along great. November comes around and corporate has conference calls with all the store managers about how essential we are to the stores so to make sure we don't qualify for OT were all going up to 47k a year, like I said this was a 16k raise with I know salaries are relative but this fuxkjng felt like changing. I was working minimum 60 hour weeks for a salary check of around 500 but this was gonna make it all worth it Well before Thanksgiving break Congress feeling very Conservative after the election blocked the law...this broke me...but I didn't start drinking...I started doing meth...within a year id lost my job and in 2019 my wife left me for someone else..I moved in with my grandmother and here I now sit 2 years later as I type this out...I just ever really talk to 2 peoe who are good peolme but they are meth addicts as well...im incredibly isolated and sad all the time...ibr started talking outloud to myself when I'm alone and its always calling myself a loser or. PoS..I want to be done with this...Im fucking lonely...i can't think about anything except drugs or existential bullshit...I want to find a job that won't make me miserable but my only experience is retail and they fuxked me..I dont wanna be alone anymore...I wanna meet a woman whose interesting and funny and have a best friend again like I had that brief period of my marriage...my kids are 16 and 17 now, I want to see my grandkids which are coming in the next decade..I want to get a place so they can some stay with me now when they want...I want to be fucking happy...and I know I can fucking do it...I know I have yhe willpower to fucking do it...I just need to find it...I dont want to go into any kind of rehab unless I just absolutely can't do it...ive never truly tried tho...but yhe last time I used was yesterday so if I can just do it again tomorrow  , just like I did with whiskey years ago I know it'll change my life.

Kratom has helped me IMMENSELY throughout this. I get really low, a lot and I try to convince myself I don’t need to take the Perc 30s that I have access to. But it’s literally all I crave. And I don’t have a single person I can go to about this for support. It makes it all feel rather pointless.

Last week I decided I was going to make some dating accounts and try to at least meet people. Thursday night I stepped out of my confront zone and met a new friend and learned some salsa dancing. None of it helped my anxiety but I was proud of myself for doing it. Yesterday I met another new friend but also had different, unrelated bad news dropped on me later in the evening. I had dreams about my ex last night and woke up with bad anxiety today. 

Today I have just been emotionally drained. I’m exhausted. I’m depressed. I’m unmotivated. And I think I overloaded my social bar with too many new people too soon. The one person I want to see more than anything is entirely unconcerned about me and I’m not dealing with it too wonderfully. For reference, he has me blocked on everything and no, I’m not trying to reach out or make accounts to see his life. I’m truly trying to move on and it’s been rough.

I have had the strongest cravings ever today. Nothing sounds better than feeling a surge of warm happiness rushing through my body followed by a long walk. I reached out to one of my few plugs. Asked him for the percs. After keeping me on my toes for a bit, he tells me he can’t get anyone. Now, I know for a fact the percs are prescription. They’re not pressed. I’ve never fucked with anything that isn’t legitimate (as far as I know).
My plug then kindly informs me he has fentanyl caps. 

He knows I don’t fuck with that shit because there’s no sure dosage, and I have no clue what I’m really taking. He assures me they’re “so good” and I would be fine with a half cap. He tells me that they’re just like the 30s that I love so much. My addict brain lit up with the sounds of that. I was more than willing to give it a try. I am, after all, not really in the greatest headspace at this moment so these pills sure do sound appealing. 

I was getting ready to head over when I felt what I can only describe as a fist sitting in my stomach. I stopped and took a moment to critically think about my decision to grab this strange, street drug that causes hundred overdoses and questioned if I really wanted to try it. I did.

But then I began I search more into Reddit with people’s personal experiences. I read how common/easy fent related overdoses are. I read most people saying it was “okay” and how a perc 30 was better for the duration of the high. Reddit talked me out of it, and then my gut helped sum up my conclusion that it was a bad, dumb idea. 

Just wanted to share.",6

I've already seen where addiction could take you from relatives and friends going down the same path but it doesn't bother me at all I've always felt I'd end up that way and I've always just accepted it. I see people saying to get sober or how you'd be so much better off if you were sober but Everytime I've tried to stay sober for more than a day or two life is just dull I find no interest in anything all I can think about when I'm not high is how and when I can get high.

2021-07-03 12:33:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/od1eij/update_on_progress/,Update on Progress,"I was just looking through old Reddit accounts I had and I stumbled across this one.  I made a post about being an addict, overweight living in my brothers basement.  That was 3 year ago.  A few months after that post I got clean, on suboxone maintenance and started working again.  It was hard, I worked shitty jobs for shitty money until I finally found my niche, sales.  I started working for a great company and started making a decent living, got really into fitness and eating right and changed my life.

I've stayed clean since August 2018, I also changed my diet and have lost so far 190 from my heaviest.  I applied the same determination to getting high to getting well.  I met a wonderful woman who I have been together with for almost 9 months at this point.  We moved in together and got an apartment in one of the nicest areas in my city.  If you told me all of this was in my future 3 years ago when I made that post, I would say you were full of shit, but here I am sitting on my computer in my first apartment that is mine, no roommate.  

Don't stop fighting, keep pushing, if I can do it you can do it and if being on a maintenance medication helps you, do it.  Suboxone helped keep me from relapsing due to the blocking effect, its harder to make a bad decision constantly for 1-2 days while it wears off.

I thoroughly enjoy life now, you need to find your purpose, what you want to do and other things that will fulfill you.

I am still working on putting together my mental outlook and psychological health, but I am getting there.  Just know, when you get sober it will take a while for things to turn around, but they will.

I started using DMH on and off from september 2020 and was using it everyday from Feb. I also have a past experience with ice from March 2020 - April 2021. I managed to give it up myself and still experience the fucked up dreams to this day. Anyways, i have been having problems with my memory and attention since I stopped DXM. It's starting to really worry me as this has never happened to me. I struggle to remember the most simple things and oftenly forget memories from the past, cant even remember what I did for my past few birthdays. I've also developed an all the time anxiety , before drug use (even after stopping meth) I never experinced anxiety like I do now where it's actually stopping me from doing things. I still get on and off depression with struggling to keep focus on simple tasks. 

I don't know what the go is, I don't crave DXM all the time anymore and I don't get the messed up robo dreams either. If anyone has any advice please let me know below!",3

2021-07-02 13:52:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ocfd9u/addiction_wars/,Addiction Wars,"This is a bit of a read, but I promise the end is worth it. Downvote if you disagree so others don't waste their time and I can edit.

**Historical Trend**

* In the 1600's the Dutch distilled gin and spread it throughout Europe. ""The Dutch economy achieve the highest standard of living in Europe (and probably the world) by the middle of the 17th century."" (Wikipedia)
* Britain got China addicted to opium and maintained the addiction by winning both Opium Wars, which crushed the Chinese economy from the 1840's to the 1950's.  ""East India Company merchants balanced an economic deficit from the importation of [Chinese tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_tea) by selling Indian opium which was smuggled into China in defiance of [Qing government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty) bans."" (Wikipedia) Britain's economy skyrocketed while China's economy plummeted. There are other factors at play alongside this, but for the sake of the argument, stick with me.
* In the early 1900's throughout the World Wars, the US intentionally pushed cigarettes around the world. (Wikipedia) Not that this was the only reason the US economy grew after the wars, but it certainly helped.

**Modern Addictions**

* US discovers the addictive nature of sugar and high fructose corn syrup and spreads it around the world.
* Social media spread from the US around the developed world in the 2010's. Today, Facebook and YouTube each claim well over two billion users. (Wikipedia)
* Video games, especially eSports have an incredibly addictive nature for the players. The US started the production and spread of these, but China has since taken the lead. China, the US, and Japan are leading the world in revenue generated by video games, and there are now over a billion ""users"" worldwide. (Wikipedia)

**The Point**

People are fragile psychological beings. (I'm a psychology major, work with kids, and have my own addictions) Addiction is treated as a personal character flaw. Based on current and historical numbers though, it is a thing to be exploited by markets. People will spend obscene amounts of money to fuel their addictions, whether it be alcohol, drugs, sugar, social media, video games, or some other thing they are hooked on. It is entirely plausible that countries with competing economic interests have noticed this. Which ever country produces the world's next addiction stands to gain an enormous amount of wealth. They also stand to exploit the fragile psychology of their rival nation's citizens and suck wealth out through the addictions. Isn't it interesting that China keeps all US technology out of the country. Isn't it interesting that the Trump administration's knee-jerk reaction to TikTok was to spread fear about the app to slow its spread? It's almost like each country realizes that addiction-production is a weapon to be used against each other's economies. Unfortunately, other nations either haven't realized this yet, or don't have tight enough control over their populations to prevent their own economic decline. Developed countries that are not active producers of addictions are collateral damage in this addiction war between the top countries. The US and China will slowly drain the wealth out of the rest of the world by taxing the addictive nature of people who don't realize they are being used as a weapon against their own economy.

When he wasn’t using, and when he originally got sober years ago, he told me he gained a lot of weight (replaced the pills with food) and the past two years he’s been working out daily and I think he looks great. However, he also doesn’t really eat that much...and he’s working out daily. I feel like I eat more than him. He told me his stomach shrank from when he was bigger and eating more.

Life keeps hitting us with blow after blow and the stress is crushing me, and I am struggling hard to not cave. I mostly just needed to vent, but any advice is more than welcome. Thank you.",6

2021-07-01 09:45:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/obm5wh/need_help_with_meth/,Need help with Meth,"Hi everyone,

Just a backgrounder.

I first experienced Meth when I was 18.

I never did it again till I was in my mid 20s and that too only once.

Then in my mid 30s, I did it it again and this time I did it a couple of times per year (4-5 times with a binge lasting about 2-3 days).

Then recently like 2 years ago, I started developing cravings for it. I will have dreams about it, I can taste it, and I will lie my way out of things just so I can have a session.

Now it is getting serious and I am scared.

I have a beautiful 10 month old son, my wife is perfect, my family is perfect, and I have built a successful business. 

I have lots to lose now. I recently hit a wall after 4 months clean.

The longest I have gone without it recently is 4 months. I cant seem to get past that timeline. 

I lie to my family and friends which I do not like because I am not like that. 

I do smoke weed too which I am prepared to let go. I dont smoke cigarettes but I do enjoy a drink.

I am prepared to do whatever it takes.

I have not seeked rehab because I cant be away for so long from my business and family. 

I do understand that if i do not make that sacrifice now, there may not be anything left for me in the future.

My question is, is there any other way? 

I live in a south east asian country where the stigma against such things is bad and there is not much help.

I am also afraid that if I turn to rehab, the record may stay with me and affect my future career choices. 

Help please. What choices do I have? 

I need it out of me. It is almost like I am possessed.",5

2021-07-01 05:00:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/obhrj3/identity_in_addiction_and_abstinence/,Identity in addiction and abstinence,"Hi! I was thinking about how addiction becomes the part of your identity and that's a factor, which makes beating the addiction harder. Also, if you are a recovering addict and sober for a while now, for lot of people soberness is an identity forming element too. That's why they're so dissapointed in themselvs if they relapse. Being absolutely sober is much easier than taking drugs responsibly, especially if you were an addict before. My point is that don't hate on those people who don't want to identify themselves as either groups. Don't hate the substance, drugs are not good or bad, it's what people make out of it. Stay safe, be responsible!",3

2021-07-01 02:17:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/obfpk0/addiction_grief_existential_dread/,"addiction, grief, existential dread","hey everyone. i’m not sure who to talk to right now. i have a lot of shame around my substance use and feel that when i talk to my close friends they just get scared and don’t know what to say because they can’t understand what i’m going through.

a couple years ago, i lost my mom and my sister 103 days apart from one another. before that i had never done anything harder than mushrooms. i drank a bit, as i was a bartender for a long time, but i was genuinely afraid of harder drugs. after they died i started to experiment with DMT as an attempt to understand death and the after life. i didn’t abuse it, but it piqued my interest and i started using psychedelics more, especially ketamine.

the ketamine use started out casual as the pandemic flew in to full force, and i was seeing a girl who was pretty in to coke so we started using both pretty regularly. and that escalated to daily use. we’ve since split up, but that hasn’t slowed my use.  

my plug has become a close friend so the access is no hurdle. i can get shit on front, deal a little to get shit for free, do his. but i’m sure my addiction for it wouldn’t stop me even if it wasn’t “that easy.

but my depression and grief is still so present. and even though i know using drugs this often can only fuck me up in the long run, it’s hard to fight the urge to not escape from this fucked up world.

i’m not saying my life is so tragic. i am, by all intents and purposes, privileged. but i’m also black, gay, queer, depressed, and the world is bleak. i wish i was dumber. i’m in therapy, i have friends, a job. but jesus christ… every day is a constant fight.",5

I wish I had never picked up in the first place, yet I did it anyway knowing DAMN well that it would lead to addiction. Now I can't get myself to stop relapsing. 

Every single time I use this shit I end up coming down so bad that I want to die. Yet... I keep using. 

Anyway, I wouldn't wish this upon anyone, not even people I dislike. 

Why am I like this? (rhetorical)",6
