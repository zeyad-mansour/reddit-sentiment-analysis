My longest streak was 13 days, and I relapsed for about two weeks. I’m now even more determined to stay clean, and this time for myself. 

I’m writing this for anyone who’s also wanting to quit this drug. I’ve found a combination of 3 supplements that absolutely have changed the entire game for me. I felt absolutely amazing after trying these three in combination yesterday. So I wanted to share them with you as well, to try. 

1) 5-HTP: 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) is an amino acid that your body naturally produces. Your body uses it to produce serotonin, a chemical messenger that sends signals between your nerve cells. Low serotonin levels are associated with depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, weight gain and other health problems. 

2) GABA: Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a naturally occurring amino acid that works as a neurotransmitter in your brain. Neurotransmitters function as chemical messengers. GABA is considered an inhibitory neurotransmitter because it blocks, or inhibits, certain brain signals and decreases activity in your nervous system. **Works Wonders for anxiety** 

3) Kratom: **Specifically I recommend a white vein.** People use kratom for withdrawal from heroin, morphine, and other opioid drugs, as well as cough, depression, anxiety, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.

• Personally I use White Maeng DA capsules, and it gave me the energy to actually clean the house yesterday. (ON DAY 6 OF WITHDRAWAL!!) My mind was blown!! 

• Word of caution: Do not take daily for a prolonged period of time!! Withdrawal symptoms are similar to that of opiate withdrawal! Personally I’m considering like a two to three day on, then take one to three days off.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9913474917411804}"

I went off the rails at the end of last year, and a dear group of friends stepped in for a heart wrenching (and admittedly very well done) intervention a few week ago.

I'm 3 weeks into this program called ""Ready 2 Change"": [https://www.directline.org.au/ready-2-change](https://www.directline.org.au/ready-2-change)

I was told of them when I spoke to an online counsellor here: [https://www.counsellingonline.org.au/](https://www.counsellingonline.org.au/)

I didn't like AA at all. I've responded well to SMART meetings in the past but I've been unable to attend meetings in person, the online ones weren't really cutting it. R2C have online modules to work through that echo the SMART Cognitive Behavioural Therapy approach. I'm really appreciating the one on one attention and my counsellor is wonderful. It's confronting as fuck, but it's helping remarkably with how overwhelming everything felt a few weeks ago. 

Hope this recommendation might be able to do something good for you, or at least help you find something similar in your area if it's your jam.

But I need to start being honest with myself so I figure this is the best place. 

I’ve been told to just moderate my time but I can’t. I come home from work and instead of being productive like furthering my career or aspirations I just sit and play videos games until 2 or 3 only to wake up 5 hours later. I do this almost everyday. I feel like I’m at the point where I can’t go to bed without playing. I tell myself I’ll only play a few games but it never turns into that. I’m starting to realize that these are normal symptoms of addiction. The worst part is I sold my gaming system 6 months ago and things were great. My relationships, work ethic, job life. 
I just saw it one day and thought “maybe I’m better now. I won’t go overboard again” so I bought another one. And now it has gotten back to the point. 

I consider myself a pretty antisocial person I really enjoy playing video games. They have been a big part of my life and have got me through tough times. Something about encompassing myself into a virtual world and just being “away from life” is something that I enjoy very much. But I know it’s really bad. I know I should just sell it again and keep it out of my life. I dont know what’s stopping me. Maybe I just need reinforcement. I’m 23 with a lot of career aspirations and goals.

2020-01-30 06:35:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ew42i2/consuming_caffeine_increases_the_probability_of_a/,Consuming caffeine increases the probability of a relapse by enhancing cravings.,"I just found out, [in this article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324768.php#mood), that *a 2015 study showed that caffeine does not directly stimulate dopamine production. Instead, it increases the number of available dopamine receptors in the brain. This may enhance dopamine's overall effect on the brain*.  

By having more dopamine receptors available you are more susceptible to cravings because you experience them more intensely. I've started and quit coffee 10 times now over the years. There was a pattern where I would ""fall off the wagon"" (relapse) during the periods in my life where I was drinking coffee but I didn't have the data to confirm this.

Also, do want to hurt myself and want to quit before I'm forced to quit from physical stuff or something. Just wondering... What can I expect when I quit?

I want to talk about that sober period.

Doing things, activities, for the sake of doing them, was brand new to me. Choosing the people around me kept life interesting. Boredom is always a challenge, but life has to be good enough on its own.

That's the difference to people who haven't been addicted... Yet. They enjoy life. Don't forget that the trap is there for all. Who knows what will trigger someone into addiction for the first time. 

Is life easy to choose? Nope. Not if you've never done it, or practiced it. Even if you have. 

I remember that I wasn't miserable, I didn't show up to meetings like a wild man. I just didn't put the poison in my one and only body. Sobriety was obvious. 

Fast forward to today. Big problems, because I forgot to keep the sub conscious sharp and practiced. But it's malleable. After a while, I won't be addicted. I'm very frustrated now, but sharing this helps.

**Jan 25 2020 – Day 13** 

There are two dogs fighting inside you, ferociously. Who wins? The one you feed, they say... 

Two voices argue in a heated debate inside your head – I know which one is right, but why is the other so loud? ""Shut up!"" The first voice howls.

The second voice barks back “But, come on, why not? Seriously, its just once, what harm can be done you need it, hell you deserve it! You've being doing so GOOD. It's not going to kill you, or hurt you, no one will know but us.  We can hid it and lie like we've always done. Imagine how GOOD it will feel, you've been off it so long now it'll be like your first time again. mmmmmmhm. I can feel it now""

""I said, SHUT UP!"" the first voice rebuttals. And so the back and forth goes:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

\- ""Why not, it's just once. You don't even have to go back to day 0 just tell everyone you're still trucking""

&#x200B;

\- “Because It’s never once, is it? And if not this time, then when? When is enough... enough? Are you simply a slave to your desires? Have you submitted and given in to slavery instead of freedom? We all have desires you know – normal people are happy too because they *work for it. They earn it*. Go earn your own happiness. Your here for a reason. You can find it. You can find your reason. It’s ok to not know … to be uncertain of the future. 

&#x200B;

\- “But you’re bored. And that sounds hard. Sounds like that take way too much work. You feel lazy and tired and useless. I mean you have no fun now, nothing to look forward to! Fuck this right? And it’s going to take a while to do it THAT way anyway, and in the meantime you know… just for the weekend. You feel pain and You know we could fix this. If we just….”

&#x200B;

\- ""SHUT. UPPPPP!  

There’s only one way to fix this, you already know the answer. At a crossroad, like a fork in the road, left vs right ya know like the whole Robert Frost thing. You’ve taken left so many times, hitting your head, getting beat to a raw, bare nub each and every time. You want that again? To circle back again? That’s like handing yourself and lollipop to stand and line to get your nuts kicked in and going to back to get another. Fuck that. Why not just TRY the right way. Why not just give it a chance and see. You’ve never even given the right way the chance it deserves, the chance YOU deserve. You’ve already given the left so many chances and so many times have you came back empty, with tears in your eyes and pain in your heart asking, no PLEADING, to be saved – the life raft has been thrown at you - will you take it?”

&#x200B;

\- “Yeah okay. Whatever, we can do that. We can definitely do that lets just ease this pain one more time, ease this boredom just this weekend and on Monday we’ll be back on track. And if you don’t give in to the devilish pills, why now just a little something else to take the edge off huh? Why not some alcohol – some weed. Something to kick this feeling”

&#x200B;

\- “Because its not right. I know its not. I want my brain to heal and it can’t do that if I keep altering it. You know that.”

&#x200B;

\- “Than why am I still in your head telling you this? I am you, too, you know?”

&#x200B;

\- “Nah. You’re not me. You’re just my thoughts. Grand, delusional, deceiving, lying, stealing, cheating thoughts. Look what you’ve done to me.

&#x200B;

\- “You did this to yourself”

&#x200B;

\_ “And I’m doing THIS NOW, for myself. I’m fighting back, not giving in. Fuck Slavery, I want to taste freedom. I’m giving myself a chance”

&#x200B;

\- “You’ll be back”

\- “Maybe, but not today. 

\- “You think you can last?”

\- “I can’t. Not alone.”

\- “Woooooo!”

\- “Shut up. I have a plan” 

\- “A plan to use again?”

&#x200B;

\- “It’s not my plan it’s God’s plan. He has a plan for me and its not that life man. Not anymore. I know he has so much more in store for me in this life and the next... drugs USED to be my life and it USED to be good and fun and manageable even. For years we used and enjoyed it and had fun and got away from it. It was good. It’s not that anymore. It’s just not. Somewhere down the line...things just changed, it turned and flipped everything upside down. I have the same memories, the euphoria and content and escape it used to bring.  I understand why you have those thoughts and want to go back but they’re self-sabotaging you. Imagine your life 3 months from now, clean, in shape, with money and a life and a future… a girlfriend and family that love and trust you. Imagine your life a year from now. You can’t use forever, but you can start your life today. A life worth living, not a life you have to alter your mind everyday to enjoy. True happiness does exist. It’s real”

\- “You’ve never been happy before, why this time?”

\- “I can be transformed. We all can. I’ve given my life to Jesus who has promised to transform me, completely. Mentally, spiritually and physically we can change. Maybe life isn't just about feeling good and being happy, maybe there is more. I can change. I can be different. I can be born again, I can be a new person. I can have hobbies that I love, friends that I love, ideas that don’t come from the Devil but from that Lord. God exist, he’s real ya know? You fucking know that. Come on, let’s give him a chance to fulfil his promise to us.”

\- “…you're getting louder, arn't you?""

\- “I am. But I’m just being fed. I get louder and louder with each and every heaping spoonful of my recovery and I’m being trained to think new again. I’m louder now. I can be louder than you. You will still talk but I will always have the last word and when I’m weak, I’ll call my support. I’ll fight for us. **I know you only want us to feel good**. I’ll help us feel good LONG TERM. Suffer today and live the rest of your life in triumph knowing you beat the devil himself and he had his claws buried inside you. We can take the pill and smoke the weed and drink and pop adderals and that be fun, for a little, but The high will NEVER last mate. Your problems will still be there when your sober mind is back. SO will The regret, shame and guilt … those things too.""

""Whatever. You can barely hear me. Talk later""

\- "" I’m not perfect and you will be back, loud again and be convincing and witty and cunning and convince me “just today we can use” and I’ll be weak and let the thought breathe for a moment – but When I’m weak, I’ll pray. When I’m hurt, I’ll cry, when I’m bored, I’ll be bored when I’m lazy I’ll build my work ethic and when I’m tired I can sleep and when I don’t have the answers, I’ll pray. I’ll reach out. I’m not ALONE ANYMORE!!!!”

\- “Maybe it might be time to face it”

\- “It is. Now shut the fuck up. This dog has a race to run and I have food to eat""

At the times it gets too painful to hold on, the exact time where Im about to begin to reap the benefits of the blisters of holding on, I LET GO.

\-Who do I think I am? Haven't I had enough of making people who care for me feel terrible JUST so I can pursue pleasure? Haven't I had enough of the disappointed faces of the people I look up to? Haven't I had enough of not being able to reach my true potential? Haven't I had enough of constantly playing the victim? Haven't I had enough of all the different vast temporary pleasures and highs of the world? Haven't I had enough realizations that these pleasures are nothing more than mere illusions projected by society that make me more and more depressed? Haven't I had enough? Haven't YOU had enough? Haven't WE had enough?

\-Growing up moving from city to city, country to country I yearned meaningful and lasting connection. 8 different schools in the span of my years through kindergarten to graduating high school. I met all types of people, and I got good at it too over the years. I learned to act a certain way to make people like me and to fit in. Making friends was never a problem. Everywhere I went I found ways to stand out, somehow, someway make it known that I was there. To be the center of attention. I would get into fights, argue with teachers and ONLY follow the UNCONSCIOUS rules that I had set for myself. I thrived from attention it was the first high I felt, the first pleasure.

\-I started to grow a severe resentment for authority. People telling me that I had to live my life by a certain set of rules. I always saw rules as something that limited my freedom. Whether it was the teachers in school telling me I cant paint the tree red, or the dean of discipline suspending me for wearing hoodies, or my parents telling whats right and whats wrong, when to come home or how to act. Even though all of these people had wanted nothing but the best for me, even though I didn't understand it , I resented it. You can either live your life following a set of certain rules/values, or live with no rules/values then start to unconsciously make it up as we live, by the way we are living.

\-The problem with my resentment to authority was I stopped listening to people who actually knew better than me. I started to tell myself that everything I went through was completely different from the events in their life. That somehow the advice they give me was irrelevant and couldn't help me. I believed if I were to listen to the rules everyone goes by, I would end up just like everyone. That I would give in and conform with the ordinary ways of society. I didn't want that and still don't. Maybe this was do to my way of always having the ability to be the cause of trouble no matter what setting. Maybe they didn't talk to me they should have talked. Maybe they yelled too much. Maybe they got mad too much. Maybe they didn't know how to talk to a kid like me . Or maybe they did everything perfectly but my internal attitude and outlook to the world was the reason I wasn't open to their influence. In the end, whosever fault it is, it is my responsibility to create the life I deserve.

\-Despite my pursue of attention and constantly putting myself on the spot, I was a very reserved, shy and insecure kid at heart growing up. I couldn't speak to girls directly until well into my teen years. My outgoingness was just a mask for attention. I desired women but couldn't do much about it. So I became good at that. I learned how to talk to women, spike their interest and attraction towards me. All I ever wanted was for girls to holler back plus a little respect. Validation.

\-Then high school came to end. College started. I had freedom from all the rules that I had been placed under by both parents and society. I started jumping from girl to girl, blondes to brunettes, asians to europeans. To do this I had to go out a lot to meet people. I searched for hope in meaningless places doing meaningless things trying to build meaningless relationships. Going from one big party to the next, one smoke session to the next. Life became a constant question of ""Whats  
Next?"" By this time I had been smoking weed frequently since high school and believed that these were the only ways to genuine and meaningful connection.

\-When college came around my addictive personality expanded its vices; the attention, lust, nicotine, marijuana. They days that I spent sitting and smoking weed with friends ALL day, INCREASED. They quality of my relationships, my grades, my drive, my faith to my religion Islam, and GOD decreased dramatically. By trying to fill up my need for connection and by trying to ""find myself"" I actually lost who I was. I was running the opposite direction of everything I knew to be right. Inner battles emerged. Depression kicked in. There would be days I would sleep up to 18 hours and still wake up extremely tired. Drug addiction and depression doesn't blend, an endless rabbit hole to misery. Misery loves company. That is why people love smoking and drinking together. They're miserable. I was miserable. I was at rockbottom. They say there is light at the end of every tunnel, but not if your eyes adjusts to the darkness...

\-By this time, I had tried quitting weed many times before. I went months of being clean. Sobriety was the ONLY answer to all my problems that I had created for myself. I knew that. It was my only option to live the life I deserve. It is still my only option to be able to become the man to contribute to changing the world and the people in it. Sobriety changed my focus from planning out when I would smoke or who I would sleep with next to bigger and better ideas.

\-It has been almost a year since this low-point in my life. I was able to be sober and grow for 7 months. I was truly happy in the purest of forms. I wouldn't even call it happiness because it was something way more. A combination of self-respect, inner peace and the feeling of knowing you are on your purpose that gave me this ultimate sense of well being. I had my emotions back, my dopamine levels were regulated, I wasn't chasing temporary pleasures. And for the first time in a long time, I felt connection. The connection I was searching for most of my teens. The CRAZY thing is that it was nothing as I had pictured. I didn't have all of these people around me laughing, having fun. I didn't have friends that I would go out with every night. I dint have pretty girls on my phone texting and telling me they love me. I completely isolated. I didn't need other people to make me feel good. I didn't feel the need to change my internal state. Not because everything was perfect in my life. No. Things were not always perfect because they never are. I had bad days, sleepless nights, stress, frustrations that come from change and pushing yourself to your limits. The only difference was that I wasn't running to weed or other worldly pleasures to help fight these emotions. I had gained the ability to ride it out. To take the emotions as they came and know that they will subside.

\-Almost 2 months ago, I relapsed. It was mostly out of nowhere but I saw it coming. I got cocky and arrogant. My life was good. I thought that I was done with weed, it was a thing for me of the past. So even if I smoked just once I would be able to stop right away. This is addiction talking. Because boy was I wrong. Every time I relapse I binge. I buy so much weed so ""it could be a good last smoking session. "" Then do the same thing the next day then the next till I realize I been smoking everyday for a week. I don't see what Im doing until it is already done, which kickstarts the guilt of intemperance (knowing what I am doing is wrong but doing it anyway.)

\-Most stoners know exactly how just a little bit of guilt is enough to get them to relapse immediately. When this sense of guilt comes from relapsing weed, you have more of a reason to smoke the next day. Then comes the even greater guilt of disappointing the people that you promised you would stop. After comes the even greater guilt of these same people looking down on you, thinking you do not care about them enough and that you are not mentally strong enough to overcome marijuana.

\-Its a vicious loop that never reveals itself to you.

\-But I HAD ENOUGH. I hope you did too. Today I am making the decision to connect myself to my core. To isolate and grow. To build a meaningful connection, not with meaningless relationships, but with the relation I have with myself. Because once I have a strong connection with myself, connecting to everything and everyone becomes effortless, and the gap in my soul slowly begins to fill.

\-Today is Day 1. Again. This time for the last time. Day 1 of the life that I deserve. Day 1 of the life I will manifest. Day 1 of the life I was sent here to live.

Just because it has to be said, I'm a 19yo guy.

&#x200B;

A little (too much, sorry) backstory to understand this better ; I am someone who takes pride in trying to be nice to everyone unless they show me they don't deserve it. So basically, I try my best to be a nice person, and **hearing about wholesome stories/videos warms my heart a lot**.

Another thing before I go on, is that it's been about 7 years since I got into video games (and watching videos on youtube) so much that I pretty much stopped studying. That doesn't mean I don't go to school, it's just that I don't do my homework or learn stuff for test, which is a problem of it's own, but that's not the topic, so please don't call me out on that.

Last thing, is that I have a lot of struggle to have any IRL social interactions, even with my friends. I am way too easily embarrassed and shy, and when I see someone else embarrassed, be that IRL, or on video, or whatever... it makes me cringe to no end sometimes. Because I relate so much that I feel like I'm the one being embarrassed...

\--

So, it's been about 2 or 3 months since I've discovered a child's show that you probably all know either from your childhood or by name, *My little pony: Friendship is Magic*.

I never watched this show (or any like it as a matter of fact), and I always thought it was just a poorly acted, cheesy show for kids. And if people like to watch this kind of things even as adult, I don't have a problem with that, but I know most people do, so I don't say it. (Which is why i'm on a secondary account btw.)

&#x200B;

About half a year ago, I started watching Disney or Pixar movie animation, like the 3 Cars movie, or the 3 ""How to train your dragons"", or Zootopia, and so on. Thoses are movies that always ends well and are mostly targeted for kids, but they warm my heart a lot. And after I started to struggle to find more movies like this that I'd want to watch, I don't remember how, but ""My little pony"" eventually came to mind. I realized I never knew what it was, and I thought about watching a few episodes, just so I could make my mind.

&#x200B;

And about 2 or 3 months ago.. I did just that. I watched the very first episode (which is actualy in 2 parts). I cringed a lot for reasons said before, I realised it indeed was cheesy, but when everything turned out to be fine by the end of it, it warmed my heart a little bit. And I thought, ""Well, I guess I could keep watching one more, to really make my mind"". So I watched another one. And another one.

I think I watched like 10 of them. Each one is 22 minutes long for the record.

I ended up really liking it by each episode that finished. To the point that sometimes, just thinking back to some episode can lighten my mood. And thinking about the episode I will watch later, gets me really excited.

Since then, as of 25th January ; there are 26 episodes/season, there are 9 seasons in total... and I have watched half of it all.

&#x200B;

And today, I couldn't seem to do anything else. When I finished watching an episode, I reminisced on it a bit to myself, and then, I just wanted to watch the next one, and the next one. I tried to think of what else to do, but I couldn't bring myself to do something else. I watched a YouTube video or two, or played a game for like 20minutes between some episodes... but then I really felt the urge to watch another episode. Which means that... I had no time to do anything else.

As I said before, I don't personally have any sort of problem with what people like to do in their free time, but... I really feel like i'm wasting my time by doing only ONE thing of the whole day...

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I really like watching that show, I really really do... But I feel like I'm wasting my time by doing only that, and I don't know how to stop this... when I try to do something else, my urge to watch it just grows stronger.

Anyone has any idea, or even just thoughts about this ?

This isn’t much of an “addiction” post, but rather the opposite. I don’t ever get withdrawals from anything. Grew up in Los Angeles, meaning lots of drugs and alcohol, so I’m no stranger to addictive substances. Middle school and high school, like everyone, was filled with pot, liquor, and experimenting with different substances at parties and what not. The difference with me is that I never got hooked on anything I ever did. I’d always believe I was addicted to cigarettes, weed, and etc... but I never got withdrawals. Throughout my life I always have occasional periods where I’d go sober for months, and sometimes up to a year. The reasoning behind that is the same every time. I either forget or become busy. Oh, I go cold turkey too... don’t feel anything. I recently started smoking cigarettes again because life was going well... and because I could. I am currently not being overwhelmed by life thankfully. I’ve been smoking kush, cigarettes, and drinking on my free time everyday after work or studies for a good 4-5 months up until two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, I wanted to see if I became hooked on anything. I’ve been sober since. I feel no physical or mental withdrawals. Now, I’m curious if this is normal, or if anyone else feels this way... Maybe I’m still an addict, but I get less symptoms? No clue.

I hope this is ok to post this here. I’m just looking for more info

Long story short, my ex had a long history of use. Met him in recovery. Weeks ago, he stole my car and wouldn’t return it. 

He “got it cleaned” but not detailed. I found a generic viagra in the dash in a shady looking plastic from a cigarette box. 


Well, I just went to the car to find something totally unrelated (he returned it 2-3 weeks ago) and I pulled up the carpet.... I could be crazy but it looked like there were little specks of crack. I want to reiterate... I’ve seen him in relapse before. I’ve dealt w this stuff. And I’m in the south.. so it’s not like it’s salt from the snow or anything. It looks weird

Then I looked under the driver side and there’s a penny, half all messed up, half normal. I remember from his relapses years ago he did something with a penny, but I don’t know what. (Maybe to break down coke/meth?)

Is this possible?  I didn’t touch anything because I don’t want to be connected to it. But if it is something, I can’t be driving around with it.

One cousin in particular who is my age (25) is very important to me. We grew up together, went to the same school and been very close all through childhood and teenage years. However, during 20's we drifted apart due to me moving to another country and studying, and him for most part working and partying. 

In the start, I would think the partying is something he has to go through, I did party in my early ears myself and have tried numerous drugs, but it stayed at that, trying. However for the past year I am really worried about him and his substance abuse. 

Although for the most part I dont know how much he uses as we live in different countries and he is reluctant to share most details with me as he knows I would tell him to slow down and be carefull. He is in raves a lot and told me about the use of MDMA before, he goes to these raves atleast twice a month, and I guess he is not sober in any of them.

My worries started when he came to visit me about a year and a half ago, and was persistent to get cocaine when we were out in the city, and it didnt end there, he ended up using it most nights of his visit or stayed very quite/passive on the night he didnt. On top of this he was smoking weed everyday, as it is easy to get where I live. 

Last year, he told me how he took magic mushrooms and after he has quit smoking (cigarettes) and doesnt feel drawn to cocaine anymore. Instead, I am now hearing stories of him using LSD and mushrooms quite often, he is still a heavy MJ smoker and drink quite a lot. I feel like he just would do anything to just not be sober.  

I am at this point where I graduated and now am looking to start my career, and I feel like we have nothing in common. Most of the conversations he starts are either about raves, psychadelic trips and parties, and I can't really relate. 

The numerous times I have tried to approach him about this substance use, he just dismisses it or gets upset with phrases like: 'its nice you think I am a junkie' or ' whats your problem? I have a job and a place to stay'.. that context. 

I am very worried about his habits, and dont know how to deal with the situation. None of my other family are aware about this. I mean they dont even know he smokes weed( that unaware). I just feel like I need to help him before it gets worst, I feel like I am responsible in the situation because I am aware of it. How can I help someone that doesnt think they have a problem? any advice welcome..

I feel like this platform is the only way I can do it given the anonymity that comes with reddit. 

I live in a state where most of the calendar year is snow and the temperature is below zero. Up until this last summer of 2019 I was 3 years clean off heroin. My whole life I've been involved with some sort of debauchery or shenanigans. When I was 7 my brothers convinced me to smoke my first of many cigarettes. At 9 they handed me my first joint. At 10 I was breaking into cars and attempting to sell what I had stolen for lunch money at school, sounds like a joke, but I loved those extra slices of pizza and chocolate milk. 

At 13 after being placed into the system I started smoking weed regularly and all around not doing much. At 16 I found out the vicodin they gave me when I broke my wrist did a lot more than just make me groggy and tired. It was then I thought I found true love. 

At 17 I started smoking them. At 20 I moved to OxyContin 30, smoking two, maybe 3, one after another. I love smelling that sweet, toasted marshmallow scented smoke. At 21 I found heroin. After moving to another state with a little more freedom to experiment without feeling judged by my small community, I went all out. I think I can name more drugs I haven't tried than I have tried. I was stealing from stores like Walmart, fred meyer. Bringing product to my dealer for half price, usually getting weed, heroin and meth all at once. It caught up with me. Got stopped at Walmart with 354 dollars worth of merch and got into some legal trouble. 

I confided in a buddy of mine about my condition and he reminded me that he owed me 300 dollars and he could fly me back home and help me out. I had him book me a flight for a week later so I could hitchhike to the nearest airport and not be withdrawing the entire time. This is what convinced me to never do this drug again. It felt like my veins were itchy, the sweats, borderline convulsions because you're shivering from the bone aching cold and there's fire in your muscles, you cant move too much or you'll gag but nothing will come out because you haven't eaten anything real in probably a week. The single worst thing I've ever been through in my life.

I left the day before my flight and spent about ten hours hitchhiking going from city to city and eventually getting to the airport and finally making it home. 

After all that I vowed to never do heroin again... until about July of 2019, I relapsed hard. My wife doesn't know about it still but I did a half gram of tar in about ten minutes with the same buddy who flew me home to get away from it. I ruined three years of sobriety to try and have a good time with someone who isn't active in my life today. I still feel like shit about this and pretend to be excited when my wife brings up how long I've been sober and how proud of me she is. 

This is the first time I told a soul about this relapse and I hope there aren't anymore.

Now at 25, I have a daughter, my own place, a woman that makes me feel better than any drug possibly could. But that doesn't always fix an addiction. It still lurks over me like a vulture every day of my life but I always tell myself it isn't worth it.

It is how I am, and this is the first time I have put it in words  but here goes...

As addicts of any kind, we play with death until it's not just a casual acquaintance to us. Many times, it becomes a friend and we beckon it. However, there's either one of two types of people when it comes to addicts and ""normal "" people. Those are the people who become revolted by their own devices and in realizing that they've been skipping alongside the grim reaper rather happily,  and those, in whom something very deeply ingrained within themselves instead rejoices in that fact and wants to bekon it a little more often and draw it a little closer.

Does this make sense to anyone? When I'm on a terror of a run, there is a part of me, or another me, or my addiction and it's end game is death and part of me isnt just cool with it, but part of me is totally down to do it. . I don't remember how that feeling started but in hindsight, I can't remember feeling any differently. JFC. What the fuck *IS* that??? Do I really hate myself that bad? Part of me says ""maybe"". I hate this whatever you want to call it. It's the only fucking thing in the world that tries to creep in at every level of consciousness including my dreams while I am sleeping. It's the only thing that'll have you throwing away all the people you love as you're suffering and selling the things you love. Or selling the people you love.  If there's anything in the world that can make a reasonably and commonly decent person fall from Grace that hard, it is fucking addiction.

I've had a real wild last 10-15 years. I'm just now, after a 2 year struggle to get clean after going out with just under 10, am actually accruing *consecutive months* outside of the confines of jail or court ordered bullshit. All I had to do was take subs and an SSRI, and leave my spouse whom I adored, 90% of my family, my home, and my life up to that point. I want to make it so fucking bad. I just want to do something in life that is good for me *and* curbs my appetite for any and everything. I just dont want to feel so empty and it's hard not to as I sort out the wreckage I caused in my life.

Part of me is still paralyzed.  I can't do the meetings and the Fucking Fellowship. I've always been a loner but I never had this much trouble letting *anyone* in. I feel like I just want to lay low and stay the fuck in this winter. Maybe I need a period of cold, quiet reflection. Maybe I'll make it to outstretch my leaves or bloom in the spring. But I do know one thing, I just gotta stay planted and not run. Just rest my neck a bit.

And, this got way longer than i meant for it to get   Oops.My bad for real

That was about 2 months ago, and since then I have been saying to myself that I will not do it again after I have used it. However, the next day I return to using it... I am not totally unproductive while using it, I keep myself busy doing homework for classes that just started, but a lot of the time I end up putting the energy that the pills give me to ""perfect"" my stream for overwatch (lol i know its a dead game). I feel guilty, and angry with myself... but really find it hard to stop. Any tips on what to do from this point would be very helpful.

2020-01-20 12:28:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ergd2k/losing_hope/,Losing Hope,"So a little background, 4 years ago my family and I found out that my sibling is a severe alcoholic. They moved to a large city on their own when they turned 18 and everything seemed to be going well for the majority of the time they were there. That was nearly 20 years ago. Fast forward to 4 years ago we learn that things are not going well at all. My sibling's boss even admitted to my mother that for a full year they were being kept on at their job unable to do anything because they were so inebriated every day. The boss was quite good friends with my sibling prior to that so felt a certain amount of loyalty.

My parents and sibling both decided it would be best if they moved home for a while, that was 3 years ago. In that time my sibling has gotten divorced from their spouse, ran through a series of menial jobs each time getting fired because of drinking, ended up in detox once, and hospitalized twice. After all of this my sibling STILL refuses to even admit that drinking is a problem. It's a level of denial that still blows me away three years on. My sibling will drink in front of you and tell you that they are not drinking and even become angry if you don't believe them!  Needless to say my family is exhausted. My sibling has been living with my parents for three years, unemployed most of the time, in HUGE amounts of debt(the 2nd hospital stay alone cost 12 grand and they started drinking immediately after getting out) my sibling is also addicted to adderol and has a deadbeat partner that me and my family hate but my sibling keeps going back to because they enable each other and probably the partner can get other drugs which I suspect might be involved.

Sibling refuses to go to meetings and therapy or will go for a while and gradually stop. I honestly have no idea what to do at this point. Are there counselors that council families dealing with addicts that can help us figure out what to do with them? To me the biggest barrier is that my sibling is allowed to stay at my parents house rent free which means they never have to get any better. On the other hand they have burned every bridge and if kicked out would be homeless. We're all at the end of our ropes and would appreciate any advice.

It all started because I have a debilitating fear of pain but only in my abdomen/chest. Whenever I start to feel even slightly nauseous or sick I panic and begin to contemplate suicide because I would rather die than be ill. I had several bad experiences with abdominal pain earlier in the year which caused me to be so scared of it happening again. A few of these experiences were while using the bathroom so I have a ritual for how I use the bathroom now to prevent me from worrying that it’ll happen again. Lights off, phone out of the room, windows closed. It was the opposite when I was ill previously.

Another contributing factor is that my sister’s very ill. She has Cystic Fibrosis (she had a double lung transplant at 15, 9 years ago), Type 1 Diabetes & Gastroparesis, to name a few. For my whole life I’ve always been witness to her screaming in pain, crawling along the floor or completely unconscious while we call an ambulance. We call at least 10 ambulances a year for her, I’m so used to it that I don’t really worry about her anymore, since she always comes back, no matter how bad things get. When I was young though, seeing this was difficult. My sister had always been prescribed Co-Codamol (30/500) and prolonged release Morphine. She’s become addicted to codeine and my mother has too, as my sister shares them with us since she has so many. My mother also gets her own prescription and gives me some. I’ve always taken Co-Codamol, even for minor pain, my mother would give me it as if it was just store bought paracetamol. I didn’t take it too much (only when I felt any sort of minor pain and panicked) but some time around September I suddenly began taking it way more often.

At the point I’m at now, I take 120mg of codeine and 2g of paracetamol every night. On some days it’ll be 240mg & 4g, like tonight. If I don’t take it, I begin to feel ill and worry, and since that’s my biggest fear I come right back to it. I have to take it daily. I’ve been stealing my grandmother’s partner’s prescriptions since November, as she uses them but goes through them extremely slowly. I think I’ve stolen over 250 pills since November, I’m sure. Something like that. She hasn’t noticed and I’m putting it to bad memory that comes with age. I feel awful, however. I can’t keep doing this.

I just don’t want to rely on them daily anymore but I’m so scared of illness, I don’t know what to do. I see several therapists and have been doing so for a while now due to my mental health. My next appointment is in 35 hours and I was going to bring this to their attention for the first time. I’m hoping that’s the correct thing to do.

Hi all. My boyfriend/ex-boyfriend went to rehab yesterday. He’s dabbled with all sorts of drugs for a long time and over the last few months his heroin use finally became a full-blown addiction. His parents found out and after a joint effort with them we managed to send him to a centre that will hopefully keep him safe and help him for the next 28 days.

Over the last while, I’ve watched him become selfish, mean, manipulative and cruel. This week, he confessed to me that he’d started injecting. He got so high yesterday that he didn’t even know where he was when his parents were driving him to rehab. I’m heartbroken for them that they had to see that. I’m told they’re crushed.

I imagine the above is familiar behaviour to many, but I just wanted to give you some context. I know I should now focus on retrieving some sanity, but I can’t stop thinking about what he must be doing and feeling. (Part of me hopes there’s a healthy amount of guilt involved.) 

For those of you who have gone to rehab, what happens in the first few days? Both in practical terms, but also 1 what thoughts/feelings go through your head? Anger, fear, resentment? Hope? Guilt? I’m sure it’s different for everyone, but I’m genuinely curious.

2020-01-19 15:26:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/er1pwf/seeking_advice/,Seeking advice!,"To start, I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years this month. During that time, he has hidden that he has a drug problem. I knew that he would take pills/coke here and there but thought it was just sometimes and for fun. It escalated last year when he was using coke constantly and lying about it. He would wake me up every hour with all these paranoid accusations of stuff he would just make up and none of it made sense.   


He ended up going to rehab last year and to my knowledge, I thought he didn't pick it back up. Since then his dad has passed and I noticed he was acting strange again. He starting using coke & pills again, and refuses to go to rehab or see a counselor. He just started a new job, and so only allows himself to do it on his days off. In doing so, he stays up all night and then when I go to work the next day he harasses me with nonsense of how I'm cheating on him, or to explain this or that, making up a lot of stuff. It's not as intense as it was last year, and my reactions are a lot different as well. I tend to just ignore him and sleep in another room. I figure if I don't participate then he will leave me alone.   


I used to have the urge to want to talk to him about this, and let him know how much it hurt me and expected an apology for how he treated me.. although it always ended in a fight and he would say to drop it and it was the drug, not him. He lies to me all the time, saying he is going to the store or a friends, and he will come back high.   


When he does go for awhile without using, he will say he needs pills instead so he doesn't end up doing coke. And I shouldn't have a problem with it since he's not using coke. If I try to push it, he says that talking about it is going to end up with him going out and getting coke if I don't stop.   


The other night he told me he thinks he would be able to quit no problem if he has a job he is passionate about and something he loves doing. Then it was brought up how if I stay with him or leave him, he's still gonna be doing this. It doesn't matter. That he would figure out what days he has our daughter and then make sure not to use it then.  


This was really a stab in the heart for me and over the past few days, I have been thinking about leaving since I feel like I cannot help this situation or him anymore. We have been through the motions of this. Anger, sadness, patience, understanding. He doesn't seem to acknowledge this is a problem at all. Idk what to do anymore. I think it's time to let go and take care of myself since he doesn't understand or care to try to know how this is hurting me. It makes me angry that he doesn't even acknowledge my feelings, yet I try so hard to be patient for him.

2020-01-19 11:40:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/eqyk52/need_help_from_relapsing_on_black/,Need help from relapsing on black.,"About 3 years ago. I met a girl named(Cindy). In the beginning of the relationship she would cut herself and say she wanted to take her life causing me to leave work early to go check on her. First thing I did was go to her mother and let her know about the situation. The mom just kinda brushed it off(1st red flag) saying it was her bipolar disorder. It escalated to the pointe where she was saying that someone had broken into my car, etc. few months into our relationship she tries to fucking jump out my car at 80mph on the freeway while cutting herself, threw my phone at the windshield, karate chopped in the windpipe all at the same time. One time she tried to jump out the car threw my phone at the windshield and kicked in my ac vents. I took her and her nephews/niece to Disney and dinner to let the kids get some fresh air and a change of environment. I made a comment on how we could all use a shower afterwards and she grabs a bag of chips throws it all over my dash and again threw my phone at the windshield cracking it. Later I found out that she was a hardcore meth addict with meth induced bipolar symptoms. When confronted about her meth use she kept changing her stories on how she started using meth. First it was her brother in law, being drugged and waking up being raped in the back room, her pimp taking her and making her work, her neighbor across the street whom gave her meth when her grandmother passed away. Frigging stories kept changing and it broke me. A part of my soul died. When I saw her tweaking for the first time she had a high pulse, was twitching, mumbling... I didn’t know if I needed to call 911 or an ambulance or something. I ended up going to a dispensary and begging them for help. They hooked me up with some edibles and gummies to put in her drink so she could come down. She’s smoking a quarter a day and she doesn’t see it as a problem. Since she gets her meth for “free” she’s always tweaking, not sleeping, doesn’t remember anything from the previous day. Back in September I found a video of her passed out being violated. I relapsed on black tar heroin because I just wanted to forget what I had seen. Little by little I began to see holes in her stories small inconsistencies. I ended up becoming a coaddict along with her. She would get me high. Then jack my stuff, phones, wallets, jewelry, etc. she thought I was high but in reality I knew what she was doing. I never confronted her about it but always asked if there was anything she wanted to tell me. Then she would look down with a solemn look on her face. I regret not confronting the issue then and there. Shit hit the fan when she and her sister tried to use my credit cards to pay her overdue bills. I did some digging and found out the type of individual she was. I went on a crazy journey trying to help her finding people from all walks of life. I ended up sitting across from neo nazis, white supremacists, ended up getting involved with the Mexican cartels, Russian mob/mafia. I even fucking ended up in a satanic worshipping den. Why? Because I thought she told me the truth regarding her past and I wanted to hep her like she helped me during a difficult time. Granted I do feel responsible for her relapse. We both lied and used each other. She claimed she was pregnant when she wasn’t. I asked her to marry me but once I found out she’d been married and divorced multiple times I tried to get outta there fast I could. We admitted that we were both using each other and just decided to stay friends. Last few instances she tried to get me so high on meth so she could steal my cc info, etc. she left her little bag of meth on the floor where a 2 week old baby husky was able to get to eat and eat it. She didn’t even tell me that the dog had ate meth until almost 6 months later after it had happened... found more videos of her online which Fucking broke me again. When confronted she denied at first before admitting the truth. I wasn’t even mad just wanted the truth I knew everything she’d been doing yet she kept denying to the very end. She likes to hangout at underground gambling dens. Spending what little cash she has on these fish games. I think I have PTSD from everything I’ve been through. I recently read an article regarding Stockholm syndrome and was wondering if that’s what I have. 

Essentially she lied and manipulated me in the very beginning saying she was pregnant when she really wasn’t getting me to open up to her. Before I started noticing the lies. She said she wanted to have the drug dealer across the street arrested and was throwing a tantrum about it. But I think she only had him arrested so she could take over his business. 

Honestly she’s a lost soul. And I’m worried bout her but how the fuck can I overcome my PTSD. Before I met her I was the outgoing, charismatic extrovert type. After my relationship to(Cindy) I have trust issues, paranoia and anxiety/depression. I just want to go back to the old me. Before I met her I wanted to change to world and make it a better place. I was working with my employer to fight hunger in the OC area. Now I’m just a shell of my former self. How can I fix my PTSD?

Also got pregnant a “second time” with her connect and she tried to guilt trip me into thinking it was mine.

Do I have ptsd? Stockholm? What can I do to move forward. Every time I see a video of her online. Fucks with me real bad and pushes me towards relapsing on heroin.  It’s only only thing that helps me forget.",10,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974831938743591}"

Today marks one year no cocaine for me and alcohol will be end of next month. If your reading this, I hope you realize that if you and I didn’t hit as low (or, maybe as low as you will keep hitting) as we did then we will never be as ‘high’ as we are now. Sure, high maybe not the best choice for an “addiction” sub well it’s meant as in high off yourself and your own self power. You have the power to control your life you just have to use it and if that requires submitting to outside help that’s okay too. To be honest , now, the thought of me actually using doesn’t scare me as much as the thought of how fast I could loose what I have created for myself. The first few months were terrifying and I felt so fragile. What has kept me sober is 1. Never forgetting or numbing out the low I felt the day I decided to get clean because I never wanna be there again and 2. How fucking amazing I feel and the drive I have to keep taking hold of my life. Now, tonight thinking to myself how fast this year of work could be gone if I let it AND how shitty it would be is a very satisfactory feeling. I have created so much space and peace for myself and it’s mortifying to think of fucking that up.

I hope this helped someone in some way.

I don't know how it is in the states but in my conversations with Americans, I have learned, that it is apparently easy to get Xans in an illegal way, which is even worse than the Kpins you can buy on the street here in Europe.

Those must come from somewhere though, doctors making money by prescribing, pharmacies by looking away, this is not H or Cocaine which flows from war-torn countries, those are neatly packaged pills by Pfizer or Bayer or whoever. Do we have a Benzo epidemic already ongoing, that is invisible because it doesn't kill (except in the seldom case of a really bad withdrawal) but turns thousands, maybe tens of thousands into illicit users and also basically benzo-zombies because the withdrawal of Kpins or god-forbid Xans is a horror show even compared to opiates. It is also invisible because people can keep working fine until their dose is 2 or 3 whole stripes of X/K a day and it starts getting expensive enough to ruin even the life of a person with a steady job.

Aside from a surplus of knowledge on statistics and research methods, (was this just psych at my school or everyone else's too?), the number one thing my degree taught me was that ANYONE can benefit from therapy. Unfortunately, it can be very difficult for people to realize, and especially admit, that they should go. I apologize in advance, this is a lengthy read. My goal is to ensure that it is at least well-written while also providing enough info to properly represent the situation. 

Here's where I'm at -- he left today with our only vehicle. I don't know where he went or when he's coming back. Quite frankly, I don't care. I can only assume that he is doing the same thing he did two years ago when we first broke up. Hitting the road for a while to build music festivals in order to escape. 

To give a bit of background on why we first broke up, (which lasted a year to the same month - funny how that worked), he got extremely wrapped up in methamphetamines. He was an IV user. Up for days at a time, porn addiction, stuff everywhere from unfinished projects, allowing other meth addicts to move in, the whole shebang. He was in a dark time and I became romantically entangled while he was on the downfall, headed straight to rock bottom. I stayed because I thought I could help him. It resulted in me becoming a glutton for punishment and nothing short of an iron will and unconditional love kept me going.

I didn't meet him when he was like this. At 17 I became his assistant. He was a wonderful, sweet, caring, handsome, and amazingly intelligent man. It was like we were twins separated at birth. We enjoyed every moment together and he became a best friend. Two years later he collapsed under the pressures of our modern life. Realizing that ""stuff"" wasn't happiness, the toxic relationships in his life, everything that comes with what can be a very tumultuous realization. 

For the past couple years, aside from one slip-up where I came home early from school to find him methed out his gourd shooting up in the bathroom, everything has been fine for the most part and he hasn't been using. It wasn't until we moved into a travel trailer and then started staying on the property of a meth-user while waiting to go back on the road. It has been about 4 months. Since day one he was not able to resist the temptation and it has only been getting worse. 

He is a huge denier. Will look me in the eye and lie to me with a poker face that would even have betazoids convinced their feelings are false (Star-Trek reference for those that didn't catch it). To continue to put this into perspective, I have even picked a METH COVERED BOOGER out of his nose and then ATE THE BOOGER right in front of him after he tried denying the white powder I was looking at. He refused to eat the booger and taste it for himself. He would attribute his dilated pupils, antic behavior, not sleeping or eating, to being on LSD. I thought some of the particularities were not characteristic of someone on acid, but eventually let him convince me that I'm a crazy bitch (his words) and he has been clean. 

No more than a couple days after deciding I need to once again try to collect what little trust I have left does the guy living here, (who has NO reason to lie to me), tell me he has been sneaking down there to do meth at any opportunity. He told me I didn't hear it from him, but knows I'm not ok with it, (I made this crystal clear, pun not intended, to everyone living in that house), and thought I should know. Why does this guy care that he does meth and hides it? He knows it's bad, not just for my trust but also for his life. He's just an old man who lost his family and doesn't give a fuck anymore. I was told this very touching story about how if he had made better decisions his wife and daughters would still be with him. He sees the potential in my boyfriend, in me, and in our relationship. 

After a while of mulling it over and phoning a friend I decided to confront him about it. I didn't hear it from the homeowner, but rather told him that because I know him so well, I can tell he is using. I didn't even get through the rest of what I was gonna say when he hopped up and straight into a fit of rage. I begged him to please calm down, don't throw things, I'm coming to you out of love and concern, etc... It didn't matter. This was my fault because he told me to ""not come at him again with this shit"". When he came back for the rest of his stuff he became calm enough to let me talk to him. Although he refused to look me in the eye, he listened to me tell him how much I love him and that I know our relationship can flourish and become something beautiful, but I need his help. 

Despite this, he made it very clear that he is pissed at me and wants me to suffer. I sold my vehicle when we moved into the RV because it just isn't practical to have two. He also drained the account, despite my name being on it, and left me with only the $20 I have in my wallet. He also took the computer. I have no way to work. He told me that I deserve to lose this RV after I'm unable to make payments. All because I couldn't ""keep my fucking mouth shut"". 

I'm not even entirely sure how I feel. Hurt, disappointed, confused, to name a few. At this point, I suppose I'm looking for advice of all kinds.  Because when it comes down to it, I'm only 23 years into this journey and I've got a lot to learn.

Edit: He also left behind two dogs and a Travel trailer that can't be moved off this property without a vehicle. It is under my name. So is the truck, but I don't care to fight him for it. Once again crawling back to my family or going to a shelter is not an option.

Please feel free to comment your own addictions or recovery or advice, I’m hoping to find some connections here with people who understand the struggle.

So I’ll start by clarifying that by speed I’m referring to those nasty bathtub tabs of amphetamines, meth, and whatever else they decide to throw in. 

It started as mixing speed with cocaine socially and rapidly progressed into needing to take between 4 to 12 tabs before I can get out of bed in the morning (for 6 years now).

I’ve been a semi high functioning addict, mainly because I’ve been able to afford speed AND still have groceries in the fridge. I was also able to slide by with passing grades in university for a while, the speed helped me focus at first. But I’ve been slowly failing out of school for a while now because my memory and ability to understand information has deteriorated so much. 

I’m tired of hiding my struggle from my family and boyfriend, I’m tired of lying to everyone, but I’m so scared to lose everyone if I tell them how much I’ve manipulated them. I want to be able to survive without speed so badly, I just don’t know how that’s possible now. 

Without speed, I can’t control my emotions, my cognition is so foggy, I sleep for 20 hours a day for weeks, I can’t take care of my dogs, I can’t go to work, I can’t drive without falling asleep, my eyesight even gets blurry, I don’t even have enough energy to speak.

I’m looking into starting counselling for drug abuse and finding medical help, but I just made this Reddit account to chronicle my ups and downs, my failures and (hopeful) successes, and find other people who have gone through this or can offer advice.

Addiction runs strong in my family and I've seen up close and personal how addiction can tear a person apart. My Mom is now sober and I am extremely grateful for that.

I feel a strong drive to use things I should never use and constantly think of ways I could get a hold of something. I've only drank and smoked weed a handful of times- so it feels ridiculous to call myself an addict.

I wish it wasn't me who was writing this.  I really wish it wasn't.  I wish I wasn't handpicked because I have one of the ""best handles"" on this subject.  I wish I wasn't ""qualified"" to speak on the heroin epidemic that is a growing problem nationwide.  I wish I wasn't a member of a community no one really wants to be a part of.  No one ever says to themselves while reading stuff like mine, ""I wish I could relate to this.""

But I am.  I am the non-addict who knows all too well what it's like to have an addict in the family.

I know what it's like to worry yourself sick.  To cry yourself to sleep.  To stare at baby pictures & reminisce.  To check on them while they sleep to make sure they are still breathing.

I know to watch out for pinhole pupils and subtle changes in behavior.  To listen to them talk and make excuses and pile on lie after lie.  I know what it's like to pretend to believe them because you are just too mentally exhausted for an argument when you know they are lying straight to your face.

I know what it's like to be confused all the damn time; to see their potential, to know what they are throwing away.

I know what it's like to want their recovery more than they do.  To be the one doing research on rehabs and other outlets for recovery.

I know what it's like to miss someone who is still standing right in front of you.

I know what it's like to wonder if each unexpected phone call is ""the"" phone call.  I know what it's like to be hurt so bad and be made so sick that part of you wishes you would just get ""the"" phone call if nothing is going to change.  You want that finality.  You need the cycle to end.  I know what it's like to hate yourself for even allowing yourself to find relief in that horrible thought.

I know what it's like to get the worst news of your life, and still walk into the grocery store and run your errands and smile at the cashier.

I know what it's like to become a part-time detective.  To snoop through drawers and texts.  You know you are going to find something, and you look until you do just so you feel less crazy.  So you can say to yourself, ""I am not paranoid.  This is happening again.""

I know what it's like to have your mind clouded; to turn into a functioning zombie.  I know what it's like to be physically present at board meetings and dinner dates, but mentally gone.

I know what it's like to stop caring about your own personal and professional life.  My relationship took a backseat, Christ not even the backseat - I kicked him out of the car.  I would show up to work not showered and with huge bags under my eyes.  I would cry at my desk.

Everything the outside world expected of me seemed frivolous if I couldn't keep one of my most important people in my life out of harm's way.

I know what it's like to be really pissed off.  Like, REALLY pissed the hell off.  Between the sadness there is a lot of anger.  I know what it's like to feel guilty for being so mad, even knowing all you know about addiction.  You are allowed to be angry.  This is not the life you signed up for.

I know what it's like to scour a bookshelf and not find what you are looking for because this illness is still so hard to talk about, let alone right write about.

I know what it's like to hear someone argue that addiction is not an illness, that it is a choice.  I know all too well that feeling of heat rising in your face as they go on and on about something they know nothing about.

I know what it's like to stop becoming angry with these people.  They do not understand.  They are lucky to not understand.  I know what it is like to catch yourself wishing that you didn't understand either.

I know the difference between enabling and empowering.  I know there is a fine line between the two and the difference can mean life or death.  I know what it's like to the feel the weight of each day on your shoulders trying to balance the two.

I have been through enough to know that things don't just change for the worse overnight; they can change in a millisecond.  In a blink of an eye.  As quick as it takes two people to make a $10 exchange.

I know what it's like to feel stigmatized.  To be the ""sister of a drug addict,"" a ""friend of a drug addict,"" ""the daughter of a drug addict.""  I know what it feels like to be handled with kid-gloves because no one outside of your toxic bubble knows what to say to help.

I don't know what the future holds for anyone who loves an addict today.  One thing I know for sure is I am not alone.

2020-01-15 19:06:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/epaytc/massage_therapist_on_adderall_addiction_story/,Massage Therapist on Adderall (Addiction Story),"I am currently a male Massage Therapist, graduated in 2014. This is my story of my adderall addiction.

&#x200B;

19 Years young, 2015 Spring is when I first took my first Adderall pill. Round & Pink 20 mg that I got from a friend that was diagnosed with ADHD, said he didnt like taking them alone and also didnt want to take all of them. I was going on a continuing education class in Arizona for FST Level 1 (FST) and my friend gave me 3 pills of 20mg pills of adderall. The only thing he asked me to do was not take more than one. I eased myself in by just taking 10mg each day I was out there. I gotta say it's a crazy stimulant that pushed myself into a new me, felt more confident about everything that I did, more focused and driven to do so much. My friend was my source of addy because he would just hand me a couple randomly whenever we hang out, and we hung out occasionally. Before all of this I felt like I was going down an amazing path and felt like my life is coming together, but looking back I wish I didnt take that first pill. Let me explain...

&#x200B;

While on Addy I entered a honeymoon phase with this stimulant. Felt like I can get so much done, felt like I was on top of the world and no one can stop me. Felt like anything was possible to do. But as a massage therapist on a stimulant such as this its kind of counterintuitive. As a Licensed Massage Therapist (LMT) you must stay calm yet focused, figure out what is going on within the body that is on your table. Surprisingly it has increased my knowledge and flow within my massages. I started to create strokes that I've never learned in school that my clients would notice and acknowledge by saying, ""Wow, whatever you just did felt amazing!"" or ""How did you know that spot was tense? I never realized that spot was so tight"" Summing it up, the feedback from clients while i was on addy was usually a fat tip, repeat clients, and lots of referrals. And the best part... Time flew by so easily because addy would put me in a flow of focus that I didnt watch the time for each 90 min session. My shifts at the spa felt like a 1 hour cruise down a peaceful road. Keep in mind that I was only taking 10 mg per shift and I would work every other day because I knew if i took it every day I'd become dependent on it... I thought.

&#x200B;

Couple months pass and I decided to stop taking addy. I was self aware that I needed it to work. I stopped hanging out with that friend socially (still talk to him through the phone time to time) to resist the urge to ask for it or for him to hand me some. Started to feel less confident in myself and felt anxious to see my regular clientele. Felt less motivated to work, time felt slow af. So the withdrawals were tough on my end, but I managed to stop taking it entirely for about 5 years.

&#x200B;

That is until my mom started taking it. Living with my mom on addy was interesting, knowing that I used to take it and was aware of the come ups and the come downs, I knew she was on something until I found the pill bottle in her purse. She had 60 pills of a stronger dose of 30 mg per pill. That is when I started to take some again, it wont be that bad. Told myself ""Just a couple"" But this time this relapse is 10x worse. Every morning before she'd wake up I'd take 2-3 pills, but would ease myself from taking 1/2 the pill and work my way up to the full pill. Now the reason why this come around is worse is because I'm currently unemployed due to lack of renewing my license to massage in my current state, and was hoping that adderall was going to ""help"" me find my drive and motivation to get back on my feet and start working again. 

**EDIT**:  For non-experienced users of adderall, at first it may seem like a watered down ""limitless"" pill, which feels nice and euphoric, but extended use will uncover the negative side effects fairly quickly. Speaking to my old friend that has stopped taking adderall confessed that he was depressed for a long period of time and never wanted to hang out socially. He mentioned to me that the higher euphoric feel you get, the harder emotional crash you feel. And experiencing adderall come downs are f\*cking insane. 

&#x200B;

Coming down from an adderall high can go from unwanted emotional sadness to aggressive behavior to questioning life like its a waste of space on this earth. I have massaged during a come down and it felt like I was hurting multiple clients not giving a f\*ck what they needed and didnt care about them at all. (Never saw those clients ever again, and I'm glad because I started to become wreck-less) Started to question my morals for a long period of time which lead to me taking a break from massage completely to get my mind straight.

&#x200B;

One thing that I've learned in Massage Therapy School is..

* **""Self Awareness is the Healer""**

This goes with anything. It ties into massage therapy because clients become ""self aware"" of their body is in pain, so they seek for pain relief. You can be self aware of your own flaws such as carrying too much weight on your body. Once you're self aware that you feel out of shape you start to seek for nutrition guidance or personal training.

&#x200B;

For myself, I'm practicing my self awareness of knowing that I have an addictive personality. Currently I am 1 week off of any type of stimulant (Adderall, Caffeine, etc.) and I'm blessed to have stopped myself from taking more and also stopped depending on a pill to take control over my mind and body.

&#x200B;

So I'm curious about any other massage therapist out there, (because I know I'm not the only one) If you have any thoughts or comments about my story. Even if you've never taken Addy before or was curious about taking it while performing a massage. Or if anyone that is curious about my experience I would be glad to answer some questions.",18,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9863466620445251}"

My (20F) boyfriend (21M) is an alcoholic and I’m not sure how to help him anymore. We’ve been dating for almost 2 years but recently his drinking has gotten worse over the past couple of months. I’ve been dealing with some major PTSD symptoms so I wouldn’t be surprised if that contributed to his drinking as well. 
 
His father is an alcoholic and even though he knows that it’s hereditary but he promised that he wouldn’t get as bad. Lately however that hasn’t been the case, a couple days ago he called me at 5am (even though he knew I had to be up at 7am for an 8:30 class) to talk him down so he wouldn’t drive drunk to get food. I did but he could’ve gotten into so much trouble if he had gotten caught especially because not only was he drunk but his license was expired. This worries me because even though he drinks he’s always been good with knowing not to drive but this time he was so drunk he didn’t care.  Today he woke me up again so I could help him fall asleep because he had been up all night drinking and this messed up my entire morning and I wasn’t able to do the work I needed before my classes. I love him and I’m trying to be supportive especially because he was there for me when I was going through a rough time and I want to be able to do the same for him but this is a lot.  

I want to support him and be there for him but he doesn’t care about getting better. I’ve looked up and given him multiple resources, I’m there to talk him out of bad situations but it’s not helping. He wants me to be responsible for making him not drink which I don’t think is fair. Especially because we do long distance so sure he wouldn’t drink 2 weekends out of the month when we’re together but when we’re both at school I can’t stop him from drinking. I’m not his mother and even though I do work around harm reduction and trauma support I don’t have the capacity to work through my own trauma, be a full time student, work and be responsible for his drinking g problem. He mentioned that maybe he could take a semester off and work where I go to school and we live together and I don’t mind that but I told him the only way I’d be okay with that was if he did therapy while he was with me. He said he didn’t want to pay for it and would only pay for it if I paid for it which I think is completely unfair because I’m a full time student supporting myself through school and working 3 jobs to make ends meet (and I have my own therapy to pay for) while he gets pretty much everything paid for by his parents. 

I love him sooo much and I want to help him through this, but I’m not sure how to do that anymore without enabling him or taking on this responsibility. I’m tempted to reach out to his mother but I’m not sure how helpful that would be and I know he would be extremely upset with me.

Example: tonight at work I had to make a tough call (see my AITA thread I posted tonight for details if you’re curious). This decision at work’s got me anxious and feeling like I’m a horrible person. The way I responded to some commenters on my AITA post has got me feeling anxious and low and shitty about myself. Recently I had a dramatic relapse with my drinking in front of loved ones, and that’s got me feeling horrible too. 

I guess I’m just wondering how people keep moving when everything feels like the wrong move. And when you overthink yourself into being the bad guy time and time again.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992497563362122}"

No matter what your DOC is, it's the one that temporarily took away that pain, took the worlds hands off your throat. Unfortunately, in your life in particular it's stopped being functional, which sucks... but it's time to look at working out how to make that pain go away instead of just covering it up.

Meh...Couple hours passed and I felt better...thought nothing of it except where do I keep the rest of this? Bought a pill container, i think it was actually a flint container or something so it wasn't obvious. That was really my first ""stimulant"" use, I never felt anything before besides being drunk out of my mind a few times. So it was kinda exciting I could take a pill, get a little effect and just keep on living like nothing?

I've been self-medicating with over counter codeine (Solpadeine) since I had open heart surgery in 2003 aged 16. They helped with the PTSD I was left with after such invasive surgery. Depression and anxiety followed and took over my life. I met my partner in 2009 and we married in 2016. My use since then had become an addiction which I never shared fully and I have been heavily taking them for I would say the last two years.

We sadly suffered a miscarriage last year following 3 years on a fertility program. My wife has had enough of the anger and mood swings which the drugs leave me with and has said her love for me has changed. In an attempt to get honest at last I told her the truth what I was abusing myself with and I have for the last 3 days been back living with my Mum to give her some space.

I've not dealt with the miscarriage and we have not had face to conversation about it and the grief and loss we have experienced and how we have changed.

I deeply love my wife and the contact since I left has been her feelings have changed and I should not hold onto any hope of a reconciliation.

She did visit my GP with me on Saturday where it all came out and I start addiction therapy tomorrow where I hope I can also explore other aspects of my mental health. My desire for change to become the person she fell in love with is so strong and I just pray for her to see this and help me on my journey.

I know she is so angry at me but I can't see a future without her in. I'm not sure what I hope to achieve with this ramble of thoughts but I need to put it out there for comments and the hope I desperately need that others have survived such things.

I snort up to 2-3 little lines a day. I also take kratom everyday and have been for about a year in a half now. 
I don’t use one or the other to numb myself or my emotions. 
I don’t do it to get through life bc I feel it’s difficult. 
I actually have a pretty good life. I have a really good job, as I am a work horse that dedicates everything within myself to contributing to making my business better in healthy, responsible ways. I’m like that off drugs too so it’s not that. The drugs do not interfere w my job in any negative way, in fact I work around a lot of people that I can tell are on drugs and it affects them in negative ways like someone always having to compensate because of it or their dependability becomes almost non existent. I am reliable, dependable, and work within the parameters of getting the job done correctly and efficiently. I have an incredible person I share my life with. We’ve been living together for almost a year now and we live in a beautiful beach town in a condo on the beach. Might I add that we work together as well. Him and I are basically a consult team for restaurants in need of help and we work very well together. He doesn’t know I do this stuff. Infact, nobody knows I do it except the person I get it from. I am a VERY VERY private drug addict and I truly only use this stuff to create maybe a little “get up and go” for me when it’s time to clean the condo as I’ve always associated drugs with cleaning it’s one of my FAVORITEST things to do and I also use it to curb my appetite bc if I eat throughout the day, I will become lethargic and lazy and I got shit to do. Plus when I eat more than I do now I gain 20-25lbs and I’m really not meant to be at that kind of weight so, when my appetite is curbed it truly keeps me at a healthy weight, not feeling uncomfortable with that tire around my body. 

I don’t look anorexic I don’t “tweak” out and pick at my skin or have any other “tweak” habits. I eat at night pretty healthy eats and I legitimately also sleep every single night. 
This stuff makes me so normal that NO ONE suspects ANYTHING not even my boyfriend who is around me most of everyday. It’s not something I’m proud of in any sense so please don’t think that, I just use it in such an “innocent” manner that I don’t feel guilty that I have this secret. I have severe ADHD (yes, as an adult) and this stuff mellows me out and helps me concentrate as well and I’m actually very high strung off of it. 

I take care of myself, I bathe, I brush my teeth multiple times a day. I even, every two days or so, clean my nostrils w q tips and hydrogen peroxide. I am so “ on pointly normal” w this stuff it’s scary. 3 years ago, I spent the previous decade in a downward spiral of depression and drug addiction as I was addicted to opiates then eventually shooting up heroin. I was so lost and miserable that I relied on drugs to cope and deal with life until I slowly but surely lost every single thing I had. I ended up waking up right before it was too late, and got help and sober. I had loved life sober and only started dabbling eventually w meth to help w my ADHD, curbing my appetite, and making things like cleaning the house fun. That self destructive life I lived before is not appealing in any way that would have me go down that road again of using other drugs. I am comfortable w myself. I’m happy w myself. I love and accept myself and have a beautiful perspective on life that I truly don’t feel i could go down that path again despite using the small amounts of ice that I currently am now.
So, my question to you is, how do I get off it when i use it in like, the most innocent “healthiest” type of way? I want off this stuff!! I do 2-3 little lines day and I also take kratom. I barely take enough of this stuff to have withdrawals But I do and it’s NOT the just “eating and sleeping for a couple days” type withdrawals, I sleep on this stuff legitimately every night and when I don’t use it will actually mess with me sleeping BUT it’s also like there is other stuff in meth now bc every time I try to stop I have like very light, yet uncomfortable “opiate” type like withdrawals and I CANNOT tolerate feeling shitty in any sense I have such a busy life, I have to keep moving..And please, people, keep in mind that I have no reason to lie or fabricate anything I’ve said here nor am I in denial. I’m looking for honest, real results in asking y’all how I kick this, that I’ve given you guys the absolute truth. 
I have big important things coming up that I cannot afford to possibly have any illegal substance within my body. 

I HAVE TO AND NEED TO DO THIS ON MY OWN I KNOW FOR A FACT I CAN
just askin y’all if you have any tips bc this is not a typical “addiction” situation but, I acknowledge that it is an addiction nonetheless

2020-01-13 21:18:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/eoemtj/the_mind_of_an_addict_feedback/,The Mind of an Addict- Feedback?,"I'm a recovering addict and have recently rediscovered my passion for writing have been coming up with some random writings...I'm also self-conscious and unsure of my writing, but would like feedback! Lol feedback can be either about the subject or the writing itself...kthx guys <3 

 ****** 

The mind of an addict…Let me start off by saying, more is always more and for true addicts, more is never enough. We don't always understand why and in fact we are left more baffled and frustrated than even those who love us. It's a tricky thing- loving an addict. Often times, people can see the flickering light within us that we ourselves have lost sight of. In truth, the love from others can be the only thing keeping us from jumping fully off the cliff; sometimes, in the most tragic of happenings for any addict, it isn't enough. 

You see, there tends to be this preconceived notion that we intentionally want to bring others harm and honestly, that is very rarely the case. We are a hurting group of people trying to make life a little bit more bearable for even just a few hours...minutes, even seconds. Our addictions, regardless of our drug of choice, tend to become our happy-joy medication. You rarely hear an addict in the midst of full-blown addiction actually enjoying their drunk or high, rather we use simply to feel normal. Not facing crippling anxiety, deep depression, suicidal idealizations or being dope-sick...that becomes the goal. 

Somehow in life's process, we missed the bus when it comes to coping skills or managing either our psychological or physiological pain; Happiness in general becomes such a foreign concept. For me, I never understood even the most basic concepts of happiness. I never could understand or wrap my head around why people actually wanted to live. To me, life was a punishment that I tired of being subjected to. I wanted to die, plain and simple. I had no dreams or goals and the brief moments of satisfaction I did find were when I had a bottle, pill or needle in hand. What's worse, I had been convinced that that's how the rest of my life would be. 

Somehow in the chaotic mess that was my existence, there were those who continued to stand by me. It took the unconditional love of people who knew me -who really knew me- that saw past the tough, wall of a facade that was my only way of truly protecting me. Through all of the trauma that I had endured throughout my lifetime, it was recognized by loving and open-minded people that I sought only to nurse my wounds, fooling even myself that it was something I enjoyed…something that I needed, convincing myself I was having fun. None of these things were even remotely true and it was the resiliency in their efforts to love me through the nightmare I found myself in that finally broke through and touched my soul. I am one of the fortunate ones. 

Unfortunately, the depths of our addictions take us to often lead to bridges burned beyond repair. Then, the guilt and shame stemming from our mangled, devastated relationships fuel our need to numb out and punish ourselves, driving us to use again and again- anything to escape the pain of how truly fucked we've become. Surely, to most, it sounds like madness. Why else would we be drawn into such an obsession that we would praise our drugs from the mountain tops, even as we tumble from the peak? Broken and bruised, bloodied- forever finding ourselves baffled by the unrelenting, inexplicable and all-consuming desire to seek out our addictions time and time again. 

No one wakes up wanting to be an addict. It's not a ""step-up"" ambition of any kind; it is a fall. A fall we come to love simply because it's what we know and what we eventually come to feel that we deserve. 

Even once the drink and drug leaves our system and we are no longer physically dependent on them, there's still the mess between our ears that we must face. And really, we're all dealing with that very same mess in some way; drug addictions may not even be your vice. Maybe it's relationships you seek out, finding yourself co-dependent with the wrong person over and over. Maybe it's food that brings you comfort when stress seems to wear you thin and you just need some kind of relief. 

Or, you're one of the millions of people suffering from depression and other mental illness that warp your mind into believing terrible things about yourself and the world around you. Mental health does not discriminate, nor does addiction. The varying demographics of either or make clear several pertinent ideas: 

1. We are all trudging through life, some moving faster and others moving more slowly.

2. We are all striving for an acceptable level of happiness and a satisfying quality of life.

3. We don't always have a clue as to what the hell we're doing and we're figuring life out one day, one experience at a time.

We are not bad people- or at least we don't intend to be. Of course selfish intent can be found in anything and especially in active addiction, we are a sick people. However, it is in these moments of pain and struggle that we find the gratifying opportunity of change and the long lost hope for which we've sorely been lacking, and desperately searching. But above all else, we are a strong people. There is a daily battle that each and every person in this world must face in their own way and though we're often completely ignorant of the very strength of our fortitude, we strive to rise and meet each day with humility and gratitude.

We must learn to rely on hope and reckless optimism, brazenly fighting to be better than we were yesterday, all the while cherishing each sober breath we draw. Each aesthetic moment of genuine hope pulls us a little further away from the toxicity of our own self-hatred and brings us closer to the chance at living a quality of life that's only ever existed in our dreams. By making amends to those we have harmed, as well as ourselves, we are able to grow and transition from a life of bland existence to truly thriving among passions. 

We are fortunate in terms of insight and can see our fellows who may stumble across our paths- those who have come to know their own personal sufferings. In our pain, we gain the ability to empathize with the hurting and offer them acceptance, love and a hope that is recognizable by our own triumphs.

Today I understand that through the perspective of compassion and kindness, i can find intimate connections with family, friends, strangers, and to other human beings i do not know because I understand that we are all connected in someway. Today I understand that love is the transformative force that can bring everything together and heal my soul. 

But also today, i still search for meaning and purpose. Today i still struggle with living compassionately. And today, i still struggle how to live with love. Life is forever changing, and sometimes it changes make you look back to learn how to move forward. Life makes us question what we know today so we can change once again to move forward with it. Sometimes we fear the signs and fear holds life back. Life also brings us new answers to questions we forgot to ask or answers we were afraid to learn. And sometimes life gives you a gift. 

Today life is hard. Today love is hard. Today acting compassionately is difficult. Today i accept that it is and that there is a lesson for me to seek, to understand what is unfolding in front of me so i can move forward in the direction toward something transformative. Today is a hard day and I understand that sometimes finding happiness doesn't always mean it will bring you pleasure. 
For me, addiction is about finding meaning, finding purpose, finding love, learning how to live through life's struggles. Learning not through a script, learning without set rules or steps or structure but learning through taking a look at life through a critically spiritual process through the perspective of compassion. Learning collectively with others to find answers to your life's unanswered questions. Learning together creatively to transform our individual lives as we discover it. 

The past 8 years I've lived through the perspective of compassion as being the guide to every thought and action which has transformed me into the person i hoped to be in many ways. A person who i can look and see in the mirror most days with love. What ive learned is that compassion is what connects us to each other and the world. It is through compassion that creates the intimate relationships we need to feel connected, to not feel alone, to be understood, to be seen. And addiction is the loss of deeper connection to ones self and to all the relationships we have and seek. During my recovery i have also tried to understand Love’s meaning, purpose, and how it relates to my life and experiences. I practiced love in the way i believe was right for me. Learning from different perspectives and through others experiences that helped me get to a place where others close to me could heal from the damage I've done. And it has helped me also help others to heal by sharing knowledge that i have learned and by sharing my experiences. But love is hard to understand. Love still keeps me questioning, guessing, and especially when it comes to my needs. Not a desire or attachment but a requirement to my soul. I thought i could live without a certain type of love in my life but i was mislead by holding on to shame. 

Now, a better version of myself has appeared but I understand that life always changes and grows. And what we know yesterday doesn't always hold truth to today or tomorrow. That answers to ourselves is transformative through time, experiences and through people who we encounter along the way. Don’t be afraid to grow to change because without change we cannot grow.",7,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.992264986038208}"

I miss you fucking much. The beginning of our relationship was wonderful. I hit the jackpot! A man that cares, helps around the house, makes sure I am ok, and most of all... the first time we kissed I felt a shift in my soul. I knew in that moment you would be the man I spent the rest of my life with. I fell madly in love with you and you fell madly in love with me.

Then it happened. Your worst fear. You relapsed. 

Three days ago I dropped you off at a walk in for mental health and addiction counseling. I begged you to get help. You kept apologizing to me, telling me how you dont want to live like this and how you love me and cant lose me. I looked you in the eyes and said, ""No offense, but I've heard this time and time again and it just doesnt mean anything anymore."" 

I'm sorry. I should have said something kinder. I know you are struggling so hard and I know you want to beat this. I was so hurt, I am so hurt. I was selfish.

Last night you told me you went to the clinic for the second day in a row and that you plan to go regularly. I am so happy to hear this. I believe in you, and I will never give up hope that you will recover. I was so happy you answered your phone, it's like you are high all day and don't look at it at all. I asked you to come over last night. you delayed leaving, and delayed leaving. Then promised you were leaving within five minutes. I waited up for you until 3 in the morning. You never showed. To be honest, I knew deep down you wouldn't.

I was so disappointed when I woke up. I immediately text you about it this morning, you had excuses.

One thing that stuck out to me was when you said, ""I know this is hard.""

It has filled me with rage, sadness, and made me feel empty all at once. 

What the fuck is so hard for you? You only worry about catching your next high. Do you know what I worry about? Are you safe? Are you cold? Have you eaten? Are you in the back of an ambulance, again? Are you in jail? Are you alive? Are you having another seizure from this shit?

I feel so selfish. I know this is hard for you, of course it is, but I feel abandoned. Discarded. Unwanted. I am so in love with you and you told me you felt the same, I can still hear it in your voice on the rare occasion you answer the phone. I can't do this. I'm so tired of being afraid for you. I am emotionally exhausted. I don't know how much longer I can try support you.

Should I give up? Should I just accept that I am not enough? Fuck, when youre sober enough I hear the pain in your voice, the frustration, the wanting for things to go back to the way they were just a few short weeks ago. This addiction consumed you so fast. It came in to our lives and wrecked everything. 

I'm so sorry, T. I will never give up hope that you will get clean, but I can't do this much longer. This is killing me, too. Rehab is too expensive, I know. Half way houses are too expensive, I know. I wish I could save you like you saved me.

Please find a way to come back to me, to your family. Your mom is a wreck, too, and we both know you are avoiding her out of shame. I know you can do this! 

Please, keep fighting!

I have no idea what to do.,"I'm 25 and about a year ago I moved to the same city as my dad (53). I've tried to deny it as long as possible, but I keep picking up on things that lead me to believe he's definitely relapsed and I'm not sure what to do.

\[Backstory\] Working in finance, my dad was surrounded by and struggled with cocaine in the late 80s and 90s. My parents divorced in 1999 when I was 5 due to his addiction. He struggled for a few years on his own, moved to New York City around 2007 and finally got clean somewhere around 2009. After moving, he remarried, and had two kids. I had difficulty understanding why someone of his age would want to have two small kids instead of just enjoying life with his new wife and looking forward to retirement in 15 years. I reconciled it by telling myself that this was his way of starting his life over now that he was clean. 

\[Today\] He's lost both of his last two jobs (lay offs) and is currently unemployed. I can't help but notice that almost every time we're together he tries to covertly text strange numbers (i.e. a contact disguised as ""275-10""). He'll delete the text messages almost immediately after sending or receiving. He has been  increasingly impatient and irritable each time I see him and he doesn't look well rested. In fact, I find that if we go out to dinner, he'll have energy at the start, but by the end of the meal his eyes will be literally closing. Whenever I go over to his house he ends up falling asleep on the couch. I find his behavior quite uncomfortable to be around because I know deep down that he's relapsed. 

A few weeks ago me and my girlfriend went out to dinner with him. He was visibly tired, talked with food in his mouth, blew his nose into the napkin, and spoke so loudly that it seemed he had no care for anybody else in the restaurant. When the food came, he decided he didn't want the side salad that was on his plate, so he picked it up with his hands and put it on the other side of the table. I was MORTIFIED by his behavior. In fact, I left the table in the middle of the meal to go to the bathroom so I could take some deep breaths alone. I was hoping that my girlfriend didn't notice how obnoxious he was being, but when we got home she asked me ""did your dad seem okay to you?"" To me, that was pretty much confirmation that he's just not okay — not sober.

Looking for advice.","Hey guys, I feel comfortable posting here since its somewhat anonymous... My best friend of 4 years has had a rocky past when it comes to life in general, she has major rapid cycling depression which she always stays on top of (she has some of the best health coverage due to her moms occupation so she gets a lot of help managing her illness which she takes 100 percent advantage of something I am proud of her for because ive known many with the same bipolar disorder who didnt manage it at all or self managed in some way) anyways she told me once a long time ago that when she was in highschool she started smoking heroin, she said she got clean and only time she slipped up was one time and she realised why and stopped. Okay so fast forward 2 years (we had a big fight and we weren't talking for about a year) she came into my boyfriends work one night with her 45 year old boyfriend (she is 25 this year) she had been trying to contact me but I had her blocked and friends on automatic response when she asked to say they didnt know. She came in to try and get him to talk to me amd convince me to listen to what she had to say. He texts me and tells me she is at his work and i blow it off, then he gets home and we start talking about it and he says ""you should have seen her, she didn't look good she is frail, thin, has major bags under her eyes, and just all around seems to not be in a good place"" she has never been overweight but id say she was a healthy plump, with curves and everything that comes with, but she was wearing her 12 year old sisters pants because she was so thin. I took the next week deciding weather to contact her and ended on deciding I needed to make sure she was okay. I was worried if anything it could be an eating disorder since I know she was always complaining that she needed to lose weight even though she was beautiful and really didn't need to lose any. I'm rambling but this was about 4 months ago and now I'm noticing her current living situation is people with enough money to spend on things like prescription opiates which one of them has been frequently supplying her she says ""its no biggie cos if I wanted I could go and ask for them to perscribe it because its used for bipolar"" which seems good on the surface but knowing that she never pays for Dr visits or prescriptions or even her gas (gets a gas card supplied by her boss to fill her tank) why wouldn't she just go and get her own prescription? Then she starts talking about how she has to stop smoking weed so shes excited to start using sssyrup instead she says ""its like purple drank and I LOVE purple drank have you ever tried it?"" I said no and I repeated what i have told her before that I don't put that kind of stuff in my body because I don't like the risk of addiction she blew it off saying that it was good and that her roommates have it all the time and have been sharing it with her. I don't know if I'm being crazy or not here but it seems to me if she isnt already back in the clutches of a dangerous addiction she is heading straight there. She's been gaining weight again since I've been forcing her to eat and encouraging a normal sleep schedule and regular walks but she seems all around very frazzled she cant stay focused on one thing for longer than 2 to 3 minutes, she has an increasingly worse memory problem and has been in more car accidents in the last 2 years than most people in their whole lives and go figure none of them were her fault. Maybe I'm worrying too much or over thinking but if anyone has had any experience with this I would really appreciate insight.

In doing so we are avoiding pain, especially emotional pain. Indeed as emotional pain magnifies physical pain, the latter would be handled, accepted and eventually treated if we were in a state of pure consciousness: just raw presence without any reactions. So healing the root of emotional pain is the key. 

The universal solution is thus:  deeply facing ourselves. This entails facing our emotional pain with the power of Love and meditative presence.

The most important point to understand here is that our deepest self is immensely intelligent and beautiful, there is nothing to fear: even our pain is the expression of a very deep and beautiful intelligence, the embodiment of the Divine itself.

  We are scared of our darkness because we believe it is evil but in truth it hides the most stunning jewel in the universe: our true heart. 

We also have to understand that meditative pure presence itself is a miraculous medicine of the highest kind: when it is applied to emotional pain it will magically transmute it into bliss. That's right the truth is an alchemical one: transmuting darkness into light. This means that pain cannot be disgarded, it is an innate part of yourself and with knowledge it becomes the precious raw fuel that will get transformed into pure blissful love. 

As we identify with pain, we run away from it: that's why it's liberating to realise that we are already beyond it so it is deeply okay to observe it attentively, it will not kill us. 

Then finally, once pain has been acknowledged it leaves you forever.

In the end it was all about sitting with ourselves, with no distractions in the presence of Love. But in this modern world everyone is afraid to do that, even regular people who don't use drugs. All our lifes we are running away from ourselves through hyperactivity: jobs, drugs, hobbies, distractions, etc...

It may sound like a fairytale but this enlightened higher love is real. Many masters have praised it since ancient times.

Now shamanic plant medicines are also showing us that this shadow work was the real key all along.  

For instance Iboga, the miracle plant that cures heavy addictions.  I have taken it...not for addictions but for emotional pain. It put me through very hard work, but I patiently carried on until the end because I knew that there was something beautiful on the other side of all this darkness I needed to face. I eventually found out. Yes, it was Love all along. It is true:  All is Love. 

Darkness can be faced progressively in your day to day life or in an accelerated way through shadow work and plant medicines. Our choice.

I grew up in a conservative and religious small town. I had a lot of presumptions about the drug. But then my friends were in the car and one of them took out a pen. It happened slowly. I tried it once and was fine without it for months. My first experience was very positive. I had a lot of fun with my friends and never felt more happy and at peace with the world. Then I tried it a few more times. Then somehow I ended up buying some. But I rarely touched it at first. Maybe once or twice a month. Slowly I just kept doing it more and more often.  During the summer 2019 I attempted suicide and began smoking on a daily basis to cope with the depression. Every night I slept feeling disgusting and every morning I woke up feeling disgusting. I started to notice wrinkles on my face. 

My younger brother (19) said he could tell when I was high because I wasn’t angry. It made me realize what I was hiding underneath. I thought I was helping myself by using weed to deal with my anger and sadness. The truth is whenever I let myself get sober the baggage was still there. 

Once the school semester began I thought I would slow down. But I didn’t. I began smoking earlier and earlier in the day. I was high in class. I was high in lab. I’d go to my car and smoke in between classes. My voice began to sound raspy and I did poorly in school. It was my last semester in undergrad and I spent it faded as hell. I tried going to therapy, but I thought my habit was more effective treatment lol. 

I kept going until I couldn’t anymore. I smoked and took 30mg edibles a day and barely felt any difference. It would take more and more and more weed to feel baseline moods. I don’t blame the marijuana to be honest, I was clearly trying to run away from the reality of my life. 

I spent hundreds on it. Money I could have used to help others. It could have contributed to my tuition. I could have paid for new tires for my dads car. I could have bought my brother the laptop he always wanted. I could have invested it into the stock market. But no, I threw it away on poison. 

I don’t know what damage it’s done to my body at this point. But the daily use for the past six months has been affecting my conscious. My family is against weed and I know if they caught me I’d be in trouble. For so long I just said I’d never get caught, but the guilt and stress of hiding it made me feel more shitty. 

I’m writing all of this now to warn people. Look if you’re a vulnerable person like me it isn’t a good idea to just try things once. I couldn’t have been more against weed to begin with. It’s funny because my friends didn’t even pressure me to try it, I just let my curiosity take over. 

It has officially been two days without smoking and I unadded my dealer on all social media. I’ve tried to quit before, but this time it is so much different. I don’t want weed anymore. I don’t want to be high. I don’t want to destroy my body. I don’t want to waste my money. But most of all, I just don’t want to be angry.

The first time I got high was with this guy named Tim. Our realtionship was sex, weed and well more fucking sex. But God damn the weed was good. I was high through that summer and honestly  cared less. It was beginning and end, I didn't care that it was destroying me. I didn't want to face reality. 

Tim was also a drug addict who was 4 years sober from heroine and crack addiction. He actually needed weed to help his brain cope. 

Were we toxic together? I don't know. 

How old was he? Well I think he would be 25 ish now. I'm 21. He was 19 when I was 16.

I didn't know your last name, you had glasses, and where rail thin. No matter how I tried to feed you. You had blonde hair and scar marks. And you where my addiction. If i could find you again. I want to make things right. Start over and just be friends. 

I haven't forgotten you. But something in me wants you to see the impact you made on me all those times pouring my heart and soul out. You are my first ever fucked up love. I may have been high as a kite Every time. But you gave me something more inside. Even if it was toxic. 

The last time I saw you was a few months before you I left for a new life. I was in no way a good person. 

I was in my darkest times of my addiction and you where there with me.

Mostly I hold to these memories now. And even to my own hold of things I'm not sure how to say.

To my rapist in the shitty dark months. Fuck you. You went off rumors and not facts. 

I was too fucking depressed and wanted to die. So I tried one night taking three of my mother's heart pills and woke up groggy.

I am trying to help them get clean, and healthy without enabling them but I am having a hard time figuring out where to draw the line. 

Little bit of background: I have known them since we were kids. They have always struggled with extreme anxiety and chronic depression. Their substance abuse issues have developed as unhealthy coping mechanisms. I have tried to encourage them to seek treatment but they have been unwilling until now to do anything but self medicate. They know they are an alcoholic but have continued to drink. They constantly have smoked weed since college. That progressed to cocaine abuse. 

They finally saw the damage that cocaine had done to themselves and their relationships (including our friendship) and managed to make it nearly a year without using again. However, they continued to smoke and drink. I hoped it would last but everything I read said that most addicts need to quit all substances or risk relapse. 

I wasn't able to visit or see them for a few months. I was struggling too and we fell out of contact for a while. I talked to them right after Christmas and they said they were really depressed again. Their anxiety had flared up too and they weren't able to do everyday tasks. They sounded serious when they said that they needed and wanted professional help. I agreed to come help them sort out some of the everyday stuff (cleaning, shopping, etc.) and help them find a therapist. They admitted that they probably would have killed themselves if I hadn't. 

I suspected that they were using again. When I saw them, they were so underweight that it looked like they had starved. They barely eat, or sleep. 

Present Day: They admitted they are using again. They said they want to stop but are afraid that they won't be able to keep their life together if they do. I hate the idea of  them continuing to use. I don't want to be around it. They also admitted that they live with people who also use. 

I don't want to make them feel bad about struggling or feel like they can't confide in people.  I think if I tried to get them to stop right now that they will clam up and won't get any help at all. It seems like they are wavering between wanting help and being able to still use. I also realize that they may have to solve one problem at a time and seeking help for their mental health issues may help them recover from substance abuse. 

How should I handle this? What boundaries can I put in place to make sure they aren't taking advantage of me and that I am not enabling them while still helping my friend? I want to help them feel less anxious by taking care of the everyday stuff so they can focus on finding the energy for therapy but I am afraid that if things get better they will dismiss how serious their mental health and addiction issues are.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981997013092041}"

The world fights against you, Normalizing the infedility of your heart. Rationalizing the cause of your moral ambiguity. 

Everyone else does it, so it's okay right? It is an invisible burden, making the struggle worsen. Admitting your addiction would admit that your are less than a man, especially to a society that sees no wrong, no reason why it would cause inner turmoil. 

This disease will rot your mind, blind your eyes. You will find yourself looking outside and being disgusted by what you see, unrecognizable. The empty promise of ""one more time"" will be your daily routine. 

Like a preparation to justify why you can't stop yourself. Your hands will move of their own accord, like a waking dream. Your inner mind yells ""stop"" but only a sinister laugh echos back. 

The constant urge consumes you. At work, at play. ""Scratch me"" whispers the itch and you are powerless to resist. It promises to leave only to return moments later. 

You watch as the seconds tick by. Pacing back and forth, back and forth, searching for a reason to trick yourself into thinking it's okay. These excuses bind you.

2020-01-09 11:53:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/emccr7/a_my_perspective_on_addiction/,A (My) Perspective on Addiction,"
Overcoming addiction was the most difficult challenge i have faced and doing so i had to focus on its roots, my suffering and disconnect. For many of us, if not all, our pain and suffering began before our addiction even started. And so developing a better understanding of ourselves and embracing the right perspective where compassion, truth and forgiveness are present is essential in facing out fear, understanding guilt, so it can be transformed to empower change. 

It is our detachment or disconnect from our psyche (the human soul, mind or spirit) that has or help some of us survive a traumatic event, and turned to behaviours like seen in addiction to cope. Substances to relieve us from pain, an unhealthy attachment for the need to be love and to love, our unhealthy relationship with food and our body,  or the need to accumule material things and money, just to name a few.  And for some, we also took on personality traits that led to personality disorders. These personalities are not our character but coping mechanisms to perhaps shield us from reality of trauma.  And for others, the trauma they endure is a crisis of reality because they are born into it. They say money cannot buy happiness, i beg to differ because not having it brings a tremendous amount of suffering. The constant stress of putting food on the table, paying bills, paying for school, clothes, just basic needs for yourself or kids is needless suffering. 

When dealing with guilt from our addiction, yes we must take ownership for our part so we can change, but own onlt what is ours to own. Ownership is not self blame but the search for reason for the ability to choose better. And there are many contributing factors that is not yours to own. We live in a social ill ideological society that puts Politics, Power and Profits over the social needs of its people. Where inequality is much greater than the value of equality. This plays a big part in our suffering because it feeds to our insecurities of our self image and says we are never enough. That we always need more or to be more in a way that contradicts the true meaning of happiness. 

With undertanding, its in that moment we must own what is ours because that is the moment when we become empowered to choose to change. But do not own the shit that society gives you that contributes to stress, anxiety, depression that leads to the need for escape. And do not feel bad, It is natural for you to think about escaping the reality of your suffering. 

Addiction is complicated and complex. It biological, psychology, social and spiritual.
I do not presume to know your path but what i do know is that addiction is the absence of connection and at times the distortion of love, compassion and kindness. And that the pursuit of happiness must include love in order to re-connect with your psyche and to find meaningful connections with others. Without Self Love and Love for Others, true happiness will always feel and be out of your reach. Love is always the way forward.",9,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9822523593902588}"

Furthermore, he has an addiction to porn which I didn't understand the severity of until recently as well.

After some serious discussions and reflection, my boyfriend admitted to me (and to himself) that he thinks he may have a sex addiction.  He suspects it may stem from his adolescence and watching his dad and brother objectify women as well as the general objectification of women in traditional and social media.  He goes further to say that it's difficult for a straight male in this day and age when sex and sexuality are thrown in your face (which is fair).

Anyway, for the time being we have separated for obvious reasons but also to take time to heal.  I have trust and self esteem issues I need to work through, and he has his addiction which he has to address and treat.

I got in a car accident 9 years ago and shattered my pelvis and broke my hip. I was in the hospital for a few months and then had to re-learn to walk, do physical therapy, the whole usual ordeal. That accident brings me to where I am now, 9 years later, addicted to opioids. I have basically taken them off and on, mostly on, since that accident. There has been A LOT that has gone in these last 9 years but it would take a book to explain it all, so Ill just talk about the last 3-4 years.

Before the accident, I had never taken any kind of pill other then tylenol/advil so Id say most of my current issues stem from within the past 9 years. Anyways, Ive been prescribed 3-4 10/325 oxycodones/day for the past couple years. I used to take them how they were prescribed and to be honest, I dont even know how/when I got this bad off. But for the past couple years, I would get my prescription and instead of taking 4/day, I would take 6-8/day. I never took two at a time but instead of taking them every 4-6 hours, I would take one every two hours, give or take 30 mins. Meaning I would usually run out almost two weeks early. 

So for the next two weeks I would trade my adderall for someone I knows hydrocodone. The hydrocodone didnt help my like the oxycodone did, but I felt like it helped enough that I wouldnt go into full withdrawals if that makes sense. Also note, I couldnt get an unlimited supply of hydrocodone or anything, I normally got enough of the 10mg hydros to take only 2-3/day, so I definitely had to somewhat control myself during that time. I never bought anything off the street or tried anything else. However, every month I told myself, Im going to take my meds the way Im supposed to take them, I HATED always worrying about pills...if I had them, would I be able to get them, how many could I get, etc. Which brings me back to how it literally CONSUMED me. Always in the back of my mind though was the actual, REAL pain I have in my lower back. Without pain meds, how would that be controlled?? Mind you Ive tried 3-4 different type of injections, physical therapy, non narcotics, etc. because at the end of the day I just dont want to be in this kinda pain but again, at the same time these pain pills have completely changed me as a person. Wheres the balance?! 

For the past couple months, I have been thinking REALLY hard about how I want to end this cycle but Ive never been strong enough to do it, until yesterday. I went to my pain management doctor and did the usual spiel and finally broke down and told him I want to get off the pills. He agreed with me, I could tell for the past few months he wanted me off the narcotics  (which only added to my stress and anxiety..when would the time come that he would just stop prescribing them?? These are things that constantly ran through my head) but I was kind of passed to him from my other doctor who moved away and I guess since I had always complied and also tried several other things to try and help the pain, he never took them away. So he prescribed me like 5 other meds to help with the withdrawals and also called a personal doctor friend who works on the addiction side, as he said, who would be able to help with my dependency (addiction? I loathe that word). So the last pain pill I took was half of a 10mg hydrocodone at 8:30pm Monday night. (I took 3 10mg altogether that day) I went and got the meds he prescribed filled, although my pharmacy was out of two of them and they had to order them, hopefully they will come in today. Anyways, after that I went to work like normal and was actually not to bad off, minus my crying like a baby on and off while I texted my mom and dad about whats going on. I know my mom had some idea of how bad I was but my dad, who lives 3 hours away, had no clue. None of my friends know about this nor does any of the rest of my family including my siblings and step parents. Its mortifying and I dont want anyone else to know about it to be quite honest. 

So back to my main story, sorry I like to ramble. So my pain management doctors, doctor friend who works the “other side” of this, had his office call me within an hour of me leaving my doctors appt. She said the doctor could get me in Thursday morning (tomorrow) and asked the basic questions about insurance and stuff. I do have insurance but of course its one of the only ones that doctor doesnt accept, so my first appt will be $400 bc she said its a longer appt and I asked what all it entails. She said basically he will talk to me and find out what my issues are and most likely prescribe me suboxone, just ONE, that I will have to take and get filled at the pharmacy, bring back to the doctors office and take half in front of him? Then wait around so he can see and make sure I dont have any negative side effects and then Ill be able to leave. She didnt say anything more so I am guessing if the suboxone agrees with me, I will be given a script for it for a month and then have to follow back up with him in a month. Does this sound likely what is to happen?

Aside from everything that happened with the doctors yesterday, here I am I guess about 36 hours after my last dose and I dont feel like Im dying or anything but I dont feel good either. I called into work this morning and Im also thinking about calling into my second job this afternoon, although I really need to be working. I feel tired more then anything, that and my back hurts. Im probably killing my liver with acetaminophen. Last night I was able to work almost my whole shift, I left two hours early because I just couldnt make myself work any longer. Im also having terrible anxiety. Ive had bad anxiety for years and used to be prescribed xanax, however, last year the doctors said there have been new studies done and they werent going to be prescribing pain meds and xanax anymore so I went off the xanax, which I never had an issue with that anyways. I only took it as needed, so not even everyday, it honestly wasnt hard to give up but holy fuck, I wish I had one right now. Im also just so so tired. I even took my adderall and Im still tired as shit. I have no motivation whatsoever, which I didnt have much while on the pills, not now it’s literally non existent. I know Ive read other peoples stories on different subs who sound like they’ve had it way worse than me and Im sure I sound like a big ass baby, Im just so pissed at myself for doing this to myself to begin with and now Im having a pity party.

So I guess my questions are, how much worse will this get before it starts to get better? How long until I feel normal again? What should I expect from taking suboxone? Is there anything I can do now (like right now, today) to feel better, cut down on the anxiety, whatever? Ive read on here about something called Kratom, should I try that? I first read about it on another sub a couple months ago and have been thinking about trying it since then but Im honestly kind of scared since I dont know how itll effect me. I also do not smoke or drink, tried weed in the past, years ago, not my thing.

Im looking forward to getting my LIFE back. The pills have completely changed me as a person. I used to be very social, had lots of friends, always on the go. Now, I dont do anything but work and lay on my couch. Im lazy as fuck, depressed as fuck and honestly probably wouldnt even leave the house if it wasnt for work and my dog. I rarely see my friends and when I do its because I have to force myself. Im just tried of living like this. Any help or advice is very much appreciated!!!!

We need to move from inside ourselves and into others.

It suddenly hit me, that it was time to make a radical change in my life.  At 7 o'clock in the morning, I reached out to my family and told them that I was struggling with substance abuse.  I had been smoking weed daily for over 20 years, and at various times had used opiates, benzos, amphetamines, and XTC. I went to an IOP class and then to an MRT class, all the while going to weekly therapy sessions.  In spite of my positive transformation, my wife did not come back, but I did get custody of our children when the divorce was finalized.  

There are times when I think about using, and let me tell you, I've had plenty of opportunities.  The bottom line is, I like who I am without the drugs.  I miss my wife and the relationship that we once had, but perhaps I needed to lose her in order to find myself.  So my story is a little bittersweet and that is life.

It feels like everything they try to learn me, could easily fit in one hour if I would be alone. I notice some in the group really like to talk 'bout themselves while I try to keep my answer short so that others also have a chance to speak. I zone out a lot, can't sit still and notice I'm really inpatient. I feel no connection with the group because they come from different enviourments and most are alcoholics, what had never been a problem for me. I understand a group like this can support me, but I already have a lot of support from my parents and friends. I'm not in the mood to hear extra drama and feels like it's bringing me down.

Ice is seriously nothing you want to get into it. It's fun in the beginning that 1 or 2 times, but when Tina gets ahold of you and digs her nails deep into you... you're addicted. I was the person who kept saying ""No, I have self control"".. my fiance introduced me to it and what was suppose to be a ONE night fun escapade has turned into a long, stressful, and very hard roller coaster of a year. Neither one of us are ourselves, we only hang out with people who do it, and it has tore us apart... he told me in the beginning that itll tear couples apart and I didnt believe him.. the lies, cheating, arguing... it all sucks so bad and hurts both of us. Outside family/friends dont officially know we do it, but I'm sure they have guessed. Not to mention, the shitty feeling of failing at being a parent at most.... 

I dont want to do this anymore.. I cant keep doing this anymore.. I want to be the best version of myself for not only myself but entirely for our son & fiance. I haven't been that woman in a long time now.. I don't have very many people I can talk to about this so it's all been bottled up. But if anything, please just send some positivity this way.

I pushed a finger into my leg. It gave, and then the little pocket that formed didn’t fill in like usual. It looked like when you make a little pocket in fresh dough. I had read about this before. It meant organ failure.

The reason I knew this was because I had been habitually doing the push test whenever I felt really off, and as it happens, one tends to feel off quite a lot when indulging in speedballs. So it came to pass that one day, while feeling so off I could barely lift my arms, I failed the push test.

I had just crashed my car, and instead of calling for help, I frantically worked to change my tire, as my car was the only way to Baltimore, the land of heroin and cocaine. This was usually a simple task for me. Loosen the lug nuts, jack the car up, finish loosening the lug nuts, switch to the spare, and tighten. Instead, I managed to loosen exactly one before collapsing next to the car. A passerby offered help, and on second glance decided against it. Can’t say I blame her. I looked like a zombie, as the officer I spoke to later that night informed me.

Ever since, I have not been able to go more than a day without smoking.  

The problem is, I believe it’s making my mental state even worse. For the past 4 months I’ve suspected that my marijuana usage has been intensifying my anxiety and depression, as well as making me lethargic, lazy, and generally unwell. My grades have dropped, I’m completely broke, I’ve been constantly asking my closest friends for loans, and I cannot find the drive to get out my bed and do something with my life. The worst part is I’m almost finished with high school  - a time where I’ve got to be at least a little clear headed. 

My usage also causes me lots of guilt, which only further worsens my mental state. It’s killing me, because no matter how guilty I feel, no matter how many times I tell myself to stop smoking, I cannot quit for the life of me. Even when I do make progress, such as learning to only smoke at night, it doesn’t seem to make a difference. 

At the moment, weed is literally the only fucking thing I care about. Nothing else. Its become my hobby and my crutch. It’s the only thing I can talk about, the only thing that will allow me to actually feel happy. 


So what the hell do I do? How do I go about quitting, or atleast decreasing my usage? I feel completely trapped.

Not sure how to grieve the right way, when no one seems to understand.","Hey everyone.

I've (25f) struggled with alcoholism for the past 3 years, and within the past almost 6 months found myself going through rehab. I've gotten out in the past 2 months, and been sober for 2 months except for 1 night of drinking shortly after I got out. 

A week after getting checked into rehab, someone else came in named S (40sM), and we instantly connected. He had been into rehab once before, and from the start we helped and supported each other. He was like my protector, goofy older brother, whom I could talk to about anything. Im sure others who have been through an in-patient rehab know the ""unusual friendship pairings"" I am talking about. We would have probably never talked/been such close friends had we not met in such an environment, but we did, and I don't believe I would have been able to have had the confidence or courage to be moving forward the way I am today had it not met him. We would go on an hour walk most everyday in the 2 hours we had between the days groups, and the nighttime dinner/meetings were we talked about everything we were going through. He had me laugh, and believed in me in a time when most of my other loved ones were at the end of their ropes. I loved him, and needed him, and knew the rest of my life he would be someone I could talk to and rely on whenever I needed him. And I would be that for him. I talk some time before I let people into my life in such a way, and he became part of my inner circle. 

We got out of rehab, and went into the same sober living community. Starting around Thanksgiving he started slowly drinking and using again. On Christmas day, he called me wanting to talk about it all, and talking about suicide(something he had longtime struggled with). He'd been drinking though, and was driving, and on the phone with him he got into a car accident, and started raging. He was okay, but after that I told him he had to start getting being true to himself/the program/whatever and until then, I had to put some distance because I couldn't support him while he was drinking. I loved him, would always be there, but he had to start going back to meetings, and stop drinking.

He went to a psych ward, got out, and when he called me said he understood, and wanted to get better. We talked 3 times the week after christmas and on New Years eve. I suspected he may be drinking, but it wasn't so ""bad"" that I called him out, and I was keeping it short anyway because of my suspicions. 

Well yesterday I learned that he was found dead in a hotel room. There was alcohol in the room, and pill bottles. No one really knows what happened. I had been ""preparing"" myself for this the past week after christmas day, but nothing could really prepare me for what is has been like. I have never experienced grief before, and having the added element of substance abuse makes things even harder. My family, and friends have been trying to be supportive, but its ""well he was very sick, this was going to happen"", ""there was nothing you can do"", ""you need to move on like he would have wanted you to"" ect. and thats all fine, but its been just about 24 hours, and I am just sad right now. I was with my other buddies from the rehab last night for dinner/a sleepover to be together and that was great. People that knew the funny, complicated person he was as I knew him. 

But I feel like I'm on a carousel of feelings, and I can't not think about him, and all the things leading up to his death, and our friendship. But most of my loved ones didn't know him, and don't get it. It's like I am expected to be ""fine"" and functioning, but there are points during the day when I just want to lay down in my bed, or go outside and listen to music or just cry and think about him. Already I am feeling judged for my parents, and its like the person I would want to above everyone else is him, and I am just tired. I feel battered.

I guess now I am just asking for advice for how I should be feeling or acting right now, or even comment stories. Its like its just been over 24 hours, and its really just starting to sink in for my that I will never hear this person laugh again, or have him say ""how are you doing kiddo?"", but I am being pushed by my parents to move on.

Typical, I held onto who I met- a person with much more enthusiasm for life.  We did things.  He took me to places I haven't seen and I did things I've never done- good things like ziplining and cliff diving.  

There were obvious issues with him from the get go, but I had my own issues and we fantasized about healing and growing together.  Of course things fell apart and back into addiction for both of us.  He was into heroin and pain killers.  I liked meth and tripping.  Circumstances and just general exhaustion, I stopped.  He started taking methadone.  I got a job, he kept one..things weren't good but they had potential.  

He just never stayed away for long.  He ended up making friends at the clinic to make new drug connections.  It started being all he ever talked about. He'd watch those shows almost obsessively, like Drugs Inc.  It was all he seemed to care about and live for.  Coupled with his erratic behavior and outbursts of violence, I reached a peak and called the police, kicked him out.

That was before Thanksgiving and I am forced to keep contact with him to some extent because I can't remove him from the lease right now.  I do genuinely care about him.  He wants to ""work things out"" but any time I've seen him, he was clearly high.  His pupils were tiny, he'd nod off while driving or standing, all he did was ""nap"", he'd ask me to borrow $10 or $20 constantly, which I am already getting help from my family.  He'd never fully pay me back so I don't give him money anymore so he asks me to buy him pop and chips or something since he claims he doesn't eat.  

He makes like 4 times as much as I do.  I'm not stupid.  I know where it goes but he of course says things like ""I bought some a while back, I'm rarely high"". ..His sister and mother called him out and now he's angry at them and feeling attacked, telling me like I'm going to give him a sympathetic ear.  I don't want to be an enabler.  I get that he's coping and running from whatever it is he could never deal with.  I managed to get him to agree to make an appointment for biofeedback therapy, asked for that day off to go with him and be moral support.

He's high so constantly he has no real concept of how much time has passed, conversations, or really even where we're at in life.  I don't consider us together and I've told him that but half the time I talk to him he nods off..but he's not high, just tired and drunk..is what he says.  

I guess I'm just looking for moral support or advice on how people deal with such situations..if you've ever successfully confronted or changed a friend that was addicted.  My brother was one too but it was different.  I could be blunt and sling harsh words and not be shut out or silenced the way my ex does to others.  He's at that point where the whole world could know and say he's high but he'd still deny it.  He's been homeless before so it's like that waiting for his rock bottom part.  Losing me wasn't enough.  Losing family relationships and friends wasn't enough, either.  Living in a crackhouse isn't doing it.  How do you deal when they're at this stage?  He texts me constantly in spurts and I ignore more than half of them because it won't matter anyway.  It would hurt to find out if he ever overdosed or just ended up in the gutter, living a sad life.  I know it's not my problem but I can't easily deny or move on from that heavy chemical connection when you've had a drug-based and dependent relationship.

&#x200B;

this is my first post here ever - I have been looking at reddit for years and lately been trying to get my life back together. To give you a short overview, I am in my twenties, good highschool diploma, top university business degree completed and with a consulting firm. So far my life for me appears to be entirely on track for everyone looking - I have money saved up, a loving girlfriend and family, great prospects for the future.

When I was younger I had a series of bad events and friends introduce me to consumption of various drugs and eventually nearly lost control of my life to the extent of being kicked out by my parents, losing almost all my friends and nearly fucking up high school - but managed to turn it around in the last second. I kind of quit - by saying kind of I mean i turned it into very, very occasional (1-2x / year) but started filling the gaps in between with other kinds of rushes. Be it nicotine, alcohol and in the past years also gambling (in the beginning with smaller amounts, lately with large sums). I managed to actually win quite a bit of money, then lost a portion of it again and decided to quit.

As soon as I did that I turned to drinking more and smoking more - when I try to stop I pick up something else again (even if it's ""just"" obsessive Gym going or something similar).

Due to having a few days off lately I have been thinking of how to fight this addictive personality of mine - how to kind of lose this circle of ALWAYS having to have some kind of external rush. I seem to be able to say ""NO"" to one thing just to replace it again straightaway.

Oh my god I just realized that I'm the devil, I'm a coke addict lying to my family, friends, ex-lovers, myself, and the rest of the world that I'm trying to get better. Yet in between the inhales of coke in one snort and the exhales of snot, I'm still looking for that missing piece.

I'm still searching the floor pathetically from the crumbs and desiring for more. I know how this came about, how I became a coke slinging mind numbing and thought bending construct. I started by destroying my sense of self, isolating through depression, and crippled with anxiety I tried to medicate my-self away and tried to keep walking forward until I would trip over it.

Because the dumbest thing in the world is to escape the inevitable, change. So I'm the fucking devil, I'm the one manifesting into these shitty futures by hiding in my room like a goblin. I'm the asshole who chose drugs over my girlfriend and then my boyfriend, and then my mother, and then my sisters, and then my friends.

I'm that dick and I refuse to take responsibility for my-self, I've been trying to get that thing away from me and when I stopped therapy I realized just how flawed and hopeless I am. I am so frighteningly self aware that I live with crippling anxiety that morphs into depression and became the face of my hopelessness in addiction. I've gotten better in some sense, I've only done a gram this week.

My all time high was 4g in 2 days and Perocet pills scattered throughout and filling the gaps with random psychedelics to reflect on my glory days. Well I have a message to deliver to you, you hurt yourself by never asking for help.

You die endlessly and pointlessly by wasting your time, everything you made is meaningless and if anything harmful to your well being. Why do you choose to live like this? Give me a fucking reason, or get out town tonight and get a job, go back to school and learn something this time, and if you don't do something then shut up.

""I saw all the signs but I didn't do anything, this was going to be a problem from the beginning. I wish I had better guides and tried to combine awareness with hope."" -God

I'm lying I'm not really god, because I did have good guides and awareness, I just didn't have hope. I want to get better and honestly for myself because I'm too much of a dumb shit to kill myself already so I might as well just try to live for myself for once. 

All this came to ahead when I tripped on acid last week and I had this weird moment where everyone in my life was looking straight at me but there eyes were darted away. Like they didn't want to look at me and I wanted to get angry that they weren't looking at me, no one was seeing my suffering. 

I was like a little kid threatening to die but slowly because she was too much a child to go through with it. When you see someone jump and almost hit the pavement, empathy makes you close your eyes at the last second. To spare you the trauma. 

God I can't believe I ever thought it was anyone else's fault, everyone I love tried to help me but I never wanted any of that. I am struggling constantly in a process of having faith in the cocaine and loneliness as a substitute for everything I've lost, 

""There's no going back now, the only way for me to continue is forward"" and ""I want to back and change everything I did wrong"" 

Neither of these are realistic conclusions on how to deal with life, I am hopefully going to start therapy again this month and try to find new habits to establish and learn to circumvent this cycle of depression-anxiety-hopelessness-drug abuse backflip justify everything rinse and repeat reflect what have I done!

I would be able to go a few days with using coke, feel fine, but then I would begin eating. I would look at my body and feel disgusted that I was bloated or feeling pudgy. I would then start using again so I wouldn't eat.

I’ve came to realize the *internet and world* is full of arrogant and unforgiving assholes. Who don’t deserve to know mine or for that matter anyone’s story... My only hope is that maybe this helps someone who’s also struggling, and if anyone needs someone to talk to message me. I’d love to share my full story, but not to everyone, as I tried to do that four days ago, and was met with the rudest, most arrogant comments I’ve ever heard in my life. Ill try and reply as quick as possible, but between work and this extreme fatigue please allow some time..} 

    1) I’m a 19 years old *M*, I’ve abused drugs in general for the better part of 6 years. 6 months ago I was introduced to crystal meth, and made the absolute worst decision of my entire life. 

    2) I snorted a line smaller than one inch, and from there went into a full blown addiction. I changed from the sweet guy I formally was, into someone I didn’t even know. I met people who was so mean, cruel, and heartless, people I never knew existed on this earth. 

   3) I *thought that meth made me a better person, A harder worker, and easier to get along with*. That is a total lie in which your brain is lying to you. My ROA changed from snorting, to oral, then to smoking, and finally slamming. By the time I reached IV, I was a goner... I see it so clearly now. 

   4) I’m so angry, really I’m just pissed at myself. The withdrawal has been brutal, but nothing can compare to the self-hatred I have right now. **I lost everything**, 4K in savings wiped clean, a brand new vehicle that I had busted my ass for gone. EVERYTHING I had formerly gone in 6 MONTHS. I BEG anyone who’s considering this drug to RUN, anyone who’s still on this drug PLEASE stop using and get help. 

   5) Last but not least..., the only thing that was able to pull my head out of my ass has been my newly found girlfriend. I’ve known her for 4 years before we decided to become something more than good friends. This girl is for lack of a better word a savior. She has stuck by my side helping me beat this drug, and for the last 4 days I’ve been absolutely sure she’s had to think I’m crazy. Yet she assures me I’m not, understands it’s the withdrawal causing my mood-swings, and she stays by my side. She has a daughter who’s only 5 months old. The father completely out of their lives. 

   6) My only hope is that I can be the best father this girl could ever dream of having. I’m just your regular 19 year old, yet when I look into the eyes of this baby... It gives me purpose again in life. If it wasn’t for these two coming into my life I’d still be nothing. Even though it’s only been four days, things in my life have changed so rapidly. I’ve applied / am applying for new careers, and am currently working daily in construction.’The future looks brighter everyday, and even though there’s moments I feel absolutely hopeless and just wanna give up, these two girls are the reason I keep pushing on. Work has been extremely hard on me, as I feel so fatigued I just want to sleep, yet I feel I must earn a paycheck to help care for her kid, my kid. 

{ So to wrap all this up, you can beat this drug. I know I will beat this drug, because even on my worst days. My two girls are the reason I keep going. I refuse to let her have a drug-addicted father. I’ll probably delete later, but Thanks for reading.}",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9975364208221436}"

Ignore it if you can. Smite me in your comment(s) if you want. 

Today, I had a bouncy conversation with a coworker I’ll call J. I use the adjective bouncy because we seemed to have spoken about 4 different topics in under 15 minutes. I like those types of conversations because it shows how much you can stretch into a single talk. For instance, the title of this post was one of the many topics we discussed while we vegged out at the front desk. I can’t be 100% on what steered the talk of drug and alcohol addiction. Regardless, he asked my opinion of it and I have to admit that I prefer asking other people about their thoughts rather than think it through, myself. I have a generic idea of what I think of addiction: it’s bad. 
So, I asked J what he thought of the subject and these were his words (paraphrased because we all know I don’t remember much), “Ultimately, they bring it upon themselves.” J and I spoke of some personal examples (he used to be a cop so he saw some shit) and he explained that he didn’t feel for people who spiraled into addicted because they should, at some point, find their limits. 
For the most part, I agree with him. Of course, there are days when someone may want to drink or even go as far as getting shit-faced, but you have to remind yourself of your responsibilities. The thing is, no one has the same situation and I really don’t enjoy generalizing the universe. 
The other side to this is people who either don’t become addicts or people who choose to seek help understand that drugs and alcohol outside of moderation are not good for you. Therefore, they should not make the mistake/keep making the mistake. That’s what confuses me. If there are people out there who understand then what’s to say about the others who don’t? Or maybe they do understand but choose not to change; therefore they are bringing it upon themselves, as J said. 
When I told him about wanting to turn our conversation into a blog post, he assumed you readers would scramble to your keyboards to disagree with him, but I can’t say I can agree with him. First of all, I don’t get comments. Second, I don’t know if there are too many people who disagree on his standpoint. 
I know some people may say, “Oh but addiction is derived from trauma and some people simply can’t stop using and don’t have the money for help.” However, that brings us back to the initial question of, “If people understand addiction is bad, why would they fall into it to begin with?” There’s plenty to dissect with this topic and I’m interested in hearing any other standpoints to this. Like I said before, I don’t like generalizing everyone’s situation so I can’t completely agree with J. However, you have to admit he does make a good point.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9970369338989258}"

She is spiteful and refuses help while also lashing out at us for not helping - I have no idea what to do. I miss my grandparents.

I feel like theres so much that needs to be said to explain my family but I'm trying to keep it to just this issue-

Let me start off by saying I grew up seeing my grandmother sober. I didn't experience any hint of her past use until I was roughly 17. She has fallen back into her alcoholism in the last 8 years. We saw it slowly, a drink at dinner or a glass of wine at a party, but nothing big but it made my mom wildly uncomfortable as she DID grow up experience all of it. I can only 100% say that she is drinking, however both of my aunts have mentioned they believe she has also turned to drug use again ( weed 100% but unsure of what else). Weed alone would not worry my family but it is not only that, I just can't confirm what else is being used.

My grandmother has been experiencing a LOT of stress lately. She picked up her life about 8 years ago to live in her retirement cabin a state away. During this time it came to light that my grandfather (Also a recovered(ing?) addict) had Parkinson and is was going down hill pretty fast. She decided not to move back to family and keep him in Oregon permanently. We asked her a few times to move back so that we could help in care giving but she refused and until this year has refused any help with nursing for him. I have also made the trip down there to see them, the atmosphere was not at all welcoming despite her saying I could stay with her. She didn't want any help then and said she had friends down there that were supporting her. I met a few of them, although nice people they were enabling her drinking and general angst towards my mother.

The last few years have been really rocky with her, we tried to be as understanding as possible and just offer help but she often took offense to help that was offered and then lashed out at people for not helping enough. Talking to her is a constant walk on egg shells because if you mention her drinking, needing help or anything related to her or my grandfathers health she starts getting agitated. For Christmas my aunt and uncle drove 8 hours to see her and bring their kids. They usually camp outside the cabin and cook for themselves to avoid making her do any extra work for them - However this year when they arrived she lashed out at them in front of the kids, yelling and screaming about how they are 'takers' and only want her money and so on. Which is wildly incorrect and they are the ones that try the MOST to be helpful. She took my grandfathers phone away and refuses to let anyone have contact with just him, although it has been long enough now he isn't capable of much on his own. I hate to say it but I do hold a bit of resentment on the years I wasn't able to see him because of how she has cut us out. I dont feel like I know my grandparents anymore, which is big since I grew up being so close to them.

I don't feel like I can bring up the drug use or drinking, I don't feel like it's my place but at the same time at this rate I am terrified that I will lose them both completely here soon.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.996940016746521}"

I have an extremely compulsive drug-seeking behavior. I had 6 main addictions over my life; the most serious being opiates, cocaine and JWH - followed by tobacco, benzos and weed.

there is massive research about the role of glutamate activation on drug-seeking behavior ([reference 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4633516/) , [reference 2](https://www.drugabuse.gov/news-events/latest-science/unraveling-mystery-glutamate-dopamine-connection)

NMDA receptor antagonists are relative new targets for treating addiction. ( [reference 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3816684/) , [reference 4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gbb.12348)

when you abuse certain drugs like cocaine, alcohol or opiates, your body is depleted from water-soluble vitamins and minerals (especially during detox). the main issue here is the B complex, which is completely essential for proper brain function.  [[reference 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772032/) 

another important one is magnesium, a natural NMDA antagonist, calcium channels and GABA modulator ( [reference 6 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/30714574/) ,  [reference 7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507260/) [[reference 8](https://canprev.ca/all/magnesium-anxiety-depression-and-the-brain/) 



I’m 20 days clean, and am currently suffering from psychological addiction. all this new year’s partying are a strong trigger for someone like me. on desperation 6 days ago I bought magnesium chloride powder and started taking a teaspoon on the morning and another at night. yesterday I woke up feeling much lighter and overall feeling good. I didn’t even connected one thing to another, I thought it was just my mind recovering, and today I noticed a huge mood-stabilizer activity from taking the magnesium. 

***I took magnesium only after consulting my doctor. this is an experience report and not a medical advice, always talk to your doc before ingesting any pharmaceuticals***

it really is working like a light general tranquilizer. i’m not having the compulsive and intrusive thoughts I usually get, im smoking way less and overall enhanced mental clarity.

in conclusion it is doing wonders for me. if any of you reading this decide to take magnesium make sure you don’t consume the laxative formulations (mainly oxide and hydroxide). if you are quitting opiates and take a laxative you gonna have a shitty time (pun intended)

magnesium chloride is not the best formulation, it is in the middle ground between the best and the worst, but it’s what I have access to.

peace and a happy new year

Edit: Supplementing water soluble nutrients (mainly B complex, Vitamin C and magnesium) should be a first-line treatment for acute drug withdrawals. 

It eases a lot of unnecessary suffering and makes the detox much smoother.",68,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.979302704334259}"

I started from a young age, 7-8 with the original call of duty but it only really got bad when I was 12-13.

I did fuck all at school except play cod and halo before moving on to dota and league and my schooling suffered a lot.

My gcses where completely rubbish and I failed at becoming a electrician to.

But hay  at least I got to prestige 10 in all most every cod since MW and had 3000h on dota 2 with probably even more hours in league of legends (not to mention 4 digits spent on fucking skins).

And now at 23 working in Paris as a developer , I feel like shit all the time because everyone I work with has a masters degree and I feel like I wasted 10 plus years of my life.

There are strikes on in Paris at the moment so I'm forced to work from home but I find it impossible.

As soon as I try to work my brain is telling me just one game, then I give in and I end up playing 7h straight.

So this weekend I'm going to sell my ps4 xbox and gaming pc (work laptop can't play anything anyway).

I'm going to start studying instead and try and retake my gcse and A levels and try and get a masters degree.",64,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9996019005775452}"
2020-01-02 15:57:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ej45xc/nonpharmaceutical_noninvasive_relief_of_chronic/,"Non-pharmaceutical, Non-invasive Relief of Chronic and Withdrawal Pain","*NOTE: This post is NOT selling a product or service!* Its sole purpose is to inform you about a highly effective and inexpensive treatment for withdrawal and chronic pain that you can apply to yourself at home. It’s called Bio-electrode Therapy, and has been relieving pain for thousands of people in Vancouver BC who were suffering through withdrawal, as well as other kinds of chronic pain that so frequently lead to addiction in the first place. Please see this video of two people being treated for withdrawal stress and chronic pain conditions:

Les Moncreiff, the person who developed it has worked in Vancouver addiction services for 36 years, and his astonishing therapy is now getting serious attention from medical people in the field. He's about to retire, and wants addicts everywhere to know about this -- to end the incredible misery he's witnessed for decades. 

Les is making no money from the DIY materials listed below, which can be bought at any grocery, drug, or stationery store for well under $100, and be sufficient to pull you (and probably several of your friends) through detox with little to no pain. You can easily treat yourself at home to relieve chronic pain, or to detoxify without the agony of withdrawal symptoms. 

Best wishes for your recovery. You are on a hero’s journey.

**Bio-electrode Therapy© for Opioid Withdrawal: Instructions**

**What you’ll need**

1. The photo or illustration of the protocol (see video)

2. Electrodes, for which two options exist:

Option A: Copper and Silver Conductive INKS

Option B: Copper and Silver Electrode DISCS (see “Making Your Own Electrode  

Discs,” below)

3. A small dipstick (A wooden matchstick will do. Even better, remove an ink tube from a pen and cut it to the right length. Blow all the ink from inside the thin, hollow tube. Stuff the end of the tube with a bit of sponge foam. You will have an extremely easy and precise instrument!)

4. Something to secure the electrodes. For discs, use surgical tape. For the ink electrodes, a waterproof use a topical adhesive coating like New Skin. (Graftobian Spirit Gum works best.)

**Bio­-electrode INKS:**

Copper and silver electrode inks are available at chemicalstore\[dot\]com. In the search box, type in the code “INKPAIR,” and you will be taken to the Bio-electrode Therapy inks. The two bottles will cost $45 total, and will last for hundreds of treatments. 

Note: Making your own metal electrodes is easy and much cheaper:

**Making Your Own Electrode DISCS:**

You can easily make the electrode discs with an office paper hole punch. I prefer the Swingline Lever Professional 2 Hole Punch Model: 74101. It makes the perfect ¼ inch diameter electrodes. This hole punch is good quality, solid steel construction, and can be purchased on-line from any office supply store. 

Purchase a *thin* 99.95 % pure copper metal sheet from a local sheet metal supplier. 

(I purchase the copper sheets from metalsupermarkets\[dot\]com. Aluminum electrodes can be made from aluminum foil from your kitchen, but I prefer to make the electrodes from thicker gauge aluminum trays from a Dollar store or any supermarket. You can have an endless supply with this simple method for making copper and silver electrode discs. 

I have been using 3M Micropore tape (1/2 inch) to secure the metal disc electrodes to the fingers, toes, and other acupuncture points. Any type of tape will work, but obviously some tapes work better than others, being transparent, hypoallergenic, etc.  

**Application of the INK Electrodes:**

1. Thoroughly clean all the selected acupuncture points with an alcohol swab.

*2. Stir the ink contents with a dip stick to thoroughly mix the metal particles in the solution.*

3. Apply the ink electrodes to the acupuncture points with the dip stick and allow them several minutes to dry.

4. Apply the Graftobian Spirit Gum waterproof adhesive as a topical coating over the ink electrodes to secure the electrodes. With some care, the ink should remain secure for a couple days. 

This will improve adhesion strength and waterproof them. (For best results, apply the adhesive twice daily.)

5. When the electrodes fall off, pain will usually return. Simply replace the lost electrodes with fresh ones. *As long as they are on, healing is taking place as well as pain relief.* In most cases, pain sufferers are able to stop using the electrodes after months, weeks, or even days.

**Application of the Electrode DISCS**

1. Secure the electrodes to the acupuncture points using tape. (Any tape will do, although many people prefer surgical tape.)

2. When the electrodes fall off, pain will usually return. Simply replace the lost electrodes with fresh ones. *As long as they are on, healing is taking place as well as pain relief.* In most cases, pain sufferers are able to stop using the electrodes after months, weeks, or even days.

**Ink Electrodes Versus Disc Electrodes**

Both types of electrodes work. My preference is to use the copper and silver ink electrodes, for several reasons. They are easy to apply and will remain secure for one or two days and longer. Real silver Ag is used, providing superior conductivity, as well as the antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal properties of silver ions. The laborious and unhygienic taping of the electrode discs to toes is not required. With the discs, the tape tends to get wet and dirty by the end of the day. They are also a bit uncomfortable, and many patients feel that the appearance of tape on fingers and toes is unattractive. The inks are more comfortable, and hardly noticeable. In fact, they can look quite interesting and attractive. No more wrestling with taping toes!

**Electrolyte-Balancing Beverage**

An electrolyte-balancing beverage should be encouraged in all therapeutic settings, particularly those in which the patient is in an extremely debilitated conditions as described in Chapter 9, or has suffered blood or fluid loss, or trauma like heart attack. A simple electrolyte beverage should ideally be consumed prior to and during bio-electrode treatment to enhance treatment efficacy and further stabilize patient wellness.

Homemade Electrolyte Beverage Recipe:

•   500 ml (17 oz) water

•   3 tablespoons maple syrup (raw honey is an alternative option)

•   1 tsp coarse sea salt

•   Lemon juice, to taste

•   Lime juice, to taste

Combine all ingredients and stir thoroughly. Drink throughout the day.

**Explanation of Electrolyte Drink Ingredients** 

Citrus fruits are rich in electrolytes. Lemons have the most of any of them. The naturally occurring sugars in these fruit juices also help to maintain energy during the healing process. It will ease pain and speed recovery. Also rich in Vitamin C, citrus fruits help to maintain the immune system, and are therefore great remedies for acute and post-acute withdrawal from drugs and alcohol.

For the maple syrup and/or honey, the most important considerations are that the maple syrup is real, and that the honey is raw. Maple syrup is loaded with antioxidants and electrolytes. Many so-called “syrups” are cut with high fructose corn syrup and contain artificial flavors and colors. Raw honey is filled with natural enzymes and minerals. Pasteurization kills honey’s enzymes and antioxidants. The easily digestible sugars in both maple syrup and honey are great to keep energy high during recovery. 

The reason for choosing sea salt rather than common table salt is that sea salt is rich in several dozen trace minerals that our bodies need to survive (specifically sodium, magnesium, potassium, and calcium). Table salt does not contain any of those minerals because of the way that it is processed*.* Sea salt plays an important role in balancing the stress hormones during health recovery. Salt reduces adrenaline levels and supports overall metabolic health.  Pink Himalayan salt also has all the important trace minerals.

NOTE: Real coconut water makes an excellent alternative to the electrolyte-balancing drink. Coconut water is the perfect source of electrolytes for hangovers, drug and alcohol withdrawal/recovery, and illness. Indeed, it is often called “Nature’s Gatorade” because it is extremely high in potassium content (one of the main functioning electrolytes that your body needs to prevent cramping); however, with thirteen times more potassium than Gatorade, less sugar, more electrolytes, and twice the sodium, coconut water is highly preferable to Gatorade. It is loaded with the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients needed for rehydration and healing. The balance of electrolytes and fluids found in coconut water is close to that which exists inside the cell. Plus, it tastes great.",1,"{'viral': 1, 'immun': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9942553639411926}"

I've been addicted to pills (Ecstasy) since September 2018, I've absolutely wrecked my brain because of it and I'm finally going to a local Recovery Near You (UK) for help tomorrow. I don't know how it got this bad, I never thought I could get addicted to pills, I guess it's a mental addiction more than a psychical one, but I'm addicted nevertheless. I've put it off for so long and I won't lie I'm really scared about tomorrow.

I've probably always had addiction problems, I used to be obese though not anymore as the drugs have changed that, I guess that's one of the only real ""benefits"" if you can call it that, that's came out of this whole shit situation. I'm scared of if this all won't work in the end and I need some guidance really. If anyone's been in my situation, pills I mean, could I keep in contact with you? I don't really have anyone I can talk to as my parents know of it but I can see it in their face they're disappointed in me and it makes me cry.

I started to take them as a fun thing to do while going out to town and came to realize it did actually help me with my social anxiety, I don't suffer from it anymore. But a fun thing to do turned into a weekly thing, I don't know how I'm still alive, I can't even remember the amount I've taken. I've always had anger problems but they've made it way worse, I just snap at the slightest of things, I have a terrible memory, I feel sad often (serotonin levels) among a bunch of other shit.

I've already had been dealing with mental illness and suicidal thoughts alone because my parents had their own lives, careers, and families that they just didnt want to put their time into me even after I was Hospitalized for suicidal thoughts and I had been abusing substances, whatever it may be, and they didnt even notice I mean one day I took some xanax and they never noticed. When I was on painkillers no one even noticed or cared to stop me as a child. My father beat me and mentally abused me, my sisters never were there or cared enough to be there for me or ask if i was ok during my severe depression episodes. Even after begging my mom and family to just check on me or invite me to go out or just do family stuff since I had no friends and till this day have no friends that care enough to ask or check in on me. I abused drugs since I was in freshman in highschool, first started smoking weed but as the issues got worse I just constantly wanted to escape or die. I was taking many things, ambien, acid, benzos, painkillers, sharpies, alcohol, and cough syrup while I was on prozac and anti depressants cause the o boy thing my own mother knew what to do was to medicate me and leave me tf alone and deal with it on my own and deal with withdrawals alone when I tried stopping as a teen and it was painful. I have so much anger I just cant explain it how much I hate them and have told them that. I wanted to get better I wanted to be someone who had a promising future but no they were to focused on their new families they just fucking kicked me out to focus on their step kids. I'm hanging by a thread to my life, I've been suicidal since 2010 and it's just getting worse. I have a job, been trying to get a different one that isnt toxic but I get so depressed I dont even show up to my other interviews because I just cant deal with the past still it still has the same sting and it drives me crazy I yell at myself for not being able to get rid of my past and the pain. I still hope for the day I catch someone on their bad day out here in the hood and they just put one in my head I could care less if they rob me as long as I can get a bullet in my head we are good. Currently I am addicted to substances that are way milder than the hard drugs I was doing before but it's still an addiction...I've been taking kratom daily heavily since 2017, and been dabbing heavily everyday since 2015 and honestly the times I've tried quitting, I swear my body was in pain and I was about to die. Mind you I dont have the luxury to not go to work, I'm homeless living in an broken rv trailer that's not very warm during the winter. I dont have any support or anyone to talk to me or just be by my side to watch tv or anything, I'm not going to get a dog and make he or she suffer with me in such a horrible environment I wouldnt want my dog to live where I live and it drives me crazy cause I know having a dog would help out but I'm in no position to care for one. 

I may be rambling I'm not sure but I just have no where else to express myself, I've had so much happen i never open up about it or ever able to explain it all. I wish I could afford rehab and have the support system needed after rehab but I know I dont. No one cares, and maybe you all may say that there are people who care but its subjective and most the time even people I hear that are supposedly great and caring end up treating me like shit so I isolate. I dont know how to be a proper person and interact or deal with social cues or the way social relationships go about. I mean make fun of me if you think I cant be addicted to kratom and concentrated cannabis but anything can be addictive, I'll admit I get addicted to anything that gives me pleasure or a sense of peace since in so use to nothing but hell.

What makes me more angry is that I have people who abandoned me and can help me right now but decide to just send me letter saying they always have loved me and whatever lying 2 faced bullshit they tell me but words are just words. They knew I was looking for help but no there excuse is that they dont know how to help, yet spend all their time helping others. Yea I hope people like this fuck off cause they just assumed they couldnt help or so they tell themselves to feel better about the situation and not like they chose to abandon someone.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9992306232452393}"

For some context, never been a full blown addict but have dabbled in drugs and alcohol since my teens. Never got so out of hand that I had to go to rehab but I’ve fallen pretty deep in alcohol and kratom. Always managed to cut it down once it started to become habit forming and effecting the following day. 

My question to everyone is this dealing with this terrible feeling I get a few hours before sleep. Without any booze or Kratom I get this dread that overcomes me. It’s a massive and intense emptiness that needs to be filled. I used to use alcohol then started with kratom. I thought kratom was my saviour, but after my tolerance became higher and higher, it started to effect me the next day and I knew it had to go.

Some of the worst things I was addicted to was MDMA, snorting pills, and Alcohol. Nothing crazy, but nothing minor like caffeine.

After getting rid of the ""harder"" drugs from my life, I'm now overwhelmed by these 4 main addictions that seem to keep me enslaved to my depression, anxiety, and lethargy in life.

I'm a highly ambitious and motivated individual, but these 4 things really chain me down from my full potential and cause me so much stress, unhappiness, and lack of motivation.

These 4 things are weed, nicotine, caffeine, and porn.

I've been on and off with quitting these things, picking them back up, quitting again, you get the loop.

I've went through periods were I've abstained from some, or all of these things for a month.

But I always seem to relapse on one thing, then the another, then I'm back into a full-blown loop of these addictions.

Drink coffee to brush away the fogginess and tiredness brought about by weed. Hit nicotine to deal with my anxiety and mood swings. Smoke weed to brush away the anxiety and over-stimulation brought on by the caffeine; and to brush away the boredom I experience with life. Then watch porn to relax and take my mind elsewhere than my mental issues. Wake up the next morning, and do it all again.

I hate this loop I'm stuck in, but for the last 4 years I can't seem to escape the loop.

I am consistently involved in support groups for my addictions here on reddit, but I always struggle at staying on my path. It's so hard to quit one thing, because all my addictions trigger me to want to use the other drug.

If I get rid of weed, I can't sleep at night because of the nicotine and caffeine.

If I get rid of nicotine or caffeine, then I can't barely get through the day because the weed has me slumped all day.

I don't know where to start, and how to tackle my addictions one at a time.

Could somebody please help me find a way to get on my path and stick to it? I want to be completely sober and away from these things, as I recognize I have problems with them.

The cravings are the worst thing for me. I decided to quit cold turkey yesterday, and it’s hard because I suffer from anxiety and depression among other issues and I used nicotine a lot to helped calm me down. Over time, I’ve learned healthier coping habits to stray away from my toxic tendencies and have drastically improved in regards to how I handle my emotions but nicotine is the main problem for me now, especially since I tend to get addicted to things very very easily. 

I turned 18 after the law was placed into effect in my state that raised the age to buy tobacco products to 21 and so I wasn’t grandfathered into it. My boyfriend and friends were buying things for me, but my boyfriend is really set on wanting to quit which I’m proud of and support and I’m not going to be selfish and ask him to buy me things while he’s trying to quit so it’s time for me to call it quits too. 

So basically my access to anything is zero. That’s a start. Im going to throw away all of my products and everything is pretty much empty anyways. So I don’t have anything. 

I want to focus on replacement behaviors. I know my triggers, when i have caffeine, when I’m anxious or panicking, etc. so maybe I’ll have some gum or drink something for the oral fixation part of it. 

What else is there I can do? It helps that most of everyone around me is quitting too, so chances that ill be influenced by my friends are low. Is there a book I can read that’s good and might help? What’s something that has worked for you guys in your journey to fight addiction? 

TL;DR: quit nicotine, is there anything that has helped for you? If you have a success story, can you share it? For those who have quit long term, how has it benefited you and how you feel now? Does this get any easier?",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994040727615356}"

Started off using it gradually then got involved in the drugs trade witch didn’t help having it around me all the time I ended up doing about 3.5 grams a day completely ruined my nose and dropped about 4 stone in weight that’s about 56 pounds. The come downs became so severe it left me with crippling anxiety. Took about a year of telling myself I need to stop this before I managed to kick the habit the day I stopped being involved with cocaine was the last time I did any that was last June so been free of drugs for 7 months now. Was the hardest thing I’ve ever done but it’s possible with the right support.

I can picture it without cocaine: and fuck it would be HEAVEN vs what it is now. I don’t crave it. I’m not in withdrawal. I hate it. But once a girl from my past gets calling or a lavish party gets into gear, the lights turn on and it’s all I ever wanted. More than the thought of heaven itself. Well in thecontext  of sex at least.

2020-01-01 01:45:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/eifa4z/my_sister_is_struggling_with_addiction_and_i_dont/,My sister is struggling with addiction and I don't know what to do,"I come from a very tight knit family and this past year everything has been shattered. I'm the youngest of 4 sisters and one by one they've all disappeared from me. I know I sound really melodramatic, but it's New Years day I've been sobbing at my computer for the past hour looking at old messages and I just feel broken and empty inside and I need some place to tell my story. I'm going to give everyone pseudonyms for anonymity. Oldest sister will be Jackie, second oldest will be Evette, third oldest will be Nancy.

My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer when I was 16. We were told she had only 2 months to live and we all prepared for the worst, but it didn't happen. I became her sole caretaker and dedicated every day to seeing to her health and she's still alive today. It hasn't been easy, but with the support from my family I've gone on. 

My oldest sister, Jackie, has been dealing with addiction my whole life and as a result I've had to cut her out of my life 6 years ago when she attacked me with a knife and broke my ankle and wrist. I adopted her 2 kids when I was 18 and it hasn't been easy, but with the support from my family I've gone on.

At 20 my second oldest sister, Evette, my best friend had a mental breakdown after which she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Mental illness changed her to the point where she was unrecognizable. She became violent, she heard her voices tell her mean things about us and thought nobody wanted her or loved her. We grew distant and she spent the next few years in and out of mental hospitals as I or my other sister took care of her young son as necessary.

Late 2018-early 2019 Jackie began to get back into my life. I was dead against it, but my mom really wanted her around and there was nothing I could really do. I stayed away from her and was a recluse when she was around. Around this same time I was in a very toxic abusive relationship that absorbed me in a lot of ways, and my sister being around pushed me away from them to him who was isolating me from my family.

Unbeknownst to me while I was dealing with my abusive relationship Jackie was introducing Evette and Nancy to the drugs that had consumed her for so long, which she was supposedly off of.

February 2019 Evette dies in her sleep. At the time I thought it was due to complications from her asthma, it's only recently that I've found out that it was a drug complication between the drugs she was given by Jackie and the anti-psychotics she was on for her schizophrenia. Jackie and Nancy were there at the time of her death doing the same drugs when Evette said she wasn't feeling well. Nancy told her to lay down and got her a damp cloth and then began arguing with Jackie over something while Evette was dying in the other room. The police are called and Jackie sneaks out of the house (she had a warrant), does more drugs and ODs. She lives, but loses her housing because of her relapse. She's set to appear in court, but instead leaves the state.

Nancy, the only other sister I have, falls further into drug use, again unbeknownst to me. She begins neglecting her kids, cheating on her husband, starting arguments with everyone close to her. Our relationship becomes strained due to these arguments that happen every time we're together and I distance myself further from her - still in the middle of this abusive relationship that's encouraging my isolation.

The rest of us make plans to move upstate, back where we came from to be close to family - the same place Jackie left to, only Nancy doesn't want to leave. She denies she's cheating on her husband, but it seems clear she doesn't want to leave this guy shes been hanging around with a lot, someone with his own kids he's abandoned, as well as a failed marriage and a drug problem. She also seems to be having a mental breakdown, she's talking a lot more about god and needing to save people and having a lot of questionable people around her claiming she wants to save them. Her behavior has become more erratic since the death of Evette. I believe that if we leave she'll follow quickly behind, realizing that we're serious, so we leave the state, leaving her in our home giving her a month to come up behind us. She's now away from all of us as well as her kids.

She doesn't come behind us, she doesn't pay the rent of our house, she ends up evicted. Us, on the other hand, back up state end up struggling to find housing with the eviction on our record from Nancy not leaving or paying rent. We've been here since July and we're still homeless, meanwhile both my mom and her husband are bleeding money to send back to her so that she has a hotel to sleep in and food to eat.

Her husband and kids end up going to his home state, he's still trying to get her to come back, but apparently now she hates him and is trying to get my mom to take her kids away from him. I really don't know what's going on with her, to be honest. I haven't spoken to her since July and I was so upset with her I don't think I even said goodbye. Last thing I heard was that her husband got into her facebook account and saw all the messages she was sending this guy she supposedly wasn't involved with, saying how she loves him and how now that both of their marriages aren't working out they can be together. Apparently he's ignoring her now and hasn't replied to a message since November.

I know she's on drugs. I know she's not herself and hasn't been since Evette died. I'm terrified at the thought of her being on the streets alone. I heard from a friend she has on the streets that she was raped while sleeping outside. She can come back at any moment. We don't have a home yet, either, but we're not on the streets, and both my mother and I and her husband have offered to pay for a ticket to get her here so that she's no longer in this scenario, but consistently she hasn't come. I don't know what to do, but every once in a while on a night like this where I'm thinking of this past year and how much of a failure it was and how miserable and depressed I am that this is what my life has become I begin to worry about her, or I'll look back on old conversations or messages from her and I'm wrought with such grief. I just don't know what to do and I don't know where to turn.

> Three little cubs call me Mama Bear, my one and only has my heart & together they give me the drive to keep striving for greater things.

This was her just about a year and a half ago, and now she hasn't seen her kids since July. When we call her husband my nieces and nephews will hear my voice or my moms voice and yell ""mommy!"" because they think we're her. I just..... I don't know, man. I have a lot weighing on me. Sometimes I feel like I'm all out of motivation to even be anymore. I want things to be different, but I don't know how to make that happen.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9653932452201843}"
