2020-09-29 19:33:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/j2au8f/addiction_to_music/,Addiction to music,"Sorry if this isn't the right subreddit. I have the feeling that this subreddit is more for addiction to drugs and alcohol but saw some others too. If there is a better place to post this, feel free to show me the way.

If you're here to roll your eyes at the title or think this is dumb, do yourself a favor and don't bother wasting your time by replying to this at all.  I'm already embarrassed enough that I created a throwaway account. I'm probably the only person in the world addicted to fucking listening to *music*.

Now, let me explain what I mean, because I don't think much else can relate, and you're probably wondering what I mean when I say I'm ADDICTED to it. I spend all, and I do mean literally all, of my free time listening to music. I've loved music for a very long time. There are very few genres I do not like.

But this goes so much more than just a quirky little ""Haha I'm always listening to music, I listen to it even when I work and study lol"" because that's just the problem- I *can't* work, study, or in general focus on anything I need to do, when I'm listening to music. I'm just focusing on jamming out. And when the song's over, I don't just go back to doing what I need to do- I waste more time looking for a new song to listen to, if I'm not just repeating the same song over and over and over and over again. I will go home, and think I need to get something done, but just immediately go on youtube and waste my entire afternoon listening to music until it's time to go to bed.

It used to keep me up all night. I recently decided to make my computer automatically shut off about an hour before bed. That works a lot, but A. I can still access music on my phone, which is a problem, so I'm probably going to delete youtube and all music apps on my phone soon. And B. that still doesn't fix the problem of me wasting all of my free time listening to music.

Hell, it doesn't just keep me from doing things I need to do, it keeps me from doing things I WANT to do as well. I used to love playing video games, but I haven't really given a shit about games in years now. Same for any TV shows I like, or books. Even if I spend all day thinking about these things and being excited to try out a new game or TV show or book that looks good to me, I immediately just hop on youtube and waste the whole day listening to music instead.

It goes back to when I was a child. I started this addiction when I was 4. Back then, Napster was a thing. And I was hooked on using Napster all the time. Then when I was 5, Youtube came out and that was my life basically. Although even then, I still did other things, like games and books, but when I was playing games or reading books, I was wasting my childhood listening to music rather than playing with other kids. And I know it was already an addiction then, because I remember when I was 11 or so, for whatever reason that I cannot remember, we had to go without internet for about a month or two. And I went fucking NUTS. I tried to calm myself by listening to music in my head but it wasn't enough. I wanted to listen to music so bad, it sounds fucking stupid but I really did feel like an addict that had his dope taken from him.

I think the reason I developed this addiction was for two reasons in particular: 1. I lived with undiagnosed ADD my whole life. I only got it diagnosed and medicated for it this year at the age of 20. For those who don't know, having ADD basically means my brain does not produce the same amount of dopamine that a normal person does, so I'm constantly looking for stimulation. So, it makes sense to me that music would be particularly addictive to my ADD brain, since music is probably the most stimulating, dopamine producing thing I can think of. Now I'm on meds which has definitely changed my life for the better, and I can actually focus on things now... provided that I don't have access to music. I can do great at work but as soon as I get home, I can't focus on anything else because I've already had this horrible habit ingrained in my life. 2. I didn't have a great childhood, everybody thought I was the weird kid so I had no friends, I had undiagnosed ADD so I did shitty in school but my parents had great expectations for me, my father and step mother were abusive AND I grew up knowing I was LGBT, living in a very anti-LGBT home... music was basically there for me when nobody else was, it comforted me, I could enjoy it without the company of anybody else, and yet it made me feel so much less alone. It made and still makes me forget about all my problems, but to what I now see as such an unhealthy degree.

Here's what I've tried so far: I originally started with blocking YouTube, because a while, I thought the addiction was to YouTube. I had to unblock it because I learn things really well by looking up someone doing it in a YouTube video, because I'm a visual learner. The other obvious thing to do would be to block/delete any other music sites and apps such as Spotify, Pandora, Bandcamp etc. (I should note that I have always primarily used YouTube. I know there are far better mediums for listening to music out there, but I have always used YouTube because I feel it is far more convenient for me; I think this is because I've been using it since I was a small child. It's why I went crazy during that internetless period, because I relied on it so much that I never bought any CDs nor did I learn how to download music from the internet. But honestly, looking back that's a good thing.)

But this is my biggest concern: I really don't want to give up music completely. If it wasn't made obvious before, it's such a big part of my life that if I didn't listen to music at all... I think my life would feel just so EMPTY. Not only that, but, I don't want to be seen as the weirdo that doesn't ever listen to music. I can see the conversation, ""Why don't you listen to music."" ""Oh, because I'm addicted to it..."" Nobody would take me seriously! And besides, there really just isn't any resources as far as I've seen. With drug related addictions, you try to avoid drugs or alcohol as much as you can- how can you avoid MUSIC? How am I supposed to combat this entirely? Is it possible to learn how to listen in moderation, despite how long I've lived with this?

TL;DR: I waste all my time listening to music and I can't get anything done because of it. How can I, at the very least, cut my music listening time down?",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6587356}"

This post features strange, unusual, and possibly unsettling content that I'd advise staying away from unless you're okay with Classic Internet-Branded Weird, and are also a seasoned internet user. If you continue reading and want to comment, please be civil.

I'm 22 years old and I live in the UK. Since I was about 7 or 8 years old I've been subject to pretty much all of the bizarre internet fetishes you can think of. I'm into vore, I'm into inflation, all of the crazy ones you see on DeviantArt. To clarify - nothing illegal, thankfully. I want to make it clear that I am in fact just a normal guy with a job and friends, and I'm as abhorred by things such as pedophilia and necrophilia as you are. And if you're wondering about the ""7 or 8 years old"" thing - you may have found yourself fantasising about kissing a boy or girl at that age, I found myself coming up with weird cartoonish fantasies about my classmates.

Having to live with these kinks for as long as I have has been pretty terrible. It has ruined and ravaged my sexuality to the point where my reaction to porn is the same kind of reaction you'd have looking briefly at an insurance ad with a mildly attractive gender-you're-into on it, and my attraction to all of these DeviantArt fetishes is like your reaction to porn. Unsurprisingly, I would like for these to one day be the other way around.

Alright, not weirded out enough yet? Since the age of 14 I've been writing fetish/kink stories on various websites. I've gotten really, really good at it too. I may have even written more than anyone else, but I don't know. This fact, combined with the way my brain has developed an attraction to these things, has led to an intertwining of two different addictions.

The first is the dopamine hit of checking DeviantArt (the website I posted most of my stories on). I'd check maybe 10 or 11 times a day to see if people were reading the stories, favouriting them, and commenting - oh baby a comment was like the greatest hit of all. I left the site three weeks ago, stopped posting stories, wrapped everything up nicely, and haven't been back. But Jesus Christ is it hard. I get so tempted to go back that it's almost unbearable. The reason I'm writing this post is just to give me something to do instead of giving in.

The other addiction is just the primitive need for sexual stimulation. Every time I feel aroused I'm desperate to go back and find some weird internet fap material instead of heading to Porn Hub like I want to. Again, I'm yet to give in on this front, but the transition from one material to another is difficult.

So that's me. If you still have it in your mind that I'm some kind of monster or freak or anything like that... I know. I'm just trying my hardest to fix that. Trust me, I've seen enough abusive and mean comments about this kind of thing for a lifetime. I've tried quitting twice before and I can't let myself go back. If any of you have advice, encouragement, anything you like I'd love to hear it. Thanks for reading, and have a great day.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44541323}"
2020-09-29 12:18:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/j22fwj/so_with_a_spending_addiction/,SO with a spending addiction,"3 years ago my husband ran up 12000$ in debt buying junk food and premium content on video games. I found out and we almost didn’t survive it. I thought he was just selfish. 

This very week, after years of sacrifice by all members of the family, we payed it off. I was elated. Years of having an incredibly tight budget has payed off. My husband always allowed me to see the balance on his credit card, and his check was deposited into our joint account, so I thought things were going well. 

Last night I found out he has been having his work split his check. While the rest of us were going without, he spent 600$ on himself just this month. It’s been going on for a year. He estimates he took 5000$ for himself for video games and McDonald’s in that time. 

I only found out because he started physiotherapy. He told me he went Friday, but the money for the physio appointment was transferred into another account instead of being charged to the physio company like normal. 

Turns out that his normal ~500$ he skimmed a month out of our finances wasn’t enough this month, so he pretended to go to physio and went out and bought a disposable visa for his online games instead. 

I’m starting to realize that he is ill. So is he. But I’m at a loss for what to do next. Is it appropriate for him to give me all his cards and cut off all his access to money? That’s what he wants me to do, but that feels...wrong? Abusive? Plus won’t that just push him into other ways of spending? Payday loans, credit cards I don’t know about, stealing, etc?

So back in July I decided I would try to stop smoking weed for good. I was smoking off and on, but almost daily at times for a little over a year. I also starting vaping nic back in November. And I went cold turkey with that too back in July. I’m starting to somewhat feel back to my normal self as far as with doing school and retaining information and having improved memory for sure. I’ve always suffered with anxiety and I feel like I have ADHD and possibly OCD as well. And so the anxiety got too overwhelming to the point that I started smoking weed in the first place and fell in love with it, but as time went on I started smoking too much and it actually made my anxiety much worse. Now, I’m still dealing with pretty bad headaches and fatigue most of the time from the withdrawal and I feel pretty depressed. My anxiety is still somewhat bad but maybe that will get better in time and maybe I can figure out something that will work for it.

Hi r/addiction

I am not sure if this is the right forum for this post but here goes..

I myself have been smoking weed on and off for 8-9 years, starting at 16, i'm turning 25 next month currenty over 100 days sober.

I will finish my engineering degree in January, so my use which progressed and got worse over the years, until the point where i smoked about 2-3 joints a day for a couple of those years did not prevent me from somewhat succeeding in acedemia, but my mentality has always been bound in reaching the bare minimal to get through.

I come from a low income family, i have never really had a relationship with my father, and i believe that has a big say in how my marijuana ab(use) developed. Since i started looking for role models in the wrong crowds, and became attached to people that i percieved as ""cool"" throughout high school years and up, as a matter of fact, i think i always sought out the rebilious crowds. While that has showed me another side of life that i can appreciate, it definently has also had its countless down sides. - Marijuana has not been the only substance that have used, i have tried a number of different things from MDMA, Shrooms, pills, ketamine, all below 10 times, however cocaine has been, and unfortunatly still is a devil of mine, whenever alcohol is involved. I would never touch it sober, but after 3-4 drinks, im craving it really bad, it really destroyed drinking alcohol for me, and i dont know how my future looks like in regards to that specific substance, i dont feel like i have the power at the moment to quit drinking, but i feel like thats the only option at this point, if i really want to kick that habit. (i drink about once every 2 months)

\- Now here is the thing, my younger brother who is 15 at the moment came home with red-eyes twice this week (my mother told me) - i live by myself. I am 100% sure that he has smoked, there is not a single doubt in my mind. My brother has a different father than me, so i guess you could say that he is my half brother, although i see him 100% as a ""normal"" brother. But the same story goes for him, he has not spoken to his father for several years, his father basically tried to choke my mother and has not really shown any great father potential in general. (i could list countless examples, but thats not the essential part of this post)

So i recognize the same patterns in his behaviour, crowds, feelings and friendships that i had myself at his age, so i understand what seems so exiting about the ""culture"" that he is starting to follow. Which makes it really hard to figure out how to go about it. I dont want him to go down the same road as i did, he has so much potential and is a clever young man, but i feel that he is detached from himself, i fear he will numb the things he experienced in his earlier childhood by going down this road, same as i did.

Our familiy has certainly had its battles throughout the years, most do - but i fear that he will ""cope"" the same way i did, which i think is really unhealthy and potentially dangerous.

I am so sick of rap which sort of became pop culture glorifying sex and drugs, its sickening to me, they are basically role models for so many young children, and they use it to promote their own inadequacy - that was a side note, i think i just needed to vent all of this, i will take any advice in our situation, however i also think that every situation is unique and that only our small family will have to figure out the right way to adress this.

Also i am trying not to either over nor' under react, but my alarms are ringing. Also i guess i feel a bit guilty, however i know why i have done and do what i do, my mother tried the yelling, screaming and hitting on me in the past, she knows today that this method leads to nothing then lies and detachment, i advised her that we need to be very open with my younger brother, and not try to control him with anger, but rather try to understand him with compassion and guidance.

I still dont have a concrete plan of how to deal with this, as i am still only healing myself, but i dont think being passive about it is the right call, so i will need to figure something out with together with my mother, so that we tackle this in the best way possible.

Sorry for the long and messy post, as i mentioned, i just needed to vent somewhere, if anyone has gone through similar obstacles, im all ears for any advice.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45713374}"

For example, I remember one instance where I was taking the garbage out at work and I could literally smell meth and taste the bitterness of it in my mouth. This was probably 1 month or so into being sober. It wouldn’t happen all the time, but when it did it was completely random and gave me cravings.

During this marriage, she has had several incidents of extreme gambling that has caused us financial stress, and 2 weeks ago she just came clean to me that she has been abusing pain medication for about a year.  She recently tried fentanyl within the last couple months and OD'd on it and almost died.  She has been hooked on it ever since.

She saw an addiction counselor last week because she wants to get better.  They gave her some sort of medicine to help with withdrawal while they wait to start her on a saboxon script tomorrow...the problem is I don't know how to deal with someone that is withdrawing.

Drugs are foreign to me and I have no experience dealing with someone going through withdrawal.  According to her, her whole body is in pain and she is always uncomfortably hot.  I see her sweating quite often even while not doing anything.  She has a lot of anger and she has been verbally abusive and violent toward me the last few days.  She has destroyed electronics, broken pieces of our refrigerator, and a few other household goods.  I'm scared of what she will do to me during these moments of anger and as a man, I can't fight back to defend myself out of fear of going to jail, so when she gets angry I just leave until she calms down.

All that said, we have kids and she would never hurt the kids....but this morning she was verbally abusive not to just me, but the kids too.  I'm sitting in a parking lot typing this out while she hopefully cools down enough to where it's safe for me to go back.

How do I deal with someone like this?  Every second I'm with her I don't know when the switch is gonna flip or if it's gonna get worse or what's going to happen.  I want to help her and be there for her, but how can I do that when she acts this way?  What do I do?",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8490349}"

There is a natural high available to you!,"I am so grateful to be delivered from my drinking problem! The 24 Hours a day book really helped me, along with really working the steps. Step 2, surrender to a higher power was especially hard for me since I was pretty much agnostic/athiest. Had been raised Christian, but had lost all faith.

What I learned from accepting my higher power is that I was trapped in the mind. The mind is like an illusion. It is always in a state of wanting and can't accept the present moment. As children, we are grounded in our inner self/true nature, but as we get older and are programmed and conditioned and start identifying with our personality, roles we play, opinions, likes and dislikes, we get lost in the mind and the world of the physical form.

I got back in touch with my inner being. Your higher power is your inner/higher self. Its the place of presence that just is. You can get in touch with it with meditation practice or journaling. When you write and take a space to feel what comes next to write, pay attention to that space within thoughts. YOU are the awareness of what's going on, not the mind. It's a tough thing.

The reason it's so hard to get back in touch with it is because the mind fears it. The mind wants to be in control and doesn't care if you do bad things. The mind is attached to the ego and YOU think that's who you are and have FORGOTTEN your true nature of beingness/awareness.

You can start practicing daily meditations now to get back in touch with your divine self/higher power.

(Cocaine, crack, and pretty much any other substance they can get their hands on) 

Throughout the years they have had falling outs, all of which ended messy but somehow always managed to stay together by ignoring the issue and pretending it was all fine. There has been police involvement; even tonight as I'm writing this it has happened numerous times and ultimately led to nothing.

Without making this post too long (because I swear I could write a story on this) I just want to talk about what transpired in the last month.

There was debt owed to a drug dealer or possibly multiple that led them to separate as one blamed the other. Mom left, and Dad fell apart. Two weeks went by and then she returned. Only to stay for a couple weeks and then it all blew up again.

This brings us to today, which started with them leaving erratically and coming back at separate times. When they were both here however, and I was sitting in the front yard, was when it went crazy. Names were thrown about, blame was placed, and when my mom went to leave my dad threw a plastic tube (which apparently was for consumption but I'm oblivious to the specifics as I've done some drugs in my life but nothing harder than cocaine) at my mom but it hit my car.

This led to me losing my cool and yelling ""that's my fucking car don't throw shit near it"" which seemed to be just shrugged off as they were too caught up in the blame game and pity party to care.

I am by no means dehumanizing addicts, but after living with them for years my patience draws thin. Later, my dad gets home from my moms apartment which she started renting at the beginning of the month to get away from him ironically, and says she hit him with her keychain and that he called the cops.

Fast forward a few hours and I hear the doorbell ring.

Surprise! City Police is here.

I tell him what I know and that my dad wasn't here. (To my knowledge he wasn't) and go back to hanging out with my girlfriend in my room. I then go downstairs about an hour later to make a smoothie and find my 26oz bottle of vodka I bought two days ago pretty much empty. I get angry, write a note saying to replace it and go back to hanging out.

I then realize a little room offshoot of the living room has it's door shut which is normally open. I check it to find to my dad passed out on the floor asking if the police came.

Internally I remark, yes you fucking idiot you called them.

But I hold my tongue and say yes but they left.

I leave him and now I sit writing this.

From an objective psychological perspective it is almost amazing how much both of my parents mental state has deteriorated and how they lie through their teeth to get what they want. My alcohol has been stolen numerous times before, my weed even. I would have no problem if he just asked but no consideration was made for me. 

My mom has also lied to me multiple times to get money from me. I have but the slightest amount of care for them left; trust is but a distant memory and most of all I feel for my younger brother who is still a child but has to spend a lot of time at my grandmothers away from this. I am very thankful for her, she was always there for me as well.

I guess my purpose for writing this is just to externalize and vent what has transpired. I'm sure there are much worse stories of addiction destroying families but this is mine.

I feel like normalcy has died this year.


TL;DR: parents are crack heads, turn on each other when the money runs out and I'm stuck trying to be a middleman. Will most likely move out soon as they do not seem to be inclined to go to rehab",31,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60869044}"

so let’s begin, i am a xanax addict as well as a binge drinker. i had 2 1/2 yrs clean from xanax (my doc), got cheated on by my bf whom i lived with at the time and relapsed for a day. i felt so guilty i called inquiring about rehab and was driven there that night. 

i didn’t realize how strong the ativan would be compared to my fake ass bars, and barely remember my first week. it’s almost like i went thru that week blacked out. i immediately liked this boy, his name is J. he arrived in detox a day after me. i instantly took a liking to him and we ended up flirting with each other non stop. the next day we kissed, and by the end of the week we were cheeking and snorting our pills while hanging around this rehab facility forming an addiction to eachother and the medications we abused together in rehab. (ativan, muscle relaxers, my buspar), anything we could snort we would. he’s the one who started doing it and because i’m an addict i followed suit. 
next thing you know, we talk about love and a future together, it was like living in a fantasy land with all my fave things: lust and drugs. and unfortunately i mistook the lust for love. he was a ketamine addict, with a troubled past. would lash out in anger at the facility bc of inconveniences, never listened to staff and loved to argue with them. as far as how he was with me, he would constantly give and take the attention. always kept me wrapped up in him, and for some reason i invested most of my time worrying about him even though i was deeply struggling (still am) with the fact that my father is an alcoholic and all these mental illnesses i left untreated. i am codependent and am absolutely addicted to the idea of love. 
we would write love letters and cling onto eachother any time we could. he knew i love writing, and he would write the most romantic shit. he knew all the right things to say, and i felt genuinely addicted to him. regardless of how much shit he was going thru, i was willing to harbor his pain. anytime he was upset or mad, i would be. i 
eventually the rehab caught on to this twisted relationship. so my therapist came up to me and said she needed to talk to me about him. so i was anticipating a private session where i could vent to her. 
next thing you know, J and i are being pulled out of group and brought into a room. with 3 therapists including my own, and a manager tech. this was an intervention gone wrong. i was humiliated by J’s therapist who used to be mine, only spoke to her for maybe 20 minutes while screwed up on ativan. she stated a private conversation and when i asked to leave after feeling very triggered and bawling crying she called me a “scared little girl”, J corrected her &amp;amp; said “young woman”. another reason for me to cling onto him, he defended me, not most people do. 
i felt emotionally vulnerable and destroyed in that office. in front of J. he was angry and they left me with my primary therapist, who i will call C. she spent 2 hours convincing  me to stay by saying “well they will stop bothering the two of you, just like each other from a distance, maybe you can have a relationship then”. brought him into the office to have a therapy session with us, where he told me he wanted to be with me but needed to focus on himself, so i did my best to leave him alone, in this small ass facility where it was impossible to completely avoid him. But J’s way of caring was so toxic. constantly withdrawing attention and pulling me back in. i consistently and persistently tried to be a good friend and gave him non stop support. but the tugging on my emotions as well as my addiction to him, made me go crazy. 
they put me on 4 diff medications so the side effects were messing me up physically; horrible tremors, loss of appetite, bathroom issues. i went into a bad depression and isolated myself for the rest of my stay there. i couldn’t be around him, he was in every one of my dreams and i was using drugs in those dreams. 
every time we went near eachother, techs ran over to us. rightfully so. they knew we were both breaking emotionally. i, however, was gaslit into thinking that this was my fault. by other people and himself. i took on that guilt and shame while watching him continue to grow, even though i wanted to cry every time i saw him. 
we planned out a future together while abusing drugs, i was completely consumed by him. i was seen as the girl who couldn’t “focus on herself”, i was too empathetic so to speak. 
i eventually started believing in god, and grew close to nature. i started to grow as a person and pulled myself out the depression. he’d blame me for him being aloof, saying i never participated in group and didn’t care to learn about his past thru groups. i didn’t know how to tell him that i couldn’t be around him. it was so emotionally damaging, it was like he was the only person in the room when i’d go to groups. i know he needs love and support, and i did my absolute best without manipulation or any agenda. i truly cared for his well being. still do. the addict in me, however, didn’t. i selfishly wanted to still communicate with him and he his friend. and i’d slip up and flirt with him bc i liked him a lot. 
like i said, he knew what to say to me and how to keep me emotionally attached while also ignoring me around people and saying hurtful things to me. when i reciprocated that energy, he’d twist it to make me look horrible. i ended up resenting him for it, but mostly resenting myself. 
i still feel like a big part of this is my fault, yet we share the blame. i expected a lot from him, stuff he wasn’t ready to give to me. so i went against our arranged plans to be together in PHP, i was broken. i needed to get away from him, and stop allowing the manipulation to continue. i chose a different facility, got close to other women and grew as a person despite my addiction to him which still exists unfortunately. 
i completed the program despite trying to leave AMA and he ultimately convinced me to stay (along with 15 other people which included techs who work there). i thank him for that, though. i still deeply care about his well being and fantasize about us. it feels like withdrawal, we kissed right before i left, our last kisses felt devastatingly amazing. something for me to fixate on, i stayed codependent to avoid my deepest darkest regrets and issues. to move past a relationship that broke me.
now i’m in a sober living situation, away from him. i wrote him a text, but he’s still in rehab. i feel guilty and shameful i still like him. i want this to stop, and i put myself in a completely diff situation from him, to focus on myself. but i fear i may run into him again. since these rehabs are kinda friends with each other. 

i kept his contact so i didn’t have to let him go. 

it feels like gods timing was right, for me to leave and move on. i feel happier and yet i’m still stuck in this addiction to him. i mean atleast it’s not the drugs, but i pray to god i get over him so i can truly live my life as a happy sober person... i never wanna repeat my mistakes. 
i live with strong minded women, who treat me like their own. i have a positive space to cry, and i feel safe. i only feel unsafe when he’s in my head.

Please help.","I apologize for the length of this post 😓 not including a tl;dr but the first paragraph is just background, the last two are the main points.

I'm 24 years old and I've been battling opiate addiction since I was 19. First pills, then I moved on to sniffing heroin. In January of 2018 I went to treatment in Florida and completed PHP and IOP and stayed clean for five months, but I definitely wasn't ready (I mainly stayed clean for my family's sake and my boyfriend at time, who ended up cheating on me and ending things a month before my relapse.) I went back out down there with a girl who was my roommate in halfway, and within a week of my relapse I graduated to IV use. Tried going back to treatment a few weeks after and left after a week. After I left treatment I met a guy who was also in active heroin addiction, and due to pressure from my family I went back to my home state a couple months later and he came with me. They thought I was clean, but we both continued using for the next two years. Fast forward to May of this year. My boyfriend and I were driving and I nodded out behind the wheel and crashed my car into a light pole. An onlooker calls the cops, I get a DUI and we are both arrested for posession and paraphernalia. Ten days after our arrest we make the decision to go to treatment because our court date is approaching and we can't successfully kick on our own. We go to a 90 day program, complete it, and go to independent sober living homes.

I don't understand why my self esteem is in the toilet and I can't figure out how to be happy sober. My boyfriend is happy. Despite the fact that we were using together we have a very loving, healthy relationship and he has never done anything to hurt me or put me in bad situations due to our using. He treats me wonderfully. He is making friends, and is all about AA and HA meetings and working a program even though he was resistant to it at first. He used for much longer than me (close to 10 yrs) and says he never wants to go back and just wants to try something different and find a new way to live. I got a sponsor and tried working a program in Florida, got to step 8, and still couldn't shake the urge to use. I have depression, PTSD, GAD, and social anxiety, and have a stutter that i've had since I was a little girl. Nowadays it only comes out when I get nervous and self conscious about it, but when I'm sober I'm self conscious about it constantly; dope took the fear away and I rarely stutter when I'm using. I try to hide it around new people that I want to be friends with, and when I try it just gets worse. Sharing in meetings is literal hell for me and it always has been. 

All I want is to be happy in sobriety and live a productive life, have a family, do all the things I wanted to do before years of my life were lost due to drugs and depression. I feel myself slipping back into the mental relapse state I was in before I went back out in Florida. My freedom and my future depend on me staying clean and it's not even enough to keep me from wanting to put a needle in my arm...i feel like I'm never going to get out of this hole that I'm in.

I'm not sure if I believe I am, I've had that question in the back of my mind before but I don'tthink I'm a drug addict., Said every addict ever.. lol but really, I don't feel like I am one. 

I'm just going to randomly talk, as my brain is scattered. I have a slight weed problem but I use weed to make myself eat and sometimes be more social, funny, less anxious, I know a crutch right? But I want to get my med card but I want to be a medical professional but the career I want would never allow any substance that alters judgment involved. 

I'm basically engaged to a recovering addict. I love him, but he's never forced his drug of choice on me. We smoke weed and sometimes socially drink. I used to black out drink and end up in ERs at parties and my hotel stays. I would always create drug cocktails, like alcohol,  Adderall, and caffeine and weed, this was in high-school, not so much now but it has happened.. 

I have more control over my blackout drinking now. I know I have a history of substance abuse. 

I do have some recreational habits... I dabble in everything but hard drugs like meth, crack, heroin, ketamine. But I've tried everything else. Like LSD, x, Molly, shrooms, weed/wax, edibles, pills, coke, alcohol, lean. 

I dabble in drugs socially and never do certain drugs unless its free /offered. 

But I never waste my money on certain drugs besides weed. But even then I allow myself only 2grams of wax a week or every 2 weeks depending on my budget. The conversation came up because my moms friend offered to give me 100 for a deposit on a place, but said that I couldn't have it till there was a place and she could hand it in herself because she doesn't want me wasting it on drugs or anything else. I was telling my mom this and she said well you are a drug addict. 

I don't know I love experimentation and altering the mind for reasonable periods of times. And drugs abuse is drug abuse but I don't think I'm an addict. 

I have some issues every now and then. Conflictions sometimes I don't take care of myself and what not but its not all the time. I have rare moments like that but I'm not sure if it is enough to seek help with or what ever. 

I used to self harm everyday as well. It became addicting now I battle with not doing it as often and still happens but not everyday anymore. I used to take drugs to increase pain tolerance and to stop myself from eating. My eating habits are still affected by some use but idk.",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4725679}"

I won't say which party or state because we're all addicts and I think we should be united in that and not squabbling over politics. I will say though, that the party I work for is the minority in the state. Every year we work so hard. I put in 90 hour weeks in 2018 and didn't take a day off for three months, and we still lost nearly every seat. Now, I'm a bit higher up, and seeing this whole political system from the inside, in combination with COVID, riots, and the general level of fucking insanity that our country is reaching lately, is fucking breaking me.

I use kratom every day, three times a day. That's been going on for a little over two years. Now I'm using poppy seed tea once a week as well. The kratom gets me high sometimes, but it's the poppy seed tea I really crave. And, honestly, I'm sitting here wondering why the fuck I shouldn't order more. Why the fuck shouldn't I get as high as possible every day? The world is shit, what am I missing out on? 

I should also say that my life isn't as bad as I may be portraying it. I have a decent paying job, and a significant other that I love with all my heart and who is absolutely the kindest person I've ever met. But still, even with some security and plenty of support, I just can't handle the day sober. I love poppy seed tea because it gets me high for the whole day. Why the hell shouldn't I be high all day every day? Why the fuck wouldn't I switch over to heroin once my tolerance is too much for PST? 

I just don't want to be part of the world anymore. I don't want to be part of politics or society. I just want to take my SO and my cats and live as far away from other people as possible, because I've lost my faith in humanity. It's been this same shit all the way back. Powerful people fighting for more power on the backs of the less powerful. 

The drugs are my way of simulating an escape from society, and the world at large. I drink my tea and suddenly I'm unbothered by it. I don't care, and I'm content to just play tony hawk all day. Why can't I have that all the time? What am I saving myself for? A miserable life of working until I die at the office at 90? What the fuck is the point of it all, of even trying? 

I'm sorry for the rant, and that I'm putting so much negativity out there, I just can't put on a brave face anymore. I hope that you're having a better day than I, and that you find the strength that I can't. Thanks for reading.",71,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8323055}"

Today marks one year since I broke the chains that bound me for so long. Everyone has their own standards for sobriety, and for me it was to make it to the one-year mark. I don't have any illusions about recovery and I know that my battle isn't over, that recovery is a life-long journey, and that I need to stay vigilant and guard myself against the potential of relapse.

It took a long time for me to realize that I had a problem and many more years of trying and failing to live a clean life. At many points along my journey I felt like I was free, only to have the rug pulled out from under me and to fall down again. Each time I fell it was worse than the previous worst time.

I hated myself more than anything and prayed for God to take my life away. I felt like I had become a monster, that I was worthless and didn't deserve to exist.

I didn't understand what the addiction was, and why it was in my life, but now I know. Now I know how strong I am.

I learned not to be overconfident, and that temptation is always waiting around the corner—that it strikes just when you think you have it under control, but I'm not afraid anymore, because I'm not waiting for it to come like I used to, instead I'm trusting in my own strength to face it and overcome it.

If you are struggling, please believe in your own ability to change! Whatever habits you've learned can be unlearned—and new habits can be adopted. Track your progress, be kind to yourself if you have a setback, and celebrate all of your successes! Addiction takes up so much of our lives, so if you get clean make sure that you put something helpful and healthy in its place. Build yourself back up with a strong foundation, a diverse and multi-faceted system of support, and healthy habits.

I get them prescribed (currently 30mg diazepam everyday (they wanted to increase to 40mg diazepam/day). But between speaking to my doctor I believe the whole mental health system is keeping me in there only because of benzos / my absolute dependency on them.

(A little backstory so you get the full picture: I was in crisis mental health care for being suicidal and enormously unstable and I had PTSD. But the waiting list for all the treatments took months after months after months, so they started me on a low dosage of lorazepam, to keep me from killing myself. But I could only get real treatment after more than 2 year of waiting and having been moving from home ->mental hospital->home->mental hospitals.

It started with lorazepam, then it became one after the other more and combinations and more and different ones. Super high dosage per day for months after the other)

If they just can get me off the benzos I believe I will me be able to live normally again. My dependency on benzos is only pulling me deeper into the world of never ending psychiatry instead of living an actual life. I told my doctor today, he's new in the team.. He said he would discuss my theory with the psychiatrist and he will call me wednesday.

In the meantime I have been microdosing weed in order to NOT takte the extra 10mg diazepam I prescribed. And micro-dosing weed does genuinely work for me, I don't get high or stoned, I am finally able to start living again.

Any tips? Similar situations? I don't have any friends that I can talk to about this, but it's been hard realizing this. Does this happen more often?

But I’ve been down this road before..,"Quick backstory: I’m a 20 year old guy from New England. I’ve been overdoing it since 14. At first was just like being a normal popular partying teen. Smoking weed, drinking, etc. parties. I was always fairly popular and hung out with older kids, at 15 I tried a bunch of different stuff: coke, acid, xans, pain pills, molly, etc. I had lots of phases, some very normal and some VERY bad. I went to the university of Kentucky when I graduated at 17, and was drinking WAY too heavy, but that was building up for about 18 months. I was drinking in class, after classi, blacking out at every party, which was every Thurs/Fri/Sat. Dropped out after a semester and came home. Didn’t drink for 3 months! Then I started getting back into coke and for the last 2 years I’ve been very heavy on it. At one point it was about 9g a week every day. Then I lost all my money my job and quit for like 3 months. I was selling lots of weed beforehand and that’s how I always afforded it. Then after like 3 months I got back into it and went for about 8 months pretty hard. 4-6 times a week. Same story, lost job lost income etc etc. I moved In February a couple states over to live with my dad, so I could stop paying rent and try to also get a grip. Oh, I should add I’ve had legal trouble since 18. 4 arrests but I beat them all except the current one I’m facing. So I’ve been going to individual rehab counseling once a week and therapy (which I’ve been doing therapy since 11) and all this. I reconciled with my longtime girlfriend and some family, and got a decent job (16/hour + commission and a manger role of a sales team) but every time I go home (for court or not) I go on like a crazy bender and blow all my money sometimes up to $1000. And the thing is, I never want to stop till I’m post bender with no dopamine or money and a lot of anxiety. But give it 2 days of me back at work back in NH, back at the gym and feeling okay and I’m like “oh I can’t wait to go home again I’m fine it’s just an occasional thing.” How do I make myself want to stop for good? Like I just don’t WANT to fully quit. I’m scared to never feel that way again, to never fee that rush and that fun and that idk I guess everything about it again. I WANT to WANT to stop. Any advice?

Also I’m not sure if this is relevant, but addiction runs in my family. Every guy has been an alcoholic, my dad still is one (he’s who I live witt and that’s why him and my mom Split a few years ago, but he’s high functioning.) my brother overdosed on kitchen floor from Oxy when I was 11, he was 24.

Gonna bring this up to my substance abuse counselor later in the week.

I'm engaged to a wonderful woman. She struggles with anxiety and depression, and ended up taking the semester off (we're 22).

I'm in university and I visit her every weekend or two. I keep going sober while we're apart and I can focus on myself, but when I visit her I always relapse (kratom and extremely high dose phenibut).

I think it may be the stress of wanting so badly to make her happy; I don't wanna be having mood swings from withdrawal or ""boring.""

She's hella supportive. She quit alcohol in solidarity with me (she isn't an alcoholic, but when she gets really drunk she becomes a terrible partner tbh: telling me my roommate is sexy, emotional wreck, etc.). In the past, before she quit drinking, we've enabled each other's substance use occasionally by agreeing we could each use our DOC sometimes when we're hanging. We realized we were enabling one another and don't do that anymore!

Anyway, I think I may be struggling with some social anxiety (wanting to please her, to ""act normal,"" and to relax with kratom) and perfectionism (I have to be perfect for her and all that). How can I approach this? Do I have to stop seeing her until I can figure it out? Thanks, with love ❤️

2020-09-19 10:08:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ivt64c/starting_a_new_job_and_going_cold_turkey_from/,Starting a new job and going cold turkey from weed and alcohol?,"Im 26. Im addicted to weed (Since 14), alcohol(since 20ish) (at the same time) and over the last few years a third thing aswell (im a polyaddict), so at a time it was weed alcohol and cocaine, then it was weed alcohol and Fentanyl (which is worse than heroin).

A few months ago I seeked help, and my drug worker made a plan with me where I switch the Fentanyl to Subutex (Espranor) which I take once a day, and then I carry on drinking and smoking as normal while I make that transition, and then we look at getting me into an alcohol detox.

Unfortunately, at this same time, I cant afford to keep drinking, I cant even afford rent, so Ive had to look for work aswell.

Unexpectedly this morning I was offered a job starting monday, 2 days of walking for 10 hours, a 1 day break, 2 more days on, then the weekend off.

My drug worker has advised that I drink a little before work and on my breaks to keep the withdrawls away, which is probably what Ill have to do from the start anyway. It also not possible for me to just go and get a ""detox"" like many people say.. it costs over £1000 in my country which I cant afford and my drug worker has said the NHS doesnt fund rehabs or detoxs anymore, so something like has and always will be out of the question for me. If I could go to rehab tomorrow I would for certain, but its not possible in my country and my situation financially. No rehab here offers repayment schemes either.

My question is.. I have had the odd day where money hasnt come through until 10am, and even being sober until 10am makes me start shaking, sweating, feeling nausious  and throwing up, ect, but at the same time the only thing that seemed to help was getting up and doing something as a distraction, since all I do normally is watch tv and feed my addictions, so Ive been sititng here all day panicking that ""SHIT hows my body going to adjust within 2 days"", but maybe at the same time it will help that for 10 hours on my first day cold turkey I will have stuff to do all day? At the same time I worry that my withdawl symptoms may be clear to other people at work, and thats also a major worry to me?

So its really this choice between going cold turkey at home (due to lack of money anyway) and going mad with nothing to do, or going cold turkey-ish and using this 10 hour a day job as a distraction. Im just not sure if my body can even handle it.

During this last 2 months of switching from Fentanyl to Subutex ive got myself into a routine of having my subutex after I have a 9% 500ml beer at 9am,  and then having 2 of those by 11am, and by the end of the day consuming an equively to 1 litre of whiskey nearly. Its going to be such a massive drastic change to my body and cycle, but at the same time I think it could also be a good thing.. maybe its the only way to force myself out of this routine ive created.

I start the job on monday, its saturday now. I have been smoking 10+ spliffs per dayfor many years but im on the last one I can afford right now, so from that will be cold turkey on weed. With alcohol I can afford to have some in the  morning and on my breaks at work, Just to keep the withdrawls away but even that is going to be a massive shock to my body

If im honest, this lifestyle ive created for myself where I am only happy on 3 substances from the moment I wake up, yet Have nothing to do all day and feel incapable of doing anything, is so horrible, and ive been terrified about how I might not be able to do end it, maybe throwing myself into the deep end and working again will snap me out of this nonsense. Maybe just utilizing myself as a human and getting up and walking and working will distract and help me to not be dependant on sitting down getting high and drinking? I maybe couldve used a bit more time to adjust though.. at the moment I dont even sleep right, I sleep for 2 hours then wake sleep again  all night long until I give up

I guess im just very scared, and not sure how my body will react, so thats why im venting a little. Any advice or anything would be great and thanks for listening",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7311674}"

27 yo female. I have a great job, ok social life (covid) and moved to a new city almost a year ago. 

I’m having issues deciphering whether I have an alcohol or coke problem - which seems silly now that I’m typing it out for the world to give me advice. I’ve been thinking about it a lot lately, as I can’t even have a sip of wine or beer without having to call my guy. My brain can’t even fathom thinking of anything else. 

I’ve always been the “fun friend” to everyone - no real close relationships (ie best friends) but a lot of different acquaintances, so I always have plans on the go. I almost feel pressured by my friends to keep up my “fun friend” title, which makes me anxious to even tell them that I’m trying to better myself for fear of ridicule. 

I work in an industry (restaurant) where constant drinking is normalized. It’s my career - I love it and I will never leave, but how do I try to better myself? Even the restraint to say no or go home after work. Like I said, I don’t have close friends, so this is the only way I get to socialize outside of work in a new city. 

As title says, I don’t know what I am. I’d appreciate feedback from anyone who was once in this limbo to let me know what they did to start making big steps forward.  Does that mean the alcohol is the issue or the cocaine is the issue?",1,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42370877}"

That other thing was first ketamine, but then i twas cocaine which ruined my life and then I switched that for fentanyl, which was almost just as bad in a different way.

I decided to change many time, and it always fails, but this time, Ive gone through my drug and alcohol worker and we have switched my fentanyl for Subutex. So every morning at 10am I need to take 16mg of subutex in order to feel normal all day... hes also told me to keep my drinking the same while I do this becuase its a tough transition.

Over the last 2 months, Ive managed to come completely off of fentanyl and onto this subutex, but still been drinking from morning till night. Some days I dont get money until 10am and even that having to be sober for 3 hours makes me shake, sweat, feel sick and dizzy, its horrible. My physical dependancy on it has got so bad now.

At the same time, here i am at home alone with no job, hobbies, girlfrend or friends thanks to the drugs, so you can imagine how eager I am to get back to work. I also have rent to pay and bills and loans ect, so Ive been applyin  for jobs, and I just got one in a warehouse. I asked for 1 week to get myself ready but they want me to start this monday, and its saturday now.

So now I have this whirpool of panick.. my drug worker said I should drink in the morning before work and then on my breaks, but I know from past jobs that that just doesnt work.. and then during my whole working time if ive had a drink after Ive woken  up then Ill be dying to leave and have another all day, and ontop of that even if I have a small drink in the morning before work, my body is literally used to drinking 2 9% 500ml beers every morning before 10am, so for such a sudden change to happen over 2 days I  genuinely dont how my body will react.

I also am unable to just change the time that I take my subutex, it will result in my waking up at a random point in severe withdrawls if I do.

I honestly dont feel my body is going to be able to adjust to this within 2 days.. I asked for a weeks notice but wasnt possible, so then it becomes a choice, I can either give it a try and see what happens or literally go back to having no purpose in life and nothing at all to do ever and no money coming in ect

Ive been drinking this level for years now, and on this occasion with lockdown a swell its become a very regimented thing, has anyone done anything like this themselves making such a drastic change so fast?

If im having 30 units per day, then I could have 15 tomorrow and only 7 on my first work day, but by doing that the withdrawls I get will be almost unbearable, and might even be noticable to my employer

And ontop of all the drug and alcohol issues, Ive also been sitting on my ass all day for months now, so to suddenly go from that to 10 hours of solid walking through a warehouse, whilst going through withdrawls.. Any tips?

I have had this issue with co-codamol since I came to uni. I was prescribed it as a kid and had it again at the age of 19 for a pain I had at the time. At that point I was struggling with uni and I realised in taking a couple of 30mg’s during my lecture made me feel at ease. So I continued that for few years solid. (My GP for some reason never questioned the constant prescription requests.

For 4 years I was on and off with it. I’d realise that as I have a chronic illness (T1 Diabetes) , I should be looking after my body, but then I get into situations where I need to feel chill and focus to get things done. So 5 years later I’m relying on it to get me through the afternoons at work and to get me to sleep at night (since I left uni this has been the case) . Lockdown was really good for me as I was away from the pharmacy and I was on furlough so I found other things to make me feel good (early morning runs, baths, wholesome activities). I’ve been back at work for a couple of months now and when I’m nearing the end of a packet I’m getting stressed that I’m going to run out.. and planning my excuses to go to the pharmacy so my boyfriend doesn’t find it suspicious. 

My worry isn’t the codine itself, it’s the paracetamol element... and the concern for what long term use could do to my organs. I have about 8 tablets a day... which is still technically within the guidelines but I take them in 2 doses. 4 tabs twice a day.  

Like. I get that this isn’t the most serious addiction issue ever, but I think I’m coming to terms with the fact that it’s not normal and not healthy.

any way. i am the same cold broken human that went to jail last week and came out with 

enough determination to pour out my alcohol. it wasnt me that really made that decison. 

of course no one ever gets sober because someone tells them to. you have to want it, and 

truth be told i may be the first person to ever get sober against their own will but it 

wasnt forced upon them. i am not in rehab. i am not in jail. there will be no court order

im tired. im tired of waking up, im tired of getting out of bed, im tired of not being

ablt to function even slightly. id rather have a lobotomy, because at that point i wouldnt

care. i dont want to feel anymore. Alcohol is the only thing that has ever made my life

seem worth living that doesnt have a heartbeat. maybe ill make it

I recalled something about the people we talked about in my first letter. i never once

considered spanking to be abuse, and i understand that there can be spanking without abuse

when i lived with my cousins who i had been brainwashed into thinking were my aunt and

uncle. they would spank me alot on top of the other horrible things that ive already

mentioned. it wasnt like a simple hand on the ass or a belt. sometimes it was but they 

would hold the belt by the buckle and not fold it, essentially using it like a whip

while i was standing. they would have me ""pick a switch"" (for those of you who didnt grow

up in the south that means to go pick a tree limb or something similar) it had to be a 

perfect switch or you would be i so much more trouble. eventually as children you try to

find some way out of recieving that much pain. there were several times that they werent

happy with my choice, and they would do one of a few things to demonstarte their anger

one time they took one of their daughters studded belts to me in the middle of the kitchen

while they laughed and filmed and told me to dance. another time they locked me in a closet 

for the remainder of the day and night. the worst and most humiliating of all was the time

my ""aunt"" went to a rose bush and picked a very long wide limb. she clipped off JUST the

tips of the spikes, and proceded to run me in circles around the kitchen telling me to 

dance. they loved filming these things. as if they were home videos that one day we 

would all laugh about. well i dont need a video, i know what they did. i can see it

very clearly. they would only film times when i was crying because i couldnt understand 

why they were doing what they were doing. In fact we used to have sunday dinners at their 

mothers house, and i was never allowed to consent to what was put on my plate. there was

one week where they put too much on my plate, and i wasnt allowed to leave the table 

until it was all gone. i managed to put down everything except the collard greens. 

i have never liked collards, and i was so full i thought i would throw up. i asked

to be excused and they told me not until i finished. i remember i begged and begged. 

i wasnt allowed to use the restroom, they took my drink away, and after hours of this

torture i was crying and kicking, and 6 adults laughed and tooka a video of it.

just a touch more trauma to add to the mix. 

&#x200B;

the last time i got sober was very brief and truth be told i relapsed so hard that i 

cant even remember how long it was. only a few weeks. i was changing jobs, i had 

recently been given the news that even if i make these changes like being sober, eating

healthy, reducing my stress... that unfortunately i only stand to live another 5 years,

and even in those years the quality of my life will go downhill. i tried to be sober, and 

then one day like a pile of brick it hit me. whats the point in living the last few years

of your life fighting to not do the thing that makes you so happy? why fight for something

that may or may not ever benefit you anyway. this is the kind of thinking live with. 

i may never have kids, and if i do it is very likely i wont live to see the graduate

middle school let alone highschool, or walking them down the aisle, or any of that 

shit that everyone fantasizes about when thinking of starting a family. Pursuing a 

relationship at all would be selfish knowing that im gonna die soon. my attitude shifted

around to ""Fuck it!""

&#x200B;

2020 has been an absolute nightmare. my fiance who id been with for five years left. 

my brother moved out. a global pandemic took my job and locked me in the apartment i lived

with my brother and fiance in for 76 fucking days. no human contact for 76 fucking days. 

just me, a gallon a day, and doordash. it was a completely lifechanging experience in no 

good way. i would routinely wake up in my floor. sometimes with a bottle poured out on the

floor beside me, sometimes in a puddle of my own blood and vomit. sometimes id wake up in 

my car with no keys to be found. i was crying and screaming so much that my neighbors 

tried to check on me regulary despite the pandemic. i tried to kill myself 3 times. 

that makes my life total around 12. turns out im really bad at it. ive been almost

homeless 3 times, one of my best friends who just happened to be the same age as me, and

have the same name died of a heart attack in his work parking lot. i had a psychotic break

i started hallucinating that he and cooper were following me around. we had conversations

they cracked jokes, and scared me around corners. they wouldnt leave. this went on for 

months... im an insane person drinking his life away with psychological issues that

would probably see me committed to a hospital. maybe ill write more later. my ears are

starting to ring.

I always loved video games and I loved chasing that feeling that I got from playing video games, eating candy, and watching tv shows. As I got older I started getting addicted tonplaying basketball, paintball, skateboarding, football, etc. As I got older that turned into smoking weed, drinking, etc. 

Nowadays I've just been trying to figure out what is wrong with me. Maybe it’s just a substance abuse problem and I have underlying conditions. I know for a fact that I’m major depressive and have generalized anxiety. I stopped getting treated years ago because nothing was helping. The issue was that I wasn’t being 100% honest and I waited too long to get a therapist. My psychiatrist gave me drugs that made everything worse. At this point in my life I’m ready to take all the problems on and talk about my life and finally get to a point where I can get off the things I’m addicted to. Right now it’s phenibut, fasoracetam, testosterone (currently quit smoking weed and doing concentrates), but I’m still using the legal alternative delta 8 and hemp sometimes. I guess I just made this point to say hey guys this is me and I’ve been on phenibut for a couple years straight and added fasoracetam and the doctor got me on testosterone which was a bad move(I’m 24). I’m still the same person even though a lot has changed with me. That’s why I’ve had such a hard time. I’m finally going back to get help and soon enough I’ll be a new me I hope.

After a few days the scene of the porn (where a guy is slamming the shit out of the shemale (trangender/ladyboy) started to come up in my mind it kind of started to kick in, So when my parents went on a trip, i Opened the transexual porn again and i watch it till hours (because been home alone) and finally after watching shit tons of transexual porn, I finally ejaculated.
so the transexual porn became my type of porn now this is where i started to watch it regularly and i even felt disgusted by it, but you know how porn grasp the brain. Si after watching transexual porn for like 11-12 months i felt the same way i felt when i was watching straight porn, I didn't got boner even watch 5-6 videos at a session.
Then i experimented (which was again huge mistake) I saw a video where shemale (transexual/ladyboy) fucks the men and that was something new to me and the same cycle repeated, and i started to become beta male.
While watching shemale porn i started to watch homosexual porn where i fantasies about beings the bottom (submissive) guy and watched tons of gay and shemale porn for 1 year, I didn't not got boner while having sex with a my girlfriend which led to breakup after few month because of lack of intimacy and after a while i was watch porn and i read comments on the pornhub about the subreddit called nofap and he mentioned it in a way that hit me, so just out of curiosity i downloaded reddit and followed nofap and started to read about nofap and its benefits, I realised what in a big hole i am in and the hole where i am stuck was created non other than Me.
So this is me after 3 months of No pmo But i peeked today but to control myself i started to write my journey, ahh yes i am 19 years old and for the people who are new, Yes the benefits are real and i started to get attracted to Girls (for me which is really awesome) I had few wet dream and i still get few thoughts/urges about Transexual porn but i have now strength to control myself And sorry for such a long post and i am ending this post (because my urge is gone 😁) By thanking you all for post such profound stories and in depth knowledge of retention and love you guys(not in a gay way 😂).

&#x200B;

I forgot to post this and just continued writing today 

&#x200B;

I started a new job today.

I am just a line cook again, not a manager, not a chef, not an unemployed waste of space. 

i had to hide the witdrawls from my new co workers and found that i actually know a few 

people there from highschool. it was the easiest first day ive ever had. 

Just working fryers. Its an odd feeling to step all the way back down the ladder. 

Its even weirder to do it by choice. 

Well i guess the whole point of this weird open letter things is to analyze the choices.

Im not good at making rational decisions outside of a kitchen. theres something about

the chaos of it. its really stressful at times and forces me to be around a lot more 

people who are like me but arent ready to get better, BUT when i have the muscle memory

and im on a line with all of those tickets pouring in dancing my way around hot pans 

and people moving quickly, on slippery floors. The noises, the communication. The 16 

austin symphony shuts up. its chaos manifesting peace. it scares me though because its

the reason i ended up this way apart from my own actions, and some other things we have

or will discuss. Between the ages of 16 and 20 i never drank. I hated alcohol to be 

more precise. i wouldnt have a beer with anyone or a shot for any reason. Hell, 

I didnt even want to go to the bar for my 21st because i dont like drinking. 

My brother and sister insisted i had one drink at their favorite bar. It turned out to be

my favorite too. Im sure had they known where id be at now they wouldnt have persisted and

if i did i wouldnt have been so complicit. for a while it was just a bottle of tequila 

every couple or few weeks and my fiance would help me here and there with it. eventually

it became a couple beers after work and then tequila at home. fast forward a year and

im in a new job, and one day im hungover and the general manager offers me a beer. i 

laughed and said ""i would never drink at work!"" She then poured me a beer anyway it was

a sour too. My favorite! So i drank it. i said just this one. but then again im pretty

 bad at that. so fastforward again. at the time of my leavingi was having shots before

work at my bedside, in the car on the way there, beers at work, hitting the bar after,

drinking until i enevitably pass out in bed by my fiance, who at this point was tired 

of not really ever seeing me. We break up. 4 years almost... gone. This moment was a 

bad turning point for me. i immediately started sleeping with every person that wanted me

i was just lucky enough that that was everyone that i wanted. the bottles got bigger and

dried up faster. i had started a third shift job on salary that only required 5 hours a 

day and i was making around 25 an hour depending. so i had 5 hours of work and 

3-4 hours of sleep. living alone, single, partying constantly, sleeping with anyone i 

could. an empty hollow existence. a dopamine factory running on high alert almost 

every second of every day. Anyone who has lived like this for a long enough amount of

time knows that it is a hollow meaningless existence. no real affection to be had, no 

sense of real accomplishment. you lose friends, and dissapoint your family, and all the 

while slowly damaging your body, sometimes permanently. this led pretty quickly to a

very deep depression. i already struggle with almost crippling social axiety, manic

depression, and bi polar disorder, but it got BAD. i started to cry when my hookups left

i missed my ex, i hated my job, i felt completely invalid and useless as i started to 

realize that none of the people in my life wanted anything to do with ME it was just

an ends to a mean. i ended up meeting a girl, and even she wanted an open relationship.

That wasnt a bad idea because of the way i wanted to sleep around, but she also was living 

the same hollow existence i was. drugs, alcohol, parties, promiscuity, BPD, anxiety, and

manic depression. we worked at the same place as well. im sure you could assume pretty

quickly that this was a very toxic relationship. i had no idea what i had gotten myself 

into. Shortly into this relationship we had started drinking together before during and 

after work. we started fighting because of our open status, but refused to change it.

And eventually.... she started hitting me during our arguments, during sex, at work....

I NEVER hit her once. I dont have it in me. i continued this for a few months before

i decided it was over. this is also the story of the first time i got sober. I gave

her all of her belongings back, took my ass beating and she left. i kept drinking.

I started seeing my ex again. I kept drinking. we got back together and one day i 

woke up and just didnt want it. i felt as if i had found some meaning in life past

the bottle and my life began getting better. I know this whole thing is a bit 

jarring if youre actually reading it but im just talking out what got me to the

shitty place im in. i was sober for 16 weeks. the longest ive been since i turned 21.

its funny how no matter how good youre doing life can get really bad really fast. 

I had a friend named cooper. he was a great guy, and we didnt see eachother regularly, 

but i loved the guy. we had plans to hang out one weekend around our work schedules. 

it wasnt like him to call and make weekend plans because we both work in the industry,

but i always try to take the opportunity to see friends. we made those plans on 

wednesday the week before. ive never made plans that far away from the day. on the sunday 

after we made the plans i was at my job and we were VERY busy. he called me, and i didnt

answer because to be honest i didnt even hear it ring. a couple hours later i go outside

to smoke and his mom calls me. I still havent checked my phone. i answer the phone to her

frantically crying and asking me why i didnt answer. i told her to calm down and tell

me what happened. Turns out cooper shot himself with a 357 magnun in the head a few

minutes after hanging up. before he did though... he left me a voicemail. it was an 

excerpt from a poem i wrote titled ""Babylon"" it goes as follows.

i couldnt go in the next day. 50 PBRs because it was his favorite, and all the tequila

my liver and stomach would let me handle till i passed out. i was a mess for a long time,

but i didnt stop drinking for even longer. over the course of the next 6 months 4 more 

of my friends died. suicides, overdoses, carwrecks... were out here dropping like flies

this much grief coupled with a very stressful environment like a detrimentally 

understaffed kitchen, and a failing relationship because i couldnt get my shit

together and stop bringing home a half gallon of montezuma everyday. i got worse again.

Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic hit us in April my boyfriend has discovered and promptly started to overuse sprayable sour candy bottles. We live two towns over from Janesville, WI where the bottles are produced and he has started buys them wholesale from there since he found out where they were made a couple weeks ago. 

Since April he went from a quarter of a bottle a day to at least 8 or 9. That is a ridiculous amount of sugar and I silently worry about his pancreas failing or something like that.

When I said something about his use a few days ago he proceeded to yell at me and call me a ‘naggy cunt’. He slammed the door on the way out and I knew he where he was headed. He was making a straight shot up Route 16 to Janesville.

Me and his parents, all six of them (they’re Mormons from somewhere outside of SLC) decided to stage an intervention, including nine of his ten siblings around sometime next month.

He used to be addicted to heroin and has been clean for a while. 

What might happen to him?

My brother is 32 years old and has struggled with alcohol for quite a few years. We grew up in a small town where there wasn’t much to do but drink so he started at 16 during parties. When he went to university it just kept getting worse. Initially it was deemed “normal” as it was during weekends at parties. But, as his friends started to stop drinking as much and moving on with their lives, he kept drinking the same amount. He became known for his drunkenness. 

It came to a head at a family wedding where he got extremely drunk and there was a blow out. He ran away from the family and ended up driving drunk. By the time we found out, he had returned. He asked for help so my parents paid for him to go to an expensive rehab. But, when he returned, he decided to still drink. For awhile it was still only on weekends and was labeled as binge drinking. 

Recently I think it has escalated. I think he’s becoming an all-the-time alcoholic. He admitted to drinking by himself last night so much that he couldn’t come visit to meet his nephew for the first time. He also ended up drunk on a previous call we had not long ago when he was by himself. I know a source is having found his best friend dead a few years back and also his lack of self esteem due to his life not being what he envisioned (did business degree, moved back with parents and had a job but not a career, just finished psychology degree and is back with parents and not able to find job in field, no relationships that I know of and all his friends are married and having kids). 

My question is how do I provide him support to help him overcome this. My family is pretty much done with it as he has had many opportunities to get help (parents willing to pay, knowledge on counselling, etc) and hasn’t done anything With it. Do I need to also let go and remember he’s a grown ass man making his own decisions?",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7626333}"

I just started using subs to get off fentanyl pressed 30s (Used for about 10months) but let me tell you how first . I have sickle cell so I’ve been getting Oxy from the doctors like candy for years . I used subs about 2 years ago to originally get off oxy ( just cutting 2-3 millimeters at a time whenever I felt the WDs coming ) and I got off them perfectly clean so this is where the fent comes in . I had an accident that put me in the hospital for 3 weeks which lead to me having to take oxy 30s again but a family member of mine would switch my real ones for the pressed ones , I KINDA noticed the change but didn’t officially find out until about 4-5 prescriptions later & I was getting 90 every 2 weeks so by that time I was fucked . It lead me into buying them because the WDs were such a beast that even my real oxys couldn’t fight it . Long story short after spending 1000s and losing so much including myself at times I said enough is enough and did what I felt was best to do . I checked in the ER ( acted like I was having the worst sickle cell crisis but really was WDs ) they admitted me & gave me 2mg of iv Dilaudid every 2hrs so my plan was to use iv meds as a trade to get off fent IT WORKED! The first 3 days were HELL but every dose came with a super relief . They kept me for about 2 week & sent me home with 30 5mg oxys which I took every time I felt WDs until they were gone ( tapering from the iv meds ) I’m currently 19 days from fent & 4-5 days from the oxy 5s , I have two Suboxone strips that I’m taking only 3-4 millimeters of when I feel WDs ( mainly body aches & mental ) so my question is will I build a tolerance with these two strips? And how many days until freedom? I also just took two Imodium pills about an hour ago because I read they help . Overall I’m beyond proud to be far away from the fent so if I have to deal with what’s left I will , just don’t want to prolong anything you know . I’d appreciate any feedback!

&#x200B;

Im back a little early. today has been a quiet day in my home, but incredibly loud in 

my mind. Im shaking and vomiting. the unsurmountable guilt of my actions over the course

of this past couple of years sounds like a 16 austin symphony just screaming to run back.

People tend to look for different things in drugs and alcohol. Johann Hari in his book

chasing the scream, (or his ted talk that is shorter) calls addiction bonding.

he talks about how all people have the inherent need to bond. Not just bonding to humans,

The need to create bonds with even actions, hobbies, and foods... or in mine and a lot of

others drugs and alcohol. This feels so significant to me because i can see the bonds 

ive broken or never had. i can see where when the flame of one bond got stamped out that

it was replaced by a stronger bond with my unhealthy coping mechanism. I dont know why im 

deciding to put this all up for people on reddit, but i think maybe it could help? Maybe

even help you? Ive always been very suicidal and when my friends and family would ask me 

why i drink so much i would chuckle and say, ""Well im gonna take the hardest route to the

easy way out."" ""I never had the balls to shoot myself anyway."" they all knew it wasnt a 

joke, but just cracked an uncomfortable smile, or hit me in the arm... The thing is that

i still dont want to live. I just dont wanna die badly enough to take my own life. some 

days i do, but i havent yet. so i say all of this to come back around to bonding. When

dealing with addicts its important to not demonize people, but rather try to find out

what it is that makes day to day life this unbearable. FInd reasons to not give up. 

Hari also mentions the rat park expirement as well. It all supports this undeniable

truth that every addict is missing something important to them. The bonds that make it 

worth it. i hope to find mine. Do you know what yours are? I used to practically live

outdoors, hiking swimming, rock climbing, playing sports with friends... I write music,

and poetry, and play video games. I love to cook, and fish, so I have interests, but

they just dont interest me anymore. as i fell further down the rabbit hole of my

addiction and depression, i have become anxious and home bodied. Too paranoid to go 

to the gas station for cigarettes some days. It doesnt help that 2020 has been so bad

but im gonna cover that tomorrow. thanks for reading. im glad i can put this stuff out

&#x200B;

I have seen, done, and had done to me so many bad things. so much in fact that it 

has, unfourtunately led me down a path of bad decision making. I've been beaten, sexually 

abused, told im worthless, felt worthless, acted worthless. Eventually living this way

starts to make you feel as if it will never get better. A sarcastic writer spiraling

downward head first the rock bottom. i like to think i havent made it that far, but im 

standing at the edge of the cliff. My mind screams at me to jump. This isnt poetry this

time, it is processing. Johann Hari's writing have given me at least an idea where to 

start but i never truly wanted to. The comforting burn and warmth i get from my crutch 

has never been an option in my mind. Give me stimulus or give me death. It runs in the

family unfortunately, these all seem like excuses but you really have to look inside 

and see why it hurts so bad you can't manage to be fully present in your life. My parents

play a big role. This may just be shifting blame, but i truly believe we are a product

of our raising and mine was pretty fucking bad. parents who fought and cheated on 

eachother. They were always so strung out or absent that my sister and grandmother

had to do most of the work. If it wasnt the other branches of our family that we were 

with while my father was in prison and my mom was so far down the rabbit hole that she

just left us on a doorstep. My brother and sister went to one family, and i went to 

another. These houses were not homes, and never truly safe. I cant speak on what 

happened to my brother and sister during that time. My time in this new setting lasted 

about two and a half years. i was sometimes starved, sometimes forced to eat regularly.

My caretakers would let their son hit me whenever he wanted to but if i fought back i was

grounded. being grounded was being locked in a room alone for the duration of it. 

two options, stare at the wall, or copy The Great Gatsby word for word. I may eat, i 

may not.just me a bed and the light from a window. They would physically hold me on the couch and

force me to watch horror movies, and then try to scare me with masks while i slept. 

they took all of my possesions other than clothes and gave them to their son.

If i got sick or was injured they wouldnt take me to a doctor. theyd patch me up and

put me back in my room. things didnt necessarily get any better after my dad got out 

of prison. I remember him forcing himself on me, though there is no proof that this isnt

some kind of trauma induced nightmare that turned into a memory in my fragile young mind. 

I think it lasted for years. When my uncle passed away its like he gave up and just

got more and more strung out. im surprised he is still alive. Hell, im surprised IM 

still alive. My uncle dying broke us all, he was an alcoholic just like me. He

was the greatest man i ever knew and i guess ive always wanted to be so much like him 

that that had to come with it. My mother didnt come around too much. Just enough to make

it never get easier. shed show up and promise us she was back for good. She would beg us

to spen time with her, and then one day just forget about us again. I even tell my 

siblings its okay, or that im just mad, or that i made it out fine. The truth is...

I havent been able to even tell myself this truth until right now. It fucking hurts 

me everyday. It is one of the biggest reasons why i feel so useless. I lie to people all

of the time because i just wanna be good enough for them. im a mess, i put myself down,

i intentionally make self destructive decisions, because i feel as if this is what

i was destined to be. Some people were just born to turn into nothing. If it had to be

one of us it would be me. it was always gonna be me. Katie and Chris are so good, its 

like living in the shadow of who you couldve been. Its like rolling that stupid fucking

ball up the hill over and over again. its like knowing no matter what you WILL fold again

so why try to sort it out at all. so thats day 1. this is gonna be a long journey.

Its gonna be a bigger fight than ive ever had to put up, and ive been fighting my whole

life. Something has to happen to push you over that edge before you make a change. 

i just hope that i dont push anyone else away. i cant lose them, id effectively lose

I was dependent on marijuana for about 3 months using it typically 5 to 7 days a week. The longest break I took off of it was 3 days over those 3 months.

I am only using marijuana once a week now to transition to being completely sober of the drug. I understand you cannot be physically addicted to marijuana, but I definitely felt psychologically addicted.

The one thing I long for I can never try again because you only get so many chances till you're deem you as a screw up and then people stop helping.The most painful part of my recovery was realizing how much I've hurt the ones I love and recognizing the significant damage I caused myself.  I must regain my strength living one day at a time I want to look in the mirror and not feel ashamed. As of right now I'm mortified to look in the mirror because all I see is a loser with a drug problem. Ive always had an addictive personality. It's one of those things that only gets worse when you find your drug of choice. In my case methamphetamine was my poison but at that time in my life anything was on the drug menu. Life was a dream until it became a nightmare. My destination was self-destruction for I hated myself so much I destroyed every last bit of myself till I was nothing.

this isn’t anybody’s business, and nobody cares, or maybe this isn’t the place. but i need something, somewhere. 
My sister has been an addict since she had her first son J. She was 18, her mom, and my father, our father, have been addicts since as long as anybody can remember. 
To make a long story short/ my sister fought her addiction for years, This final time, she got sober, two years. a year spent in jail, a few months in rehab, and then a year sober in the “real world” if youre an addict you understand why that matters. 
She had her son D before her final sobriety reign, her husband started using, and it triggered her, she always did what was right and sign custody away. 
She was doing so good, she had a boyfriend, a home, worked hard, 
She suddenly overdosed and died, on 09/11/2020.
I found her notebook, from jail and rehabs from 2019. She didn’t want anything but to be sober. to not be her mom. to let go of her mom. to fight. 
i don’t know what to do. i don’t know how to cope knowing she lost her fight to addiction. Somebody triggered her, she never relapsed alone, always a trigger. some girl named samantha this time i guess. her boyfriend was distraught, he’d left that night after fighting with her about relapsing. 
He came back and she was gone, i found out at 8 in the morning. i miss her, how do i cope? her funerals thursday. 
the front of her notebook says 

“Love is patient, love is kind, 
Love is doing what’s right and best. Motivation helps keep you sober. 
My heart J. and D. 
Her nephews name listed. Family first.”


she goes on in her notebook to explain her view, and it hurts, and i’m lost 

her drugs of choice started with meth, her piece of shit mom made her do it to heal her postpartum depression
next, herion.
In all her notes she says her sober support is what’s helping best, and that she struggles to ask for help.
Her boyfriend was a POS. I met him one night to ask him about himself to make sure he wasn’t abused, he then told me her addiction wasn’t my problem, and that she could do it alone. i don’t think he ever acknowledged it. He never told us she was using again, she started pain pills, and then xanax, and then she told him. she told him god told her to admit to her sins, he still didn’t tell us, even after she Oded on xanax (pressed probably) 
He found track marks, which meant herion was back. he fought her instead of telling us. i blame him for keeping it a secret, she couldn’t of been using more than a few weeks, maybe not even a month.",62,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.55524915}"

2020-09-13 17:06:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/is6rqw/dangerous_danger_addiction/,Dangerous danger addiction,"So i always loved explosives,radiation,toxic stuff and such when i was really young (i'm 14)

And i recently started doing dangerous things all the while looking for something even more dangerous.

It first started with frog torture,i would zap them with electricity using my dad's power supply to see what they would do.

Then i wanted to make a prison tattoo gun just to make it,it actually worked on an orange peel but i didn't give myself a tattoo.

After that i found out about uranium and i just needed to make a nuclear reactor no just joking there's no uranium where i live.

After that i was obsessed with guns. A lot. So i made a gun out of firecracker gunpowder and a metal pipe. It went well until i burned my thumb a bit while trying to light it. It's injury #1.

Then i started to set random things on fire,like cardboard or random paper scraps,anything i could get my hands on,my neighbor was actually making a huge pile of timber close to my house so i poured gasoline over it and it didn't light on fire cause it was humid that night.

I gave up with fire for a week or two.

During that time i started really liking rocket engines,so i schemed a plan to get to a local abandoned building to ""take"" a bunch of fire extinguishers so i can use them as tanks for rocket fuel i didn't have.

The building was locked,so the other day i took a blowtorch,planning to melt the metal door on the entrance to take my prized fire extinguishers *( i was at this building a while back with friends so i know the layout),*while trying to replace the empty propane canister,the propane splashed in my face,it stank a lot,the smell didn't go off for a couple days. 

I also learned that using that hho gas as rocket fuel would make a huge explosion,so my rocket fad died.

Then i made a hho generator for a school project *(i sent the teacher a photo of it cause quarantine)*,this hho gas is extremely explosive btw so i had fun with it,the power supply i used was still the one from my dad and it was getting really hot while it was making the gas so i stopped production.

Edit : During the making of the hho generator,i wanted to drill some metal plates. So i drilled and they started to spin and i cut my finger bad. Never have i ever bled so much than at that moment. It may sound dramatic but it was like a fist covered with blood level. I still have a scar from that incident. INJURY #2

Then i got the fire fad again and i wanted to make napalm to celebrate.And so i did,dissolving gasoline in styrofoam gets you napalm,i lit it a lot of times,having fun.

I got an idea!

What if i take a huge spoon and put napalm covered coal on it,set it on fire and throw it at someone's house?

I wanted to do this to a local thug's house but i scrapped it cause i couldn't find any spoons that big.

Next i wanted to make chlorine gas. WHY?? Well i just wanted to smell it ( darwin award incoming)

And i also really hated someone and i wanted them to breathe it in ( canceled due to quarantine)

So i made my chlorine by shocking salty ass water until it split itself to atoms,i smelled it,coughed a bit.

It feels like really really really itchy throat.

Last thing i wanted to make (most recent) was a pull tab grenade,originally a tripwire. I used firecrackers,wire,matches and more firecrackers to make a prototype,i tested it 2 times with success,but i couldn't work on it more cause stuff.

So now i'm in germany with no place to explode stuff and do dumb shit. Thank goodness.

But my addiction will remain until i fuckin die.

There’s nothing wrong with me at all is the thing. I’m a great looking guy and I’ve had more than my fair share of women already. I’m going to an Ivy League grad school next year, helped start a company, and have a great job lined after I graduate from school.

But what’s all that to a person if they have no one to celebrate it with and live this thing we call life together. Once I got to undergrad I started smoking weed almost daily and drinking once or twice a week, usually on the weekend with friends. And the girls in that circle that I get exposed to just aren’t girls that I want to be with long term. That’s not what I crave. And I know that me constantly smoking weed and feeling the need to drink every weekend is exactly what’s holding me back from meeting a woman that I actually want to be with. I’ve decided that I want to quit weed for good and at least take a break from drinking for a while. All support and advice is encouraged. It started last night, I was sitting in a executive suite at a college football game yesterday. You can say that everyone up there is fairly successful, and I looked around at all of the very successful older men and they all had one thing in common. They had one woman. Most of them married for decades. And it’s not that I need a woman to be happy, I’m extremely content with my life. So today I’m quitting smoking weed and I’m going to become the best possible version of me in hopes that I can obtain what my heart truly desires.",21,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.69485235}"

2020-09-12 16:21:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/irjzsr/how_i_almost_died_from_my_thc_oil_marijuana/,How I almost died from my thc oil marijuana addiction.,"Hey guys I just wanted to share my story with you . Hopefully it can benefit you or inform you in some way . So 3 years ago I started to use marijuana . More specifically , THC oils. Let me make something clear. These oils were not lab tested or anything like that since I am in an illegal state so yes, they were full of toxins. Beware of these. As much as u think u can buy from ur “boy” and get a good ass stizz pod for $50 what’s inside of it will kill you if not soon , then in the long run. Trust me on that. Don’t be a complete idiot like me and get hooked on it. Saying this, from my experience it’s better to stay away from any oil whatsoever even dispensary verified ones. At the end of the day u are inhaling burnt chemicals from a vape device . Not safe . Stick to the damn plant please🙏

I started using thc oil when I first turned 15.Tried it once and it was the first time I got high. I instantly fell in love with the feeling like many others. The literal next day I purchased an oil cart. I never could have imagined that this would have lead to years of agony and suffering . I started smoking the cart , puffing a few times a day. After a few days my tolernace started building and I Couldn’t get enough of it. A few puffs turned into 10 then 10 turned to 20 and 20 turned to 35 pulls a day. At the 3 month mark of smoking it didn’t even cross my mind that I was addicted , it’s weed after all right? Wrong. The first time I stopped my oil use Was 3 months in. It wasn’t voluntary either. I had run out of oil and I didn’t have any money to buy more. The first day sober I puked about 5 times and ran a fever. At this point I was dying for oil. I found some money went out  and bought another cart. I hit it and instantly every symptom went away. This gruesome cycle went on for a long time .After about a year of oil abuse I would average 20-40 hits a day of oil. I was as addicted as one could be. Keep in mind these oils I was using had chemicals and shit in them . It took over my brain and become much stronger than me. Weed controlled my entire life. I would never be happy unless I was high. I hated my life when I wouldn’t be high . I would rip my parents to pieces for no reason . I have severe anxiety issues so when I found weed there was no going back. It helped my anxiety too much. Anyways, this horrible pattern kept going for 2 and a half years until I went on vacation. On my vacation I brought my oil with me. ( I took it past tsa like an addict of course..) so while I was on vacation with my family it was around 2 am in the hotel room. I hit the oil in the bathroom when everyone was asleep. Next thing I knew I puked! Prior to this vacation I had been viciously burping everyday keep in mind. So when I puked my mind went to the place that the oil caused this obviously. As I’m thinking about what could make me puke, I ended up throwing up about 13 more times in a row. I was terrified I thoight I was dying . My parents were worried sick they had no idea what was happening. That night I had puked over 20 times. I needed to be taken to an ER and to hydrate me with fluids . They diagnosed me as having a stomach virus because I was too scared to tell anyone anything . I was in a deep dark hole. I started doing research once I recovered . After researching a bit I realized I had developed CHS. Once I realized I had this I got scared, I stopped smoking . This lasted me about 30 days. Once I felt better again I forgot the pain and agony I had gone through and decided to start smoking again. HORRIBLE CHOICE. I thought this time I could take one pull at night and manage it. But then again that’s what all addicts think. I resumed use for about 4-5 months before chs symptoms came back. Within the 4th month of smoking everyday again I started puking. I puked 25 times overnight, fainted and was rushed to the hospital. I had no fluids in me . I was put on iv and hydrated. I could have died the doctors told me. They also told me I was lucky I hadn’t damaged my stomach or internal organs . I was terrified for my life . I was in the hospital for 2 days. I’m coming to you know 1 week later. I’m detoxing from marijuana and recovering from chs at the same time. It’s a hell of a rough ride and no where near over. But I’m on a journey to recover. 

Guys, please don’t make the same mistake as me. If u have chs please don’t smoke again. And also, please do not smoke thc oils. If you do , make sure they are lab tested. But stay away if possible. Oils were slowly killing me for 3 years. Now I have chosen to go to rehab and better my life. I’m thankful that I was saved when I was, or I very well could not have been here. The chemicals in the oils also contributed to me slowly dying. Anyways, I just wanted to share my experience with oils. I did smoke plenty of actual weed as well but I am confident the oils did this to me! I hope you guys can learn from this. If you smoke fake oil stop. I know there are some of you out there right now reading this and you own a fake oil cart in ur house. Throw it out. Don’t make the mistake I made. 

If you made it this far , thanks for reading my story. It’s a struggle to give up my favorite thing in the world and I still am mentally and physically attached to it but it’s a process. I’m sober 6 days now and I intend to stay sober forever. If I resume marijuana consumption there is a big chance of organ failure and such so I don’t have a choice anyways. Thanks again for reading this. Learn from me and don’t make the same mistakes I made . Live your lives. Be happy. Make friends . 

I do have one question for my fellow recovering addicts . How will I ever be able to be in a social setting again with all my friends if they all smoke? Literally anyone I know smokes. Do I cut them off for good?? I’m at a loss with this and I’m sure rehab will help me through that but I would like advice. Love u guys💛",36,{'virus': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7826927}"

I’m 19F, and I think I want to quit smoking weed. I’ve been smoking every day since like November-ish, and smoking a lot more since corona. I probably smoke 4 times a day right now. I use weed to deal with my anxiety which is quite bad. I want to stop feeling confused and paranoid all the time, and I don’t feel like its fun for my BF 19M to have to hang around with someone who is confused and paranoid all the time. 

I take Sertraline and beta blockers for depression/anxiety and they work great but I’m thinking of asking for a higher dose of both. I feel like the next few weeks will be rough. I have a therapist from my university who I speak to weekly and I tell her a lot but I haven’t spoken about weed. Initially I didn’t want to tell her because she is affiliated with my university, but now I don’t want to tell her because I hate that I have kept it a secret for months. 

I’m not supposed to drink while taking my medication but I do, and last night I got blackout drunk and was really rude. I got defensive and offended by something really small and apparently wouldn’t talk to anyone/was rude to everyone. This hasn’t happened before, but I do often end up crying recently when I drink, I think because of my medication. So I think I need to stop drinking as well. My BF called me out for my shitty behaviour and I slipped back into a suicidal and pessimistic mindset which I used to experience a lot but rarely do now - and never to that extent. I was crying, hyperventilating, scratching at my own skin and having very disturbing thoughts for a few hours. My BF looked after me very well and has accepted my apology but I still feel shitty about it. Now I just want to smoke because I’m sad about last night. 

How do I stop myself from smoking/drinking? My life before I smoked weed sucked, I was sad and anxious all the time, so I feel like I’ll just return to that. But weed clearly isn’t good for me. I don’t know what to do.",8,{'rona': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.871702}"

Anyway, keep in mind long story short.","I’ve wanted make a post for a while but I hate to write up my whole life story. So I’ll try my best to keep a long story short: 

I come from a family of addicts. My parents abandoned me and my brother, left us with separate relatives. I was left unsupervised. I never had any reason to excel in life. Spent my high school years + mid 20s wasted on anything I could get. Shit started clicking in mid 20s, I cut back to just drinking, eventually stopped that. Now In my 30s, I’m sober, but it’s like in my mind im still a fuck up even though I’ve been on the “self development” kick for several years. I only relate to people who’ve been through similar shit, but those people are still fucking up. Every day conversations=me wanting to throw in drug references. 

My brother went the other way and is in and out of jail, homeless, and spun out. I’ve cut off all contact with him because I can’t be involved. He’s had opportunities to help his situation but hasn’t. For my own sanity, I can’t be involved. 

My mother is still alive, and similar to my brother, I can’t be involved. She definitely doesn’t have much time left. 

I have zero friends, antisocial as fuck. I can’t relate to people who’ve had “normal” lives. Overall I’m at a better place in life than I’ve ever been. I guess I’m just wondering if others have done the same and become completely antisocial and disconnected after getting their shit together/or had to disconnect from old friends and family. I feel like I have no one to relate to. I am married, but my wife has no idea what it’s like growing up the way I did (which is great, don’t get me wrong)

But for some strange reason, I just can’t muster the motivation to do the hard part: just stop taking the kratom. I’m not scared of withdrawals. I’m not scared of putting in the work for long term recovery. I’m scared of navigating my already terrible life without anything to soften the blow.

My life is empty. I don’t have friends anymore. I don’t have family anymore. I don’t have a job anymore. I can’t have children anymore. I don’t have savings anymore. I don’t have anything. In the past when I’ve been stuck in the throws of addiction, the idea of there being a better life on the other side of quitting is what gave me the power to take the plunge. I don’t have that anymore—I just can’t picture any semblance of a good life beyond this. My life was bad before, but Covid basically dialed that up to 1000.

It’s like being stranded in the middle of a vast, remote forest. In the beginning, you’re going to have some fight in you. You’re going to walk for miles and miles, desperately hoping to stumble upon civilization.

But eventually you’re going to accept that your effort is futile and it’s just not worth expending the energy. You’ll kick back against a tree, coming to terms with the fact that *maybe* a rescue team will come and save you...but you’re probably lost forever. At least you won’t spend what time you have left getting smacked in the face with branches or tripping over rocks and roots. Kratom is the tree I’m leaning against, just waiting for the inevitable to come.

So there’s my conundrum. I use drugs because I hate my life and I hate my life because I use drugs. I can’t afford therapy, I can’t afford rehab. I want to quit, I want a better life, but how on earth do I get myself out of this mess?

What Is (CHS) Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome?


Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition that leads to repeated and severe bouts of vomiting. It is rare and only occurs in daily long-term users of marijuana.
Marijuana has several active substances. These include THC and related chemicals. These substances bind to molecules found in the brain. That causes the drug “high” and other effects that users feel.
Your digestive tract also has a number of molecules that bind to THC and related substances. So marijuana also affects the digestive tract. For example, the drug can change the time it takes the stomach to empty. It also affects the esophageal sphincter. That’s the tight band of muscle that opens and closes to let food from the esophagus into the stomach. Long-term marijuana use can change the way the affected molecules respond and lead to the symptoms of CHS.
Marijuana is the most widely used illegal drug in the U.S. Young adults are the most frequent users. A small number of these people develop CHS. It often only happens in people who have regularly used marijuana for several years. Often CHS affects those who use the drug at least once a day.

What causes cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome?

Marijuana has very complex effects on the body. Experts are still trying to learn exactly how it causes CHS in some people.
In the brain, marijuana often has the opposite effect of CHS. It helps prevent nausea and vomiting. The drug is also good at stopping such symptoms in people having chemotherapy.
But in the digestive tract, marijuana seems to have the opposite effect. It actually makes you more likely to have nausea and vomiting. With the first use of marijuana, the signals from the brain may be more important. That may lead to anti-nausea effects at first. But with repeated use of marijuana, certain receptors in the brain may stop responding to the drug in the same way. That may cause the repeated bouts of vomiting found in people with CHS.
It still isn’t clear why some heavy marijuana users get the syndrome, but others don't.

What are the symptoms of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome?

People with CHS suffer from repeated bouts of vomiting. In between these episodes are times without any symptoms. Healthcare providers often divide these symptoms into 3 stages: the prodromal phase, the hyperemetic phase, and the recovery phase.
Prodromal phase. During this phase, the main symptoms are often early morning nausea and belly (abdominal) pain. Some people also develop a fear of vomiting. Most people keep normal eating patterns during this time. Some people use more marijuana because they think it will help stop the nausea. This phase may last for months or years.
Hyperemetic phase. Symptoms during this time may include:

Ongoing nausea

Repeated episodes of vomiting

Belly pain

Decreased food intake and weight loss

Symptoms of fluid loss (dehydration)

During this phase, vomiting is often intense and overwhelming. Many people take a lot of hot showers during the day. They find that doing so eases their nausea. (That may be because of how the hot temperature affects a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. This part of the brain effects both temperature regulation and vomiting.) People often first seek medical care during this phase.
The hyperemetic phase may continue until the person completely stops using marijuana. Then the recovery phrase starts.
Recovery phase. During this time, symptoms go away. Normal eating is possible again. This phase can last days or months. Symptoms often come back if the person tries marijuana again.

How is cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome diagnosed?

Many health problems can cause repeated vomiting. To make a diagnosis, your healthcare provider will ask you about your symptoms and your past health. He or she will also do a physical exam, including an exam of your belly.
Your healthcare provider may also need more tests to rule out other causes of the vomiting. That’s especially the case for ones that may signal a health emergency. Based on your other symptoms, these tests might include:

Blood tests for anemia and infection

Tests for electrolytes

Tests for pancreas and liver enzymes, to check these organs

Pregnancy test

Urine analysis, to test for infection or other urinary causes

Drug screen, to test for drug-related causes of vomiting

X-rays of the belly, to check for things such as a blockage

Upper endoscopy, to view the stomach and esophagus for possible causes of vomiting

Head CT scan, if a nervous system cause of vomiting seems likely

Abdominal CT scan, to check for health problems that might need surgery

CHS was only recently discovered. So some healthcare providers may not know about it. As a result, they may not spot it for many years. They often confuse CHS with cyclical vomiting disorder. That is a health problem that causes similar symptoms. A specialist trained in diseases of the digestive tract (gastroenterologist) might make the diagnosis.
You may have CHS if you have all of these:

Long-term weekly and daily marijuana use

Belly pain

Severe, repeated nausea and vomiting

You feel better after taking a hot shower

There is no single test that confirms this diagnosis. Only improvement after quitting marijuana confirms the diagnosis.

How is cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome treated?

If you have had severe vomiting, you might need to stay in the hospital for a short time. During the hyperemesis phase, you might need these treatments:

IV (intravenous) fluid replacement for dehydration

Medicines to help decrease vomiting

Pain medicine

Proton-pump inhibitors, to treat stomach inflammation

Frequent hot showers

In a small sample of people with CHS, rubbing capsaicin cream on the belly helped decrease pain and nausea. The chemicals in the cream have the same effect as a hot shower

Symptoms often ease after a day or 2 unless marijuana is used before this time.
To fully get better, you need to stop using marijuana all together. Some people may get help from drug rehab programs to help them quit. Cognitive behavioral therapy or family therapy can also help. If you stop using marijuana, your symptoms should not come back.

What are possible complications of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome?

Very severe, prolonged vomiting may lead to dehydration. It may also lead to electrolyte problems in your blood. If untreated, these can cause rare complications such as:

Muscle spasms or weakness

Seizures

Kidney failure

Heart rhythm abnormalities

Shock

In very rare cases, brain swelling (cerebral edema)

Your healthcare team will quickly work to fix any dehydration or electrolyte problems. Doing so can help prevent these problems.

What can I do to prevent cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome?

You can prevent CHS by not using marijuana in any form. You may not want to believe that marijuana may be the underlying cause of your symptoms. That may be because you have used it for many years without having any problems. The syndrome may take several years to develop. The drug may help prevent nausea in new users who don’t use it often. But people with CHS need to completely stop using it. If they don’t, their symptoms will likely come back.
Quitting marijuana may lead to other health benefits, such as:

Better lung function

Improved memory and thinking skills

Better sleep

Decreased risk for depression and anxiety

When should I call my healthcare provider?

Call your healthcare provider if you have had severe vomiting for a day or more.

Key points about cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome

CHS is a condition that leads to repeated and severe bouts of vomiting. It results from long-term use of marijuana.

Most people self-treat using hot showers to help reduce their symptoms.

Some people with CHS may not be diagnosed for several years. Admitting to your healthcare provider that you use marijuana daily can speed up the diagnosis.

You might need to stay in the hospital to treat dehydration from CHS.

Symptoms start to go away within a day or 2 after stopping marijuana use.

Symptoms almost always come back if you use marijuana again.

For example, every time I would want to take a hit of my vape I drink a sip of coffee, or eat a piece of candy.

It was a late Saturday night when she was born. Her mom anxiously waited as the nurse announced “its a baby girl”.  The nurse passed this precious little baby to her mother. The mom held her close to her body... held her hand and her heart was filled. 

She grew up quick, always holding moms hand, crossing the street, when she was scared, first day of school, when she was sad, whenever her moms hand was out she would reach for it and grab onto it.  Moms hand was Her safety. 

There came a time when this baby girl stopped reaching for her mommy’s hand... her mom would still hold it out but she had gotten older. She knew it was still there but didn’t need it anymore. She was a teenager. 

The baby girl had struggles through her life, her hand would reach out to her moms as times passed except now it wouldn’t be to hold it... it would be for bail, or bills,or money or to ask her mom to watch her grand daughter.   Times had changed. Moms heart wasn’t full as it use to be. It was broken.  But her hand remained extended. 

It was a late Saturday night when Mom got the call. She sat over her baby girls bed in the same hospital she was born in not so many years before. Baby girl had lost her struggle. Mom was holding her daughters hand. It was not how she remembered. The warmth was gone, her baby girl was gone. 

After she said her goodbyes to her daughter she walked out of the hospital room her heart was empty.   She suddenly felt the warmth  when she looked down. Through her tears she saw her granddaughter looking back up at her, holding her hand.

There doesn’t seem to be an end in sight. She has had a hard few years with domestic violence and drugs, so initially everyone was happy for her to go there. Now she seems to be stripped of her dignity and constantly drugged/sedated. She told me today the drugs they give her play with her memory and she just wants to take what her original doctor gave her before her hospitalisation. They said to me that she couldn’t have friends visit because she is too ‘elevated’. Her dad rang me while he was visiting and I got to speak to her. She apparently wanted a shower this morning at 6am and they refused which resulted in an argument about it so they gave her a pink liquid which she said was like taking methodone and made her totally out of it. It all just sounds so isolating and scary and nobody - including her family thought she would be kept there for weeks. She does have a strong personality and while there were very valid reasons for her to go in there, now she hasn’t touched any drugs in two weeks aside from what they give her. Is it possible they have started her on methodone? They seem to just drug her every time she cries, yells or gets upset. I don’t have drug or mental health problems and I’m pretty sure I would be a screaming, crying mess if I was locked in there for two weeks. I guess I’m looking for hope/reassurance? From what I know, it’s been a couple of years of solid addiction to meth and possibly heroin. Maybe she does need to be in there for longer than 2 weeks? She did seem out of it this morning, got a bit sidetracked here and there but she was able to hold conversation/answer questions and a bit of her old self was back.

Hey guys, for obvious reasons I won’t introduce myself with my name, but I’m a 20 year old guy who I consider a sex addict.

I’ve spent most of the money I made on escorts, I’m not proud of it, but lately I have fallen into a path of loneliness that I feel like I must have that thrill and that someone by my side who I can experience warmth and sexual pleasures.

I feel like it is my only reason to live actually, that thrill and excitement before I meet an escort really gets my mood up, and I will lie to my loved ones and manipulate in order to achieve it.

Most of my experiences with escorts are amazing, and I feel like there’s nothing stopping me from driving hours to meet the next girl when I have the money for it.

I am currently broke, looking for a job in these difficult times is challenging, but I know that once I have the money I will drive to a girl with my wiener in my hand and blow that money away.

At the end of the day it makes me feel good and less lonely, of course it’s sad that girls make money off of my loneliness but I will still feel amazing regardless. And I’m ashamed of it.

Here is my pain, 
my greatest heartache , 
my biggest failure as her sister. 
Writing about her death, her obituary & eulogy...was by far the most surreal experience I’ve yet to endure.  I just couldn’t let her go without painting her picture; describing who she was before drugs. I couldn’t begin trying to heal without speaking her name to everyone who loved her. Everyone who was grieving for her. I needed to share my pain, my parents pain, her children’s pain, my siblings and their pain....
I want everyone, addicted or enabling, to truly understand what it’s like to watch someone they love die because of a drug. 
The conversation is too quiet, still. 

My Beautiful Sister...
I wake up today knowing that I have to say goodby to you. And I can't. These last few days haven't been real. I haven't really witnessed things that are going to change me for years to come. 
While trying to remake her face as I remember, I run my finger across her cheek ever so lightly. 
She isn't real anymore. 
I trace her beautiful, perfect lips; remembering the smiles and the laughs. The moments that were ours. 
Those damn eyelashes of hers. I try and do the separating thing with the straight -pin trick she had mastered. I poke her eye. Her lifeless eye. I scream, forgetting just what this was. The task of preparing the cocooned caterpillar into the beautiful butterfly that is finally free. 
I finish with shaking hands. The mortician inspects and approves. Phase two begins. 
He asks my mother a question that no mother who has just lost a child should be asked. 

“Would you like to grab her legs and help me place her in the casket?"" 

She hesitates for the briefest of seconds before grabbing her daughters legs. Legs that are encased in a plastic body bag zipped up to her neck. 
Ever so gently, she places her down to sleep for the last time. I see the river of pain running from her eyes at the knowledge of what she had just done. From the cradle to the grave.
I watched my dad weep like a new widow. The pain in his tears was so heartbreaking because they told me what his words could not. Unable to be the hero he always had been. Just so unable this time. 
I look at these two little boys, knowing that their world -as her children- is essentially no more. Never again would they know her that way. 
Never again would they have the one thing that every child in this world wants most...
Their momma. 
A wiped tear from another would never do what their mothers touch did. 
See, she wasn't just this junkie...she was so, so much more. A daughter, a sister, a mother,  a friend.  She was SOMEONE to so many and Im going to put her back onto her pedestal where she belongs.

    To put you in a nutshell sis, you are what I always yearned to be. You were so beautiful and classy. Funny and ambitious. You could do anything, say anything. My admiration for you runs rather deep. I am so proud to be your sister! 
I loved your company and your humor. I loved your other side. The mischievous one. You were never afraid of anyone or anything. You always managed to make my day a little brighter, by being my personal silver lining.. 
Your love meant more to me than anything. Every moment of my life that included you, was so good. You radiated something that drew us near. All of us; like moths to the flame. 
I hope you know the impact you had. I hope you know you were an influence and my closest confidant. A sister that I held in the highest regard.
It brings me to my knees knowing I won't see you in the physical sense. Knowing that I have to learn to live a life without you in it. This void that’s left inside my heart is vast, a big piece died along with you.  
Please send me little signs of you. Let me think of you often, so I can laugh silently to myself. 
Play me a song in my head, so I’ll remember the moment it was meant for. 
Let me recognize you in your children  from your traits and features that you passed on to them.
Let me never forget your face and the beauty that was you.

I hope you truly are at rest now. Free to be the person you were always meant to be. 
I know that every day must close, every dream must end and every bright light must burn out. Thank you beautiful sister for starting that fire with me, and watching it burn with me. Our embers will never die out. I'm sharing with God one of my most treasured gifts, and it would be my honor. For her honor.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7251252}"

He said either get a job and get your shit together, or he’s moving out and he’s taking us with him. She started her new job(cooking at a preschool) and I’ve noticed that she comes home from work and seemingly consumes nothing and out of nowhere she becomes intoxicated. At first this happened like 4 times in a week and then it started happening everyday. Not only does she seem drunk but she seems completely wasted all the time and she blames it on being tired and exhausted from her new job. It’s been about three weeks and nobody really says anything about it because we’ve just grown used to it, although I do get major anxiety when I’m around her now. My little sister told me that while they were on a family trip(with all of my family friends as well) she was seemingly intoxicated from the moment she woke up to when she went to bed, (while only having a beer or two at night). This stressed me out a lot and when I heard that, I couldn’t even let her finish telling the embarrassing and humiliating things my mom did on this trip. So I finally starting looking for some kind of pills that she could be taking in her room. I found 3 different kind of Benzos prescribed to her. 2 were in the medicine cabinet and 1 was hidden in her room. Along with the 1 hidden in her room, I found an unlabeled orange pill container filled with hulks. Obviously not prescribed... and then I realized that she has been acting intoxicated in the same way my friend(who used to have a Xanax problem but got off) used to act when she was using. This morning, I took her bars and all her Benzos prescribed and not prescribed to test if she would freak out or not when she got home. She asked me if I took them I said no why, and she said she needs to prepare them for when she goes to bed...ya ok. Later she freaked out, after my dad confronted her, and claimed that the green bars were prescribed for sleep and she just peeled the label off. There was no sign of there even being a label on it in the first place. Anyway it’s 12 am and she’s still scrambling through cabinets trying to find some kind of pill, and I don’t know if I did the right thing or not. Idk what to do next because she obviously doesn’t want any help or did I do something too harsh?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8031519}"

Then he stopped drinking and I realized he was incredible. We’ve been together 2 years now and there has been slip ups, but it’s incredibly rare. I pretty much knew when it would happen because he would be blackout or a friend would see him out. However, recently, he’s just been sneaking to gas stations to chug beer, I assume, before coming home. I think this is a stress induced relapse. I think I’ve caught him every time he’s done this though, because I can smell it on him. But he’s not “drunk”. He has a meeting with a counselor in two days and I just smelt beer on him again. Whenever this happens, I just go completely silent because I’m just so disappointed and I don’t know what to say. I go to bed and he sleeps on the couch, even though he knows I don’t expect him to do that. I don’t want him to do that. I’m glad he’s finally going to a counselor, but it’s just another bill he’s going to stress about. I’m worried this will ruin our future together. It scares me because I thought he was done with it. We planned a life together. I just started grad school and all I can think about is this. He just had to buy a new car and we’re about to move. We both have to find new jobs during this chaos.

Throughout my teens it was nothing but drinking and using any substance placed in front of me. Eventually, I discovered heroin. That turned into the worst 5 years of my life. Luckily, I got my shit together and haven't touched heroin since 2015.

Now I'm not an AA/NA member. I tried that stuff and it never worked for me. I found my own way to get sober. Mostly, it involved building a normal routine, getting a good job, staying away from old people and places, etc.. and it works. I went from being a homeless fiend to having a pretty good life now.

Over the past 5 years since I quit heroin I've drank and smoked a little weed a few times. Nothing crazy. Over this past weekend my sister gave me a little bud and I thought ""Why not? It's been a while"". I smoked it. That was the first thing I'd done in over a year. 

It made me feel like shit. Physically and mentally. It made me wonder why I used to enjoy drugs so much. I feel as I've gotten older the desire to use and the enjoyment from it is gone. I won't even drink anymore since it just makes me sick. I have no interest in doing any of it anymore.

Anybody else ever experience this? Like I said, it seems like now that I'm older and fully matured I have lost any ""positive"" effects from drugs that I used to get. The enjoyment I used to get out of it is gone and after this past weekend any lingering desire to ever do anything again has left.

Edit: Wanted to add how I find it crazy that my life used to revolve around using. I cared about nothing except getting that next bag of dope in me. Now, when I look back, it disgusts me.

Soo going back almost 5 years ago, my dad had always struggled with drugs and he ended up ODing and passing away when I was 16. Next, my older sister has had major drug problems for many years too, this has led to my nephews being put into foster care. We are working on getting them placed with my mom, their grandma. Now moving to my mom, she has been my rock my whole life, my only stable family member and just all around a good, pure person.. I thought. 2 days ago, I found out my mom has been using meth. I don't know how long, but it's a 1000% sure thing. So this news fucked me up pretty bad. I feel like I've been tricked and lied to for my whole life because I've found out she has done it off and on for a while. And I know this next part sounds selfish but I can't help it, it's how I feel. I'm so fucking pissed at her for doing this to me. And to my nephews. Knowing all that I've been through with people I love doing drugs (what I've listed really is just the tip of the iceberg), my dad dying, my sister fucking up her whole life, my nephews being taken and SHE is the one who is supposed to be trying to get them back from foster care. Kinda hard to do when you're fucking geeking off meth. And I'm pissed she was so fake around me, like so much stuff she said and how she acted KNOWING she was doing freaking meth. And how bad she talked to my sister, knowing she was doing the same thing that ruined my sisters life. Anyways I love my mom so fucking much and I feel like I have to cut her off because thats what I do. You hurt me and it's over, blocked, done, don't talk to me. So I've been ignoring her calls and messages, she doesn't know that I know what she's doing. I can't pretend I don't know if I talk to her, and I know it's going to kill her when she finds out I know. She also tells my sister that me and my nephews are the only reason she hasn't killed herself but that's not fucking on me. I shouldn't be guilted into supporting yet another fucking meth head family member, especially my own mom. Anyways, sorry for the book, I'm sure I still forgot a few things lol. But I guess I'm looking for advice? How should I handle my mom? Am I wrong and a total bitch for ignoring her and considering cutting her off? I really am so lost because of all of this, I've been depressed since I can remember but this is definitely the worst it has ever been. I feel like I need to leave the country, and I don't know why, I know that's so weird but I really feel like if I don't get out of here I'm going to go insane or something is going to happen.

I've never actually posted here before but I've been wanting to.  Basically, I'm addicted to energy drinks, specifically the Full Throttle original citrus version.  I tend to drink two a day Monday through Friday, one on the way to work and one there.  On the weekend, it just depends.  I think the most I've had is three in one day.  I've drank them for years, although I sometimes go through spurts where I don't have any, although I think it's more due to laziness than because I don't actually want any.  Heck, I'm finishing drinking my second one of the day as I'm typing this.

I just turned 40 a few months back, and I want to make a change in my life.  I want to lose weight, and those two FTs are an extra 460 calories (230 each) in addition to whatever else I eat that day.  I try to stop myself from just going to whatever gas stations I know have them, but that never seems to work.  Even if I do manage to not get some on the way to work, I'll end up just going to a corner store a block away from my workplace to buy them.

I know energy drinks are not good for you, but I can't seem to stop drinking them.  Full Throttle especially tastes so good.

I Understand That Drugs Ruin Lives. Here's Why I Believe It Shouldn't Be Judged Negatively - And For A Good Reason.,"# This Post Will Be Hard For Many To Hear. Please Read It Still. Since Every Bit Of It Is True.

There are few things in life as horrible as the addiction crisis worldwide. I've spent some time in Victoria B.C., now there's a place where homelessness and drug addiction really shows. 

It's a beautiful island don't get me wrong, but the homelessness ratio is intense, but why?

These days we as a society tend to blame drug addiction on either-

* the people who do the drugs
* the people who sell the drugs
* the people who make the drugs
* the law enforcement
* the city governmental offices.

Although all of these sure do play a factor and a role - the problem will never be solved by attacking any of these aspects, or even if all aspects were challenged and faced - it still is not anywhere close to looking at the real cause of drug addiction. 

And I say this based on the science, not based off emotional bias.

The true cause....  

is you.

In this inspiring video titled ""[***The Root Cause of Addiction***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y51YETlzgU)"" -even without watching it you might find some proof in the comments. I'd guess it would be a task to try to count how many of them state *""I cried""* \- whether addicts themselves or the loved ones of addicts, and I too cried the first time I watched it. The second time as well. 

In fact it was a long while before I could watch it without crying and since the first time I've watched it I've probably showed this to over a thousand people personally, and I watch it again with them every time I show it to someone.

Because it's true.

The root cause of addiction, is disconnection. Most everyone I show the video to don't understand, so they don't cry. But those who do understand do cry. 

You see, in every aspect to where we as a society ""judge the addict"" - it is wrongfully judging, and it is hypocrisy. Because that very act of judgement - ***we feel.*** 

Of course we do. It hurts.

So, we use. 

And it's a sick cycle while there's a reason why it gets worse and worse in society, if you keep merely blaming the addict for choosing such a thing which, by the definition of addiction that kind of loses its meaning to be something to blame at all -why would it ever get better for society when you're feeding the root cause?

Even the aspect of being ""proud"" of quitting is falsely attributed in the manner it is, given that it's at the cost of the social stigma in valued amount of blame in judgment applied to the rest of the addicts. To rise at the sacrifice of others is not noble.

That's not honorable or a thing to be proud of. That's only making the dynamic more heavy as a theme for the addicts to be ostracized and treated as freaks, treated like we're not even human anymore. I think it's very ironic how people like to claim that addicts do it to ""numb out their feelings"" when it's quite obvious that if anything the addict displays very well how they feel all their feelings and-then-some. 

And actually what should be celebrated is the humbleness of the human being who has the authenticity and sincerity to **do as the man in that** [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y51YETlzgU) \-who put his jacket around the woman as it says: 

>***""We accept them. Whether they are using or not.****""*

Now I know every drug is different, and I haven't done every drug so I simply can't speak for all addicts in the sense of whether it numbs their feelings or not. So what is my drug of choice?

I know you were wondering, and probably for the most part it's egging at you in the back of your mind - a thing I've read on people through the years in personal experience. People have a need to be able to label and judge people under the context of understanding a niche or criteria of judgement, unless of course, they're addicts as well. So I should be fine here. Why should I tell when by default it's only so those hypocritical can disgustingly treat me like I'm not a human being, ironic to the very actions of treatment itself? To be human is to be humane, while to be an addict is to be dignified enough to have sought human connection -and when it wasn't found to be given- blamed none but instead found connection to themselves, and nothing is more self-connecting than the experiences an addict goes through. 

From the physical to the mental to the emotional to the spiritual - there is a reason the ancients related ""Neptune"" to both spiritual experience and alcohol abuse, and a reason to why the 70's was what it was.

Everytime you treat an addict like they are any lower or lesser than you - you not only tell them you want them to get more addicted - you not only provide the emotional pathway which is the root of all addiction - but you reiterate the status-quo of social norm to all who see or hear of the act.

It's hypocrisy to the highest level, and that's not opinion. 

That's science. That's backed in data. And it's just as true as the realization by every addict who watches that film and knows in their heart - there is no reason nor was ever a reason for them to be treated the way they were treated. It only always made - or makes - it worse. 

And the one thing that would have cured it all every single time - is authentic connection, friendship, bonding and being treated like a real human being, seen in their innocence -not horrendously held to ancient mistakes made as though you're the demon assigned to them to punish them in their personal hell, that doesn't ever make things better nor remind them of who they really are. 

While the truth is the only thing that ever makes a person believe they're anyone but themselves is the demand conditioned into them by the voices of those they trust and love saying things about *""who they are""* that are untrue, embalmed into their subconscious minds because how else would the words of your loved ones reach you but as if they were your own?

There's a lot of truth in this writing. I know. I don't expect you to remember much of what you just read unless you were, or are, an addict. That's the nature of denial.... It only subdues its veil by a person humbling themselves to admit sincerely that they were wrong, while aiming to empathize with those they blamed.

It's ironic how the psychosis of denial not-so-much pervades the addict,

so much as is the sickness of the sober citizen... although made suffered by both.

This only ends when the society as a standard realizes the dynamic, teaches the truth to its people, and stops regurgitating the false-values which cause it to begin with - and start teaching the values which are more authentic anyways, to the depth of how we truly feel for our loved ones.

I wish someone I loved would just come up to me and truly tell me how they felt if they truly wanted me to quit. Maybe I might not care - but it would be an equal miracle to see as for me to then not value what I only truly want.

You can give excuses away from it all you want but until you beat the science - any excuses are merely dogmatic belief against proven scientific fact. The way I see it, it's the least anyone could do. It's simple:

* either be demonic and causal, with disgusting character to then go and claim them as ""playing the victim"" when they quite literally are victim to your inhumane disposition, narcissistic really,
* or be like Christ taught. Sincere. It's not that hard, we see children be themselves all the time. Open and emotionally honest to the depths of their heart.

I think about killing myself every single day im alive, i escape to cope. I escape with isolation, i escape with drugs. The thoughts dull when im high, when i wake i want to die.  
Its always ever a temporary fix, pharmaceutical drugs or hard drugs its just a treatment. A balance. A way to numb your reality, because living like this is a waking nightmare. 

Again, on my meds, or off of them i dont want to exist. I hate myself, i hate everything about me. He was right, im worthless. Im pathetic, good for nothing and a piece of shit. 
When i try to better myself i take 10 steps back before i learn from the same mistakes I've made countless times. 

 Life is only temporary, and it's hurting me more to be here. The voice in my head is always against me, the voice never stops. But this is who i am, in the raw..Disorganized thoughts and overwhelming bouts of anxiety take hold of.me.daily. my thoughts race, sober or fucked up i can't escape it. 
Im either sleeping all day or not seeping at all. My life is a downward spiral, my mental health is at an all time low.
And the urges to end it are very real

Now I'm not judging and I'm not mad (just sad) that he was high, but when he asked to used my bathroom that changed. So he came over in a bad way. He had only a pair or shorts on that were 3 sized to large and his junk was practically hanging out so I gave him one of my belts he also had no shirt except a thick ass flannel shirt and it was 101°f outside and he was on a bicycle. So I gave him 2 of my mens t-shirts with the sleeves cut off and he asked if he could use my bathroom to go put the items of clothing on.



I said ok, thought nothing of it. Keep in mind that this man and I have had so many conversations about how he promised never to bring drugs around me or my kids, and that's exactly what he did. He went in the bathroom and fell in my tub, then I helped him up and went to get him a cold water. When u came back he was hiding behind the door and I thought he might have been looking through my jewelry box and I was like ""hell naw!"" So I opened the door and pushed him away from my jewelry and medicine cabinet only to see him holding a baggy of meth with a straw in it up to his nose and he right off the bat asked me if I wanted some.


I started shaking. I was so crushed and so triggered but I guess I shouldn't have been so surprised by it. But I immediately took him to the front porch and told him to leave. I told him that if he couldn't respect my sobriety and not bring that shit around then he'd have to leave and never come back. I said that if he would have had even just a moment longer with that shiy in my home and I'd have done some then he'd have been partially responsible for destroying my life and the lives of my 2 little boys who would have never known why mom left and never came back.


If I'd have relapsed, I would have died. Thankfully I was strong enough to ignore the instant craving and push him away and out my door. I should never have let him in my house but I do care about him and I was just trying to help because I would have loved some help when I was in that position. But I learned my lesson for sure.

I’m 18 and did a lot of lsd and smoked weed daily along with other drugs occasionally for about 6 months when I was 16-17. I stopped my lsd use when I had a terrifying trip that traumatized me.

I felt hopeless. I thought I fried my brain. I had such a bright future and I ruined it, I thought. Slowly I pulled myself out of the hole one step at a time. I went to therapy and started TM. Step by step day by day I slowly climbed out of the hole. I worried that I arrested my development but as I get closer and closer to full recovery I can see that this challenge will land me eons ahead of my peers in my ability to be adaptable and open minded. I didn’t arrest my development I just changed the path which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I also notice the little things in life a lot more like nature. And I appreciate the relationships I have with people more.

People ask me if I think I damaged my brain and I say I don’t think so but who cares. The past has already happened all that exists is the present and the future to come.

To anyone struggling with a bad trip, you will get though it! Eat healthy, sleep, meditate, exercise, go to a therapist if needed, and practice gratitude.

Heroin OD,"I never thought it'd be me posting a friend's death. 26 now, most of us have stopped the crazy stuff. One of the best friends, closest friends I ever had died yesterday morning. Heroin. We live in Alabama. Far away from many of the hotspots. He was 30 years old. I've tried to sit and console and contact other mutual friends of ours. It catches every time in my throat. It's been 2 of the longest days of my life. I've had my mentor and grandmother die of essentially natural causes at \~75. But not like this. Nobody like this. I love him so so much. He was so fucking smart. I hardly ever, ever say anyone is smarter than me. I'm a smart guy. Not like him though. He was always better at the classes than I was, not better grades, but like, better. And I was one of the best. He put all my stuff to shame. He had a one track mind, but whatever he was doing for that phase, he went all in. Every story he told, it wasn't just some story. A trip to the grocery store was suddenly the ultimate battle of the forces of good and the armies of evil. Like just delusions of grandeur about the most mundane shit. Always so smug, because he was always right. But he actually was. His addiction burned a lot of bridges with people he loved. I told them he loved them the best he could. I'm an only child, but he was the closest I ever had to a big brother. I hope his family doesn't try to hide him and his service, I would like to show them that important people like professors come, that friends drive across the country to come, that their son was loved, and not some fuck up. He fucked up, but that's not what he was.

He had so many chances. He wrapped his car around a tree at 100 mph, walked away with a couple bruises. ODd years ago and woke up in a hospital. Got arrested at gunpoint. Totaled another car. And so many more that I can't think of or that no one ever knew about but him. He had nine lives. 

He and I used morphine and all kind of shit together. Anything we could get our hands on. I walked away from it \~6 years ago. Why couldn't he? I understand what's it's like to need something, anything, to dull the pain, to dull the awareness. I know what the withdrawals are like from first hand experience. I understand addiction so well from my own struggles, but never had to confront it in someone else. Not like this. Plenty of times I thought he crashed his car into a ditch or something, plenty of times I was so sure he was gone. But when they told me yesterday, I couldn't believe it.

I wonder if he knew how many people loved him and how many people his decision would hurt. Even more, how many people he would have come to know and impact. Whatever field he finally settled on, he would have excelled.

Just please, remember those around you. Even if you think nobody would miss you. Call a hotline, go to church, or volunteer somewhere. There are so many people that would come to love you, just the way they did him.

A little side note: I was an IV heroin user for about a year when i was a late teen, got hooked on Oxycontin and graduated to H. This was almost 15 years ago. Been clean from opiates since. I still use Marijuana and have done many drugs since but mostly trip maybe once or twice a year now and drink socially but very rarely. I know my limits and try to keep a clean head for the most part. I went through a Narconon program so i don't follow the 12 steps, I believe they are not entirely helpful for living a good life and moving away from the social ties of the addiction realm. I don't bash them as i know they work well for many people, it just wasn't for me. (Im not a scientologist either, although they tried recruiting me after the program). 

Anyways;

The drinking. I'm not entirely sure when it started but i believe she has been drinking pretty consistently since college, almost ten years ago. She got divorced about 4 or 5 years ago around the time we met but before we started dating. She also got a DUI around this time as she was dealing with losing her husband, home and dogs, it seemed like she was trying to drown the sorrow with alcohol. I helped her when she lost her license for a month and took her to her DUI classes and drove her to work. She then had Interlock (breathalyzer) in her car for a year, so she was able to drive again but i believe she was still drinking beer at night. This was before we really started dating. She would occasionally come over and we'd be intimate but i believe she was usually intoxicated although she seems to handle her alcohol pretty well so it was hard to tell. Fast forward a year or so and we have moved in together. I started noticing that she would come home from work and would have bloodshot eyes, wobbly balance, etc. I then started noticing she would go into the bathroom when she got home everyday and would take her backpack with her. She'd typically spend 20-30 minutes in there, i assume just taking a few shots to unwind. 

When she drinks she doesn't seem to think i notice even though I've been to several rehabs, have been around plenty of alcoholics and it is pretty night and day in the way she behaves. She is less talkative or starts talking about abstract things that don't make a lot of sense. She doesn't get the social cues that she is making me uncomfortable as i don't want to spend my time with someone who can't enjoy themselves unless they're drunk. She is starting to struggle with money and is letting regular responsibilities go by the wayside instead of dealing with them and asking for help. We both make decent money and live pretty comfortably but I've been starting to sacrifice my savings and my time to cater to her lack of responsibility. She does work her butt off and is never late but i worry that she may be drinking in the morning and throughout the day. 

At this point, I'm really not sure how to go about dealing with the situation. I know i should being it up and tell her how it makes me feel but i worry she'll go to greater lengths to try and hide it. I don't want to push her to drinking and driving more or to make her feel ashamed. She is aware of my past as well but I'm less familiar with how to deal with alcohol abuse as it's never been a personal vice of mine. Her family lives halfway across the country but i almost feel as if she should go home and get some professional help. Not to sound selfish but I'm in my early 30's and I'm trying to make greater strides in my life to be an adult and live a happy life, I really don't want to spend the next few years, possibly many more trying to help someone kick an addiction. I just don't know anymore. I have been actively working more and spending time doing my own thing so i don't have to be around her because she seems to be pretty consistently drunk. It's making me angry and sad and i feel like an asshole for it. 

I really could use some guidance on how to go about this. I've read i should let her hit rock bottom before she will be willing to get help but I feel that would be shitty of me to do instead of intervening and helping before it gets to that point. Thanks in advance for reading this. I haven't really had many people to talk to about this and i can't keep burying it anymore for my own sanity. I could probably have gone on more but i think this gives the general feeling and i have a lot on my mind to try and put in a post.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5666266}"

This might not be the right sub, if you know where I should post it I’d be glad to hear! :)

So, my mom smoked regularly until like 2016/-17(I don’t know for how long she had smoked before that, and I can’t remember how many a day either), she had a year or two free. 

Ever since I was born she had been eating a little too much without exercise(she did a little yoga, but rarely and she later quit). She eats a week worth supply of chips or chocolate in a day or two.

I eat a little more sweets your’e supposed to, but I exercise a lot. (Handball, 4-5 days a week)

Then, in the beginning of 2018 or so she started smoking again (about 10 a day) She has sleeping issues and a terrible temper(must be because of that). She didn’t smoke inside, but when we were outside and around her she sat right next to us, like why..? We don’t smoke..? I don’t want bad lungs because of that! I rarely told her to move, if I did she usually listened but got irritated. I held my breath around her. She got a little pissed at that too.

Now, when I have approached her and asked her why she started smoking again, she said “she just wanted to”. I asked why, why did she just want a nicotine addiction? She didn’t answer and went out to smoke again. She littered the stumps too. I told her those are very environmentally toxic, she said yup, rubbed it on the asphalt and let it stay there. I hated this!

She recently got a vape she just has in her purse, which I guess is better than tossing stumps all over, but I don’t know a whole lot about this. 

I love her, she is my mom but it is kind of tough to have this issue between her and me. My dad and I have talked between us that we don’t want her to continue this behaviour. It is just that she doesn’t listen to us. Do you guys have some advice?",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6854138}"

After two serious fentanyl overdoses in June of 2019 right after my high school graduation, I was having a hard time. My depression was just worse and I had no hope. Two days before I hit the six month mark in December, I bough a gram of cocaine and then 20 Xanax bars. Then I finished it and relapsed again in early March. That was my last binge. I bought 9 Xanax bars and on the 5th, I took five and showed up to one of my classes totally gone. The professor showed mercy and took me to the counselors on campus, who then called 911. I’m still grateful she did that. 

After that day, the humiliation, the concern from my friends, the absolute horror that I was feeling in what I have done, I decided that I needed to be finished. The road since then has been very difficult. Having to face my depression and deal with it, Fighting cravings, my mom even suspecting I was using at times I wasn’t. It’s been rough. A lot of tears along the way. But today, September 6th I finally hit a point I never thought was coming. Will it last? Who knows. Only time will tell I guess, because I miss it every day. At times I want nothing more than to crush up a couple pain pills and rail them. But I’ve gotten this far, I guess it’s motivation to keep the number growing.

I think the fact that I’m living on my campus with my one loyal friend since freshman year of high school has been a huge help. Having people nearby I can see is making the difference I didn’t think to utilize. I still don’t open up about it to people because it’s really hard and I don’t want to be judged. But I’m proud of myself.

My ex and I broke up 10 months ago but recently came into contact. She left me for a guy with a coke addiction and started enjoying coke herself.

The problem is that she lied to me about how much she enjoyed coke at first. She said it was “whatever” nothing special upon further conversation she admitted it was fun and it was becoming a weekly habit. And im concerned shes lying about having stopped months ago.

I’m super angry as she dumped me for this mess. But i still care for her deeply and im upset at her lying to me about drugs. She said she won’t do it again and doesnt want too. 

It’s sunday and we follow each other on a social media platform. I just woke up and noticed she was up on a holiday weekend at 6am althought it’s not a clear indicator it makes me suspect she was doing drugs all night (cocaine keeps you awake hours after your last line). 


I’m sitting here on my feelings because i can’t talk to her for a while really mad and anxiously awaiting the day we can speak. 

At this point shes my ex but I even want to reach out to her mom. My ex has underlying heart issues and the coke is even more dangerous for her.

He lost the battle to addiction after seven years of being a drug addict.

Adam had the best laugh. It was loud & boisterous. He was tall, handsome, daring and charming. Eight years my junior, I grew up watching him come into his own. I remember him putting on magic shows in the living room. One time, he wanted to hold my hand on the roller coaster when he was scared. Adam wanted reassurance that he wasn’t too old for that. As any big sister would, I told him of course it was okay.

As time went on, I grew to be the worrier of the family. Adam grew up to be a total daredevil. Jumping off the Stratosphere in Vegas, flying a hot air balloon with my Dad, and living his life in the fast lane.

My brother was the kind of guy that grabbed life by the horns and stared fear in the face with a smirk. I used to think of him as a cat with many lives because no matter what happened, he always came out of the situation unscathed.

He became a drug addict slowly, but with warning signs. In the end, it seemed like he was overdosing every other day. The calls from rehabs and hospitals were relentless. The year before he died, my parents got a call from California encouraging us all to fly out there. He overdosed and his numbers were horrible. In this dark time, we all prepared to say goodbye to him. Miraculously, he landed on his feet yet again.

This time the overdose had consequences. He passed out on his hands and this caused serious nerve damage. He couldn’t use his hands for a while, but with his first hand surgery he acclimated quite well. The doctors said his hands wouldn’t recover and that the damage was permanent.  After about six months, he started to get movement back in his hand and to our surprise, were told he’d make a full recovery. I remember him sending me a video of him moving his hands. I sat there in awe, crying happy tears.

Surely, this will all make him wake up and stop using, I thought. I hoped. In times like this, hope is the only thing that really gets you through. Every time something catastrophic happened, this was my mindset.

We never quite got the whole story, but I knew things weren’t looking good. He seemed to be spinning faster towards danger and I felt angry that there wasn’t a damn thing I could do to stop it.

In the year or so before he passed away, my friend Kate who had lost her Dad to alcoholism, told me to prepare myself for the worst. She said she had wished she accepted the fact that he could die before it happened. Maybe, just maybe, if I could do that, it would help me in the long run. I reluctantly took her advice. I sat down in my office and really thought about what she said. I cried for what felt like forever.

This harsh but valuable insight from my dear friend helped me beyond words. Every time I saw my brother, I acted as if it could be the last time. This has brought me a great amount of peace looking back on things. I don’t have regrets of what I could have done, because I know for sure I tried everything. Tough love, soft love and everything in between.
Of course, none of it worked so there is a part of me that feels defeated. Who am I to impart any wisdom on others?

There is great peace in being able to look back on things with a clear conscience. I never looked at addiction through rose colored glasses. I saw it exactly for what it was no matter how difficult it was. I remember begging on the phone to his rehab not to let him out because I was worried he’d overdose and die. I was told there was nothing they can do to keep him there. It was his choice to leave. I’d be on the phone from morning to night fighting for answers.

I spent hours talking to him about his addiction, trying to understand it and help him in any way I could. I suggested everything I could possibly think of and was there for him anytime he called me. I’d take his calls even when I suspected he was high. Sometimes he’d make no sense and ask for money. Other times, the Adam I knew and loved was just calling to say hi. I never missed one of those calls.

Most importantly, I spent as much time as possible with him and always hugged him extra tight before I left. I told him how much I loved him and cherished every second. If I had not done this, I know for sure I’d look back with regret.

Something I wasn’t prepared for was how permanent death is.

He flew home from rehab in California and I saw him the day before he died. He was back in town to get surgery on his other hand. I remember him standing in the driveway on my way out. I told him again for the millionth time not to use, especially before or after his surgery. He agreed not to and I told him I loved him. We hugged and I got into my car. That was the last time I saw my brother.

I wanted to write this open letter to anyone that will read it. To those who are suffering with addiction and the families around them, please know that you are not alone. I grew up in the middle class. We had a nice house on a cul-de-sac. We were taught to love each other. No one would have expected what was going on in our lives.

I want to share a few words of wisdom I have learned along the way. Take it as you will.
To those of you in the beginning stages of grief… hold on. I know you feel like you’re drowning and can’t catch your breath. You will breathe again, I promise. In the beginning, my family took everything ten seconds at a time. I cried for months in grocery store lines. There were long periods of time where I woke up crying and I went to bed crying. I could hardly catch my breath.

Please, hang on. We had an outreach of support from friends and family in the darkest time of our lives. I encourage you to reach out to those that love you and let them take care of you when you need it.

Cry your eyes out. I used to hate crying until I realized how healing it is. Let’s be honest, I still hate it, but I can recognize its undeniable benefits. To process grief, you have to feel the emotions behind it. I promise, you won’t cry forever. Crying is good for you and is so incredibly tiring. Cry yourself to sleep, bring tissues everywhere you go and allow yourself to feel whatever it is you’re feeling in the moment.

To anyone suffering with addiction, please know you are loved and you are not alone. I want you to know that losing a family member to this is the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. It’s been a year and a half, and I still cry every single day. Please, do everything you can to take the addiction seriously and to get support in any way you can.

Addiction is something a person is suffering with. It does not define who they are. It’s easy to judge an addict until you have walked the same path. Offer kindness and love to the addict instead of judgment. That addict is someone’s family member or best friend. All I’m saying is, love goes a lot farther than judgment. As humans, we are all suffering in some way. It makes the world a much better place to offer encouragement, love, and understanding to a person.

To families and friends of addicts, I see you. I know how painful and hard it is to watch someone you love go further down the rabbit hole. It’s a hopeless, devastating feeling I wouldn’t wish on anyone. I try to openly share my story with others. You would not believe the amount of people who are dealing with the exact same thing. We feel like we need to hide in the shadows because it’s embarrassing to discuss. Trust me, I get it. Please remember, none of us choose this. It’s something that unfortunately happens way more than it should.

To those reading this, thank you for taking the time to listen to what I have to say. I miss my brother every single second of every single day. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still hear his laugh. On the really tough days, that gets me through.

And to my brother Adam; fly high. I will never forget you.

There's a reason why people go in and out of them like 5x. I struggled with addiction for 10+ years, and after doing literally everything that traditional medicine had to offer, I went a different route.

Functional / integrative medicine cured me (and no it's not voodoo medicine). Rather than saying that my addiction was a moral failing, they treated the biological root causes of my illness. That's right, you're not mental. It's not in your head. Addiction is a biological-based disease that hijacks the brain-reward cascade and shuts down the prefrontal cortex.

The more that you ""use"" the more dendritic arms your neurons grow FOR that addictive-based dopamine spike. You literally grow a network of addicted brain cells that embeds itself into the structure of your biology. It get's bigger because you build tolerance and need more dopamine to fill the expanding network.

Anyways... I help develop clinical programs that treat the causes of addiction. I also work with a new  integrative medicine-based addiction recovery center called [Ampelis](https://ampelisrecovery.com/). It's the first non-conventional rehab center that exists and is doing treatment right. It just opened in Utah and they are going to expand across the US. Because they are new, they are offering some discounts, but they don't accept insurance (remember that this rehab is meant to work for you 1x not 5x).

They help with mental issues (anxiety, depression, PTSD) substance abuse, and process addictions (gambling, pornography, video games, eating disorders). It's worth checking out if you really are desperate and have tried everything. [Ampelis.org](https://ampelis.org/) or [https://ampelisrecovery.com/](https://ampelisrecovery.com/)

I'm also about to start a new research project with one of their owners / PhDs on ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for addiction. There's just so much that we don't know, and actually therapies that exist besides talk therapy.

This was an NA meeting. They told me I was an addict and I need to find a Higher Power too get me out of this nightmare. 90/90 they said was the best way too start, get a sponsor, work the steps and do service. That sounded great too me as an atheist, only got to find a Higher Power and get social. I can do this, I want to get out of this nightmare so I will do anything, Im at the end of the road, surely these people would tell me the truth? So you start going too meetings, you share, altho you dont want too at all. I felt like utter shite. I dont like being in groups, I never liked it. This was all normal they said, this is part of your recovery, wait for the miracle. So I stayed, worked my ass off, shared my hardest moments. Didnt work. It only made my cravings worse.

12 step groups believe in Bill W. Bill W believes in his 12 steps. Bill W was highly narcisistic. He was a black & white thinker too the core. Addiction is all about black and white thinking, splitting, thinking in extremes, 0 and 1, yin & yang. So it came as a surprise too me the founder of AA was splitting the 12 steps. If it doesnt work for you, you are death was the message in the Big Book.

Bill W had a spiritiual awakening. Bill was soo out of his mind and hallucinating because of his alcohol withdrawal, he saw stuff appear that wasnt there. Just like a religion come up with this kind of unproven crap. 

I will get too the point. It worries me rehabs are picking 12 step meetings as a fundamental base for recovery, because it isnt. I would say it makes recovery harder for the majority of addicts. We addicts are free thinkers most of the time, not religious people. 12 steps telling addicts you dont have a choice plays only the hand of the addiction, not the addict.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.788438}"

I like cocaine a lot. There was a time period of roughly two months during the initial wave of COVID in my state when I did cocaine every day, pretty much all day. Not enormous amounts but it was constantly in my system. At that point I was an addict. I am now several months clean. I even bought some for a bachelor party last weekend and paced it out, eventually tossing the remainder because I didn’t want it around. 

I want to know if I lost any neural capacity from using so much. I have never been a prestigious scholar, but I am in graduate school and it requires a lot of mental effort. I am afraid that I shot out some neural connections. I am afraid that I am not the person I was one was. I do suffer from chronic anxiety and depression, so I’m hoping it’s just all in my head.

In the UK, more than 9 million people say that they often or always feel lonely. In the United States, 5 out of 3 are suffering from loneliness. Our social lives depend entirely on social media platforms Like Facebook, Whatsapp, Snapchat. The result of this increasing dependency increases our social loneliness. but what are the actual signs of loneliness?**

On this blog, I am going to discuss the signs of loneliness. So, you can understand if you are suffering from loneliness or not.

**Before I tell you the signs, I want to say; there is a massive difference between being alone and being lonely. They are not the same thing.** 

**Introverts like me value alone time, love to spend time with myself, generate more ideas to help the world.** 

**Loneliness, on the other hand, leads to feelings of isolation. Having no one there talk to, turn to, or be with when you want to. Understand your signs of loneliness before its too late**

**So Are you lonely ? or you want to spend more time with yourself?**

**I am curious. Let me know in the comment section.**

## YOU ARE TIRED

**This is the very signs of loneliness Researchers found that sleep and loneliness are very close. The study found that feelings of loneliness and isolation led to higher instances of disrupted sleep and exhaustion during the day. Loneliness contributes to other issues like depression, which impact rest.**

**Dr. Leana Karena says that “Lonely people do not experience fewer hours of sleep, but instead wake up more frequently throughout the night.**

## YOU FEEL DOWN

**While those with depression often isolate themselves, low mood and sadness are also closely connected to loneliness. Social support makes us feel like we are valued, and others care about us. But if you cut yourself off from the people, you can lose sight of this, damaging your self-esteem- as you doubt people’s opinion of you. If you’re isolated from others, you can drop into a cycle of negative thoughts- feeling less and less engaged with the world.**

## YOU FEEL ANXIOUS IN THE SOCIAL SITUATION:

**Loneliness enforces cyclical feelings of isolation, making it so damaging to your mental health. When we feel alone and cut off, we’re less likely to feel the drive to go out and actively socialize.** 

**As a direct result of this, social anxiety begins to build up when we think about social events in the future.** 

**Socializing is a skill like swimming. If you swim every day, your skills stay sharp, and you feel confident in your ability. But if you fall out of practice and suddenly need to rely on these skills again, you may find yourself consumed by panic and doubt in your abilities.**

## YOU ARE ALWAYS IN SOCIAL MEDIA

**These days, it’s hard to find someone who is not social media- as it’s so ingrained in our lives. But if your phone is glued to your hand all the time, this could be a warning sign. Social media addiction and loneliness are both sides of the coin. Social media is a virtual source of recognition and validation, causing lonely people to gravitate toward it.** 

**According to researchers, people who spend two hours or more a day on social media are twice as likely to feel lonely than those who pay thirty mins or less.**

## YOU LOCKED YOURSELF IN YOUR ROOM OR BED

**Loneliness encourages us to stay locked in our homes, precisely one spot like the couch or bed. You may find you have no problem wearing your pajamas all day and binge-watching tv or spend vast amounts of time on social media. Doing this every once in a while is understandable, but if you do this daily, then something may be wrong, especially if you feel emptier than fulfilled.**

When I would go to sleep at night, I would dream in the video game I was playing, cuz that’s the only thing my brain had been processing, this was because it served as a permanent escape from reality, I wouldn’t have to think about shit while playing. I am an athlete, and it took my 3 years of hard work to become physically fit and brought me back to square one. It was horrible. But I got over it, and it was amazing, once I fully recovered. But then my childhood best friend overdosed on cocaine and losing him sent to a place much worse than I’ve ever been. 

There was a moment, when I was sitting at a table at his funeral, where a women was walking around offering people alcohol, and I was planning to ask for some. Now, keep in mind that my entire family is full of alcoholics. It killed my grandpa and made extremely abusive, giving my dad PTSD and other emotional problems, and it caused my great uncle, who graduated harvard, to wind up in a trailer park in his mid-30s, where he still resides to this day. So, alcohol has always been a no-go for me. I have never even thought about touching it, and I’m in high school. But in that moment, I didn’t care. I wanted to get rid of the awful feelings so bad I was willing to roll the dice to see if had the alcoholic gene or not. 

Don’t worry, I’ve snapped out of it now, and am so thankful that the women told me no when I asked her for some, but just the fact that I was so willing to do so in that moment scares the shit outta me. That meant that I had literally given up. I know what alcohol does for my family. It ends us. Literally. But in that moment I didn’t care. 

Now that I’ve said all that, anyone have any insight? I’m sure anyone suffering from an addiction can relate to the giving up feelings, as have I in the past. Idk if you can relate to the fact that I wasn’t yet addicted, but just an FYI, I have a bunch of impulse control issues because of my ADHD and so I’ve made horrible decisions like that many times before, thought maybe not quite so bad.",2,{'quarantine': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.65053}"

Anyone know something about this? I'm gonna taper off benzos with Norflurazepam (60-88h HL) How much and when do I take? I also need to taper phenibut.," Hi sorry if this is the wrong subreddit. The benzo is not well known or used but it's the only thing I can get my hands on with a long half life.

Ive taken dicazepam for almost 5 years. In December last year I started a diclazepam taper for my Flualalprazolam use. I started at 10mg diclazepam and got down to 1mg 4 months later (while using phenibut and kratom). Now I use 0-4mg diclaz a day (got a little strange lately with the kratom W/D)

Then I had some personal issues which delayed my taper by 3 months. Then I started tapering kratom, which I got off 2 days ago, still havent slept since then but I feel fine expect for diahria. I'm hoping to go to the hostipal here within a month, they offer 4 week benzo detox but I need to stop phenibut first so I can be admitted. I use about 4g phenibut and I've been using it for 5 years, and currently sporataticly 1-2 times a day , 2-4 gram. I believe I can cold turkey phenibut if I have to, I did 3 -4 days without 2 weeks ago and I was ok, I did feel really wrong the last day, anxiety like symtpoms, which diclazepam W/D never gave me, I just act like a methhead on a comedown I feel only very very irritable, speedy, and aggressive, just an asshole, and general anxiety (opening mail, doing stuff im supposed to, boredom, RLS, and other physical sympthoms like sweating and high HP (sometimes in these moods I just refuse to take benzos and just go a little crazy... not good.. and I know I probably can't do it and don't want to do it at home for the last part

The diclaz is gone but Norflurazepam should get here within a couple days or after the weekend but I don't think I should take it every day... I did the same with diclaz (42h HL) and I have never noticed any change after a dosage... I have absolutely no clue if I had taken 2mg in the morning for example. Only after a week I notice real WD.

Norfl also has a Light2-5mg Common5-10mg Strong10-20mg+ dosage. I have no idea what to take? Just the common dosage every day, or like 15mg every 3 days?

I just hope I can get clean before December so it won't take longer than a year, but better a.s.a.p. don't get sucked into benzos kids... even with no anxiety, it can still get you and it take sooo long to get off, ruined a big part of my life, and recovery costs a lot of money! financially fucked me proper. I'm 26 I changed so much in 5 years I don't even know what it feels like to be myself, or sober, or what it feels like to have no benzos or weed in my system, no idea who i really am, I cant even imagine feeling real life, drinking a coffee and feeling good instead of either nothing or sweaty clammy hands...",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5809671}"

So long as it is with me, no matter where I am, I feel like I am at home. The problem here is that it has stripped my life away from me completely. My life is on this thing. It has gotten in the way of my friendships/relationships, it has prevented me from finding new ones, it consumes pretty much every waking hour of every day of my life. I am the perfect example of how people in my generation are glued to their phone/computer. Don't get me wrong, I do have a zest for life outside of my laptop; I fantasize about and aspire to step out of my comfort zone and live my life to the fullest, I just never really do it. I do have a bit of social anxiety, but not to an extreme extent or anything. I have no problem talking to people if I have to, but I normally wouldn't go out of my way to do it.

So in terms of seeking any sort of advice, I don't really know what I'm looking for honestly. So if you want to share your thoughts, just take everything I said and tell me the first thing that comes to your mind after reading it, really. Any questions or comments are welcome. The point/TL;DR though is, I don't know if this is an addiction or what, but I feel like I spend an unhealthy amount of time on my laptop while cooped up in my bedroom.

That same rule can be applied to quitting an addiction also. 

Every time you try to quit an addiction, and fail, everyday take 1 thing out of your life and never go back to it, something you love or do on a regular basis and don’t ever turn around and go back to it no matter how much you love it until this addiction is defeated. Ultimately this messes with your control system in the brain and overrides it, and make it clear that until you break the addiction you can no longer get the things you want anymore little by little.

I’m 22 years old. Throughout 2015-2017 I was a drugged out mess. Doing tons of cocaine, alcohol, adderall, and my favorite drug Xanax. I was taking an insane amount of Xanax around that time that ruined many relationships and I even got a DUI right after I turned 18 while driving on Xanax and crashing into a street pole. Late 2017- early 2018, I got my shit together 100%. Had a very solid job, got super into working out and eating healthy and looked great, I even started college and am now and am
doing great in school (I even made the deans list) on my way to getting my bachelors and hopefully my masters. Which is such a turn around for me because I did awful in school my whole life, I even got kicked out halfway through my senior year and ended up graduating from a continuation school. But in early 2019, I was sick one week, I woke up one morning that week and was having the most insane chest pains ever. They would not go away, so I went to the ER. They took my blood and my Troponin levels were at 2.7, they were thinking I had a heart attack but at the same time they were saying that’s basically impossible due to my age. They ended up doing a cardiac catheterization surgery that day to check my arteries out, which looked fine. Upon more tests, they found out my heart was only working at 30% horsepower, I was emitted to the fourth floor of the hospital (the cardiac unit) and all the nurses were saying I was the youngest person who was ever up there. I ended up being diagnosed that day with cardiomyopathy and heart failure. They told me I was never gonna be able to work out again (which was a major part of my life and sobriety) and also insinuated that they’re not sure how much longer I have to live, so you can imagine how this made me feel. That whole next month I started having chest pains and went back to the ER multiple times, turns out they were just panic attacks (chest pain caused the panic attacks because it was just like how it felt before). So, to combat the panic attacks, after about a year and a half of sobriety from Xanax, I had to be actually be prescribed Xanax to combat my panic attacks and severe anxiety due to all this. Luckily, by the grace of god, after being on heart medication and bed rest for a little over a month, it turns out that I was misdiagnosed, and I actually had a rare heart virus called myocarditis. By the grace of god, I had recovered. After all this, I realized after a year of not going out or partying or anything, that life is too short and I got back into it. Going out and partying, doing cocaine alcohol to ketamine was very common on the weekends. I’m trying to slow down with that at this point and am doing a good job, my school work and amazing girlfriend kind of keep me in check. But, I have been on Xanax since then due to my panic attacks that I still frequently have, I have trouble breathing to due to my anxiety, and Xanax is the only thing that works to stop it. I have my life completely together, but I’m still taking Xanax and increasing my dose, I’m in a very blurred line in weather I actually need it or not, you can imagine how this makes me feel after being sober from it for so long to actually “needing it”. I’m taking NO WHERE NEAR as I was back then, but I just don’t know what to do. I still work out all the time and in great shape, and doing amazing in school, but since the incident with my heart, anxiety and panic attacks have taken over my life, and I hide it very well from friends. I don’t know what to do.

A year ago I realized that I was caught in the trap of the mind. There is a space in you that is actually just awareness of thought. I had forgotten that space. It's the space that just is BEING, like when you were a child just playing and not thinking about anything. Not even the next moment. I lived from the thoughts of the mind. The desires. I woke up in the morning, and my mind took me straight over with thoughts of dread and a plan how I would be able to drink that day and still somewhat function. Even though I knew choosing to do so would come with the low of guilt and shame. High, low, high, low, just watching it all. 

In the A.A. book, one sentence said to get sober, you have to be smart. 

I was 42 and considered myself smart, or so I thought. I had a B.A. in Education. That one line really pissed me off. It got to me. How dare you say I am dumb for innocently becoming addicted to alcohol? You don't know my childhood, my pain, my anger. I have a right to feel so horrible that I drink to feel better! 

Oh. I see. Yes, I am smart. I can see the cycle. I see what I am doing. You can always see what you are doing. You are not the mind. Being smart means acknowledging where you stand. Either you stand in the mind, or you stand back and watch it. I like being smart. I like being sober. I like being free.

I've been taking Phenergan and Restavit (both antihistamines) to help me sleep for the past 14 years. I'd take increasing doses of Phenergan each night, reach the maximum recommended dose, then start on the Restavit (as I developed a tolerance to both).

I've been studying sleep on and off for the past year, and saw a sleep psychologist for about 5 sessions. I have put a number of things in place, with the final step being to get off these sleeping pills. I tapered down to the minimum dose of both, dealing with sleepless nights at times. Then I got down to just having the minimum dose of Restavit each night for a few weeks. I then managed to skip a day a week for a few weeks.

Then, a week ago, I went off them completely. I was hoping to avoid withdrawal symptoms but I am feeling so ill. My body aches and itches everywhere, my brain is cloudy and achy, my throat is swollen, I'm getting pains just under my ribcage, in my sides and in my stomach, and I'm constantly feeling nauseous and lethargic.

\- See whether anyone has been through this before (what was your experience like? how long did your withdrawal symptoms last? what helped you to get through it?)
