He is 40 and hasn't improved much. 
He was an addict for years when I was between the ages of 2 to 8. That was in the early 2000's. My parents never exposed me to the perils the family went through, but my mother explained to me what was going on with simple words, so that a 7 year old would understand. He was committed a couple times but he never had the intention of staying sober. His younger brother suffered seeing that, and my aunt and uncle even more. 
It took me years to understand what went down with him, and there are so many things I still don't know. But here's the sitch: I think he's using again. Or maybe he never really stopped. My aunt is afraid of that too, and one time she broke down crying in front of my mother because he was hanging out with sketchy people and would get them in the house. 
I may be naive but I've seen people recovering from addiction when I got committed in a mental facility for my depression, and it was terrifying and heart wrenching.
He has specific patterns of behaviour: fits of violence, anger against his mother or father or anyone who tries to be in control, erratic behaviour, not wanting to go to the doctor (he didn't get vaccinated), refusing to do therapy, inability to keep a bond or romantic relationship, being unemployed his whole life, lack of interest in getting a job or studying something. 
I don't want this to end badly, are there any other specific signs of relapse? What can I do to intervene? How do you help someone who doesn't want to get help?

Mostly because I was able to beat it almost immediately because school was taking too much of my time away to game (during the weekdays) and also because newer games kinda suck and in totality (am I using that word right?) gaming sucks. All I did was give my PS4 to my brother; it‚Äôs in his room now. And I haven‚Äôt touched it since. That is not to say I don‚Äôt partake in gaming at all anymore but the gaming I do partake in is on my Nintendo switch. Which I don‚Äôt really touch at all unless I want to get some Tetris 99 games in. 

With that addiction beaten I have began to realize the far worse and far harder to beat and most detrimental addiction that has most harmed my life. That is social media (Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit, although Reddit not so much as before). I find myself constantly refreshing my feed to see the newest tweets, the newest Xqc react videos, and constantly flipping between those. Even when there is nothing to see. I‚Äôll just do that. Very mind numbing. Very bad. But how do I beat it? I have books that could take up the time I waste on Twitter and YouTube, but I don‚Äôt. Honestly I feel as if playing video games would be time better spent. 

And I can‚Äôt really just do the same thing I did to the PS4 because I am very addicted. I remember when not too long ago I had no internet for like a week. I was losing my mind. I had a book I was reading as well during that time, but I had not even cracked it open once. This addiction is so bad. I could be doing my homework during this time.

I called his mom to see if she could shed some light on the situation. She said that he sometimes asked her for cash (even though they are struggling financially). After a decently long conversation, she mentioned that they have given him some pills from time to time because his back was hurting. She mentioned it as an afterthought. Like the thought hadn't occurred to her that it was wrong or that he shouldn't have them. I explained to her that he can't casually take pills when he's in pain because he can't control his addiction. She said she understood and that she wouldn't give him anymore. I hope that's true. 

I finally spoke to my husband again after he blew my phone up all morning, then turned his off out of spite when I wouldn't answer.

I told him I spoke to his Mom and he said he knew. That instead of going to work he drove down there to vent. With a shaky voice, he told me he was sorry and that he would just leave. I told him I don't want him to leave, I want him to stop. He said he wanted that to. That he never had to be accountable. He said that he was ashamed and embarrassed. I reminded him that I agreed to help him in any way I could.

 I told him that we needed to talk so he should come home. He told me he really needed to go to work. I told him then I'll drive down to his parents then, to talk. He said he was about to leave and we could talk tonight. 

I'm not sure what to do next. I don't want him to leave, but I'm so tired of the deceit and being neglected. I already have one failed marriage, and I'm only 34. I was about to say that we have built a great life together otherwise...but in all honesty. ""I"" have built a great life for us. I..got us out of debt working three jobs. I...built a business from scratch that is our main source of income. I...planned, saved, and orchestrated for two years so that we could buy our dream home, that we now live in. I...plan our live, finances, make our house a home, clean, cook, organized, worry, stress, etc.. I know I can do it alone. I'm not stuck. I just don't want to. I don't want to put our kids through another broken home (we don't have kids together but we each have kids from previous marriages). I don't want to fail again. I don't want to hurt each of our families again. I don't want to be alone. He is kind and sensitive, a great Dad, and emotionally supportive and believe it or not..light-years better than my narcissistic ex. I just miss our old life. When I was a priority, when he was vibrant, and engaged. I'm sorry..I know I'm just rambling now. But this is how I'll be all day, until I can talk to him. 


UPDATE TWO: It didn't go well this morning. I asked him to give me the cash in his wallet and I would transfer it back to his account to use on his debit card. He absolutely refused. He couldn't give me a reason for why he needed it. Just that he needed it to prove to me that he wouldn't spend it. Which makes no fucking sense. I told him calmly that there was no reason for him to need cash unless he wanted to continue to be sneaky. He was being really unreasonable and refused..got super defensive. So I blew up...I know that was the wrong move. I told him if he wanted to keep living here he was to use no cash and he needed to take a drug test. NOW he is saying he isn't taking a drug test. That he only agreed to do that because he was high. I don't freaking know man... he clearly has no intentions of changing but this seriously fucks up our whole lives.





UPDATE ONE: 

I'm new to reddit and I'm not sure how best to update. I had a conversation with him tonight. I calmly approached him and stated that I'm not mad, and I will help him however I need to, but I need him to be honest. He told me that he hasn't been using pills but has been using a weed vape for a long time. He said he hates it, and it makes him feel terrible, and he wants to quit. That he does it all day long, and it doesn't even do anything for him. He gave me what he had, and I threw it away. I told him I wanted him to take a drug test, to assure me that that's all he's been doing, and he said he would. What do you all think? I'm not knowledgeable enough about symptoms and side effects of the weed vapes. I wasn't even aware they were legal here. Would they cause these effects? Or did I just fall for the lesser of two evils? He seemed very sincere that this was it.


ORIGINAL POST:
I'm afraid my husband of 9 years is using again. He had a pill addiction before we were together. For the most part he has remained clean, however he did relapse a few years ago for a short period, and he did have an addiction to Kratom for a while. 

I'm sorry for giving so little backstory..there is so much more to it, but I'm afraid it would be too much to explain.

I'll be honest...I'm very trusting and gullible by nature.  So I'm sort of easily manipulated. Not to mention I hate confrontation. But I can't tell if my trust is just too broken or if these are actual red flags. 

Here's a few reasons why I'm concerned. 

He's been sneaky about cash. He has been on a cash ""allowance"" for years because we were on a strict budget, getting out of debt (partially acquired from his kratom addiction), and he isn't great with money. I recently opened a separate account just for him because he kept accidentally swiping our card for his work expenses. 

He still goes by the atm and takes cash out of his account instead of just swiping his debit card. He takes ALL of it out. He also used our family account at the grocery store the other day, and when the charge hit the account, it was way more than I expected. So, I decided to check the receipt. 
I found it torn in tiny pieces in the trash...and saw that he got cash back. I asked him why, and he said with prices going up, it's hard for him to make the budget work, and he just wanted a little extra. 
So...I told him I would give him more money and to stop being sneaky. But then Valentines Day rolled around...

He also always gets cash out of our family account around holidays, anniversaries, etc. under the guise of using it to buy me gifts. However, the gifts never equal the amount, OR they wind up being something he ordered online and didn't use cash for at all. This was the same deal at Valentines Day. 

He also goes to meet his enabling mom multiple times a month, saying he's,""helping her, picking something up for her, giving her money because they are struggling financially,"" etc. His parents, though lovely people, will give him anything he wants...including drugs. Because they are the ones that gave him pills the last time he relapsed.

The last thing that has me the most concerned is he NEVER feels good. We have a non exsistant sex life, he never wants to go anywhere or do anything. He always either ""has a migraine"" or ""his stomach is messed up"" or ""his back hurts"" or more recently, ""his allergies are killing him"". It's literally, and I'm not exaggerating..every single effing day. My parents just came to visit and we both love when they come, we always have a blast with them. He barely engaged with them, saying his allergies were bothering him. He stayed in the room all weekend and didn't engage at all. My parents noticed he was acting differently and wondered what was going on. 

It's not just his allergies, because if it wasn't allergies, it would've been something else. Our last date night ended early because he had a stomach ache. We drove an hour to one of our favorite restaurants, then I wanted to look around at some stores and just hang out. As soon as we finished eating, he didn't feel good. I wound up going into target by myself for 10 minutes, getting back in the car, and we drove home. Not to mention, he flaked on another bigger day trip I planned because he was too tired to go. I got ready and walked up to him to ask if he was going to get ready too. He said he didn't feel like it, and we would go tomorrow. This was literally the perfect day to go. We had no kids, no work, and no time limit. The next day would've been rushed and unpracticle. So I said forget it and I went to a closer destination by myself. I was heartbroken because I had been looking forward to it all week. 

Does this sound like he has relapsed again? What do I do? I'm afraid he's just going to lie if I don't have proof. Please help.",15,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9810736179351807}"

He's still alive, but he isn't the person I thought he was.","I fell in love with my friend. I knew he had issues with drinking and drugs, particularly cocaine. There's also the nicotine and gambling but those are child's play in comparison to the devil's drug that is cocaine. I partake in weed and alcohol only. And would not consider myself an addict. I didn't know how deep his addictions were. But I loved him anyways. It was a foolish endeavour but my heart couldn't say no to him. He pursued me, slowly, as friends. A great friendship formed between us. He's such a smart, great, funny, charismatic, good looking guy. Even after the terrible things he's done I can't stop seeing him as such. After a while our friendship escalated to hooking up and hanging out, maybe once a week, sometimes less. But we talked more deeply than people who were just hooking up. He confided his problems in me. he opened up to me about his struggles, goals, values; as did I. He slowly got things to be more serious.

Before I knew it, he was my boyfriend. There was concerns on both sides. Problems. Always due to cocaine or drinking. The blackouts. Being scared for my life at times. Not knowing when he'd bail on me or not answer. Stories he'd tell me about terrible things he did while he was fucked up or seeing said things before my own eyes. But he promised he would stop and stay clean. He promised he'd get help after a particularly bad black out that ended up in me getting hurt. I trusted him, maybe too much. Love him, maybe too much.

Things are great for a while. I envision a beautifull future together because I thought he was staying clean. We even talk about having kids. Go on trips together. Have some great adventures. Then comes this weekend. Just under a year into us being officially together. This is a week after we have an amazing and special date together that was just perfect. he's on another bender (not the first, unfortunately probably won't be the last). Ignores my calls for days. Doesn't text me back.

I'm concerned. I think, foolishly, that this is his first relapse since the last bout of staying clean - he actually did have a period while we were together of several months off the drugs. though with drinking he never stayed away for more than a month. But overall he was starting to look a lot healthier and happier, or so I thought? We finally speak on the phone and he sounds high as hell. This doesn't surprise me, but breaks my heart. We eventually breakup. Unlike other stories I read online, there was no name calling. No blame on my side. No yelling. No gas lighting. He says I deserved the best, he's heart broken he couldn't truly be who I needed. That he couldn't keep up with the monster inside him. I urge him to get help, even though he won't have my support anymore. Tell him that he never will because I'm in so much pain. Pain that's existed since the beginning of our hook up days, all the way to our relationship getting more serious.

But I feel really confused. We had several nights a week together. He works long hours and I know this for a fact so I don't even know how he hast the time to manage both that, life in general, and getting high. He's the definition of a high functioning addict. I have no idea how somebody sleeping in your bed has the ability to hide drug use in plain sight. I had a feeling he would relapse but I literally had no idea when it happened - I made him admit when, he says it was months ago but I only knew about it recently. Maybe it was because we had ""cover drugs"", we often drank together or he'd show up already have drank, and we both smoke weed. He also lied before about not doing coke and silly me, he fooled me again.

Today is the day I walked away from this relationship. I'm choosing myself. My depression and anxiety (not caused by him) cannot handle anything more. He says over and over that I'm amazing but knows I deserve better. He's still my best friend in my heart but he's not the person I painted him out to be. The demons inside him took over. Addiction is heart breaking. I will always care about him and hope the best for him. I still think of him as a good person.

Please if you are struggling, get any kind of help. Therapy, NA, AA, rehab, anything is a step in the right direction. If you fall in love with an addict, you can't make them get help or stay clean. Only they can make that choice. I'm sure you know that, but I thought my love could help him. it only made him lie and hide things because he didn't want to lose me. I'm devastated. My best friend is gone. But maybe he was never really here.",27,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9944544434547424}"

He got prescribed to both vyvanse and adderall. Which is where all the addictions started once our son was born. 
He would finish a whole bottle of vyvanse in a week and then withdrawal. I started getting resentful because he was sleeping all the time and I never got a break. I felt so lonely, on top of ppd in a pandemic. He was drinking more and more too when he was taking the vyvanse. 
Things started to get abusive, I was being lied to constantly, he even bruised me and pushed me down the stairs in front of our 1 year old at one point during a withdrawal. 
I tried telling his psychiatrist and his psychiatrist didn‚Äôt do anything helpful. Even chose to believe him and mansplained things to me (a child of a psychologist) which I‚Äôm actually very educated in Vyvanse and adderall and the chances of addiction.

Rapid heart beat, sweats, nausea, tremors, and a few shots of leftover vodka from the night before. This is how my mornings have started for the last 5 years. You never think you‚Äôll get to that point. You tell yourself ‚Äú that will never happen to me. I‚Äôll never be ‚Äúhair of the dogging it‚Äù in the morning before driving to work to teach America‚Äôs youth.‚Äù That is the thing about working with kids. 5 year olds come crying to you because someone isn‚Äôt sharing with them, or refuses to let them join in their game and it just makes you feel like shit because their problems are so insignificant compared to yours. You wish the worst thing about your day was a friend deciding to play with someone else over you, and it could be, so to speak. But your problems are much more serious, and they are self-inflicted. And now, you are dealing with what I call ‚Äú little people problems‚Äù, in a hungover, shaky nauseous state, knowing everything that you know. Everything that you keep showing yourself time and time again. You also know that you could easily have far less significant problems if you would only get your shit together. Even just a little bit.

This state of complete misery and self-inflicted despair can happen so easily, yet, you also have to work really hard at being miserable to get there. You have to become really fucking good at being miserable. And that is what I did. I have no idea how I let myself get there. From a logical standpoint, I analyze the patterns and can see exactly how I got there. But from the same exact logical standpoint that makes the picture clear, I still can‚Äôt see how I LET myself get there. They say that some of the most intelligent people become addicts. That is what makes it so crippling. It‚Äôs not like I am a wallflower blissfully unaware that what I am doing to myself and my body is without consequence. I see the train wreck. I feel the heat from the fire on my skin as I approach it. The same fire that would be wreaking havoc on my body, burning me from the inside, and the heat from it that would be escaping from my body in the form of copious amounts of sweat evaporating from my skin as I go through withdrawal yet again. The crash and burn is always inevitable, expected, and right down the road. For a long time I kept driving straight towards it full speed ahead, the only form of pumping the brakes being adding more poison to my body to put off the inevitable, even if just for a little while longer. I knew tomorrow brought the consequence at hand, but I kept living that day like the next would never come.

I‚Äôm not going to sit here and list off all the reasons, or excuses as I call them now as to why I became an addict. I became an addict because I was unable to cope with the same problems most people have. I allowed literally every day life to become an excuse to come home, drink a 5th of vodka every night, wake up, ‚Äúhair of the dog it‚Äù, pop some pills, snort some cocaine, smoke a cigarette and do it all over again. The funny thing about when you start drinking to deal with everyday problems, is the problems you thought you had are minuscule compared to the ones that begin to take on a life of their own as a result of your addiction. The other funny thing is you tell yourself it is okay to feel ‚Äúwoe is me‚Äù once you actually have real problems that you yourself created, and that is another excuse to keep drinking. It‚Äôs an endless cycle of crash and burn. A fire you fall right onto, get back out of, and fall right back onto it again.

You do this for a while with somewhat minimal consequences, but consequences nonetheless. Consequences that you are willing to put up with as long as you get to keep drinking. But after a while, the consequences inevitably get more and more real.

First you lose your group of friends. Your partner loses them too in his effort to stick by your side and do the right thing. After all, they are only half right about your problem at this point. For real, that part was true. They were right, however, about how it eventually ended up.

Then you lose that partner. The one you were supposed to marry, and spend the rest of your life with. He can‚Äôt handle your problem anymore. The lying about it, the effect it is having on your life and everything he has lost because of it. This, of course, makes it acceptable to drink more. Because woe is you. Now you have an actual ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù reason to drink. So you do.

Then you lose your job. You oversleep one too many times from getting absolutely obliterated the night before, and your boss calls you to tell you the jig is up, and you sort of numbly accept it. And yes, you drink more.

You drink more for months, while on unemployment and eventually, somehow land a new job. Working with the little people, and their insignificant little people problems. The drinking gets a little better for a while. But just a little bit. At this point, appearances are merely barely being kept up. You‚Äôre still hungover and sick almost every day, and are mediocre at your job at best, but you are even lucky to have one at this point.

This continues for over a year. And we add in a pandemic, which causes a furlough, large amounts of unemployment money, which obviously allows for copious amounts of drinking, cocaine, and even more benzos than you were taking before. Oh, and irresponsible dangerous sex with strangers, including but not limited to sleeping with a felon for drugs. You can‚Äôt even remember all of them, and have lost count of how many of them there have been at this point. This makes you feel worse about yourself, but you‚Äôre still not ready to change, so you keep the train rolling. All night long.

Eventually, you get called back to work, and while you‚Äôre happy to be going back, now you have to sober up, and you have about a week to sober up and detox yourself down to a more acceptable level of drinking so that you can function better at work than you did before. You manage to do it, for a little while. But then your hours get cut due to the pandemic and low numbers of kids actually coming to school in person. You‚Äôre just not needed as much as you once were, so you start drinking even more heavily once again to cope with the stress of reduced income, and this is when the levee first breaks.

You end up in the ER. Your best friend, who is also an alcoholic, convinces you that you need to put yourself there because you can‚Äôt stop, and the withdrawal would be too dangerous at this point to go through at home. You are also out of benzos, with no way to get more, so it kind of feels like the end of the road. She also calls your parents for you to let them know the situation, since they have no idea you even have this problem to the extent that you do. Your dad calls you, tells you to take a leave of absence from work, go to the ER to get detoxed and prepare to be spending a month on lockdown at their house while you do outpatient rehab. You do as he says, and you almost feel a weird sense of relief that someone else has taken over the situation for you. You call work, tell them you need a medical leave of absence, and shamefully ask your roommate to take you to the ER.

You spend about half a day in the ER, being pumped full of fluids, and that sweet IV Ativan that takes away all the pain of withdrawal. Also that equally sweet phenobarbital. This is a new drug, one you haven‚Äôt tried yet, and while you know it's finally time to get sober, you can‚Äôt help but think about how nice it feels, and how a run with phenobarbital might be nice as well. Thankfully, they send you home with a few days' worth when you are discharged, and this makes detox relatively painless, but detox isn't the hard part at this point. Now you have to deal with the wrath of your parents, and figure out how to deal with life sober and finally face all the consequences from the years of bad decisions you made while you were using and drinking.

Somehow, you manage to get through the month with your parents. You get through the outpatient rehab, and actually take it kind of seriously this time. You get something out of it. You also get through sleeping on the air mattress in their extra living room, the pain your mother is experiencing because of what you have done. The yelling fights, the crying fights, the trying to run away back to your own place because the shit your parents have to say to you is mean, and too real, but also everything you absolutely need to hear. You hear it, it hurts, it's over, but their words continue to haunt you. They let you go home, you go back to work, deal with the shame that everyone somehow figured out what happened to you, but no one talks about it except the people you are actually close to, so it is tolerable.

But do you stay sober? No. of course not. Not yet anyways, you still aren't ready to change. You thought that was rock bottom? It wasn‚Äôt. That has yet to come. It is better than before, you aren't getting as obliterated, you aren't going through withdrawal, but you're still lying to your parents about it through your teeth every day on the phone when you call them every day to check in for the sole purpose of assuring them that you are staying sober. Lying to the people who are financially, and emotionally supporting you, and who just went through hell trying to get you sober. This guilt does get you to drink considerably less, and sometimes you don‚Äôt drink at all, but you still are doing it sometimes. And now you have made a new group of friends, so things are looking up, but even though they aren‚Äôt big drinkers, or users, being in a social setting every Friday night gives you the perfect excuse to drink, even if they are not.

Life seems pretty good for a while. The new friends really improve the quality of your life. Having friends is something you don‚Äôt realize is important to you until you have them again after a period of being completely alone with yourself. You tell yourself you don‚Äôt need them, but you do and they give you something to look forward to every Friday night. You‚Äôre doing considerably better at your job too, and people are noticing.

Then you and your roommate get Covid. You are forced to quarantine for two weeks, miss work, are incredibly sick, and are cut off from the social group that has been breathing life back into you. In your fucked up all or nothing junkie way of thinking, you catastrophize the situation, forget everything you learned in rehab, and somehow manage to convince yourself that you‚Äôll never be able to see your friends again. So even though you are sick as fuck with Covid, you go on the final bender that almost kills you, and lands you back in the emergency room. Your same alcoholic best friend actually calls 911 on you because you threaten to kill yourself because it literally seems like the most logical option at this point. The drinking has gotten so bad, you're out of benzos, and the withdrawal will probably kill you this time anyways since it has only been a few hours since your last drink and you‚Äôre already on the brink of a seizure and cannot stop throwing up. You‚Äôve kindled yourself so badly this time and you know it, and to say you are in a world of hurt is an understatement. Also, if you go to the ER for detox, your parents will absolutely find out somehow, and then it is really over. They have already been through so much in regards to your addiction, how can you let them down again? Suicide is looking like a pretty viable option, you even start making a plan, but for some reason, you stop yourself and you decide to call your best friend instead. She puts your ass back in the ER via a lovely ride in an ambulance, and calls your dad again because she is a saint, and is good at softening the blow that this will be to your family.

When you get to the ER it is entirely different than the last time. You‚Äôre put into a room almost right away, and never left alone because of the whole wanting to kill yourself thing. You get hooked up to IV‚Äôs in both arms, and get the same sweet Ativan and phenobarbital as before, but in lower doses, and the withdrawal is still miserable. In addition to this, you are sent for CT scans because you are sick with Covid, and you‚Äôre in pretty rough shape in general. Your test results come back showing you have lactic acidosis, and your liver, while still okay, has taken a beating. They keep you on a 51/50 for three days, and start only giving you gabapentin to ease the withdrawal, which is effective in preventing seizures, but only helps so much with the other symptoms. You still can't eat, are shaky ,can't sleep, and can barely walk to the bathroom on your own. This is easily the sickest you have ever been in your life. And this is finally rock bottom.

Rock bottom looks and sounds like a lot of things. It looks like not being able to bathe yourself at 28 years old, and having a caring compassionate medical technician give you a sponge bath because you start to reek so bad that even she can't stand having to stay in your room with you all the time due to your 51/50. It looks like black and blue veins that are bruised so bad from having IV‚Äôs in you for three straight days. It looks like not being able to go home because your lactic acid levels are so high they don‚Äôt feel comfortable releasing you. It sounds like the constant beeping from all the heart monitors you are hooked up to due to your extremely elevated heart rate from withdrawal, and the IV monitors beeping because you can't keep your damn arms straight when you are trying to sleep. Which is a joke in the hospital anyways. It sounds like the genuinely concerned doctors, shrinks, and medical technicians telling you you WILL die if you keep doing this to yourself. Then you finally get stable enough to go home. They send you home with a regimen of Librium, and gabapentin, and you‚Äôre relieved to go home, but you‚Äôre still in the worst withdrawal you have ever experienced in your life despite the meds.

You have three days after being released from the hospital before you need to be back at work after your quarantine from Covid, and your arms are bruised to shit from the IVs. They look like you have been shooting dope even though that was never your drug of choice. You still can't sleep, and when you do, you are having the most terrifying nightmares you have ever had. So real, and in a loop so that when you finally do wake up, you are not even sure you are awake, and you have to get your extremely concerned roommate to convince you that you are awake. You have to get her to practically spoon feed you as well, since you can still barely eat.

But you‚Äôre one strong bitch, and you show up back to work on Monday, bruised arms and all. Looking like death, feeling like death, still not completely through the withdrawal. People notice. The friends that you do have at work that know your struggles are extremely concerned, and tell you after some time passes that they were shocked at the strength you exhibited in showing up and trying to do your job in the state you are in.

You are an anxious paranoid mess for about two weeks from PAWS, and then it finally starts to get better. You feel normal, and happy and are completely sober for the first time in ten years. You vow to never drink again, you're done with it, you know that you cannot put yourself back in that position you were in, because it will literally kill you. It feels like it has finally clicked, and you have a happy few weeks.

Then your best friend dies suddenly. The alcoholic one that saved your life so many times, and softened so many blows to your family for you. The only one that truly understood what you were going through because she had been through it too, for her whole life.

You got concerned when you didn't hear from her for three days, as you normally talk everyday and she hasn't returned your calls. Finally on day three you send the police to do a welfare check on her, and they find her dead in her apartment on the living room floor, from what appears to be natural causes. She was an older woman, close to retirement age, and she was not in good health, but you did not expect to lose her yet, or so suddenly.

Your world stops turning, but keeps turning at the same time. You‚Äôre newly sober, and you have to deal with really the only real loss you have ever experienced in your relatively short life. You know how fragile your state is right now, but that you have to just keep going. You have to go and deal with helping her family clear out her apartment because you‚Äôre the only friend she really had, and you knew her better than her own family. You find out she had been lying to you about her own sobriety when you see the state that her place was in. Alcohol bottles strewn about everywhere. You realize that she did this because she knew that if you knew she was drinking, you would have an excuse to drink as well. She was trying to hold you accountable, even though she couldn't hold herself accountable. This hurts your soul, but also makes you realize the love she had for you, and that in her older age, she didn‚Äôt have any hope for herself, but had hope for you to get sober and stay sober. She wanted you to live your life free from the chains of addiction. And you make this your new life mission. To live life for her, free from alcohol and drugs, because she didn't get the chance to. It finally did click. For real this time.

You reflect back and realize how fucked up it is that you almost had to die, and your best friend did have to die to get you to this point. But you realize that this is often how it goes for addicts trying to get their shit together. That is what rock bottom really looks like, and more often than not, that is what it takes for real change to happen, and for the real work to begin.

It‚Äôs been 6 months now, clean and sober. The longest period of sobriety you have had in ten years, since you were 19 years old. You‚Äôve lost 30 pounds just from cutting out the alcohol. You feel, and look completely different. You‚Äôre almost glowing, despite everything you have lost, you have learned to appreciate the simple things in life, like going to target, or baking and cooking, or having a cigarette and reading a book. You start writing again, feeling inspired and wanting to create again. For the first time in as long as you can remember, you have no desire or cravings for alcohol. The thought hardly ever even enters your mind anymore, and it is pure bliss to feel that freedom. A complete 180. You also get a new and better job, and start to pay off all the debt you acquired through your years of using and bad decision making. Your relationship with your family, and friends, is better than it has ever been because they can see your growth and change, and that it is real this time.

My mornings used to start with rapid heart beats, sweats, nausea, tremors, and a few shots of leftover vodka from the night before along with some benzos, and some cocaine. I never thought I would get to that point. I always told myself that it would never happen to me. Then the narrative switched to, ‚ÄúThis is just my life now. I‚Äôll never get sober‚Äù. But I did. I did it.

I mean, I‚Äôm sure my addiction issues stem from my depression and anxiety, but I think at this point the addiction thing is the first battle I need to fight. But basically this is my story (sorry it‚Äôs so long):

I‚Äôm a 33 yr old male, and in my early to mid 20‚Äôs I started experiencing what I would consider minor depression/anxiety. I never really got diagnosed or treated at that time, because it wasn‚Äôt really bad or frequent enough that I thought I could manage it. 

However, in my late 20‚Äôs I went through a divorce (for context, she was having an affair). A lot of manipulation and deceit were going on through this time, and my boss at the time (which was also kind of her boss at different location) knew a lot about what was going on. He offered me a promotion and a move to a new location in a different city. I was excited not only get a promotion, but also to get away from the environment that was growing increasingly toxic. 

Things were going pretty good for a while, but behind the excitement for a fresh start and new opportunities, was still a lot of pain, sadness, depression, and anxiety. Plus, with the move, I had moved further away from my family and friends, and my depression and anxiety was hindering me from forming new relationships and finding new friends. When I did find friends, I would eventually push them away, because of my insecurities. All of a sudden, I started having panic attacks with growing frequency. It was affecting my work performance and punctuality. Around this time, the company I worked for started offering us health insurance, so I did start to seek help. However, before I could really get anything done, I had a panic attack one night, woke up the next morning and I kinda just snapped and packed up my stuff and moved back home. 

Once again, I started to feel better, but there was always that underlying feeling that I have described previously. So one day, I was kind of having a bad day and a friend offered me something ‚Äúthat would help take the edge off‚Äù. It was xanax. To be honest, after taking that, I felt better than I had in years. Since I had left my job and no longer had insurance, I started seeking the stuff out. But I was young and dumb and was highly abusing it. It got to the point that if I ran out and couldn‚Äôt find any, seizures were imminent. After the third one, I realized I could not continue down that path. 

My family owns a business, so I ended up going to work for them in a different state. I got off the pills, and once again, things were looking up. A few years passed and I was doing really good. I was learning the business and excelling. The business was growing and improving, so my sister and her family moved out to help. It was great!

Then my dad‚Äôs health started to decline. We eventually found out it was cancer, but it had been growing for months unchecked. We still tried everything we could, but it was too late. After he passed, my anxiety/depression got severe. I got shingles at 30 y/o because of the stress. But not only myself, but my whole family was a mess. I did get into counseling, but I‚Äôve been in the hospitality industry since I graduated university, so it‚Äôs like second nature for me to just hide my real feelings, smile, and say all the right things. Plus, I think I have created this version of myself that I present to the world, and I can really only open up my true emotions to a select few people.

Then COVID happened and I started to do therapy by phone. Which made it even easier for me to stay closed up to my therapist, because she couldn‚Äôt see my body language. So one day, she said it seemed like I was doing pretty good, but at this point I think I was also fooling myself. So I was like ‚ÄúGreat, I‚Äôm good, maybe our work here is done.‚Äù But deep down I knew I wasn‚Äôt ok.

So here I go self medicating again, but I‚Äôm in a new state with no connections‚Ä¶ And this is the hardest part, and I hate myself for it, but I‚Äôve been stealing ambien from my own mother for a few years now. At first just once in a while, but the frequency started growing. And not just to go to sleep at night, I‚Äôm talking I was taking them in the middle of the day. It didn‚Äôt really make me sleepy, it just ‚Äútook the edge off.‚Äù For context, I come from three generations of males on my dad‚Äôs side with addictive personalities and functioning alcoholics. As they took to alcoholism, I guess I just took to pills. So even under the influence, I hide it well, still get my stuff done, and no one is the wiser. I‚Äôm a functioning pill addict.

In the past year or so, suicidal thoughts have start to set in. I have no plans to harm myself and have never taken any action, but I often wonder, ‚ÄúHow long can a person have these thoughts, before they actually do take action?‚Äù And I don‚Äôt want that. I love my family and friends, and we‚Äôve got a business that just gets better every year. I want to live, but I just don‚Äôt want to live like this with all this sadness, pain, anxiety and depression.

But stealing from my mother was killing me even more inside, so I started started seeking xanax again. I don‚Äôt abuse them like I used to, and even when I don‚Äôt have any, I have never had another seizure. But also when I don‚Äôt have any is when I start to steal the ambien again. And I can‚Äôt even say I‚Äôm addicted to a particular thing, I‚Äôm just addicted to anything that will alter my mental state. I need help and I know it, but I‚Äôm also scared because: 
1. I‚Äôve obviously fallen off the wagon before, so it just seems easier to stay off the wagon (if that makes sense)
2. I know once I really man up and take the necessary steps to ACTUALLY try this time, (i.e. not hiding things from my therapist, possible NA meetings, etc.) people will be holding me accountable, so once I cross that line, it will be even harder to go back. I know I need it and I‚Äôm only harming myself, but I‚Äôm an addict. So it‚Äôs like the reasonable side of me is like ‚Äúyeah bro, you need to get this under control and quick‚Äù but the addict side is like ‚ÄúNah bro, you want/need this, so ride this train as long as possible.‚Äù

And I guess ultimately the reason I‚Äôm coming here is because I have talked to my family and friends from time to time and they are acutely aware of my struggles, but I just feel like they can‚Äôt 100% relate, or even 10% relate. I hate the path I‚Äôm going down because it is a vicious cycle of temporarily masking my pain, which makes me feel better temporarily, but then I hate myself for doing it so it just continues and its piling up. I‚Äôve got a lot of pent up emotion and I‚Äôm a very emotional person anyway. So here lately, I just sometimes start crying randomly. Sometimes I wake up crying, sometimes I‚Äôll be driving and I just start crying, even hanging out with friends I‚Äôll just start crying. I know I need help, but I‚Äôm scared.",6,"{'covid': 1, 'mask': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9888699054718018}"

It feels like the worst thing I've ever done,"I relapsed today after over four years clean. I'm posting here because I have no one I can safely talk about this to at the moment.

Here the background. It's going to be a bit confused because I'm high right now. I'm 29 years old, and I started using pills/heroin when I was 20 years old. I stated using drugs to try to cope with my extreme anxiety and depression, PTSD from a sexual assault, and other stupid problems. At first I had a handle on it, but like usual it ended up ruining my life. Before this stretch of cleanness, the longest I had been clean was a whole year. It started getting really bad when I got my first real good job at a major IT company.

When I got the job at the IT company, the stress from the position and juggling my computer fixing business on the side overwhelmed me, along with the usual problems, and I tried to cope by using more drugs. I started shooting up for the first time when I worked there, and I started doing speedballs. My best friend and I were using together, and it started spiraling out of control. Finally I quit the job, told my parents, and my best friend quit using together with me. We started by going to a methadone clinic together, there were stops and starts, but finally we both got totally clean four years and a few months ago. We tapered off the methadone and got our lives back on track in various ways. She did a much better job of getting her life together than I did though.

Ever since I got clean I got terrified of having spending money. I had my parents control my income until about a year and a half ago. That's when I lost my job and only worked my computer fixing side gigs, but at much reduced rate. I was seeing a therapist until a few months ago, when my therapist moved to another country. I was terrified of opening up myself to someone new, so dragged my feet and didn't find another one. I still see a psychiatrist though. I've been pretty much a total shut in.

Today I gave into the urge and drove to the city, bought a few bags, and snorted one when I got home. I feel absolutely horrible about it. After using I flushed the rest down the toilet. It was so pointless, and I feel so guilty I can't stand it. I've betrayed everyone's trust in me for absolutely nothing. I want to repent so badly, but I know if I tell anyone it'll become a nightmare, I just can't stand to see my mother weep. My immediate plan is to find a new therapist immediately so I can get things back on track, and try to repair the damage I've done. I feel so guilty and horrible I can't stand it. I never want to use again and can't believe I actually relapsed, it was so stupid and dangerous.

I don't know where to go from here. I'm still in shock that I actually went through with it. Sorry for the long post, I just needed to tell someone somehow.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9997298121452332}"

Even prior to us dating(4 years). It's a really tough addiction to let go of because with in reason, any kink you could have could be satisfied in like 10 minutes.

My bigger issue is that I'll end up edging for like 30 minutes and then finally finding that perfect moment to just, release to.

Like I work from home. I wake up at 6:30. I Go to the bathroom. Then sit on the toilet and edge for like 30 min to even an hour. Log in for work then pop another one off before lunch maybe even 2+3 more before lunch.

I feel like such a degenerate. Counting the hours lost to porn. I really messed up when I created an account and then started aimlessly compiling a mega list of quickies.

I have some sexual assault trauma from 4-5 that's  made me very hypersexual. The first consentual sex act I did was at 10. Then I started masterbating 4-20+. Like I hurt myself a few times but the slightest wind would set me off.

Fast forward to college and I meet drives of people that are into so, many, things... And I'm like yes let's try it all and then I'd still end the night with porn.

I love my fianc√©e and am attracted to her but some of the things in into are just consentually degrading and it's weird. I respect her too much to do anything like that to her. But I can't help that when these thoughts come of of what I've done in the past it turns me on. 

We have sex 1-2 times per week. She's offered to open our relationship up but again, I respect her way too much and I don't want her to be hurt. There wouldn't be any going back from that so I just wouldn't.

But then here I am at Thanksgiving thinking about her aunt in ways that I absolutely shouldn't... My therapist tells me it's my OCD. Like me telling myself that I I don't want to do this and omg this would be the worst thing I could ever do. So I can't help but think about it and then it just gets so, awkward. Like I just shut down.

Am I always going to be reduced to acting on caveman, smooth brain urges? I usually dislike myself afterwards and 80% of the time I don't even get the dope boost...

I'm also sure my mother drank when she was pregnant with me... I definitely recall her giving me a beer as she bounced me in her arms. We were living in a section 8 building that was 30+ floors high. We were pretty high up and she had these hoop earrings in. I was frying and I remember the cold beer hitting me. I'm almost certain she was trying to put me to sleep so she could sneak off.

(22yrs old) I solved all my problems except my treatment resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Ive tried multiple meds of every class of medication except MAO inhibitors. TMS (trans cranial magnetic stimulation) made my suicidal thoughts VERY severe. 

My MDD gets so severe that when I drove my mom to my doctors appointment she saw how badly it impaired my driving. I drove better drunk and high than I do now. My neurons are f*****

I think of relapse many times a day due to feeling so dead inside. Its hard doing basic tasks. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I am going to get Ketamine under the supervision of a doctor through IV transfusions. But there are times where I do not want to be sober at all and cannot find reasons why. I didn‚Äôt have any DUIs (though I definitely could‚Äôve had one) or major consequences. It was me who went to my parents about my addiction and staged my own intervention because I knew my life and dreams would be ruined if I didn‚Äôt stop early. This is something I am very proud of. 

But a part of me inside says even when I get better I feel like I‚Äôm not ready for sobriety. Its so messed up. Because in the beginning I was so excited for this new life. I think a part of this is my MDD because depression can get so severe your cognition can get impaired. I have my doctor appointment for Ketamine on Monday but everyday is so hard. I‚Äôve been fighting for so long against addiction and my MDD and I‚Äôm exhausted from it.

The other day I had one that was particularly frightening; I woke up and had to remind myself that it was just a dream and that I was still sober. It was awful; a very suffocating and despairing feeling. 

I've never felt close to relapsing when I have these nightmares, though. Rather I've noticed that they happen when I'm stressed or feeling like I'm not in control of something (i.e., work feeling unpredictable and overwhelming).

But I've been told that tapering could be a good way to get clean so I feel like I gotta tell the specifics now. 

So, I've been taking 15mg of imovane for a few months every other or third day. So, it's a pretty heavy dose and it basically ruins two days because I'm like a zombie the next day. 

But the withdrawals are getting a bit much because I know that I start getting cravings every day. So, tapering. 

I halved the dose yesterday and I actually felt fine for once! I did get a little high towards the night because 7.5mg (one pill) is still a bit much for me apparently. 

But, I have 15mg left before I have to meet my dealer to get more again. I'm lowkey scared of meeting him because I might get too much and then comes the classic ""well, one binging night isn't that bad"". But that's also a very short taper since some website talked about a week or two.

So, my plan is that I'm gonna take 7.5mg today and split it into two and take one half at like 2PM and the other one at 6PM. And then for the next two days, half a pill. Or maybe skip monday and take the half at tuesday. I feel like this won't feel good, but do you think it can still work?

TLDR; is a 4-5 day taper way too fast and should I get more from my dealer even at the risk of relapse?

Edit: maybe I'll update this thread during the next four days? 

Day 1 (yesterday) went well like I said before. 

Day 2 is going okay so far and it's 12PM. Thanks to my lower dose yesterday, the rebound effect is really small and I finally finished my short essay for my school project. Some cravings but I might take half a pill in two hours and see how that feels. 

I don't think I had to take the other half but I wanted it.. and I did. Not sure how I feel about that

Day 3 is doing okay at 12PM again. I have a weird headache, but some coffee and a painkiller will fix that. I wanted to try and skip one day to lengthen this taper a little, but I feel like I'll just go ""well, according to my original plan, I'm allowed to use a little"". 

I did take the pill and I feel like I'm going insane because time is moving **so slowly**! I've looked at the clock 10 times. How is it still 5PM???",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988827109336853}"

His brother committed suicide just before we reconnected two years ago. I was going through a terrible divorce and was constantly partying and using too. Once we started dating we both kind of just stopped with the party scene and stuck to smoking Marijuana. I got pregnant and stopped using any substances completely. Shortly after, He confided in me that he cheated on me and that he was using percocet. We broke up then he got clean for almost two months then we got back together. 
Fast forward 11 months, Went through his phone and found out he has been using again. I showed him the evidence and he broke down and promised he'll get sober, said if i leave him he'll end his life. There's also an issue of him getting a large amount of money coming to him soon.

Things are starting to spiral, snapping at me for the smallest things, the money issues, sneaky behavior. He has said he's willing to get help but bails when we discuss it or make appts.

&#x200B;

**Background:** I just graduated from college and I am living at home this spring until I start medical school in August. My dad recently retired in November of 2020 after a job he had for 36 years, and all he seems to do is watch TV from dawn until midnight and drink. *I have noticed these behaviors since the summer of 2020, but now living at home,  I am even more aware now of the dangerous additional behaviors he partakes in, and the red flags these behaviors are raising to me.*

**CONCERNING BEHAVIORS:** 

**1.)** **He actively tries to hide how much he is drinking from us:**

My dad will openly drink wine or beer every night with dinner, and then openly drink more beer/mixed whiskey drinks in the evening and night while watching TV. However, there have been a few occasions now I have walked in on him drinking in the middle of the day, and he has gotten upset and flustered at me for this. 

**a.)** I walked into the garage at 2 pm on a Tuesday to throw something in the recycle bin, and he was in there pouring whiskey into his tumbler. This bottle of whiskey I discovered is different from the ones he keeps in the fridge upstairs and in the basement. This is one he keeps hidden under towels in a draw in the garage. After I walked in on him doing this, he got mad at me and yelled at me for being in the garage, and become very flustered.

**b.)** He often watches TV in the basement during the afternoon, and one afternoon I went down there to clean out the cat's litter box (he is lazy and says he does it when he actually hasn't cleaned it). Upon walking downstairs, I saw him sitting in the recliner with three empty beer cans by him. When he saw that I had walked downstairs he immediately grabbed them and tried to shove them in the drawer of the table next to him. But he wasn't fast enough and I saw. 

**c.** My brother has an apartment for college and after his graduation ceremony this spring, my mom, dad, and I had to wait in his apartment for him to come back from the ceremony. While we were waiting on the porch, my dad goes inside to use the bathroom. I go inside ten minutes later to use the bathroom and found him sitting on the couch in my brother's living room chugging pounder he had taken from my brother's fridge. *He had no way to know if this was my brother's or his roommates, and I do not know why his first impulse after watching my brother graduate college was to sneak away and chug beer.* 

&#x200B;

**2.) Not including the drinks he hides from us, he drinks 4-6 drinks nightly:**

I know this could be worse, but he starts drinking so early in the afternoon too. There is no reason to be drinking whiskey at 1 pm on a Tuesday afternoon while you watch the news. He openly will drink 4-6 drinks in front of my mom and me throughout the evening, but I suspect the total is more now that I know he is hiding from us some of his drinking throughout the day.

**3.) Drinking is the first thing he turns to after doing anything:**

Even if it is just running errands, the first thing he does when he gets home from anywhere is going to the fridge downstairs and get a beer. He drinks them fairly quickly, within three minutes, and will promptly go and get another one. *On one occasion, we had just driven four hours to a hotel to stay at for my brother's college graduation. Before even helping my mom and I unpack everything, his first impulse was to have 2-3 beers from the* ***!!! 3 12 packs !!! h****e had brought, even though we were only staying two nights.* 

**4.) He will drive after drinking:**

He did this tonight. He was drinking wine in the basement before dinner, then had dinner (was clearly drunk throughout dinner) and then left to drive to a high school basketball game. He does this more than I would like- drink, get clearly drunk, try to hide that he is drunk, then go off somewhere. We have tried to confront him before, but he gets defensive and says he is fine when he clearly is not. A part of me hopes he crashes or gets a DUI so he can see that he has a problem. 

**5.) He can get angry when he drinks:**

I avoid him now when he drinks, but one time when he was drunk and drinking he asked me to pass him the TV remote. I accidently dropped it during the handoff, and he proceeded to pick the remote up, throw it at me, and start screaming to be about what an ungrateful bitch I was.   

He also tends to scream at me for ""walking too loudly"" when he is drinking.

**6.) His drinking is driving me and my one brother away:**

I am a triplet with two brothers. Because of my dad's drinking, my one brother never wants to be home. And when he is home he locks himself in his room to stay away from my dad. I also exhibit this behavior. I will leave the house if my dad is drinking, or lock myself in my room because his drinking makes me extremely uncomfortable.

**7.) Alcoholism and liver cancer run on his side of the family:** 

His grandfather was a Polish immigrant and coal miner and was also a HEAVY alcoholic. He died of liver cancer. My dad's father (my pap-pap) in turn never drank, since he grew up with an alcoholic dad. However, even though my pap-pap never drink, he also developed liver cancer and died from it. ***He also gives blood frequently and will come home from giving blood and drink just as much as he normally does, but get even drunker since he has just given blood- sometimes even driving on nights he does this.*** 

**8.) He encourages excessive drinking in my other brother:** 

My other brother that I haven't discussed thus far isn't as turned off by my dad's drinking, partially because he is in the air force and is rarely home. However, when he is home, my dad will encourage my brother to drink in excess with him on a nightly basis. This brother also drinks quite a bit, and I am terrified of him developing a drinking problem too, especially since my dad encourages it.

&#x200B;

**Overall, this has greatly impacted my mental health, but I have more concerns for my dad's health. After talking with my mother today, we decided to bring up our concerns with him.** We have tried in the past to mention to him how he shouldn't be drinking after giving blood, or maybe he shouldn't pour another drink but he gets defensive. These prior remarks were all made casually and in passing. 

**The plan my mom and I have is to suggest he give up alcohol for Lent- and from there sit down and discuss the concerns outlined above, emphasizing that this is all out of love and severe concern to bring it to his attention that he has a problem.** 

My mom does not think this will help, but as someone who is going to be a doctor someday, and as someone who cares about my dad, I can't sit around and do nothing. Even if nothing comes from this ""intervention""  I will feel better knowing I at least tried.

Realizing and acknowledging only now. Any advice on how to tackle it welcome.

This is a really long post, and I apologize for it. This is the first time I've ever written anything about my story and somehow I need to get it out.

I'm a 31 yo straight male. I'm in a relationship, but do not have a healthy relationship to sex, at all. I've masturbated compulsively for as long as I can remember. I did it as a kid. As a teen, I didn't have internet at home, but I would bring my laptop to school and download porn on Limewire to watch at home. In college my porn addiction really got out of hand (no pun intended). I lived with roommates and a speedy internet connection and would masturbate to porn at least twice a day. During midterms and finals, I could masturbate 4-5 or more times. I was a top student in high school (when my access to porn was limited), but I did poorly in college and eventually flunked out in 2013. My addiction to masturbation was a large part of this failure. I should have realized my addiction was ruining me already back then, but I didn't. This was nine years ago.

By the time I left college, I had had sex with exactly three women, exactly twice with each one - sounds weird but it's the truth. Real sex was a disaster - trouble holding an erection, finishing fast.

When I left college I managed to find an ok job despite having no completed degree. I also lived with a new and very sociable roommate whom I became great friends with, so between a new job and lots of socializing, there was less time for compulsive masturbation. I also had a four-month relationship with a beautiful and sexual woman. My troubles with real sex disappeared. When this relationship ended, I had a few more short-term relationships with girls. This period, which lasted a little over a year, was the best of my life.

In 2015, my relationship with the woman I am still with today began - let's call her Sara. We quickly began living together. I still had my job, but my social life all but disappeared with this new relationship. I was trying so hard to please Sara that I would turn down invitations from my closest friends. Eventually they all but stopped reaching out, and today I'll get invited to something from time to time, but I'm basically a loner.

My job also started going downhill as of 2015. Sara was still in college at this time, so she had a very different schedule from mine. I became exhausted of trying to be there for her every night until late, then rushing to work early in the morning. I would even miss at least one morning of work every week, for sex. During these early stages of our relationship, we did have sex quite a lot. Aside from my missing work, my sex life was fairly healthy. I pretty much only masturbated when she wasn't there, and I would be too tired for long porn sessions like I used to do.

I'm not sure exactly when things really took a bad turn concerning my sex life and sex addiction. It was fairly early in our relationship - sometime toward the end of 2016. Sex had pretty much disappeared from my relationship. I felt intense sexual frustration. Sara was writing her thesis during the day and was home, but many evenings she worked in a restaurant. So I started masturbating to porn pretty heavily again, because I no longer would try to ""save myself"" for her - I knew we wouldn't be having sex.

I also took the first step toward my now very problematic relation to sex: I joined a camgirl site, and started spending money on camgirls. Needless to say, this was the start of the spiral. At this time the ""Personals"" section still existed on Craigslist, and I started fantasizing about the escorts listed there. And masturbating compulsively every evening Sara wasn't there. In December 2016, I made that leap. One night I knew Sara was sleeping over with some friends, I went to a massage parlour for the first time. From the Craigslist listing, it looked like they offered a massage and a handjob for $100. Once I got inside, the masseuse took the lead, massaged my ass, flipped me over, and before I could say anything I was inside of her.

I felt pretty bad after this - at first. I had never been unfaithful, and I had kind of rationalized that a handjob was just a massage of another body part, so fine. I hadn't yet rationalized sex with the masseuse the same way. For a while I didn't go back, but obviously I eventually did. During 2017 it got to the point that every time Sara was away for a night - which wasn't that often, but still - I would go to the massage parlour. I felt a thrill walking to the place and ringing the doorbell, a thrill when the masseuse would start touching my ass, a thrill when she would tell me to flip over, a thrill when the sex started. Afterward though, I felt ashamed and disgusted with myself. I would rush home and shower and tell myself I wouldn't go back. I wouldn't for a while, but then porn would start to bore me, and suddenly I'd have a night to myself and I'd end up back at the massage parlour.

Twice I tried to stop completely. The first time was in 2018. I shut down my camgirl account, installed a porn blocker on my computer, and started tracking my ""sober"" days in a chart. For unrelated reasons, my relationship with Sara got better during this period, so I did manage to hold my resolution for a few months.

Porn made its way back first. Sara and I had moved into a place with a basement, and I set up my office there. Fairly quickly, this became a space where I would do little work, but where I would masturbate undisturbed all day. Then I set up my camgirl account again, and I even felt mad at myself for shutting it down because I lost the privileges of being a VIP member. Then I went back to the massage parlour. Then I took the next psychological leap: I went to an incall escort. The thrill was intense, and I went to see a few other escorts in 2019.

2019 resonates for me as the beginning of my depressive period. I lost my job - not entirely because of my addiction, but the fact that I was spending so much time masturbating and thus not meeting work objectives was a part of it. I tried to go back to college, and was refused. My relationship hit a rough patch, and sex, that had been more and more infrequent between us, pretty much disappeared. And in terms of friendships, I was now almost completely alone. With no degree, it proved impossible to find another job. Depression didn't help either - it's hard to sell yourself in a r√©sum√© when you are full of self-loathing. From the fall of 2019 until the beginning of the Covid pandemic, I spent my time masturbating with camgirls, and I visited escorts or massage parlours once a week while Sara was at work.

When the pandemic hit with the quarantine restrictions, things amazingly got slightly better for me. Suddenly I was allowed unemployment benefits, which lessened the growing financial stress. Sara and I started spending more quality time together and our relationship got better again. Not being allowed to see people made it easier to bear the fact that I had no one to see. And, of course, it was no longer possible for me to masturbate all day. I stopped seeing escorts as well. This is the second time I tried to put an end to my addiction. Exit camgirl sites, return of the no porn resolution. I moved my desk to a corner of the main floor of our apartment, so when I was at the computer, Sara's presence made it impossible to go for porn. I even tried seeing a psychologist toward the end of 2020. Unfortunately, I do not think this particular therapist was a great fit for me, and when unemployment benefits ended, I also put an end to my $120/hour therapy sessions.

This time my resolutions lasted even less time. Despite Sara and I developing a deeper friendship during quarantine, we still had basically no sex life. I grew very sexually frustrated, and I started watching porn again. I would do it when Sara was in the shower or at the grocery store, or even through my pants when she was literally in the next room. Some days I would slide a condom on to cum in without getting my pants soiled. I didn't go back to escorts for a while because of Covid, but I was back on camgirl sites.

In 2021, still jobless and with my credit card debt getting fairly daunting, I decided to start a small business. I got a studio space and started spending a lot of time there. Sara and I went from being together 24/7 to seeing each other only for evenings and nights. It took a toll on our relationship, but the first months of my business seemed promising. I was motivated; but I also now had a space where I was alone working for long periods of time. So although the work mitigated my urge to masturbate, I would do it at the end of every day.

In the fall, in part because of the nature of my business, things got slower. I started using this time to masturbate, often twice a day, often with camgirls for fairly long sessions. I went back to escorts, and the thrill was intense. It's worth noting the amount of time I now spend on my addiction. If I'm honest, since last October, I have been spending between four and six hours of every day masturbating to porn and camgirls, sending messages to escorts, and seeing escorts. I have spent thousands of dollars on camsites and escorts. Despite it being low season for my business, I could fairly easily have filled my order book if I'd chosen to spend these hours on my business.

And here I am. Acknowledging that I am addicted. Starting my search for ways to change. Absolutely no one knows about this, and I honestly do not have anyone in my life with whom I could share this.

This addiction has ruined the last decade for me. I failed at college. I failed at my job. I'm deep in debt. And I'm failing at my business.

The ease with which all this can be accessed makes it so difficult to quit. Not that I think any addiction is easy to quit. I think that is what makes an addiction, an addiction. The lure to go back to whatever gives you that thrill is just irresistable.

I don't have any other addictive tendencies. I don't do any drugs whatsoever. I'll have a beer with my girlfriend a few times a week. Even coffee, of which I have one cup most mornings, I can easily go without for days.

This is not the person I want to be, but I have completely lost control. Any advice on where to begin a recovery process is welcome.

I \[27F\] have had addiction problems since I was about 15 or 16 years old. Alcohol started becoming a problem for me by the time I was 17, and by the time I was 20 I was an alcoholic. My addiction stems from trauma and self-medicating for mental health problems. Alcohol was always one thing I could depend on to be consistent when my mind couldn't be. Deep down, I really felt like I needed it to be able to survive day by day. 

&#x200B;

It took me a long time to accept I had a problem. I didn't know how to gain the motivation to quit, and it didn't feel like the options available to me would work. AA never felt like something that would work for me and group therapy has always been very intimidating, and because those were the main treatments I was aware of, I felt like I had no alternatives. As time went on I kept praying for some kind of major event to stop me in my tracks and force me to want to change. Plenty of those opportunities came and went, but I only sank deeper into addiction. 

&#x200B;

The pandemic poured gas on the fire. I got to a point where I had gained about 80-90lbs mainly just from drinking. My health was bad. My fingers always trembled, I would get lightheaded really easily, I couldn't do the physical activities I enjoyed anymore, I was constantly throwing up and generally making myself sick, I even threw up blood on multiple occasions. My mental health was also bad. I had pretty much resigned myself to just let the alcohol slowly kill me, just like my uncle who passed of liver failure at age 40. Because my job has gone almost entirely remote since the onset of the pandemic, I never had to leave my apartment where I live alone. I went days without speaking to a human being except to buy booze. I rarely left my bed and did everything I could to avoid it. 

&#x200B;

It turns out that fear of further negative consequences was not, and probably was never going to be, what it took for me to quit. It was actually really simple: I had the courage to quit after I was finally given new hope for the first time in years. I decided it was time to try something new and went to see a new psychiatrist where I was given better medication options and greater insight into my mental health. I was also prescribed naltrexone as a way to combat my alcohol cravings. 

&#x200B;

At first I never had any intention of quitting fully. I just wanted to get my drinking riiight to the point where it ""technically wouldn't be unhealthy"" so I could still cling to my beer or two a day. I still didn't think I could feel okay with out it. But then I had a check up with my psychiatrist where something she said really stayed with me. She said ""Your drinking right now may not be physically unhealthy, but I'd still like to see you get to a place where you mostly only drink socially with friends."" I sat and digested that for a few days as I continued to drink as I normally would, but I wasn't sure why it was so stuck in my mind. I finally realized it was because I had never, and probably could never, drink simply recreationally. So I just decided not to go to the corner store that night, just to see what would happen and how I would feel. 

&#x200B;

It has been almost a month now and I haven't had a drop of alcohol since. In an extremely shocking turn of events, I don't even want to drink. I don't crave it at all (probably in large part thanks to the naltrexone). I feel better than I have felt in YEARS. For the first time since I can even remember, I actually have energy to do things. My apartment doesn't feel like this empty hole anymore, I'm taking care of it and my surroundings have new life. 

&#x200B;

I know it won't always be easy. Tere will be times I'll be tempted, there may be times I relapse and have to work my way back here. But until now, I never even knew this was possible for me to begin with. I didn't think I could do this or feel this way. I haven't gone this long without alcohol since I was maybe 22 or 23. Being sober is almost like a whole new kind of mind-altering experience, and it turns out I actually really like it. Muscles I haven't used in years are sore, not because I'm doing anything all that intense or different than my typical routine, but simply because I'm up and moving on a regular basis for the first time in years. 

&#x200B;

Yes I'm excited and wanted to share, but I also know there's so many people who feel the way I felt. It wasn't until very recently I even thought I could start to wean myself off of alcohol, let alone quit. I just want to encourage anyone who sees a little of themselves in my story that it CAN be possible for you. Even if you've let yourself down every time in the past. Even if you've been wrong every time you thought you were strong enough to try. Even if you think you need your vice to survive and you don't believe anyone when they tell you that you can do it. Even if all of that is true for you, you can still get clean. 

&#x200B;

Getting clean doesn't always mean you're sacrificing something or giving something up. My sobriety honestly feels like the greatest gift in the world, and I'm so protective of it because of how new and fragile it is. I have no desire to put myself in any situations where I'll be even remotely tempted. But, if I would have tried this three months ago, I guarantee you I would have slipped by now. Your time will come when you're ready too.

Overall, i really want to quit. For myself, my health, my friends, my family and now my great gf that brought out so many good things for me, and has helped me a lot on things. For me it is a healthy relationship, understanding and with the effort of two; it really feels like a team. I want to quit to help her prove that i can do it. I know that on my own sucks, and that with help of others is really better. Just wanted to let these thoughts out on my first post on Reddit. Any tips for people that have gone through vape addiction. Anything would help. Thanks.",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.7713620066642761}"

How long did it take after getting sober that you didn't have a raised level of depression and anxiety. I always have depression and anxiety but when I don't use it rebounds and becomes way worse. Also what substance were you using and for how long?

My story is that I have never been physically addicted to any substance.. therefore no acute withdrawal. But I have been self medicating my depression and anxiety for years. Started with weed for 12+ years. I quit weed. Then I fell in love with benzos (still love them but don't use often). My benzo use was always nightly binges of 1 to 2 mg for now longer than a couple weeks. Sometimes on a couple nights. Then I really slowed my benzo use and am now using Kratom almost daily. When I stop kratom (and therefore all drugs) my anxiety, depression, despair, etc., get so bad. Excruciating and almost intolerable. 

My question is, in your opinion how long do you think I need to stay off drugs to get my brain back to baseline (which isn't great to begin with). And lets say I go 3 months, then take a Xanax one night, will that whole PAWS cycle restart or will I be free and clear of the ""mental withdrawals?""",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9977230429649353}"

It started with alcohol until he was diagnosed with liver cancer when I was 9. At first he didn‚Äôt want to quit. But my mom convinced him to do it for me. Eventually he received a liver transplant. A new lease on life. And within a year he was abusing substances again. This time painkillers. Fentanyl, Oxycodone, etc.. Anything he could get his hands on he would use. He would get physically and verbally abusive towards my mother and older half brother(his stepson). And mentally and verbally towards me. He pretty much normalized his behavior around the house. Same routines and same cycle every month. But now his cancer is back. Finding that out shook me to my core. All I could think about was all the abuse he put that liver through. It pisses me off that someone had to die in order for him to live. And this is how chose to spend his second chance to live. Every bad moment from my childhood up until 2 or 3 years ago has been playing in my head on a nonstop loop for the last 4 months I‚Äôve known. Yesterday I was taking care of him while my mom was at work. All day he was begging for more pain pills. I gave him 2 at the time he was due for them but it wasn‚Äôt enough. He lied to me in order to switch his fentanyl patch that wasn‚Äôt due to be changed yet. And then 3 hours later he‚Äôs accusing me of not doing it at all. Then an hour later it changed to me not doing it right. Then the next hour it switched to me dropping it on the floor and he put it on himself. That was my breaking point. Because at the point i noticed he was using me to get his next high. And then I started realizing all the times he‚Äôs used me in the past. Now he‚Äôs in the hospital because I said fuck it. I called him an ambulance because I took almost 200 mg of some of the strongest painkillers known to man and he‚Äôs still bouncing off the wall complaining of pain. And since he‚Äôs in the hospital they checked on his liver. He more than likely doesn‚Äôt have much time left. And I don‚Äôt even care anymore. I told my mom if he somehow gets back to our house I will leave. Even if that means sleeping on the street. I refuse to keep letting him do this with me. But now I feel broken and have no idea what to do",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.998178243637085}"

In that time I did all available therapies private and state funded. They were very helpful but still - I was not able to quit. 
I intensified my efforts when I found out few months ago that meth permanently damages your cock. Haha. I don't mind meth killing me - but my dick?! - that's too much to bear lol. 
 
Meth is super vasoconstrictor - narrows your blood vessels, which over time helps plague to build in. Arteries plague, in medical terms, stays for good. Damage is pretty much permanent. 
 
It took me months of research but I found that the combination of Minocycline and Atorvastatin is very useful in giving up. 
This combination combats plague in arteries. 
It has to be minocycline - no other teracycline. 
It has to be atorvastatin - no other statin. And it has to be high dose 80mg (low dose won't work). 
There are few research documents on the net how this combination helps with meth addition. 
 
In the UK you can bullshit your way through to get this medicine online. For minocycline you have to say you have acne. For atorvastatin you say you have heart problems. If you brave enough you can face your GP and tell that you take crystal meth and that you need these medicine to combat Venosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels) but you will have permanent track of taking illegal drugs. I was not prepared to do that. You might not be successful first time online. I received my medicine after second attempt. 
 
Above all, the most important is your spiritual path to give up meth. If you think that taking two pills a day will stop you from taking meth you are stupid and there is no hope.
Spiritual path. Not religious! I found that vipassana meditation is best for me. It teaches you to observe your body. But it takes years to master it. 
Over the years I found that this meditation is my best ally in stopping meth. 
 
I have been taking minocycline and artovastatin for a month now and see positive changes but I did relapse after 6 weeks of sobriety :(
Hopefully you will have better results. 
Be happy. 
 
Don‚Äôt take pills if you are not serious about giving up because chances are you make it worse than it was before. 
Don't take antidepressants. They narrow you blood vessels which further deepens the problem. You might find it beneficial in the short term but deepening your problem in the long term will not make you happy.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9847514033317566}"
2022-02-23 10:58:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/szks4q/relapse_is_not_evil_it_is_an_opportunity_for/,"Relapse is Not Evil, It is an Opportunity for Progress","Hi all,

&#x200B;

I post this in r/StopGaming, but I thought I should share it here as well.

&#x200B;

I'm a work-in-progress who's been trying to completely quit gaming since 2021. I've seen a lot of posts here on Reddit about people relapsing. They share how completely defeated they feel, how they've hit the dead end of a road, and they quit on quitting simply to give in to their old addict behaviors. I wanted to share something that I realized today which hopefully can assist others' journeys for even the slightest bit. And since I'm still a work in progress myself, feel free to refute and share your constructive criticisms, so I can learn as well. 

&#x200B;

After countless quitting attempts and relapses, I completely quit gaming this January, but of course, relapse is always one step ahead of me. A few days ago, I saw someone streaming this one game on Youtube, which was really intriguing just to watch. I barely managed to stop myself from playing the game myself. However, I could not stop myself from watching the stream. I watched different streams and videos of people playing the game. I didn't sleep, skipped some meals, flipped a huge middle finger to my To-Do list, etc... Even though I wasn't playing the game myself,  all the symptoms resembled what I go through when I play a game. It was a relapse in a different form, but it had the same shitty feeling of self disgust and complete defeat... I bet a lot of you know what I'm talking about.

&#x200B;

However, this time was a little different. Three days after the 'relapse,' I finally came back to my senses and immediately reset my Youtube custom feed (so gaming recommendations would disappear). I still couldn't shake off that shitty feeling, but when I reflected back on my behaviors, I realized that I was really smooth at minimizing the damage and recovering from the relapse this time. In the past, my relapses took me weeks to regather myself and do all the damage controls, yet this time, only three days! That's when I realized that I have become better at picking myself back up.

&#x200B;

**Imagine quitting game as learning to ride a bike and relapsing as falling off the bike.** First time you fall off, it hurts like hell, it's embarrassing, you got a bike awkwardly stuck between your legs , and it takes a long time getting back up. After falling over a few times, your body intrinsically know when you are about to fall off, prepare yourself for the fall, and minimize the damage taken as you hit the ground. Your mind works the same way. You relapse, it damages your mentality, and you feel embarrassed. But after repetition, you kinda get used to it. When your mind recognizes that you are about to relapse, it subconsciously preps yourself for the fall. So, as you relapse, you don't get as deep into the game as you used to, and once you hit the ground, you are better and more efficient at cleaning yourself back up and start pedaling again.

&#x200B;

So, the next time you experience relapse, don't give up. Yes it hurts, and yes it sucks. You are freaking out and panicking, but first calm down. Change your mindset. **Relapse does not mean defeat or the end. It is a necessary part of the journey.** Take a step back and analyze the situation. Think about how you can minimize the damage and how efficiently you can recover from the fall. Do it a few times, and you will definitely see progress.

&#x200B;

I came to realize this after remembering about reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/g7mv9h/needadvice_dealing_with_apathy_and_complacency/foklj9m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) post a long time ago. There is a guy in the comment who talks about ""Habit Reframe Model."" I'm not sure if it's the exact same concept, but it definitely was applicable. If you are interested, give it a shot. It's a good, read and I learned a lot from it.

my girlfriend is aware i‚Äôm struggling and does what she can but just doesn‚Äôt understand. 
i just find i‚Äôm at the point now where i realise i‚Äôm so much happier without it. so much more present and productive. yet i still want it.

Recently i told her i wanted to stay off the bud but she wanted to pick up and obviously im not getting her stuff without getting my own.

I felt very annoyed at her for even suggesting we pick up when im trying to quit. She felt really bad about it but we still picked up because i felt like i should help her out because shes my girlfriend.

Im not blaming her for my weakness but how can i get sober when shes so into the addiction too with currently no intention to stop?

I created this app (free) in hopes to help as many people as possible in their journey to overcome addiction. I am looking for people that it may help, or if you know someone that it may help. It can be used for anything honestly. To track how many days you are able to not eat sugar for example. It can also be used for more serious things, like an alcohol or drug addiction, etc.

It's a very simple app. It is a constant timer that you reset if you relapse. When resetting, you enter a log on what caused/triggered the relapse. This is so that users can learn from past mistakes. There are different ranks that you achieve as your streak grows. There are also resources for helping to overcome addictions. I made this app with motivation and positivity in mind. It is themed and has the feel of a fantasy type of game/journey I guess you could say.

I am looking for people to test it out and give honest feedback.

It started out with getting Starbucks on my way to community college, then over the course of a year or two I had gotten used to having caffeine every day. I grew to enjoy everything from energy drinks, tea, black coffee, and caffeine pills. By the time I was 23, I knew I was addicted to caffeine and planned my days around it. I am now 25, and have successfully stopped using caffeine for a few months now with no cravings and solid energy levels, using a simple hack that popped into my head one day. 

One thing I did before using the hack was to simplify my caffeine intake. I went from having two energy drinks per day to drinking strictly black coffee. I did this because I wanted to disassociate my addiction with sugary drinks. I told myself that if I was going to keep consuming this drug then it had better be in the most bitter form possible. 

Now to the hack. I was at work pondering on my addiction, thinking about how caffeine makes you pee more than normal, when I wondered to myself what would happen if I drank a shit ton of water *before* starting my caffeine drink. It seemed like an easy experiment, so I tried it. After a few days of getting myself super hydrated BEFORE starting my caffeine, I realized that I didn't need to consume as much as normal. I found that if I drank my normal dose, I would be wigging out wishing I had had less. Over the course of a week I got myself down to drinking only 1 cup of plain black tea per day. Soon after that, I was able to go a day here and there without ANY caffeine, and sure enough I was able to stop completely. 

The key is to get yourself super hydrated before consuming your caffeine. The rule that I used for myself had to do with the color of my pee. I had to be peeing completely clear before starting my drink. Let me know if you try this and see any results. Good luck!",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9961856007575989}"

I'm 19. This is a confession of some sort, I guess. I‚Äôve got to tell someone.

I feel like I‚Äôve been an addict all my life. I never felt attached to people, especially kids my age, just to things that made me escape myself. I now feel like a hog with a degree in pure maths, if you see what I mean. A dangerous, big animal moved around by dopamine, seeking for endorphins with knowledge and intelligence he just should not have. I feel that's all I am.

The woman who gave me birth denied me many things as a baby: television, meat, sugar, cow milk, certain toys, and (long story short) my father. At the same time, she also breastfed me until 3 and a half years old (I still remember sucking on her). Guess what that did: all food became just a way to run away. Since the one my mother did give outside of her tits was books, all kinds of information (that is, brain food) too had become a way to run away, ever since learned how to read at 4.  Well, at 11, I found porn.

I still can‚Äôt fucking seem to get rid of the compulsion for that shit. I have seen about every kind of filth the human mind can produce just to get some novelty back in my perceptions. Every. I don‚Äôt care for stimulants at all, but I‚Äôm sure cocaine would be nothing compared to the rush a porn binge session gives me. And it‚Äôs not just my guess, I heard this from several people who did both. I spent 4, 5 hours, sometimes entire days watching porn and sexting with without ever hooking up, just for the rush, the excitement.

Add that I have been smoking pot every single day since the age of 14. I smoked straights (with those i‚Äôm a pack-a-day man), roll-ups, cigars, pipes, great weed, alright weed, badly kept weed, CBD flower cut with some kind of benzo sold as weed, amazing hash, hash cut with other vegetal resins of some kind, hash cut with petroleum derivatives‚Ä¶ at a point I started inhaling the cigars because I just couldn‚Äôt feel anything going down my lungs anymore (and soon I stopped feeling that as well, I stopped doing it for that reason alone).  I need it more than anything now. I don‚Äôt drink, nor watch porn or overeat, if I don‚Äôt have weed. The whole machine breaks down, I can‚Äôt do ANYTHING without knowing I‚Äôve got a joint for later. It‚Äôs like food and drugs switched places: I usually binge on food, fatty or sugary, once a day to feel some buzz, then completely forget to eat. At the same time I need substances like one would need meals.

Lately the bottle got me, too. It was ok as long as it got me drunk, I drank a beer and that was it. Then, I swear, something happened to my liver the moment I hit 18. From day to day, I couldn‚Äôt get drunk no matter what, I swear to god, I got to the point of throwing up without feeling inebriated, and still felt like lighting a cig afterwards. So I kept tring and trying and found out I really do have another kind of love for alcohol I couldn‚Äôt appreciate it before: it‚Äôs my favorite anxiolitic. I did do xans, tramadol, dihydrocodeine, and plugged straight medical morphine, yet nothing comes close to the warmth of booze for me. I have been drinking every day for the past months and can‚Äôt go more than a day without it. 4 alcohol units a day is the bare minimum, but have gone up to as much as 25 and still felt functional, not intoxicated.

The dramatic thing is, I have the lucidity to realize and understand all of this, I think about quitting every day, in fact, it‚Äôs mostly all I think about nowadays. I gave up this school year, see less and less my friends, don‚Äôt read, don‚Äôt watch movies, don‚Äôt play my bass anymore (I‚Äôve been playing for years and thought I loved it more than anything else), don‚Äôt write, don‚Äôt draw, I can only think about feeling numbed. I can‚Äôt fucking stop any of these things... I despise them, yet just can‚Äôt imagine myself without ‚Äòem, yet say to myself that every time will be the last, and from tomorrow on i will quit. But I really can neither stop, even for a day, nor stop trying to stop, enjoying my drugs for what they are and going on with my day. It‚Äôs eating me up in every way. I did LSD 4 times, and it pretty much did nothing to shake me out of this, I had fun for 12 hours and it all came back the way it as before. Pretty cool, but it made me want to anesthetize myself even more. It all feels like a long-term suicide and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll never be able to reverse it. The thing is, I just want to feel peace, after all. I can‚Äôt ever shake myself out of that mindset, and that was and will always be what dooms me.",0,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9983072280883789}"

Alabama is truly a fucked state in some areas and its starting to feel like nobody is sober. its like barely anyone here acknowaledges drugs are bad except the stupid fuckin cops and they do it in a bad way lmao i can count on both hands how many people ive met that havent tried drugs more then once and one of them is my old school ass 80 year old aunt whos prolly gonna outlive my dumbass haha lmao i stg she is gonna live forever , but i have seen pregnant people shoot up ive speed balled with a friend who was pregnant , its sad hearing ur best friend  you grew up with since u was 6 say they know their kid is gonna be mentally fucked from drugs and they dont care, kids shoot up, parents shoot up their kids, ive never done it, i actually mean it when i say im afraid of needles lmao its not like their kids where 7 or sum shit but ive seen parents shoot up what they call the love of their life, still shooting your child up like its normal when theyre in their like teenage years or 20's is fucking sad. i have Od'd a handful of times way too fuckin many to count at this point, people are suprised im alive and im lowkey lucky im not brain dead my wheeze hasent gone away since i chemically burned my lungs from meth, im only turning 18 this year and i feel like an old man, i have arthirits bruh. Life is truly fucked up tho when your parents only care about drugs, some people out there can relate some people have it so much worse then me im lucky lol, but u truly just dont know until you have ur own mom light a meth pipe for you or rail u up a line or starts crying when seeing u because you look dead and have been awake for 2 weeks because of her lowkey, or helps u lie about ur drug habit, some parents parent their kids to be drug adddicts so they can carry it on. drugs suck and it makes me sad people dont realize what theyre getting [into.](https://into.My) my best advice to literally everyone and anyone with the slightest talent or chance even if u get raped tortured or abused please , never do drugs it will take everything from u make ur problems extend like a family tree and youll forget why u even started. It starts u over rewires and fucks u 100 times harder then u ever imagined was possible.  it will make you, break you,and shape u however the drug wants, and fuck u harder then any abuse it actually will ruin you worse then ptsd  trust me when i say it will take u beyond there lmao, it made my problems 100x worse then they where and i cant figure out how to feel emotions normally again lmao every drug catches up one day and at this pointi have no reason to do them, its the opposite actually, i cough up black grey brown red yellow  bloof green white pink orange, bro ive coughed up bronchial tubes and im only just now becoming an adult. I have the beggining stages of  COPD  i cant get rid of a sinutitis or bronchitis ive had it for over 1 and a half years if i dont get rid of it im gonna have chronic bronchitis, not to mention lung absecceses and lug failure, lung cancer and lung illnesses are the only thing besides  everycancer and demtnia that truly run deep in my fam,and  almost every health problem  i have actually stems from fucking drugs . i had alcohol poisoning so many times and frenquently as a actual kid, i literally think its the cause of my MS,  fatty liver, kidney problems and the reason im 17 with ED. Well if u cant tell im all over the place, i relapsed today i got a gram of fuckin dope from some random weed plug i tried out. just shows u how easy a kid can get drugs , dealers dont give a fuck , ive been offered to shoot up from my family drug dealers could care less if u inhaled jenkum, if u really think ur plug cares and genuinely knows where their shit is coming from ur wrong as hell unless they literally make it or test it in front of u lmao ive watched a person get out, and weigh up and sell a 12 year old the right amount of heroin they was buying . some parents only care abt drugs so much that they get their kid addicted so theyre on their level or some kids are so unlucky to be born to people who straight up sell their them for meth lmao as fucked up as that actually is, im ashamed at how much it happens here. have u ever seen someone instantly decide to get an abortion becuase they know theyre kid would be retarded cuz they shot up meth the whole time pregnant? or seen a persons baby go from normal to permament brain damage or cognigtive problems because they didnt wanna quit drugs? u think its really a kids fault they cant focus and have problems? my lil brother has OCD ADHD and severe anxiety that i genuinley think is worse then mine becuase hes the only one my mom did dope while preganant with. It gets worse tho, here in alabama especially idk abt anywhere else, some familys brains are literally so far gone they find it okay to molest and rape their children, okay if that doesnt show people how fucked up drugs are idk what will. Drugs can and will make u a bad person over time, theyre chemically designed to take your morals away  uppers will do it for sure and almost instantly lol if any of yall have been deep in meth u know its true, most people never come back and permantly lose themselves. IVE LITERALLY SEEN IT HAPPEN AND HAVENT QUIT TRIPPIN SINCE I DID METH, its either the dope nowadays genuinly causes brain damage, or i have permamant Hypochondria or paranoid personality from benadryl and dope, u know its bad when u piss the bed because your so scared of getting caught high and actually think your fams posioning u or brainwasshing u lol well anyways i hope this scares u fuckers away from drugs, i wish people couldve actually made me listen. i really dont know how long ima be alive so i hope my story hits close with some, aye and if ur going thru what i am tho there is a couple things that make it better besides differnt drugs, genuine love, a hobby and fake it til u fucking make it homie, ive learned go with the flow take the days easy and pretend like nothings wrong haha, it lowkey helps. i hope my story makes sense , or helps somebody out there. I think im too far gone for saving so i really hope i can save someone out there before u get this far, its always been my dream to help a shit load of people before i die so ye i hope my sob story helped, i know it sure as hell devolped one character, me lmao drugs are bad , mkay?",29,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9985048770904541}"

After I got a good buzz going I'd take some oxy and klonopin, chase down with more beer. Right before it was time to work do a couple lines of coke then pop my happy ass into work. That was my daily schedule for almost a year, up until last year I decided to quit, because I got an amazing girlfriend, who I saw myself spending the rest of my life with. We started living together, things were going good, then 8 months in she started talking to and flirting with another guy, doing who knows what else behind my back, saying I changed, and I'm not the same person I was when we started dating. Now I'm having a really shitty crisis where I'm feeling like the drugs made me who I was, made me into somebody who people liked, and I'm having serious thoughts of going back. I don't want to go back but life feels so empty now and I just want to feel normal again. I just wanted to get that out there into the open world of the internet.

Right before 8:30 am when bf comes back home and landlord usually gets in his office, smell's completely gone. This has been going on for several months now. Told landlord, he came up here in the morning, and told me no smell of any sort, it could be food. I've been trying very hard to see who those people are, but it's pointless. No talking whatsoever, not a peep. I stand by the door sometimes for an hour just to see who they're and where they come from, the minute I step into my bathroom, I hear them running while I am in there.

I've asked two old ladies near me, and they told we didn't smell anything. 

Smell is not like marijuana for sure. Like burning wood when you're out camping or something like that. Could be crack? My bf did smell it once out in the hallway and told me it's not weed. 

We moved to this city from a 8 hour away town, and spent lots of money, and it's just insane to move somewhere else now. Also, bf works pretty close to here and I work from home.

If you have children, shouldn't they be enough to get clean?","Hi. What started with alcohol, has been a decade of one substance after the other. I need this for energy, or I need this for depression. My kids have seen me measure my kratom and phenibut for years and I always said it was for energy or a supplement for my protein shakes. Oooooooookay.

On substances im not an introvert anymore, im not shy and insecure and anxious. Im outgoing and talkative and creative. All of these things that make me an even better mother (I tell myself) because I've never been clean longer than a couple weeks off of EVERYTHING for 8 years to even know.

I remember my creativity when my kids were 1,2,3... 

I know I don't need drugs to be that person. But I can never make it through withdrawal/ paws and be a good enough mother, so I go back or I find another ""legal"" drug. (No I have 0 help to go to treatment. None.) I've been ""sick"" SO MANY TIMES for a week or 2 on end when they've had to basically fend for themselves. That can't happen again. Ever.

This last habit cost me $20k. I panic about paying lunch money at their school but I can go pay $50 a pop for ""energy and motivation""?!?

As I popped my last handful of pills which I thought was discreet, my 8 year old in the backseat of the car coloring... ""mommy why are you taking so many pills? You don't need those mommy."" She's right.

I stopped drinking a 5th of vodka a day 5 or so years ago after I had to drink(unknowingly, or so I THOUGHT!) To be social at my kids sports game. Drove home trashed, they called the only person they knew hysterical trying to give them directions of where we were. Police came because I was in someone's front lawn - I fought them and three other people infront of my kids - woke up the next morning in my bed clueless.

I could have lost them all. Just like that. They all remember that. My 8 year old doesn't even like me to drink wine or beer, tells me I don't need it. She knows I act differently, even though in my mind I need it to get things done etc.

I could be such a better mother. 50 hour work weeks, 3 kids, school, sports, home - HOW do I convince myself I can be amazing without all of this shit thats probably killing me?! I tell myself everyday & I already know I dont need this shit and I need to stop for my kids - but its like I HAVE to always be on SOMETHING?!

Hi everyone!

My name is Stephanie and I'm a UCSD student majoring in urban studies and planning. With so many loved ones in my life that have struggled with substance abuse, it is a topic that is very special to me and that I want to be a part of helping. I am most interested in learning what urban planners can do to help those living with addiction with this current research project focusing on housing and one's journey of recovery. I am looking for individuals willing to share their own personal experiences by answering some or all of the questions listed below. Thanks in advance to those willing to help!

Some questions may have overlap, so feel free to skip any questions that you already answered in another question or that you are not comfortable answering. Write as much or little as you are comfortable sharing. I may pull quotes from the responses so feel free to write your first name otherwise it can be completely anonymous (ex: ""Interviewee A"").

You can answer each question individually or write one long response that touches on some of the questions below on housing/recovery. Thanks Again!

**Here are the questions:**

Name (optional):

Number of sobriety days, months, or years (optional):

1. Tell me about your housing history? You may go as far back as you like. For context, please mention the cities and states have you lived in along with any information that relates to substance abuse/recovery or just general feelings about where you lived. If you have lived in rehab or sober living housing please share this experience.
2. How do you feel your housing impacts your sobriety? (negatively or positively)
3. Can you think of a time you experienced challenges in obtaining stable housing? For example, have you ever experienced homelessness? (housing instability includes times you have lived on couches of friends/family as well as living out of a vehicle)
4. Does anyone in your household also live with addiction?
5. Does anyone in your family live with addiction?
6. What types of services do you rely on for your recovery that are offered in your city? (ex: meetings, clinics, therapy, etc.) and do you feel these services are accessible to you based on where you are currently living? How about where you lived in the past?
7. Is there anything (besides housing) that planners should know that would help the substance abuse crises (For example, anything involving transportation, policy, zoning of methadone clinics, supportive services, or education)?

I have been a weekend addict for 10 years and a daily pot addict. I‚Äôm mostly hooked to alcohol, speed or cocaine and binge smoking over the weekend. The weekdays then pass by with me super exhausted, unable to manage my life yet being highly functional. I think I was an addict way before these 10 years though. My primary attachment figure, for example, was often my computer when I was young due to emotional neglect. 

My husband is as much an addict as me, but less of a weekend addict and more of a heavy pot smoker. It is safe to say though that I don‚Äôt have many sober people around me. A lot of friends are addicts themselves. I live in a big metropolitan city and this is mostly the norm (I have sober friends too). 

My moms side of the family are heavy addicts and my mother herself died at 40 because of her habits that sort of accumulated over time. 

I have been suffering from CPTSD, grief and immigration stress like forever. I‚Äôm tired of me hurting my body till I can‚Äôt hurt it anymore over the weekends, and really really want to come clean. I know I need to work on my trauma but I have finally realised that I cannot work on my trauma while being addicted. 

I believe I need to stop pot smoking, alcohol and stimulants all at the same time. I‚Äôm just afraid that will relapse because it is always around me (since my husband is an addict himself). I don‚Äôt want to focus on him and try to make him stop when he is not ready, as this will make me codependent and will not help me take responsibility for my own actions.

I am looking for a therapist (this might take a while) but not sure if I am ready for group meetings yet as I have never done that and I might have some anxiety surrounding it. I am also not religious. I just really need advice from recovering addicts or former addicts. How should I go about my recovery? What were your experiences?

Honestly,I'm not over weight ,I do have extra 5kgs than I should but I have always faced body dysmorphia. 
I used to get high,eat a hell lot and then feel guilty about it so I used to puke it out.
My weight issues have been with me since I was a teen and I'm really trying to get off it.


5 days back,I flushed out the weed I had.
My partner and I decided to do that together.


I have been feeling really depressed since then.
I have this really bad dips where I just want to cry and find myself to be a loser.
I feel anxious and stressed when I think about my career and I do find myself wanting to smoke up a J but I am stopping myself.

I also feel really disconnected with my body.
I feel like I'm watching a movie.
It's exactly the way I used to feel when I was high.
I have felt several times when I was high that this is the level of consciousness and awareness I want all the time and not the level of consciousness I have when I'm sober.


I don't know what's going on. But I'm really low and I don't have the energy. I'm trying to research and which is why I ended up writing this all down here.
Please help me with any advice possible.

However, some treatment programs insist that if based on such principles.

Our training teaches us to consider a broad array of options such as harm reduction, alternative peer support groups like Recovery Dharma, etc. We definitely encourage people to attend some type of outside group simply for the connection but even that isn't a mandate; every individual js different and will have different needs. I'm a therapist as  part of a very flexible IOP program with emphasis on harm reduction and motivat8onal interviewing so I feel lucky.

2022-02-19 17:10:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/swla2n/my_journey_to_benzofree_life_after_7_years_on/,My journey to benzo-free life after 7 years on Clonazepam!,"Hey everyone, after 7 long years I am successfully 100% benzo free! It has been a long and often difficulty journey - now that I am on the other side, I feel amazing and wish I had been brave enough to remove the benzo-handcuffs years ago. This post is encourage you all to stick with it through the hard times and push to get to zero - the negative side effects will end and you will get your life back!

Note: This post is me sharing my personal journey and not to be taken as medical advice - I am not a doctor, just a regular person.

Seven years ago I was prescribed .5mg Clonazepam by my doctor for anxiety. At first it worked great and then I decided I was feeling good and ready to ‚Äústop‚Äù taking it after a month. The withdrawal effects were brutal - elevated heart rate, insomnia, nightmares, sweats, jolts to the body and muscles, spasms, mental fogginess and general discomfort.

Days turned into weeks and months turned into years of taking Clonazepam as I was unsure how to confront the nasty side effects of withdrawal. Quite frankly, it was ‚Äúeasier‚Äù for me to keep taking it than to confront the difficult challenge of stopping.

Around 1 year ago I came across the **Ashton Manual** ([https://benzo.org.uk/manual/](https://benzo.org.uk/manual/)) which is absolutely critical for you to read every single word. The manual is a guide for how to taper off as well as what to expect along the way. I decided to do a slow taper to lessen the effect of withdrawal. Every 2 weeks, I lessened my dosage by around 10% in slow increments. The taper process was hard, I had withdrawal symptoms from small step downs and even had setbacks where I had to stay at the same level or increase to combat benzo sickness. My first goal was to taper off during the course of one year.

After testing a slow taper for nearly a year, I decided it was time to get off entirely. My doctor reduced my dosage to 0.25 mg and eventually 0.125 mg Clonazepam (which is the lowest amount prescribed to my knowledge). Towards the end, it was so hard to break down the pill to follow the taper schedule so I bought a small weighted scale on Amazon for $20 to ensure I was being accurate when breaking down the pill. Some people may say this is a very small amount and shouldnt cause and withdrawal symptoms but they are wrong - I am very sensitive to benzos and the withdrawal symptoms are intense even at low levels after a long period of use.

To my understanding, withdrawal intensity correlates to two factors 1) dosage amount and 2) length of use. While my dosage amount was small, my length of use was long and my body had become dependent on benzos to function.

After reading the Ashton Manual, I decided to improve my lifestyle for the final taper process - cutting out alcohol, reducing caffeine (small amount of coffee early in the day is okay but not at night), eating healthy, exercise and reducing stress in my life.

The final taper is the hardest and the withdrawal symptoms are the most sever. I went with 25% reductions every two weeks for the final 8 weeks off a very small base amount. I think the key here is never to make drastic changes, everything needs to be done slowly over time as your body regains the basic functions around the nervous system that it had outsourced to benzos.

I read somewhere that the half-life of Clonazepam is quite long and therefore it can remain in your system for around 3 weeks +/- after the final dosage. I made it my final goal to quit 100% and make it to the three week mark to see how my body feels off of Benzos.

After finally taking my last dose, the withdrawal symptoms kicked in:

**Week 1** \- The symptoms hit hardest starting Day 2 through Day 7 including insomnia, racing heart, muscle jolts and spasms, nightmares, brain zaps during sleep, sweats, dizziness, mental fogginess and emotional irritability.

**Week 2** \- Definite improvements from Week 1 but still not feeling great. Racing heart, nightmares, mental fogginess, spaciness and some dizziness and irritability.

**Week 3** \- Slight mental fogginess (better each day), bouts of anxiety under stressful situations, spaciness.

**Week 4** \- MADE IT!! Benzos have left my system and it was a real morale boost to cross the three week threshold. Honestly, I am feeling wonderful and nearly 100%. Still some anxiety feelings and mental fogginess occasionally but I would prefer that any day over benzos. I am sleeping better than I have in years. I sleep well 6 out of 7 days per week.

I also know that my symptoms will only improve over time. After many years of benzo use, it takes months and maybe even a year+ for the body to regain functions that were dormant as you were taking the pill.

Advice:

* Withdrawal symptoms are normal and part of the recovery process. Please read the **Ashton Manual** ([https://benzo.org.uk/manual/](https://benzo.org.uk/manual/)) as a guide so you understand how to listen to your body and what it means. It is long but you need to read every word - its worth taking back control of your life. If you have severe symptoms, contact a doctor or emergency room immdiately.
* A slow taper process over many months is critical, you should never try to stop taking a high dosage and going straight to zero, this is not a recipe for success.
* Improve your lifestyle and focus on staying healthy and off other drugs and substances that might disrupt your taper process.
* Stay focused and set a goal - for me the first goal was to taper off over one year and then it was 3 weeks off of benzos.

Conclusion, I am at week 4 off of benzos and never looking back. This forum was an incredible source of information and inspiration along the way. Yes, there are good days and bad days but I would encourage you to stick with the Ashton Manual process and know that there is absolutely a light on the other side and it does get better!",36,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9903650879859924}"

For a long time, nearly I'd say 7 or so years I've suffered on and off with drug use, ultimately getting to the worst point around 2017 where I blew a lot of money over the period of ten weeks. It cost me pretty much everything I had, and I managed to get myself clean. Up until around mid 2021 I didn't work, so I decided to find myself employment and ended up going to a job where most of the workforce used some sort of drug, whether it be coke or weed.

I used to think I'd be strong enough to resist the urges or temptation more so, but I ended up going back down the hole.

I'm at a point where my girlfriend is trying to get a job to work in the country I live, she's from Europe and myself the UK, she doesn't know about any of my drug use, and I feel as if I tell her she won't want to carry on our 2 year relationship.

I've left the job I was working at and sold my car, but the feelings of guilt and low self esteem have come back stronger than I've ever experienced, I currently don't want to do anything, sometimes feeling like I don't want to be here.

I feel stupid asking for help here but I genuinely have nowhere else to go. 
My best friend (18) has in the past year started doing a great deal of drugs. It started off with weed, but now they‚Äôre taking oxy. They have a lot of trauma and mental health issues, which no one but me has been properly informed about. They very often threaten to kill themselves and generally just talk about suicide a lot. We go to boarding school together, and I‚Äôve been supporting them through all this since the drug problem thing started. Due to a lot of home/parental issues, they don‚Äôt believe themselves to be as ill as they are, which has made it very hard to convince them to get help. For half a year now I‚Äôve been trying to get them to go to a psych ward, and two weeks ago, after a horrible episode, they finally agreed (only because I told them to). They were there for a week, prescribed antidepressants, discharged. They did not tell the staff the whole story, left out the drug abuse. They‚Äôre too scared of the repercussions it may have now that they‚Äôre 18. Now that they‚Äôre back home for the holidays, they‚Äôre doing much higher dosages of oxy. I am the only one who knows, and I am not even there to help them if anything happens. I thought the psych ward would help, but it seems to have just completely diminished any chance of them wanting help. I haven‚Äôt slept for days, thinking they may be dead. I‚Äôm only 16, and I don‚Äôt know what else I can do. I talk to them constantly, and they have told me I‚Äôm the only reason they‚Äôre still alive. I love them to death, and am far too scared to tell anyone because they would kill themselves if I did. I just feel so lost and have no idea how to help them out of this. Would be appreciative of any advice or help :/

when my friend died, i crawled into the liquor bottle and clung to it HARD. i would drink a bottle and a half of vodka every day. i would vomit in my sleep and didnt have the mental fortitude to clean up, so i would sleep in my own vomit for hours. it thought THAT was rock bottom. i was wrong. a very concerned professor of mine made me an appointment with a psychiatrist and made me promise her to go there. the psychiatrist said i immediately needed inpatient care, and soon after i was admitted to a psychiatric ward to detox from the alcohol. they gave me diazepam, despite my protests, since i already had a seizure. during withdrawals, i had my first major psychotic episode. i became incredibly paranoid, thought i was possessed, thought that i had personally killed my friend, thought i was responsible for another friends suicide, thought doctors could read and interfere with my thoughts, and i was hearing many nasty voices, always there, always commenting on everything i do. i was put on antipsychotics. 

as soon as i get out of the psych ward, after a 2 month state, i start binging drugs like there is no tomorrow. i started with doing speed at parties, and it all spiraled when i discovered the world of RCs. i have binged every single RC i could get my hands on. stims, dissos, psychedelics, opioids, all of them. my mental health saw a sharp decline and i reached a point where i really didnt care anymore if i was alive or if i was dead. the highs were high and the lows were devastating. this all culminated to one day, without any significant opiate tolerance, i took 70mg morphine, 30mg oxycodone, took 7mg xanax to chase it down, and had a few drinks. naturally i stopped breathing and i turned blue in the lips and on the hands. some acquaintances found me unconscious at the front door of my apartment building and an ambulance was called. my life was saved. 

when i was discharged i went on the biggest binge i have ever done in my life. i didnt sleep for a week. then i decided to do LSD, which was a terrible, terrible, terrible idea. after a trip from hell, it finally dawned on me. i have hit rock bottom. if i dont get clean NOW, i will die. i checked myself in the psych ward again, and that initial drug test came positive foe EVERYTHING they were checking for. i stayed for another two months, and this time i absolutely dedicated myself to getting clean. it had to work on myself, and i had to learn how to get my schizophrenia under control. 

i made what my friends describe as a miraculous recovery. i moved back to my home country to stay with my family. i got psychiatric help and was put on medication that actually helps me function. i havent had many psychotic symptoms since. a year and a half later, i am enrolled in school and doing well, i have lots of friends and lots of hobbies, i am getting disability benefits to support myself, and i have learned many healthy ways to cope with my illness, without being destructive. 

the fear of relapse looms over me every day, like a dark cloud. i keep thinking to myself, maybe you can do drugs responsibly this time, maybe you can do them just once. i do get cravings. but i know that i cant. once i start again, everything that i strived so hard to accomplish will go down the drain. if i relapse, it will be my new rock bottom. by participating in the drugs related subreddits and sharing my experiences and knowledge with other people, i have found a way to live the drug life vicariously, through others, without wanting to go back myself. 


i wrote all this text because i wanted to share my story with you guys, but also as a message of hope. it gets better. it may not seem like it, but really, really, it does get better. you have to fight really hard for it, but it gets better. i never could imagine that i could live a healthy life ever again, but here i am disproving that, every day. there is always hope, never lose it. you can do it and it gets better.

The second it's 10:00 am and the doors open, they'll literally storm in like without it they're gonna die damn brah really? It's actually quite sad to see and feel bad for family to deal with that. 

I fully understand and knowledge the user is going to matter more than the substance, but with average odds, which one is more likely to have it worse for forming addiction, and dependency statistically, x of out 100 people get addicted to either?

We need your stories!,"Posting here because I feel like the lockdowns adversely affected the recovery community - the lockdown took the life of more than one of my friends.

Hello!

We are a pair of artists creating an immersive art installation about how the COVID lockdown and mandates have affected our collective lives, as well as how the government response to the pandemic has largely ignored the societal issues their regulations have created.  This installation will involve several rooms for the viewer to explore, one of which would be full of portraits of our peers who have been negatively impacted by the actions of the COVID response.

This room would have multiple portraits in various mediums, along with a short story of how the lockdown has affected their life.  These stories will be published with your first name only, or anonymously if you so choose, and we‚Äôd love to get some peer submissions so we can render portraits and publish your story.  

This would be a traveling art experience, hopefully coming to all the major cities.  Whether or not you choose to participate, we‚Äôd love to see you come and experience what we‚Äôve created.

We don‚Äôt yet have a timeline for opening, but are hoping to have this finished by this summer and ready for viewing.  If you would like to participate, please fill out the following form, including a photo of yourself you‚Äôd like turned into a portrait! Of course, if you decide to submit, you will receive a copy of the portrait we create.

Please note, depending on the volume of responses, we may not be able to use *all* of the submissions.  We plan to use as many as we can!

hi this is my first reddit post but i wrote a poem about how i was feeling yesterday on a day when it was very hard to stay away from the drugs and i thought maybe i‚Äôll share the poem. 

pain is something i know all too well
it is the one thing that is always there
in the darkness of my own soul
i have nothing but myself and the pain
and the escape i found from the pain 
the moments of euphoria when i could escape 
i‚Äôd kill for that feeling to come again 
yet that euphoria could kill me too
when you‚Äôre in pain you take pain medicine 
so i swallowed pill after pill
trying to make the pain stop
for that moment of euphoria 
for the numbness from the pain
anything to escape my problems
all i ever wanted was to feel good
and the drugs gave me that feeling
yet they brought me to death‚Äôs door
and when i woke up i knew i had to stop
i‚Äôm not scared of dying 
everyone has to die someday 
but i‚Äôm not ready yet
so i drag on
i stopped taking the pills
i stopped so why do i feel this way 
the pain has returned and it‚Äôs stronger now
and this time i don‚Äôt know who i am 
who have i become?
i always had goals
so nobody could ever tell
they never knew how far gone i was
it‚Äôs so hard to talk about it now
yet so freeing in some ways
i thought sobriety would make it easier
but life only seems harder
i don‚Äôt want to relapse 
i tried too hard to get here
33 days today
yet the drugs are all i think about
how easy it would be to say
just one more time
but one more time is never just one more time
one more time will be my downfall
they say 40 to 60 percent of addicts relapse
can i beat the statistics?
do i have any chance? 
or is there no point?
do i let the drugs control me?
because i sure as hell don‚Äôt control them. 
am i a catastrophe waiting to happen?

I have no idea how or why I became addicted. There is no obvious explanation for it. But I did and eventually that became too destructive so I found a new escape in gambling. One that I could hide from the world, and didn't risk me landing in jail or hurting someone during a blackout. I have a serious Jekyll and Hyde complex, and its scary enough that I want nothing to do with alcohol.

I've tried for years to find reprieve and have never found success. AA, GA, Counseling have been of no use. So instead I try to control it, and minimize the damage it causes. I put up barriers to prevent me from wasting our money. I send my wife my pay check (or try to, it doesn't always get there),  I've intentionally tanked my credit so I can't borrow. I've disabled cash advances on my card and banned myself wherever possible from the casinos. And for the most part this stuff has allowed me to be a functional addict. I leave just room to get a taste of that escape I crave so much.

The thing is I'm miserable as all hell when I'm not gambling. I'm just surviving life until my next paycheck and my next hit. The worst part is that there is no guarantee that the ""hit"" is coming any time soon. The thing with gambling is the hit only comes when you win, and the system is designed to make you lose. So after waiting 14 days for my next paycheck and losing all the money I set aside for my addiction in 15 mins, my brain just begins to unravel. When I'm in this place I can't tolerate the world. I can't tolerate my job. I can't tolerate every single person in this world because for the most part they just get in the way of me doing what I want. Most regrettably I can't tolerate my wife and son (whom I love more than anything). I still find joy in doing things with them, but the daily grind of work, chores, sleep, work, chores, sleep wears me out so much that I just want to space out and then I resent them for ""forcing"" me to participate in life.

If this goes on for long enough, I eventually turn to the one thing that is guaranteed to give me temporary relief....the bottle. In one night I can cause so much damage that it takes years to repair and I've come dangerously close to making mistakes that can't be undone.

My wife is on the verge of leaving me. Between all the wasted money, the constant mood swings, or the fear of me coming home drunk, she is simply at her limit. And now we have a three year old son she needs to protect from me.  My biggest fear before having a child was that they might inherit this from me. The reality is that I am actively guiding him down that path with my behavior but I just can't stop. I'm broken and there doesn't seem to be a fix.

I've had suicidal thoughts for years. I don't know that I was close to acting on them but they scared the hell out of me. They went away completely when my son was born. He gave me a sense of purpose and strength that I didn't know existed. I WANT to be there with him for whatever life throws his way but now I'm beginning to wonder if he would be better off without me. These thoughts are starting to creep back in my head and I'm terrified that they will get worse.

I feel better after writing this though. I've bottled it up inside for so long or maybe it's because I've only said these things before to people who just can't possibly understand.  I never shared this at meetings because I didn't want to ""be a downer"" in rooms that were largely full of people re-affirming how much better their lives were in sobriety.

My friends and I started doing drugs casually 8 years ago. You know how it goes, we started off smoking a little weed, having a good, innocent time. At the time, we would often preach about not doing anything stronger, that weed was enough yada yada yada. 

Though, as time went by, we evolved from mere stoners, into ""Jacks of all Trades"". LSD, MDMA, Shrooms, 2CB, Cocaine, Ketamine, Percs, and various kinds of ADHD medication, and once in a blue moon a little anti-anxiety. Even though we eventually ended up forsaking the mantra of never doing anything stronger, we still strived to treat the drugs and the frequency with respect and care. And I must admit, most of the boys are doing quite well for themselves with career, relationships, etc. We are by no stretch of our imagination doing perfect, but we can look ourselves in the mirrors (unless we're coming down from MDMA lol)

One of the boys was always the one enjoying and consuming drugs slightly more often and with a little less care, through the years.  He abused MDMA at an early age and developed Serotonin Syndrome in the space of 1 year, where he really burned his fingers. After that, he would slow down a little and primarily do downers and psychs, and we thought he had learned his lesson.

Fast-forward to the summer of 2021.  
My friend attended the local University and was finishing his bachelor's degree, and everything seemed to be going OK. He had passed all his exams, except 1, in which he had to attend a re-examination at the beginning of the upcoming school year.  So my friend was enjoying himself through the summer and celebrating a little prematurely since he was basically done. I don't blame him, and I certainly did my fair share of drugs thru the summer, as well. He started experimenting with PCP and a lot of designer drugs thru the darkweb, and it was all fun and games until he eventually received some bad news. His study group contacted him, and basically communicated ""We don't want to be in a study group with you, you aren't responsible, find somebody else."" This news broke my guy, and he ended up totally spiraling out of control, especially with PCP and opiates. 

He never managed to attend the final exam. He now spends all of his money on drugs.  
Lends money from his parents to buy drugs. Only sleeps every second day.   
Only eats a couple of times a week, and it's always cardboard pizzas.   
Thrashes his apartment once in a while, when he gets angry. Goes to the hospital once in a while, we aren't even surprised anymore. When he's sober, he's just laying in bed in fetal position, he's obviously depressed. Yesterday, a fellow friend told me he started boofing heroin. The icing on the cake (or lack thereof) he fucking tried making a move on my girl man, behind my back, and he considers me one of his best friends, you know, one of the boys. 

I've talked with him since, and even tho he was extremely embarrassed and regretful, it seems like all the worry, advice, and comfort we pour into him, goes in one ear and goes out the other. Nothing seems to stick.

In the space of 8 months, I've seen one of my friends fully transforming into a full-blown addict/junkie.

So, my question is: What can I do? How do I help my friend? Can I help my friend? Should I tell authorities/family?

I haven't forgiven him for making a move on my girl, but I don't wanna see him like this, it's going to kill him.

Every answer is appreciated.

Help me help him.

I started using Tramadol about 2 years ago and it dramatically improved my mood, my work, etc. I've dealt with depression and anxiety (including a panic disorder) for about 15 years. Once I started using Tramadol, I felt legitimately happy for the first time in my life. I was killing it at work, exercising daily, had a great sex life and relationships, etc.

Then my online connect went away. I started snorting heroin to avoid withdrawals. The last time I used was January 29th, but I was weaning and really trying to get clean since the end of November. Since then, I've been completely useless. I lost my job. I used to play music (my banjo) every day and now I barely touch it. I have no sex drive and it's difficult for me to even become aroused.

I've never felt so fucking hopeless. I am constantly thinking about suicide. I've tried several antidepressants to no avail. The last antidepressant I was taking, Wellbutrin, led to a grand mal seizure 2 weeks ago and I spent 4 days (including my birthday) in the hospital.

I've been forcing myself to exercise for the past couple days in hopes that it will help me heal. I just don't know what to do or how to cope right now. I guess I'd just like to hear from some people who came out the other side of opioid addiction.

I'm no stranger to addiction. I was addicted to benzos for 4 years and OD'd on them, opioids and alcohol in 2015 and almost lost my life. Went through a horrific benzo withdrawal for 6 months with crippling anxiety, but I've never felt this hopeless, this depressed, this suicidal.

I used to be the funny extrovert who made everyone laugh. I'm a shell of my former self. I've tried Suboxone but it didn't help. I'm considering going to the doctor to plead for Tramadol as there are studies that show it is an effective antidepressant, but I know it's extremely unlikely and it will just lead to addiction again.

I never thought i‚Äôd be here. I‚Äôm writing this because Of someone I met. shortly had what I believed was a connection found out she is a meth addict. I was very very oblivious to it as I really stereotyped addicts as ‚Äúzombies‚Äù and non functioning and wasn‚Äôt educated. Have no family history or people I know that used. I am now much more aware. all the signs were there. She never stole from me I left her alone at my house often while at work numerous times over 3 months and Looking back it would have been way too easy to clean out my house and disappear, idk maybe that‚Äôs why I think there‚Äôs hope? When I found out (caught using in my house) I told her very politely with no argument I had to take her home and we couldn‚Äôt talk anymore, honestly because it scared me. She didn‚Äôt want to talk about it either just said ‚Äúyeah this was too good to be true I‚Äôm not good enough, you‚Äôre the nicest anyones ever been to me I knew this would end just take me home it‚Äôs fine‚Äù seemed very ashamed. That was over a month ago and now I‚Äôve just been diving deeper and deeper, learning about addiction and finding groups like these. She still occasionally messages me memes, or says she ‚Äúmight have forgot‚Äù things at my house she left over that she wants to get which isn‚Äôt true and I ignore most of it or give dry/deflective responses. She told me ‚Äústories‚Äù like she‚Äôs been physically abused in the past but looking back at the signs it might still be current.

I know addicts really clean up when THEY are ready and I‚Äôm only a stranger but My question for you guys is there anything I can do to HELP her from an addicts perspective? (Or anyone who‚Äôs helped before?) When I say help I don‚Äôt mean miraculously make her stop. I have no wishes right now to romantically Persue her like not even in the slightest. I was initially ignorant and angry and now I just feel bad for not realizing this drug changes your mind. She would talk down on herself a lot. She comes from a very poor family, do I just send a message saying I‚Äôm willing to talk/be a friend? I mean it still seems like she‚Äôs pointlessly reaching out and I don‚Äôt give her drugs or money?? I bought her various personal hygiene products while we spent time at my house that she seemed to appreciate should I still offer to bring some? Is there anything others could have done different for YOU as an addict? I want to just forget about this whole thing but I really just can‚Äôt.

I know a lot of addicts and people in recovery, and it always seems so much harder and more severe for them than it does for me, so I usually don't reach out or talk about things when I am struggling I guess? I don't want to cause problems in their recovery, and I was never taking anything that was ""hard"" or ""severe"" or stereotypically done by an addict. But I'm having a hard time now, and I just want support I guess because I feel like I don't have anyone else to talk to about things. 

I abused sleeping pills for a little while, mostly OTC and if I could get my hands on them prescriptions, but one time I took way too many OTC sleep meds and scared a bunch of people and screwed up my brain and memory pretty badly. After that, I just overkilled it on weed, and after that I grew very hyperfixated on whippits, and then I scared my fiance pretty badly a couple times and now I don't do anything. He doesn't know it's been really hard for me, because he's been in recovery from crack and narcotics for almost 2.5 years, and I don't want to make it harder for him. 

I've been able to stop myself from taking them without much external help, at the most it's insisting people I live with hide anything like what I used to take and focusing on my cat when I get really bad cravings or feel like I can't keep myself from not buying any of it, but today's just... Extra hard. It always gets really hard when life gets hard, and life has been really hard, so not doing anything is hard. 

I really want to, but at the same time I don't. I want to throw everything away and relapse in about 5 ways, and even thinking about my cat isn't helping. Nothing is, and I'm kind of scared of myself right now, and I'm sitting at work just deliberating how bad it would actually be (not very, in my brain right now) to buy a whole bunch of whippets and sleep meds and alcohol and go home and do all of it at once before my fiance gets home so I don't have to face life and everything going on in it. So I won't have to wake up tomorrow and drag myself to work or out on a date or whatever, and pretend that everythings going fine, all my issues are resolved and I'm pleased with all my circumstances. 

I don't think any of my friends would really take me seriously if I talked to them about this because these are just normal things they take without concern. They were hooked on hard stuff, and I'm sitting over here scared of myself for wanting to do whippits and I feel like they'll just think I'm silly because they haven't cared when they've seen me do so many back to back that I turn blue and pass out and no one wakes me up until it's tomorrow morning and my alarm for work is going off. They don't care I'm having conversations with my dead brother in the other room because I took half a bottle of sleeping pills and it's only a problem when I start to lose my shit and wreck the place. 

I think I just don't care anymore. And that scares me a lot. And I think I just want to hear someone tell me they're proud of me for staying ""sober"" for... I don't even know how long, I don't count the days, but I think it would be nice to just hear someone tell me they're proud of me for staying clean, and that it would be better to keep it that way, even if the people around me don't really get that it is a struggle for me and I am having to put a lot of daily active effort into not just falling back into it all again. 

I'm just really tired. And I want to give up, but I also don't, and I feel like wanting to give up is a bit stronger than not right now.

For the most part, it is the worst possible place you have ever been. We enter it with our eyes closed and blind faith. At first, we fumble around in our sobriety and hold on to dear life counting each and every day as a miraculous achievement, and of course, it is just that. As time goes by we celebrate our achievement as another year of evolution where we have grown and matured into the adults we should have become before life and addiction took hold, different people, in different ways.

As we sink deeper into the dynamics of recovery we find we may have recovered to the degree insofar we can delve deeper into our quest. Sometimes we think of our recovery as a destination, counting of the years the date so deeply ingrained into our minds we can count down the days until our next anniversary and this is all part of the joys we find in our newfound freedom from the desire to pick up. This is an important part of our journey and the blessings and gifts along the way.* 

Just for today, I am almost 9yrs sober and clean from my drugs of no choice and I realise now that the true celebration should be done each and every day we are sober and clean, as just for today suggests when we keep it in the day it lightens the load and that dates are egoic projections of a perceived race in which we are the winners or losers. Just for today, I will celebrate this day as I would any other by being kind to myself and others, by keeping an open heart and an unshakeable belief in my god of understanding/higher power.


Today I am humbled by my achievements as I reflect on my journey and marvel at my strength. I will focus on my gratitude for the things that led me here, the people, the places, and the things. The pain, sorrow, and misery of reliving an old story played on a perpetual loop our egoic mantras if you will, these stories take center stage and become our fate for more of the same. Today I will celebrate this day as I would any other by being kind to myself and others, by keeping an open heart and an unshakeable belief in my god of understanding/higher power. This higher power always serves me well and it has never failed me yet. Keep the faith. We do recover!

The spring break of my senior year of college, I decided to gift myself a trip to San Francisco, for the week, to celebrate graduating from college. About half way into my trip I met a guy off of grindr with the intent to get laid. When I arrived he offered something out of this odd shaped pipe, I figured it was weed and took a puff. I was unaware that what I just smoked, was actually meth. It wasn‚Äôt until a few months later that I used again while hooking up with a couple in Seattle, this is when I made the connection to my trip to California. Fast forward to the end of August, and I found myself graduating from smoking meth to injecting it. Meth is something that is plaguing the gay community. It piggy-backs on every gay man‚Äôs false-notion that they have to have porn star sex for hours. I‚Äôve been on this back-and-forth struggle for going on a decade now. My using has never really been consistent, every 6 months for a weekend or two, then I stop. But since losing my job in 2020 because of the Covid pandemic, my use became more frequent, happening twice a month or more for the course of a year. It‚Äôs now 2022 and nothing has change, I‚Äôm having issues maintaining a job, and my use is continuing to increase. 

I know I‚Äôm unhappy, and want to change. I just don‚Äôt know where to start. I‚Äôve been to rehab once before, and am potentially considering it again.

I'll try to make this as succinct as possible. My father has been an addict since he was in his 20s, and he is about 55 now. I think it started with cocaine and lead to other substances, but now it's alcohol. He has been in and out of rehab many times and has multiple DUIs. For the past 10 years or so he hasn't been able to hold down a job, and he stays at my grandparents (his parents) house. I have a few theories for how he is able to still acquire alcohol, even though his parents hide all the car keys in the house from him and don't give him money. They give him a roof over his head, food, and a pack of cigarettes whenever he asks. 

Growing up he was emotionally and physically abusive to me and my mom, so obviously our relationship is not the best. I will always love him because he is my dad, but I do make it an effort to keep a fair distance. Recently he has been drinking a lot, and apparently it has been pretty bad. My grandmother called me last week and is begging for me to convince my grandfather (her husband) to send my dad to a rehab facility. My grandparents are incredibly wealthy so cost is not an issue, but my grandfather doesn't think another round of rehab is going to do anything. 

I have had to play the role of the parent child many times in my life, and I am in therapy for all that I have been through. As much as I feel that it is not my responsibility to have this conversation since I am the kid, my grandmother is so scared that something is going to happen to my Dad I think she's desperate.

I obviously want my dad to get better. My mom always tells me stories of how amazing he was when they first met and during the first few years after I was born. The only reason I have doubts is because of what comes after rehabilitation. Yes my dad will go into a program for 3 months, but what will he do after? Are there some form of work programs for recovering addicts? I'm just worried that he is going to return to the same house, and fall into the same habits as before. And it will all be for nothing. 

So that's why I'm posting here. If anyone has any resources for after treatment I would be more than grateful. Thank you all.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9850680232048035}"

# Hypnotherapy for Addiction

Hypnotherapy for addiction as a treatment is a perfect choice that achieving more and more trustworthiness in the medical and psychiatric spheres. When performed by or under the strict supervision of a highly experienced addiction psychotherapist, this method may benefit those who have previously completed the preliminary phases of therapy dealing with craving and other withdrawal symptoms.

## Hypnotherapy for Addictions¬†Treatment Techniques and Different Approaches

Hypnotherapy as a healing method for addictions may come along in the latest phases of the treatment or it can be a primary strategy from the very üì∑first day. The individuals in quest of cure need to fully cleanse their body prior to considering hypnotherapy for addictions, and typically they spend a significant amount of time cleaning their system up.

Commonly, people with addictions should undergo a detoxification phase in some kind of ‚Äúclosed facilities‚Äù also known as rehab centers in which they spend from 1 to 3 months getting IVs with ‚Äúsalted water‚Äù. Yes, it sounds like a joke, but 99% of the time the IV is only to add water to the bloodstream. The overwatering of the system decreases the concentration of the instances that cause addiction.

The good news is that holistic medicine has the answer for system clean up and in holistic clinics, individuals may receive both detoxification and hypnotherapy treatments concurrently. Also, because hypnotherapy significantly decreases craving and increases patients‚Äô determination the necessity for the locked-down facility becomes obsolete.

### Hypnotherapy for Addiction Treatment

A clinical hypnotherapist is a medical practitioner that provides hypnotherapy for addictions. This specialist leads the convalescing addict into a hypnotic trance that makes a patient more predisposed to thoughts and propositions. In deep stages of hypnotic trance, individuals become more inspired, motivated, and goal-oriented.

Nevertheless, hypnotherapy for addictions is effective only if the individual really wishes to switch off their damaging lifestyles and conducts. Hypnotherapy for addictions does not alternate personal philosophies or create new viewpoints. Hypnotherapy for addictions helps to enhance and cultivate an existing belief. In other words, hypnotherapy for addictions will not make addicts think that the use of drugs is bad. On the opposite, this treatment will make a patient that already decided to quit believe that this is the only right decision.

### Effectiveness of Hypnotherapy for Addictions

Hypnotherapy for addictions is not a universal method, however, it is, for the most part, beneficial in all stages of anti-addiction therapy.

The effectiveness of this treatment technique is close to 100% in men and as high as 85% in women. The statistic shows that men are easier to be treated from addiction to nicotine and alcohol, but women are more cooperative and successful in the case of drug addiction.

### Specialists in Hypnotherapy for Addiction

It is very important to find the right practitioner that will in point of fact perform the healing practice. Due to the fact that in many states regulations that govern who may and may not carry out hypnotherapy are not firm, it is very important to perform a search for the best experts.

It is very important that the hypnotherapy provider you are choosing for your treatment is either a medical doctor or at least a psychologist. Don‚Äôt put your life and your wellness in hands of amateurs, imposters, and delitants. Any specialist practicing hypnotherapy as a treatment should have a significant medical background. The easiest way to find a certified specialist is to ¬†google for hypnotherapy for addictions and your city and look for results from either psychologytoday.com or healthprofs.com. Both these sites carefully verify each provider‚Äôs credentials. Choosing any practitioner from these organizations will guarantee you a licensed and professional services.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9838846325874329}"

I've been in therapy for 13 years for anxiety and depression. I think what finally turned me onto alcohol (when I was 20) was that it gave me so many things I couldn't give myself. It was a quick fix. It gave me a building block to begin a foundation I couldn't build on my own.

My alcoholism, depression, and anxiety co-exist now; but my alcoholism is a symptom of my mental illness, not the cause. Alcohol gave me a personality. It gave me a social life that I was too anxious to have sober. It made some of my hobbies more enjoyable. It made me not afraid to stand up for myself.¬†It took away my shaky hands (which may be caused by anxiety, or a neurological disorder). I could do anything, handle anything. 

I went to my intake today for IOP, and as soon as my clinician said ""you have to look inside yourself in order to move forward,"" my brain short circuited.

I have no hobbies I really enjoy without alcohol. I don't enjoy talking to others. I don't know where to start. I have no motivation to find out.

My aunt has a lot of mental health and alcohol issues. She was living with her daughter for 15 years until her daughter kicked her out back in September. Long story short, my aunt was being verbally and mentally abused by her grandson‚Äôs friends that now controlled that house and she cried everyday about it to me. Finally, my aunt stood up for herself and told the manager that these guys were living there without being added to the lease and the manager told them the guys have to move out. That‚Äôs why her daughter kicked her out. Anyway, my aunt moved into a cheap motel for 2 weeks until I finally gave in and told her she could stay with me for a few months until she saves up some money and gets her life in order. I found a room 3 months later within walking distance from me so we checked it out and she agreed to live with a friendly woman also in her 60s. Everything seemed like it was working out, my aunt seemed to have her life in order again. Then her best friend called me 4 days ago and asked me to take my aunt back in. I asked why, this friend told me the new housemate was taking advantage of my aunt financially, basically my aunt paid for a Costco membership, paid for all the groceries, etc. Apparently my aunt bought this lady and herself a 12 pack of beer every night and they were drinking excessively. 

So I told my aunts friend, I‚Äôll talk to the both of them and see if we can get this resolved. The friend asked why I just don‚Äôt take my aunt back and I told her that I want to try and talk to them first. Her friend then goes, ‚Äúwell she drinks a lot with this lady, when she stays with you, she only has a 6 pack every night‚Ä¶‚Äù I kinda hinted to her friend that that‚Äôs the whole problem. 

So I need some advice, should I try moving my aunt back in and deal with her BS until I find a new housemate for her or do I tell her she needs to stand up for herself, don‚Äôt pay for everything and cut down on her drinking? 

It‚Äôs so mentally draining for me because my aunts friend accuses me of not caring since I have an empty room available.

Basically, I feel even if I got her a new housemate and found her a new room to rent, she‚Äôd still fall into trouble because she can‚Äôt say no to people. She insists on paying for everything and she likes to buy beer for people because she wants people to drink a lot with her everyday. So yes, the housemate is probably taking advantage of that but a lot of other people would be doing the same and I tell my aunt to stop paying for people and start learning how to say no. She claims she‚Äôs afraid people won‚Äôt like her if she says no. I always cringe when she tells me that because it sounds like something a child would say.

I‚Äôm 25, male. I watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas when I was twelve and after it finished I walked back to my bedroom as if I was on ether, downloading Hunter‚Äôs personality completely. My sisters friend told her I was ‚Äúfucked‚Äù when he found out it was my favourite movie and novel. Despite how dark the trips were in the movie I romanticised it. Just like I romanticised the life of Kurt Cobain and Jim Morrison, my idols. I carry the pain of being a creative entity. Feeling too much and forever living inside of my head. I smoked weed from 12 onwards and binged alcohol at parties. I became fascinated with psychonaut explorations with psychedelics from age 16 onwards despite the ghost tour guide in high school telling me psychedelics ‚Äúdamage your spiritual webs‚Äù. 
When I was 18 I got drug induced psychosis for a year from eating a meth pill.
I continued to use and party regardless.
5 years later age 23 I went to rehab. It saved my life. From drinking morning to night, from snorting mountains of crushed dexamphetamine and benzos. From spending my rent money on ketamine. I‚Äôve hit rock bottom so many times and relapsed so many times back into the depths of psychosis, nearing death and hurting loved ones and still I ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to use. I keep falling back into the trap of romanticising the emotional pain of addiction and life. But with every relapse it gets easier to stop using.
Right now I‚Äôm abusing coffee and cigarettes, caffeinated into oblivion. Stoicism is my philosophy of nature.
Although I do become quite nihilistic when I‚Äôm coming down.
The quest to know yourself never ends and you must know yourself well to pull yourself out of addiction.
Just remember recovered addicts blossom into the most beautiful people.
After traversing the extreme lows of emotions addiction creates you come back even better than ever in sober time.

There‚Äôs a lot of things I stopped doing that made me happy because being drunk made me happier, it made me whole. But it‚Äôs all an illusion that alcohol does to you. It makes you think you‚Äôre happy. 

Don‚Äôt embarrass yourself like I did. I‚Äôve put alot of people I love/d, through so much unnecessary turmoil. It almost feels like it‚Äôs not real. Learn from me and my mistakes and do some thinking about the damage you can do simply for taking a drink.

There‚Äôs an old saying that goes ‚Äúa man takes a drink, the drink takes the drink, then the drink takes the man.‚Äù I never understood it until now. 

For those wondering, nothing bad happened for me to be here telling you this story, I just got tired of my own shit so I am taking the steps to get help, it might take time but that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9947386384010315}"

Last year I decided to ease off on pornography and only ‚Äúuse‚Äù the shit on weekends with very heavy restrictions on when and how much I could ‚Äúuse‚Äù the shit. This year a I finally decided to take the plunge and finally quit for good. I made it 43 days without ‚Äúusing‚Äù the shit, however I did sometimes browse the shit from time to time to kill the time as my parents had taken away my computer because of my underachieving grades (I don‚Äôt have many hobbies outside of computer centric activities), I was set to get my computer back this Wednesday and then after that I‚Äôd stop looking at the shit entirely.

On the 13th I decided to go out for one last peek at the shit, I didn‚Äôt even necessarily want too but I did anyway, while browsing I found some shit that was just good enough to set me off without my input.
I feel absolutely terrible right now, I feel like I‚Äôve killed a man, I feel like I‚Äôve killed a part of myself. I knew the risks and I still went for it. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I feel like I‚Äôve lost everything, like my whole world is crumbling right in front of me, I know I have to keep abstaining but what‚Äôs the point of doing what I‚Äôm doing if I can just fail like that? I don‚Äôt even feel like a deserved my computer back or really anything good anymore. 
I don‚Äôt even really know what I want from this post, I think I want to know if this is entirely my fault (although it probably is I‚Äôm just trying to avoid the responsibility and guilt), or maybe I just want to be comforted or told I am still deserving of good things? Or maybe I‚Äôm looking for some kind of praise for some kind of improvement, maybe I just want to vent.

Found out the other day that they've been hiding their current relapse from me for months now. I've had to take them to the ER 4 times in the past month. They were recently diagnosed with a certain chronic disorder and we thought that was the cause of these episodes. We were even at one point both under the impression that it might even be a very serious and deadly disease and sought out specialists to get tests done. 

One of the ERs we visited, which we went to twice, was fucking terrible and gave us no information whatsoever. They just gave them fluids and sent them home. It wasn't until the 3rd hospitalization that they told us ""hey by the way...you're extremely intoxicated and that might be exacerbating the chronic illness you have"". This shocked me because on the way to the hospital I asked them if they had anything to drink tonight and they said no, and i believed them because I was around them for the entire night and didn't see them drink a single drop of alcohol. When the nurse told us this I became extremely suspicious but thought I was overthinking things. We agreed: no more alcohol whatsoever. 

I made sure to keep a good eye on them just in case, to make sure they weren't drinking, and for a couple weeks it seemed like they were making good on their promise. They had a few mild ""episodes"" after that that coincided with the chronic illness they were diagnosed with. And during those smaller episodes, they told me they had nothing to drink and I believed them because, again, I was around them and didn't see them drink at all. 

Then the other day we had to take them to the ER again. I was beyond freaked out. We hadn't really gotten anything definite back from the specialist we were seeing and I thought the worst was going to happen; that they were going to die. I picked them up from the hospital and asked them again, ""did you drink tonight?"" and they told me ""no"". When we got home I noticed they did something weird: they went into our second bathroom, which I have never seen them use before. The second they came out I went in, did a quick search, and found a gigantic bottle of vodka hidden in one of the drawers. I confronted them about it and they finally admitted that they've been drinking HEAVILY these past few months, secretly and in incredibly elaborate ways, and using the fact that they were coincidentally, and legitimately, diagnosed with a chronic disorder to cover it up. I called their parents and we all set up an appointment at a rehab center.

I wasn't even mad at the elaborate betrayal or the lies and manipulation. I was, and am, just legitimately terrified, disturbed, and worried. I dropped them off today and while I'm glad they agreed to seek help I still mostly feel like I'm in shock and it hasn't really hit me yet. I have my own current struggles and history with substance abuse and addiction so I understand and just want to help. I just hate myself for not figuring this out/noticing this sooner. They aren't the type of person to normally lie or manipulate so I believed everything they told me. They might be in rehab for 3 months and there's no in-person visiting because COVID and I feel exhausted in every possible way. I know they're in good hands but I'm shocked that it went this far/got this bad. They're one of the nicest, sweetest, and most selfless persons I've ever met and I just want them to be okay.",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987044334411621}"

I just took the classic addict route, I kept pushing until the consequences hit real hard. I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy, I‚Äôm just trying to process this.

I‚Äôm so disgusted by what I‚Äôve done that I‚Äôm not capable of typing it yet‚Ä¶ Because I know; my intellectual side is basically telling me you can‚Äôt go more wrong than this. Not just injuring yourself, but also putting others through lifelong issues.

‚Ä¶ I think my emotional side still is hoping this will turn out all good, but it won‚Äôt, not this time. I might have screwed up before but this, oh shit, this is vile. There are so many levels of wrong doing, and the full scope of this hasn‚Äôt even been revealed yet.

- I better just type some of the details, this is turning out pretty unclear.
Contracted at least one blood STD, Hepatitis, afraid of HIV too to be honest. Married, pregnant wife at contraction, and a 4,5 y/o. This is about 6 month after that, because I‚Äôm showing symptoms and waiting for my hepatitis test result. I did screen for the regular STD:s before.

As I said, this is abominable, and I‚Äôm not looking for any petty. I‚Äôm merely typing this out for myself to process it. I know what kind of comments I‚Äôll get already, because I wrote a similar post before during these events. And I fully agreed with every death wish.

Unfortunately I took the full addict arc. I thought I could manage until I couldn‚Äôt. Thought I was safe until I wasn‚Äôt. Thought I was in control until I wasn‚Äôt. Now I‚Äôve put several lives in danger, and I‚Äôd probably continued if I would‚Äôve gotten away with it.

I‚Äôve straight up lied to my spouses face, even though she basically caught me. Her gut told her things weren‚Äôt adding up, but I stayed true to my (false) narrative. And this isn‚Äôt even the worst part. Reflecting upon my own behaviors I‚Äôm a complete self-centered coward; if I was truly worried more about them than me, I would‚Äôve come clean a long time ago to precede potential risks. Now I‚Äôm still waiting for the test results, although I‚Äôm pretty sure what it will say this time, my symptoms are clear. 

This is beyond repair, this is putting other lives in danger for a fix, and it‚Äôs pathetic that I haven‚Äôt manned up, I‚Äôm well aware.

Divorce is coming up and a life in solitude on my behalf. I couldn‚Äôt face anyone after this. But the fact that I‚Äôve ruined my wife‚Äôs life and the upbringing of my two children is so much worse. I mean, it seems fair if she never wants to see me again, nor let me have anything to do with our children. And this is pure pain. And on top of that, there‚Äôs a great risk of life long chronic decease.

- - -

What I can‚Äôt wrap my head around is how I got here. I‚Äôm not stupid, on the contrary, people often regards me as clever and thoughtful. My moral compass was fine growing up, but in retrospect I can see it got screwed over time. And I had a decent upbringing, even though my parents were divorced. I thought I was too smart to possibly have caught some of the worsts STD:s known. On top of that - I‚Äôm a high school science teacher - I‚Äôm supposed to teach my students not to make these mistakes. I‚Äôm so detached from this side of my persona, it doesn‚Äôt feel like I could do these things.

I should just put an end to this pathetic monologue. As I said, this is probably some of the worst things you can put another person through, I‚Äôm well aware.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9995428323745728}"

As a very impressionable teenager back then, one who thought ""ah, everyone does this,"" I didn't realize how out of hand I'd let it get. Like I said, this has been going on for nearly five years. I'm on the cusp of graduating high school, and I can barely remember it because since seventh fucking grade, all I've been able to think about was the next time I'd be able to feel good, the next time I'd be able to get those natural chemical releases that made me feel happy for once. It took me a long time to realize I wasn't happy. I realized that I hadn't even given myself the chance to explore and assess my sexuality because all I've been doing is caving to my urges. I'm 90% sure I'm asexual (or some form of it), because sex itself is uncomfortable for me, but because my brain got hooked onto porn and masturbation and the chemicals that come with it as an impressionable teenager, I was never able to think about my sexuality without it being rerouted into thinking about masturbation. I hate it. Caving into it makes me feel weak, it makes me chase a supposed feeling of happiness and relief that never lives up to what I really need, which is actual intrinsic happiness and satisfaction. I hate masturbating, yet every single person around me is talking about how it's a natural part of human development and about how they're so horny- I can't fucking stand it. I made it 11 days without getting all the way into it, and then a video popped up on my feed that sent me tumbling back into the rabbit hole. I didn't even have to try to masturbate, it happened on its own. 11 days of doing everything I could to stay clean and uphold a somewhat 'sober' lifestyle, only for it to fall flat without me even getting the chance to stop it. The most I've gotten to has been 30 days, and I've only been able to low-ball it since. I just want to be done with this. I'm so tired every single day, and I put so much brainpower into trying to save myself from my addicted impulses. I want to remember my life, I want to know what I spent my life doing before I lose it. I want to be clean, but I can't do enough to help myself. The worst thing about living in this time is that, unlike cigarettes or other drugs, porn is an unlimited resource you can access anywhere at anytime. You don't have to go to desperate lengths to get your hands on it, all you need is one bad day and it'll be there waiting for you. On your phone, on your computer, on your iPad, on your TV if you're that fucking insane. I feel so trapped. I just want to be able to live.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982049465179443}"

2022-02-14 14:27:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ssizl3/my_brother_finally_called_me/,My brother finally called me.,"Update: I first want to start by thanking everyone for their kind words and advice. It truly meant more than you can ever imagine. This update isn‚Äôt the one I was hoping for but one that I thought might happen. I apologize if this is long. 

I flew down with my best friend Thursday morning with the understanding that I would see him that afternoon. We had been communicating since he called me on Sunday. He even offered to pick me up from the airport, which I politely declined. I called and texted all afternoon, the phone was ringing and going to voicemails. My friend and I drove by where he was staying hoping we might see him outside or in the area. He didn‚Äôt respond to me until around 8pm and said sorry his phone was off and then stopped responding again. 

Friday we woke up and came up with a plan that if he didn‚Äôt call me back or text me by 3PM I would request a wellness check. We actually weren‚Äôt sure how wellness checks work in that area so we drove to the local police station just to get some information. The officer I spoke with was so kind and empathetic which isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve experienced before with officers in situations regarding addicts. She gave me all the information I needed and included her personal cellphone number and asked that I update her if I hear back from my brother. 

He texted me in the afternoon saying that his and the girl he‚Äôs with were going to sign a lease and should be done by 3:30pm. My friend and I were went to the hotel at 2:30pm and camped out by the parking lot entrance - this hotel only have one entrance into the parking lot so we would be able to see them come and go. By 4pm we haven‚Äôt seen them so I call him and he actually answered and said ‚Äúoh we just got back‚Äù and I said ‚Äúok we‚Äôll I‚Äôm outside your hotel, you need to come downstairs‚Äù. 20 minutes later they both came down. My friend moved the car because next to the entrance of the hotel has a little seating area where I was going to move them to so we could sit and talk. She wanted to be able to see me good forbid anything happened. 

My heart sank when I saw him but I held in my tears. They are both so skinny. My brother specially is about 5‚Äô11 and couldn‚Äôt be more than 115 pounds. He had sores around his mouth from the crack pipe and track marks on his arms. His cheeks were hallow. He‚Äôs never looked worse, but I‚Äôm glad I had people prepare me to an extent, but it was still heartbreaking. 

I kept the conversation light with them since they were both together because my goal was to get him alone to have a conversation. I did offer them both help and said I will drive them home both right now if they were ready. But they said they weren‚Äôt. However she said she was going to work at a bar at 6pm and I took that opportunity to tell my bother ‚Äúperfect let me take you for dinner!‚Äù He was declining at first but the girl he‚Äôs with encouraged him to go. 

At dinner is where I got more serious. He doesn‚Äôt even remember calling me and saying those things. He only remembered parts when I texted him Monday saying I wasn‚Äôt driving down that day but I booked my flight for Thursday morning. He tried to tell me they‚Äôre not using as much as I think they are. I looked him right in the eyes and said ‚Äúyou are addicts and you are lying to me‚Äù. 

He told me all these plans they had about moving down permanently to where they are. Reasons they couldn‚Äôt come home. All the things people say when they aren‚Äôt ready. I‚Äôm proud of myself for not getting emotional because I needed him to know how serious I was about the things I was going to say next. 

He told me that they planned on getting sober on 5/1 and I asked ‚Äúwhat are they waiting for‚Äù and he just closed his eyes and cried. He said ‚ÄúOur heads are above water‚Äù and I said that‚Äôs not enough. I reminded him of the value he has, and the support he has and that while he will have to face his trauma when he gets sober that I will be there to support him. I reminded him that his best friend who doesn‚Äôt use (most of his friends also use back home) is desperate to here from him and to know he‚Äôs ok. She‚Äôs even offered that if he gets clean he can move in with her states away for a fresh start to get away from all his old friends and still have a support system. 

He told me he‚Äôs not ready and doesn‚Äôt want help. I told him that if he continues like this I cannot have a relationship with him. That I can‚Äôt worry about if he‚Äôs dead or alive. I can‚Äôt spend my time calling random phone numbers hoping it‚Äôs his. That I can‚Äôt call police stations and hotels go find out information. That my mental health is can‚Äôt suffer because of his addiction. 

He got so angry and started yelling at me asking how I could do this to him. That I‚Äôm the only person that has loved him through this no matter what. That I‚Äôm the only person he cares about enough to checkin with when he‚Äôs ready. That I‚Äôm the only person who tries to make sure he‚Äôs ok. I said I that I am not doing this to him, that his addiction is. He asked if he‚Äôs invited to my wedding in September and I said if you are not sober I cannot have you there. He started hitting the car dashboard and crying. He said he was getting out of the car and that they were planning to come home next weekend to visit for a few days. 

I told him that he can call me but I will not answer. I told him that I loved him and I will always be there for him and that when he‚Äôs ready for help I will be there. I hugged him and cried and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid this is the last time I‚Äôm going to see you‚Äù. He got out of the car and sat on the curb of the hotel entrance and cried. I drove away. 

I obviously was hoping that the outcome was going to be different that he would come home and get help. That she would come home and get help. I knew that on a human level if he was ready and she wasn‚Äôt I would have to figure out a way to get her home. I‚Äôm friends with her sister and wouldn‚Äôt be able to leave her there on her own but I also knew going into it that they wouldn‚Äôt leave without each other.

I didn‚Äôt cry and haven‚Äôt cried since I left him. I went back to my hotel and slept and the next morning my friend and I got coffee and walked the beach before our flight. We actually saw a group of dolphins in the ocean which gave me this odd sense of peace. I know I did the right thing when he called me on Sunday and offered everything I could. But I set more boundaries around our relationship, ones that I will not go back on. 

I have to regrets about going down and maybe I‚Äôm stupid to be hopeful that what I said left an impact and will help them realize it‚Äôs time for help, but I‚Äôm being realistic that they are going to continue to use until the end. Whatever their end maybe. 


Original:My brother has been in active addiction for the last 10 years. I‚Äôve watched him go from this giant personality who could light up a room to someone I no longer recognize. 

He‚Äôs been missing since before thanksgiving and changed his phone number and hasn‚Äôt talked to anyone. His mail still goes to our dads house and I‚Äôve been texting and calling the numbers on the phone bill just saying that I love him and I am always here for him no matter what. 

Last night he finally called me just saying he loved me that he missed me and how sorry he was and that he needs me. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is his cry for help but I will never give up on him. I booked my flights to where he is and will be going down Thursday with the hopes that I can bring him home and get him into treatment. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to say when I get down there or really even what I should do. Any advice would be beyond appreciated. Even if this isn‚Äôt the time and he‚Äôs not ready, I just want him to know that no matter what when he‚Äôs ready I will be there.",39,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9951168298721313}"

So since Feb last year I got myself on heroin which has been the darkest time in my life. It all started so well but quickly deteriorated and before I knew it it‚Äôs been a year already. It basically started when I started to see my ex and he started coming round but he only smokes crack normally but would occasionally smoke heroin with me. It started just being the weekends and we would have so much fun, we would have a smoke and stay up all weekend watching films and having a laugh and I felt amazing, I suffer with lifelong depression and anxiety but when I smoked I felt really confident and enjoyed life but this started to creep into the week so I would have a smoke while working which actually made me work so hard and my concentration was crazy, never been able to concentrate like this before and I really enjoyed my job, I would work really hard and before I knew hours would pass. It was crazy and I loved it. One weekend I went to my mates for a drink, I came back went bed and slept most of the next day but then the sickness started and I was being sick for a straight 24hours which was horrible and really drained me, after the sickness I was so ill, I could do anything so stayed in bed in pain, never felt anything like it and this went on for another day or two and started to slowly get better but my mate would come round and bring me a bag, I‚Äôd tell him no I can‚Äôt but I would end up having it shortly after. I knew my ex wanted to get back with me but wasn‚Äôt interested and I think he wanted me on gear so I needed him, so I would keep buying it and buying him crack too cos he really pushed and hinted for me to keep having it which I know now I shouldn‚Äôt have listened or got him back out my life but this was really hard because I knew after a couple of lines I would feel amazing again. Well I finally accepted I was an addict and ensured I always had some so I wouldn‚Äôt get sick and not be able to work and this is when I became used to it and needed more until it got to the point where I can‚Äôt really get high anymore and ending up spending most my wages on it and slowly became in debt so decided I can‚Äôt go on like this and got on a meth program which I had high hopes for. At first although I didn‚Äôt experience any harsh withdrawals I still found it hard not having a smoke and feeling like I can‚Äôt concentrate so for the past 3 months I‚Äôve really cut down but crave like mad then when I had 5 days of just meth I called the meth program and asked to be reduced which they advised would be a mistake so I started to lower myself and save up the rest & I had 2 full bottles so left the program and trying to get off all this before it runs out, I have a bottle and half left which I think will last at least a month, maybe a month and half. I‚Äôm struggling so much to keep my job but at the same time finding it really difficult work without a smoke and the cravings are crazy üòîüò© does anyone have any tips for me or even any success stories like my position please or anyone else in the same position?

I‚Äôm a great liar, and too proud of it. I‚Äôve been hooked on pills for about a year. I‚Äôve managed to avoid becoming physically dependent on anything because I switch up what I do very frequently, I basically have a rotation of 7 or 8 drugs that I enjoy. Of course I have a favorite, oxy, but I tried to spread things out like I said to not build a tolerance or physical dependence on anything. I thought I ‚Äúoutsmarted‚Äù addiction. I couldn‚Äôt possible become addicted, but I recently realized that addiction is a mental game, not a physical one. I have yet to actually face any hard consequences of my abuse, which is another reason I never considered myself ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù. 

I am a college student with big plans for the future. I want to go to law school and work in health law. Too many people are getting fucked by the system (but that‚Äôs another post). I am doing well in school, 3.7 and making deans list every semester. Scored a 165 on my first practice LSAT. So I know law school is obtainable, but I would be doing even better in school if I quit all the pills. 

Currently my biggest problem is that I am an athlete at my school. I have yet to be drug tested because they are random, but I would be absolutely fucked if I was tested. (Though maybe they would assume it‚Äôs an error if I tested positive for everything lol.) I don‚Äôt even want to think about the consequences of that. For weed, most people just get a warning for the first positive test, but I have heard my school is super strict about anything else. I would likely be cut from the team, and that would be bad for many reasons. Aside from losing the little scholarship money I get (I play a pretty niche sport, so even at the top level we don‚Äôt get much money), I would be losing all of my best friends. My team has become my family. I love them with all of my heart and would do anything for them. 

My head coach told me at practice yesterday that he noticed that I had lost weight and it was seemingly muscle mass that I lost, and he knows I‚Äôve been in the gym everyday so it didn‚Äôt make sense to him. I think he was concerned might I have an ED. I finally came clean to him and told him everything. I told him about my shitty childhood full of abuse, both physical and mental, how my dad hates me for being gay, my suicide attempt, and my drug problems. It felt really good to open up and tell someone something. Like I said, I‚Äôm good at hiding things, and because of trust issues, I hide most things from most people.  His reaction was better than I ever could have imagined. He basically told me that he‚Äôs been in my position before and that he will do whatever he can to help me, and he doesn‚Äôt want to get me in trouble, with school or my parents.

We came up with a plan together to help me. Firstly we are going to meet at least once a week and talk, I have to keep him updated. I can call him anytime for any reason. If either of us think I need it at any point, he will arrange professional help. If I show up to practice, team meetings, games, or anything else drunk or high he will make me leave. And if I drink or use the day before or day of a game I will be riding the bench. And biggest of all if I lie to him about any of this, he will have to talk to the school. This may seem way too loose, like he should be making me stop everything all at once, but he knows because he‚Äôs been in my position that this is the best starting place, and this is how we will build trust in each other. I know that over time he will tighten up his ‚Äúrules‚Äù for me. I am so incredibly grateful to him. He treated me with nothing but acceptance, love and respect. He made sure to tell me not to feel guilty or ashamed, and that we will get me through this together.

1. I work for a union
2. My boss is understanding and compassionate

Personally, I think they'd be SHOCKED to find out about my addiction or that I'm a member of Narcotics Anonymous and have been for over 2 years now.

For those who may have been through this before how should I approach this with work? I've considered going to my union rep before approaching my boss but I don't know if that is standard protocol or not. 

Currently, I plan to start the conversation by saying to the office manage something along these lines, ""If I needed to take a two week leave of absence who/where would I go to address that?""

I can‚Äôt believe I am finally writing this. It‚Äôs been a long time coming. Long overdue, to say the very least.  The last thirty years with you has been one big roller coaster ride. We‚Äôve been through many ups and downs in life. 

I could still vividly recall the first time we met. I was 15 years old and in high school. My friends and I chipped in and paid someone to buy you for us. We all drank at Pacific Avenue in Stockton that day. Back then, it was the cool thing to do. I wanted to be one of the cool guys that everyone wants to hang out with. That very first experience with you turned out to be the first of many.  

In all my milestones you were there ‚Äì high school graduation, first job, first paycheck, first enlistment, first car, first marriage, first child, first home‚Ä¶ it was pretty cool that you were there during all those firsts in my life‚Ä¶. man, you truly made a mark!

You were there during the many times I failed: my first divorce, my first foreclosure, my first garnishment‚Ä¶ my first grief. You were there by my side when I lost my first love. The most beautiful part of my existence: my mother. She was everything to me. When I lost her, I had also lost a huge part of myself. 

Apart from the pain of losing the love of my life, there‚Äôs the other kind of pain. Serving in the Army was no easy feat. I had to deal with a lot of stress and trauma. For 24 years, I coped with the physical and mental pain through self-medication. I had to put up a strong face even though I was slowly dying on the inside. I wanted to give up, but I could not stand the disappointment that it would cause my family. So I learned how to fake my feelings, my emotions. It was hard to pretend that I was happy, when I was really this angry, frustrated, lonely person carrying a lot of baggage. 

Through all my ups and downs, you were the only constant in my life. You never left my side. You were always there to hold my hand. And I misconstrued that for loyalty, for trust, for love. When all it was was Control. Deception. Betrayal.

I‚Äôm not very good with goodbyes. Goodbyes are always painful. But I have to accept that nothing lasts forever. It‚Äôs time to part ways, my old friend. Before I close this final chapter of our relationship, let me leave you with one of my favorite Bible quotes: For everything there is a season. A time for every activity under heaven. A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest. Ecclesiastes 3:1-8.

I knew my life would get fucked up, but this fucked up was unimaginable.

I had a severe lung infection last yr from a combination of smoking dope and asperating due vommitting. They diagnosed it as asperation pneumonia, but it was a very unclear diagnosis. It was so traumatizing, and my fear relapsing this time was it recurring again, it did exactly that. About two weeks ago I asperated, and my lung infection, or, whatever it is, came back full force. I've been to the er 3 times already, and they don't know what's wrong with me, yet again. My O2 levels are extremely low. I can't get any sleep without waking up in the middle of the night and struggling to catch my breath. Constant coughing and wheezing. It's been a nightmare. I'm reliving it all over again.

 I'm trying to not smoke dope, but snorting it doesn't really do anything for me, and it feels like dope is the only thing that slightly subsides the pain of this. 
I'm back to being dope sick again, my tolerance is high and I'm spending all of my money on this shit; I had 1k in savings, which is the most I've ever had saved up in my entire life, now I'm in the negatives. only after 1 month of using. 1 month. 

I'm out of work due to this lung infection and also the fear of getting dope sick while at work. I've been at this job for 6 mo and it was the only source of stability that I had. and I'm on the fringe of getting fired. 

I admitted to my family I had a relapse, I just wanted to be honest and tell on myself, that was a huge mistake. My family has been so proud of me, they finally had trust in me, they were happy for me, for the first time in years I felt like I had my family back. Now they have lost all trust in me and my recovery. We are barely on talking terms, and when we are it's very awkward and I'm constantly berated with questions and accusations. 

My relationship with my partner is slowly falling apart due to both of us using, and our relationship for 8 months of both having clean time was so strong, healthy, and communicative and now it's in fucking shambles again. 

My mental and physical health is plummeting. Relapsing was so god damn not worth it. It's crazy that after only a month of using my life is back to where it was 8 months ago. It's true, when you relapse you just end up back exactly where you were, if not worse. This shit is so evil. This drug is so fucking evil. For anyone contemplating relapsing, I really hope you find the strength inside yourself to not do it, to just stay clean and sober for today, for tonight, for the next hour, for the next second. You're worth so much more than this. You can overcome the cravings as hard as it is. it's not worth it. I wish I told myself this before I relapsed, I wish I replayed those fucking tapes. Remember how you felt right before you got sober and why you got sober. It's not fucking worth it for any drug or drink. You'll end up right back to the same place, there's no rock bottom, it can always get worse, and it will. It always does.",30,{'infect': 3},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.999180257320404}"

But this is rapidly changing, I have been falling in love  with a girl I recently met, and even though while things were really uncertain with her my stress caused my drug use to skyrocket, now that we have made some steps that make me think (knock on wood) this relationship could actually evolve to where I so desperately desire it to, that is, that she loves me back, I have all of a sudden lost most of my desire to get high because there is nothing that I desire more in the world than to be able to be with her, healthy and clean, to give to her all of the good things I am capable of giving, cherish her with all of my unadulterated heart and thoughts, and fucking LIVE this life with her, till the end if God permits.

I'm crying like a river writing these lines and no, I'm far from being a teenager experiencing his first love.

I am cleaning my act up as fast as I can. It's not that I could not be honest with her, I haven't told her anything about it but she's such a free spirit with an open mind that I would have no shame it telling her my life's story in details.

It's just that I don't wanna be that person with her. I think I've finally realized that that gaping hole in my heart I was filling up with drugs was that absence of a significant other in my life.

The non physically addictive drugs are already stopped. I think I still need a couple of days, one week tops to get rid of benzos and opiates cuz you know, avoiding to die would be best, but never in my life have I been se motivated to quit.

I'm ready to endure whatever withdrawal has in store for me. That pain, when I think of it as a way to be free to enjoy life with her means nothing at all to me. I'd do anything. Withdrawal, have at me, here I am and here I'll stand, proudly and relentlessly blow after blow until my step is firm and my hands stable.

But that also scares me to death. What if things don't pan out as I hope they will? I've had post break-up depressions in the past that have led me to suicide attempts that nearly succeeded.

Also, I can't help but wondering whether it's that better to become that attached to a person than to a drug. Drugs in my experience are more reliable than people. How will I cope? How will I survive in between ""fixes"" (seeing her, texting her, calling her...). And we all know relationships end one way or the other, with separation or death. So how much better is that really if she leaves me and I just kill myself?

I'm not reducing her to a drug of course, she's a wonderful woman, the analogy is just made by my sick brain, but that is the way I seem to work psychologically.

There are some days/weeks that are good and I sleep well and then I am back to this. At 16 I started self-medicating to help me sleep and I would take literally anything that had a sedative in it: anti-allergies, painkillers, cough syrups. I would never take more than the prescribed amount but I would still take them regularly. 
I would stop in the middle when I had moments of panic about what I was doing and then I‚Äôd go back to it.
When I went to university, I start taking clonazepam almost regularly and if I couldn‚Äôt get that I would take lexotinal. It really ducked me up and I had a breakdown at one point where I confessed to friends that I felt like an addict, and I abused prescription pills. 
I have worked really hard on stopping this and have mostly not succumbed except for short periods or where my mental state has been in a place where I need something to put me to sleep. At times I don‚Äôt even know if the medicine will help me sleep, I just want to take it and hope that it does. 

However, sometimes I‚Äôll see these medicines around or develop random cravings to take them despite not experiencing any issues. 
I recently started taking levosulpiride again which a doctor had recommended to me sometime ago but the prescription had ended. There‚Äôs no reason for me to have started it except that I have had a few bad nights despite having ample time to make up for the lost sleep but I saw the pack and I couldn‚Äôt help it and I noticed how all day today all I could think of was planning how to get more once I ran out.

I know that'll only make it worse, plus it'll ruin what good things have been going on in my life lately. But for years, getting my response to distress was to get wasted. My therapist is helping me learn new coping skills. They do help. But there's a certain pleasure in being so far gone that nothing matters. Until the crash, I guess.

I'm not going back. I've made it this far, I'm not going to throw it all away. I just wanted to say it all somewhere. I haven't told anyone about my liver, yet. I'm waiting for more answers before I tell my friends and boyfriend. I don't want to worry them more than I have to. Maybe the treatment can be all quiet, even. We'll see.

I have far more experience in N.A and have been in and out of the rooms since 2015. One of my questions has to do with step six (or whichever one it is about ‚ÄúAsking god to remove character defects‚Äù) and about how the program expresses the importance of taking accountability while also believing that bad behavior can only be changed by ‚ÄúGod‚Äù and not ourselves (in other words, there seems to be a contradiction about who is responsible for our own behavior and changing said behavior).  
         He sent me a screenshot of a quote saying that ‚Äústep one is about how we are powerless over our addiction AND bad behaviors‚Äù implying that our acceptance of this ‚Äúfact‚Äù is crucial to be able to advance in the program. However, I‚Äôm pretty sure the one about behavior isn‚Äôt technically part of step one as last I checked step one covers addiction/alcoholism itself, not other symptoms that manifest. I‚Äôve been having other questions that definitely complicate my ability to work the program but based on this one admission alone my sponsor let me go instantly and did so at the drop of a hat with zero hesitation, expressing frustration while accusing me of ‚Äúwasting his time‚Äù. That was it. 
        I was supposed to go to a meeting to speak and tell my story this upcoming Wednesday but obviously that‚Äôs not happening anymore. If this is the reaction I‚Äôm going to get by simply having questions about things, it seems like A.A is just a fucking echo chamber and an actual cult who are not capable of critical thinking, no different than a fundamentalist Conservative Christian stuck in their ways. Fortunately I‚Äôve had at least two other people in the program disagree with what my former sponsor said.

I wasn‚Äôt using at the time but I wasn‚Äôt honest with her about how I used close to three months before . A week ago on a Thursday I had a seizure and woke up in her bathroom and told her I passed out and was yelling for her help. I told her that I was on drugs . Idk why I told her that I just did apparently on the way to the hospital . I don‚Äôt remember the whole day because I had a seizure and forgot. She stayed with me throughout the CT scan and everything . When we got home the next morning . Seizure happened at 10 pm . went to ER and was in ER until 6am . I could tell she was done with me. The most pain I have felt In my life . I love this woman. She‚Äôs made me feel normal for a while now. I was so ashamed because I felt like I overdosed . Turns out opiates weren‚Äôt in my system . Or heroin . Etc I have been so conditioned to fucked up things I believed it was normal thing to say . It must have been the drugs. I‚Äôve only had one seizure before in my life 6 years prior and was sober then as well. But after ten years of autonomy usage I just figured i did drugs and passed out. The urine panel came back clean and I started questioning deeper things. Why did I jump to saying I did drugs that must have been why I passed out? Why did I say anything about drugs if I hadn‚Äôt used in months. Usually my go to is a perk/Roxy . About 3-4 at once . Well I haven‚Äôt had them recently. She told me after finding out about a clean urine test if I took a hair test she‚Äôd begin to believe me . That‚Äôs when I was extremely honest and said well 3-4 months prior I did pills at my fathers house. My dad is an addict / alcoholic and has been since I was 16. (After the divorce he had he turned to substance abuse) I learned to normalize that behavior . The first time I saw anyone do a line it was him. I was 16 and came home for thanksgiving that week. He snorted it and acted somewhat normal(for him at least) then I just thought it was okay. Well if pops does it and is fine I‚Äôll be okay. Well that transformed into more quickly. I went back to va from ms and began selling spice in school. (k2 when it came out) I got expelled that feb and moved back to MS with my dad immediately to get a GED. I didn‚Äôt do my first pill til that summer and it made all the pain go away mentally and physically. I loved that shit. 100s of pills later and tens years And fast forward to getting kicked out of my fianc√© house . She was shocked when I tested clean and told me if I do a hair test she‚Äôll start to gain my trust again and I jumped at the idea of it but then I call her back and express I was scared because the pills from months before might show up. She expresses how it‚Äôs not the drugs so much as it‚Äôs the lying and trust. I respect her decision and know she was my angel but I have to let her heal . Opiates played such a big role in my life that it sounded normal to say I overdosed even when I was sober.  If you‚Äôre reading this don‚Äôt let pain control you . Fucked up things happen to the best people but don‚Äôt let it run your life it ran mine. Pills can‚Äôt take this pain away but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm at this point. I‚Äôm sober and staying sober .

She has seen me at the lowest parts of my addiction many times. We‚Äôve been together 7 of the 12 years I‚Äôve been addicted to heroin/opiates. As well as frequent binges of alcohol. Last month she had to narcan me 3 times to get me back. She thought I was gone already, they had no idea how long I was out. I‚Äôve been to the same detox facility twice as well as two different stays in residential treatment facilities. They were supposed to each be a month long. I left the first facility two weeks in, I had it in my mind I could do it on my own and that I wouldn‚Äôt ever use again. I died that same month. I went back to a different place, and didn‚Äôt even make it a week before I was kicked out due to a verbal dispute with another client.

I‚Äôm back home now and it has only been two weeks since I overdosed. She‚Äôs scared. But she also has it in her head for some reason that she‚Äôs the main root of my addiction. It‚Äôs the complete opposite though. She is the only driving force keeping me from going all out. She just caught me snorting her suboxone after lying to her twice about not having touched it. I‚Äôm supposed to start the Naltrexone pill in 10 days and then hopefully get the Vivitrol injection soon after if all is well. 

I‚Äôm not sure what is wrong with me. I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy. It‚Äôs not just the anxiety and depression. It isn‚Äôt just the suicidal thoughts and self destructive behaviors. It‚Äôs not just the marital problems and stress of 3 kids. It‚Äôs not just addiction even. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs a mix - I just don‚Äôt want to be sober. Period. I don‚Äôt care what it is, I just want to stop feeling this pain mentally and physically. Of course I prefer opiates though.

Passenger rolls the blunt as we drift into the haze

Melodies from the speakers crash through us like waves

No parents

No rules

No constant interruptions 

No dad telling me that I won‚Äôt ever amount to nothin

‚ÄúLoser!‚Äù is what he yells at me 

As he fills the frame of the door

I already took one pill from you

That line just cost two more

I pop so much you‚Äôd think it was me

That had a hip replacement

Sorry pops I‚Äôm in love with weed

And I fucking love getting wasted

Mom sobs as we release dark forces

She shatters a plate on the counter

Not one of us comes down from our fortress

He throws a blow I always counter

Can‚Äôt turn back from original choices

My boyfriend is an addict but is generally doing OK, and only using a couple times a week (ket). However, anytime he has money come in he ends up on a bender. This week he's been a wreck, he's lost his phone and I've not heard from him for days at a time. Two days in a row he's said he's gonna come see me but then cancelled last minute, literally after he's said he's gonna be over in 30 minutes, because he's high. I don't know how to not get mad. Ive spent the entire week worrying about him and waiting for him, not making any other plans cause I want to see him and then just end up alone and angry. I understand its not ideal for me to get angry at something that he's not doing intentionally, but I have to go through this atleast once a month and I just don't really know how to deal with it.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981186985969543}"

I‚Äôve have reached sobriety multiple times, for weeks, months, and even a year, however have always relapsed. I‚Äôve always taken the path of secrecy, especially with my family urging I keep the situation a secret as not to embarrass the family or sour their or my name/reputation. This approach has always led to relapse as I found myself alone upon reaching sobriety, without much going on and no prospects for future action. This time, I‚Äôm going take advantage of the social world we live in and the technology we have to allow everyone to watch the process, interact with me along the journey, provide support, basically create a community for myself to ensure sobriety, and allow the world a peek into the sad, difficult world of addiction and the real menace, the pain of withdrawal, and sometimes just as painful if not more, the Fear of the pain of withdrawal. 

I will be live streaming, create group chats to stay in touch with everyone, taking suggestions, having conversations, sharing ideas, being there for each other, and I hope all those who follow and join my journey to sobriety and finally overcoming addiction aid in my battle and get to see first hand what it‚Äôs really like, and can help the next person attempting to kick their habit. 

This will be difficult as my culture and family may view this attempt as something bad, as they believe these things should be done in private. I no longer care who says or thinks anything negative about me. I need to save my own life. I don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks of me. I only care about this who support my success and those are the ones that matter. 

So, there‚Äôs my plan. An interactive drug withdrawal experience which brings the addict and the pain suffered during the battle for sobriety to the public light, and allows society to see what it‚Äôs like, better understand addiction, lend a helping hand when possible, and create a support network of simply everyday people who are rooting for the success of the suffering/overcoming addict. Having well trained individuals in the field involved is important and necessary, however sometimes those who are not related to the situation and simply root for the success of a fellow human are those who leave the biggest impact and can mean the most to the suffering addict.

I would love if anyone with ideas or experience would contact me and together brainstorm and share ideas on how to organize, format, and execute the idea in the most effective way possible. Please contact me if you‚Äôre interested in helping, following, or even to make comments. Constructive criticism is encouraged. Please! Help me figure out how to do this correctly, and maybe we may just create for ourselves a blueprint for success. 

I understand medically assisted rehab is currently the most recommended form of rehab, but I want to try a different approach. The people approach. The community approach, where we all come together to help each individual overcome their addictions. 

Im asking you all to help me overcome my addiction, so I can be as great as I am capable of, and In turn continue to help whoever may need someone on their side in this world. 

Let‚Äôs fix the world together.

Contact me for interest, information, basically anything related. 

The idea will basically be me recording most of my days, vlog style, I would love to have a Live feed of my day, things I do, talks I have etc, that would require a team and most likely someone with me at all times. I would love to do this if I find someone interested in volunteering, or a few people volunteering to take turns, as we all do our part in bringing this idea to the world. 

-vlog style
-live stream (potentially constant, 24/7)
-podcast style - group/individual conversations
-therapy
-in person meeting / conversations/activities/etc

This is a fresh idea that I‚Äôm throwing out there, and can potentially make very very simple by ‚Äòvlogging my addiction withdrawal‚Äô and posting daily the progress, but I believe it will start small like that and hope the vision comes to life, and all aspects of the community come to life.

Its 2021. Let‚Äôs beat addiction by eliminating shame, isolation, loneliness and using technology to bring together those who care with those who have no hope, and no one beside them. 

My name is Rashed, and I plan on beating my heroin/fentanyl addiction.

I hope you are around to help me do it.

Let‚Äôs change the world.

Starting with ourselves.

It all started back in September when my friend showed me a musician he found funny. He shows me new songs he finds pretty often and I usually don't like it but this time it was different. The musician in question blew my mind by his humour / the absolute banger that was the song / his unique accent

And it all started from there. Then I discovered all his other songs and I absolutely LOVED all of them. (and i'm usually super difficult when it comes to liking music.

As time went by , I kept falling further and further down the rabbit hole :

listening to all the interviews I could find, reading about him, learning every little thing I could to the point it was basically stalking his personnal life.

 I even started a fan youtube account to archive all his interviews available online / performances/old content ( the guy isn't THAT famous , basically an up and comer from where I live so he even found out about the account..I was ashamed) . 

Then, after a few weeks, it got worse. I discovered that the guy streams a few times a week on twitch. Guess who has watched EVERY SINGLE STREAM since september ? 

Then I discovered he has a discord server where's he's super active with his fanbase.My addiction started to get way worse at this point since I could basically interact with him whenever I wanted.

&#x200B;

So yeah,that's my problem right there. Since september, I only want to listen to his music and nothing else. I watch all his streams even when they last more than 5 hours.i'm.always.there.

All my spare time revolves around him to a certain point.I'm gonna go see him in concert 3 times this spring.

I hate myself for being that addicted. I have to distance myself from all of this. but at the same time.. it gives me so much joy. What have I become ? It's pathetic. 

I promised myself to stop watching his streams from now on. Maybe watch some aftwerwards when he's offline ?

I promised myself to almost never post on his discord anymore and to not meet him when i'll see him in concert this spring.

For his music, i'll keep listening to it as it's not that much of a problem.

I originally wanted to go visit his hometown this summer since it's an absolutely beautiful small town by the ocean. but maybe I shouldn't..

Anyway. One day at a time. Crossing fingers that I can become just a regular casual fan , enjoying his music without getting so emotionaly attached.

Also, this is a throwaway account since I post sometimes about him on reddit and you could easily find who it is,so..

I'm not that deep in addiction that I would be using every day I don't need it and I don't want it cuz getting high day before work is not the best thing to do. Last Sunday I decided that I'll be clean till end of the month and I made this decision because I got drunk and I was driving and I didn't slept for a day and I was falling asleep on a highway and I almost ended up out of the road. I almost died just because I told myself that I'll be clean but I didn't know that I can't drink either I thought I can handle it. But I didn't and because I was really drunk my only thoughts were that I really need to get high. I never felt like this, this was first time that I really 'needed' it. Tbh I wasn't scared that I could die it's just not that big deal but at that moment I realized that my problem is bigger then I thought.
After that I was clean and sober for 6 days but then weekend came again and we were having few drinks with coworkers. I always knew how to drink and I never really got that drunk but that weekend I just wanted to get drunk asf because the whole week without drugs I was just sleeping and I couldn't find motivation to go ti the shower or clean my room. So I did the same thing except for the fact that I don't remember my way to the party where I went and after party I couldn't find my car and when I found it I had a flat tire. That was this Saturday and on Sunday I was like 'Im really gonna stay clean till end of the month.'
But Monday was terrible I wanted to get high so much but I just went to sleep. Tuesday was even worse my work is just pissing me off every day and I even texted my plug but he didn't had time. Yesterday was another terrible day so I just bought 2g of speed just so I can clean my room yk. I wanna get clean but on the other hand I don't wanna. I probably have some mental health issues but I don't have anything diagnosed but I just can't find the motivation for anything. In my job I'm working normally but when I get home it's so hard for me to get up from bed and really do something. So almost every time I need to do something I just do some speed cuz it's easier. I just don't know what to do or I know it but I don't really wanna do it. How do I stay clean and actually function in normal life? Do I need to stay clean for longer time and does it really get better? Because I don't believe in it anymore I was clean for 16 days and I could have been fine but I moved to another country alone and I fell into depression and then started with drugs again.
And one important question: Am I bad just because I don't wanna stop yet?

2022-02-10 10:42:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/sp9ggb/my_story_with_addiction/,My Story with Addiction,"I've just finished watching Dopesick on Disney+ and it hit really close to home for me. The Sackler family behaved in a way that makes me absolutely sick, and watching the series has inspired me to share my story.  

I suffered a knee injury in 2011, aged 16. I went to see my GP who and prescribed Co-Codamol 15/500 and referred me to a physiotherapist. I took the pills for a few weeks and went to my physio appointments to try to strengthen my knee back up. This went on for a while, but unfortunately my knee wasn't feeling any better, even after several months of therapy and several rounds of pain medication. Eventually I was referred to an orthopaedic consultant, who agreed I needed an MRI to see what was going on. The results of the MRI showed that I had torn cartilage in my knee and had also partially torn one of the main ligaments. The consultant suggested the best option for me was to go on the waiting list for surgery, which was around 1-1.5 years long at the time. I was happy to wait, as it had already been a few years of doctors‚Äô appointments, physiotherapy sessions and painkiller prescriptions ‚Äì and I thought the extra wait would be fine. 

During the wait for the surgery, the pain seemed to get worse. I had stopped seeing the physiotherapist, as the consultant now knew that no amount of strengthening would fully ease my pain. However, I found the pain to increase after stopping. I went back to my GP, who was then able to prescribe Co-Codamol 30/500, double the dose I had previously been on, because by that stage I was over 18 years old. 

Quickly I found myself becoming dependent on this medication. They helped my pain, but I can‚Äôt lie - I also enjoyed the way they made me feel. I would finish the prescription within 2 weeks, rather than 4, and top myself up with over-the-counter Co-Codamol, until it was time to get another prescription from my GP. This became a bit of a cycle for me - prescription, OTC, prescription, OTC....and so on. 

I finally got the surgery in 2015 aged 20, yet the pain remained. I kept seeing my GP, who kept prescribing the medication and I kept taking it quite happily. I was extremely depressed during this time of my life. I had gained a lot of weight and I hated the way I looked. The only thing that made me feel good was the buzz I got when I took some type of codeine-based medication. 

Eventually I started buying Dihydrocodeine, a strong codeine-based painkiller, from online pharmacies. I would get into a cycle where I was taking codeine for several weeks and then taking a break for a week or two. In my mind, the fact that I was able to stop for short periods meant I wasn't addicted. 

I told myself that my ability to stop every so often meant that I didn't have a problem for a further 5 years until I completely lost control. 

In March 2020, I found myself catching covid at work. It hit me pretty hard, and I ended up with pneumonia, pleurisy, and countless other chest infections which kept coming back every time I thought I was beginning to recover. The pain across my back from all the inflammation in my chest was agonising, and I took that opportunity to get more painkillers from my GP. They did help, but I had developed quite a high tolerance over the years and their effectiveness quickly diminished. 

I started going back to pharmacies, sometimes up to 4 in one day, buying more and more codeine-based products. I was constantly thinking about which pharmacies I hadn‚Äôt used recently, which I had, and which ones I could use to avoid any suspicion. I would constantly lie about where I was going, just to get some pills. 

I would also use online pharmacies to buy the stronger prescription only medications that I craved. I made accounts with several of these sites, did the health assessments for them all, and happily paid for my prescription to be delivered to my door. This then opened the door for me to start looking for other medications online.

After a month or two of lockdowns and isolation, I found that codeine was no longer enough for me, and I started looking into buying diazepam and other benzodiazepines online. This sent me into a complete downward spiral, as I was buying any pills I could get my hands on, from any sources available. This (most of the time) meant that I was receiving pills from India, which were more than likely completely fake. 

I was also drinking quite heavily during this time ‚Äì an extremely dangerous thing to do when you‚Äôve been taking upwards of 30 pills a day. On one occasion, a friend had to come to my house and almost pull me out of the hot tub. I had taken a handful of pills (a mixture of codeine & benzodiazepines) and then started drinking cocktails for the afternoon. We had been texting throughout, but when I suddenly stopped responding, she naturally became extremely concerned. She arrived to find me almost passed out in the hot tub by myself with a drink in my hand. That was probably one of my lowest points to date. But it wasn‚Äôt enough to stop me.

On another occasion, I remember waking up and finding 4 diazepam remaining in one of the sleeves I had received in the post on the previous day. There were 60 diazepam in total, and only 4 remained. I had taken 56 of them the night before (alongside a lot of alcohol) and had absolutely no recollection of doing so. To this day I still don‚Äôt know if I did this on purpose and that terrifies me. I have overdosed on numerous occasions in the past, but never on purpose. Never for a reason. So to think that I was possibly in a place where I may have purposely overdosed to end my life is one of the scariest thoughts I have. 

By the Summer of 2020, I was just a shell of the person I used to be. My own mother barely recognised me, which is still a painful thought to this day. When I was eventually sat down in July for the final time and told my behaviour needed to stop, I took action. Admitting I had a problem was one of the hardest things I had to do, but I‚Äôm so glad that I did. Up until that point, I had denied any allegations of substance abuse and completely ignored any help or advice that was given to me. This time was different. Things needed to change.

I went back to work and did my best to resist any temptations to go back to my old ways. I stopped benzodiazepines almost immediately, then I worked on giving up the painkillers, then cut down on alcohol a few weeks later. I suppose I was lying to myself at the time about my alcohol consumption too, but I eventually got that under control (one battle at a time, am I right?).

From March-July, I was in a very dark place. I can safely say that I absolutely hit rock bottom and then kept going. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I would have survived if I didn‚Äôt have the family and friends that I do. Everything I did during that time should have pushed them away, but they stuck with me though it all and I‚Äôm extremely grateful to them for essentially saving my life.

As of today, I have been clean of benzos for 581 days and codeine-based pain meds for 568 days. I do still drink alcohol, but I‚Äôm happy with my consumption these days. I had a lot of underlying mental health issues which accelerated my alcohol consumption back then, but these have now been acknowledged and addressed, and I can safely say that I now enjoy a drink in moderation in a social setting only. I don‚Äôt wake up with shame and regret anymore ‚Äì just a content feeling of a night well spent, and I think that‚Äôs something I can really be proud of.",19,"{'covid': 1, 'infect': 1, 'lockdown': 1}","{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9407947063446045}"

2022-02-10 09:23:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/sp7rk9/porn_and_masturbation_addiction_i_loathe_it_with/,"Porn and Masturbation addiction, I loathe it with a passion. If you're interested, heres how I fell into sin of lust and all that disgusting stuff. I didnt get reeled in the typical way Im guessing. Im still battling and falling to this addiction. If porn was a person I would torture and murder them","Apologies if Im awkward with my explanation of this. Never told anyone this before except God. Even though he knew already. You gotta admit to God though yknow what I mean? Ok lets start.

Im a guy btw, currently in highschool.

At around 12 years old my mom took me to a bookstore with my sister who actually needed a book for her english class.
I was browsing too because why not and  I ended up finding a book called ""The Dog Master"". Before this I was watching porn on a kindle fire and I was searching up hot girls on google like a little moron, I wasnt even using incognito, but anyways, I had been doin the stuff for a small while and at this point I had never released my seed in my life. So I got the book and it seemed pretty good, it was one of those acient tribal Native American type stories and I am Native and African American myself so I kept reading. 

      There were some sex scenes throughout the story and just reading that stuff triggered something in me. Previously in nights before I got the book, I had been kinda ""experimenting"" with myself and it felt good and I always wondered at the time what happens when you go further. When I had the book and I read a certain paragraph, I ended up going further with the whole masturbation crap in the bathroom( No I wasnt reading the book in the bathroom btw). 

       It felt really good of course, nobody can deny that, and then BAM I ended up releasing for the first time. I was freaked out. I've had ""the talk"" before kind of but I was still confused at the time. What the hell just came out of me? I cleaned up the mess and didnt tell my parents of course and I realized that all felt super good. I found out it was even better while watching arousing sexual content. And there began my hardcore addiction of porn and masturbation. It originally kinda started with me just googling cute girls and then lust pulled me in hard. I had no self control. I still dont even  now. I do martial arts and track and workout so I feel like I should have the discipline to end it but I just dont. How do I have the willpower to put myself in a freezing cold shower at 7am but I cant keep myself away from ass and titties and beautiful women? Im a Christian and I know through my faith and love towards the Lord I can overcome this addiction but...do I really love the Lord? It is said that those who love the Lord follow his commandments and his law. I fornicate everyday. I sin everyday  and I repent. The cycle continues and I know God is full of mercy thank God. 

     Its so stupid though. I cant stop failing. I try and fail. I try to put away things that will trigger me but I cant. Im on a track team with this  one girl on it and shes  thicc as hell. Not fat thicc just fit thicc. Doesnt help that the girls uniforms seem like they are made to show as much skin as possible. I mean it makes sense though its track. Long sleeve crap and long pants would be dreadful to full sprint in. So, Obviously I dont stare at her like a creep but a single glance and it distracts me and it stays in my mind. That simple sight can lead to a downward spiral of bullcrap. And when we are doing stretches, that is brutal because sometimes shes right in front of me smh. I try to not get any sort of view of that ass cuz then ima go home and be ded.

Another thing, I've constantly been a loner when it comes romantic relationships. Elementary school. Rejected. Middle school. No hope. Highschool. Currently nope. However I dont want a relationship right now. I do but I dont. I mostly dont. I dont feel like dealing with that crap at my age and Im hardly in the mental or spiritual position to be doing it. Plus its not like any girl likes me. Im shorter than most guys my age(not weaker though because I do lots of strength training and martial arts(mma) . I dont know why no girls have ever liked me. I know im not a bad looking guy and Im seriously not that short. Maybe my personality but generally im somewhat goofy,chill, kind, and firm. Idk. 

Ok anyways I say this stuff about relationships because Ive always felt nobody wants me. I have a great father and mother and sisters but they're family. Its no wonder they are attached to me as I am them. 
Masturbation and Porn was and is my only way to receive affection my only theory as to why I want affection so bad is because of inner demon of lust and because I feel like nobody wants me. I know its not true im sure im bound to meet somebody but that wont end my addiction. I need to change my entire lifestyle and center it around God and the development of my mind and spirit. However im not sure if Im strong enough to do that rn. I can try. Fasting might be a good option. Gosh damn this whole addiction is making me a creep and a horny wreck piece of sh#t. When i say piece of sh#t I dont mean im being rude or mean to people. Im very kind generally cuz im not very aggressive with people and my parents raised me that way. What I do mean is that my sleep schedule is screwed, im probably faultering in my athletic ability because of both poor sleep and masturbation. Horrible athleticism killing combo.  Agh its 6am, I got school in an hour and I just had an all nighter now because guess what, porn and masturbation...im never gonna give up trying to quit though. I know its bad to do this stuff and its negatively affecting me so  im never gonna give up. Ima get an hour of sleep now. Thanks for reading if you did. I just needed to get all that crap off my chest at least for a bit. Please pray for me and God Bless you as well.",0,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9373559951782227}"

It seems to have helped me analyze my anxiety inducing thinking patterns which is perhaps beneficial. The negative though is the physical manifestations of my anxiety; the trembling, nervous sweats, shaky voice.

I have found a program that will help me with all of my issues all at once and it looks like a very good opportunity, and it's one that not a lot of people get to experience because again our system is so messed up that people are on a waiting list for years and years. 

How do I tell my mom that I'm going to an addiction centre? I know how my mom is and she is going to be shocked and she is going to worry so much and I'm also afraid of her judgement to be honest. She's a very sweet woman but I just don't know how she will take the news.

I gave up these badboys when I was 30, in that I gave up smoking it all day, every day. But then I was drinking and eating (like a monster) then too - and just very unaware of any of my coping mechanisms, (pre autism & adhd diagnosis & general self discovery on the next level...)

I've curbed it all now, finally, at 33, except I had a bit of an emotional meltdown in November and smoked for a good six weeks, came off after Christmas, then my grandma immediately went into hospital and then died at the end of January, so I kinda just carried on smoking almost constantly and HEAVILY for three months.

I've been smoking these ungodly amounts and have known it was going to really sling me into a bad, bad place when i stopped... and we are here now. I'm done again because I can't do it in moderation, my lungs are absolutely fried before I even manage to get a hit after say the fourth or fifth joint. Its expensive and unsustainable and doesn't align well with my current spiritual values. Weed blew me wide open and changed so much, but that use became abuse and I just needed to move forward.

Anyway what i am really here for is possibly, hopefully reassurance from people who understand.... Addiction is just the hardest thing I've ever, ever, ever dealt with. Trauma as a child, then the double whammy of autism ritual joy and then adhd emotional management and all that comes with that... it makes things utterly impossible to do like a normal person. I don't have any addicty friends these days and am really struggling to speak to someone who gets it....

So now of course I'm totally raw and feeling everything. I slept for 2 days straight, and coming out of that I managed to have a great session on the drums and a big walk, however, I'm on day 3 now I think and I just feel absolutely, absolutely terrible, mentally and emotionally?

I'm functioning and flowing through life like a melancholy ghost but irritable beyond belief, of course all the usual silliness of withdrawal, but then there's the existential dread that is just making me feel like a perpetually short fusing circuit that's about to be sucked into a black hole.

It's clawing away at me through my upper back, I feel panicky, just, this complete existential, awful, terrible, just terrible, terrible feeling....

Smoking will make it all go away but then it will come back worse, so I can't possibly prolong the inevitable any longer... 

Please god, is there anyone out there with some grounding, earthing, reassuring, understanding, motivating words to help me through this. I can't remember how long this lasts... am I going to be okay?? 

Does anyone have any funny, reassuring, kind stories or words or even a lecture...? 

Thank you for reading, everyone,

A very broken me x",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9986913800239563}"

I was buying 2 sugar free Dr. Peppers and a pack of chocolate twinkles to go with my 2 one foot long steak sandwich and loaded french fries. I was going home to gorge myself and then go right to sleep. I love eating big meals then going to sleep. I know it's not healthy, but I do it anyway. I prefer to eat a lot before sleeping. I don't care if it fucks up my body. I don't care if my teeth fall out. I just don't fucking care. Maybe if I told the gas station clerk this, maybe next time I come in she won't ask me to smile. She'll know that I have nothing to smile for. I have no reason to smile. I'm going home to stuff my face with thousands of calories and tons of fat and cholesterol. I never smile. Life isn't something I smile at. People aren't something I smile at. I go through life with a deep dark bottomless expression on my face. No one talks to me and I don't talk to anyone. Just trying to get though this as fast and efficiently as possible. I work nights because of this. You can't see me, and I can't see you. I leave the lights off on my off airport parking shuttle bus until I have to put them on. People get on my bus and start talking about their trip. I shut those fucking lights off. Everyone goes quite. I don't turn the lights on until I reach the off airport parking lot. I hurry around back to get the luggage off before the people get there. I keep my head down and my hood up. I keep my sunglasses on as long as I can. I try to have as little human interaction as humanly possible. Just give me my tip or not and leave. Actually I don't care if I get tip. If I get a tip I feel obligated to talk. To say thank you. At least if you give me nothing, I will have no reason to go further with the interaction. Coworkers want to spark up conversations. I know I can't just not respond. I say the most fucked up off the wall work appropriate shit I can think of. A guy ask me about some pizza place up the street. Asked me why it's never open. Askes me if I've ever been there. I say yeah I've been there to buy heroin. End of conversation. What can he say? He can't even ask if I'm joking because I say it straight face and act dead serious. Younger coworkers ask me questions. I go into a life sucks then you die rant. The only peace is when you die. You die and have no worries. Bills , work, family obligations, society obligations all gone. You just fucking die and thats it. I say this dead seriously with a straight face. Then the deathly silence takes over. Minutes pass and nothing else is said. The young coworkers just sit there and think of a response, but can't think of anything. They know I'm right. They know that there generation is fucked. 20 years old and in college for some bullshit degree. Working at a off airport parking lot for extra beer money. Happy go lucky until I start to talk. It's beautiful. The hopes and dreams are rushed away at a blink of a eye. They realize that I'm right. I walk out of the office to my van in the parking lot. I leave them with there thoughts. I go on another trip to the airport. I drive back and forth over and over again. 10, 11 hours a night. I radio on the cb to the dispatcher. No more glee in their speaking. No more friendly banter or chit-chat. I hear the nothingness in their voice over the radio. I'm not trying to make these people depressed and without hope. It just comes extremely natural to me. Customers are happy they're going on vacation and try to talk to me about it. I hear the happiness in their voices. It's a 10 minutes ride to the airport. 10 minutes is all I need. They get off the bus still happy, but not without wondering. Wondering if that bus driver will still be alive when I get back. Thinking that how can he not be as happy as I am. I'm going vacation, why not spread my joy to everyone I can before I reach my final destination? No. Not on my shift. You're trying to make me feel your excitement is having a negative effect on me. The more you try to talk to me about how happy you are, the more I'm trying to derail you happiness. I drop them off and radio in to dispatch. I hear no happiness or excitement. I give no happiness or excitement. I return to the off airport parking lot. This goes on for the next 9 hours.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982103109359741}"

During the time together she has 'willingly' given him a fairly sizeable portion of her income. She has helped to support him through his drugs issues and has on occasions been assertive with him about not wanting her home turned into a crack den. He had predominantly been smoking crack and they had split due to his not being able to have sex(weak erection, no pre cum, little desire) buy had remained close.

Last night she called to say that he was threatening, out of the blue, to delete her number and return her belongings because of something she had done which he wouldn't elaborate on and that he seemed to be on a crack withdrawal or had taken benzos. When this happens her resolve to help him crumbles and she will buy him a new mobile or replace whatever belonging he has had which he has managed to 'lose' or break (read sell) and/or will self harm and spend  money on him (often well in excess of what she can afford).

This behaviour seems to be cyclical ie. the last time it happened was before their split where he had said he couldn't see a future for the two of them as there had been too many 'problems' and he had lost his taste for the relationship. This resulted in my family memeber self harming in his presence and then purchasing a large quantity of cigarettes and a mobile phone which resulted in him agreeing to remain friends for life.

In recent days he has been threatening to end the friendship and my relative has admitted to trying to stall things by transferring nearly 500 pounds into this guy's account. He has stated that his friendship cannot be bought but appears content to hold onto the money which amounts to nearly 3/4 of a month's wage.

My relative is well versed in addiction and addictive personalities and understands that the drugs have replaced his personality but she is unable to find a way out in part because he is the sweetest most attentive person for weeks on end and then all of a sudden there will be some trivial reason for which he needs to cut her out of his life for good which results in her desperately trying to  buy him back into her life on whatever terms he wants.",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982951283454895}"

And after 1 year of clean time, the cycle slowly began all over again.  


But since the start of 2020.... I have completely lost all control. I use every chance I get. I tell myself, this time, things will change. But every, single, time.... I just loose all self control. Or maybe I never had any to begin with, who knows anymore.

You're born, you live, and no matter what you do or don't do you fucking die. Either you're a disappointment or you dissapoint someone else. No amount of drugs or mental health care could ever fix this problem for me. I already know what's at the end of the light. I can't help myself form thinking logical.

2022-02-08 18:51:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/snyptu/today_i_will_argue_for_12_step_fellowship_recovery/,Today.. I will argue FOR 12 Step Fellowship Recovery,"It's important that I preface this post with this statement:**I do not think that the 12 Step method is the only method to get clean.**It is one of many, many options.I am not a 'big book thumper', (""Big Book"" ie the nickname for the AA book that when followed, act as a guide to recovery. People memorise and quote this constantly.) nor will I zealously defend what a recovery group is - The idea of getting a bunch of untrained, mentally ill people together and attempt to break a severe substance dependence using a 1930s book as an instruction manual.

I also only occasionally attend an AA meeting, I'm actually more involved in CA as it's open to all mind altering substances and different fellowships all seem to have a different vibe. AA can be quite maudlin at times, CA is generally more uplifting and hopeful, NA often devolves into shares about how bad it got for some of them - war stories.

My intention is only to set straight misconceptions and more importantly, misinformation spread by angry people that have had bad experiences.

I completed the 12 Steps after 10 years of rehabs and not staying clean. When I engaged in the program, I managed 2 years clean & sober. My perceptions changed, I had a different outlook, I felt connected and whole - I didn't crave anything and many of my other compulsions quietened down - such as overeating, porn (haven't exposed myself to anything in over 6 years), shopping etc. It really gave me pause before acting and my mental executive functions were restored rather than acting on impulse and instinct and then justifying it later.

I'll attempt to get the main stumbling block out of the way first.. A higher Power

Yes -

It can be done entirely as an atheist. My sponsor was an atheist. The book repeatedly uses the word 'God' and you'll hear people use it in meetings as well. Get over it.. it's just a word and has different implications for virtually anyone you speak to.

The book insists it's a spiritual not religious program. This is true - the word God is there for a few reasons. Simplicity. And if you remove all preconceived ideas (your upbringing or exposure to religion) then you can believe in something bigger than you - I believe that many psychedelic experiences give you a taste of this. By dissolving the ego, the wall around your mind that makes you think you are an individual) you dissolve into the infinite nature of the universe. Despite the 'total abstinence' requirement of being in AA - [the founder himself believed in psychedelic therap](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/aug/23/lsd-help-alcoholics-theory)y that might help people have spiritual experiences and connection to the universe

If you Google things like 'looking for a higher power' there are myriad articles giving you options to explore. Don't let anyone push an idea on you. Which is how many of us felt growing up in a religious household .

At the most fundamental, the simplest thing one could start with is simply - the best version of yourself. How would someone in their right mind, who cared, who wasn't selfish or self seeking be acting.

Well, I wouldn't be lying, stealing, using drugs etc.. Many people feel that once they establish a connection with this so-called higher power, their conscience comes back. They feel the difference between right and wrong and do care more about other people.

Remember, I believe the principles are universal, despite being a book from 1930s - Yes, its very much of its time. However, it does stress that it is a God/Higher Power of YOUR own understanding. You can abandon all of your religious upbringing, brainwashing, the Bible, Christianity, Catholicism.. all of it.. And just believe in a universal consciousness or nature or whatever you damn well please..

I'm going to be going through a video called  [Why 12 Step Programs Are Toxic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzWXw24ZZtY&t=889s) and try to dispel some of the most common grievances with the fellowship, many of which appear in this video.

&#x200B;

\-

&#x200B;

***Point***: It's the only way.. if it doesn't work you're not working hard enough. Anything you do by yourself is equally likely to work as this.

***Rebuttal***: It is absolutely not the only way, it actually says so in the book - it is open to scrutiny from medical professionals or scientific investigation and it holds no monopoly on recovery.

There have been spontaneous recoveries from people that decide they have absolutely had enough and detox themselves and stay clean. However, I believe that there is a sliding scale for addiction.

In the meetings you're like to find people that have underlying mental conditions to deal with as well as addiction. There may be people in the room that simply drink to much and decide to investigate what AA is all about, then leave or cut down by themselves. There is a particular type of addict described in the book - the absolute top end of addiction. You cannot stop, no matter what. You return to it with no thought of consequences and obsess about it when you don't have it. Your thoughts are dominated by that desire, there is virtually no 'normal' thought processes whatsoever, they inevitably lead back to drinking.

Anyone below this level of obsession and mental illness may well find themselves able to recover. I myself have quit smoking, weed and a nasty addiction to GHB - no program, simply stopped. And I was heavily addicted, using all day, every day. However, I still had addictive tendencies and simply switched to other things. I've been in meetings where the subject of alcohol or drugs never came up - people began sharing about their obsessions with shopping or relationships or gambling (my sponsor along with his cocaine problem, was $25,000 in the hole and spent 4 years slowly paying it back).

This program may not work for everyone nor may it even be necessary for some. But for those that deep into the illness - it is designed for them. This accounts for why the success rate is so low. I believe it's 5-8% of people stay sober after the first year. That is terrible. But that also illustrates what a terrible illness this is. Many people need to be absolutely broken - at rock bottom - before they do take on every single suggestion and do what is suggested. Many of those people do recover when they reach that level of desperation.

***Point: Step 1*** \- You must admit you are powerless over your addiction - this is like saying 'lie down and die'

***Rebuttal***: It took me 10 years to accept this. My first rehab I refused to accept I was mentally ill. I was angry that the councillors at that place referred to it as a mental hospital. I've come to accept that this is an accurate definition of my problem. When I'm in active addiction, my decisions make no sense in retrospect and I have got myself into terrible situations. It's insane. If I did to someone else, what I've done to myself I would be charged with attempted murder!

This illness doesn't go away. If it is really a mental illness with brain involvement - issues with dopamine receptors and perhaps low neurotransmitters, and its genetic, often running in families - then I don't see what the issue is of getting this diagnosis. Once I accepted I had it, I began the process of taking responsibility for it.

I tried repeatedly, I couldn't stop myself. Always ending up in the same places I didn't want to be. I hated my life by the end of it. That, to me, is the very definition of powerless. There is a lot of semantic debate over some of the words used in a book nearly 100 years old. I think we should get over that and try to accept the principle of what is being said rather than obsess about the wording.

&#x200B;

***Step 2 - Only 'GOD' can save you and I don't see him as very active in peoples lives - he doesn't talk back***

***Rebuttal***: The issue here is that God has been personified. We've already been through the simplicity of what it could be and to reject any idea that doesn't fit your version. I personally believe that this may even just be a psychological trick - in shrinking the ego to allow for the possibility of connection with the universe (see: Psychedelic effects) it begins to reduce the chatter inside the head and feel more open. I remember this along with step 3 - I began to feel like I was inside something (the universe) instead of just a body with a head that wouldn't shut up, obsessing. However it worked, I didn't need to question it - if I feel a change, that's good enough for me.

This may be really 'out there' in terms of ideas. But there is a subreddit about '[Tulpas](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/)' - imaginary beings that you will into existence and they begin to speak back to you. Sounds like induced mental illness and schizophrenia to be honest! But let's say there is a part of the brain that can imagine something outside yourself - and you being to active it. Whether it's real or not, using that part of the brain seems to bring about psychological benefits - or you could just believe that it is the spirit of the universe you're plugging in to.

I'm sure each experience of becoming more open minded to an idea that the world doesn't revolve around you is unique. I'm not here to say what happens, I'm saying that it can be done and it seems to have positive effects. Whether you engage in cultivating the idea or you simply acknowledge something bigger than you (I rarely sat down while I was high and contemplated the immense complexity of an infinite universe. Creator or not - consciousness from the arrangement of matter is baffling and scientifically unsolvable in my opinion. Is there a quantum field of consciousness everywhere that the brain tunes into due to its arrangement. Many reputable scientific journals are allowing more papers desperate not to venture into woo-woo land, but are hinting at [panpsychism](https://aeon.co/ideas/panpsychism-is-crazy-but-its-also-most-probably-true).

TL;DR It's complicated.. almost certainly nobody has the right idea, but tapping into the belief in whatever it is seems to affect our ability to break addictive thought loops and allow pause in order to reevaluate our decision making process. A better version of me wouldn't do this..

***Point: Prayer is Magical Thinking***

***Rebuttal***:  Semantic debate. Would 'mantra' suit better? And the sustained practice of magical thinking has an effect in the brain. Sponsors tell you to pray on your resentments against people, attempting compassion and kindness instead. I don't know what sort of sponsors people get, but they should not be telling you to manifest money in your life or material goods. It should be about removing your issues, keeping a clear head through the day, making sure you stay on the right path. 

Simply - if I repeat this idea in my head, I'm more likely to accomplish it.

  
There is an incredible book called '[Altered Traits](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Altered-Traits-Science-Reveals-Meditation/dp/0399184384)'  all about meditation. No new age bullshit. No hippy stuff. Pure science. Including MRI scans of long term meditators and monks showing structural brain changes. 

The effect on the brain can all be measured. [Here is a list of the MANY types of Buddhist meditation.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zkdbcj6/revision/3) One practice, known as loving kindness, karuna or compassion -    


""Being compassionate is part of a Buddhist‚Äôs spiritual path, and they attempt to show compassion for everyone in the world who is suffering. Buddhists accept that there is suffering in the world. Karuna teaches that a Buddhist should care for others even though they are also attempting to overcome their own suffering.""  


Placed in a brain scanner - a monk with many years of meditation and mantra (prayer) practice was able to activate at will, the part of the brain responsible for compassion and care.  


Prayer doesn't have to have the ridiculous connotations of everyone in a church bowing down and worshipping the invisible sky daddy. But if you see it as the practice of gratitude and giving thanks, that's a fantastic thing to practice so that you can choose to feel those emotions more frequently than the obsession to change how you feel through chemical means.

2022-02-08 17:18:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/snwksk/i_think_i_might_be_an_addict_and_i_need_help/,I think I might be an addict and I need help,"For background information, I‚Äôm a 19-year-old girl who‚Äôs diagnosed with ADD (same thing as ADHD minus the hyperactivity). I‚Äôve been taking prescription Adderall since I was about 12 years old. Mind you, despite how over-prescribed Adderall supposedly is, it was something I definitely needed at the time. I had a traumatic event happen to me as a child involving my father (who was addicted to painkillers and alcohol), and I believe the trauma has something to do with my ADD because I started showing symptoms shortly afterwards, though I didn‚Äôt get medicated for it until years later. Also, I got diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety as a direct result of the trauma.

I know Adderall is a controlled substance that can lead to addiction, which is why I‚Äôm seeking answers about this. I can‚Äôt tell if what I‚Äôm going through is an addiction or not. Let me explain:

After being prescribed Adderall at age 12, I took it normally and consistently (once a day throughout the 5-day school week). I had a much easier time focusing in class and my grades improved significantly. This was the case up until I was about 15 years old, when my doctor suggested that I start taking Adderall twice a day (once in the morning, once in the evening). I started to realize how much I liked the way Adderall made me feel. Whenever I took it, it made me feel like I was capable of doing anything I put my mind to. I‚Äôd pull all nighters and spend the entire night sketching, writing, or doing anything productive, all while I popped more pills than I was supposed to take. There were times where I‚Äôd take 5 pills a day. At that point, I was also at the peak of my eating disorder (anorexia nervosa), and frequently I‚Äôd take Adderall just to get rid of my appetite. It made me lose a lot of weight.

The reason why I‚Äôm not sure if this is an addiction is because when I eventually had to stop taking it so often, I couldn‚Äôt tell whether my symptoms were from withdrawal or simply normal side effects of coming down from the medication. After spending so many days and nights on it, spending a day without it was just‚Ä¶exhausting. I‚Äôd be fatigued, irritable, and sometimes feel physically ill the entire day. There was a time where I binged on Adderall for nearly 48 hours, then I finally went to sleep around 3 a.m., and woke up at 8 p.m. later that same day. That long crash was most likely due to how sleep deprived I was in general, but I‚Äôve crashed for extensive periods after taking Adderall when I wasn‚Äôt necessarily sleep deprived before.

Another thing that convinces me that this might be an addiction is already having an addictive personality, and being predisposed to addiction due to how much it runs in my family, including my father. This is what worries me the most.

Would anybody be able to tell me if it sounds like I‚Äôm addicted to Adderall or not? I realize it probably sounds like a stupid question, but drug addiction is very serious and I want to make sure I‚Äôm not blowing it out of proportion before I reach out for help. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to be honest, this is something I really want to know so I can figure out how to approach it when I talk to my loved ones about it.",12,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9948752522468567}"

Anytime I‚Äôve used drugs I‚Äôve gotten hooked and wanted to do them always. I find I can‚Äôt even start smoking weed or else it quickly becomes a daily thing that I rely on. I have friends who‚Äôve done more addictive chemicals but they don‚Äôt respond to them in the same way I do. I get hooked on ideas and can‚Äôt stop thinking about them. Right now it‚Äôs drugs, in particular Adderall (not prescribed), shrooms, and nicotine. I want to try others but my addictive tendencies have shown that when I introduce a new compound into my life it feels like it‚Äôs just one extra thing I have to work to not abuse. 

Even just nicotine I‚Äôve watched my friends casually vape which I took too far and felt like my lungs were giving out everyday so I switched to pouches and Nicorette mints. What I deem addictive tendencies become apparent when I purposefully use drugs like nicotine and Adderall when I have no food in my system just to maximize the dopamine rush. I also crush up the Nicorettes into powder because I want it to get absorbed as quickly as possible to feel something. I love bingeing and once I start I can‚Äôt stop. Is this just the nature of being 22 years old? Do I need to engage more work than others to steer clear from substances? My father is an alcoholic and I see a lot of myself in him. We both have ‚Äúticks‚Äù that we have never been able to kick like head picking and mouth biting. I found I always take it too far though. My dad just bites the inside of his mouth like he would biting his nails but I do it in a way where I hunt for the most painful parts and bite there and then my mouth is full of blood. And I can‚Äôt stop when I start. 

All this to say, I feel shameful about my addictions to things that feel normal to others. I have an insane job in tech and a degree and work in the creative industry and I see so many people using Adderall and nicotine and caffeine and other substances unhealthily just to make a name for themselves and as a workaholic artist having unhealthy addictions almost makes it feel like I‚Äôm living the part. I don‚Äôt even know if I want to quit. I‚Äôm really curious about other drugs like MDMA and painkillers but I‚Äôm scared they‚Äôd really ruin me. Most of my friends are very straight edge so I feel alien when I talk about drugs which is a good thing I suppose that theres no external pressure to participate. I‚Äôm super stressed these days and in the dumps emotionally and it feels like I‚Äôm always just waiting for the next time I use a pouch or take shrooms or Adderall to make days less boring.

Juuling is the only bad addiction that I have left and I figured I'd been sober long enough to kick the habit and, after all, I'd quit mf drugs so what's a little alpine berry juul pod got on me? Well a lot more than I thought tbh. It's kinda pathetic when I say it out loud, I was 9 days free before I caved in and bought another pack. The withdrawals weren't even that bad (I gained some weight from eating too much but that's nothing) so why did I go back? And I'm doing it in secret, like hiding it from my loved ones because I told them I quit and they're all being super supportive and put up with my irritability for the first week but now I'm vaping alone in my room like I would do with drugs a year ago.

There are tons of people across the globe that smoke or snort heroin. While some inject the same in their veins which is eventually a more dangerous way for taking this illicit drug! Honestly, whether you snort, smoke, or inject, heroin can quickly get to your nervous system. Apart from this, it is easy to overdose and gets depended on no matter if you have used it once or twice. 

There are plenty of reasons why heroin is illegal. Heroin is known for numbing your body from experiencing pain, it slows down your heart rate, and when misused, there are possible chances of getting cardiac arrest. These days, tons of adults have started using Heroin to get rid of anxiety attacks, stresses, and plenty of other things such as experiencing euphoria, etc. 

**Why Heroin Use Is Getting Doubled Day By Day?**

According to different surveys, the numbers of heroin users in the United States have increased rigorously since 2007. One of the major reasons for the hefty rise is- the doubling misuse of prescribed opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, etc made from the poppy plant and are chemically similar to heroin. Individuals who abuse heroin and other illicit drugs might begin looking for cheaper as well as stronger high, and what is concerning here is- Heroin provides both! Not only this, in comparison to other drugs, heroin is more fatal! Because there is no scope of knowing what amount you are taking and how powerful it is!

The death rate rose to nearly 400% in the U.S. in between 2010 to 2017. Moreover, some demises took place as heroin was amalgamated with another powerful painkiller like fentanyl.  

**What Are the Short and Long Term Impact of Heroin?**

**Short-term effects of heroin include:**

¬∑ Euphoria

¬∑ A dry mouth

¬∑ Warm, flushed skin

¬∑ Arms and legs that feel heavy

¬∑ Upset stomach and vomiting

¬∑ Itching

¬∑ A fuzzy brain

¬∑ Switching in and out of drowsiness (this is often called being ‚Äúon the nod‚Äù)

**Long-term heroin use can cause:**

¬∑ Lung diseases like Collapsed veins

¬∑ Insomnia

¬∑ Infections of your heart lining and valves

¬∑ Skin infections like abscesses  

¬∑ A higher chance of getting HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C

¬∑ Liver and kidney disease

¬∑ Mental disorders

¬∑ pneumonia and tuberculosis

¬∑ Menstrual problems and miscarriage

**Heroin Addiction Treatment**

On the off chance, if you have gotten addicted to heroin and want to get rid, the only way is to seek help at [Rehab centers](http://clearskyetreatmentcenters.com/heroin-addiction-treatment/) (Heroin addiction treatment facilities). At rehab, a team of specialists will help you find the right heroin addiction treatment plan that will suit you. The plan will probably incorporate medication and behavioral therapy. Experts say this medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù of care for people who have a heroin addiction.

The stigma is bullshit. Yes, there are piece of shit addicts‚Ä¶ like there are piece of shit non-addicts. Similar rates in both groups if I had to make an educated guess. I‚Äôm a little biased FOR addicts because I‚Äôve met some of the best people I‚Äôve ever known who happen to also be daily drug users. If they started out with a solid view of the world and some empathy and decent work ethic‚Ä¶ they usually became a fucking cool addict. 

Maybe there‚Äôs more to it than that.. but all I know is some people do well in addiction. Hence why you don‚Äôt hear about their story‚Ä¶ *they don‚Äôt have horror stories to tell.* They don‚Äôt plead for help to achieve sobriety online (no judgment if you have, though). They don‚Äôt go to N/A meetings. They don‚Äôt have long heart felt posts about how difficult quitting and maintaining sobriety is.


They look and act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to society‚Äôs standards. They don‚Äôt tell everyone (like I do lol) because they realize it‚Äôs their own life and they are the only judge that matters concerning that. They function well and they don‚Äôt raise too much suspicion. They also learned the lesson about society and it‚Äôs standards/opinions being irrelevant and actually very counterproductive to achieving happiness. It‚Äôs an imagined concept that has no real substance to it. It‚Äôs bullshit. It doesn‚Äôt actually matter in the grand scheme of things. Period. This needs to be accepted by the addict to really rid themselves of the misplaced and imagined guilt/shame forced upon them by others


I hope to help uplift other likeminded addicts and also to do my part to chip away at the unfair and cruel stigma associated with meth use in particular. I feel the heat from society every single day. 


**There is not a day go by that I don‚Äôt feel judged harshly or see other addicts treated the same way ie: called ugly, gross, with fake people pretending to be worried about my well being but actually don‚Äôt give a shit, told I‚Äôm a fuck up, I‚Äôve lost every friend I had, then there‚Äôs the ‚Äúmeth head haters club‚Äù They find it to be funny to go talk shit to addicts‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs weird. it‚Äôs also hurtful sometimes. and I‚Äôm betting other users feel the same way.


# How
I truly believe that an addict has the absolute best chance at sobriety if happiness/self love/inner peace/past trauma addressed/healed happens first. This whole ‚Äúyou must hit rock bottom‚Äù thing is 4 the birds. You know what else happens at rock bottom sometimes? Suicide. Or complete self destruction. The unfixable ruin of entire families. Etc‚Ä¶. Amazing things can come from rock bottom as well.. but why take that chance? Why would you want to be forced to rock bottom or be awaiting rock bottom before you try for your sobriety and then AFTER that you are supposed to heal yourself and past traumas‚Ä¶ find self love‚Ä¶ etc? I don‚Äôt fucking think so. That sounds like a one way ticket back to addiction to me. Actually it has been my ticket back to addiction before. And I‚Äôve seen it be other‚Äôs tickets as well.


# Just My Opinion
I don‚Äôt want to seem like I‚Äôve got it all figured out because I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm currently still an addict so take that for what you will. I have spent so much time and energy towards hypothesizing and researching and contemplating and soul searching  on other ways to achieve the ultimate goal. This is my current ‚Äúbest way‚Äù I believe it can be done and be sustainable for the rest of your life. This is how I did it (unknowingly really) when I quit opiates/suboxen. I truly have no cravings or left over problems from that addiction. It was easy to quit with the right mindset and a little luck‚Ä¶ and a friend or 2 to help uplift you when you feel like you aren‚Äôt so sure you can do it.


# Embrace Who You Are, The Rest Falls Into Place
**Step 1:** embrace your addiction and who you are while you are an addict in this exact moment. Post fucking cloud videos if you want to. Have freak nasty sex. Get tweaky on cleaning the house. Idfk, there are numerous cool tweaker activities‚Ä¶ pick your favorite, do it unapologetically, and continue to remind yourself that you WILL learn to love who you are, darkness and all. Especially your darkness. Because at first you won‚Äôt believe it‚Ä¶ but when you start seeing that your life gets substantially easier once you take this step‚Ä¶ you begin to love yourself for being courageous enough to stick with it when most of the world is unable to be their real self, you persevered. It‚Äôs a fucking cool and useful tool for your life‚Äôs toolbox‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a tool that you need. Get the fucking tool. Lol. I know at least like 20 people on here that will accept you for whatever the fuck you are. So you aren‚Äôt alone. 


**Step 2:** for the love of GOD‚Ä¶ 

Stop. Talking. Shit. About. The. Dope. 

Have. Respect. For. It. Or. It. Will. Ruin. Your. Life. Amen. 


We ‚ù§Ô∏è drugs here‚Ä¶ we are addicts after all. Idc if every single person you know literally looks at you sideways for this one‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs super fucking important and is non negotiable. Just believe me and go with it for now if you don‚Äôt understand it. It‚Äôs a must, for real.


**Step 3:** work on getting yourself on a more healthy schedule with the help of the built up momentum of beginning to find self love and with the hopeful support you‚Äôve started to receive. I realize that it takes some momentum before you can really commit and tackle getting yourself on a schedule and not just self sabotaging all efforts. You must do step 1 and 2 first to be able to do step 3 and it be sustainable, most likely.


**Step 4:** now that you are closer to self love.. and you are on a much more healthy schedule that you‚Äôve stuck to long enough to feel some comfort and familiarity in it, this is where it‚Äôs up to you. YOU and only YOU know when you are ready. Don‚Äôt treat sobriety or your attempts like they don‚Äôt matter overall‚Ä¶ you lose momentum and confidence each time you try that cycle and you fail.


Personally, I wish to tackle it once and once be it. I don‚Äôt want to have to think about the last time it didn‚Äôt work out when I go to attempt it all again. So take it seriously‚Ä¶ make sure you‚Äôve truly found self love in it‚Äôs entirety or as close to it as possible for you. Make sure your vibes are high. Make amends with anyone you may have wronged in your time as an addict. Feel goo:d‚Ä¶ look good‚Ä¶ and treat people and yourself good. Surround yourself with friends/family who are nothing but completely understanding and supportive of your way of going about this. You can‚Äôt have negativity and low vibing people around you during this‚Ä¶ for real. Find your true supporters. They will help you. And do whatever it takes to get in the mindset of ‚Äúliving in the moment‚Äù and also realizing that life just ain‚Äôt that fucking serious‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. we all make it out to be in our heads‚Ä¶ but take a step back and look at what life is. YOU decide that. It‚Äôs YOUR life. 


Do you want an anxiety and depression inducing life or do you want one you freely float through with no crazy attachments to anything in particular? Just here to enjoy the ride‚Ä¶. It puts addiction in a perspective that is really helpful in my opinion. YOU decide if this will be easy or hard. YOU decide if you maintain your sobriety. Quit giving away your power. It‚Äôs all you‚Äôve fucking got. And hopefully with your self love and support all around you‚Ä¶ you feel the most powerful that you‚Äôve ever felt and you RESPECTFULLY lay the needle or pipe or bong down‚Ä¶. You thank the drug for the cool ass experiences you‚Äôve gotten to have while on it‚Ä¶ you thank it for getting you through the tough time in your life that you felt you needed to be high in order to cope‚Ä¶ you say goodbye and you get to have fond memories of the methtivities you did. They are funny ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and cool and fun. I‚Äôm just sayin.  Psychosis episodes might even start to be a lil funny to you at this point‚Ä¶ tell some psychosis stories to your support system. Lol. It‚Äôs not that serious. For real. Addiction is only so powerful and intimidating because you‚Äôve been brainwashed to believe that way by every single person you‚Äôve ever known and society as a whole. But you get to decide what it really is‚Ä¶ fuck everyone else.


And that‚Äôs how you tackle addiction and maintain sobriety for the rest of your life if YOU choose to. (In my opinion of course‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve not really tested it out on the masses, just personal experience). I hope like hell this might help some people. I‚Äôm going through the process myself and practicing what I preach and just trying different ways of believing and seeing this piece of my life


I‚Äôll repeat what I believe to be the most important part of this:

**Do not disrespect the dope** 
ie: talk shit about yourself or others for being on it,  or talk shit about it being ‚Äúthe devil‚Äù or other similar phrases. it‚Äôs immature and misplaces blame. It‚Äôs not helpful. It‚Äôs negativity. It‚Äôs making those struggling with sobriety or those that recently relapsed feel like absolute trash. Not ideal. Not cool. I‚Äôm all about embracing your true self and loving that person and loving the drugs that person needed in order to cope with life for whatever reason. We respect the dope here. It‚Äôs the best lesson my dad ever taught me and it‚Äôs probably the main point behind my whole idea. If I didn‚Äôt believe it to be important as hell, I might have never come to any of these conclusions.",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9866118431091309}"

I also have a similar habit, where instead of squinting both eyes, I close just my left eye when smoking...

I never really had any habits when I used to smoke weed, and weed was my main drug of choice, beginning at 14 and smoking for 10 years... Only habit I really had with weed is that if I get paranoid when I'm stoned, I'll always eat something, and whether it genuinely helped or was just psychological, this would always stop my paranoia

The only other sort of habit I had when smoking weed was that I'd always go for a late night drive around 1-3am, listening to music and also star gazing and sky watching, looking for UFOs..

The common belief is that ‚Äú drugs are the cause of addiction‚Äù. That‚Äôs just not true. Drugs are a symptom of addiction, but not the cause. Addiction starts long before drugs are introduced. Most addicts have been seeking some form of dopamine and seratonin rush since a child (sex, food, video games, excercize). 

So why can normal people drink with moderation or do coke once a year and not think about it again, while addicts ruin their lives with them? Because of the chemical imbalance and brain disease an addict has dealing with pleasure. 9/10 addicts use to self medicate.

I'm 21 yo. I have been addicted to porn since i was 13. It took me 7 long years to realize what this addiction has done to my life. 

I have been trying to quit this addiction of PMO (Porn masturbation and orgasm)  for like 2 years but i keep failing. 

The ""Trying to quit"" period made it even more worse by not being able to focus on anything which resulted in the following - 

1- Went from 0 to 15 failed exams in college. 

2- Freelance career ruined due to my inability to committ towards any tasks consistently. 

3- Depression and suicidal tendancy out of regret of not being able to quit. 

4- My startup still remains a dream due to lack of funds. 

5- I left my Girlfriend cause i couldn't deal with her drama along with all these existing problems. 

6- I don't have any friends nearby. My college is in another state and I live with my parents who are emotionally abusive. 

7- Social life ruined. 

Extra - I have had a horrible childhood. Toxic father and being bullied at school with no friends were few of it. I was also mocked for my physical condition at school which resulted in my low self esteem. (I have seizures and stuff) 

Basically I'm getting used to feeling like shit every time i relapse. For those who are about to advise tips on quitting, don't. 

I have tried everything there is to quit, but like any hardcore addict, staying at home idle triggers the dopamine needs which fuels the urge to relapse. 

So currently i plan to hit the gym and be busy with activities at college as much as possible. The goal is to never stay idle. 

But at the moment, I'm stuck at home with this toxic habit and feeling suicidal and depressed both at the same time. 

I don't need any advice. I'm aware of the ways to get out this loop of suffering. I'm just not in a situation to act accordingly.

My question is, if you have this kind of ""addictive personality"" (i.e. mental illness, OCD in my case).....what does recovery even look like??? I find it impossible to conceptualize a future where I dont have an unhealthy underlying NEED for something. Whether its weed, a relationship, sugar, sex, attention, etc. If I gave up all of this to be healthier and focus on myself.....id probably develop one of my hobbies to an addictive, unhealthy degree, like my partially-recovered alcoholic dad has done with running/working out. 

To be clear, I am currently medicated for OCD and it definitly helps, but I find it hard to believe any combination of therapy and drugs will ever solve my addictive tendencies. Is there hope? Is there a point in recovery where you wake up and realize ""Hey, I dont feel an unhealthy desire for anything/anyone.

My mind is clear and focused. My emotions are balancing out. My stress levels are the lowest they‚Äôve been in years. Oddly enough, I had an intense using dream last night, which I guess is my mind‚Äôs way of saying ‚Äúnot so fast‚Äù as the curtain of addiction continues to lift. It‚Äôs been 15 years of this shit, man. I‚Äôve made countless attempts at sobriety, ranging from a couple hours to 14 months, and I‚Äôve never wanted so badly to make substance use part of my past. I got clean this time because I was once again losing my grip on reality. I was hearing voices. I was broke. I was bottoming out. My days as a functioning addict were over.

Something I‚Äôve been thinking about a lot lately is the idea of psychological addiction. I‚Äôve never had much in the way of physical withdrawals. Opiates were never my cup of tea. My most recent cycle was daily marijuana use followed by two to three day Adderall binges. Wax on, wax off. But any addictive substance, even something as comparatively harmless of marijuana, produces physical changes in neurotransmission. The brain makes a maladaptive adjustment to substance use, etching it into daily life. I fell into this cycle originally because I completely misunderstood that concept. Addiction is not what I thought it was. It is so much worse. It takes over the mind. It robs you of the essential you, and you‚Äôre the last one to know it. There‚Äôs nothing I want more than than to pass this knowledge onto the younger generation, people like myself who have no idea that they‚Äôre getting themselves into something truly terrible, but at the same time I consider it to be a fool‚Äôs errand. Would I have listened when the drugs were a novel and truly exhilarating experience? I don‚Äôt think so.

The first time I consciously tried to get clean was over ten years ago. During this repeated cycle of recovery and relapse, I‚Äôve lost so many friends. My best friend didn‚Äôt invite me to his wedding. There was never a falling out. People simply distanced themselves from me. I‚Äôm a liability. I‚Äôve missed out on so much. Some days I feel nothing but regret. Other days I make peace by reminding myself I‚Äôm a more humble, more caring, and more understanding person because of the havoc addiction has inflicted on my life. I intimately understand failure. I know what it‚Äôs like to be objectively in the wrong. I‚Äôve done some truly awful things that keep me up nights. My sober mind struggles to reconcile my actions in active addiction, and if I‚Äôm not careful that alone will make me relapse. There are so many triggers, so many trauma points, that sometimes I just want to scream. Or drive 100 mph into a brick wall, ending this struggle for my sanity altogether. Or get high. This week I feel great. A week ago I was at my wit‚Äôs end. That‚Äôs just how it goes.

Yesterday I visited my dad‚Äôs farm. Here in Ohio we‚Äôve taken so much snow in the past couple days that I haven‚Äôt been able to work. I drive for UberEats, but I have a RWD vehicle. It handles well in the snow, but it‚Äôs prone to getting stuck when we get dumped on. Boredom is my worst enemy. I was so restless that I made the half hour journey to see my pops and the animals. Really I just wanted to play with the new puppy. We scurried around in the snow. The pup, me, and the adult dog of the same breed. My heart was filled with so much love and joy. I wasn‚Äôt concerned about my reup. I wasn‚Äôt in a rush to get home to my bong. I wasn‚Äôt frantic because I‚Äôd spent all my disposable income and then some ($400+/month on weed alone). I was truly in the moment, staying for dinner and chatting with my dad and his wife into the late night. I thought about how free I felt, how substances no longer run my life, and it‚Äôs enough to bring grown man to tears. Addiction is a nightmare. I don‚Äôt think you understand that until you break the cycle. Like what the fuck was I doing? That‚Äôs not life. This is.

My girlfriend and I sent messages back and forth when I got home. I slipped off to sleep with ease. Yet it was a night of using dreams. A day of recovery punctuated by the invisible hand trying to yank back into that lifestyle, the sickening fond memories of highs long gone, a reminder that I will live with this hideous affliction the rest of my life. Someone tell my 16 year old self that the drugs aren‚Äôt worth it. I‚Äôm 31, and I‚Äôm just now beginning to live.",7,{'transmission': 1},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9737600684165955}"

So little background, I‚Äôm a 24 year old 5th year medical student in a different country from my home country and I haven‚Äôt been back home in 5 years so that should tell you about how my relationship is with my family, my parents are separated and you could tell they hate each other everytime they are together so I didn‚Äôt have the best childhood, my dad worked for an oil company and got alot of money but retired 8 years ago , the money is still there a bit and he‚Äôs a politician  and he is a very frugal man so this would put things into perspective.

On October 2021 I was sent 5000$ which is equivalent to 2 million in my country currency for my feeding for a year and my house rent and bills, and my dad had a conference in Russia in February 2022 and thought I could use the money to secure him some accommodation too.

My history of gambling-I‚Äôve been gambling since 2014 but it‚Äôs kinda been on and off but since 2021 due to lockdown I got too invested because I came across one gambling page on twitter which lead to 15 others, that‚Äôs when I started gambling with what little funds I had and managing the losses, then came October when I got the 5000$ , I started of slowly but dug my self into a big hole left with 1600$ on January, I decided to make a big gamble which I won which turn the 1600$ back to 4500$, any sensible person would have ran right? But no I kept gambling on soccer and basketball games, I couldn‚Äôt go a day without betting and having online classes means I was stuck that home spending 12 hours a day on stats and betting websites,
Little by little I lost everything again, I tried another big bet but it didn‚Äôt work this time till I was left with nothing in my account,

Then I sold my iPhone to a friend and thought maybe if I‚Äôm more careful this time I won‚Äôt lose it but I also lost everything.
 
I feel like I wanted to fuck my life, I still don‚Äôt understand how all this happened, I lost everything in 5 months, now I have nothing, no money, no hope, I opened up to my roommates today about my situation and how I‚Äôm  suicidal and they were understanding, agreed to cover me for this month 

I don‚Äôt know where to start from because I‚Äôm a medical student and literally have classes every day and I don‚Äôt have a job,

I‚Äôm ready to face the consequences , i have to tell my parents, my relationship with my dad is strained already after I failed 2nd year of medical school in my country which cost a lot of money,so this would probably destroy it, he has already paid all my school fees so he probably would disown me, this would break my mom‚Äôs fragile heart, the woman loves me, one of the reason why I haven‚Äôt taken my life, my siblings would be disappointed and never look at me the same way, I ruined everything , I‚Äôve been thinking of lying about losing the money to crypto which is less disgraceful than gambling because I‚Äôm African and gambling is frowned upon but I don‚Äôt want to lie, I want the truth out to be done with it


Do I regret it? yes, I can‚Äôt sleep or be awake without thinking about it, the worst part is I had really long dreads but I cut it last week out of frustration, felt like a punishment for me, I needed but still isn‚Äôt enough

I(28) have been in a relationship with my partner(34) for about three years.
When I met her, I was in a really bad state of mind, and I was coping with weed(once a day before bed) and beer, also in the evening.
After a few months of this constant cycle, I realized that my head is a jelly every night, and that I don't want or like living that way. I stopped using both, and havent even had a day of regrat or some kind of craving.

But my partner is another story. I feel like she ""has"" to smoke weed everynight, usualy two joints. I tried talking to her about this, but she is conviced that she has got no problem, since she is smoking just after work to get sleepy.
Sometimes when we go out, she likes doing speed,and when I confront her about it, she says that it's just for fun and that I am being too serious about life.
She has been doing this for many years(a lot of weed and occasionaly the other stuff).

I am pretty sure that my views of life are okay, unfortunately I am no saint but I can recognize when I am doing something that is bad for me, and I have balls to stop doing that. I believe there is no fun in drugs. We all know what comes the day after, right.

I would appreciate a more objective view on things. Am I being prude, or am I seeing the situation as it is?
I love this person, and I can see that she does this stuff because off deep insecurity and dissatisfaction. I just want to find the right approach to help.

She has resumed taking Xanax this pass week responsibly and believes because her drug of choice is Percocet, she is merely treating her anxiety.  Drug abuse is a huge trigger for me because of my childhood and my own battle with drugs & alcohol.  She is currently is living with me and Georgia and I want her gone.   I cannot even have a conversation with her because she is either gets extremely aggressive or extremely defensive. She‚Äôs threatening suicide now smh. I‚Äôve dealt with addicts my whole life, but she is on a different level. I‚Äôm done being captain save a hoe. She needs to go, but she won‚Äôt. Idk what to do, please advise.

**Queue the Juicy Drama**
Growing up, both of my parents were recovering addicts. My father has never relapsed in my life, but my mother did periodically.  It caused me to have extreme issues surrounding addiction. It triggers anger, abandonment, and hurt from deeply within me. When I was younger it triggered curiosity; I experimented with various drugs, but I never got into full blown addiction with anything other than alcohol and cigarettes. I will actually be 200 days sober from alcohol tomorrow and it‚Äôs been 67 days since I‚Äôve had a cigarette.  I‚Äôm in therapy and I‚Äôve discovered so many triggers I never realized I had, this is one.  

I‚Äôve save the stories, but I‚Äôve dealt with addicts my whole life and my HIGHdar is very accurate lol. I don‚Äôt look for it, it just reveals itself to me. I have friends who were victims of child molestation and can pinpoint predatory behavior immediately, it reminds me of that.e

I moved myself and my parents to Georgia in 2020. My younger sister (24) lived with them at the time, but it was super unhealthy for my mom because she was lying and not paying her bills.  She was running a business that eventually turned into her scamming people and my mom paying them back. Here‚Äôs the thing, she was pretending to have drop shipping issues and lying to my mom that she would sell the items when they arrived and pay her back. This should‚Äôve been a red flag to my mom, but she doesn‚Äôt notice drug addiction immediately. Nonetheless it started to become more obvious, but she lies so much that it didn‚Äôt seem severe.

When we moved to GA, my sister was forced to go out on her own. It lasted a couple of months before she was evicted because her boyfriend was giving her the rent money and she was getting high.  As a result, she ended up with us in GA. I said no, my Mom was conflicted, I gave in for her.  This is one of my biggest regrets.

She did good for awhile, but on her second visit back home she spiraled and a week trip turned into a few month binge. She was boosting clothes, soap, whatever- everyday with our addict cousin to get high. She kept lying to us about what was going on, but I told my mom it was more to it. None of our family there wanted to be bothered. She went to one of our sister‚Äôs jobs (they have a small thrift store) and introduced herself as her sister before proceeding to steal MANNEQUINS. Wtf?! It was all on camera and she still denied it. Finally, I drove to Maryland to retrieve her (why tf did I do that?!).

Summer rolls around she has friends visit. She was using with them. Thing is, she had no income so when they left she went back to normal.  She was also faking a pregnancy so she kept bring that up as a defense for being clean.

I finally gave her the get a job ultimatum after over a year of her lying and making up excuses on why she kept getting hired and not starting. These were simple work from home jobs that didn‚Äôt require much pre-employment screening besides a background check & identity verification.

She finally got a job and paid her phone bill and rent for the first time last month. Instead of asking her to pay again for the next cycle of payments with her last January check, I decided to give her a ‚Äúplay check‚Äù to spend on herself. Lord why did I do that?! 

She‚Äôs been taking xanax every day since. I noticed on day 1, but didn‚Äôt want to be accusatory so I asked my mom if she noticed. My mom asked her and she got defensive.  Finally, after a few days a coworker of hers told me some things I‚Äôm still confused about. But, when I confronted my sister and told her we could go get a drug test she came clean. She said she had 1 bar that she split into 4 pieces and stretched out for 4 days and she took the last piece that day. 

When I asked this week why she was still under the influence, she kept saying she split the last piece into half. A few more days go by and she‚Äôs now saying she‚Äôs split the 1 bar into 8ths lmao. It‚Äôs kind of comical.  Thing is, these confrontations are draining af. She gets extremely aggressive. When that doesn‚Äôt work, she gets extremely defensive. When that doesn‚Äôt work, queue the waterworks. 

She claims that the xanax is for her anxiety and she isn‚Äôt abusing it. She says it makes her calm, yet she keeps trying to attack me one minute and crying the next saying i‚Äôm acting like her enemy and I make her want to get high or kill herself. She‚Äôs saying I‚Äôm acting like I‚Äôm perfect and throwing my drug use in my face. It hurts because it is something I overcame and I‚Äôm not talking to her from a high horse, just experience. She keeps bringing up the things she‚Äôs done for me. Minor things like blow dry my hair- I‚Äôm grateful but I‚Äôve done wayyyyyy more for her. It‚Äôs exhausting.[She‚Äôs been texting me shit like this for days](https://imgur.com/a/yERFoQH) 

She created a fake screenshot of her account balance, but won‚Äôt open the app to actually show me because she doesn‚Äôt have to. I‚Äôm a graphic designer I know better.  In fact, while I was on a zoom call with my client today she was banging on my bedroom door threatening to beat my ass because I hurt her feelings asking her about being high. So fucking unprofessional and embarrassing!!! 

Long story short, because there‚Äôs so much else I can say. My mom and I are both done. Our dad is sick and doesn‚Äôt pay attention to much other than his TV. She has to learn her lessons on her own. I am at a great place in my life & have made so much progress. I just want to focus on myself and my mom feels the same way. I just don‚Äôt know what to do to get her away from me. I told her April initially, but the volatile behavior is daily and it‚Äôs weighing on me.  Our mom is currently on a flight back home and we need a plan. At first I suggested she visit a doctor and be properly prescribed a medication, but she claims she‚Äôs tried them all and only xanax works for her.  Even though this is my home I would have to formally evict her snd she won‚Äôt leave willingly, that seems like a pain & I‚Äôd rather not.

Discussion!,"In my experience, there are several different stages of addiction. The first being the complete belief that you are in control, having a good time and that its something that you want to do..

&#x200B;

Then comes the consequences, the occasional moment of clarity when you realise that you started the day with one intention, but ended up with something completely different. I.e. going out for one drink, waking up after a blackout 2 days later. For many, the consequences happen very quickly, for some, it takes years to develop into a problem. There is quite a lot of denial at this stage. NOBODY wants to be labelled 'addict' and further more, nobody like the idea that they have no power of their problem, that their willpower is basically zero and some instinctual pleasure seeking part of the brain is overriding any rational thought whatsoever. 

Hopefully, this is the point where recovery can begin. Starting to take responsibility, working on the problem, taking one of the many different routes to recovery, finding something that works. 

Not everybody's recovery is smooth. Sometimes it takes time, sometimes relapses happen. And I gotta say, a relapse after you've admitted a problem and spent some time in recovery can be absolutely brutal because it further confirms that you have a problem and that despite all the evidence you still ent and did it anyway.

Okay, so I've given a pretty shitty outline of some stages of addiction - really I wanted to set the scene for how you would like others to see your problem. Lets face it, the majority of people don't understand it at all. They think you're weak or hedonistic or selfish or just plain stupid..  
Personally, I would like sympathy. I know that sounds self-pitying.. but it is a genuine mental illness. Nobody chooses to end up homeless, in a psych ward, losing their home, job, family, friends, possessions.. swapping it all for another drink, another hit.. whatever. It's INSANE.

So, I'd like people close to me to have a bit of sympathy that I am battling my own brain. For me, it borders on Schizophrenia - there is an impulse, a voice a drive in my head that I have come to realise isn't me, although it sounds like me, its in the same voice in the same space as my inner monologue resides - it isn't me. I shouldn't listen to it.

My hypothetical question:  


A long term relationship consists of a couple; 2 addicts in recovery. One is a drug addict, the other a sex addict. Both have only known each other in recovery.

The drug addict relapses, it takes 1 month to get clean again and begin repairing the damage.

The sex addict relapses, goes on Tinder and has a series of one night stands. The partner finds out.

....Comments?

Bearing in mind I just said that I would like sympathy and understanding. All addictions are basically the same thing. Be it a substance or a behaviour. Gambling, shopping, tech, sex, drugs, alcohol.. you only have to look at the front page here to see the variety of issues people are facing. 

In my mind - I want there to be a difference. I feel that cheating is just that. Using addiction as an excuse or as a free-pass shouldn't count. But really, is there a difference? It's addiction all the same.  


I just wanted to generate a discussion and hear your thoughts and ideas on this . What would you do if you were the partner in this scenario? Do you forgive the drug relapse but not the sex? Is there no difference.. is there a huge difference?  Other people are involved rather than just a drug, does it make it different?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.996707558631897}"

I don‚Äôt know where I would be if I didn‚Äôt have a family like this, and I see it way to often. Let alone my husband, that absolute saint of a man. He did not have to stay. 

even though I can relate to the pitfalls of addiction, I understand heroin withdrawals and everything that comes with using, I can‚Äôt deny I had an easier time with support. I want to help these people the best I can, but recently I feel like I‚Äôm the person I hated when I was getting clean. Not because they weren‚Äôt good at their job, I absolutely hated when it seemed like people on the other side had better chances then me because of their situations.

Now I think drug addicts actually have good reasons. For one you're spending money on something that makes you high and feel good. I have gambled so I can say that there is no high or feel good with gambling. First time I did it put $2 in and walked out with $17 and I did have the high and good feeling because I had just got $15 for free pretty much. Second time I gambled I put in $14 and walked out with no payout, so $14 dollars broker then when I walked in. This led me to the logical conclusion that gambling does not give out free money and is stupid and for stupid gullible people. 

I'm writing this post because my best friend of 12 years is a drug addict and gambling addict and he puts all this money into a dumpster and never has money for meth and kinda just expects me to constantly share with him and then when I run out of meth he of course doesn't have any for me which kinda is just a big ""fuck you"" right in my face.

Well he got paid and I hadn't yet and was broke and I asked how much he wanted to get and he said he only wanted to spend $100. Anyway we do that, split it up, and I give him $50 a few days later when I get paid. Now by that time the half we each had was gone and I was buying my usual quarter (around $400) to last me 2 weeks until next payday while my friend is already broke, no drugs, and gambled $800, walking away with nothing. 

I tell him I am not smoking, sharing, fronting, nothing I'm fucking DONE. I'm gonna be selfish and I'm not going to feel bad about it. This seems so logical to me that any person with a fucking brain would stop gambling. 

Now my good friend who I love very much is not a stupid gullible retard and he's actually very logical and has common sense. Except for when it comes to gambling.",0,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9428699016571045}"

For context, i‚Äôm gonna paste that story but you skip over it or skim through it if you choose, there will be a clear indication as to where I resume this story.

(Previous reddit post about a month ago) 

Male, 21 years old and come from a family with addiction issues. Started drinking in high school at parties and on weekends sometimes, never became a daily issue at the time.

It was when I started smoking weed around graduation that I realized I have addiction issues because I smoked pretty much everyday since then (3 years ago now) and have tried to quick pretty much everyday since and failed. Put the weed down cause of anxiety in Dec 2020 and picked up drinking. Boy oh boy was I in for a ride of a life time. What followed was Jail, misery, hopelessness, complete severance of relationships, regret, financial problems, etc. Keep in mind i‚Äôm not diagnosed depression or pretty much anything. before alcohol the first 20 years of my life were just fine and completely normal. I come from a VERY close family of 7 people, (2 married parents of 30 years and 4 siblings of whom i‚Äôm very close with) Which goes to show just how incredibly powerful this drug is and what it can do to even somebody who is well situated.

Was always self aware of everything I did and what I was doing to myself, just couldn‚Äôt stop. I went from drinking 2-3 Tall cans of beer daily in December 2020 to drinking 1 litre of vodka daily by the time May 2021 came. I pretty much dealt with what a typical alcoholic would have dealt with in the span of their 40 year battle per say, but crammed into the span of 5 months. It was ridiculous. 

Went to rehab June 1st 2021, haven‚Äôt drank since. That is‚Ä¶ until 5 days ago. I am fed up with these labels I give myself and believing that I cannot sip on alcohol for the rest of my life. I‚Äôm a person who is hyper-aware of addiction and how it works as I study it all the time and live it, so I have come to the conclusion that if I am in a good place in my life and feel stable, I can drink. And to put it simply, so far, so good‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm that person who is talking to my friend at the bar and while he‚Äôs telling me something, i‚Äôm just thinking about how he hasn‚Äôt sipped on his drink for the past 10 minutes.. wondering how? why? because I would have had my first 3 beers finished in 5 minutes to get the convos started. I am FASCINATED by people who leave the bar with their drinks half full, it doesn‚Äôt compute in my brain. Relatable eh? 

Therefore, i‚Äôve taken this knowledge and I am now applying it to my lifestyle. I drank one beer on January 10th, decided to leave a little bit in the glass as I walked out. Drank another beer January 12th, left a little bit in the glass again. Drank 2 beers tonight, stopped myself before going further.

I know I am putting myself at risk for what happened last time, all i‚Äôm trying to say is that I guess for a person that has brain abnormalities (addiction predisposition), it is taking A LOT of will power to do this, but so far I feel like I can do this. I‚Äôm not saying that all of a sudden I don‚Äôt have those addict tendencies like before, it took absolutely EVERYTHING inside of me to leave those last sips in and walk away, and to not go to the liquor store and get more, because fuck I really wanted to. So I guess for us ‚Äúaddicts‚Äù if you want to drink again, obviously you can BUT it WILL come at a price. And that price for us ‚Äúalcoholics‚Äù is a very, very strong will power and mindset to control it. Some of us just may not be able to afford it. 

*Not intended to encourage drinking again, just my thoughts and experiences so far*


(Story resumes here)

Everything I said in that story I firmly believed. All it took was about a week and what I found is that I quickly started to care less about my principals and routines and started picking up 1 more beer than I planned to per night and so on. It‚Äôs absolutely astonishing but I get it now. If you cannot drink in moderation, I genuinely now believe you never will. I have a disease, similar to somebody who deals with diabetes and requires insulin to survive. What I require is total sobriety and it pains me but at this point all I want is to be sober. I‚Äôve spent countless nights begging god, the universe, whatever you believe in to heal me of this and let me sober and not buy a substance the next day but I end up doing it because, well, addiction. It‚Äôs a fucking pain in my ass. As it is for all of you beautiful people who are here to help and support. 

I didn‚Äôt really think much about typing all this but i‚Äôm really drunk right now (Two 750ml bottles of vodka in to be exact) and I thought i‚Äôd just wing it because it‚Äôs getting me out of my head and all i‚Äôm looking for is ideas, responses, love, just something. I know I need to quit now and i‚Äôve planned to set my first day tomorrow for the rest of my life. It‚Äôs just fucking god damn hard when you‚Äôre only 21 and have the illusion that you have the rest of your 20‚Äôs to party, have fun, get fucked up, have sex, pursue maximum dopamine release etc. I guess my main message here is for somebody who is an alcoholic, or as doctors put it, alcohol use disorder, we just can‚Äôt fucking drink. Just can‚Äôt. Unless you‚Äôre prepared to end up in Jail, loose your family, all relationships, become depressed and anxious etc. I love you alcohol, but I hate you.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9852403402328491}"
2022-02-03 02:17:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/sjcxg5/getting_frustrated_with_addict_brothers_and/,Getting Frustrated with addict brothers and enabling mother,"My oldest brother, 40, and another older brother, 38, are both life long addicts, starting somewhere shortly after high school. My oldest got into heroin and opiates and has always lived with my mom, recently transitioning into meth on and off a few years ago. The other one was straight into uppers and never got the same leniency with my mom.

The 40 year old is entirely dependent on my mom financially, hasn't held down a job and hasn't even tried to be employed in 4 or 5 years. The 38 year old is in prison.

It's frustrating me because my mom can barely make rent, I find myself lending her money to just make ends meet and she refuses to acknowledge that it all stems from extra expenses for the 40yo as well as money on the 38 yo's books. She earns more than I do but has horrible money management and constantly lives paycheck to paycheck. The 40yo has always been welcome at her house and contributed little to nothing. What's worse, he is constantly venting to me about how toxic our mom is and how much she holds him back. He has a drug fueled religious fervor that has led him to write biblical passages on the wall and draw biblical scenes in sharpie when he is high all around their apartment. He has become angry and threatened violence if she even suggests that there are areas in which he could improve and constantly says the drugs aren't an issue. It's hard for me to argue because his life choices have never led to any of the consequences that would normally accompany a lifelong drug habit.

The 38 yo has never had the same leniency. He has lived on the streets and committed crimes to support his habit. Things the 40yo has never had to worry about.

Since I was about 8, all we have ever talked about as a family is one of these two brothers and I (29) am feeling more and more exhausted with it. My mom will invite me over to their appt (with sheets pinned over the windows and sharpie writing everywhere) and acts like if we all eat dinner and watch TV we can collectively pretend like everything is normal. Or if she comes over to my house or my other brother's (non-addict) house she thinks it's unfair that we aren't comfortable with the 40 yo there. It just feels delusional.

The 40 yo always says I'm the only person he can talk to and trust and I try to play a supportive role/ gently nudge him the right way. But at a certain point the pattern has to stop. The conversation always turn to how toxic Mom is in his eyes, which obviously makes me try to encourage him to get a job and move out, but he blows it off and acts like she's the one who needs to change and be more encouraging of his bizarre, constantly changing life goals. His stance stems from the idea that ""families need to support each other all the time, regardless of their problems"" but doesnt see the hipocrisy and the fact that he has never supported anyone, even himself.

We have tried interventions with all 3, including trying to convince my mom to stop enabling. But she can't bear to do it and is convinced that the 40yo isn't strong enough to survive any tough love. In her mind, he will starve or overdose the moment she stops enabling so she just keeps doing what she's doing. Her intentions, although misguided, are always about helping them. She would starve and live in the cold, and almost has, if it meant they were warm and fed.

I'm feeling trapped. Like I can't move forward with my own life. I want to get married and have kids soon but I'm scared that their lives will be tainted as well. I want to move out of town but my GF has a good career here and if I leave I think my mom will be swallowed up entirely by the 40yo. I don't know where to go from here.

I immediately become hooked on any substance or activity that provides dopamine. I begin violently craving them to the point that it is the only thing I can think about and when I‚Äôll do it next. Here‚Äôs a brief list of past and/or current addictions (from least to worst destructive). Feel free to skip around, summary at the end. 

Food 

It‚Äôs the only consistent addiction in my life. I‚Äôve been doing it since I was about 11. I‚Äôm not obese or anything but I wish I had control over what goes into my body, and I wouldn‚Äôt mind losing some weight. I‚Äôve eaten 4000 calories in a sitting to fill that void, usually followed by a day of strict restriction. I think that I regain control by over eating. 

People

I become absolutely obsessed with people I‚Äôm attracted to, which is normal, but I feel that I am on an extreme end of the spectrum. Within the first week of meeting the person they usually consume my every thought. Hence my strict no dating policy for myself. 

shop lifting 

This one was short lived. I did it for the first time in august and the last time in December. I think and hope it was the last time. Something about the rush of adrenaline during and after made it unbearable to resist. And getting away with it, well I was nothing less than a god in the moment. I realized it was a problem when I did it when I was with my mom, dad and sisters. I stole a small magnet. After leaving the store, while still high on the adrenaline, I showed off my token. My mother pulled me aside and rightfully so reprimanded me. I didn‚Äôt care in the moment but in hindsight it was devastating. 

Wreckless driving 

This is one that I try not to do because I know that it could end up with others injured or worse. The funny thing about addiction is that in the moment you do not care about anyone else, the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù is the only important thing. I‚Äôve never been this type of person, I‚Äôve always- well I still am, I am tender, kind and thoughtful. But my personality is pushed to the side when I have a chance to receive the high I need. This is devastating to me because I do not wish to harm anyone. 

Self harm 

Im not sure what this one is about. I‚Äôm not sure if I subconsciously think that I deserve the pain, or do I like the control, or maybe its the blood. I‚Äôm not sure. This one was very short lived as well but severe while it lasted. For about a month I would cut every day, sometimes multiple times a day. It was my release when I had overeaten, when I was overwhelmed or when I hated myself. I had a panic attack when I flew across the country because I knew that there would be no way for me to cut while I was there. That day was my first day of just over two months clean. I‚Äôve since come home and have had minor urges but have been able to resist.

Alcohol 

Ive only drank a few times for good reason. The hang over is no fun. I still do get the craving for it despite the pain it will cause the next day. It shoots me into a world besides my own where I am able to be worry free and that‚Äôs amazing, but unhealthy. It feels as though I am a toddler again, before I went though everything I went through. My rock bottom was probably drinking stolen vodka out of a coke bottle in my room alone at midnight. This was when I realized that I had spun out of control. I don‚Äôt think I have ever become addicted to alcohol but I definitely have the potential to become given my history. 

Weed

This one is a combination of the effect from self harm and alcohol. it provides a release but I‚Äôm not truly addicted. Weed provides me with a release not an escape. It shushes my racing mind for just enough time for my body to catch up. I would not find my use of weed concerning if it were recreational, but its not, it‚Äôs a release and a coping mechanism. That makes it unhealthy. 

Adderall 

I would like to make it clear that this is by prescription. I have adhd and take it daily, sorta. The thing is is that I have become obsessed with the effect it provides. I‚Äôm able to function like a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person for the time being and that is something that I have always craved. The voice in my head that has never stopped has finally stopped, and god its like a breath of fresh air. The vibrating in my body slows and I can think. Today I had to skip my Adderall for medical reasons and all day I groaned to myself about how badly I needed it. I actually cried in class. Adderall has been my lord and savior but I‚Äôm addicted. 

Ativan  

This is also a prescription. It is from 2018 though. I suffered from crippling anxiety and this was prescribed to get my through the school day. The thing is is that I‚Äôm not supposed to be taking it anymore. But once an a while I take it for the euphoria. I‚Äôve only done this a couple times but Ativan is nothing to play with. I‚Äôve found myself craving it when nothing else is an option. 

Summary: I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm posting this. I know its really long, so if you didn‚Äôt read, I‚Äôm slightly addicted to a bunch of things. I think that each addiction developed as a coping mechanism from the previous, but I‚Äôm not sure. I know I need to get to the root of my pain and in turn, why I do this. I have a lot to figure out. I have a feeling that there are several mental illnesses that need a diagnosis. And I probably need some intense therapy to work though the horrendous childhood of mine. In the mean time it is terrifying growing up and watching myself throw everything away. I hope that this helped someone.",0,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9897806644439697}"

 Finally, I have one month without school so i decided it will also be one month without messanger. 
And I feel great, I'm more productive, I am finally able to have a moment of silence in my life , a moment for myself. I allow myself to write back only on my PC so I am not online every single moment in my life. It really works for me, everything is far better.
The thing is, I need  access to my messanger account when I go back to school. I'm engaged in many school activities and I need to stay updated all the time while in the building. 
I'm concerned going back to school will send me on another  texting addiction spiral, I don't want that.
 On the other hand I don't want to resign and sacrifice my school duties either.

There was a point in time where I thought he was suicidal because he wouldnt care at all about his health even after he got out of the hospital. All he does is sit in his room, smoke marijuana-- which hes literally NOT SUPPOSED TO DO-- and play videogames. No worries, and not a care in the world.

And yes he does have a job, but he spends most of his money on marijuana, im guessing. The rest goes to his meds.

I genuinely dont know what to do. Im still in highschool (15F), and the academic stress paired with my home situation just makes me want to give up at times. Every solution in my mind seems to come to a dead end that just always ends up with my brother not caring again.

I'm realizing that I don't really care about anything. I'm starting a business, but that's really only been for the purpose of making more money, so I could attract higher quality women.

Started with benzos I was prescribed and codeine my mom had laying around. After 4 family and friend deaths, and a car accident that left me with brain damage and severe PTSD, I began abusing fentanyl and heroin. That was about two years ago now. 

In August, I checked myself into rehab because my dealer robbed me and, honestly, I couldn't find another dealer and couldn't stand the withdrawals. I told them I got tired of living as an addict but it was a lie. 

My family had NO idea I was an addict. Seriously. When my mom found out I was in rehab, she asked if it was adderall or something.

I was there for 8 weeks and they had me on suboxone. At the time of my discharge, I wanted to relapse right then. I didn't feel any better, despite doing everything they told me to do and trying my hardest. Meditation, praying (despite not believing in a higher power), nightly reviews, my fourth step. I did fucking prayer circles and everything. I really tried to find God. 

So I essentially was white knuckling it for three months. Taking my suboxone, going to my appointments. I wasn't able to find a meeting that I liked, the only one within walking distance was all people 55+. They told me that I should find one with people my age. I started getting suicidal.

My drug of choice was oxycodone.
It hasn‚Äôt crossed my mind for years.
A couple weeks ago my so was injured pretty badly. They prescribed her 5mg oxy every 4 hours, I open her pill bottle and deliver her meds as she wasn‚Äôt able. Every time I was shaking internally reminiscing about the past all the nostalgia coursing through my body. Of course I wouldn‚Äôt take her meds as she is crying in the next room‚Ä¶ that isn‚Äôt me anymore. 
2 long weeks of this. 
I kept my sobriety. 
Tonight she has 3.5 pills left sitting in the closet. She isn‚Äôt taking them anymore. That stupid orange bottle is like the eye of Mordor calling me. 
I know addiction is life long. 
So tonight I‚Äôll take a deep breathe and remember how good the last 7 years have been, how I haven‚Äôt had to lie to doctors, deal with gang members or steal from medicine cabinets. 
I‚Äôll take a really deep breathe and remember how since I have stopped abusing, I got married, bought a house and kept really good jobs.  
I‚Äôll take another really deep breathe and wake my wife and explain that I‚Äôm struggling and we need to get rid of them. 

Someone once told me I would wake up one day and the sky would be bluer. 

This was and is true. 

I just didn‚Äôt think that sometimes the sky would feel heavy and dark. 

Still‚Ä¶ everyday has been worth it. 

Thanks for letting me vent internet.",60,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.873713493347168}"

My moms a nurse, my best friends a nurse, and my other close friend is a phd scientist and they all seem to agree that its bad so I trust them on it. But then, why do I understand that ridiculous nonsense is bad for the body, but somehow methamphetamine is different. Its really not. I cannot think of a single medical professional who would ever suggest a patient use meth the way I and I'm sure most of you reading this would use or have used it in the past. Addiction isn't a disease caused by a lack of intelligence or education or anything, its different than that.

Look I am definitely not a scientist or a medical professional. But I think I may be onto something here folks!",0,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9970929622650146}"
