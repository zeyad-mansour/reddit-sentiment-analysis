I have absolutely no issue with this. Hes the best person I‚Äôve ever met and puts so much effort into our relationship and I try to do the same. 
I‚Äôm worried about him lately as he has been trying to get off drugs and alcohol, and trying to live a bit more of a wholesome lifestyle as he had a bit of a cocaine problem for a few years. He only really does it now when he drinks, which he never wants to when we‚Äôre together...but when his friends ask him to hangout, it‚Äôs only ever involving drinking and going out. He‚Äôs told all his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù he‚Äôs trying to stop but none of them seem to really care. 

He‚Äôs usually pretty good and says no, but a few of his friends have started ripping into him saying that he doesn‚Äôt have time for them anymore and I think he feels pressured into doing it, because he doesn‚Äôt want to loose friends. 

I don‚Äôt know how to approach the situation because I love him and want him to hang out with whoever he wants, but I‚Äôm also sick of seeing his friends treat him like shit (in my opinion) and not respect him or his want to live a different kind of life..

I‚Äôve had a full out hole in my nose for about 3 years (literally NO septum it‚Äôs not a joke or cool it‚Äôs disgusting) so I can‚Äôt imagine the damage on my chest and lungs 

I know my family will always support me and help but I can‚Äôt admit to them how deep in trouble I am to ask for help.
I‚Äôm stubborn and can admit that ultimately it‚Äôs MY choice to change and try and as scared as I am I won‚Äôt do better, so maybe that‚Äôs it‚Äôs that.. 
 I almost don‚Äôt care if I don‚Äôt live I‚Äôm so stuck and hurt and alone .. but I still don‚Äôt think I want to die yet, I haven‚Äôt lost all hope in myself yet but I‚Äôm close

I need help, I don‚Äôt have a friend to support me, 
My two best friends that i was able to tell and be open with, couldn‚Äôt give me the support I needed, I felt like I begged them till it just hurt. 
They don‚Äôt get it I guess, I don‚Äôt blame them. However it hurts to feel like you have no real friends. 

QUESTION: 

I have no one to really talk to or encourage me knowing the whole story ( my addiction is my secret) 
Is there a ‚Äúpeer support‚Äù type of thing I could look into..  or where should I start? I dont know if I can stop? I want to so bad.. i know it‚Äôs dumb

so to start from the beginning i first tried coke when i was around 17, it was something i was offered and i thought why not. i never did it again until recently. i‚Äôm now 20 years old and most of my co workers do coke, and a lot of it. i started by just bumming from them to buying my own grams. it wasn‚Äôt a problem at first and i was only occasionally doing key bumps at work just to get through my day. it‚Äôs been a few weeks and now i do multiple lines a day and if it weren‚Äôt for me living with my boyfriend i could probably do grams a day. i love coke so much. i love the rush it gives me. i love how im not hungry or tired when i do it. even if i don‚Äôt have a reason to do it, i‚Äôll still snort lines all through the night. 
my boyfriend found out that my co workers do coke, at first he told me that he would be devastated if i ever did anything like that. then a few weeks pass by and he starts asking me if i‚Äôm doing coke, of course i say no. when he asked i didn‚Äôt feel as if it were a problem and i had been telling myself that if it became a problem then i would tell my boyfriend so he could help me. there have been multiple occasions where i just want to blurt out that i have a coke problem. i was so so so close to doing it the other day when we had an argument but i ended up just keeping quiet. today he told me that if he ever found i was doing coke or that i brought it into our home, that he would break the lease with me and never talk to me again. for him to say that was kinda scary because this man loves me so much, i see it, our families see it and our friends see it and for him to say he‚Äôd leave me was sort of a shock to me. now i feel as my coke problem gets worse (because im too weak and can not stop on my own) and i really need help, that he won‚Äôt help me. has anyone gone through a problem similar to mine with a significant other? i don‚Äôt want my boyfriend to leave me but i also really want to let him know before it gets out of hand",2,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.7253654}"

My mobile phone and social media were completely consuming my life. I was in an emotional rock-bottom, and the iPhone was my escape, my distraction, my companion‚Ä¶

On Thursday night (20/2/2020), a wave of inspiration struck. It was time to do a serious cleanse, and see what difference it made on me mentally. I decided to do a bunch of daily habits, and see if I could climb out of this mental rut.

Now, I want to share my experience with you guys, and explain why I‚Äôm going to keep my phone turned off - quite possibly for good.

So‚Ä¶I turned off my phone and got my girlfriend to put passwords on the website blocker on my computer.

Each day, I decided to get up at 6 am and go through a morning routine, consisting of:

* 10 minutes of coffee and water
* 10 minutes of meditation
* 10 minutes affirmation
* 10 minutes visualising my perfect day
* 10 minutes writing 10 goals
* 10 minutes stretching
* 60 minutes gym workout

I also committed to a daily massage for 60 minutes, where I would use that 60 minutes to meditate, and to journal every day and plan my following day. 

I wrote all these tasks down on my whiteboard and went to sleep.

Now, I want to share 3 key things that happened with you. One will be the cravings, one will be the benefits and one will be about what happened after I turned on my phone and Facebook again‚Ä¶

**Cravings**

Now, I have defeated many addictions throughout my life. Alcohol, weed, nicotine, cocaine and so on. I know what a craving is and I have had a lot of experience dealing with them.

Interestingly, I felt INTENSE cravings. Let me try and explain it‚Ä¶

When I say a craving, it wasn‚Äôt the feeling of missing the phone or checking social media. It was the anticipation that one day, I‚Äôll be able to check my messages and see all the people that have tried to get in touch with my because I have only been accessible through e-mail.

That would literally flood my body with adrenaline and dopamine. The exact same feeling used to happen when I would think of, say, a cigarette.

This was really interesting. I knew I was addicted to my smartphone and social media, but I didn‚Äôt think the intense feelings would be the same as a drug.

Obviously, this feeling is very hard to manage, but I got through it fine.

**Benefits**

I want to list a number of benefits that I have found from stopping. I‚Äôm not sure whether the benefits have come from stopping social media and the smartphone, or the habits and morning routine I have been doing. I think it‚Äôs a combination.

&#x200B;

* I am more present than I have ever been in my life. I think this is partly down to no phone, and partly down to the meditation/massage. I enjoy the gaps and moments of silence in between thoughts more than ever.
* I am better at impulse control. Before, any time I had a thought or an idea, I‚Äôd immediately Google it or message someone about it. Now, without being able to grab my phone, I can‚Äôt do that. This has spread into other areas of life.
* Productivity has been sky high. I‚Äôve been creating more content than I ever have before, and the quality has been great. 
* I have been way more focussed. I am able to focus on the task at hand without distraction.
* Work has been more enjoyable. Because I am fully immersed in the moment, I enjoy work a lot more.

**Turning On Facebook on Day 7**

I turned on Facebook last night to market a video I created yesterday, to try and get some leads for a lead magnet I created. I also wanted to assign 3 members to a Facebook group I own to become moderators, so I don‚Äôt need to police it. What happened was quite interesting‚Ä¶

I had been emotionally building up to the day where I could check my messages, the same way I‚Äôd build up to taking a drink/drug. I was excited. So, I unblocked Facebook, and I immediately felt myself get sucked into it all. I was only supposed to go on it for 15 minutes, but then 30 minutes went by, then 45‚Ä¶I was mindful of what was going on‚Ä¶

So I finished what I had to do, sent the messages that needed responding to and blocked it again. I had been emotionally excited to see the messages, and after blocking it, I felt an anti-climax. I felt slightly deflated. The exact same way I would feel after finally having a drink, or a cigarette, or a drug.

I know I sound like I‚Äôm exaggerating the impact it had, but the difference in how I felt mentally was really this extreme.

I then sat down to write my journal and plan today. My mind was all over the place. The last week, I have been more present and in the ‚Äúnow‚Äù than I ever have, but my mind was so busy after turning it off. I started writing the journal, and half way through I just wanted to give up and not bother planning tomorrow.

**Conclusion**

So, I‚Äôve blocked Facebook and turned off my phone once again‚Ä¶

Honestly, I could not recommend doing this experiment enough to other people.

I have journaled every single day, and I feel as though this is one of the most beneficial things I have done in my adult life.

My drug of choice years ago was heroin, but benzos were a close second. I came across an old bottle of xanax a few weeks ago in a family member's house. At the time I was able to resist, but over the weekend I found myself in a very stressful situation in an empty house (my wife was out of town and son was with his grandparents) - I got a hold of some of the xanax and took it. 

I have been crippled with guilt since I took it on saturday, but thankfully I had therapy last night (I go every week). My therapist explained to me that the only way I would free myself from the guilt is to drop the shroud of secrecy and come clean to my family and wife. She said it would be hard short term, but if I kept it in, I would be setting myself up for future relapse. I fought it tooth and nail, and I wouldn't have done it until she challenged me. She said, ""I know a little bit about your relationship with your wife, but now I'm learning a lot more. You can't be honest with her, can you? Is this the type of relationship you are cultivating?"" 

Her strategy worked - I love my wife so much. After she said that, I couldn't allow myself to keep it in. I told my wife. She didn't blow up and yell or threaten me, but just told me how disappointed she was in me that I would put our family at risk. The conversation was long and painful for me. I hardly slept last night, and my guilt certainly hasn't gone away, it's just changed. I feel exposed, very angry with myself, sad... I can't help but wonder: did I do the right thing? Was telling my wife the best thing I could have done? Now I feel worse than I did before. Opinions, support, comments are appreciated, thanks for any help. 

TLDR - I relapsed on benzos and my therapist convinced me to come clean to my wife who didn't know. I feel worse now than I did before. Did I do the right thing? It doesn't feel like it.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59174335}"

Recently I started working as a researcher for a series of documentaries about addiction for the Dutch public broadcasting (NPO3). That's why I'm looking for people who are addicted, or who recently stopped using.

We intend to follow a few people for several months, so we can (hopefully) give viewers a deeper understanding of what addiction actually means. Why do you choose to use, again and again, even when you don't intend to? And why is it so hard to stay sober?

In the end the viewer (hopefully) gets a personal insight in the lives of several people, and their relentless drive to numb themselves. The documentaries should present an unprejudiced representation of people who are addicted. We want to show that addicts are also plain people, although their lives sometimes maybe seems to be different.With these documentaries we hope to nuance the general knowledge about addiction, and to fight stigmatization.

The coming two months we are researching. We will try to speak with as many people as we can, to get a better idea of what is happening right now. So right now I'm just curious about your stories. The first contacts will stay private.

If you want to know more about these documentaries, or when you want to contact me, you can send me a PM.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.60261685}"

-Low dose benzo (6 mg valium)
-Risperidone (4mg)


Now why i'm stuck, ilness and where i live.

At the moment, i'm in a AirBnB. I have 2 weeks to find an appartment where i can live. 2 weeks is ok, because i'm in France and can go anywhere at least if the city is big enough. But because of my illness, i can't have a job. And i can't find one in 1 weeks. I get ""paid"" 900‚Ç¨/months to help me live because i can't work. 
But people who sell appartment are recluant to give keys to a guy who can't have a job even if he has enough money to pay every month.

Illness mmh, covered up by drugs, but it look like schizophrenia, or paranoid autism with OCD.
PTSD and social phobia.


My Family.

My family is clearly abusing me emotionaly. I can't rely on them. On top of that, some wan't me in jail or in a psychiatric hospital.

My mother can give me a litle bit of money, she has a lot, but she is abusing me also, making me a child when i'm feeling bad and making me feeling bad when i do things like a real men.
Atm, my family all making me crazy. I did 3 psychotic crisis in 2 week because of them and i was stable for 1 year before.

I have no friends, no girlfriend, nothing. I'm alone.
Not fully alone, i have a therapist, he help me but he can't do much 

I really need to find a appartment and do my stuff.


What i wan't.

I have many buisness idea on the internet. I need to launch some ASAP. I don't wan't to be seen like a dysfunctional men my whole life.

And i wan't to be free of some drugs.

First phenibut, i wan't to quit phenibut. But i'm afraid that even if i slow tapper 50mg/day i will have a rough time coming of (it potentiate valium so i will have to slowly go up on valium while reducing it)
I think i will also slowly reduce caffeine. Like 100mg/week at the same time.

But at the moment, i'm just destroyed because of lack of sleep, instable emotions (family), fear of being lock up in jail, fear of being killed by my father, or whatever.

I need advices, the obvious first step is find an appartment and keep taking drugs. 
But once i'm safe after this ? What should i do ?",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8026074}"

I‚Äôve been sober since 11/19/2019. I was addicted to cocaine, but before that I was an alcoholic. Today was really fucking hard. For the past two weeks, my cravings to use again we‚Äôre coming on strong and I was doing my best to ignore them until today. Today I caved in and I bought half a gram. I didn‚Äôt finish it and I threw the rest away. I felt awful, my heart was racing and I felt like I couldn‚Äôt sit still. I was so uncomfortable and just wanted it to be over just as soon as it started. I left work early because I felt sick and I felt like I need to rest. Well the craving came back and was stronger this time. So I went and bought another half a gram. I did half of it and flushed the rest. The weird thing about it, the second time I knew I just needed to feel the thrill of buying it and doing the first little bit. Then I was done. After I flushed it, I immediately wanted it back. But I knew that it would just make me feel worse than I already did. I was so mad at myself until I admitted what I did to a friend. What I didn‚Äôt realize was that I needed to have this relapse. It was to remind and reassure myself that I would never touch this shit again. I spent four years on a medication that turned me into someone I didn‚Äôt recognize and during that time I got hooked on coke. After 3 months of no coke or that medication, I guess I needed to know for sure that this is definitely something I don‚Äôt like to do. It‚Äôs hard building a life and a personality for four years that‚Äôs not even who you are or someone you think you would ever be. So I‚Äôm starting over as an entirely different person and I think I had to relapse to know that the new me isn‚Äôt interested in doing drugs ever. I don‚Äôt even like to drink anymore. There is so much to discover and learn about myself that I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do with myself besides work, eat and sleep. But I want to say I am glad that I got the closure and reassurance that I needed. Being honest about what you are going through is so important and having a support system is necessary.

I've been on methadone like 3 years now. At first I had no intention on quitting fetty.

I had been section 35d (Massachusetts) twice went to rehab etc. Nothing worked until drug tested probation. 

Once probation was up I was going strong. About to get a third take home. 8 months clean. I lost a bottle. They took all my take homes. Ny anger got the better. I got kicked out. 

I remained clean my next 6 or 7 days without methadone. Planning to switch to sub. I told the doc I wasn't sick wanted to wait to take sub. He assured me. Incoming PWD. I ran away from doc office and ambulance. Got home and broke my 8 months.

I've had a love affair with fentanyl again ever since. I hate it. I've been telling myself shit for months now. Finally theres a point in my life where I dont want to live with fentanyl even tho I can. I used to be concerned about hiding it affording it etc. I took care of all that and thought I would never have to quit if I could manage.

But now I want to quit. After the suboxone tailspin I got on a different clinic and my dose was incredibly inadequate for a very long time. 6 months in I went back to the clinic I was kicked from.

I been here now 2 months again. And finally idc if I can afford it. I don't want it. I want a life like the guys I work with. I wanna be normal.

I just got promoted to on site manager at my recycle center. I'm 23. There are guys that done do heroin and fentanyl and work hard and they dont get my position. It's time for me to grow up past this.

I'm into my third day. This is the longest I've been except probation or rehab. My methadone is on the very cusp of being just barely enough.

I've gotten xanax. My first day I took 1 half a green 2mg bar. Too much. I had a great day and went thru it quick but I didnt remember shit. I took the other half soon after the first half that day.

Ever since I've been breaking them into thirds. 1 in the am. 1 at 2pm and 1 around 7. It is helping with cravings and anxiety immensely.

     Today marks the 3rd day I haven't smoked weed and the first day I haven't smoked cigarettes. I'm a 22 year old male and I've been smoking smoking marijuana daily for at least the last 4 years and I use to smoke occasionally since I was 13. I've been smoking 1-2 pack-a-week for about 4 years with a couple months in the middle that I took a break. I'm really struggling with the boredom and I don't really know what to do with myself right now. I don't know what to do with all the free time I have since I stopped. I also feel it's important to mention I have ADD and the lack of stimulation is killing me. I use to be prescribed medication but I hated the way it made me feel and it just turned me into someone who isn't me. I've always struggled with laziness and boredom and I would always use weed and cigarettes as a way to kill time and I would also use them as excuses for my anxiety and deperession but I've concurred that mountain and now it's time for this one. If I'm being honest right now, the only reason for this post is to hear some encouragement and some tips on how everyone else has overcame their addictions. What habit did you replace your addictions with? I've started to read more but there's only so much you can read, and I've been working out and I could and should be going more. Would it be easier to quit one thing at a time instead of both?
     Thank you to anyone and everyone, all the support I've seen on Reddit is just so amazing and I'm so happy that there's a place like this for people to go and talk to others, because sometimes i know it's very hard to talk to people (even your best friends) about any/all of this stuff. It's a lot easier to type things out and it took me a long to time to even get the courage to talk about my addictions, so to anyone who has shared their struggles with addiction thank you, and to everyone who hasn't talked about yet but reads everyone elses stories, you are more powerful than you know.

He‚Äôs always been a big drinker and into partying - I used to participate pretty heavily with him up until about two years ago when I started in a new career that I love, and had to deal with some physical health and mental health issues.

After a few years together we lived in what my friendship circle knows as the ‚Äúparty house‚Äù. It was me, him and his best friend Dave. The house was a nightmare, not possible to get any sleep. People always coming and going, always someone sleeping on the couch when I would get up for work. Being around drugs constantly I kept participating even though I knew I didn‚Äôt want to anymore. I lasted 10 months there before I packed up my shit and left on a Wednesday night - we had a date planned but instead when I got home from work all the boys were doing lines of coke off the kitchen bench. We broke up temporarily 18 months ago but after promising to change we ended up back together - though this time living separately. He‚Äôs still at Dave‚Äôs and I‚Äôm living with a girlfriend.

The partying got worse. They don‚Äôt go out anymore but they‚Äôre doing cocaine 2/3 nights a week at home. We would have plans on a Saturday that are ruined by him not sleeping the Thursday and Friday before.

We had countless conversations about how he wants to quit this lifestyle but doesn‚Äôt know how to, I threatened to leave him for months before I finally cracked last weekend. He had promised me he wouldn‚Äôt be drinking or using but I received Snapchat‚Äôs from his friends of him cooked at 7am.

After a week apart I met up with him last night to talk further about how we both feel. He begged for me to give him another chance. He‚Äôs promised me that he‚Äôs so serious about changing this time that he‚Äôs told Dave he needs to move out, he will delete every dealers number and tell all his toxic friends to not call him anymore. He wants to cut down on drinking and spend more time doing sober activities, camping, join the gym. He wants to prove to me that he‚Äôs ready to grow up.

We both still love each other but where do we go from here? I‚Äôve told him I need to see physical evidence of change before I can consider committing to him. Do you think he‚Äôs telling the truth?

Hi there! I am 27 y.o. male struggling to give up smoking and drinking and generally destructing myself. I need someone to tell me that this is doable because I am tired of trying and failing.

I can't make a shortcut of my situation so you'll have to stick with me here. I've been smoking and drinking for almost 8 years straight no attempts to give up at all. I never gave it any thought, never thought why I am doing this to myself. I guess I was just young and stupid. I had quite a rough childhood...well it was good, not complaining here, but I had a few traumatic incidents and problems with parent support - grown up without father (died when I was 12, seen him a couple of times before he passed away) and my mother never cared about my teen issues. So I grew up learning to deal with my problems on my own, friends were never there to truly understand and not just ""listen"". Fifteen years old me was having quintessential issues - all I thought about at the time was what's my purpose of living and why on Earth I was born in such a shitty place to live (living in a shithole in some CIS country btw).

I guess all that stuff eventually determined my behavior in some way. I started having this tendency of self-destruction. As years passed I kept on smoking and drinking. Been in a deep depression couple of times, but made it through eventually. Traveled around the world for some time and after coming back home I began working as an ESL teacher (had to make a living somehow) then I found that I am doing pretty well at teaching and it became my profession. My job was incompatible with smoking so I quit. I still don't really understand how I gave it up so easily. I quitted cold turkey, but the other self-destructive habits remained. For some time I was really happy with myself - life took a new turn and it seemed to be brighter than it ever was. But all good things must come to an end, right!?

After three years of not smoking I started all over. Came back from 0 to 15 cigarettes a day. It was awful, I hated every single cigarette I smoked, but this time I couldn't quit. So last half a year I was trying to give up smoking because it affects my mind. I can't think clearly when I smoke, my decision making became worse and critical thinking in general has blunted. I've been failing to quit over and over again. Every time I returned to smoking I analyzed what I did wrong to start it again and couldn't see the reason behind it. Then I've made some research into why I am doing what I am doing and found out that this self-destructive behavior comes from my adolescence - I tend to smoke and drink whenever I feel bad or stressed and I perceive it as a support of some kind, which makes sense since nobody ever was there to support me when I needed it.

Now I work on myself. I've put a lot of effort to quit smoking. I go to the gym and work my ass off, also I work on my mindset and always try to keep myself in a good state, but however long I hold on to good things in my life there's always a moment when I break - something happens and I start feeling this urge to smoke or drink. It feels like some part of me just can't stand me being a ""good guy"". So I am wondering is it even possible to overcome this dark part of my nature that always wants me to destroy myself and hate life?! I look at it as a battle and I always lose it. Neither cigarettes nor alcohol give no pleasure or consolation any more, but still can't get rid of that shit.

TL;DR - struggling to overcome bad habits, fail to keep self-improvement consistent.

Well she was crying because she said she was in the worse withdrawals of her life and they kept telling her it was paw and gave her gabapentin and clonidine (which she ended becoming physically addicted to) and she said these medications weren't working. She also had 3 small children and said that the withdrawals were so bad she couldn't take care of them and I felt for her. I know what it's like to be in that situation so I recommend her posting to reddit for help. And you guys did help her by showing her that you can get past the blocker if you take enough, which she did and said it worked. Then next thing I know She messaged me and She was said, ""We both know that it wasn't about withdrawals and I was fine"" I'm like, dude I did not know you were just looking for away around the blocker to just get high and I wouldn't have helped you by suggesting you post on reddit, which you had me do for you, if I thought you just wanted to get high! Like I feel used and feel like shit now because I thought I was helping when in reality I was just enabling. Like I know what it's like to be in suboxone withdrawals and it sucks and it lasts months (at least for me it did) and I also have a child and know how hard it would be to take care of your kids while withdrawing like that.. Plus she was a good friend of mine in high school and I also said recovering addicts need to stick together and I would always be there to help her if she is struggling in her addiction.. but now I've done the complete opposite by showing her there is a way around the blocker and now I feel like a total piece of shit that just helped my friend get high and now she is struggling more because she's constantly tempted to get high because she knows she can now. Now she keeps messaging me talking about how she wants to take her suboxone because it's right there and she's going crazy. So I told her to get rid of it, flush them down the toilet. I told her I don't want to smoke crack (and I have 4 years clean) but if there was some crack sitting there in front of me, I would do it because as an addict that's how our brains are wired. Next thing I know she messaged me and told me she took it.. and now is struggling because she want to take the other piece........ #-.- ..... So I said get rid if them again and she said she isn't strong enough to do it, and I said then have your husband do it. Then she told me it wouldn't matter because her supplier is upstairs. So I told her to tell her supplier not to sell her any, and she said he would still anyways.. So I'm like look.. You need to go to rehab.. You just spent $10,000 (no idea where she got that kind of money in the 1st place, she's not rich) on rapid detox and you're about to throw that all away because you manipulated me and found a way to get high.. You need to go to rehab. THEN...... She comes up with the excuse that none of the rehabs take her insurance.. so I googled rehabs that take her insurance and a few popped up but she said she called and they said they didn't. So I was like look, come Monday (this conversation happened Saturday) call your insurance company and they will tell you what rehabs they cover and will get you in one.. Let's see if she will actually do it, but I doubt it. But if she messages me one more time talking about how tempted she is, or that she gave in I'm going to go off on her. I gave her advice and she makes excuses but still cries to me how she wants to stay clean. But again, I want to say thank you to all the reddit users who responded to the post I made on her behalf and I also want to apologize that we were basically tricked into helping her get around the blocker and get high. I am so mad I was shaking after she told me this. But thank you for your help anyways.  
  
TL;DR 
I made a post for my friend because she said she was withdrawing after getting the vivitrol shot and people gave advice how to get around it and she lied and just wanted people to help her so she could get high, and now she is complaining about how tempted she is and how she is struggling because she wants to take it now that she knows she can and is making excuses why she can't go to rehab",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6638562}"

sorry this is really long- 

We were in a LDR and only got to see each other a few times a year. 

This relationship didn‚Äôt start off the best. We met online and instantly flirted hard. But then he was talking to another girl who I revealed as a catfish. A very obvious catfish at that. The flirting started getting serious and I told him LDR wasn‚Äôt for me. Somehow I ignored that and kept talking to him, falling for him. After almost a year we talked about meeting up and we did after that only a handful of times. It was then I made sure he knew I could never leave my family. I‚Äôve always shared with him how close I am with my family- I lost my dad early on in my childhood and that made me close with my remaining family. 

I‚Äôm going to call him ‚ÄúD‚Äù for the sake of this post. D assured me he understood and wanted to come to me in the future to live. We talked about this many times. I opened up to D and D gave me love and attention. 

And a lot of insecurities. He made fun of me constantly and said it was teasing and joking. I would be put down for being so uptight and not taking a joke. He made fun of me over things he knew I was insecure about. My facial features, my small boobs, etc. And when I would tell him I didn‚Äôt like that he would say but I like those things about you even though the way it was said was negative. ‚ÄúWhy are your boobs so small‚Äù or ‚Äúgoodnight tiny tits‚Äù apparently isn‚Äôt mean if D likes those things about me, even though it was putting me down in a way and pointing out my insecurities it was okay. D‚Äôs logic was hard to argue. And someone liking my flaws is a good thing, right? 

D also gave me trust issues. We were open about our social media as that‚Äôs where we first met. We were active on Q&amp;A sites together, FB, instagram... I noticed D always liking the same girls photos. And not just liking them, commenting on them. Heart eyes, compliments of them being ‚Äúhot‚Äù ‚Äúpretty‚Äù or ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù - I told D this all made me really uncomfortable. D said I‚Äôm just acting like a kid. I‚Äôm just jealous. I have issues. I have jealousy issues. I have insecurity issues. It‚Äôs all me. D said it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs cheating. It‚Äôs just photos, it‚Äôs just comments. They don‚Äôt mean anything. If he‚Äôs not cheating how can I be mad? 

(TW eating disorders) Around the time I met D I was in a back and forth swing with anorexia. I had some secret tumblr accounts, but at this point in time (a little over a year in our relationship) I was really working with recovery. But with D‚Äôs constant flirting with other girls and not being in person made me so insecure I did something wrong. I asked for his passwords. I felt this was the only way for me to feel safe in this LDR. If it was just comments and likes then what was there to hide? Weirdly enough D agreed to this. Maybe it was because he would have lost me then if he hadn‚Äôt agreed. Now I wish he hadn‚Äôt so I could‚Äôve left and moved on. 

D‚Äôs communication with other girls continued. It wasn‚Äôt serious but it was flirting- physical comments. But I can‚Äôt be mad, it‚Äôs not cheating. It wasn‚Äôt until it was that is with girl #1 we will call A. A was in a relationship so for me to question D about her was insane. Can he not have friends who are girls? Thats what he said until I found him telling her he liked her and thought she was pretty. I also found at this point that he saved some of her photos. Saving photos became another issue. This is when I decided to walk away. I was completely heartbroken. I had told D countless times about my biggest fears of relationships- being cheated on, being left, being unloved. I was destroyed. I refused to talk to him. Until he wrote me a love letter. Apologizing, saying he loved me. And how he would never do that again, he regrets it all. I bought it, unfortunately. Another mistake of mine. 

I felt so close with D. I felt a false sense of security. D sees my flaws and still loves me. He could‚Äôve left me for A but he didn‚Äôt and he regrets it. D now promises to never hurt me. I opened up to D not long after even more about how in love I was. That he could do anything and I would still want him and love him. Boy was I wrong. And I know now that wasn‚Äôt love. It was D making me feel this way through manipulation. I was completely hooked. 

Throughout years 2-4 we had some of the same issues. D‚Äôs flirting, comments, girls photos. That‚Äôs when I found he saved a few particular celebrities photos. Beautiful ones of course. I thought this was kind of weird but D said I‚Äôm not there and he‚Äôs a guy. Even though I sent him hundreds and hundreds of my own nudes and videos it just wasn‚Äôt enough for D. He already used those ones, he‚Äôs bored of them. He needs new ones. I was often harassed about giving him more, when I said please stop asking he said yeah okay but would ask an hour later or the next day. I went completely unheard no matter how many times I said stop asking. Here have some now please stop asking that can‚Äôt be the only thing our relationship is about. 

D would say I complained too much. I was too jealous. I was too insecure. All I do is complain about him- asking for him to not ask for nudes, telling him of girls he was making me uncomfortable about. That wasn‚Äôt fair because D was going through hard times. He didn‚Äôt have a job, he was ‚Äòhomeless‚Äô aka living on his friends or cousins couches. But I believed in D. this was bad circumstances. This was because of his bad childhood, because of his mom. So I shut up for awhile again. 

Until he cheated on me with two people and I caught it. This time the cheating was a bit different. Both the girls he cheated on me with were MTF. Now, I already knew D liked MTF, he however would use words not so pleasant. I assume it was more a sexual thing at the time. he said he just liked the porn. I was never sure how to feel about this. I‚Äôm bisexual myself, I‚Äôve watched girl on girl and guy on guy before so this was okay. I felt it was a little weird only because I felt he was sexualizing MTF but I don‚Äôt know enough to know if that‚Äôs wrong or okay. But seeking out two MTF and talking to them, sending them nudes and asking for them in return? I did know how I felt about that and that was cheating. I felt destroyed. We broke up. I refused to talk to him. 

Well, I tried to refuse to. But me, I have this bad habit of ignoring or muting him but waiting to see what he says and the second he replies I read it and reply anyways. D told me it was his twin brother pretending to be him. D did not cheat. His brother has all his passwords. His brother always does this stuff. I didn‚Äôt believe him at first but he would call, and plead. He even had his brother talk to me and say it was him. I was so heartbroken. I didn‚Äôt know what to believe. D was so angry that I would think he would do these things. It was all his brothers fault. And just like that it was easier to let D mend my broken heart then try and leave. So D would cheat and I would be paranoid. Then I would be put down for being jealous and having trust issues. 

One year later and we have good moments and bad. I still complain too much for him but I am trying so hard to be a good girlfriend. I tell D I am jealous because LDR is so hard, it‚Äôs different when he‚Äôs not here. I wouldn‚Äôt feel insecure if he was here about other girls because then I would have D in person and those other girls would just have words. But right now I just have words too so it‚Äôs hard. I gave D money - he was homeless after all and his talk about not eating and having no where to go made me cry endlessly. Through a few months time span I probably sent $400. This was 5 years into the relationship and I had never sent money before then. That was really stupid. 

I tried to motivate D. I started research on employment centers and services. I sent things to him and he got mad. He had a job now, didn‚Äôt I think that was enough? I said I was proud of him. I was happy for him. But I wanted more for him, I didn‚Äôt want there to ever be a potential of D going back to being jobless and homeless. He deserves better then that. 

Fast forward a few months and D dumps me (the beginning of this month) because he ‚Äúis never going to move‚Äù I am broken. But if you love me D you will come. But that makes you a hypocrite D said. But I told you I couldn‚Äôt move when we started dating. You said you would. You said you wanted to. D says he loves me. But he dumps me. there‚Äôs nothing I can do about it. He doesn‚Äôt care that I was crying. He didn‚Äôt care when I got angry. But that‚Äôs because he never cared in the first place. I can‚Äôt talk to you anymore D, it hurts me too much. Okay he says and messages me 2 days later. D wants to be friends. I can‚Äôt be friends with you I‚Äôm in love with you. Please leave me alone. We fight more this time we talk. He loves me he says. 

I know I‚Äôm not completely innocent. I know I put my worth in D. His fake form of love and attention would make me feel good about myself. I felt safe but I wasn‚Äôt. I did put up a fight towards the end of our relationship. I kept calling him out on the bullshit hoping he would address it and stop. I always believed in love. Love fixes everything. If you love each other you will treat each other right. Right?

I wanted to go back, I wanted to keep talking. I looked at a lot of his social media... he happens to be talking to many of the girls his ‚Äúbrother‚Äù cheated on me with. As if I needed more proof it was him and not his twin. Which tbh I really did. 

I‚Äôm trying to be okay. I‚Äôm trying to let go completely. Look at how he hurt me, why wouldn‚Äôt I just leave? why do I still care? why do I keep him on ignore but still check to see if he‚Äôs messaged me? why do I still log into his accounts to see what he‚Äôs doing? Why am I scared of him coming back and apologizing? Why do I want him to? Why do I know he‚Äôs bad logically but still want him? 

Oh and I know hes now messaged every single girl he swore to me he wasn‚Äôt interested in. every. single. one. 6 so far. 

I think part of me wants him to come back and tell me I‚Äôm worth it. worth more than all the shit he did to me. I want him to tell me I didn‚Äôt deserve it.

Anyone actively battling an addiction will tell you that if you cut the battle down from forever to just one day at a time, it is achievable.

Everyone who‚Äôs engaged in addictive behavior will experience uncomfortable cravings at one point or another during recovery. One day or one year into the journey, it can happen. As an addict it is always good to be aware of your feeling. One‚Äôs behaviors can change on a dime when cravings are creeping in.

**SOME GENERAL BEHAVIORS TO BE AWARE OF**

* Preoccupying thoughts about the substance of choice
* A desire to return to old using spots or see old using friends.
* Wanting to use drugs or alcohol when something reminds you of them.
* Buying substance-related paraphernalia.

As mentioned in previous blogs I am grateful to be a sober alcoholic today, just one day at at time and only one day at a time. If I keep that mind set and realize that if I am having a day where I am thinking back to when the drinking was fun, I try to stop the dangerous thinking and tell myself that the thoughts will pass, and eventually they always do.

**I have a difficult time being positive**, despite the happy face people see everyday. An addictive personality and being bipolar can be challenging obstacles, but I know that the more I try to be positive the better I become at it. And in turn I have had less and less cravings as the years pass. Make no mistake, I feel that cravings may be a battle I will always face, but if I can get through them they have never lasted more than a day, and I know if I ride out the storm tomorrow is a new day.

The hard truth is that the odds are stacked against us addicts with regards to relapse. According to the **National Institute on¬†Alcohol¬†Abuse and¬†Alcoholism**, up to 90% of¬†alcoholics¬†will have at least one relapse during the first four years after they get sober. However, the way a¬†recovering alcoholic¬†handles a relapse is key to their long-term sobriety. **This is why I feel that positive thinking is everything.**

I have stumbled many times along my journey of recovery, it is the guilt and shame that had always been my road block to my recovery. I still live with the guilt and shame everyday of my life, but I also try to realize that my past does not define who I am.

An old timer with more years of sobriety than years I had been alive once told me after I had relapsed, **‚Äúpick yourself up, dust yourself off and remember tomorrow is a new day.‚Äù** I wanted to tell him off, until the following day, when I woke up. He was right. the sun rose and life went on. It was up to me to accept this fresh start as a gift. I was sober and it was day one. I have had several day ones in my life, but I picked up tools and lessons from every one of these hard experiences.",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.53694355}"

I have been having a lot of trouble finding casual sex partners over the past several years. While I have managed to have a number of sexual encounters over the past since I turned 21. Among these have included:- going out to a bar and picking up a 37 year old, which turned into a FWB relationship which lasted over a month.

\- making out and fingering a 30 something year old at a fetish party.

\- making out and fingering a 40 something year old who approached me late at night while I was walking home asking for a ride home (the police confiscated her car + keys).

\- going out to three $NZ100 swingers parties of mostly $40+ year old.

\- meeting a 31 year old at another fetish party and meeting up  for sex at a later date.

\- going to a $100 sex party in another city filled with 20-30 something year olds.

\- a couple of average $100 sex parties with 3 of the same women for both times.

&#x200B;

I have not been able to have casual sex via dating apps and approaching women in a variety of scenarios. I started to become proactive with dating when I was 20 year old when I discovered the 'seduction community'. While I did drastically improve my social intelligence and communication from gaining useful skills from the community, I became disillusioned with certain members and figures in the community and chose to not actively affiliate with it. I chose to instead seek advice from the sex positive feminist and polyamory and incorporate the best of \[non-toxic and non-specious\] advice from the seduction community. I have managed to have a good deal of dates over the years. However although I have managed to get a several makeouts from dates over the years, I haven't had any successful hookups.

There was one occasion back in 2016 for example, when I made out with a 26 year old at the end of the date and she declined to see me afterwards because she felt ""needed to work on herself"". There was another date from that same year who declined to see me due to 'busyness'. An 18 year old Chilean English language student was fine with me making out with her but wasn't ready for sex (due to inexperience). Generally speaking, the reasons I don't end up hooking up with dates have mostly to do with time constraints (a lot of the women I date are tourists) as well as at times, due to lack of chemistry or interest (from either me or her).

My sex drive is pretty damn high, so back in 2017, this led me to seek out sex workers. Initially, this was for the sake of curiosity but over the past 3 years, this has spiraled upwards in spending. In 2017 I saw a total of 22 workers and spent a total of $1,760. In 2018 I saw a total of 19 workers and spent a total of $1,940. Last year I saw 19 workers and spent a ghastly $3,710 dollars. So far this year, I have see four sex workers and I have spent a total of $760 so far. I feel it is spiraling out of control so far that I am need of serious help and guidance.

The reasons behind this includes the following factors:

1. lack of sexual encounters though dating (obvious at this point)
2. my high sex drive
3. a sexual curiosity for demographics of women I do not normally encounter when cold approaching in public or online dating. This includes very busty women (I am a breast fetishist), a well as black/brown women of colour.

Over the past year I have attempted to use $100 sex parties as a means of 'quelling' my spending on escorts (which can be more expensive). They are however very infrequent and the weekly single guys night's party I went to last year at my local swingers club was fairly average.. I have attempted to limit my spending on escorts to the bare minimum (I started out making $80 30 minute bookings) and do that in conjunction with sex parties. Both of these options have not worked. In my opinion, cutting sex workers from my life is going to an extremely difficult option and unless if I am finding an regular avenue for sex, whether that be sex parties, hooking up and starting relationships, my seeking out of sex workers are not going to wane any time soon.

There are however a few solutions that I am currently considering that may help:

1. Going to bed without my phone so I am not casually browsing sex worker listings in bed
2. Refrain from browsing on my phone in public so I am not casually browsing sex worker listing.
3. Move out of my parent's place and eventually move off government welfare. I am in my final year of university and since, I have used the excuse of study and practice for not moving out.
4. Start paying off my student loans.
5. Talk this over with a councilor or some kind of mentor.

However I need to know whether these are sound steps to take and whether there are more steps that I need to take in order to mitigate the 'need', 'urge' or 'curiosity' to seek out sex workers.

I'm sorry if this is a long post but as a 27 year old male I have found reddit to be a sanctuary for me since I was 19. Reddit was that person whom I adored but could never muster up the courage to approach. I lurked, I even flirted with the idea of posting on some sports subreddits. But those were the good days in my relationship with reddit. Today as someone who has never reached out for help I am truly desperate. My heart is broken, my soul is tortured and my future is in jeopardy. Dear reddit community, please help me. I come from an impoverished family who risked it all to make it to this country which makes this even more painful for me. If I was an addict in the nation by parents were born in, I'd be dead. However, as a first generation college student in my family I made it from the depths of poverty to graduating from UC Berkeley in Political Science. I'm no better or worse but I sacrificed everything, this country gave me an opportunity to prove my will and my desire through education. I was given a battlefield where all other factors were meaningless, merit was key. 

Today, as I lay in bed 13 days sober and completely dead inside and out, the pain of everything I built being destroyed before my very eyes is otherworldly. In the span of 2 years I went from having foot surgery to being a full blown addict in Los Angeles with nothing left. I first took an opiate when I returned home from college and although I no longer had access to them after my post surgery cycle, I was able to obtain adderall and the rest feels like a flash. When I stopped 13 days ago I had been taking adderall for almost 2 years intermittently and looking for anything I could get my hands on to sleep. This can't be real, all I ever wanted was to teach History and give back to the country that saved my life. To the next generation of youth that without the opportunity I was given, would be relegated to the doldrums of history. Believe it or not, I loved education so much that I'm mourning that loss more than the damage I've inflicted on my family, on my body an on my soul. My thoughts are scattered, my pain is deserved but I just want help. I didn't sleep for 6 days when i stopped, the stress on my family caused my 65 year old mother to get into an accident. I had never seen my father cry before. I saw that too. I don't know if I deserve life any longer for what I've done but if reddit can be the one thing I gain instead of lose from this nightmare, I'd be forever grateful. If there is any help out there for trash like me, I can only promise that if I make it out of this grave I'll spend the rest of my days paying it forward.


Edit: I've tried cardio twice a day until I'm physically drenched in sweat. For a few moments thereafter, I get some respite. I also bought some kratom which is helping me focus on daily tasks but the medical community is not necessarily a fan of kratom. I think I've decided to battle this from a psychiatric perspective. I can't trust myself with my own recovery. Lastly, I felt an overwhelming sense of community after my first post on reddit and although I'm still green at learning how to properly use reddit, I've tried responding to everyone and I truly am motivated because of your support.",56,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6728537}"

Am I doing this right?

Not sure if anyone is still here...

Firstly, I'm struggling with step 3, the higher power thing. I used to be a christian, and whilst I still have some beliefs around there being a ""God"" and prayer helping my mind if doing nothing else, I don't think I feel comfortable using something I don't KNOW that I believe in as my higher power. Russel Brand talks about his being ""energy"" and ""nature"" and so on. That's too intangible for me. I have thought of trying to use my wife's love for me, but she's on the verge of leaving me so there is a fear that rug will be pulled from under me. As I was sat playing with my daughter this morning she started giggling at me and I thought ""Ah HA! That's my higher power, my daughters joy for me""... but what does that mean? ***I turn over my will and my life to my daughters joy... [in fact... now I've written that down... it kind of makes sense... Am I on the right track here]***

I think of myself as a fairly intelligent, well educated person but I just cannot get what this higher power should feel like to me. I've read it can be a football team or a cartoon character or someone you look up to... but that all seems a bit farcical. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Bumps on the road to recovery,"I just wanted to share a little of my story with somebody. Something I need to say. I‚Äôm a recovering addict. I have been sober now over 2 years. Three years ago I decided I‚Äôd  had enough. I‚Äôd been addicted to opiates since my teen years, (the byproduct of constant migraines and a script happy Dr)I ended up physically addicted at 15. That‚Äôs how it started anyway. 

Now a lot happened in those years of using but that‚Äôs story. So after around 20years of using, I hit my breaking point and decided to get help. I spent almost a year in treatment but had to be discharged early due to medical reasons. About 3 months after I got out my mother passed away after a long battle with a blood clotting disorder. Yep! You guessed it! I relapsed. After I lost another 8 months to addiction, I managed to pull myself together so I could keep my promise to my Mama and started clawing my way out again.

 I enrolled in a methadone clinic and buckled down to get my life straight. I got a steady job, a car and I started seeing a guy I had known for years. It was an amazing time. I felt like I was finally on the way to having a normal happy life and that this was what life was supposed to be like all along! For the first time in my life I was excited about my future. 

My boyfriend  was wanting to move to Florida before we even got together and he invited me to come as well. I can‚Äôt tell you how stoked I was! We lived in Alaska at the time and I have pretty much lived in cold states all my life. I always wanted to move where it had warm weather and sunny beaches, also I was head over heels in love with him so why the hell not? (I should mention that he has a teen son, it is relevant later in the story). Anyway I had multiple conversations with him before the move,  because of my addiction issues I was still baffled that anyone would want a life with me. I asked if he was sure he wanted me to come, to which he always said that he did. 

After months of hard work and packing we finally make the move. As soon as we got to Florida though, his attitude and demeanor started changing.....(y‚Äôall can prob guess where this is headed). I got a job about a week after we arrived as a housekeeper at a local hotel. I knew something was up but he kept saying everything was fine so I tried to convince myself of that. 

Then one day about a week and a half in to my new job, he was driving me to work and informed me that he didn‚Äôt love me and just wanted it to be him and his son. I was crushed! I had just moved almost 5000 miles and spent every last dime I had to start a life with this guy and 3 weeks in, he is throwing me away?! I didn‚Äôt know anyone in Florida and had nowhere to go. I was a pitiful wreck for weeks. I decided I wasn‚Äôt going to let this destroy me and I ended up finding and renting a room, then buckled down to try to make a life for myself in Florida. 

I worked really hard at the hotel and made it to the front desk. Learning the ropes of every department from Front desk to maintenance, I threw myself in to my job. My manager (we will call him D) was talking a lot about my future in the company, him wanting to train me up to be in management one day ect.... until one day I accidentally knocked over a sharps container. It was faulty so all the needles spilled out on the floor. 
I was trying to be extremely careful while picking them up but still managed to stick myself. 

That led to a workman‚Äôs comp claim and a Dr visit. Well D decided to require a UA. (Remember I said I was going to a methadone clinic)? Now I knew D had a very low opinion of addicts. He made derogatory comments all the time about guests that were suspected of using or just looked like they would. Due to this I was terrified of him finding out I was a recovering addict and did everything in my power to keep it secret but now I had to give a UA.  I. Was. Terrified! Thought for sure going to be fired. I figured the best thing to do would be to get ahead of it. I thought if I told him before the results came back that it would be better. So I told him hoping to salvage my job. He didn‚Äôt react much but said something along the lines of we will pretend you never told me this which relieved me somewhat. I still had my job! It was all going to be ok! 

Nope. Everything changed. All of a sudden I couldn‚Äôt do anything right. I got really sick and had to call in and he made out like I called in all the time. It was only the second time in a year! He wrote me up for things but not other employees. If I made a mistake he‚Äôd harp on it for days. He cut my hours so I was having a really hard time making ends meet. There was no more talk about me moving up in the company or future management positions. 

About when things were starting to go sour  one of our regulars at the hotel (we will call him EW) had been asking me if I‚Äôd work with his 24 yo autistic son up in Indiana. I had a great rapport with his son who is a wonderful young man whenever they came to the hotel. So He wanted to hire me as a live in caregiver. I wanted to stay in Florida where it‚Äôs warm so I always kind of laughed it off but he was persistent so I started talking to him on the phone to get to know him and the situation with his son better. After a couple of months of talking. I decided to go up there for a week to visit and check it out. EW told me to just quit my job and move to Indiana. If I decided I didn‚Äôt like it, no hard feelings and he‚Äôd pay me $5000 to hold me till I was able to find another job.I wasn‚Äôt wanting to do that so I decided to go up for a week to visit and see how things went. 

Well I WASNT intending to quit my job. A week before I‚Äôm supposed to go to Indiana, I show up to work and D calls me in his office. He informs me that he is writing me up AGAIN for something that EVERY SINGLE Front Desk Associate there does frequently but only I was getting written up. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and I quit. Thinking in the back of my head that I had a job in Indiana or at least the $5000 for cushion that he promised since I had now quit my job. Looking back I wish I hadn‚Äôt been such a hot head and quit but we will just chalk that up to the MANY mistakes I have made. 

When I get to Indiana everything is ok the first day or so. Then one morning I wake up to him in my bed kissing on me. I flipped out. He apologized and said he understood when I laid out exactly what I was and WASNT there for. If I had had enough money at the time, I would have bought a ticket home the next day but as it was I was stuck there until my return trip.  He didn‚Äôt listen. The entire week he tried to get me to sleep with him even to the point of begging. Telling me he only has 3 months to live and that he‚Äôll marry me and leave everything to me and his son, all I have to do is sleep with him. I honestly thought about it. I‚Äôd never have to worry about money again but I‚Äôd never be able to live with myself after. The shame I felt from just considering it was enough. I felt hunted the entire week. 

It was coming time for me to leave and he wanted me to go to Florida pack my stuff and come back. I didn‚Äôt argue about it, I just let him think that. I sacrificed half of the clothes I brought cause I was just trying to get through my time there safely and figured it was safer if he thought I was coming back. 

When I finally got back to Florida and I informed him that I wasn‚Äôt coming back because of his behavior, he refused to pay the money he promised. He told me that I was just a piece of shit junkie and that I threw away the first half of my life and trash should stay thrown away. He said I should have just given it to him because nobody else will ever want me.  He texted my sister and told her I stole money from him to buy drugs and crap like that. 

So now I‚Äôm unemployed and back to square one but throughout ALL of this I have not relapsed. I have actually been on a taper these last 2 years and I‚Äôm almost off. I started out at 90mg and I have tapered down to 20mg. I have made many mistakes in the last 2 years but I‚Äôve kept my promise to myself and my Mama. I‚Äôm struggling.

I won‚Äôt let them destroy me and I won‚Äôt let these people make me feel like I belong in the hole I just scraped & clawed my way out of. Yes. I am a recovering addict. That does not make my life any less important, meaningful, impactful or worth less than anyone else‚Äôs. I‚Äôm still fighting! It‚Äôs been tough and it‚Äôs probably going to get tougher but I know I can stay sober through it. I never thought I‚Äôd be able to say that.

Today I got a message that he is hooked on the same drug I was for so long. 
So here is my message to him 

You were once so full of life, your hobbies were abound and you had the kind of smile that could make anyone around you feel happy. I didn‚Äôt even hear your voice or see your face but I could feel your despair in the way you spoke to me.
You mentioned you looked into rehab, and I want to tell you that it will probably save your whole life, your relationship, and might even bring your happiness back slowly but surely.
Your girlfriend has the same problem, you showed me a picture of her and I can see how beautiful she is, this problem you two share will take that away from her if she lets it. She‚Äôs beautiful...you are beautiful 
You are both still here on earth with us and you can both take steps to fix this, I know you can, I did. 
At my lowest it felt like the world was going to take me and turn me into some kind of goblin that was greedy for drugs. I felt like my arms and legs and head were made of meth and that was what my blood was.
I know how you feel...I know how scared you are and how hard it is to pick yourself up without that stuff that feels like it‚Äôs your life source, but it‚Äôs really the murderer here honey.
This stuff will take your happiness, your ability to think, your spirit, your religion, it will take you from your family and it will put you in your head, alone, no matter who is around. 
If you keep doing this you will die, and you will not be able to smile ever again. You won‚Äôt be with your beautiful girlfriend and you will never get to see the light that was your life or the light that could be your life.
Things will change once you‚Äôre sober, you won‚Äôt feel like you did before you started drugs, but you will feel like you. The new and improved you...we need you. We need you here with us to bring us smiles and laughs and to teach us how you overcame your addiction, to teach us how you came back to life.

You broke my heart today. I am not ashamed or disappointed in you, but I pray that tomorrow you wake up and decide to be yourself again. That you wake up with a sense of hope that makes you want to be your own best friend once again.

You can. I know you can.


And this goes for every other addict who reads this. You‚Äôre beautiful, if no one else, including yourself, doesn‚Äôt see your beauty, you are beautiful to me. I want you to show the world

It started when she asked our father to help her inspect her electrical outlets and light fixtures for hidden cameras and fiber optic cables. He didn‚Äôt know has to deal with the situation and ended up playing along with the inspection. Then a few weeks later our mother was visiting her (our parents have been split since she was born and they don‚Äôt speak so she didn‚Äôt know about the outlet ordeal). M noticed S was looking around her house almost desperately while M and her boyfriend were sitting on the couch with my niece (3). M‚Äôs boyfriend noticed he had sit on something and then realized it was a bag with what he told me later looked like icy crystals. M inexplicably gave the bag to S and asked her about it. S deflected and nothing else was said about it. When I eventually get these two stories from my parents I started working to bring my parents together to plan an intervention. This took too long and S‚Äôs situation worsened. Before we could do the intervention S was found by police on the side of the road after she had pulled over on some out of the way county road. She had her daughter in her car seat and was passed out in the driver seat. The deputy said that it was clear they had been sitting there a while and that it was around 5 am when he showed up. The result was felony child endangerment, resisting arrest and some other charges I don‚Äôt fully recall. Human services gets involved and the baby is taken and put into the car of my father and step mother. That happened in July and my sister still has not faced those charges in court and my dad still has temporary custody, so at least the child is safe. 

Since then we have all tried to talk to S about rehab and getting help but she has refused and denied everything since day one. According to her she has never been on drugs and the whole thing is a big conspiracy against her. Any time I talk to her on the phone she will act like everything is completely normal in her life until I bring up these issues and she will start to accuse me of being an imposter pretending to be her brother. The entire situation is hard to confront. To top it off she divorced her husband one month after the arrest and is now homeless. Several family members including cousins have tried taking her in and one even got her a job at the nursing home she works at. But she failed the pee test. Of course that too was a conspiracy and the administer of the test tampered with it. She has burned many bridges and is sitting in county jail right now for contempt of court in a completely different charge unrelated to the original arrest. She has been in there a week now because this time the bail bondsman won‚Äôt even get out because she skipped on her last bond. I feel horrible making her sit in jail because I know that county jail is a horrible place to have to sober up and that there are no programs in place to help these inmates beyond the bare minimum. The problem is if I get her out of jail I know she still won‚Äôt go to rehab. Right now the plan is to let her stay in jail for a month or so before any of us go visit. Then we will offer to get her out if she will sign herself into treatment. I don‚Äôt know if this is the right thing or not, but it‚Äôs the only thing I can think to do at this point. I could really use some advice on this.

Update: My sister ended up getting out jail after a week. She couldn‚Äôt pay the fine so she was given work to pay it off. Mom let her stay with her and after two days of sister being out of jail she disappeared for a day and showed back up tweeked out and beat up mom... again. Now she is back to the streets.

I am very functional, my relationships with friends, family, and partners all function properly, I work a job, I go to school, everyone sees my drinking as a quirk because that's what I let it on to be.

Every night I try to stay home and be sober but I start to feel an overwhelming feeling of FOMO (fear of missing out) if I don't get some booze and end my night at a bar. 

I am personable with the many regulars I've gotten to know at the many bars in my neighborhood but every night ends in tears at home alone. I've looked into AA but the religious aspect keeps me away. At least that's what I tell myself, but every other alternative addiction group gives me a bad vibe too. Maybe out of fear. 

My family doesn't know how much I drink because alcoholism runs in the family and I don't want to scare them or disappoint them if I can't get better. 

I don't know why I'm writing this, maybe it's because I'm alone and drunk at 3am with no one to talk to yet I continue to drink whatever I have available to me at home.

Smart people tell us that certain habits - called keystone habits - are more powerful than others.  They're like cheat codes for people who want to change their behaviors. If you are trying to begin or sustain your recovery, I'd encourage you to choose a keystone habit for the next week.

Charles Duhigg, author of *Power of Habit*, popularized the idea of **keystone habits**:  *small changes or habits that people introduce into their routines that unintentionally carry over into other aspects of their lives*.

Examples of keystone habits include making your bed ([see this famous commencement address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxBQLFLei70)), exercising in the morning, sleeping eight hours, or daily prayer/meditation.  These habits, which can be accomplished with a few small changes to our routine, inevitably impact all of our other daily habits.  When you make your bed, for example, you start your morning with a small accomplishment, and this will encourage you to continue notching small victories throughout the day.  And, in the words of Admiral McRaven, ""if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made ‚Äî that you made ‚Äî and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.""

For me, my keystone habit is writing about my recovery online in the morning.  In order to write, I need to have eaten a healthy breakfast and had my first cup of coffee.  I also need to wake up early enough to have time to write before starting my work, which means that I need to go to sleep at a reasonable time.  And, in writing I am not only accomplishing a small goal (#winning), I'm also supporting my recovery by engraining ideas that I'm sharing.  Focusing on achieving this one habit is empowering all of my other habits.

What's your keystone habit?  Maybe you have one, or maybe you want to choose one to try for the next week.  Comment below to share your wisdom and experience!

You can do this!  You're not alone!

# Addicted To ""More""

 

Addiction involves craving for something with the utmost intensity, loss of control over its use, and continuing involvement with it despite adverse repercussions.

Addiction comes in hundreds of forms. Not just drugs and alcohol. Food, sex, work and gambling are also common addictions in our society.

Everyone‚Äôs brain is wired differently. That is what makes use different and unique. If one in ten Americans abuse drugs or alcohol, would it be safe to say that 10% of us are wired for over indulgence in general. **I believe** **some of us are simply addicted to ‚Äúmore.‚Äù**

Everyday I watch random people sipping on their morning coffee. One and done, and they are ready for the day. I am the type of person that drinks my coffee fast, already thinking about the next cup. Or I buy three energy drinks instead of one, just because I can. The more alert I become the more alert I strive to be. Stimulants are a large part of the addiction game, however to my knowledge coffee does not wreck lives like the use of drugs and alcohol.

As a society we are programmed to over reach, over extend, and over indulge, however 10% of us do not have the automatic shut of button that the other 90% of us do. Most people know when to shut it off without giving it another thought.

For an addict there is nothing better than being sober, but having a healthy fear of the next drink, or drug of choice can be a good thing. For me daily flash backs of experiences I would rather forget, help me to stay in check for the next 24 hours. Everyone is different, but fear sometimes works for me.

Having a mental illness that coincides with addiction can be a double edge sword. Often times my mind races with manic thoughts, and once in awhile I think of how a few drinks would quiet my thoughts. If I try hard enough to think back on how things got when I chose that route I can win the battle knowing that the racing thoughts will eventually subside, and there will be no damage done because I didn‚Äôt pick up the first drink.

I believe most people with addictive personalities can surely go on to live a great life, often it may work to their advantage while having minimal consequences on the other facets of their lives.

The ‚Äúaddicted to more‚Äù concepts can be very dangerous, if it is not kept in check. Being addicted to more of anything that alters your brain or the way you feel, from something as small as energy drinks or food can become problematic. Running in constant overdrive or gaining weight can affect ones life negatively in many different ways as you may imagine.

These examples cannot be compared to drugs or alcohol. But imagine a life where everything you do from drinking coffee in excess or working out constantly must be self monitored and kept in check, simply because **it is an exterior action that heightens pleasure and effect in one way or another and your brain craves more of it because you are wired differently.**

Knowing you are this type of person can be half of the battle, but it is still just that. A battle. There is a good chance that there is at least one person you know lives ‚Äúaddicted to more‚Äù of anything and you may have no idea. Or you are that person. Either way it is important to keep in mind that we are all family ,friends, co workers,and peers trying to live our best lives one day at a time

I‚Äôm going to post this on the r/quittingkratom forum too. Basically I have 15 years of abusing drugs which started with about 5-6 years of pretty impressive adderall abuse. At one point towards the end of my adderall days I was taking over 120mg/day. I simply couldn‚Äôt stop without losing my job as I was worthless because of what it does to your motivation system. I was also drinking heavily and abusing Benzos. I then discovered kratom. I thought it was a miracle substance. I got off adderall easily and also quit drinking. Of course addiction is a progressive disease so I started up on other drugs in addition to kratom like Ritalin and occasional benzo abuse. Right now I‚Äôm SEVERELY addicted to kratom. Like upwards of 100grsms a day which is INSANE. I‚Äôm dropping $60 a DAY on this habit. I just went to kaiser and told my psychiatrist EVERYTHING. He referred me to an addiction doctor who recommended suboxone. I‚Äôm hesitant to trade one addiction for another...but the statistics seem stacked against me. Anyone have any thoughts on getting on suboxone for a near decade long relationship with extensive doses of kratom?

2020-02-20 08:10:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/f6suju/daily_action_step_stop_trying/,Daily Action Step - Stop Trying?,"Hey friends,

Is it possible that the one thing keeping you from healing is that you are trying too hard?

Hear me out.  David Brooks writes in *The Road to Character* that St. Augustine was only able to heal from his disordered approach to love when he stopped believing that he could accomplish his own healing.  Brooks writes:  **""The problem, Augustine came to believe, is that if you think you can organize your own salvation you are magnifying the very sin that keeps you from it""** (Brooks, 199).  According to Brooks, Augustine realized he would only find wholeness only after ""a renunciation of the very idea that he could he the source of his own solution"" (Brooks, 201).

Consider that for a moment.  If you're anything like me, you have treated your addiction as a problem to be solved by sheer force of will - through rigorous self-discipline, seeking professional help, enlisting the support of friends and accountability partners, and any number of things we do to right the ship of our lives.  What Brooks is arguing is, at first read, offensive.  We work really hard to heal, and you suggest that we've got it backwards?

But I think Brooks would say, yes, we've got it backwards.  How can we, who have proven our inability to cultivate healthy habits , muscle our way back into an ordered and life-giving relationship to our addictive behaviors?  This seems prideful, and misguided.  Instead, Brooks writes that Augustine, thought a famously ambitious person, nestled his work and effort in complete surrender to God.  ""He came to conclude that the way to inner joy is not through agency and action, it's through surrender and receptivity to God"" (Brooks, 204).

I continue believe that our efforts to heal from addition matters.  Those efforts have mattered in my life.  But the wisdom of Augustine is that we are likely to fail if we believe that we can just will or work ourselves back into wholeness.  We must be humble enough to surrender to that true Love who brings order and healing to all.

**Do Today**:  In one of the actions that you take today to support your healing (talking with an accountability partner, reading about addition, eating heather, exercising, etc.) say this simple prayer:  *God, I surrender my life into your hands.  I give you the wheel.  Captain my ship into the healing waters of your love.*  Or something like that prayer.  And, if you're not religious, allow yourself to ponder the possibility that you alone may not have the power to heal yourself.

You can do this.  And, you are not alone!

I've ran out of NJoy pods, and I was going to get a ride to a sheetz to pick up more but they didn't have enough gas. 

A normal person would have understood. I didn't. 

The initial denial hit at around 4:30pm. 

I have fought and fought and fought over the phone trying to get money for gas so I could get my stupid pods so I could avoid withdrawals. Eventually I got my sister to loan me 10 dollars through PayPal, and I'm about to leave my house now. Its 9:30pm. 

Now, part of me is satisfied with my success. The anxiety in me however now realizes the amount of difficulty I've caused everyone in my damn family just for a hit. The person driving me, who is 72, is willing to do it. But she's tired and I didn't begin to think about that during the pushing or the fighting. 

I don't currently live with my family either. I live for free with a friend and his family because otherwise I'd be homeless. I eat their food, I sleep in their home, and they don't ask me for a dime. All they want is to see me graduate. They're truly a second family to me. And I've pushed them past their limit, all for a hit. All for a buzz. 

My body hurts. Depression set in when I realised the true nature of my addiction and just how fucked I am. I'm not only hurting myself but I'm also hurting the people that care about me. What I'm doing is abusing their care. I'm becoming mentally abusive, and I hate myself for it.

Mum's boyfriend won a hearty amount of money on the pokies machines and decided to leave us (forgot to mention my mum has a snapped ankle so she can't work and hoddles around on crutches) in a house we can't afford without a cent without telling us where he was untill he was in a different state (I'm currently in Victoria he ran away to Queensland). Within 4 days I managed to quit the job I had, spent my first pay from that job (a little over $1000) in a matter of hours on methamphetamine, managed to hide that from mum untill my Centrelink pay came in and that too was spent in 2 maybe 3 hours.

I always needed alcohol too ""fit"" in, well  I did exactly the opposite, but I was drunk, so who the fuck cares right. 

I learned a lot about how addiction works and why I use, but it didnt solve shit. It only made it worse. On top of that I got diagnosed with stuff. A little information flyer and off you go. 

Sometimes the psychs even said I didnt have that disorder, I must have had an off day. Do they realise what the impact on someone is by saying he is a borderliner, but maybe he had on off day so maybe not? When I ask people for help they tell me too live the 12 steps. So thats it? The 12 steps or die. What a nice future. Im as atheist as it gets. I hate god and evwrything that comes with it. I dont believe in ghosts or a force.

I've lived in a car/van for 3 years. I'm now 29. Original intent for it was to create a self sustained income where I could travel full time. Unfortunately I was drinking and taking kratom before I moved into my car so that obviously never happened. Drinking got worse and I basically have done nothing but work, pay bills, go off and on into debt, and waste time on my phone for 3 years. Eventually I began to realise that the real reason I moved into a vehicle was so that I could stay irresponsible and self indulge. 95% of my time not working (and even working now.) is me sitting in my vehicle, stuck outside of reality, either on my phone or mindlessly in my head staring off into space. I no longer drink but this is still my reality. 

It's been 3 years almost out here. During this time I've worked overnights and slept during the day. Summers have been literal hell. I now make more money then I've ever made in my life in the last 3-4 months. I will be closer to $40-$50k/yr compared to $20k/yr if I continue. This has not helped me because just the thought of looking for a place to live and potentially having to have a roommate is super overwhelming. Not to mention the stress of having to pay rent again or having a place but with absolutely no furniture. I'm homeless but I still currently have about $1200/month or more in expenses as well. I've never been able to save money or budget myself. Everytime I try and start theoretically spending my money I get a ton of anxiety and my brain freezes up. But then I just go and blow it on self indulgences like fast food and whatever addiction thats around at the time.

I haven't cut my hair in 6 months or more and is damaged beyond repair. I've always been through these cycles of not cutting my hair and then cutting when it gets too bad but it's getting worse. I've never known what to do with it and get a lot of anxiety about getting a haircut.

Recently I'll go 3-5 days without showering, using baby wipes only, because every time I go to the gym I shower at, the supposed ""Judgment Free Zone"", I'm judged to hell and back and am talked about negatively and seen as super weird and given weird looks. In all honesty I have become a very weird person compared to who I used to be. Granted I was never particularly ""normal"" but my weirdness has grown to new heights in these 3 years. Just walking into the gym gives me anxiety and severely depressive negative thoughts towards myself for the rest of the day and sometimes days to come. So instinctively I avoid it even if that means I may smell somewhat bad if you get too close for a few days. No one gets close enough anyways usually. 

I go days barely eating anything. Like today Ive had like 4 slices of bread and two large cups of coffee. Then other days I'll eat fast food twice a day and over eat. I've gained 40-50 lbs in 6 months. When I'm working I'll eat fast food. When I'm not I'll hardly eat a thing and sit in my vehicle all day till 7am in the morning when I go to bed. I have a two burner stove and an ice chest but the cooking, cleaning, and storing process can take super long. Most days I barely have the energy to go shower much less do all it takes to cook and clean. 

I'm currently in a position where I could potentially get a place soon. But it still feels far away and like I'll never escape this reality. I don't know if i have the strength and will it takes to get out. I'm weak spiritually, mentally, emotionally, relationally, and physically. I know something is extremely wrong with me but all the psychology searching and reflection I've done has me running in constant circles. I have no friends and my family is either dead, have disowned me, or left me behind.

Is this depression, anxiety, addiction, or something much deeper and worse?

It is common for people who suffer from a substance use disorder to also have an underlying mental health disorder, such as depression or anxiety. These disorders and others such as post-traumatic stress disorder are not a reflection of personal weakness, lack of willpower, or poor moral character; they are a disease, like addiction. If you are diagnosed with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, PTSD, or another disorder, remember that you are not responsible for the disorder. You are, however, responsible for getting help. You don't have to suffer; there are effective treatments that can help you recover.

If you have symptoms of a mental health disorder, seek a diagnosis from a qualified person such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, or other mental health professional who is experienced in Twelve Step recovery. If you treat your mental health disorder, you will greatly improve your success with sobriety.

Action for the Day

Have you experienced thoughts of suicide or emotional difficulties that haven't lessened or that have grown worse since you began your recovery program? Describe these feelings. Talk to your sponsor and recovery group right away. Ask for a referral to a qualified mental health professional who is familiar with addiction and recovery.

Description: 

The Nutty prof begins by saying this is the follow up to the previous PC on integrating shadow and he adds the concept of ‚ÄúPOTE‚Äù to his PATAP approach to addiction (as an analogy to help understand cravings at different levels).  He also reminds viewers of the Freudian concepts of Eros and Thanatos (Life and Death instincts) from a previous podcast. 

This leads him to talk about the process of attempting to ‚Äúreconcile‚Äù other ‚Äúopposites‚Äù besides ‚ÄúEros and Thanatos‚Äù, these include forward and back, up and down, light and dark, in and out, and he also discusses other ‚Äúmetaphors‚Äù for ‚Äúmovement‚Äù like ‚Äúcircles‚Äù and ‚Äúspirals‚Äù.  He proceeds to discuss symbols and how he doesn‚Äôt take them ‚Äúliterally‚Äù and he mentions that he recently had a Tarot card reading.  

He focuses on the three cards he selected during the reading, the first was the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù card and it seems to deal with links to the community.  The second card was ‚ÄúEnemies‚Äù and deals with conflict, he discusses a conflict with a former friend (without going into a lot of details) and how at one time he‚Äôd had conflicts with his father but those issues seem resolved but he considers that conflict could also refer to the inner conflicts involved in confronting shadow/reconciling opposites.  He also shares a couple of dreams he had that seem to compliment the Tarot reading.   The most positive card was the third which suggested stresses are temporary (one needs to detach from them).  The nutty prof ends with a reference to the book ‚ÄúHeart of Darkness‚Äù (adapted into ‚ÄúApocalypse Now‚Äù) saying his goal is to be the Sheen character who returns from the journey to darkness and not the Brando character who goes mad and he says he‚Äôll keep viewers posted.

It started when I moved up from 300 mgs. It made me feel really anxious and shaky, so I went back with the normal 300 mg dose. After a while, though, I started to get tired. Like, really really tired. I was so exhausted I could barely do what I needed to do, let alone to succeed in any way. On a whim, I decided to start taking 600 mg to help.

I'm scared to go somewhere asking for strangers to validate me. I'm terrified to leave my kid and husband for rehab. I don't want to be alone. I'm not even sure who could watch her while I went. My mom is incredibly angry with me, she told me she wished she'd shit me out in the toilet. My dad isn't as harsh, but he won't say he loves me, he won't hug me and I want that so much, I feel like I'm totally alone. My husband literally got a new job 3 days ago so he can't be here for me like he was. My grandma tells me every day she loves me, but Jesus, she's 90. I feel like this cruel world is going to snatch her away at any minute. My counselor, who I've had for 5 years is also upset with me. I feel like she's given up, and if she's given up, why shouldn't I? 

I'm pregnant and scared. Why, why can't I just fucking STOP.

Don't laugh, my drug of choice is synthetic weed. It's so easy to get and so powerful. I've tried heroin and alcohol, but nothing does it like the spice.



Edit: I know my situation isn't ideal or *ok*. Why did I use while pregnant? Because I was depressed. I was deeply contemplating suicide. I know that's not OK either, but I'm telling the truth. I'm sorry if I offended you.

On the other hand, I'm convinced I need to get to treatment and I'm making my plans. I appreciate the suggestion to try SMART recovery. I'm signed up for an online group now.

The hospital where I get prenatal care offers a highly rated substance abuse IOP, but I need my doctors recommendation. I'll be seeing him in 2 days. I will follow through. I appreciate the support Reddit.

I went to AA for awhile but always relapsed because having to go to work in early days of sobriety made me realize I use or else lose my job because I‚Äôm such a mess during withdrawals or PAWS. 

I‚Äôm READY to get sober this time. I‚Äôll take a medical leave of absence and go all in. Rehab is expensive though.

Its a natural plant, it grows on its own. Drugs are made in a lab. There's nothing to worry about, you won't get addicted. You'll be able to quit any time.... Well guess what dumbass. It's a drug. And it's addicting. 

I started when I was 14. Now I'm 27. I feel like the last 13 years are a haze. I have memories, it's not like I don't remember anything that happened, but it feels like it was all just a dream, like it happened but not really. I can tell you things that happened and more or less when but recalling anything specific is very difficult to impossible.

I pretty much spent my teenage years locked in my room getting high and gaming. School? Who cares. Getting a proper job/career? Whatever, I'll manage. Being high all the time, turned me into a careless person. I stopped caring about everything. Sometimes I feel like I'm emotionless because of it. Like things I should care about or should bother me just don't faze me.

Not to mention it hasn't done anything good for me financially. I've literally been burning my money away for the last 13 years. Probably thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars by now. Literally burnt to smoke.

I always told myself this would never happen, I would never let it affect my life in such a way. I would stop when this happened or when that happened and when it did I told myself it's ok, you'll quit soon, or just finish what you have left and then you'll stop.

But here I am. I'm now 27, with a wife and a three month old kid, struggling financially and living in my father's basement because of it. I told myself when the kid came it would be the last straw. I have to get my life in order. I need to do everything I can to give this child the best life I can. And yet here I am, still smoking and lazying about any chance I get. I want to stop, I NEED to stop, but I just don't know how.

I've tried multiple times before, and just couldn't do it. I lose my appetite, after 2-3 bites of anything my stomach just won't take more and it becomes near impossible to fall asleep at night. I told myself I would smoke only at night so I can eat and sleep but it snowballs from there every time. What makes it hardest is that when I'm sober there's just this anger that comes out of me. I flip my shit over the smallest and stupidest things. I feel like I'm dying inside because I don't know what to do. I want to stop and be better but I just don't know how. 

How my wife hasn't left me yet is beyond me. I don't know what I'd do if she did. Without her support I think I'd be in a far worse place. Her and my child are everything to me. I'm just thankful everyday to still have them.

Meth and Coke mostly.  I have been clean this time for the longest I have been since then; 7 years now, and I would feel comfortable saying that it will stick for good this time.  Mostly because it wasn't just getting sober. My entire lifestyle has made a huge shift in the last 7 years. 

I know I should be happy that I have been able to get here and I should be proud of myself but if I am going to be honest I have to admit that I am not. 

Being sober sucks.   It's ungodly boring.  I miss the way I felt when I was getting fucked up. I don't know how to even explain it.  Its like everyone talks about how awesome it is once you get over the hump and how much better you feel both physically and emotionally when you get clean.  I don't know about how it is for anyone else but, for me, thats a total lie. I have been waiting 7 years to feel ""better"" but I have come to the realization it isnt going to happen. 

I miss the rush and the excitement of being high.  I miss the euphoric feeling that always comes with getting high for the first several hours afer taking a short ""break"" (like 2 or 3 days to get sleep and recharge) I miss the bond that forms with people you get high with and stay up all night with.  I miss my.life as an addict.  Yes, I was on drugs and was living an unstable life but I was happy and I had so much fun.  

Sober is...just dull as Hell.  Like Im not unhappy or going through withdrawals anymore.  But I am not truly HAPPY either.  Im just kind of here. 

No I wont be relapsing because I am sober for my kids and it will always be better for them to have me sober and what is the best for them is what is the most important thing in the world and always will be so I am done with drugs but it sucks knowing I will never have that excitement and rush ever again and that from now on I have to accept that this is what life is going to be now for good. 

I really wish the  people who had had addictions and got sober before me and were supporting me through getting clean had been honest with me.  It isn't better sober.

But, i need to know what my first step is. Do i seek therapy? AA/NA groups? Ive never been religious so how should that take in? I remember my moms AA groups being religious and that scares me off. Should i talk to my mom? She‚Äôs been sober as far as i know for about two years but i dont live in the same state as her anymore so i dont know if she‚Äôs hiding it. 

Lastly, the withdrawals from the kratom are brutal. Should i try and taper down my doses or should i quit cold turkey? Ive tried both multiple times and always relapse. I mostly take the kratom for anti anxiety which has gotten worse over the years.

Five years ago today, I stumbled into the rooms

And today I am writing to express my gratitude

My life is evidence that miracles are possible

&#x200B;

In 2015 I was 21 years old and I had had enough

Of bipolar disorder, resentment and vomit

Of broken glass, ashes and loneliness

But lacking courage to end my life

&#x200B;

So I made my first meeting, took the first step and set fire to my old self.

&#x200B;

Over the last few years the time spent in these rooms has taught me:

* When uncomfortable or stressed blank ‚ÄìBe patient. **Comfortable silence** **resides within**.
* When failing or controlling ‚Äì Accept. **Let go**. **Or you will be dragged. Friction burns.**
* When self-centered ‚Äì Humility. Every time. **Always be kind. No exceptions.**
* When the path feels hard, tread lightly. **If it‚Äôs not effortless, it‚Äôs not right.**

&#x200B;

With discipline, I have been given the courage to rebuild my life with intention

And in exchange for faith, I have been granted an existence of belonging and serenity

&#x200B;

Brothers and sisters, from love we come and to love we shall return

Blessed is each fighter that has passed and each still to come

That no addict seeking recovery should ever die

&#x200B;

And if you would like to celebrate with me today, smile.

I don‚Äôt know how to help him so I was hoping for some advice here. All our friends are getting increasingly worried about Jimmy but don‚Äôt know how to approach the situation. 

Jimmy has been ‚Äútrying to taper off‚Äù for the last 12 months however, has been bed ridden and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt have enough energy to get out of bed which means he can‚Äôt completely quit‚Äù. 

Seems like he has a cycle of excuses. Not enough energy so can‚Äôt leave house or get a hobby, needs to use cause he will be too anxious/fatigued/etc. 

Jimmy is a very smart guy (Uni graduate and worked as a professional for 5 years in his field). He has been out of work for the last 12 months to get clean, he lives with his mum and does nothing all day besides laying in bed ‚Äútapering himself off‚Äù aka using. Jimmy is self aware enough to know that he needs to get off it ASAP and how bad it is for him. 

All of our close friends have used drugs recreationally since we were 15 (mdma, lsd, Coke, flowers, etc - we‚Äôre all now now 28, professionals that occasionally still party) so we‚Äôre not completely green to how delicately something like this needs to be handled. But none of us have been addicted to something as hard as this so we don‚Äôt know how to help.

Jimmy recently told me he needs someone to hold onto his gear and ration it out to him as he can‚Äôt do it himself. This made me more concerned than ever before.

Relapsed again, with them, and I feel like he chose them and drugs over me.","My husband (34M) and I (34F) were both in recovery from heroin when we met. About a year after getting married and having a miscarriage, he relapsed and I followed. The road to getting back on track was long and difficult but we both got on Suboxone and were doing well for a substantial amount of time...

He first relapsed by ordering benzos online and then progressed back to IV H use, which is what I started back on. We both have staid off of H but he has struggled with other substances, a lot. I tend to participate using other substances when he has brought them home. The list includes, Molly, Acid, Alcohol, weed (not even a drug imo), Benzos oh and oxycodone that was sent to him by accident when he was ordering benzos online. So that whole mix of shit was going on for a while even after we went on subs. Finally I had enough and stopped everything. He continued until he got 2 DWAIs in one day and almost lost his job and eventually almost lost me. When I finally put my foot down, stopped fighting with him, got my own account and told him I love him but I can't be with him when he is using.... he stopped! 

He changed. He went back to the amazing, incredible, kind, sweet, caring, loving person he truly is. I loved that time we had together. We had even started the process for IVF because we both want a child so much. We were in the early phases as I was waiting until at least 6 months fully clean before we actually had the embryo's put in me. 

All throughout this hot mess of marriage, he has used with his friend (Jay) that he helped secure an apt. located like 200 ft. from our apt. and Jay's now live in girlfriend (I am going to name her Courtney after Courtney Love, although she makes Courtney Love seem like an angel in comparison). My relationship with Jay and Courtney is volatile as they are pure evil. I don't blame them for his relapses but they make things 1 million times worse. Husband wouldn't reveal his online sources to Jay and Courtney because he would sell to them for profit (the hustle is another one of his ""barriers to sobriety?"") even the times he wasn't using. This last time I told him he needs to completely cut ties with them if he wants me to stay. I had never given him an ultimatum like that before.

Well...Courtney has been relentless. We both had them both blocked on our phones. We had been doing great for months. Clean and so happy. But when they started getting low on drugs, there they were.  First they started texting my husband (who is a peer in substance use field) on his work phone asking him to get them shit. She is still able to leave me voicemails even when blocked on my phone. She started out leaving VMs asking if I want to go to a meeting, same days she was asking my husband to score for her. I think it's super shitty to pretend to want to go to a meeting to get back in with me so she cant get back in with him so he will hook her up with drugs. Then VMs saying if I didnt want to go to a meeting that we could go out and get ""wild"", whatever that fuck that means. Then they got progressively more angry. She would say she has been trying to call both me and husband and it goes right to VM and she just wants to know we are ok and if we don't want to be friends that's fucked up.... just on and on and on. Now, if she really was worried, we live close enough that she could walk to our st and see our cars were still gone for work everyday. 
Then they used fake numbers from those apps that create numbers. Then E-mailed my husband a bunch of times. He finally E-mailed back telling her to stop. 

And then they mailed my husband xanax pills which arrived at the same time that we had been fighting and he took them. That evening I decided not to stop at office on my way home, so got home like 45 minutes later... and he was at their apartment. I saw he was on location tracking. Called him and he didnt answer a bunch of times. I drove down to sit outside their appt in car. Called. He answered and lied and said he was walking to store. Waited until he came out of their apartment so he couldn't deny it. And that was yesterday. First he said he went down there to confront them for fucking with him, and denied being high. He was onviously high. Kept lying sbout that until this morning when he blamed them for mailing him the pills (they did mail them, saw the post marked envelope). He has been high on benzos all day today too but denys it. I know he is though, he fell asleep outside in the freezing cold, plus I just know by his voice and behavior.

My heart is broken. I thought this time was different. I thought that since he blocked them he was making huge steps in breaking free from them and drugs. I don't understand. We had so many convos about how they purposely try to get him to pick up again so he will be hooked and continue to order shit online for them and score with them. Like, how can he be friends with them and using with them when he knows they only use him?? I could never talk to people that treated me like that?!?!?

I am now printing out divorce forms. I can't do this again. He chose them and drugs over me for the last time. I have been down this road too many times. I am sad for him and sad for me and I hate them. Possibly misplacing anger on them but I don't care.

To the point of bringing shit up I'm not thinking about, I'm doing fine, and they make it all about my problems.

At first when she told me I thought, ‚Äú well maybe it‚Äôs not going to stick around and it would just be one time.‚Äù I think everyone who has an addict in the family hopes it would just be one last time , but it obviously wasn‚Äôt the last time. She‚Äôll come home smellling like alcohol already and tries to cover up the smell with mints. That almost never works because whenever I smell mints coming off her breath, it‚Äôs now trying to hide the smell. Why try and hide it ? Because she‚Äôs an addict and she doesn‚Äôt wanna admit to anyone she fell off. Here‚Äôs a little backstory; In 2014 I think , is when she had weight loss surgery. She had the gastric sleeve operation where they cut out 84% of her stomach. She ended up losing a ton of weight and the drinking wasn‚Äôt so bad . That summer of 2015 was so fucking bad . She started partying more and more with friends and now family could see it was a problem . She ended up gaining a lot of weight that summer from drinking so much . She could easily finish at this point ( after surgery remember) 2 full sleeves of fireball , a four pack of wine, beers and more on top of that. That‚Äôs exactly what she drank the night before I had to drive her to the hospital. She couldn‚Äôt keep anything down, because her liver was the size of a football, and her body didn‚Äôt want anything except liquor . Her body ended up turning yellow. She missed my first day of senior year because she was in the hospital because her habit almost killed her. And now she yells at me when I bring it up to her or try and talk to her . She gets so mad because she ‚Äú knows what she‚Äôs doing ‚Äú , she‚Äôs ‚Äúan adult‚Äù , she ‚Äú knows how much of an asshole she was she was drinking abut swears she would never be as bad again‚Äù. She yells at me almost every night, I can‚Äôt even talk to her without her getting mad at me or slurring her words . Sometimes it feels like she hates me or resents me when she‚Äôs drinking. Before she got sober , we didn‚Äôt get a long at all and then she became sober which in turn our relationship got better , but now it‚Äôs going down the tubes. I‚Äôm almost 23 and I need to get the hell out of my house . I wanna get away from her but I love her so much .... I‚Äôm scared she‚Äôs going to end up almost dyeing again, getting in a car accident because she was too drunk to drive , or just scared of the fact her heart might just stop beating ... apart of me feels better for expressing how I feel, but apart of me feels like shit . :/ now it‚Äôs just tequila shots and vodka shots of 100 proof ...

But with social media and games, it's so different. It's so easy to pick up when you're at home and have nothing to do for an hour, fast forward a month and I'm neglecting my friends hobbies and responsibilities to progress in a game, or I rather scroll through Facebook for an hour just to ""not do"" some important stuff.
I know it's dopamine related, all games nowadays are total dopamine IVs, once you start everything else feels bland and boring, and you don't progress fast enough to keep you interested. So even if I play a bit, slowly but surely I get into the game and other stuff fades to the background.
When I think of quitting cold turkey I feel immense anxiety that I will feel bored forever, but I feel guilty after spending yet another day on the bad habit. 

How do I take control of this? I don't want to quit, I want to control it, to be able to relax after a long day with an hour of gaming, and then pick up something else and actually feel good about.
Does anyone have experience with this? Do you think a dopamine detox would be something for me? Any other suggestions?

What is it that I'm doing wrong? 

I'll admit, I live in a car eight now but have a full time job. I don't have the best fashion sense and shopping for clothes stresses me out. I'm overweight. I have no clue what to do with my hair so I end up growing it out long and then getting it all cut off, rinse and repeat. I've never known what to wear or how to act or how to communicate in real life social interactions. I over share often. Ive never had many friends, right now I have none. I've been an addict/alcoholic since I was 15. My family's either passed away already or have left me because of my selfish behavior and isolating tendencies. I'm almost 30. 

I feel so unprepared for the real world. It's overwhelming all the things I still need to learn. So I find whatever escape I can. Be it drugs, alcohol, movies, social media, reddit, games, etc. Drugs are the only thing that helps to make me not care about what others in society think of me anymore.

I've been taking cannabis every day for three years now. I got a medical certificate for a seizure disease. It's currently undiagnosed, and I've had a lot of tests to rule out what it isn't, such as epilepsy, a brain tumor, etc. Cannabis helps me with anxiety, but it can't be recommended for that reason in the states I've lived in. I was prescribed opioids (Xanax) for anxiety but I don't want to get physically addicted -- I was prescribed benzos for a while and getting off them was terrible. So I opted for cannabis as the lesser of two evils-- not that I really think cannabis is evil AT ALL. In fact, it's just prejudice that has kept it federally illegal all this time. 

So now I've moved to a new city with my husband for his job and I'm looking at getting a new job. My last job was at a university, where they did not care/ trusted me to manage myself like an adult. Now I'm applying for a job at a federal lab where drug testing is mandatory and required to get a clearance which is necessary to even work there. It's kind of a dream job -- at least, the salary is a dream salary lol. So now I'm 'studying' for the test and haven't taken any cannabis for four days. 

I quit nicotine about 10 years ago before getting pregnant with my first. So, I know I can quit this thing if I want to. And I quit those benzos too.

If I were working today, it wouldn't be so hard. I'd be away from home at the co work space, applying for jobs and working on my side projects. But it's a snow day and I'm home with the kids who are off school. I'm bored off my ass and want that distraction. I'm anxious and searching for relief.  If I were alone I'd go to sleep or something to blot out the day and let time pass while my body gets used to operating without it. I can't, though, due to kids at home. (Actually, having the kids around makes it a little easier/distracty-er. If I were alone I'd probably break and smoke.)

I don't have a plan to get through the day, except minute by minute. I feel blank and sad, and I know the way to feeling better is right there in the cupboard. 

Ugh. Help me hold out. I remember from quitting nicotine that the hardest days are the third day, the third week and then by the time you get to the third month you're free.

I'm a 17 year old highschool student soon to graduate and move on to college. I'm also making music in my own home studio I've recently built for myself, working out, and working at a local bar doing dishes. I just barely pulled through highschool, as I failed my first 3 years getting F's in litterally every single class, got expelled, and fell into a dark path when I got addicted to chasing highs. Luckily, an alternative school helped me turn that all around and I'm now eligible to attend a community college and transfer to a bigger university. 

I recently just got sober, as the only thing I now consume is caffeine, which I eventually plan to quit too. Before that, it was cocaine, ecstasy, acid, marijuana, spice, alcohol, nicotine, porn. I had a pretty bad addiction to all these things. But I managed to finally get sober after 4 years of highschool and hell.

The last thing I've done was ecstasy 3 weeks ago. For some reason, ecstasy is my favorite drug out of them all. It wakes me up, makes me feel (of course) in ecstasy, went great with weed, and for some reason I would love watching porn hours and hours on end while doing lines.

Last time I did ectsasy I nearly overdosed. I managed to snort 6 very strong pills that were also laced with cocaine and other filler drugs. It was honestly the highest I'd ever been in my life. 3 days after I became a huge fiend, searching my carpet for pill residue I accidentally spilled and getting high as fuck (even though my tolerance skyrocketed very quickly). I finally kicked it on the 4th day after doing it, but life felt like hell afterwards.

Then I finally decided to quit weed, porn, and nicotine cold turkey as-well as any other drugs I tried occasionally. It's now 3 weeks since I've done ecstasy, and 1 week since being 100% sober. Life is boring as hell, but I already see myself becoming so much more productive and successful.

But I still feel empty, lethargic, and bored with life. The longest I've been sober is 1 month in the past 4 years. But luckily, I've cut out all my toxic friends.

But today, my brain is having flashbacks to doing the ecstasy. I had a dream last night about doing a shit ton again and having a huge porn binge. And I even overdosed in the dream. It was scary and blissful at the same time, and I accepted that I was about to die in my dream. Then I woke up.

But even after the overdose in my dream, I've been craving X super hard today. I keep on getting flashbacks to snorting all those pills and feeling invincible while watching hours of porn. And it makes me want to do it again. I have no cravings for any other drug besides this one. 

Shit is really f\*cking with my head. I work out and make music to help get through the cravings, but even after all this I'm still craving it pretty hard. I'm half tempted to hit up my dealer and buy a shit ton of X pills. Can someone help talk me through this or give me advice, please? I want to be sober and stay sober and be like that for the rest of my life. I'm tired of chasing highs. But my brain can't help but want one last time.",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.47323132}"

My adopted dad always made the money in the house and made it a point to not let my mom work too much or go to school. Ya know, typical abusive husband shit. After the divorce (or divorces) he never gave her child support or alimony to help her and my 4 younger sisters survive. My grandma always helped them out as my mom only had low paying jobs.

During all of this madness she developed a horrible alcohol problem. That coupled with her bipolar disorder has sent her into a tailspin. She can't hold down a job, take my sister's to school, or barely even feed them.

WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT:

Tonight a got a call from my aunt that scared me to death:

"" Have you seen your mom? Tonight she told the girls she was done with it all and that she loved them and just left. She is drunk and we can't get ahold of her.""

I thought my mom had killed herself.

Lucky we found her going 60 mph in a 25 zone three sails to the wind. She was safe and more importantly nobody else was hurt. Nobody can really afford to send her to treatment and she just lost her job last week so she doesn't have insurance. I mentioned we should sign her up for Medicaid but it turns out my adopted dad was defrauding the food stamps program in my state a few years ago and both of my parents nearly went to jail for it (I never knew that happened). That makes her ineligible for Medicaid. We think there is a short detox program at a hospital near by that we can probably get her to through the hospital financial aid program but she needs more than that.

Do you guys know of any resources that could help financially get my mom into some sort of treatment center? I am located in northern Utah if that makes a difference. 

tl;dr

My mom nearly killed herself in a alcohol and mental illness driven bender tonight. My family can't afford treatment but she needs it. Resources would be helpful.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.79339844}"

I had the money, my son was at his dads for the weekend so I had the opportunity. I was like 85% sure I was going to pick up the phone and call my dealer. I even scrolled through snap chat to see if I still had him in my friends list. 

  While scrolling on snap I accidentally swiped over to the stories list and saw my little brother had posted on his story. So I decided to go hang out with him and his girlfriend instead.

I am a Canadian male. I am 25 years old. About 3 weeks ago, I went to a massage parlour and lost my virginity to a masseuse. The following day, I went back again and had sex with another masseuse. I had been a virgin up until that point and had never ever been intimate or sexual with any other female in any way whatsoever. I never knew what sex was like and was struggling with very strong urges. I had been trying super hard to ward off the temptation to see a sex worker up until those visits but I did not succeed and gave in. I struggled with immense and deep feelings of guilt and shame after those encounters. In addition, my anxiety and OCD made everything worse and I kept obsessing about STDS (even though I was protected during both sex and blowjobs given) and obsessing and worrying about all sorts of risks. All logic flies out the window when you are obsessive-compulsive and, unfortunately, no amount of logic at the time could have quelled my irrational feelings. I had nightmares, cried, lost my appetite for food, and could not focus for most of my day. Reaching out online has helped me a lot and I now feel better and I am starting to move on with my life (I am very much thankful to reddit in this respect and the kind users who have helped me online because I could not have imagined myself talking to anyone about this; these random strangers were my heroes really and I thank them from the bottom of my heart). Up until now, I still obsess about certain things and the thoughts of what I did come back occasionally to haunt me but it is not as bad as where I was for I was in a very dark place. Even though I understand that what I did was normal and not to be ashamed of by many accounts, the feelings of guilt/shame and the worries just kept happening for some reason.

I am glad that I am moving on. However, at this point, I still deeply worry about potentially doing this again. I have not up until now. For the most part, just the knowledge of the horrible feelings of guilt/shame, and obsessive worry that will accompany any possible decision on my part to do this again have been enough to prevent me. I definitely do not want to experience what I experienced again. And that has been a strong enough bulwark. However, I have a feeling I will be struggling with sexual urges again soon. And, I hope to God I will not resort to what I did again if that ever happens. I am glad what I did was just for a couple of times. Because another thing I was worried about was the possibility of being driven down a deep addictive cycle of paying for sex again and again and again. Besides the destruction such a possibility would cause to my fragile psyche, just think of all the money that will be lost (it is really expensive) that I could otherwise spend on more constructive things (causes benefitting the world for instance or even self-improvement). Of course like many guys, I wish I can get into a loving relationship where then sex would be much more meaningful. However, I cannot guarantee that this will ever happen. I do not know what I am doing wrong. But, (excuse any pretentiousness the following statements may carry; it is really unintended) I think I am quite good-looking, I am sociable enough, of good manners, and have good hygiene. I feel I just have not been lucky or maybe my anxiety gets the best of me and I never work up the courage of expressing my feelings for someone I love because I never want to be creepy or make anyone feel uncomfortable. Besides, I feel that almost every girl you meet is taken. I am not the type of person who would complain about being friendzoned or whatnot. To me, it is an absurd concept. Being friends with anyone (be it guy or girl) is such a wonderful thing and not something to bewail in any way. I appreciate all the friendships I have made. But, of course, this is not say I want to be single. Humans are social animals and have needs for companionship. And, living alone can be very depressing and people get on with their lives and their families and forget all about you (not blaming them of course nut just expressing the reality of life).

In the case I am not ever able to get into a relationship, how do I prevent the temptation to see a sex worker? Or better yet, how do I even avert my sexual urges. At this point, I sometimes really wish I was asexual. Sex has been a huge distraction from so many constructive things I wanted to pursue (and unfortunately, sexual things are around us all the time; whenever I try to avert my thoughts about sex, it gets shoved into my face either online or offline, at which point my obsession about it just abruptly returns) . Before those encounters when I was a virgin who had never experienced any form of sexual or romantic contact whatsoever in his life, at least every day would involve some time where I would obsess about sex or feel so broken because I never experienced what it was like (it almost seemed like when God (if he exists at all) created the world, he decreed that I specifically never receive any form of love from a female who is not a relative). I would avert the sexual urges by focusing on other goals that make me happy and trying to improve myself in other respects (like read things and learn things and engage in hobbies etc) but they have been a short term distraction). They never work to block my urges completely. I sometimes hate God/nature for putting these urges in us. Life is starting to feel so hard. Many times, I wish I was never born.

If you have any advice on how to fight the temptation of seeing sex workers (I have nothing against sex workers, I respect them deeply and wish them the best; I love all humans and hate no-one) but I know my life would be ruined if I ever keep paying for something as addictive sex and spending so much money on it. Many people who hire escorts keep doing it for the rest of their lives. I hope I will never be one of these people for all my other goals would fly out the window and such a habit may then reinforce a self-fulfilling prophecy which would entrench in my mind the idea that I can only pay to get sex and that loving relationships do not exist at this point. If there is even something you have that could make me hate sex, I would appreciate it.

I sincerely apologize for such a long post and for writing too much. But, if you have anything that could help me in my difficult situation, I will love you forever (be deeply grateful).

Cravings and lethargy are the worst symptoms so far, but overall not too terrible. I just want to lay here and do nothing. Should I do a week of half a pill or just stay off at this point? 

Been about ~14 hours since my last dose. I quit before and the never ending depression was the worst part (see below) so if further tapering will help adjust my body then that is what I will do. 

Final question, I quit opiates once before and was very bummed out and low energy for a week after stopping. It felt like it would never end. I found an old pill in a pocket, took a half each morning before work about a week and a half after my stopping, and instantly felt better.

I just need a way to make life not come at me so fast and brutally, that‚Äôs why I cling to Xanax because it makes me black out and I don‚Äôt feel anything, someone could tell me that my dog died and I would just not even remember that I knew that and that‚Äôs what led to my spiral of addiction most recently just the need to get away from the shitty things in life. I guess I am thinking about starting to smoke weed to relieve stress and to slow life down. I‚Äôm just worried because so feel like what if I start smoking weed and it makes me want Xanax even more or makes me do some dumb shit that just doesn‚Äôt benefit me or sends me down a bad path again. I don‚Äôt want to be an addict again I ruined so much stuff for myself and my family and I‚Äôm terrified of that version of me. I didn‚Äôt care about anything, or anyone, didn‚Äôt love, didn‚Äôt hate, I just existed. A zombie, I literally existed and ate.

My question is do you guys think weed is a smart tool to use to kind of help get me out of this funk or do you think it will dumb it down and just make everything worse? Anyone speaking from experience or just general knowledge would be really appreciated!",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8175411}"

I don‚Äôt feel the marijuana is an issue in my life right now, but these damn happy pills...

I‚Äôve been on prescribed clonazepam for about 1.5 years. Started at 0.5, eventually went to 1 mg, then back down to 0.5 when I started developing tolerance. I only take them on workdays so I‚Äôve done careful math so I can take 4-5 mgs 5 days a week and none on the weekends. I‚Äôm not always anxious when I take it, I just tell myself ‚ÄúI might GET anxious later this is fine.‚Äù 

I know it‚Äôs bad. I hate how much I love klonopin. I fucking LOVE it. The first time I took it was literally the first time in my entire life I felt zero anxiety and I just ran with it. It‚Äôs not affecting my life in the sense of job or relationship loss, but I know I‚Äôm fucking over my body and brain and that I can‚Äôt keep this up without a psych catching on. I‚Äôm at the point of knowing I SHOULD start a taper but desperately DESPERATELY not wanting to. 

Anyone here in the same boat? Early stages of addiction, realizing it‚Äôs an issue and theoretically wanting to fix it, but not taking action? Where did you start? Literally no one knows about this, everyone in my life thinks I‚Äôm using as prescribed and doing well. I AM doing well but I know that won‚Äôt be forever. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for encouragement, success stories, anyone who is where I am in the recovery journey. It feels amazing to open up and tell people about this even if it‚Äôs strangers on Reddit. Thanks for having this lovely community, y‚Äôall.

new to the group and have fought addiction most of my 20's (36 now) and got clean when I was about 25 years old I was a meth user. I went to jail and that was enough for me to say its time to leave state and get clean so that's what I did. No rehab just being away from the state I live in for about 4 months was enough for me. I was the happiest I had been in years and felt great.. Fast foward 6 years or so I was still clean but had a great job and was able to afford a good amount of plastic surgery which of course with surgery comes pain pills. The first couple of surgeries I was fine and normal with them and it didnt effect me at all but by the time I was into surgery number 4 I had already started using pills on the streets (oxy) by this time i made it 11  years clean and sober didnt even drink or anything. I was so proud of myself! then BAM addiction to pills hit me and now ive of course been cut off because they only want you on those pain killers no more than 2 weeks for plastic surgery. Ive stopped pills and have moved onto Heroin non needle users BTW. I smoke it and have been doing that now for about 2 years. Im so ashamed but its true! I feel like a failure. So ive told you more than i probably really should but I feel like if anyone understands its got to be this group. So im curious as to how long you have been clean? Have you ever relapsed during that clean time? If so what kept you on track? etc Any helpful tips or encouragement would be appreciated. I hope all of what i said makes sense I kinda rambled a bit. But I really dont have many people to talk to about this. No longer have family and dont really have friends.

Honestly I feel lucky to be alive with only whiplash and a broken car as a consequence. I had just exited the freeway and was waiting to turn left. The light was red and all I could think about was the lasagna my dad and stepmom had kept hot for me. I hadn‚Äôt even planned to stop there but after my day job ended I had to go do 2 side jobs for my FIL‚Äôs business. It was a long ass day and it was going to be nice to sit down with my parents, as they‚Äôre getting older, and normally I have the kids and my wife with me so it‚Äôs always a bit chaotic. I had only called them to see how my stepmom was doing, she has had some health issues, and had mentioned I was passing through to do a job. Come by for dinner after they said and honestly it was just what I needed after a long day of grinding. So there I am sitting at the stop light I‚Äôve sat at hundreds of times before. Chatting on speaker phone with my buddy Chris and WHAM$384?:9!2:$84!:7:)!483!3$ all I see is the red light above me as my car is pushed through the intersection and onto the on ramp on the other side. Prior to the impact I heard nothing.  No screech. No horn. No nothing. I have no idea why no one was going through the intersection. Normally it‚Äôs busy and surely it would have been worse.  I drive a suburban and he was driving a brand new Cadillac. My car absorbed it like a fucking champ and saved me from serious damage. After sitting in my car for a moment to gather myself I got out and started walking towards his car. He was standing outside of it across the intersection from me. I called 911 and reported it and went to check on him. ‚ÄúAre you ok is anyone in there with you??‚Äù I say... ‚ÄúYes‚Äù he slurs. ‚ÄúWho else is in there??‚Äù  No one he slurs. I‚Äôm within 5 feet now and I smell it. I immediately turn and walk away. Dial 911 and explain that I just called in the accident and would like to report that the driver is drunk. Within moments the authorities are there. They separate us. Take my statements and by now my parents are there with me. We‚Äôre watching this absolute ass hat wobble back and forth. Trying so hard to squirm out of his misery by saying he has diabetes and was having an episode. No problem, EMTs are there to verify it. They get within smelling distance and return to their fire trucks and leave. It‚Äôs a mere formality now. We watch the field sobriety test. Fail. Then the breathalyzer. .183. This mother fucker could have killed me, or anyone else tonight, including himself. I went to get checked at the ER and i have general whiplash but other than that should be ok. I can‚Äôt stop thinking about why no one was at that intersection. It‚Äôs always busy but today it wasn‚Äôt. I hope someone reads this and decides not to drink and drive. Shit ain‚Äôt worth it man.

I'm thinking of this weekend, tomorrow, when I have to tell my girlfriend, the love of my life, that I've been using again... I don't know what she'll say or how she will take it, if she'll leave me for good this time... But if I'm going to be in recovery and leave this poison behind, I have to start with honesty.

Back in November I was sexually assaulted by a coworker. I had been sober for about a month at that point. It hit me harder thna I expected, because it wasn't just about that one incident, it became about every incident that I experienced in my youth. Foster dads, foster brothers, my own grandfather.... Every thing came back in a flash, flood gates open, I began to drown. 

I decided to stand up for myself this time. I told my best work friend, who also happens to work in HR. She drove me to the hospital, I got a rape kit done, a cop came.. I repeated my story about 5 times that day, by the end of it, I was too exhausted to feel. 

It didn't end there, the next few days after I was torn in one direction after another. The detective, the hospital, my family, my support advocates, my girlfriend. Everything was just too much. By that thursday he was arrested. I felt better, safer knowing he couldn't hurt me. So I started to try and move past it. 

Fast forward to about 4 weeks ago, I get a call from his parole officer. She tells me he's getting out of jail, and will most likely stay out until the DA presses official charges, which may take months, even years.  That was the day I lost it. I went through about 20 people trying to find a new plug. And I did!

She dropped off what I had asked for, some crystal, and even though T wasnt my DOC I knew she'd take the pain away. And for awhile it worked. I became the most productive worker, I was finally able to balance chores and meetings and appointments. And I wasn't sleeping most days, which is the reality i wanted to avoid. I am terrified of my dreams, of being unconscious like I was that night that he raped me.... 

But I digress, it took 2 weeks for that stability to fall to pieces. On the end of week 2, i lost my job. It wasnt because of the drugs, but rather because I was a single mother of a child who has autism, my boss said they needed someone there who didnt have to leave work all the time for appointments or if my son was having a bad day... I was heartbroken about losing my job. I had been there for so many years, had poured so much effort and pride and passion into it, and it was gone. 

So for a few days after that I completely broke down, I used so frequently I almost lost my mind. Nothing could console me or make things better except for that next dose.... And then I looked at myself in the mirror, and I realised what I had done, and I decided enough was enough, I was done. Broken, and done. I portioned out the remaining crystal I had left into capsels. Each day would give me a lower dose. I quit chasing the crystal with H. i threw out my pipes and needles, hell even the tin foil. And so I began the process of ending this love affair. 

I took my last dose yesterday morning, I slept the majority of the day... And today I woke up and felt everything. 

For the first time in a month I felt my guilt, my shame, my failure. I felt the loss of my job, the possible loss of my relationship, the betrayal to my family and my friends and my children. This is the hard part.. 

I stood up earlier to take a shower, my first time moving all day, my bp crashed instantly, my world went dark... And all I kept thinking was that I hope it would stay that way.

I told them that research shows kids treated for ADHD are less likely to develop substance use issues. He got pissed off and insisted I needed to dig up that research for him. He blames the drugs, blames the doctors, whatever. I ended up with some downvotes. I notice that I often get downvotes when I don't jump on the drugs are bad bandwagon. I'm wondering what other people think. There's all this evidence that addiction is caused by trauma, mental illness, and poverty whereas the majority of people who try drugs like heroin and meth do not develop an addiction.

I know this runs contrary to what we're taught in 12 step meetings. In CMA they talk about how ""crystal meth brought us to our knees, because without exception, that's what it does."" And I'm like... except for most people it doesn't tho... These drugs that ""destroyed our lives"" are just chemicals. They're just sitting in a baggy or a bottle until they're acted upon by our actions. The drugs didn't force us to use them. Other factors led to our addictions.

I have been so proud of myself this last week, tapering my doses and sticking to my schedule. I don't know why I thought this would help ease my detox, it hasn't. After my last dose yesterday morning, I slept for hours, all I dreamt of was redosing. I woke up to a phone call, to the sound of your voice, you are forever keeping me grounded. I blocked my plugs number with shaky hands and slowly drifted back off into my numb slumber. 

This morning, when I opened my eyes, I felt my body starting to react to the absence of the poison. My blood pressure crashed, my body temperature is the lowest I've ever seen it, my once beautiful face now pale with sharp cheekbones and shadowed eyes, my lips are cracked and bleeding, a sharp pain in my stomach, a darkness in my mind... How foolish I was to be hopeful that the inevitable could be avoided this time. Now I shake as my skin crawls, every vein begging for a taste of that poison, my lover, for she is my only cure.

Asleep again, plagued with memories of using. How it felt, all those months ago, to feel it for the first time... How it used to make me dance, how it made me feel like I was super woman, how I became the world's most productive worker and mother. But when I opened my eyes, moments later, I am reminded of the damage I have caused... 

I called the kids in sick from school today, claiming the family had all come down with the flu. The reality is I couldn't drive them safely, fuck I couldn't even stand. We're all in the living room, I'm letting them watch TV and tell them mommies sick so they need to be good to me today. My 9 year old feeds his little brother breakfast, and he leaves me a poptart next to my chair. These boys, I have failed them... 

I know I could have it much worse, that my life isn't as bad as many of those before me. I have been an expert at hiding, well, mostly... But, in retrospect, I could have failed more, despite feeling I've been the worst. No jail time, no institution, no social workers at my door, no suspecting teachers or coworkers or friends.... I tell myself it could be much worse, I still have something left to rebuild. None of those thoughts stop me from the guilt, none of those thoughts can ease the crushing weight of the things I've done. 

How did this begin you ask? It's been a life long affair really. I started out as a foster kid, knowing exactly how to handle that first baggie, knowing damn well what it does to people, having seen it and lived it, but I didnt care, I was so numb and dead inside, and in actuality, no one would even care. So it was then I met the love of my life, her poison washed over me, making me feel like the first time I was truely alive. She gave me confidence, she allowed me to survive, she got me through the years of abuse and unwanted touches, she kept me firm on my journey and eyes set ahead on my goals. 

Years later I was adopted by a wealthy family. They had horses, even bought one just for me. It was a dream come true, everything I had ever wanted. They loved me as if they made me, even though by that time i was already 14. I remember the first time I quit, mom thought I had the flu, she stayed home from work and took care of me. My body bounced back quickly, back to school i went.. No one ever knew back then, by that time the substance was such a constant in my life that no one had even seen me sober. Straight a student, president of my 4H club, captain of the swim team... But now they all knew something was off, i wasnt myself... I began to lose friends, i withdrew, i dropped out of the swim team, and i asked my mom if i could go to school online instead. I got sober for the first time at 16, but it didnt last long. I went right back to the only love I've ever known, and she was there to welcome me. This time was different, she didnt treat me like she did before... 

Maybe I had chaged? Maybe because I was no longer using for the sense of survival? In either case she brought hell... At 17 my parents forced me into a rehab program, their disappointment was immeasurable. They didn't understand what happened, why I did this, why I ""changed"". They could never understand that all I was trying to do was be myself! I finished highschool online, somehow still managing a 4.0. I graduated early, top 3 of my class, and with honors, that's about every thing I accomplished in rehab. Still, I was able to find my footing and decide I wanted to live without my love. 

And I did! For 12 long years, I lived my life of sobriety. I went the college. At 19 I bought a house. By 20 I met the man of my dreams. Years passed and he became abusive, we had two kids, and I left him at 24 after his abuse shifted to the boys, for I knew I was a strong woman, and I would give my children the childhood I never had. Fast forward, he dipped state,I struggled to support two kids financially but I managed. Met another man, we dated two years, split on mutual terms, he's still my friend, just texted this morning acutally. And then I met *her* and my entire world shifted. My heart stopped the moment our eyes met, and from that point forward it's like it beat only for her. And to this day, it still does. 

... Looking back I dont know how I got to where I am now. Things just slowly fell to pieces. I lost focus, I gave too much maybe, and then I gave in.

2020-02-06 18:14:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/f0126k/butterfly_effect/,BUTTERFLY EFFECT.,"Today I want to share something with everyone. If you can take the time out to read it. 
After lectures today my friends and I sat down and spoke of how we were wasting our time in University not doing anything, how we were just trudging through the days without much joy. And how we would love to live fully in the moment and have great memories. 
We decided that fun wouldn‚Äôt come to us unless we actively sought it out so we went on a long ass drive up a mountain about an hour from the city and just looked at the view with all the houses and lights looking so tiny from the distance. The three of us stood by the road and had a dance party while cars passed by looking so confused, and we laughed and laughed and laughed. We said hello to everyone who passed by and goofed around. It was a great end to our day.
Why am I sharing this? About a year and a half ago, while still in Uni I was majorly depressed. I was going through so much both in my head and in my life, I would drink or get high several times a day, almost everyday. I couldn‚Äôt handle social events unless I was stoned or at the very least tipsy. I was withdrawn from my family and my friends and was around company who encouraged me to drink and smoke because I would pretend everything was fine around them and think I was just living it up. 
I finally stopped lying to myself that alcohol and drugs were things that made me genuinely happy and sought help. It was hard and painful, it still is sometimes, whenever I get stressed or upset the feelings I used to get from these things call me. It‚Äôs hard to resist sometimes and sometimes I fail. But what I can tell you with certainty is that a year and a few later, I‚Äôm able to genuinely have good times without alcohol and drugs and that‚Äôs so crazy to me. I was so dependent that every social interaction felt empty without them. 
 This is corny as hell, but keep pushing guys, it does get better. I love you all even though I‚Äôm probably millions of miles away from you all and I‚Äôll never meet you. You will get through this, you will stumble but that‚Äôs okay, just keep moving. 
I‚Äôll leave you with a quote from Uncle Iroh in Avatar that helps me a lot, 
‚ÄúSometimes life is like this tunnel. You can‚Äôt always see the light at the end of the tunnel, but if you keep moving, you will come to a better place.‚Äù",4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.45598727}"
2020-02-06 17:26:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/f00cd3/im_sober_but_i_think_i_broke_something_that_cant/,I'm sober but I think I broke something that can't be fixed.,"I'm a 23 years old and have two and a half years off IV opiates, crack and benzos. I was a well behaved kid, athlete in high school and got scholarships to Syracuse and Quinnipiac. The problem is, I haven't related to anyone on an emotional level since I was 18, before heroin. I don't have a single peer that I really confide in. No one that I connect with. No one that can understand what I went through and worse no one that wants to. I don't blame them but it'd really  be nice to know someone who gets it.  I spend my time learning stuff on the computer, reading, staying up late, spending time with my son and taking competitive gaming way too seriously. 

I'm engaged and have a 17 month old son and live with my fiance. She's not as interested in academics as I am (I'm currently going to school for computer engineering at community college) and most of our conversation is just madatory stuff. ""Get diapers,"" ""make a bottle."" Sometimes I just want an engaging conversation but I can't get that anywhere. Not with my friends not with my fiance. However, we have built a foundation to build a marriage on through our love for our son.  Were both consistent but it's nothing exciting. That's what love is I'm pretty sure, right? That movie shit either doesn't exist or doesn't last. 

I fucking love my son. He's the best thing that's ever happened to me and I can't wait to show him the world. We go to a kids gym on Fridays and it's the highlight of my week. But I can't shake the feeling that he'll be able to tell in a few years, that dad's smile isn't genuine. That my optimism is feigned. What will I tell him when he points this out? 

I've tried NA/AAmeetings to meet new people but I'm from a rural part of CT. Groups here are shit and I can't connect with anyone. I'm great at appearances but I'm pretty sure I just hate everyone, I don't know. 

Will this be for the rest of my life? Is there anyone whos in recovery from IV heroin addiction and isn't a fucking loser? Or am I the fucking loser? I seriously can't tell.  But, I've come to terms with it, I think. I'm not meant to connect with people anymore. Granted, I'm extroverted and personable but I seriously haven't had any REAL connection since I fell in love with heroin. 

I sleep 4 hours a night so I can spend from 10-3am by myself and that's the only time I enjoy myself. I'm so alone and I'm surrounded by people that think they're so close to me and they're so glad to have me back from the pitfalls of addiction. But none of them know that when drugs took me down I never actually got up. I'm not suicidal and I'm not in danger of using. I'm just fucking broken.",72,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5346217}"

I was completely wrong, it‚Äôs done nothing but consume my life ever since and I‚Äôm just completely lost as to how this could happen so seamlessly. I‚Äôm honestly breaking down right now and don‚Äôt know how to feel better about myself. I‚Äôm about to call my doctor and admit for the third time that I can‚Äôt handle this medication despite having just convinced her I felt it would be a non issue this time around because I was doing so well. I know that only abstinence from it will help, so I just flushed the remainder of my pills too. Why can‚Äôt I handle this medication? Has anyone else had any similar experiences? I feel completely defeated and quite frankly, ashamed and embarrassed too. 

Any advice you can give would be appreciated. I was already planning on going to an AA meeting and working the 12 steps (used alcohol in the evenings more than I had liked before I had gotten on the medication - 1 week sober from alcohol currently) and have my first therapy appointment this weekend.

My one friend Tammy had two children and back in the early 2000s her 2 early teenaged children were killed by this woman who was drunk and high and somehow she got out of doing and jail time at all and just had to go to rehab and be on probation even though she 3 people (the guy driving the car that was hit was Tammy's Friend). You can imagine what that did to my poor friend Tammy.. This is why she actually got started and got hooked on opiates in the 1st place. Well this woman also goes to our clinic and everytime she see Tammy she walks past her, looks her dead in the eye and smirks. It is the most cold fucking disrespectful cunt ass shit I have ever witnessed in my whole life. And she does this Tammy all the time. We were even in group one time and she was asked by the head nurse and the counselor to not go to the Friday group because that is the only group the people who ride with state transportation (us) have to go to. Well this bitch showed up anyway and looked at Tammy and smiled while she sat down and I had to take Tammy out of the room because she was about to hit her for smiling at her like that. And if she hits her she will be banned from the clinic. And even though she was asked not to go to the group she someone talked her way into being able to stay and Tammy and I just sat in the front while Tammy was crying her eyes out to the counselor. Well today the guy driving the van and to drop is off for 20 minutes and come back.. So me and Tammy are sitting inside because it's cold out and this Bitch walks in and Tammy started getting really upset. And I guess the girl didn't notice her at first so she didn't do her smirk thing. So I ended standing up between Tammy and the door so when she came out I could block her from seeing Tammy. So she came out and went to look at Tammy and started to do her smirk but instead I looked her dead in her eyes and she put her head down and walked put real quick.. Then I followed outside not saying anything and she about ran to her car.. And her boyfriend (who is also a pos) was still inside so she sat in her car. The other 2 women we ride with were outside smoking a cigarette and I walked up to them and told them what happened and I pointed at her and the other woman pointed at her too and we all turned and smoked (them a cigarette and me a vape) and mean mugged the shit out of her.. You could tell she was scared, like she thought we were going to jump her or something.. I don't know.. The whole situation made me mad a shit and I doubt that this minor incident will stop her from being a cunt and smiling at Tammy.. but every time I see her, I don't say anything, I just give her a cold stare. And now she has to go to the clinic everyday because she pissed dirty so poor Tammy has to see her almost everyday (because Tammy is newer to the clinic). Pieces of Shit like this give addicts a worse name. Like everything wrong I did in my addiction I  am truly upset about. This bitch has no remorse. Like Tammy even asked to talk to her for closure.. and she said I don't want to talk to that bitch. (This was the day of the group incident where apparently the counselor came into the group and asked her of she would talk with her while me and Tammy where in the front and a girl in the group told us what she said). I just can't imagine, in my addiction, Killing 3 people, two of them young teenagers who just really started life and not care one bit and smile in the face of the mother who lost her babies... I don't care how cold you are.. Like who could do that? Even serial killers don't laugh in the face of the family of who they killed.

2020-02-06 04:13:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ezpt4k/its_not_my_problem/,It's not my problem.,"I can admit that I have a drug habit.  I can proclaim that I am a drug addict.  But it bugs me when people tell me I have a drug problem.  It's not a problem for me, it's a problem for them.  And when I tell them that I don't see my drug use as a problem... well, that usually doesn't go over well.  They are the ones who have a drug problem; they have a problem with people using drugs.  And now it's my problem and I need to fix it. 

I don't need these laws constantly over my head to function in a society.  I can see right through the illusion they've created to make themselves needed.  I don't need these laws to know what is right and what is wrong.  I have a simple rule I follow.  Is what I am doing harming anybody other than myself?  In my eyes there are lots of things worse than using drugs, things that are perfectly fine and dandy to do such as: lying, cheating on your significant other,  and deceptive manipulation. Hell, some of these harmful, hurtful actions seem like they are encouraged and celebrated by our society.  We're groomed to be addicts - money addicts.  Anything is ok as long as it's in pursuit of the all mighty dollar!!  Cha-fucking-ching.

What's worse, the drugs I had in my possesion, or the cops, testing me to see how well I knew my rights?  After seeing I did not know my rights, they proceeded to violate them, because they knew they could.  But I'm the bad guy? No one ever taught me my rights, imagine that!  My buddy got arrested for being homeless and incapacitated on bars.  They took the 300$ in drugs he had just purchased and 80% of the 300$ in cash he had ""for fees"". You know, the price of his luxury vacation behind bars.  He's still there.  And I suppose he's the criminal?  Yeah.... Right!  

 Does anybody really think that old white men would let the Mexican's run the show?  C'mon people... The US owns the Cartel.  They make all the money selling 'em to us, and then they make all the money arresting us and expecting us to pay $3,000 for a damn prescription pill? But I'm the bad guy... I'm the lowlife with the problem.  I don't have a problem,  I just live inside of a problem!  All the bad shit througout history is brilliantly orchestrated by the owners of this planet, corruption in pursuit of the all mighty, shitty, green paper with their faces printed on it. Distinguished by discreet reminders - reminding us that they own us, and we had better act the way they want, and think the way they want - or else pay the fuckin price.

It's easy for non-addicts - they don't wanna use drugs!  Then they expect addicts like me to suffer through the rest of my days sober.  Fuck that. I have a traumatized brain, it want's to feel satisfied as quickly as possible, and I comply.  Look, I'll admit that I could be better. I hate how selfish being an addict is, and I know it is not good for me spiritually.  The issue is that a lot of other shit isn't either.... but they pick on the addicts. Druggies are the lowest subset of people, it's encouraged to look down on druggies and treat 'em like shit.  I try to be good,  but you know they gotta be so damn expensive that life just becomes about losing everything just to get that next high... It consumes all the time I have just to get my next fix.  

It's not like I'm not functional. I can work, there's just no time. All day is a quest to get my next fix.  I smoke heroin and meth everyday for the last 3 years.  And yeah, I lost all the stupid, material shit, and all the money I had.  Y'know what though... That shit doesn't really have much of an effect on anything. It doesn't make me happy.  I used these drugs to get off of booze.  I hate fuckin booze. It should be illegal too, if everything else is!  Alcohol is the worst - and I haven't had a drink in years!

2020-02-05 17:08:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ezhgp4/hey_everyone_im_hoping_to_inspire_your_promise_to/,Hey everyone. I'm hoping to inspire your promise to stop whatever you need to stop. I have been sober for 3.5 years now from various drugs. Here's a letter I wrote to my past self.,"You recently found your phone from 2014-2015. You were just 19 then, wow you look so young. You were going through some hard shit man. I know you wanted to kill yourself every day, and I know there were good reasons. But turning to drugs was not the correct answer, and you never did feel better. In fact, you felt 10 times worse, scared and trapped like an animal. In case you forget here is a short list of the drugs you've done. Nicotine, Alcohol, Marijuana, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Synthetic spice, Acid, Lsd, Xanax, Heroin based MDMA, and Psychedelic mushrooms. Oh, I guess that's not a short list huh, you were actually a fuck up. How did that happen? And why didn't you stop?

You weren't happy with your childhood, so you became a troublemaker, and your friends were troublemakers too. So, I'm not surprised they started doing drugs and you did them as well. They say that weed isn't a gateway drug but after smoking it for a couple of years you wanted to move on and do more. Maybe that isn't the case for everyone but for you, an addictive personality, one taste and one drug isn't enough. At any point you could have stopped using drugs, but you didn't. Its not because you didn't want to, no its because you were addicted and don't let any version of us tell you different. Let me take you down memory lane to highlight your drug use.

Okay so this story Is a little funny, but it shows you how dumb weed is and no you cannot complete engineering college while smoking. You were in physics class high because it was right after lunch. Mr. Payne handed out some quizzes and it looked like algebra, but there were no numbers, just variables. Nobody seemed to understand how to complete the quiz, but you had an epiphany. All the letters suddenly made sense and the equations were so easy. The equations were solvable without numbers. You even told Andres to cheat off of your quiz because you were so confident. After turning in the quiz Mr. Payne graded them and gave them back. You made a 17% or something like that. You actually thought you were going to get a high grade, but it turned out you weren't supposed to solve anything, just rearrange the variables into formulas. And you failed the shit out of that quiz and so did Andres.

I'm going to keep the memories coming for you. You wanted to buy cocaine, but your dealer was out of town, so you asked Nic where to get some. He messaged a few people and said he found where he and you could buy. So, you and Nic got the cocaine with the last of the money in your bank account and brought it back to that shitty no furniture apartment of yours. It was very compacted and pressed together so you had to really cut it up. Eventually it was fine enough to snort. This coke stung your nostrils, and it was very strong. Stronger than any coke you'd ever done. Nic laughed and said to you that this wasn't coke, it was meth. He told you he could tell because he was a recovering meth addict. So, in that drug addict brain of yours, you decided to smoke the meth using a lighter, aluminum foil, and a dollar bill. Instead of throwing it out, YOU FUCKING SMOKED THE REST OF THE METH.

This memory is so hazy I don't even know if the details are accurate. You lived at Denny's and had a major panic attack. You had been smoking cigarettes, weed, and drinking all day. Your chest started to get super tight and you felt like you were dying. To this day I don't even remember if this really happened, but I think you called dad. You told him you thought you were having a heart attack and asked what to do. Somehow you didn't end up going to the hospital, but you really thought you were going to die. How would dad have felt if he knew you were fucked up and wasted on drugs? How would he have felt if you did die and the autopsy revealed that you OD'd on something?





Remember syphoning gas from people's cars? Wow you really did it all didn't you? You worked a full-time job in construction and somehow managed to live like a fucking homeless person. That's almost impressive how stupid it is. I'm going to tell you your story about syphoning gas because its so retarded. And don't forget you were high the entire time.

You drove your car down an alley at around 2:00am and parked it about 300 feet from where you were going to syphon. You left the door cracked and the keys loosely in the ignition so you could get out fast if you had to. So, on you go carrying your gas jug and tubing until you get to some older vehicles because you can't syphon new vehicles. You stick your tube down into the gas tank and get some suction, and it starts flowing. Get your fill and its on to the next one. You're now at like your 3rd¬†car and you hear some rocks scatter, so you take your shit and bolt down the alley. But instead of leaving, you keep syphoning just further away. Eventually you hear another sound and bolt to your car, but the fucking door got closed by the wind. Wow you locked yourself out of your car and you're carrying a gas can, tubes, and your breath smells like gas. That was a great idea leaving the keys in the car to have a head start. You hear police sirens and throw the gas can over a fence into one yard, the hosing in another, and pull up planet fitness on your phone. The police blocked the alley and came up to you asking what you were doing. You told them you were lost and trying to go to the gym. But he smelled your breath then checked your pockets. And there was more tubing in your pockets that you forgot about. You got put in the back of a cop car and two people were talking to the police outside. You couldn't help but start crying because your entire life was a fuck up so far. Over the course of what seemed like an eternity, but was probably an hour, the police officer in the front seat was asking you questions like, ""why are you doing this?"", ""Where are your parents?"" etc. He got your full sob story, which was true, but a sob story anyways. Remember those rocks you heard shuffle in the beginning? Those were two separate people who caught your ass and they called the police. But lucky for you the cop you'd been talking to talked them into letting it all slide. You somehow didn't get into any trouble. I think you used all your life's luck in this moment. One of the men agreed not to press charges if he could speak with you. He said, ""I heard some shit in my yard and saw a man messing with my car. So I got my gun and was going to shoot but then you ran down the street."" Then the cop told you a quote that I still appreciate to this day, he said, ""Son, there are two types of criminals, those in prison, and those who are not in prison yet. And you are not a very good criminal, So I suggest you drop all of this and leave it behind you."" With that he let you out of the car and helped you unlock your car door. At least you learned from this and never stole again.

Writing this is a surreal experience. I've been sober for 3.5 years and looking at those old pictures of you I don't even know you. I say good riddance. You were a belligerent, thieving, sob story telling, deceiving, irresponsible, piece of shit. You did nothing to prepare me for the future.

Went from a 4-5 x a year drinker too 5 odd times a week within a month and have been struggling doing that for almost a year. 

Went from only wanting a 4 pack to downing 2.25L of vodka and 24 beers over a 4 day bender. I was really starting to feel like my body was dying, organ cramps, massively dehydrated, liver pain constantly, coughing blood in occasion memory shot to shit, speech impediment getting worse, horribly anxious, depressed, my damn skin was even sore.

That bender started 15 days ago, 11 days ago I decided I'd had enough of feeling like I was actually dying so as a last ditch attempt I got 50x2mg alprazolam tablets and have been taking 0.5mg x4 every 4 hours daily and God damn does my body feel so much better. I'm a couple days off my longest alcohol free stint and have barely even had cravings, I'm finally free of unnecessary anxiety and my body almost feels like it belongs to the 21 year old I am again. 

Only downside, now I'm a bartard... I mean, the stuff came in a sealed bottle that I guess some dude nicked straight from a pharmacy so I know it's alprazolam, I'm taking it as the American Family of Family Physicians website dictates as a starting dose. I've worked out a safe taper, how many mgs I need to do it, how many days and a dose schedule for while I'm tapering so I feel I'm doing this is safely as possible (still illegal though) 

I dunno, was this a horrible idea? Am I stuck on alprazolam now... I just don't wanna drink anymore :( it's so awful... I'm seeing a psychiatrist for the 1st time tomorrow and will tell him about it all.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.65837646}"

He had a troubled past. Went to jail at 18, on and off drugs and other issues throughout his life but after he got out of prison in his 20s he really seems to have turned his life around for the better. He got married, had four children, had a really great job in the oil field. He seemed to be the picture of someone who turned their life around. 

Well last Wednesday I got a call from my mother that his brother found him dead from a suspected drug overdose (he had taken some Percocet the night before apparently). He had been having troubles in his marriage and was going through a really rough time and I don't know if that had to do with it, but just like that he's gone. Leaving behind a wife and kids and step kids and my devastated family. I guess things weren't going as picture perfect as many of us hoped and saw it to be.

What worries me further is his brother. His brother has been massively addicted to heroin for as long as I can remember and has even over dosed a countless number of times. When my mother called to tell me the bad news about my cousins death i thought she even misspoke. I thought she meant to tell me my other cousin was dead as, in all honesty, we all have essentially been waiting for that call for years. It feels like holding your breath. He has been so so horribly hooked on drugs that you would have never guessed it was his brother that would be the one dead. 

Well now I just feel like we're still waiting for the call about my other cousin, only now they'll both be dead and that just isn't fair. I'm not all that close to my cousin as he's more than a decade older than me, so I don't feel like there is anything I can really say to help. Besides, my mother and father have tried, my aunt and his dad have tried, everyone has tried. He'd tried to get clean many times but it never works, and he overdosed just two weeks ago only to be brought back. Am I supposed to just accept the fact that I'm most likely going to lose my other cousin any day now too? I don't think my poor aunt can handle losing another son after seeing her this last week. I don't know what to do, but I feel very helpless.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.880006}"
