Request for more questions to be answered on my Addiction-Recovery-Spirituality youtube channel set to launch on January 2020,"Thank you for the questions 3 weeks ago. I have shot and edited the videos and they will be posted on January 1st. I have banked 10 episodes to launch that day. More about the channel:

My clean date is April 12, 2010. On my channel, I answer questions in my videos about addiction recovery and spirituality. I take a broad and open-minded approach to questions on this topic. It doesn't matter where you are on the spectrum of belief and secular/atheist/agnostic inquiries are great too.

I've worked as a chaplain and addictions counselor in treatment centers. I have worked in harm reduction settings and abstinence-based treatment settings. I hold a strong belief that the recovery methodology that works for an individual is one that suits them best. My youtube channel does not favor any single form of treatment. I am an LGBTQIA+ affirming clergy person. My channel is merely a place for folks in recovery or considering entering recovery to listen to brief insights.

Any questions, if I haven't covered them, will be answered. If you ask a question now it won't be posted until mid to late January on the Youtube channel. Please provide consent to use your Reddit username in the video. If you do not use provide consent you will be referred to as an anonymous user.

Thank you.",1

I don’t know what this post is about because there are people who have it worse than me so my situation is of little importance.

I used to love helping others but I cant even help myself, my best frd is having a rough time but I'm so fucking dead inside I have nothing to give them but hopeless lies.

Or anyone in recovery, what did your loved ones do that helped you feel supported?

My boyfriend was clean for several years but 2020 hit him like it has for a lot of people and is going through another relapse, his third since the beginning of summer. The first relapse in July was bad and nearly killed him so we tried to get him into a rehab but had no success because of loopholes and lack of funds. He went back to AA and NA and was doing great, spoke with his sponsor daily and has been going to therapy but had a minor relapse about two months ago. He seemed better but spiraled again this weekend. He left this morning and haven’t heard from him since, he’s not answering my calls or texts. 

I really don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing, if I’m doing too much or not enough, how do I stop blaming myself, how do I stop feeling guilty and selfish for knowing I need to take care of my own mental health too... I love him, I care about him, he has a genuinely beautiful soul but I know I can’t fight for him to see that for himself, I can’t force him to feel worthy of a better life.

We weren’t friends, we just knew each other. Our relationship was rocky from the beginning. He had no job, addicted to drugs, drank all day, apartment was close to being unlivable. 

I finally broke up with him last night for real this time after he lied to about using and about where/who he was with. He’s also a compulsive liar. We hung out last night trying to work things out for the millionth time and when he got in his own car he texted me “I love you”. I blocked him on everything including email. I feel terrible because every time I’d break up with him he’d send me emails saying he was just going to get high and that he needed me. This time I woke up with an email saying he’s done research on the internet and believes I have borderline personality disorder, that I’m a chronic manipulator and at attention seeker. The last line is “if you think you can deal with this, please call me, if not please don’t ever speak to me again”. I am astounded. He doesn’t understand why I would break up with him for lying so much. And constantly. I would have the prove in my hand and he’d still continue the lie. I’m not sure sometimes if his qualities are purely due to the drugs or if he just doesn’t understand. He’s been using since he was 14 years old and he’s now 22. 

I want to stay broken up. I’m not going to reply like I normally would. I just don’t understand how he tries to pin this on me. We both made mistakes, sure. But I truly don’t understand. 

Just wanted to share and if anyone has any advice or words I can find solace in. 

I tried to help him numerous times. Gave him several ultimatums that I didn’t stick to. Such as “if you lie to me again I’ll leave” and this is the first time I actually stuck to it. I’m proud of myself but still can’t wrap my ahead around the email.",6

Everytime I abuse this drug I watch hours and hours of porn and I've gotten into genres so humiliating and embarrassing. I feel like my brain is fried. But man, I'm 18. I can't give up now. 

Today I'm not going to drink coffee, smoke weed, or do any of that disgusting stuff I watch porn with. It's killing my body. Probably wreaking havoc on my liver. Doing insane damage to my mind. And corroding away my mouth. But I'm confident I will find natural ways to cope WITHOUT drugs.

This sucks. I want to vent to my dad about my use. But I would feel so guilty and stupid and horrible coming to him AGAIN for like the 1,000th time now saying, ""Daaaad. I relapsed.."" 

I don't want to go through that anymore. I'm done with this now. I can't keep using any substances anymore. I'm just one of those people who are suppose to be sober and I'm absolutely 100% fine with that. I want to be sober.

Until today. I'm growing. For the first time I really believe I will recover 🙃","Like I said, I am growing.  I am still just beginning to grasp recovery. Meth took over my life for the past three years or so. It still tries to every day but I refuse to believe that it has the power to possess me anymore, I just can't give it that power in my head. Because I am stronger, all of us are. Even the people reading this high as a kite, hopeless, broken and deep in the sh**.  Just focus on being better than yesterday. What you want will come. 

I've managed to go from using dose after dose all throughout the day, (every day) to once every 10 days about now. The motivation and energy which vanishes once it's gone  is the number one toughest part of all of it for me. I thought I was farther in my recovery than I really am and this slowed down my progress I think.
Please know I'm far from perfect. I still fall into unhealthy cycles. I still fall into the abyss of impulse and temptation. BUT I'M GROWING. And with growth I have found inspiration to gracefully follow. You can even call it hope I guess.

I'm going to blog on here the next 30 Days. It will be good for me in so many aspects but it could plant a seed of hope out there, who knows. Let's keep a flow of ideas going every day for the next thirty and let's just give it all we got over now time. I will always be honest and open with you. But imagine 30 days from now, and Im holding that first sobriety token walking into the new year with that power and that GROWTH.

It was of a speedball. I'm so angry beyond belief. We thought it was heroin at first but werent sure, maybe it was tainted with fentanyl, then maybe it was a seizure (he had some problems with those before). So many different maybes. The other night somebody got drunk and spilled the beans. They saw him shoot a fucking speedball the night before he died. I've still been struggling, dreaming about him very often, wake up, he's gone, cry, repeat. But holy fuck man. A speedball, I've known lots of people who do drugs, I've done lots of drugs, but speedballs are practically myths, even people who have been junkies for years don't do that. I cant believe what a fucking idiot the person was that saw him shoot it. Still, they checked on him throughout the night and he was still breathing and warm. He got fucked up a lot of the time. He was unresponsive a lot of the time. You can't call an ambulance every night. But goddamn. Even more than that person, I blame my friend. Thats so reckless its like flipping a coin. Nothing points to suicide. Everything about his recent moods, conversations, and new huge developments in his education/career/hobbies pointed to him being over the moon and wanting to celebrate. How could he fucking do that to me and to all his loved ones? I get downward spirals and rock-bottom, I get suicide, I get fentanyl laced ODs, even just run of the mill heroin ODs. They're all unspeakably awful but. But this, what...what the fuck? I wasn't at peace with the death as it was, but time was dulling it slowly.

My boyfriend at the time wasn't much of a good influence but I wanted to do it and I did. I stopped then and continued around the age of 19. I don't find anything wrong with smoking weed, and I think that's my problem when I look for a way to stop, I could never find a reason to. But I've been realizing how it effects me. If I don't smoke, I'm gonna be a b****, if I don't smoke, I probably won't eat much, and if I don't smoke.. I'll be bored. I only used it for sleep, and now I know I can sleep without it (because of tea). 

Smoking weed took up sooo much of my time, and so much of my money. It's an expensive habit then when you can't afford it like you once did, you hit a wall, then ask yourself, ""how can I get money to continue my expensive habit that I no longer have a use for?"" I've tried taking a break before, only to find a reason not to stop by asking ""why? It isn't harming me or anybody else.."" But I know it hurts my future every day I continue. That's when I knew I needed to stop, because I have to have that self control. I have ambitions, and dreams, and weed isn't helping me get to them faster.

I come from a wealthy family, I've had every opportunity in the world. I was naturally good at most things. Got good grades, always made the sports teams. I was signed up for every activity outside of school but if I would always say I didn't want to go and my parents would jsut let me not go. Eventually kids started actually trying at things and would get better than me because I didn't try. I was always praised for being smart but never for doing hard work, I think that may have caused me to think I didn't need to try very hard, I was just good and that should be enough. I was always a follower and insecure and always compared myself to others. We had a ski cabin which my brothers took full advantage of, making lots of friends and becoming good skiers, I refused to go to lessons and ended up refusing to go up every weekend and eventually had no friends up there. I started drinking and would end up getting blackout drunk every single weekend of high school, always embarrassing myself. I ended up going to boarding school where I was getting really good grades and killing it on the rowing team. Grade 11 I get kicked out the private school, which would have lead me to getting into any university I wanted. Instead I got sent home, my battle with bulimia began, and I ended up getting terrible grades in grade 12, losing my early accepting to university that I got based on my grades form the private school. I could've made lots of connections from that school as well, but I struggled making friends the whole time, ended up with only one, a girl from Jamaica who I eventually went to visit and ended up getting wasted the whole time and haven't heard form her since. My dad ended up convincing the university to let me in anyway.

Summer after grade 12, I meet the most beautiful perfect boyfriend. I go away to university and all I care about is him. I never go to class because I always feel fat. I end up failing everything, transfer to another university. Cheat on my boyfriend all the time there, blackout drunk every weekend, make no friends, eating disorder in full force. After 3 semesters I fail out again. Boyfriend dumps me, depression hits hard.

Cocaine starts. Failed out of school, access to trust fund, living with my best friends baxk home. I end up losing all of them due to my behaviour.. Being partying non stop while they're in school. Fighting with my parents constantly, throwing up multiple times a day, drugs drugs, eventually rehab.. Twice. During this time also met another guy, he's an alcoholic, we have a 4 year extremely toxic relationship full of getting drunk and screaming. Eventually start school for a 3rd time. I have no friends anymore, just my toxic relationship. Things finally end with him, start dating my drug dealer.

Fast forward 3 years, I do so much cocaine I don't even know how I'm alive, it's free and unlimited from him. I did graduate my program but I don't know how. So many tests taken after having not slept for days. So much stress. He also has no respect for me, always lying. Need to find a job now but I cant stop this bender, it's been 2 weeks, I do drugs for 3 days straight then sleep for 2 days then repeat, how do I get out of this.

Why didn't I just try harder at everything. Why was I always so unhappy, fighting every step of the way. I have no friends from my real life, am fully immersed in this new life in a bad part of town with people who don't care about me. I can't stand my parents, but I've still never paid for a single thing in my life. I've never been taught responsibility. I feel like such a loser. Everyone I know who grew up in my life is happy and successful I don't get it.

Eating disorders, drug addiction, so much anger. Zero work ethic, zero confidence, I'm so lost. I know I'm attractive and smart and funny and have parents that love me and would do anything for me. I just can't do anything right. Why have I always disliked myself, never felt good enough, never felt good.

At the moment I’ve been up since Thursday morning, I posted the above in a venting subreddit and decided to paste it in here. My drug dealer boyfriend cheated on me, again, I’m hoping this is the end this time. Didn’t stop me from getting drugs though, just had to pay for them this time. I keep fucking doing this, cocaine for days straight, recover for a day or two repeat. I got a job a couple weeks ago but working from home makes it very easy to do drugs/drink while on the job, had to quit a few days ago as I assumed I’d be getting fired anyway. I don’t even know what the point of this post is, obviously I know what I should be doing, I just don’t do it, every time. I’m 27 and just want all of this to stop.",10

We usually forget about the pain we felt when we were at our lowest point. When we're at our lowest point, that's when we finally make a change/quit.

I got a itty bitty little hairline fracture in my heel and as of September 14th I was given medical leave from work for it to heal and I told my boss I was going to get locked in my best friends apartment so I could detox.  I did successfully come off of everything, my best friend is the best of friends and did not take me back to the city I live in no matter what I tried. That part gets pretty embarrassing though, so let's skim past it.

I guess it's because I didn't take care of my foot but after about a month locked in her apartment, I could tell something was really wrong with my foot.  It was staph, and I had MRSA in my blood(I was septic) and I guess the infection in my blood caused me to also have pneumonia pretty bad. I spent a week in the hospital , and four weeks staying with family because I had a picc line and was unable to walk due to having a relatively massive chunk of meat cut off the bottom of my right foot.

I figured it was the box that if have a hard time avoiding, but as soon as I got back to work and had money in my hand, I went and got some dope. 

For years, I was justifying my drug use as a means to avoid withdrawals, but I've never felt all that bad when I go without dope.  I could easily be mistaken and suddenly discover I'm trashed as I'm coming off of it this time, but please don't tell me about ant possible symptoms because I already know that I'll definitely feel anything I'm told to .

But from my perspective, it seems like the only thing that caused me to relapse and then continue using is because I just really enjoy the feeling. Shocker right?  News at 8, local addict enjoys drugs.  It just makes me feel pretty pathetic that I'm not able to just resist my desire because outside of my addictions I usually have pretty decent willpower.  

And so far, when I've not been high and then an opportunity to get high has presented itself, there's a period where j start scrolling through messenger trying to find someone I could tell what's going on, but for every person I have an excuse as to why not them.  I don't want this person to know because they're the type who will tell everyone, and that person would just throw it in my face if we ever had a disagreement, and not that one they have enough of their own problems.  Most of them though, I just don't want to know how weak I'm being. That I can be fully aware of the fact that I'm about to make a mistake, that I could avoid that mistake by just not making all the effort to make that mistake, but that I didn't stop.  I made the mistake. And I keep making the same mistake, I actually want to keep making that mistake even though it's ... Ya know, clearly a fucking mistake.

I finally opened up to someone about this, and they said, 'why not find someone online to talk to?"" So that's why I'm here.  I used to spend all day on Reddit, way back when violentacres was just beginning to make his first few subreddits. I can't believe someone else actually had to suggest going online, I used to exist almost exclusively online.  

I have been out of touch a few years though and it took me most of the night and this morning just to decide where to post.  I first had to just comment on a semi random thread I was reading, despite being off topic, just for the sake of saying something somewhere.",13

So this is someone I grew up with in middle school and high school and while I call him a friend, I was not in his primary friend group. After high school (and that was 35 years ago !!!!!) I don't think I talked to him once until I saw him at gathering of high school friends a couple of years ago, where we chatted briefly, then nothing until I heard of his recent situation.

I heard about his current predicament through other high school friends and I verified the facts, looked up his charges, found him in the jail computer system, checked out his bail amount. He's accused of non-violent crimes, including procession of schedule 1 substance. A college friend of his has setup a go-fund-me page to try to raise the bail money. When I first heard of the situation, I was like 'ok, let's bail him out, now!', and I even donated to the bail fund. Then I started hearing some things from the friend network about a Meth addiction that has been going on for some time and which he denies having. 

I tried chatting with his sister (who I don't know but found via facebook messenger), and she strongly advised staying away, that he has caused a lot of hurt, etc. So I guess the family help is done with. Also some of my high school friends (that were closer to him) have suggested this as well, indicating that they've tried to help him in the past but he denies his addiction problem and this is causing his current slide in society. 

He was/is a smart guy, college educated, worked in finance for a while, before ending up in a more blue collar job (not that there is anything wrong with that, but odd given his background). I have been in touch with him via the jail email/text system and we also talked on the phone for a bit. While I've touched on the addiction issue with him in my discussions, I think it is hard to address directly over monitored jail communications which can be used against him if his case goes to trial (assuming he doesn't plea-bargain). He only has a court appointed lawyer and has not been able to reach that lawyer recently ( I have also tried calling this lawyer and have not gotten a call back yet).

Despite others saying I should ""stay away"", I'm left thinking that if someone doesn't help him, he will not only spend months in jail awaiting trial, but may very well end up being convicted, and face probably more time. Is that the price he should pay for being an addict? Is it not possible to help addicts that don't admit their problem?",3

I will refer to him by his Date-Of-Birth, which is 2000-12-08. 

Normally, I’d keep ignoring Mr. 2000-12-08, but after he threw multiple small stones up at my 2nd story apartment window the other night at around 11pm, I then allowed him, along with another person who accompanied him at the time into my place, in exchange I would get my next fix of either Alcohol, or Cannabis. 

**Question: Why did I let him in?** 

**Answer: Because I was suffering extremely unpleasant psychological withdrawals.** 

**Also: If anyone offered me even just $20 worth of booze or dope, and I had nothing at all whatsoever, my eyes would light up like it’s Christmas Morning.** 

**As I am almost always, thinking of my next and strongly desired fix whenever I don’t have it, which was never an issue when I had a job, prior to the covid pandemic.** 

Then at around 4 am, my next door neighbor had tapped/banged on the wall while I was in the washroom. 

It was at this time, Mr. 2000-12-08 fled my apartment with my mobile device, which was a new Samsung Galaxy A5. 

He left with my phone, and he (or could’ve been the other person he was with) left behind a weapon in my apartment, which was a long foot long knife/blade that I wanted absolutely nothing to do with. 

I would normally call the police **from my cell phone**, but because that’s precisely the very device he stole, I **had to walk 15-20 minutes to my nearest police station** to file a report over there.

But there was very little the police could do, as he was likely already biking away over to the next town with my stolen phone. 

To which by now he has most likely already sold for more crystal meth or m-d-m-a, the main substances he uses and is addicted to. 

The only drugs I use regularly, have been the very same two substances that I have been using for the past 10 years of my life. Not 10 days, Not 10 weeks, 10, years. They are none other, than Alcohol, and Cannabis. In truth, I spend about $10 on both substances daily. So that’s about 10 to $12 everyday in booze, and about 8 to $10 for a simple gram of premium weed, adding to about $20 daily for both combined.

I used to be able to afford my habits, were cost and dependency were not issues. But due to covid, I have no job, and I am living off O-D-S-P (Disability Pay) and I get $1,200 every month, about $500 for my apartment rent, leaving me with $700 spending money to which I will run out halfway through every month, leaving me nothing at all for the later half of the month. 

Just $5 worth of weed, would make my night infinitely more enjoyable every day the closer towards the end of the month I get.

What is better, $5 worth of weed? Or 0$ worth of weed. How many times does $0.00 fit into $5.00 for my daily problem? How many times does $0.01 fit into $5.00? 500 times! 5 bucks worth of weed, whether it's a half or full gram, would make both my day and night 500 times more pleasant and 500 times less unpleasant. 

I would never have let him into my place, had I already had the desired booze and dope, required for me to get by in life, as I am a 25 to 30 year old adult man. 

There have been times in the later half of every month I considered suicide just for the simple purpose of relieving the “temporary?” yet **extremely unpleasant psychological withdrawals** that I have to deal with at the end of **every single month**. 

Everyone brushes them off because they don’t give a shit, and it’s not a big deal to them, but to me, it is **everything!**

There are millions, and millions of different people, with different problems, who covid bent over and fucked right up the ass with a big steel dildo in a figure-of-speech sense (not literally). And that is the undeniable truth. 

I am very much looking **forward,** to the next time I can get either drunk, or high. Whether it’s a day or two from now or a week or two from now. I don’t, give, a fuck. 

Because the longer I have to wait, the better the high will be. 

In all truth and honesty, Fuck Meth, Fuck M-D-M-A, Fuck Heroin, Fuck Crack, Fuck Cocaine, Fuck Crack Cocaine, And even tho I may drink Alcohol, fuck that too. 

I smoked absolutely no weed, whatsoever prior to 2011-04-29, and you would still want to punch me right in the fucking face, because I was an irritating, and annoying little shit. 

You can smoke weed and be a piece of shit. 

You can smoke no weed and still be a piece of shit. 

You can smoke no weed and not be a piece of shit. 

You can smoke weed and still not be a piece of shit. 

Bottom-Line: Whatever you smoke weed or not, doesn’t define how good of a person/individual you are.  

Right now, I don’t have my medicine (Yes Cannabis) so um, yeah. Fucking rights I’ll be unhappy/pissed-off/grumpy-as-fuck or whatever until I can finally get it again. 

I never asked to be born, I never asked to be still living at 25 to 30 years of age, but yet here I am. Fuck me right? 

I will still be pleasant and respectful to others as best as I can, but no one, shall expect my crusty quarter-century old ass to be happy about it.",0

2020-11-27 23:07:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/k2gt10/porn_and_restless_legs/,Porn and restless legs,"Hey friends. 

I've been doing this thing for the last 2 years and the time has come around again.

I've been clean off heroin for about 5 years now. And Ive also been making Porn for quite some time. Amateur porn. 

One of the things that I remember about being Dope Sick was having to deal with the restless legs. In my opinion that was probably the worst physical symptom that I had to deal with. I remember laying there one time and I had the idea to touch myself. I did, and when I orgasmed I felt relief from the restless legs for probably a minute tops. I thought I was going crazy so I looked it up. Sure enough other people have said the same thing. They get relief from orgasm.


Basically, they think that the same chemicals that are released during sex are the same chemicals that are released when you shoot up. Therefore giving you a small relief. It's true it's only a very short relief but when you are feeling the restless legs 24/7 for days straight, a couple minutes of relief can really do something for you. I remember doing it over and over and finally getting some kind of sleep when the RLS would go away for the few mins. 


Anyways on to the point. For the last couple years I've been helping people who are in active withdraw and trying to stay clean by giving away my collection of content for free. I know that it's not a very big deal it's just a really small way for me to help and keep you guys motivated. There really is no way for me to tell if you are actually withdrawing or not and I usually get a crap ton of messages so basically I just go off; 

-if you are following any type of drug sub & active in those communites and hope that you are telling the truth.

So if you are currently detoxing off opiates and trying to stay clean and if you want to take up this offer please send me a message.

I know there's going to be some mean comments because there always is, can you please try to keep them to yourself? If it's not something you're interested in then okay. If you look at my profile and im not your type, okay. No need to say it. 


I keep doing it because I've had a lot of people tell me they're extremely grateful and that it did help them pass the time and give them that small relief from the restless legs. 

Its my way of helping. 


Ill probably leave this up an hour 


Stay positive

I feel like to properly convey my experience you must understand what has fueled the opiate epidemic. I think it's part due to a certain quality in young males, something like a general lack of a desire to engage in life like is normal in society. It's thought that this is the result of technology like the internet and social media. Basically, parents allow their young children unfettered access to video games and tv. Between this and a few other unhealthy parenting habits, the child misses out on crucial interaction with peers. This results in a lack of social development which later in life will result in the feeling like they are unable to connect to anything outside themselves. If you mix this with a lack of direction or passion for anything other then video games and add in a dash of trauma you have the correct environmental activator for the addiction gene.

Now as to the way it feels, I don't speak for everyone, but this is my experience. During my childhood I saw my parents failed careers and marriage while thinking to myself, if this is the result of trying in life why does anyone try at all. This train of thought was deeply embedded into my psyche and I find myself unmotivated by anything but immediate gratification. This started out with addiction to video games/tv, this led to trying marijuana, this led to trying other things, and after graduating it led to pills, and finally heroin. Once I tried it, I fell in love, I finally understood what it felt like to be whole and completely at peace. This turned into an 8 year love affair and there is not much else to this side of things. You feel like there is only one thing in the world that matters and what you will do to obtain your drug becomes more intense everyday. During this time a lot of bad things happened jail, living on the streets, got stabbed, etc. In most cases, people can't get sober until they have experienced enough pain to fuel the change they want to accomplish. Especially during the latter half of my use, I felt trapped, scared that I would never be able to choose to quit. 

I went to rehab 8 times and detox over 20 times, each ended in a relapse. Despite wanting to stay sober, I failed time and time again and around 6 months sober I always found myself with constant anxiety which always led to relapse. At age 26 I found out I was going to be a father. I thought that having a child was exactly what I needed, I thought that this was what was going to fix me. I got out of a rehab the day my child was born. I was happier than ever seeing him be delivered, yet within 3 weeks I had relapsed. This relapse was short but what I experienced can only be compared to as the most hopeless and helpless person on the face of the planet. I thought there was nothing anyone could do to fix me, I was going to die an addict. 
This experience is what led to my current sobriety date of 10/23/2014 and I have been sober since.

Now let's get into what it feels like being in recovery. I cannot begin to portray to you the amount of change necessary for addicts to attain long-term sobriety. They say that the day the addict starts using, they stop developing. This for the most part is true. I started using marijuana regularly at 15 and that is what age I felt like in the beginning of sobriety. So I am a 15 year old newly sober heroin addict, who just became a father. I had no clue how to take care of myself physically, emotionally, spiritually...I had no work experience, skills, family hated me, little education...and I had to address legal issues, outstanding debt, terrible credit, find a place to live, find a way to feed myself, etc. Then comes trying to address our mental state. I did this with the 12 steps and a sponsor. But once I was done with them there was still a lot of change needed. The main thing was learning to be happy, which took quite a while. 

If you remember I told you about always getting to 6 months sober and developing extreme anxiety. This phenomenon is actually what makes addiction so hard to overcome. Our brains when exposed to drugs for a long period of time become hardwired in a bad way. What I mean is drugs are just a way to trick our brain into feeling happy by triggering a release of endorphins. Our central nervous system has no way to tell the difference from the endorphins released by drugs and the endorphins released from normal sources of happiness. So after we get sober your brain no longer gets those endorphins and after a few months of sobriety your brain is screaming ""where are our regular shots of endorphins!?"". The central nervous system then sends an anxiety this in the means to make the person act and a craving for whatever the person's drug of choice, in my experience these do not go away. This is why white knuckling very very rarely works.

To my knowledge, this is the only way to circumvent these urges, by learning to live fulfilled and happy. This in an effort to achieve those regular release of endorphins through actions and thoughts alone. Finding happiness and fulfillment is already hard enough on its own but if you combine this with everything else required to stay sober, you'll understand why recovery rates are so abysmal. While rare it is possible, thanks to guidance from sponsors and mental health professionals. I do have to do continual maintenance on myself though to make sure I don't slip into my old ways of life. In summation, it is one of the worst mental illnesses you can be born with. I would not wish it on my greatest enemy.",13

Yesterday was the 4th day of my streak, I am a hardcore addict, I've been an addict since my childhood days when I was in 4th grade or something, I'm 19 now. In the whole of 2020 I've never gone even 4 days without edging, I always edge at around the third or fourth day, this time however it was different. This, for the 1st fucking time I went 4 days pure into my streak. I didn't peek, I didnt edge, i didn't even watch anything bad, I really thought that ""this was it, I'm going 90 days this time""(while I've never even gone a week without fapping). And then came the 5th day, I was going as strong as I was before. But then my parents told me that they had to go somewhere and asked me if i wanted to come, I said no, cuz I had an online class that day, my sister asked twice, thrice and I declined again and again. She pleaded, cuz she didn't want to go alone, but I declined and it's not cause i wanted to fap. It's because i genuinely wanted to study. However they went and I was alone in my house, I took it playfully and thought that being alone and not fapping was a test I had to pass, I was going strong but then there were 30 mins to go for my class and I started to get bored, so i really dont know how or why but i decided to go on a chat roulette and talk to people. Everybody there was horny. I met a gay guy and since it's very difficult to find any women there(as there are none) I wrote that I'm a bi and started sexting with this guy and so he asked me to send nudes. I did. And so I started stroking. And so we got involved in a fantasy roleplay and not long after I revolted. I told him that I'm sorry i wasted his time and that I'm not gay and this didn't feel good to me and so he said that it was alright and so I was inches away from relapsing but I avoided it. I felt pretty good about not relapsing, but I was confused about whether I did relapse or not as I did search for horny stuff. But then the next day I concluded that I did relapse and so I decided to start again. But somehow I got horny real fast and as I was walking to the bathroom I was asking myself why I was doing this, but it was no use. I was in the washroom, phone in my hands and I fapped to say the least. And that was it I had officially relapsed, relapsed bad. 

To make you understand the gravity of what I did, I'll tell you that I'm a full masturbation addict. I dont stop after fappin once. I go to the washroom I masturbate once and then I dont stop stroking I search for the next video and then fap to that and I repeat this process 3 to 4 times maybe 5. Once I did this fucking 6 times. That's right I masturbated successively 6 times and I do this whole thing twice or thrice a day. I've never gone a week without masturbating in the past 2 or 3 years. I've always edged or peeked in my streak. And when I was going well finally for the first time, I was doing it, I was going strong, i was doing it right for the first time. I fucked that up. I relapsed on years of negligible improvement. I dont know man I'm mindfucked right now. 

I wish to start again but it seems so fucking meaningless. I've tried everything I can and everything I've tried, I relapsed on it. I dont know if its my age(19) or am I just an addict. I really want to get better. 


Wrote me heart out today, hope this reaches to a lot of people so that atleast one of those people's advice can work on me.

I'm going to try again from tommorow, scratch that more than half of day the is left. I'm going to start from right now. I'll not fap more today. I'm going to give it my all this time. My all. Im going to make this work. But I need to learn from those who went through what I am now. So please people if you've got something to tell.

Ive been doing coke daily, prob .5g a day, slowly all day till late. this has been an everyday habit since March, and all day sessions by taking a line or two in each session and only getting 4-5 hours sleep a night, the wrong 4-5 hours too! Prior to that I was a heavy drinker and 5x a week coke users like aforementioned.  

One part to drive my force to quit coke other than the obvious, was because of how my face looks after quitting drinking in September. The pale color of my face and the wrinkles after i got that from the drinking. is that recoverable? 

what are your suggestions on how to help pull my smooth skin back to life, maybe wipe a way a wrinkle or too. 

and the final jackpot question is how do you know if your cheeks are sinking, or if you are at risk of that happening. Like how much coke or how often for how many years falls into the risk category of something like this?  Or other issues like saddle nose and spetim holes, etc.

anything you can help with facial ideas, or tips on bueaty would be greatly appreciated.

thank you ALWAYS for the support. as said by many, and ill do it too, if it wasnt for reddit and yall in this group, i never would have accomplished what i have thus far.

(mentions suicide, self harm, drug abuse/addiction)

Bit of my background: I'm a 31 year old woman with BPD (symptoms from age 11, diagnosed at age 23) who has been through 18 months of therapy ending in 2019, I've made changes to my life and behaviour that have frankly turned me into a completely different person to who I was while I was caught up in the cycles of addiction and BPD. 3 years ago I was self harming badly, attempting suicide on almost a daily basis, severely depressed, and I am an addict (disclaimer: I always will be an addict in some way or another it's part of me and a constant struggle but manageable now) at the time I was in an abusive cycle of addiction to self harming behaviour and was addicted to abusing prescription drugs mainly tramadol (for nearly 10 years). In 2018 I took control of my life and mental health. Also I took control of my addiction issues and weaned myself off tramadol with no help from outside resources. Then eventually I was given MBT psychotherapy which was very helpful in changing for the better. And I'm ok and doing very well generally, no self harming or suicide attempts and more of a balanced mood, with no drug abuse or addiction, but every time I get a reminder or a feeling of that life before hand I feel like I'm transported back in time to being (what I feel like) is a bad selfish person who made so many horrible choices and hurt so many of my loved ones.

It's an odd thing to try to explain but here's an example; I'm currently going through a situation that is causing me to get that feeling. I am changing epilepsy medication as my current one is causing issues to my immune system, but I am dazed constantly, can't remember things, I'm clumsy and my body keeps shaking. I know these are normal side effects of the change and it's not like I'm abusing anything I'm just changing medications for the good of my body. However I keep acting and feeling like I did when I was under the spell of my more serious symptoms of addiction and BPD, I'm also being made aware of that fact by people around me which is not helping either as they remember me when I was a mess and telling me I'm acting that way again because of my side effects, so that keeps taking me back there too. I know it was hard for people around me to see me in such a state and I take full responsibility for my actions and own my faults and who they made me, but it's almost like I'm looking back at that mess of a person I was as who I am now, but still being that person before because I experienced and was in it (that may make no sense and sound a bit crazy). And then as much as I tell myself it's all ok and perfectly normal as I change meds, I have no control over this over whelming feeling sometimes of going back in time to when I hated myself and felt out of control, it even feels like it was a different person but not at the same time. 

It's hard to put into words properly, but what I'm asking really I guess is has anyone felt they've recovered from the past but when they get a reminder of who they were before a PTSD'ish (I can't think of any other way to describe it) feeling occurs? 

This all probably makes no sense, but I hope it does slightly. Thank you for reading take care ☯️",11
2020-11-26 21:34:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/k1sp58/brothers_heroin_use/,Brother's Heroin Use,"Hi all,

I'll spare you the decades of his use and what it's done and how it impacted me and my family.

My brother came over for Thanksgiving with his girlfriend and spent most of the time in the basement watching TV. Once they left the room I did a bit of snooping as a month ago he came into the house and stole a bunch of things. I found two needles, three empty baggies with residue and some weird wax paper. 

After we figured out it was him that stole he promised to get clean, went to a halfway house and all. 

I don't know what to do. I'm the only one who knows he is actively using still, fuck he is shooting up in the basement as we eat dinner right above him.

My dad has not handled it well, he blames himself for not being around enough when we were kids because he had to work to support us. As a result he buys him food, gives him money, does anything he can to support him. This has been going on for years and years.

I know I should tell them but I don't want to make everyone sad. This has happened before and I didn't say anything. I actually covered it up and threw the needles away and acted like nothing happened. 

I know I should tell, if something serious happens I will blame myself. It just makes me so depressed, I want him to be the big brother I knew growing up. I look at him and can see it and it makes me happy but then I find his needles and it kills me. 

I need to find courage and do to what I know is right but it fucking hurts so much. No one comes out of this happy in the end and it's crushing me guys.

Has anyone ever been in my shoes? What did you do?",1

I am struggling to move forward for his sake.,"My brother has put my family through hell for almost a decade now. Cocaine, pills, heroin— multiple overdoses and rehab stays (all financially taken care of by my parents). My father has started to drink after 40 years of sobriety because he overdosed a year ago and my dad had to perform cpr on him. He thought his son was a goner, as his lips were blue and he had been down for what seemed like forever. He stole family heirlooms that had been passed down to me on my 18th birthday, including the pears and diamond that should have been included in my future wedding. My parents used my college fund and all extra money for his recovery and his bills, and since they made too much for financial aid, I have $50,000 in private loans that I wasn’t prepared for. My brother is barely sober- I’m talking days here. Today I tried to be pleasant towards him, but he hogged ALL of the attention. On Monday I got the call that I got the job that I’ve been praying for. The first words out of my moms mouth were not congrats or were so proud!! Nope, they were “oh wow please keep this to yourself until after the holidays because James is fragile right now.” 

For hours today, I tried to talk to my dad and listen to “Alice’s Restaurant” together like we do every year. My brother constantly interrupted and asked my dad questions about his car and tools. My dad is equally as frustrated, but is more gracious than I am. I don’t blame him for this at all. We got to listen to our song eventually. Still, though, I am clearly holding onto a lot of anger and I am really struggling with connecting with my brother again. Hearing him talk enrages me for some reason. I feel awful because I know he is sick, but how do I move forward if he never even apologized?",3

I now owe £80 and I feel depressed and miserable. I just don't know how to stop using. In the brink of doing cocaine, I actually added all my dealers numbers back. Trying to get more. I'm just about to block and delete them again, but keep the one I owe money. I don't even have a job either. His understandable though and just let's me pay him back when I have it. But that's not the point. I feel so down right now. I know being sober is possible, I read all the stories in this sub. I'm happy for those who overcome addiction. 

I'm scared though. I don't want to rack up loads of debt like before. But my body went in autopilot, I went out searching for a source. I just can't occupy myself. I'm depressed all the time. I have no friends. All I have is a finance car which eats up all my unemployment allowance. I can never keep a job, my degraded mental health 😒 

I'm waiting for the psychiatric evaluation for Bipolar. I need the right medication to help me. I can't live like this no more. I feel trapped, like I can't control myself and be happy. I have to abuse substances to feel SOMETHING. I'm a nasty person too, I'm nice then I'm not. That's bipolar, I can't help it. I distance myself from others because I know how destructive I am. Sometimes, well most of the time I just wish I wouldn't awake from my sleep. My life isn't quiet a full on downward spiral, it's like a ping pong match being played by god and the devil.

I struggle to quit","If you look at my previous posts this month. Mixed with my ADHD medication, porn addiction is truly ruining me. Can binge for numerous hours till I end up fapping,by then I'll feel very sick,huge headaches,intense lethargy,lost a day of productivity and will likely need at least a day to recover

**Tldr:** I'm aware of how serious this addiction is , I managed to not binge watch for hours at a time which is the worst thing but after making progress, it's very easy to fall back in the porn trap. 

**I want tips to quit cold turkey**


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thankfully I have not binged since I made my previous post, I have taken days off porn and off masturbation. Sex with the gf was better


When I came back from my girl's place on Monday, at night I was feeling like fapping out of boredom/because my upcoming exams were stressing me..so I watched a tiny bit of porn to get started then finished to the thoughts of my gf. Told myself it was fine since I barely watched porn and finished to my imagination.  Then an hour later I ""checked"" if some porn subreddit had some new hot stuff, ended up doing it again

Next day I saw a drama thread on twitter about some onlyfans girl posting a vid with her ex while being with her new bf. As it caused alot of drama,I went to look at the vid, then went to look at other stuff ""just to see what's new"". Ended up watching more stuff even though I'd end up fapping to thoughts of my gf (in an attempt to not reinforce the porn habit and potentially improve sex with my gf) instead of watching 1 min like the night before,I watched  like 40 mins now.

Anyway after finishing I'd be like ""shit...okay, stop now"" but barely show any resistance if I wanted to ""check something out"" porn related, which meant I fapped a couple more times and there was more time spent on porn than thinking about my gf

Thankfully I didn't binge or waste multiple hours at a time doing it like I used to (cause since id watch porn and wouldn't fap, the dopamine rush wouldn't end and I'd have 20+ tabs of potentially good vids,each tab could lead to 5 more tabs of ""good vids"" and so on) 

as you can see, although it isn't that bad rn..... it's still quite bad , leaves me lethargic, and unproductive with headaches for the following hours

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From this I learned. Yeah, I won't even try to convince myself to just start by watching porn to get a more intense sensation when I finish to my imagination. Cause in the end,you'll watch more and more of it before you switch to your imagination (if you even switch) and it will gradually raise the frequency of how often you fap.

Quitting cold turkey is clearly the solution,especially with people like me who have issues with adhd medication and hyper-focus. I just struggle a bit with quitting cd turkey",4

First of all, thank you for reading this, secondly I would like to say that this honestly was an accident. I have a lot of psychiatric issues that require medicine. One thing that happens is due to my anxiety I can sometimes get red itchy hives/rashes all across my body. If that happens I tend to take Vistaril and call it a day (Vistaril is an antihistamine as well as an  anxiety reliever). Today I woke up panicky and itchy but I thought once I got dressed and drank some water i'd calm down. I took my anti-depressant, Sr Bupropion 150mg, and I tried to calm down. After about thirty minutes I decided to take my Vistaril but I couldn't find it anywhere so I took 1mg of my Ativan, and 50mg of Benedryl. Around the time we started to eat I realized I was stuttering on words, I was really tired, and it felt like I was floating. I layed down and slept it off.

So my boyfriend has been playing WoW for a while now, usually occasionally and I hadn't noticed anything especially weird about it until now. I'm totally fine with it, I play it too, just not that... Passionate...
Monday, the new add on shadowlands was released. He took two weeks off work for that, started playing monday night and it's like his personality just disappeared. He's so caring and nice usually, checks on me during the day over text, cares for me when I have panic attacks and stays around offering me help when I'm struggling with depression. I had a bad panic attack Monday night which he almost completely ignored, as soon as he had his headset on it was like nothings happening around him, he even laughed about jokes while I was basically next to him almost suffocating from hyperventilation, shaking and crying uncontrollably. I went to my mum's place to recover and he hasn't texted me once to ask how I've been. My depression is getting worse by the minute.
It's like he just turned into a completely different person since that add on was released, it's like he vanished from my life and I don't know what to do. I don't even think he sleeps. On Monday he was playing until 8am. I'm so worried for him and so hurt by him ignoring me. He's not even aware that this might be an addiction.

I've begun forcing myself to do things I know I used to enjoy like playing drums and video games. And I'm retraining myself to be happy again. I still crave amp when I'm unable to get going at work but it passes. No cravings for alcohol. Luckily I don't think i drank enough to really feel the withdrawal symptoms but I definitely feel better without it.",55

I don't have much time to write right now, so I won't really go into details.   
I've been sober for 15 months now, and have a 7 months old precious boy. His dad and I are fighting a lot and I think we're gonna separate sooner than later. It's been really testing my sobriety. He's been pushing me to the edge and being extremely cruel and violent in his words and how he speaks to me. Right now I want a drink and a line of coke more than anything. I cannot go down this road, not now, not now that I'm a mother. I can't risk that. It's just so fucking hard. This is the first time my sobriety has been tested like that since I've gone sober (when I found out I was pregnant). I'm so scared. How do we do this ? It's so easy staying sober when everything's fine but now I don't know how to cope with the situation without turning to my old ""friends""...",13

You are only as sick as your secrets, my friend told me once. 

If you find yourself talking down to yourself after a slip, saying hurtful ugly things, that you probably wouldn’t say to your worst enemy, don’t say them to yourself. Next time you fall,try to imagine yourself as a little child who’s in need of comfort, and say kind things to yourself.

One of the guys In treatment had relapsed a week or so ago. He ended up in a bad part of town, burning his life to the ground. 

He came and saw me today as he wanted to see a  “familiar friendly face”. We spoke for a while and he explained how he did not want to die and had to get back into treatment. We then went out and had a bite to eat, as he couldn’t look me in the eye and was very fidgety. He told me he was scared and did not know what to do as he was pretty much homeless. 

I reached out to a few people looking for a shelter and everyone was very helpful. 

We then went to the treatment Center as he wanted to obtain medication he had left behind. 

While at the centre a group of the guys came up and gave him hugs (as he is a likeable guy). And the staff offered him food, coffee and a place to warm up for a while. He was grateful. 

During this time one of the staff members went to get his medication at a nearby house and the other contacted the upper echelon of the treatment Centre. 

I watched as my desperate friend dropped his shoulders as if the world was taken off them. 

They told him he was allowed back in. 

He broke down, with relief and tears came to his face. I had them in my eyes as did the staff member who had told him. Hugs all around. 

To see the the compassion from the clients to the staff to the management in helping this man was so uplifting. With a little empathy and compassion together we can change lives. One person at a time. ❤️

—————-

This came up in my Facebook memories yesterday. My friend who was so excited and happy to be back on track to see his family and daughter ran from treatment a few days later. 

He got a little clean time before he passed away earlier this year. I’d like to think he’s watching over his daughter with no pain in his heart. Addiction may have taken the man. But I’m happy to have seen his soul. Rip 💕",14

My parents don’t really get it and when they try to help I just wiggle my way out of it. I need help but don’t know how. I have also tried ways (just me) to stop like detoxing and playing for smaller amounts each day. Nothing has worked. And the current situation of the world with COVID has made it that much tougher. I was wondering if anyone has any advice to share on how to end the control video games have on my life or how to get to a point where they are still in my life but I can control when I want to play with them and they are no longer my top priority.,1

He says he hasn't seen a counselor and probably won't for the first week. They also released him for 4 days between detox and in-patient so the detox seems to have been a waste.

I know nothing if rehab and its first time so I dont know if I should be looking for a new place or if he just needs to suck it up. He says he's scared and feels like he's in jail.

I was experiencing some really bad DT's, and i found when it was quiet with background noise (air conditioner, that weird buzzing noise from lightbulbs) i would hear very clear music in my head. It was all music i had never heard before, varying from orchestrial to hard rap. I could never make out words, but there was always a solid melody and lyrics that just sounded muffled. Some times it sounded like it was coming from down the hall, right outside my door, or even right in my ear. I wish there was a way for me to record it because, some of them were bangers.

Initially we did have a lot of phone sex and video sex..  i felt like we were making time for it and i felt good. Over the months it got little and little considering the both of us have a good libido.. i had just assumed it faded away or something and was bothered by it. But i understood he was piled up with work and has been very stressed. 

Recently i got to know he's been using porn to get his stress out. And it just all hit me that i haven't got that intimacy like before and he seems less interested in video/sexting. I do feel alone and want to help. 

I am not against porn, but it's kind of replaced a majority of our sex life and it bothers me. I hate to admit it, i do get jealous that he jerks out to other women and it's very hard for me to communicate the same to him. I kinda feel like i'm not satisfying him and somewhere i am hurt, and i don't know if that's okay to feel. I have very mixed and contradicting thoughts.

Alcohol is no more, cocaine can fuck off, mdma fuck off too, speed can fuck off, lsd can fuck off.

Any drug I've ever done has stopped me from being my full potential. I do have a mental illness. I know taking medication for bipolar isn't like full sobriety. But if they help me I'll take them.

2020-11-23 15:39:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jzpytb/ghb_detox/,GHB Detox,"I’ve been addicted to and abusing GHB for about 10 years. It was originally prescribed for clinical use under the brand name Xyrem to treat my narcolepsy but it’s gotten completely out of control, to the point where I was abusing 5-7 days per week and constantly running out of it before my next refill. It started with a little bit here and there and has spiraled out of control. Over the weekend I had a long conversation with my girlfriend and parents, and they all are strongly urging me to seek professional help and enter an inpatient detox program. 

I know conventional thinking is always seek professional help and don’t try to quit on your own, but I’ve been able to cut back lately to 2-4 days per week (thanks to Phenibut, Gabapentin, and Kratom). I know you never want to trade one addiction for another but I’m honestly at the point where I don’t care what I need to do I just want to get off this curse of a drug before I ruin my life or die. My girlfriend is extremely worried that my addiction is just going to turn into a different drug which I completely understand. But I’m so desperate I don’t care if for the rest of my life I have to use phenibut twice per week, gaba twice per week, and Kratom the remaining 3 days if it means I’m off GHB for good. 

My question is really about withdrawal. As I said I used to run out of it, and I would have to go 5+ days, maybe even a full week, without taking any. And in the past couple months I’ve had several 2-3 day stints without using despite still having some left. The primary reason the GHB got out of hand is that I was using it to self medicate for severe anxiety and depression. The good thing is that I’ve never experienced any withdrawal symptoms during periods of no use, other than increased anxiety and depression because the GHB isn’t masking it. Again, I know the safest way to detox is under supervision, but given my past experience with periods of no use, is it worth trying to detox and eliminate all use at home?

Hoping there’s someone out there with advice or professional resources to reach out to, or maybe someone can relate. It’s complicated so I’m sorry if this post is a little long but thank you in advance for taking time and helping me out. I have a best friend Laura* of almost 15 years. im 30 now, that’s half my life and I couldn’t have done and wouldn’t have wanted to do my 20s without her. Laura is genuinely a really good person; we always had each others backs, great group of friends, close with each other’s families, very cool and social and popular, if there’s something I left out I didn’t mean to because she really is that great of a person and best friend, I think the world of her. Laura went off to college, joined a sorority, we lost touch for a few years, and then picked up like nothing ever happened, but something did happen. While away, Laura saw a doctor who did not have her best interest in mind, and please let me explain bc I know it’s personal and not my place to interfere and I’m definitely not judging, but we are close enough that she has told me pretty much everything so here’s where it gets tricky. Laura put all her trust in this dr while seeing red flags the whole time. Before I really dig in, Laura is tiny, about 115 lbs and very smart. She has also over a few year span expressed her frustration with this dr specifically and the pickle she’s in. I think it started with unusually and suspiciously high doses of adderall but I’m not sure. I too love adderall, but I’ve become aware of the side effects and dangers of mixing with other medications, especially for someone with heart problems like Laura’s had since she was little. Normally I wouldnt have worried like this but Laura has expressed over and over her frustration with being prescribed BOTH 110 mg of adderall AND 90 mg of vivance every single day. This daily cocktail I soon came to find out is also a mix of other medication (large amounts of clorazopams, Xanax, lexipro, and ambien daily are other ones I came to know of for sure).  Even though her behavior and conversation was progressively getting weirder and more unpredictable, still not my place as a friend right? Your dr is supposed to be someone you trust with control over your health and well being and I am no dr. Medication is supposed to enhance your quality of life. As unhappy sometimes as Laura was with her prescriptions, more red flags were raised over time, instances such as her dr being unwilling to lower any dosage, saying that if that’s what she wanted then she’d be taken off cold turkey, which I think Laura was afraid would leave her sick at this point. She has also been subjected to trying many new medications that had just hit the market, some which made her angry or frustrated (not normal like this in her personality) which left her wondering if her dr was “getting kickbacks” for “using her as a guinea pig.” Also there were times her dad (a well known attorney) took her to appointments in which each time the dr took extra time to clean up paperwork before they were allowed in  the office (maybe not wrong, but weird.) This same dr also treated Laura’s mom, who is also a great person and like a mom to me, she used to  pick us up from parties and let me sleep over and normal fun stuff. I don’t know as much about her situation other than the medications she’s been prescribed have turned her into an ocd germophobe, years before covid. What I do know is that no one is allowed in the kitchen when she is in there , no one can touch or sit in her chair at the table, and that because of germs she won’t hug her kids anymore (Laura and her younger brother) and I know that Laura is frustrated with her mother’s side effects and ocd, especially since moving back home recently to finish college. The dr they were both seeing is gone now, their practice and office abruptly shut down with no means of being able to even contact them again, they were investigated and rumor is that they quickly left the country. Laura has now seen a few other drs and I’m hoping that one will help her and her family too. I love Laura and her family so much but I don’t know how to help or if I can. We stay in touch and always talk on the phone when one another needs a friend, but things have gotten weird lately. The conversations have gotten longer and sometimes pointless, she’s often apologizing for what she calls “tangents,” which seem to me to be adderall induced rants where I maybe get to chime in “okay” or “yea,” but more often than not the conversation just spirals one sided and though she notices and points it out first, it doesn’t really matter. The conversations usually end when Laura takes her sleeping medications and starts to slur her speech and not finish sentences. It’s painful for me, it makes me sad and I do care, and more often than not I don’t really get to talk to my friend much about anything, what’s going on with me (which has been a lot this year) and that’s okay, but I don’t often feel like she’s really there, just one example being I told her a while ago that my mom, who was like a mom to her, had recently passed, and she heard me but kept talking about college and parties, then called me back days later to apologize because it didn’t “register.” That hurt. Please note that Laura has always been there for me, I don’t feel half as concerned for our lack of communication as I do for her mental health and well being right now. Laura has always had irregular sleep patterns but now she will sometimes sleep for 24-48 hours at a time, and I don’t understand how that can be healthy. She was recently hospitalized for what she thought was a heart problem but actually turned out to be withdrawals for taking less clorazopam. She wants to get better, and has lowered some doses with the help of drs as she wanted to, and I thought things were looking up until I saw her last week. Firstly, Laura is always welcome at my house and has a key, but I wasn’t expecting her to show up at 2:30 in the morning as she did, and I haven’t seen her in a while. My boyfriend and I were startled awake (we usually sleep about 9pm-4am) and we stayed up to calm her down and talk to her while she was super upset. I’m a very firm believer that everyone should have a friend to ugly cry on their shoulder no matter what sometimes, she would do the same for me. But our state (U.S.)  right now is in the height of the pandemic, really bad. Laura and I have both been quarantining bc we both have immediate family members at severe risk, though I don’t live with mine and she does. My boyfriend still leaves home to work essentially, so him and I both have potential to be exposed often. We learned that a coworker of his had just tested positive so we had just started to quarantine and get tested with him taking time off of work when Laura came over, so knowing she couldn’t go home immediately to expose her parents was a given and she stayed for the next four days until our results came back. I was still excited to spend time with her but it wasn’t fun, I still do see parts of her personality, but not really sometimes. She slept the first 30 hours of being here, my boyfriend and I let her sleep bc we didn’t want to wake her. When she woke up she was immediately upset she forgot her medication, it was like her only focus. She’d run out of her clorazopam and was trying to reach her mom to borrow some of hers, just a very tense situation. She asked to borrow some of both my boyfriend and my medication, which we need and isn’t that much, it’s correctly prescribed, she was persistent, I drove her back home (20 min away) and back bc she didn’t want to drive on the meds she was already on. I don’t mind most of the above but now Laura says she went to the bar down the street before she came over. Several things don’t sit right with this with me. One, Laura doesn’t drink or smoke with the medication she’s on. Two, our state is really bad in the pandemic right now, I respect bars being open if you do choose to go have fun I totally get it, but it’s my personal choice to not go with my family and their at risk situation, so please don’t go to a bar and then come into my home without informing me first, sorry. Three, I’m not sure how much Laura drank but she was very upset when she arrived and she had to drive, even just a short distance to get to my house on alcohol and any medication she was on. And though there are other things that upset me with all of this, I am mostly upset bc she said she went to this bar specifically to troll an ex friend of ours who works there, though the two of us have made peace in the past. This upset me most bc friendships are supposed to be positive and a good reflection of ourselves. I wouldn’t go to bother anyone in their place of work even if I did hate them and overall I don’t hold on to negativity or past experiences like that, it’s very reckless and uncomfortable to be put in that situation for me. Laura’s always there when I need a friend, and I do the same but it’s never been quite like this before. Maybe I’m just writing for my own sanity but it’s hard. She looks and acts unhealthy and zombie like, tired and no eye contact, and the four days were supposed to be fun. I’m not the only one who’s interacted with her lately that’s concerned; friends, my boyfriend, her brother, etc. I feel like I could talk 8% of the time and twice she got mad at me for things that she said, I’m sparing the details but it was stressful. It was confusing. She’s open and honest about having abused prescriptions in the past. I’m not sure how I would feel about asking her family for help as they are already stressed and I’m not sure how they aren’t  as worried about her safety and well-being or if they don’t notice because of how this has progressed over a long period of time. I know she was dropped from another class recently. I really care and if anyone has any professional resources please help. I hope I don’t sound like a bad friend, and if anyone has any tips on how to be a better friend I’d appreciate that too. how do you address losing a friend to a problem they don’t think they have?",5

But college, as I'm learning from my first semester, is fucking brutal. So I talked to my doctor about it and was able to get prescribed adderall.

10mg, 2 pills a day. It worked wonders. I was able to actually focus on homework and time seemed to move in slow motion while taking tests. It felt good to finally be on top of my shit for once and not scrabble to get everything turned in minutes before the submission box closes.

But as final exams approach and final projects pile on top, I've started upping my dose to 3 pills a day. The first time I did it was during a particularly busy and stressful week. My brother's wedding was coming up that weekend, I had a big project to get done, a major essay over two books I hadn't read, my math and chem professors assigned more homework than usually, it felt impossible... that week I took three pills almost every day.

Tonight I was especially concerned about getting everything done. I had a final project due at midnight and like 3 other assignments. But tonight, I didn't just settle for the 3 pills. I took my 2 normally prescribed 10mg pills in the morning and afternoon, and then I took one of my roommate's 30mg pills... 50mg in one day... more than twice of what I'm prescribed. I ended up finishing everything by 10:00. Hmm, I wonder why I got done so much quicker than I anticipated? I took this 30mg pill at 5:00, it's 11:30, my heart is still beating like crazy.

I didn't think much of it until I laughingly texted my friend about how my heart was beating out of my chest from taking just one of my roommates pills. But he started showing genuine concern. He said how it was basically meth and if I don't chill out I'll grow a dependency on them. Then I started doing my own research on the dangers of too much adderall and how similar it was to meth. Apparently it's said to be more addictive than meth itself.

I don't think I'm actually addicted to it yet, but I'm sure that's what every addict says before they come to terms with the fact that they're addicted... with finals so close by I'm worried about my performance dropping if I stop taking them. I definitely will try to not go over my prescribed dosage from here on out though. But it's just concerning and I guess I just needed to let my thoughts flow a bit and type this long ass post. I'm not looking for any kind of response or advice, though it's all welcomed. I just needed to get this out there and off my chest

Edit: holy shit... I actually forgot to eat dinner... because of adderall. All I've eaten today is yogurt for breakfast and pizza rolls for lunch. No wonder I feel so weak right now. And I'm not even hungry either. This is a legitimate concern...",2

The stories moved from the cracks in the bends to the lines in their faces, and each and everyone of them can tell you what it feels like to be dead.

I recently discovered he has been an addict our entire relationship. He has also been cheating as long, approx 80 women!

He has been clean for 2 months. He has a team of doctors, counsellors assisting him. We have started counselling together. He has been more open and honest than ever. My hope is that if he stays clean, he will stay faithful. 

He has says the drugs made him cheat, I am trying to believe that. He told me pre drugs (10+yr addict) he had pre ejaculation issues, made him feel less of a man. He is taking anti depressants which coincidentally has the opposite effect, but he worries of how his libido and performance will now be without drugs. I worry too. I worry fatigue or libido could lead to a relapse, a relapse may lead to cheating. 

I would really appreciate hearing from people who can share their story of sex and ice, especially if it led to cheating and if getting clean helped. We are still investigating things like self esteem, sex addiction with his psych, but these specialists take time and this issue effects me everyday. Thanks so much for any (helpful) advice",1

I am going to make this quick. In and out. 2 minute adventure.

Two months ago, I found myself going through a 'low' in life... **To me**, having a 'low' means that I am caught up in bad habits which have been negatively affecting my present and future happiness. Two examples of this can be **nicotine** and **binge gaming**. Although I have a pretty good handle on life, these are both examples of habits that **pull me down in the long run**.

In the past, I have tried to limit them day by day and have had some success. However, after awhile, I noticed **I still fell back into the same habits**.

Fast forward two months and I have now gone **50 days without nicotine** and **no longer crave gaming**. While I still game occasionally, I find it is now accompanied by enjoyment instead of frustration.

I have accomplished this by challenging myself to **one or two goals every week**. Ex: ""No nicotine and no gaming before 5PM from Sunday to Sunday."" Furthermore, I **not only challenge myself to suppress the 'bad activities,' but I also challenge myself to do healthy activities.** Ex: 'Meditate and journal everyday until next Sunday.'

Over time, I have found I do not even crave the things I know bring me down. **Instead, I have been craving meditation and writing in my journal.** I have been thinking about posting for awhile but I wanted to be sure that this worked for me first - now that I don't even need weekly challenges to do the things I want to do, I am feeling confident it has worked for me.

My question is to anyone who knows about or has any experience with psychedelic therapy?  I read some about it.  Basically it’s where a guide or doctor/nurse gives you a heavy dose of something that makes you trip so hard that it re-wires and resets your brain essentially curing depression and addiction.

She drinks so much, like I’ve never seen someone of her size drink so much, but she also takes street-bought Xanax, which IIRC are benzodiazepines and I know it’s incredibly dangerous to mix the two. 

Last night I spent a bit of time with her, she was wasted and also out of it from the Xanax. She went to go take a bath, I tried to talk her out of taking a bath but she took one anyway. I had to keep knocking on the door to make sure she was okay. Then she stopped answering me and I managed to get the door open and found her passed out on the floor, checked for her vitals, thankfully they were fairly normal, but she was unresponsive. I was about five seconds away from calling an ambulance when she started talking. Thankfully I managed to get her upright and got her to drink about a litre of water and got her to bed in the recovery position and kept checking in on her...

But man... I’m waaaaaaay out of my depth here. I don’t know what I’m doing, I don’t have any medical knowledge, I’ve never dealt with addiction before in my life other than quitting cigarettes. I also literally don’t have enough time (or emotional strength) to have frequent repeats of last night.  I don’t want to come home and find her dead, I don’t want her to be hurting like this.

For example he got paid $1000 on Friday afternoon and now only has $300 left. 

He’s using more than he ever has in his life and told me he can’t keep living like this bc he’s so tired. He’s going to go on welfare to be able to get info some of the better rehab centres. In the meantime he asked me if he could give me his pay every Friday so that he doesn’t go spend the money on blow and I would buy what he needed for him (food) and give his rent money to his landlord for him. 

Does anyone think this is a good idea? His step Mom basically lost it on me other day and said don’t help him do anything as he needs to do it on his own. But is helping him control his money including in enabling?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am 21 years old as of november 1st 2020,  I don’t know how to start a story like this. So bare with me. As of August 27 of 2019, I am clean of meth, I can truly say that it was the lowest point in my life. But let me explain how I started. It was the middle of the summer, I was single at the time and one of my buddy’s just finished dating this one girl. Well me being me. I ended up hitting her up a couple days later. So me and her ended up hanging out.The first night we hung out she asked me if I minded if she snorted a Vicodin pill. I told her I didn’t care what she did but I was just not going to do any. She didn’t mind as far as I could tell. I didn't even see this as a red flag at the time but I should've,  I just really liked her. Eventually After about a week we started dating. 

Fast forward to a month later Our relationship started off perfect, we were a textbook “couple”. I lived with my mom still, as did she, we would go back and forth between each other's houses. Spending a couple days at each house,  One random day my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to spend the night at her brother David's house. I was very skeptical because I had heard alot about David in the past, 1st time I heard his name it was over the news. 8 people kicked the crap outta him and stole a couple ounces of weed off of him. He had needles on him and a meth pipe at the time. So right from the start i'm skeptical of him. But reluctantly I agreed to come along.

 When you walk into David's room the first thing you realize is the ungodly amount of garbage he has laying around, he was blaring music because his uncle, “ the person he lives with“ was not home. Then you realize there are literally only 2 places to sit in his room, just a shitty lawn chair or his bed, the rest is just dirty rags, bloody tissues and soda cans. But I was just chilling talking to her brother, and then I realized he was texting my girlfriend? I thought it was weird but then I started to realize my girlfriend kept leaving the room every 10 minutes or so. David was to but not at the same time, I realized they were in like a rotation. I noticed them both leaving but I shrugged it off because I trusted her. I let the hole thing go, like i said i really liked her and didn't want to sound crazy or start and argument. 

Soon after we went back to my moms house. Miranda seemed to be going crazy, she would cry and then she would go back to being normal and she would turn into the most evil, narcissistic person in the world. Calling me names, flipping out over dumb situations like a ligher i left in the car or something. I remember looking in her eyes it was just pure hate. At the time I remember taking everything so personally, I had no idea what she was on and What the effects are when you're detoxing from that shit. I really should've realized because I have many family members that struggle with addiction, and I have seen the signs.

After a few days everything seemed to be normal again we were back to our normal routine, going back and forth between each other's houses. She seemed to finally be back to her normal self, she still hasn't told me what she was doing at davids, Nor did i want to know, i was hoping it would just all work out. Well I was wrong. A Few more days passed, she wanted me to go to davids again. This really stressed me out because the last time we went there, we almost broke up. But I agreed to come along again. This time i get there and David is obviously on to something. His arms look like a pizza, he's like falling asleep talking to me, this time i quickly  realized her brother couldn’t leave the room because his uncle was home this time. In the middle of a conversation  Her brother asked me if it was ok to

  “smoke” and I was like “of course  man you do you” not really thinking  he was talking about meth. So he pulled out his pipe right in front of me and started to smoke it . I’m sitting there in shock and My girlfriend is sitting there helping him with the lighter. All the sudden I realized what was happening .. my girlfriend then took it from him and hit it right in front of me .. I was so shocked and so mad I couldn’t even talk .. I was just sitting there watching .. I  wish I left his house right then and there. 

But I didn’t.. I sat there and told her it was ok and that I was there for her. She kept openly using it for months after that. I remember truly believing I could help her, I would rather have her do it infront of me and be open about it,  rather than do it behind my back and lie to me all the time, she was just a zombie half the time, our relationship was getting terrible, we were spending like every other night at her brothers. She was always tweaking out on me about something. I remember truly hating my life at this point. 

Finally one day I was bored and depressed. It was midnight and Miranda and David were about to start one of their binges, I made the decision to ask Miranda to get me coke. I just had a thought that If she is gonna smoke meth then i kinda  wanted to relate to her and be wired to, so i decided I was gonna do coke..  I couldn’t get coke myself though because I wasn’t in the drug Scene, I had never tried coke at that time either. So we went through her cousin, we got a 40 bag of each, “so i thought” so we went to her moms that night and i snorted my first line. Little did i know she didn't get me coke, she got an 80 bag of meth and split it in half. She tricked me into thinking I was just doing coke for weeks.

I do admit that i made the decision to do meth on my own eventually, but to be fair i was already unknowingly under the influence of it when i made the decision to, she had me hooked, I was up for 3 days and I had a family function of some sort to go to and I was so damn tired I couldn’t even stand up. I asked her to get me some coke but  she knew how desperate I was and she told me she couldn’t get any coke .. but right after saying that she pulled out her meth pipe and told me “here hit this “ And that was the start of the end..

Fast forward to another month and I was extremely into it. I was spending less and less time at my house because I didn’t want my own mother to see me the way I was. I sold half of my shit and I weighed 105 pounds. “I usually weigh 125” Time seemed to fast forward.  A whole week would pass but to me it only felt like 2 days, Before I knew it I was dating her for like 9 months and we were getting our own apartment.  I dropped basically all my friends and stopped talking to my family. My apartment allowed me to hide from all my real world problems, I did nothing but stay home and use.

This is when I really got bad. I was selling and flipping bags, and was stealing from my friends, Lying to my mom and saying I needed money for a haircut when I would then take her money and go get a bag then just go buzz my hair myself. I remember sitting on the carpet for at least 8 hours looking for more meth with a pair of tweezers, scraping my pipe until it broke. I was into it so bad i remember waking up in the morning, starting to scrape my pipe, then looking up again to realize it was already night time. That's a full 12 hours.

Me and my girlfriend would argue everyday because we were both tweaking all day. It was terrible, I genuinely remember thinking that I was never gonna be able to quit, thinking that my life was over, being so depressed I would just randomly start crying if I thought about my situation. A few years before I was arrested drinking and driving and lost my car and got my license suspended. So I was always stuck at home, Miranda was crazy and bearley would let me leave her site, I couldn't smoke a cigarette on my own porch without her thinking I was doing something sketchy. 

One day me and miranda where on the verge of breaking up for some dumb reason. She threatened that if I broke up with her she would tell my mom that i was doing drugs,  This made me feel so stuck. My father has never really been around and when I think of my mother it is the purest most genuine love that anybody can have for their mother . The thought of her figuring out about me broke my heart, so I stayed with her for another couple months.Things kept getting worse and worse, her brother david moved in with us and he started causing arguments between me and miranda, he never cleaned and would just trash our house, miranda would go to work and i would be left to clean the house for 8 hours and sell bags. 

One day I finally had it, I had packed up all my shit and was on my way out the door and then Miranda got home from work. When she realized what i was doing she started going crazy, she started hiding my tools so i couldn't take my bed apart. She decided to wait for my mother to get here. She was just trying to scare me and I knew it , so I told her to go right ahead and I sat there and waited for her to come pick up me and my stuff .. my girlfriend froze when my mom got there and didn’t she say anything .  Me and my mom grabbed my stuff and that was it I finally was out of that house. I finally drug myself out of that hell I was in.

After leaving my apartment, I felt I was finally free, Miranda really dragged me down so much. She's just a genuinely sad and unhappy person, and i genuinely am a happy go lucky kinda guy, so without her my mood definitely changed, i moved back in with my mother, started eating and sleeping every night again, but sadly i still was using, every couple days i would get a bag and smoke it. In fact i think my addiction got a little worse because it wasn't always at my disposal at my moms, so when i did get it i tweaked out hard, making sure not to waste even the slightest amount, I had my 2 friends over all the time. One friend, Damion, was an addict too, he would supply me with my shit all the time. The other friend, Kaysee, never did any drugs in his life. He really helped me through this time because he was the only one of my old friends that still talked to me. Even after he figured out what I was into. They would stay over for weeks at a time, me and Damion were doing anything we could get our hands on.

This is the night everything changed for me, i had like 5 friends over, we were all drinking, me and damion where “smoking” everyone else was chilling, trying to ignore what me and damion where doing,  damion also brought me 2 tabs of acid and told me to try and sell it for him. Later that night i got this feeling in my gut, for some reason all i wanted to do was go to bed, i felt like a dick but i wanted everyone to go home, so everyone packed up and left 

the next morning i texted everyone wondering if they would wanna come back, after getting sleep i felt better, so i invite everyone over but the only person that comes is kaysee, wondering where damio  we were texting him, tryna get ahold of him, a couple hours later i was on my facebook and saw a picture of damions mugshot, saying he got arrested the night before. 

I felt so bad, because i kicked damion out he left and went to go make a deal and got caught.  God only knows what he had on him, then I remembered the 2 acid tabs he left with me, and also remembered he left his pipe packed in my house. So me being my addicted self went home and took the acid, waited for it to kick in and then smoked the rest of his pipe, Acid and meth is probably the best worst experience you can possibly have, i remember feeling like the biggest dirtbag on the face of the earth. 

It was definitely a crazy experience, i felt like i understood the fabric of why i was addicted, what i was addicted to, was hyper aware of my feelings and why i was feeling them, and exactly what they felt like, without sounding crazy that's the best way i can explain it. That's the moment I made the decision to quit, and it changed my life forever. 

Right then and there , August 27th 2019  i made the decision to quit, i turned my phone off locked it in my dresser and pulled out an old xbox 360 i had when i was a kid, downloaded skyrim and fallout 3 and just played and played for days, it was my mission to pass as much time as possible. I watched movies, played video games, slept, did whatever i could to pass time, before i knew it 1 month went buy and this was the moment i knew i could do it. I felt so inspired the first month. I still had a lot of work to do but I finally felt like it was possible. Every month that passed seemed to be a checkpoint. My mind was finally healing whatever brain cells were left and I started feeling more normal as days passed. Before i knew it 6 months went by , this is actually kinda weird but after 6 months it kinda got harder to stay sober, this was because  i was finally  getting out and seeing friends again but then they ask me “how i've been sense the last time i saw you” and then boom, i get a overwhelming feeling of guilt and anxiety, plus i knew a lot of people didn't believe me when i told them i got clean, i realized it would take longer than i thought to gain the trust of my friends again. I now realize I was probably too open with them and it really just made me look crazy, but at least I was honest. 

There were 3 different occasions where I have been offered meth since I got clean. 2 of them were my fault, the other 1 had absolutely no control over. The first 2 occasions i was hanging out with one of my friends and she was talking to this guy “zack” she wanted to go and see him but didn't want to do it alone so i agreed to come with her to help it make it feel less awkward. Well zach was an addict, “my friend had no idea”   him and his buddy aron offered me some, i respectfully turned down the offer with a level and calm head. I was really wanting to freak the fuck out. But i stayed calm and composed and just turned them down

The 3rd and final time i have been offered meth since i have gotten clean was a new girl i was talking to. Her name was daryian. She is beautiful. I have had a crush on her sense the day i met her, she is so chill and a really good person, we were hanging out smoking a blunt and she wanted to do something , so i decided i would bring her up to the “quarry” it's a party spot in my town but when your there alone at night you can see the whole city, the view is amazing and daryian said she's never been so i decided to bring her, on the way there she said she needed to stop at her friends where she was staying at the time and grab gloves and a hat and warmer clothes, i didn't think anything of it and walked with her, talking and laughing on the way, she then got to her friends house and told me to wait outside, so i'm sitting there and i couldn't help but here darian talking and then it got silent, i heard a huge sniff. Then she walked out the door. I had my doubts especially because of miranda, but i let it go and we started walking up to the quarry anyway

The quarry is a good 20 min hike, it's very steep so we took a couple breaks, just before getting to the top darian pulls out a little baggie, she then dumped the contents onto her phone , immediately knew what it was and started bugging, she then told me about her addiction and how long she's been doing it, i remember being so mad and depressed, i literally couldn't get away from th shit i remember thinking, here was this drop dead gorgeous girl, willing to be with me but yet again im forced to be in contact with my demons, she offered me some and i rejected it, we then spent the rest of the night talking about addiction and how bad it is and relating together, i took a understanding approach but let her know that i simply couldn't be around that shit. She understood and we both went home and i haven't seen her in person sense , she always wants to hangout with me but i really am skeptical 

It is now november 21 2020. I am 452 days clean and I honestly feel so good about myself, everyday is still an inspiration and I finally feel like i can communicate my thoughts clearly. My anxiety is getting better everyday, I'm building trust that I forgot was there, and am working on not being so hard on myself , trying to accept the past for what it is, the past and not letting it define my future. To this day the only person in my family that knows about any of this is my brother, i can't imagine my mother finding out, maybe one day ill tell her , but right now i need to keep it a secret",103

In January my wife of 10 years asked me for a divorce which was finalized in August. In between I lost my house, car, dogs, job, attempted suicide, and am finally ""stable"" living in my parents' basement. My ex stated that my inability to be present without drugs or alcohol, my inability to ""authentically interact with the world"", was a key contributing factor in the divorce.

I have been drinking and smoking daily since I was 14. About 5-6 years ago I reduced my drinking (not blacking out every night anymore, just on the weekends) but that only caused my smoking to increase. I smoke spliffs exclusively (with tobacco) all day, every day. It is wildly expensive. 

Every time I try to cut back on smoking my drinking increases, and vice versa. My ex is right, I struggle to be present and authentically engage with the world without substances. My only friends were drinking/smoking buddies and I have self-isolated/cut them out of my life. 

I am embarrassed to go to AA or a similar group because all I hear is the guy from Half Baked in my head saying, ""you in here for some marijuana?"" Is that silly since I just replaced alcoholism with a marijuana dependency? I was a very heavy drinker but have controlled that somewhat, it's mostly just my issue with using weed to dissociate from my reality that I struggle with. Should I get into a group? Is there a more appropriate forum for someone who never struggled with hard drugs, but definitely never learned how to be present in their daily life without using?",9

2020-11-21 11:30:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jydmak/quitting_nicotine_and_caffeine/,Quitting nicotine and caffeine,"Hi, I've struggled with caffeine and nicotine dependence for a good portion of my life (coffee since 16, started smoking at 18, 30 now). While for periods of years or months I've been able to remain free of one or the other, I periodically fall back into old habits or become overwhelmed with life and need something. 

I'm also a former substance and alcohol abuser and have been alcohol free for over a year after a 4 year period of ""continuing play with fire"" without falling back into problematic use.

I just have a sense of shame and guilt about any sort of addictive behavior even when reaching for a cup of coffee, and I've struggled on and off with vaping for a while now since I got married and had a kid.

Sometimes I feel like I don't function well without nicotine and caffeine to keep me going, but they only seem to help me for a brief period of time before I fall into a cycle of dependence and get no benefit from them whatsoever, only increased stress and anxiety from the constant rollercoaster they put my mind and body through.

I've tried almost every natural supplement or remedy you can think of, I have a tendency to compulsively self medicate and I've never shied away from trying new things.

I've been mostly cigarette free for the past 8 years, my main struggle lately has been with vaping and nicotine replacement, which I feel still negatively affect me but I find incredibly difficult to control my desire to use. 

Coffee/energy drinks/caffeine pills are also a very difficult crutch for me to avoid. Being a former substance user, while being treated for addiction in the past I used to crush up caffeine pills and take them on an empty stomach just to feel some sort of rush. I've been able to maintain a moderate regular coffee habit without doing anything like that for periods of time but I always feel very ""ate up"" the longer I go doing this. Like my body and mind are being put through the ringer by the constant caffeinated roller coaster. It's even worse when I'm doing so while also vaping or using nicotine products. 

I feel like this is my very last chance to try to find a way to stay nicotine free, and to keep my caffeine consumption to trace amounts in decaf coffee or tea, or chocolate. The problem is I fall into a state of extreme fatigue, brain fog, and anxiety with a deficit of executive functioning for a solid month or two whenever I go clean off of these two. 

This time I'm trying Creatine, based on all my obsessive anecdotal research and my own experience being on creatine years ago I feel it could help me avoid the weeks of depression I normally experience after the initial withdrawal from both of these substances, without creating a new dependency. If anyone is not familiar with creatine there is new chatter going around in some circles that it could be a very effective antidepressant and cognitive enhancer. 

Could anyone offer me some support or advice on sticking with it? I have been having trouble lately being able to push through to the 6-8 week mark which seems to be the magic number for me when I start to feel more functional again, because my day to day schedule and responsibilities feel insane with a full time job 6 days a week and managing care for my son and maintaining a household. I was just a single nobody for most of my adult life until a few years ago I'm not used to all this. Any thoughts?",2

I don't mean to hijack this sub or even if this is the right place to post this question. My brother was hospitalized about six months ago, under very mysterious circumstances. He had some issues with alcohol in the past, but swore on his childrens' lives that he wasn't drinking again. He had two very bad seizures which landed him in the hospital in a coma. After three weeks, we were finally told that he was in the beginning stages of liver failure. He refused any treatment programs, and vowed to stay sober. 

Let me pause here to explain that I am not a stranger to addiction; I have lost quite a few friends over the years to heroin, alcohol, and meth. I know that an addict cannot usually just ""stay sober"", so I had no illusions that this would be the case. However, since he refused treatment, my family and I continued to check up on him, try to help in whatever way we could emotionally, etc. Again, he was swearing that he hadn't been drinking, but we all pretty much knew the truth. 

Tonight, my mother called me to tell me that she had just gotten off the phone with my brother, who was convinced that his children were at his home. We knew this to be false, because the children were with their mother (which we verified). He raged on and on about how they were there, and when pressed to put one of them on the phone, he proceeded to act like he was calling out to one of them, saying ""you have to come talk to (my mom), or else she's going to call 911"". He kept this up for over fifteen minutes before my mother hung up and called the police. They went and did a wellness check, and said that he was still convinced the children were there, and that they had an ambulance on the way. The ambulance came and checked his blood pressure and blood sugar, and the officer was able to convince him that the children weren't there eventually. My brother called my mother and said that he recognized that he was being delusional, but he still refused to go to the hospital or seek help. 

My question is this: what can we do? We live in Kentucky, where there is a law called Casey's Law. The police officer told us that unfortunately the courts wouldn't be in session over the weekend, and that in order to seek an application of this law, he would still have to be acting erratically in this way on Monday. By then, he will have likely settled, which makes me think this law will not help. So then we would begin this cycle all over, and I'm not convinced that he will survive until there's a ""next time"" to try and have that law applied. Do we have any other options? Can anyone help me? My family and I are so exhausted and have tried everything. I literally buried a friend's ashes last month who went through liver failure, and I do not want to have to do the same with my brother. 

TLDR: My alcoholic brother is in some stage of liver failure leading to hallucinations and I need advice on how to help if he refuses treatment. 

Thank you all. I know that addiction can be an uncontrollable monster, and that no blanket answer can be given, but I am desperate.",16

I’ve noticed that I no longer want to be around people. I don’t know if this is isolation or introversion. I’m already tired as it is with full time school and work. At this point I’m think hard about things like my retirement and which university I’m going to attend. I feel like I don’t have time for anything but that. I feel like I’m leaving people out to dry. Is this abnormal??,2

So I started hanging with my buddies who party and they have a party house that is everything you want, karaoke, a casino room, a coke dealer who lived there, and girls. For about 7 weekends straight I would drink shots of vodka, chain smoke, do a few gs of cocaine, and pop trazodone to go to sleep.

It was like the sweetest nightmare with really high highs, and very very low hangover comedown days so dark that I thought of ending my life because I felt like I failed myself. Then something devastating happened, it was my birthday and I woke up to the news my good buddy Zach overdosed on heroin. I immediately started to cry and told myself I can't go on this way. Later that week I went to his funeral, and it was the saddest thing watching his parents and two kids having to say goodbye, I promised myself I wouldn't do that to my family and that I would be a recovery advocate from then on.

I got help, therapy read books, and got back into my fitness and health routine. And I also got back to my passion for music.  I am a singer/rapper similar to like Eminem or nf people say. I put my heart into my songs. I ended up making a very deep song where I came clean about everything that had been going on, and I released the music video on youtube. And it now has over 40k views with no label or help.

Then the Facebook version has 50k as well as over 800 shares and comments of people telling me they felt every word of my song and how they can relate. I have been humbled by the response.

It releases tonight on all digital music streaming services and I'm feeling a bit emotional. So I felt I would share with my fellow addicts. If you wanna listen to it google search Stylez Major -Lost in a High.

Last session I just broke down crying and told her the truth. That I had relapsed. That I was dying inside. Lying to my parents breaking their hearts. My poor mother loves me so much and sees me crying and depressed and sick all the time and doesn’t know why (I never lived with her during active addiction).

My therapist was basically like you need to go to detox and rehab but I’ll work with you to get there. I really wanted to stay home until Christmas because I was in detox last Christmas and it broke my mother’s heart.

I’m afraid my therapist will leave me before then. She’s the only one who knows my secret and I can’t do this alone. The guilt and shame alone will consume me.",11

I’m not an alcoholic, I was addicted to fentanyl but like after seeing real alcoholics at rehab i’m just like ????. No it isn’t .

My life is falling apart right before my eyes and I have to do something about it before it’s too late. Earlier this year, I had surgery and long story short I got addicted to pain medicine. I’m prescribed ambien and adderall among my other regular medications and began to abuse them along with alcohol and marijuana. If you were to see my on the streets, you’d never know. I work, raise my kids, and go to school and no one know what I struggle with and how bad it is. I’m going through a rough divorce and I recently found out one of my children was abused by a family member while she was at her visitation with my ex. I in turn started medicating more. I know this wasn’t the right response but it made sense to me at the time. I dug deep to get justice for her and get her into the counseling she needs. Her going through that triggered me and against advice of multiple people telling me to get counseling too, I self medicated. I’m not proud of my struggle and I’m even more ashamed that I hide it so well. I decided 11-18-2020 would be the last day I take hydrocodone and 11-19-2020 would be the last day I drink, take ambien or adderall, or smoke. I’m already feeling the effects of withdrawal from the hydrocodone. I’m irritated, have a headache, feel a little shaky, and just fee overall feel bad. I’m barely making it through my shift at work but I plan to go through the process to get off of everything, even if I have to suffer in silence. Deep down I wish I had someone in my life who wouldn’t judge me and someone I could talk to about what I’m struggling with. I’m so used to being strong and a loving, listening eye to everyone else and I wish I had a me in my life I could talk to. Or maybe someone who’s went through this before and can relate. I feel like I deserve the struggle I’m getting ready to endure because I was so stupid for letting this get out of hand.

Edit: update: y’all just don’t know how much all your replies and inboxes mean to me! I wish I could hug each and every one of y’all. If I don’t personally get around to reply to everyone, just know your support is appreciated and it’s helping. Today I got off work, got my kids set up for their virtual learning at my mom’s house, went home and showered, and went to sleep. Well, I slept as much as possible. I went through the sweats and chills while trying to sleep and a few muscle spasms. They’re kinda relentless. This headache won’t go away, but the diarrhea is the worst!!!! Omg! But this is all to be expected and honestly from the YouTube videos I’ve been watching I really don’t have it too bad. I’m struggling through work right now. I can’t lie I wish I had time off to devote to this process, but in the long run I know this is temporary and I will get through it all. I love you guys and thank you so being a listening ear and a support! God bless y’all!",114

-- Showed up on Saturday, bc her ex boyfriend beat her up. 
Addicts trying to get better together we were.. ""helping each other""

After her ex boyfriend shot up her apartment, 9 bullets came through the window Sunday morning, left her apartment after talking to the police, her family, decided we were leaving town together sooner than later... 
Went to a hotel, I napped, she left to go to dollar green, came back with smack and dope, and we got high.. 
Said he found out about us two weeks ago.. And she was beaten, forced to be with him since I left two weeks ago to pack up my stuff in FL and work my way back up to her getting clean.. 
Drifted off to sleep after a long three days, Woke up maybe 15 minutes later, She disappeared.. Her cat was on the table, stole $500 and headed back to her ex boyfriend. 
She's on the run from the police bc her PO issued a warrant for her.. 

Done.. Haven't been more done with it all since I've relapsed. Never want to feel this guilt, shame, and fakeness ever ever again. 

However I do have a new cat now. Her name is Fuzzy...

Live and let live! - -


Post for here -

I'm so exhausted.. After posting this earlier this morning I finally answered the counselor's phone call my work referred me to. I told my boss about the above, though not my addiction and he referred me to a counseling group in our company. 

The counselor was a nice woman, seemed to really care.. I haven't really broke down about everything this past year, but my relapsed has brought me into a world that effects me as a person way too deep.. The pain, the hurt, the lies, the monsters... I never thought I would of gone this deep into this world of this disease..

I have been admitting to the love ones that I still have these days to what's been going on with me.
However, I finally told this professional I want help.. I want to stop doing this half ass, be better to a content point and then repeat..

I haven't been this emotional for a long time. I am do tired of the faces I have to put on, the days awake, the struggle.


I was promoted last year to a dream position within my company. I have everything I have worked towards. I moved away and lost support I never replaced and now it's ruining everything I made for myself...

Im terrified after I have set up a dual diagnosis facility and admit to my Director that I'm an addict in relapsed. I will lose my job.. I'm to the point where if I do, then so be it... I believe my company is way too big to just let me go for a problem I want to fix.. I'm scared, I'm lonely, I'm disappointed... I'm on the verge of giving up again, but I really don't want to.

I'm done with feeling like this.. This hole, this emptiness, blaming myself for everything that happen years and years ago..

Not really a point here... Just need to vent.. Getting ready to take a leap of faith.",3

Most of our relationship was spent with him on opioids. I’ve never had any past with addiction myself but I learned to understand what he was going through. I love him with everything in me and I know (at least I hope) he feels the same. I watched him OD twice (both times I didn’t even know he was using.) If I had not been with him those times he wouldn’t be here. It was traumatizing for me to say the least, I still get flashbacks of picking him up when he was blue and when he started seizing out in front of me. 

Long story short, he’s been in inpatient for about 90 days now. He made the decision to go himself after his second OD. I know he’s determined to get clean forever. But I have a serious concern. I know addiction is a lifelong disease. I’m worried about him relapsing and possibly ODing and potentially not making it the third time around. I cant see a life without him in it, and maybe this sounds selfish, but I don’t know if I should spare myself the trauma of being in a relationship with him and this possibly happening, or stay with him and support him every step of the way (while taking this risk.)

It helped with my energy and focus, and made me feel on top of the world. I have multiple mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, and got into the habit of taking more than my dose (54mg) to get through work and school when I was depressed and had to energy. Over the years, I started using it more to study or get high, taking up to 4 or 5 times my prescribed dose, and popping a couple pills before going into work or taking a test. I knew I was misusing it but I was always able to take breaks from it so I thought I was okay. 
However, last weekend I was bored and very depressed so I decided to try snorting it, to see if it would minimize some of my side effects, which was a terrible idea. In the 24 hours after I tried snorting it for the first time, I ended doing it about 7 more times because it felt great, but didn’t last that long. Right now I’m in the middle of finals, and due to some personal issues I’ve been feeling like shit and really struggling to focus, which means that I’ve been snorting it at least once a day on top of taking my regular dose or two orally. I always knew I was dependent on it and I keep telling myself that I’ll be done once I finsh my finals, but I’m scared I won’t be able to stop. Due to my mental health issues I know that I’m predisposed to addiction, even though I currently only use weed and occasionally psychedelics. My ex girlfriend recently reached out to me to tell me that since me and her had broken up, she had gone from occasionally taking xans, to heroin, and now shes addicted to fentanyl and I’m terrified that I’ll spiral out of control like that if I don’t stop. I don’t know what to do because its perscribed by my doctor and I do actually need it to function well at school and work, and I can’t tell my parents or doctor without losing my perscription and getting completely fucked over. I know that its addictive, and I feel like I’m not fully addicted yet but I’m definitely on the edge. If anyone has any advice please tell me because I can’t talk to anyone in my life about this and I don’t want to spend the rest of my life abusing this drug or craving it.",2

I had constant access to it and never had to pay. I did it at least 5 times a week for almost a year (I took my first bump Thanksgiving day 2019) I’m 7 days clean and I’ve never been happier. It was so hard the first 2 days. Me emotions were going crazy, I was treating my boyfriend like shit, throwing tantrums. I promise it does get better. When I get the urge I try to cope in positive ways like working out or treating myself to doing something fun. I highly recommend the OLLY brand Goodbye Stress vitamins they’ve helped a lot with my anxiety throughout this entire process. 

I also deal with depression & borderline personality disorder. so This first few days felt like rock bottom. I would have to force myself to do things for my mental health. I pushed the fuck outta myself just to do regular shit like shower, put on decent clothes and make my bed. I got back in the gym this morning & I haven’t even had a craving today. I’m a lot happier. I have a lot more clarity. I wish I would’ve done this sooner but BETTER LATE THAN NEVER, seriously.

 I’ve been on this entire journey alone since I was a private user so I have no one to share this with but I made myself a little crumb cake to celebrate my first week sober. I can’t wait to step into this new version of myself. I don’t wanna say go back to the old me because my addiction taught me a lot & I grew so much from it.

2020-11-19 21:10:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jxghf0/coming_to_terms_with_being_an_addict/,coming to terms with being an addict,"Hey y'all,

I'll start off by mentioning that I'm 23 and have been to residential treatment twice, in addition to several IOPs and many recovery groups. Point being, there is a definite history here of things getting out of control and problems arising due to my use. I was a daily weed smoker but would overall consider my problem substance to be stimulants (ranging from ADHD meds to cocaine to, at my worst, meth).

I got out of treatment last March and quickly became restless attending AA. My cravings for weed took over strong and I started smoking pot and drinking again in early April. I was jobless due to COVID and smoked/drank pretty heavily to fill time. This went on for a while, but as time went on things started to feel normal and I started school again this Fall. By September, I wasn't drinking or smoking much at all, and I really started to question if I was really an ""addict"".

Around that same time (early September), I started thinking about cocaine again, and within a week of thinking about it picked up. I had a bulk sum of a couple grand saved up and pretty much immediately started daily use. After a month and a half, I managed to take two weeks off, but I have picked back up again with almost daily use. 

At this point I can't deny that the frequency and quantity with which I've been using makes the comedowns and days after use brutal. I tell myself each time, this will be the last time. I set it up in my head as my last hoorah and cherish that last line. Still, I find myself with another bag within a couple days. 

I hear myself making excuses: no serious consequences, I'll stop when the money runs out, I'm just ""having fun"". A big one is I don't see as much of a ""using to cope"" pattern this time around as I have in the past, which further convinces me it's just fun and games right now. Secrets out though, this shit isn't very fun any more. I see other people in passing and think to myself, ""must be nice to not be in a constant state of using and recovering from drug use."" Within minutes I shift from ""I can tackle this on my own, it's not that serious"" to ""I will probably need rehab again to quit"". I'm stuck in wanting to believe I can still drink and smoke weed recreationally. Fact of the matter is, I always find myself with cocaine. 

I've been back on cocaine for almost three months, and I am EXHAUSTED. Things have gotten ugly, but I grasp so tightly to the idea that if I just cut out cocaine I can drink and smoke with friends. I tell myself a harm reduction approach, as opposed to complete sobriety, is workable, and I just haven't tried ""that hard"" to stop. It all feels like excuses and avoiding reality. I'm facing a third trip to rehab, and I can't come to terms with the fact that I might be an addict. 

I believe my fundamental problem is I haven't accepted that I can not use substances the way others do. I am reaching out to hear from others about their experiences with accepting they can not use substances. Why do we hold on so tightly to the idea of being able to intoxicate ourselves? What is this fear of losing the use of drugs? Why have others been unsuccessful with trying to cut out some and not others? I acknowledge I have to find these answers within myself to truly find acceptance. Still, I seek to hear other's experiences with coming to terms with being addicted to substances.",6

First off, I have great news. Come my birthday (I'll be 29 years old), I'll be clean of all substances and alcohol for 3 months 💪😁

Symptoms like Euphoric recall have become way less prevalent and I'm sleeping a whole lot better again. Motivation has been good and I'm far more naturally livelier and sharper than ever before (even more than prior to and post-drug use). 

All in all, the clean life is the best life as far as I'm concerned. 

I do have 1 question though: has anybody else who has been in a similar situation to me experienced a far higher sex drive since going clean? I've been shaking hands with old rightie a little bit more than way too often but it was never usually that way. 

For reference: I've been in recovery from abusing ecstacy as well as cocaine and speed. I tripped on LSD/2CB a little more often over lockdown and smoked the occasional joint. alcohol barely featured as I pretty much traded it off for drugs. Mostly however, it was ecstacy and speed.

Make two lists go through your socials and write all the names of people you do your substances with or get them off and make another one with people you don't.

I needed them like I needed this smoke in my lungs.

I went back for more each time knowing it was slowly killing me, not caring about the damage it would leave. Scars stay, moments pass, reminders are everywhere..
The state of mind I know now is hell, because of the supposed ""good times"" I shared with hollow faces, warm bodies, plastic smiles with condescending demeanors ... the residual damage of trauma, n drug use i endure now while battling a lifelong disorder  schizo+ptsd is numbing n eye opening. 
I never acknowledged the issues. Lesson learned.
&Nothing worked(meds, docs,drugs,ETC) I am my own guinea pig when society stopped to care, help whatever, and after a decade exhausting my resources- i turned methamphetamines.

My past was full of constant fake intentions, disposable memories, deceptive stares, inescapable shame, constant regret, forgotten promises,  stale nostalgia- it all sticks. It all sucks. 

I see now i was their doormat, wipe your dirt on me..dont matter anyway I follow in suit behind to enable any situation past my control anyway
I felt their manipulations, kept going back for more.
 Time has been lost and what we have  left is a pile of ashes and I can't keep apologizing. I won't.

My past both destroyed me, and defined me in the absoulte worst ways.
I lost myself countless times between The Psychotic breaks and the bouts of addiction. Waves, cycles, people, parties, medications, doctors.. all the same.
So-
I relive it, i rewire, i rethink- repeat. Try again, try again, try a new way. Seek help, fall, break, repeat.

This tho, this was an abusive, toxic, addictive tangle of self destruction yet gave me an unsettling feeling of comfort in those moments.
A blanket of security we created among a
The broken life we made. 
Misery found their company. And company was defeated again, n left behind in the rubble alone. 
I hope misery is ok tho, still worry n always will. 

I felt i had A chance to be myself, not judged and escape the voice. Escape the paranoia. Escape the delusions, the nightmare, escape the self hate amd anxieties, in my own brain I deal with daily. 

Them, the drugs, and my impulsive behaviours kept this facade going longer than i care to admit..  False confidence gave me hope then, something i never truly had. Looking back i feel nothing but shame, pity who i was for being so fucking weak

Sad to see that the only time I felt ok with myself, was when i was high. 
Stable i thought then, insanity followed quickly.

Breathing in the mischief all around us, exhaling traumas that would stick for a lifetime to come. A circle of pain I grew to accept as my life.
I want to be normal again, i see for me-  it takes of your half life to fuck it -& up and the rest to try to fix it all before the clock runs out.
It's not fair, but i did it all to myself.knowing the consequences all along. 
I can only be mad at myself, and that's the hardest pill I ever had to swallow. Regret hurts more than the pain that created i guess. 


But i can always use a smoke to fill the void like I could use them as they drained the life from my already lifeless body, mind, fuckingHate being. 

Back to back and down to the filter, until the pack is gone..repeat.
They were my living cigarettes, i was just their ashtray. 
I felt the singe, my skin burned but it didn't hurt. I felt alive.

When it was all said n done tho we all ended up swirling around in the bottom of a hefty bag to rot with last nights forgotten leftovers.
To say were Damaged goods now would be an understatement..

They would fill me up full until i needed emptied, to repeat the torture again n again. 
Until the chaos caught up to all of us, now buried into the landfill, i hope i can grow from the trash I left behind. I hope they can too.. I can't and won't watch it anymore tho.

But till then i will Sit with it, let it sink in, muxh like the bags under my eyess
remember all those times i said or did too much?
This is it now, i deserve it.
It's all i know, like the smoke that fills the cracks in time, the spaces we try to forget and the moments past that we long for to escape are still inside. 

I ratanolize with myself daily based on the past that haunts me. An illness that embarrasses me, but a srubborn will to keep going. 
Keep trying. Keep growing, dispite the smoke I need i realized I can detach myself from them n keep rising back to myself with each puff.

Another seed, another smoke..
Tearing myself apart to grow has become all i know.",2

I've been on multiple binges but I'm not a boring asshome who only binges on coke for day and says hes a hardcore addict I binge on dxm, edibles , gin , research chemical stimulants , benzos , coke , I've eaten a gram of molly in 2 days I've done a once of shrooms in 2 days and most apparently ive binge for hours upon hours on vyvanse and adderall while gaming and than jerking off ending in psychosis but fuck me if I said I wasn't addicted to caffeine I'd be lying.

 

I never even drank this shit until the start of last year. Everyone but my little brother and nieces are slamming coffee so I said fuck it and started to. I can't even remember the effects when I first started I just know it woke me up so fast forward to right now. I feel slow and not motivated to do stuff without coffee and I noticed that when I take that first sip of coffee my body gets all warm and relaxed followed by stimulation which is pretty strong since I add a shit ton of coffee grinds in my pot its basically Espresso.

 

I've gone 2 weeks without coffee and that sucked ass I was tired all the time and grumpy but surprisingly no banging headaches like people describe about caffeine withdrawal. I've gone sober from weed for 35 days and that was so much easier. After 6 days of no weed I was just back to baseline self but caffeine was still calling my name. I havent gone one day without a strong cup of coffee in months I hate how easy it is to pick up and how hard it is to put down alright imma stop their cause I'm sounding like a raging pussy

I’ve recently been talking to someone currently going through addiction, and dealing with the effect it’s having on their life. It has made me reflect on my 6-7 years of heavy addiction. 

My addiction cost a lot. In money, hundreds of thousands. Relationships. Serious damage to my health. People’s perception of me has changed, and is probably cemented to the point where I’ll never be able to ”fix” it. I’ll have to deal with rumours and my reputation for the rest of my life. 

I can honestly say, that I’m not really bothered. I don’t know why, but I’m just not. Obviously I recognize I was incredibly stupid, and now have to pay for it, but I can shrug it off. 

The one cost of addiction, that really hits me, is time lost. For a few thousand days, there was nothing else to my life. Literally all I thought about was getting clean, or using. 

There was an approximately 5 year period, where I was using every single day. When I was using, I’d be thinking about getting clean. I spent 5 years using every day, while planning on getting clean starting tomorrow morning. 

Often Sundays were spent on a ”final” binge before getting clean on Monday. Sunday night, I would flush everything left over.  Monday, by lunchtime, I had decided to relapse, and would be trying to secure a supply at lightning speed (at any cost). A similar cycle kept repeating. Often several times a week. 

The cycle was all my life was about. My actions and thoughts revolved only around using and getting clean. I had nothing else. No feeling enjoyment, happiness, sadness, grief, achievement. Just addiction.

Its like everyone eventually stopped inviting you anywhere or talking to you. 
Its like everything was on your drug dealers time. If they said a hour. You’ll wait 5 hours or more.
It’s like being late to every single day of your life even if you started getting ready long before you were supposed to be somewhere.
Its like losing so much weight you can’t fit into any of your clothes. 
Its like losing everything you’ve ever owned in your entire life. 
Its like nobody believing a word you said, even if it was the truth. 
Its like being a prisoner inside your own head. 
Its like contemplating suicide every single day. Its like never being scared to die, because that’s what you wanted. 
Its like trying to shut your brain up for even five minutes. It was worth that little time of peace. 
Its like seeing your family beg to spend time with you only for you to leave and go get high. Because stopping wasn’t an option. 
Its like you’d do anything for more.
It’s like talking in circles for hours about absolutely nothing.
It’s like losing days,weeks,months, years off your life and not even realizing it happened.
It’s like going inside places you’d never go before you did meth.
Its like everyone hating you no matter where you went, because they knew you were a drug addict.

I’m diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder and was prescribed with clonazepam (Klonopin/rivotril) for my anxiety. For a long while I did fine without taking any so I kinda stockpiled them. But about a month ago I started needing them but the dosage didn’t work. I was supposed to take two maximum per day but I would take 4, 5. I told my psychiatrist it didn’t work so now I have lorazepam (Ativan), two per day max. And it’s really hard to not take more than two. Or to mix it with what klonopin I have left. I realized I mostly just want to feel numb because I’m starting to have psychotic symptoms again and I’m going through a rough patch in my life right now. I realize that if I do that I’ll eventually run out and be stuck in a corner where I can’t get more but need more. How do I keep myself from just taking more? Right now I’m thinking I’ll just do it this once and not do it again but I doubt it’ll just be a one time thing. I know if I do it my counsellor and psychiatrist will be extremely disappointed in me because he was reluctant to prescribe ativans and only did it because Xanax isn’t long acting enough and I didn’t want to go back on seroquel because I’m sick and tired of that drug. 

How do I keep myself from getting worse? It’s so hard and all I can think of during the day is the evening when I can take the two ativan pills. Like a reward for going through the day. Right now I just have a big urge of taking something be it klonopin or even some old seroquel because I want to feel numb. And I can’t wait for tonight when I will take my Ativan.",1

I'm worried that I might be addicted. I already know about my nicotine addiction, but now I also believe that I have, or at least developing, an addiction to alcohol.

There are four reasons for why I believe that:

1. I have never liked beer. In fact, I've hated it for my whole life. I've been sticking to red wine as that's been the only alcoholic drink I actually like, but I've found myself buying beer more and more often recently as it's easier and cheaper. I still don't really like it, so it's only for the alcohol.
2. I've always had a rule that I never drink more than once per week. I make exceptions for summer vacations or holidays, but overall I only drink on weekends, and it doesn't matter if it's only one glass or a full bottle at a party. But for the last few weeks, it's happened a few times that I've had wine or beer in the middle of the week. Never so much that I get a hangover (not yet at least) but it's still breaking the rule.
3. The primary sign of addiction, I guess (as I understand it): I've had days when I've just been craving alcohol. I'm still able to function without it and I can enjoy myself, have fun and be happy regardless but it's just the feeling of WANTING the effects of alcohol.
4. Until only a few months ago, I've never had more than a single glass of wine if I'm by myself. I never found the appeal of drinking alcoholic drinks when I could just take a cheap Coca Cola instead. Eventually, I found myself taking drinks a few times alone, but only when playing games or things like that. But now, it's happened quite a few times that I've just taken the bus into town, bought something alcoholic and just had it on my own in my dorm room.

I know that alcoholism runs in my family, even if it never actually affected me or my siblings growing up.

The reason I'm asking here is because I don't want to bring it up with friends or family if I don't know for sure. I don't want to make them worry about me for no reason. I want to know if I'm ACTUALLY developing an addiction before I do that.",1

i was abusing coke heavily by 21, doing it essentially every day, and an 8ball was usual portion to have a good time. so naturally, i’m having trouble sleeping, and staying up for days at a time. maybe sleeping 3 nights a week. 
so, next, began using xanax to sleep. started abusing them, would eat 3-5 in a night after drinking and coke use. this would cause me to sleep for like a whole 24 hours after my binge. got fired from a job. kept partying and took up heroin to put me to bed. 
no hangover next day, and quite honestly feels a lot better. nasal H for a couple months, then IV. 
then stuff gets real rough. start banging everything and trying all kinds of new shit. began shooting meth, molly, tons of coke, H obv, basically anything i could get my hands on. 

moral of he story, anyone could go the route i just explained, or they could just stay content with smoking some weed and having a couple cold ones. the choice is totally yours, just gotta think long run, and about who loves you, and who you’ll hurt if you start doing crazy shit.

I am a full functioning cocaine addict. I work a full time job remote and everything is going perfect. This was like a dream when quarantine happened, haha. I get to work from home all day now and see my family, plus none of need to leave much which means No one is really coming to see us. For the foreseeable future And past, I have been ripping lines all day, do my email and plenty of video conf calls and tons of work on the scheduling for each group...all while wired outta my mind. Then at the end of the day I can feel the crash and I’ll smoke some weed and relax a little myself, then go downstairs and cook dinner etc. 

the rest of the night is typical getting kids to sleep as quick as possible. Then maybe some work but mostly upstairs in our office with a drink and a tray with lines and camming all freakin night. For hours spending more than I should and more than one round. 

After that I’ll have an ambien in me and take a melatonin. Smoke another bowl and goto bed. I’d sleep about 5 hours a night mostly. 

No one in my life knows anything about this. They have no clue. 

I stopped drinking and it’s been going great. But I need help with the coke. 

I want to go cold turkey and I know I can but I also know it comes with side effects. 

Right now I’m doing about .5 -/+ day all day smooth, not in big chunks of it either. 

I know never to ask for medical advice here but When I stop, what are some of the effects I should expect and anything to keep an eye on. 

I’m waking up tomorrow done so wish me luck and I will post back here",1
2020-11-18 01:48:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jwb02d/should_i_give_gf_back_her_pills/,Should I give gf back her pills?,"TLDR: Should I give my gf her drugs back when she finds out I took them? Am I enabling her if I do that? What if I give her the money she spent on them? And how should I confront her?

Long story short. My girlfriend has a pill problem (xanax) she has been fighting a long time. I was addicted to heroin so I understand the struggle.

My problem is she is a conpulsive liar, especially when it comes to this. She will deny being on xanax as she is falling over from xanax.

Here is my question. She has been clean mostly for the last few months. But she picked up yesterday (I know it was yesterday because it is easy to tell her behavior). I didnt confront her because I am afraid. No matter what it will lead to her denying, massive arguement, her telling me I am shitty for not believing her, and in the end chances are she wouldnt admit it anyway and I would just end up feeling bad for starting a fight.

Today same thing. I felt so shitty driving with her today while she is clearly fucked up yet too afraid to say anything. I cant take any more fighting I am emotionally exhausted. But after she nodded out I looked in her pill holder (you would think she would find a better hiding spot by now) and found the pills. So she can not deny it at this point.

What should I do now? Last time we were in this situation I confronted her immediately after and she FLIPPED about me ""looking in her stuff"". In the end a couple days of fighting later she apologized because part of me taking her back 6 months ago was me having access to these things, though I never actually did it before.

Should I confront her again? Let her find the pills missing first to double incriminate herself?

No matter what I am 99% sure she will try to lie as much as possible and turn the whole thing on me. She has issues like that and there is nothing I can do about it. She wants me to propose to her so I am hoping she is done lying, but I doubt it.

Bigger question: She will inevitably demand her drugs back. We have been through this a couple times. I never know what to do. We are a serious couple dating 1.5 years. I understand they are not mine. But at the same time does that matter? 

Am I enabling her by giving them back? What if I just pay her the money she spent on them? One time I flushed 3 pills and she demanded I pay so I did. 

I am at a loss. I was an addict but I never acted the way she does and I dont know what my boundaries should be and where personal property becomes enabling. When a loved one took my drugs without saying anything, I just didnt say anything. I never even thought of demanding them back. And I was hooked on a drug I NEEDED to avoid withdrawal. She does not. She uses a few days a month at this point at most.

Edit: Money isnt an issue for her. Supply is. So if I dont give them back she likely will be forced to not use for the next 15-30 days.",5

I miss the old ways of coping, swallow it, self medicate, drop it and move on.
Floating in my own toxic wasteland, my mind is rotted from inside out I swear to fucking god im bending at the seams.
My brain gushes out of my eyes i see myself dead before i can crawl everyday when i open these useless eyes..picking up the pieces n shoving them back into my skull. 

Im not who I was, or who i want to be.
I feel weak.

A constant struggle to keep thoughts, keeping thoughts, thoughts that keep me awake.

Try to talk slower, turn off my mind. Can't stop the voice. Can't stop that fucking voice. 

Creeps up, into a scream. Digging itself out from the garbage, from inside of my head to the top and into my ear. 

Makes me miss those mind erasing pills, miss not caring or being so focused on what is or is not real. Silencing her, silencing the stress, life, putting a pause on thoughts was a nice feature i quickly abused.

I turned 16 a month ago, and for the last past 6 years of my life I've been struggling with weed. After I hit that blunt in the summer of 5th grade my life completely shifted. What started with just something fun to do turned into something I felt necessary to do in order to have a good day.

I come from poverty, zone 6 Atlanta. I grew up without my dad, he left us when I was born, and my mom worked for most of my childhood and to this day. Because of that I always felt something was missing, Couldn't really pin point it though. My first addiction came from getting in trouble at school in 3-5th grade, I just loved the feeling of getting called out and kicked out of class. Since I was the trouble maker, I surrounded myself with other kids just like me, talking back to the teacher, getting kicked out, talking a lot in class. These kids had older brothers that smoked weed, I was hanging out with one of them in the summer of 5th grade and they let me take a few hit of the blunt. Wow, an experience that is unforgettable. It was like all my problems were gone and all I could think about is how I feel extremely funny. Days and weeks past by and I found myself wanting to be with that kid and his older brother more, and hitting the blunt sometimes. 

Then comes 6th grade, kids were starting to get more exposed to weed and some were starting to use it as well. The thing you guys are probably wondering is what's wrong with a stoner? This wasn't the case for us, the area where we are from comes big into play with how we act, just a bunch of lost kids, deprived of love and attention. Instead of being stoners, we would smoke everyday but also, skip school, do graffiti and run around in stores stealing shit. my tolerance went up in the process, making me need more and more of the drug to feel the same, and grades? what grades? oh those, math in 23% and 24 absences in a row. My mom would come home from a long day of work and start beating me when she would find out I was smoking and skipping. Everything that would happen at home I would take out on myself. This continued until the end of 7th grade, where it escalated. I started hanging with gang members, sagging my pants, cursing at the teachers, starting fights at school, I remember perfectly the power i felt when i held a glock 42 and shot it for the first time.

After all the fights and arguments i got expelled. I stopped coming home, would sneak out, Couldn't catch me one second without being high, I always had something to get high with, percs, xans, molly, weed. Never got addicted to those though, weed was my number one. I became into a horrible person in 8th grade, basically stopped going to school, I robbed a lot of plugs for their drugs and money, I cursed at my mom a lot and left home for days, I was selling drugs and selling them to people who never smoked before with the intention they will get hooked. I got arrested for the first time in july 2nd 2018. I went into juvenile for 7 months for being caught with 43 G's of weed and a gun. When I was in jail i mainly stayed with the Latin Kings because i am hispanic. Got close with a lot of them and once i got out i got myself affiliated with the gang, completely fell in love with it. It was like the love i never got from anyone all in one. But school was the last thing to pass by my head. 

Once i got into high school i stopped going to school all together, turned into a complete thug, got tattoos, started walking with bandanas on sagging my pants, always high out my mind. My mom came home one day and sat me down and instead of hitting me, she just broke down and cried, she started saying she doesn't want me dead and that she's sorry for how its been these last years, she would do anything to change the things she's done. Instead of me opening my eyes, I laughed at her and told her to shut the fuck up and went back outside. The drugs were starting to close my mind and make me not feel anything but a haze in my head.

In the summer of 9th grade my cousin from the brookyln ghettos came for a visit. He had many serious conversations with me. Many things i already knew but just opened my mind a little bit more. Do i really want to be this for the rest of my life? Do i really want to die known as nothing? Just another latino from the ghetto that didn't make it? I'm in 10th grade now im 16, trying to get a grasp of my life a little. I still smoke everyday and i'm going to school atleast. I am an addict but the weed is not the problem, I am the problem, I am the one who made all those choices. I have hope that I will get out of this one day, I left out so many details, but it is just too much to write. Does anyone else have any similar experiences? feel free to write them. Or just anything else you want to say i am open to read. Thank you and stay safe, have a good night.",8

idk, i understand grades don’t define my worth, and a well written personal statement could make up for some things when i (hopefully) apply to grad school, but i feel like shit about myself. i hate that i let myself get to this place again, and i hate even more that i can’t find any ability to care about the situation. obviously i care enough to beat myself up for it but...you know what i mean. 

hoping to connect with others who have struggled in college due to addiction. i’m willing to take the L on this one, but some camaraderie here might help me not feel like such a damn failure.",12

I attended my first AA meeting yesterday, and this morning, my second. It felt really empowering. At the same time, I was overcome (not because of the meeting, just a random thought) with a thought. ""Your addictions aren't as valid and aren't as serious."" I would never think that way about someone else, so why would I not afford myself the same sense of kindness? Is pornography and spending addiction not seen as serious, or is it just my thoughts that are invalid and that my addictions **are** indeed valid?

People say that everyone just grows out of their addiction. Is this true? IMO, it only gets worse unless you do the work daily. But then that's not ""growing out of it"", that's recovery and growth. Growing out of it implies it wasn't addiction in the first place, no? You do the work and that's what counts, but I don't see that as ""growing out of it."" Am I misunderstanding the theory?",2

I really don’t want to burden y’all with my life story, it’s okay if you don’t read all this, but I need to pen this down. I don’t know what my life has come to. I topped my high school six months ago and even got a grade that less than one per cent of the people get in my curriculum. I’ve been painted as a world topper and a golden girl throughout my life. My parents have always been proud of me. But I think that’s breaking apart. I feel like I’m leading a double life. I really don’t know what to do. I’m really scared of my past self. She could achieve everything and anything, but now, I think I’ve set myself up for failure. I really think I’m pretending to be someone I’m not. It’s like I’m a different person? And that scares me so fucking much.

So, the backstory: The first life I’m leading is of an insanely talented girl who can do pretty much everything. Academics, music, dance, everything. She is pretty much perfect on paper. But, my second identity is beyond disgusting. I have been suffering from internet addiction for 6 years. It all started with porn. I started consuming porn, masturbating and even seeing sexual violence since I was barely 10 and whenever I think of it, I feel so ashamed of that. As a child, I didn’t even know what porn was, so I feel like I’ve irreparably damaged a part of myself by watching porn too early.

I desperately wanted out. I tried everything: talking more, exercising, diet, everything. But nothing was working out. I then got to know that porn encourages sexual trafficking and whatnot, so I knew I had to stop this, for its victims, if not for myself. That’s why I decided to replace my addiction. I knew I couldn’t get off the internet. So, I started consuming Japanese anime, YouTube, dramas, online TV shows, online pirated movies, K-Pop/Dramas, and everything online. This replacement of addiction was and still is very unhealthy. My exercise, diet, sleep schedule, work, study, family life, relationships, everything is ruined.

I have started university now. And my professors and dean think I’m still that perfect girl. But I swear to God, there isn’t one single day that’s gone by without me sobbing about my problems. Every night, I cry myself to sleep. My semester exams are in a few days. I’m trying to study, but it’s impossible to know when I’ll slip. My mum knows about my internet addiction phases, I confessed to her during my 18th birthday, though, I lied and said, I’ve gotten over it. But apart from that, no one else has a clue. I hide myself very well. But it hurts so much. I really want to stop. There are times, when I get my life back together, start studying, exercising, sleeping well, but this only lasts for a few days. Then, I’m back to using the internet and wasting all the time I have. I keep slipping. No matter how much effort i put in, I can't seem to reach my goals. It's hopeless.

When I’m in my ‘sober’ state (like I’m now, as I write), I’m fine, I can see clearly, but then, when I crave for the internet, it’s like I’m another person. And I’ve been that other person for 6 years now. That’s more than a third of my life. I feel like being addicted to the internet has become a part of my identity. I even had high-power glasses now. People think it’s because I study so much. Lord, only if they knew. My eyesight is so bad that I worry I’ll go blind one day. But I really can’t stay away. I’ve tried installing website blockers but, those don’t work on me anymore. It’s futile. I feel hopeless. I’m so tired. I’ve been running in circles for years now, I wish this could stop.

I have been through my share of psychological troubles as well. I don’t like to speak about this, so I’ll keep this short. 2 years before I started watching porn, I myself was molested by some old sick guy in a swimming pool, at my friend’s birthday party. I didn’t even know what molestation was then, this still rips my heart. Growing up, I’ve seen all kinds of inappropriate photos on my dad’s phone, that belonged to other guys’ private parts. I still don’t know; we don’t talk about this (and will never) but it was only natural to conclude that he was gay. I knew that he used Grindr, and cheated often. My mum knows it too, and we did have a lot of violent fights about it. My dad has hit my mum many times and my mum has wreaked havoc multiple times as well. Divorce has been brought up often. It’s like the whole family has split personalities. Also, I'm Asian. So, that really adds up to the whole ""looking good in front of society"" and stuff, I'm not getting into that now.

I just. I really don’t want to justify my disgusting behaviour with all my personal issues, but I don’t know, it feels good to confess everything to the void. I’m so tired right now. I’ve used the internet to escape reality. I really have tried to run away from all my problems. But I think now, I’ve run so far away, that I don’t know my way back. I’m lost. Realistically, the only thing I see is a failure. I’ve never failed significantly in my life before, and if I do right now, I think my parents would react very badly. On paper, we’re the perfect family, but in real life, I’m really struggling. I don’t have the freedom to fail, but I’m so scared I might fail this time. My parents keep saying they don't care about grades, but I still take the pressure. I'm guilty of not working as hard and being addicted to crap, so it's very much my fault.

I need to study more, but I keep getting distracted. What’s worse is if I try to break away from watching dramas, I end up going back to porn. I don’t know what to do. I had once thought I had the strongest will in the entire universe, but now, I feel really shameful and pathetic. I don’t know anyone who has weaker willpower than me. On some days, I feel regret, on the other days, I don’t care about the consequences of my actions. Sometimes I’m glad that I cry about it, cause it’s worse if I don’t. It’s worse when I don’t care at all. I don’t know. I don’t know if I can go back to the talented girl everyone knew and loved. Quarantine had got the worst out of me and each day, I go back to the internet.

The reason I’m writing this is to promise myself for the 10000th time I’ll stop. I don’t want to ruin my life. I don’t care about what I feel, cause if I keep caring about my personal fantasies, it’ll be too late. My parents, no matter how fucked up they might be, they care a lot. They support me through everything. They are genuinely great parents, if not husband and wife. I don’t know if my ‘addicted’ self wants to stop or not, but I need to stop and focus on my education. I feel like I’ve been addicted all my life, so I don’t know if I can even live a life that’s free of internet addiction. But, I really want to try. Once again. I’m just tired. I can’t recognise myself anymore.

Any advice or thoughts are appreciated.",13

2020-11-16 18:42:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jvi2gh/person_addiction/,Person Addiction,"I’ve never been truly addicted to anything but sex and women. 3 years ago, I met what I thought was the perfect woman. Long story short, she wasn’t. I got her pregnant 3 months into dating. We tried being together long term (living together, sharing life) but the relationship was a train wreck. After many months of ongoing relations, she abruptly moved on to another man 2 months ago. This kind of rocked my world, though it is for the best.

The problem I’ve discovered is that I became absolutely addicted to this person due to the narcissistic abuse that I suffered in the relationship. Adding coparenting into the mix, it has become a nightmare. She fuels the fire as well, but I tend to initiate the arguments and conflict. 2 months later we are still arguing about the relationship and who did what. This has majorly effected my life. After she initially spilled the beans that she’s moved on (less than 24 hours after ending things with me) I began to start withdrawing. Depression, anxiety, loss of appetite, etc. My therapist observed this and affirmed that I have an addiction to a person. Her usage of intermittent reinforcement always kept me waiting for a little positivity or hope—but the truth is she is a bad person.

I did dodge a bullet. I called off the wedding. She left. I avoided a much longer train wreck relationship and don’t lose half of everything I own. I am relatively successful, but I’ve done absolutely nothing since she came into my life. I dropped out of college. I didn’t even realize what was going on at the time. But I’m here now, fully involved in my daughter’s life, still have a job, visiting the gym, and my appetite is returning. But the battle is not over.

I am still addicted to this woman, even while knowing she’s fucking another man. But this evening, for my daughter, I’ve decided that I will no longer be an addict. I will no longer live my days trying to get some kind of response out of her mother. I will not be the person I was in the past. I will not let my life waver due to the choices of another person. I will no longer let her influence my success, my moods, or my choices. I will wish her peace and happiness, and I will act in kindness and love. But for now, I am to keep my distance and no longer contact her. I am committing to at least 30 days of no contact (besides communicating about our child.) 

I will utilize these 30 days to return to my fitness, focus on my job, obtain my real estate license, and create a much better future for my daughter. I love myself enough to not let this control me. I love my daughter even more so that I want her to have a father. I don’t want her to only see pictures of him and hear stories because he committed suicide. I will conquer my codependency before I enter another romantic situation, and I will put my daughter first always.",3

But I don’t know how to tell my parents or family. I feel like I’ll be disowned and on my own.,"My addiction started when I started at a pizza place. Everyone did coke and while I’d tried it before with no problems, they were giving it to me constantly for free every day. That is, until I was hooked. And as I struggled with anorexia it felt like a miracle drug to me. At my peak I was doing $200 a day. While I’ve gotten myself down to $80 a day, it’s been a secret from everyone in my life just how bad of a problem it is and how little control I have over myself anymore. I also struggle with depression, anxiety, ptsd, agoraphobia, and panic disorder (all diagnosed before my addiction). 

I just went to the ent after weeks of an excruciating headache and it turns out I have a large septum perforation due to a deviated septum trapping the coke against my septum for long periods of time.

This is my wake up call.... but I still can’t manage to stop. I do it in secret. And hide it from everyone. I’m terrified to get help or tell my parents because I feel like I know their reaction. And that’s cutting me off and out of their lives. They always warned me I have an addictive personality and I didn’t listen. And now I don’t know what to do. Someone please help me.",8

He's kind of hitting that point where it can kind of all go downhill soon. His Family and a few other close friends have planned to essentially stage an intervention without any professional help, and abduct him and leave him out of the city for 1-2 months.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now this sounds really dumb to me. I'm not a professional I'm working on my undergrad right now but I just can't see this working. When I brought up seeking counsel for a patter plan I was told he didn't have any mental health issues so it wasn't required(He clearly has his own mental health problems..). Once I talked them into researching it or working with me on it, they essentially said theres no one doing in person visits(Which isn't even accurate).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What I'm looking for is information more-so on the Family/Friends resource side. Is there any easy way to even have a better plan to assist this person outside of kidnap them ? Would a counselor sit down and assist with a plan ? Or at least talk them out of their current one ?",1
2020-11-16 13:32:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jvc5dg/i_decided_to_get_sober_last_night/,I decided to get sober last night.,"ETA: 24 days sober for anyone who cares! 

25F. I’ve been a high functioning addict for a while now and my ability to handle it & function started to slip about a month ago. I’ve been abusing alcohol, adderall, and “party drugs” since I was about 16. This past weekend I was a nightmare of a person in my college town. My behavior scared me, I have not been thinking clearly or rationally for a while now and it’s going to ruin my life. Saw a Reddit comment last night from someone giving advice about getting off adderall and it really put me in perspective. For the last 9 years I’ve been “partying hard” which I’m realizing is actually severe substance abuse. Im not having fun anymore, I’m not sure if I was ever having fun or when it stopped being fun. Just because I’ve managed to keep a good job, pay bills, and participate in society all while getting inexplicably fucked up does not mean I have been living a good life. I decided that I’m going to sober up and get my shit together. 

I already feel like shit today coming down off of everything. This is the first day since 2013 I haven’t taken an adderall. I got rid of all the booze+drugs in my house last night. I am not going to buy cigarettes today like I usually do. I plan on telling my brother about everything and giving over my adderall tonight. I’m talking to a friend tonight to admit to her what’s going on with me and apologize for being a bad friend, hoping I can rebuild our relationship up. This is going to be really hard but I’ve got to do it. I will ruin my life or end up dead if I don’t. 

I want to be a good friend & family member, I want to remember your birthday, I want to know that I’m going to feel good when I wake up tomorrow. I want to be a better employee. I want to remember milestones in my life and I don’t want to accidentally manipulate other people because I was drunk or so cracked out on adderall that I didn’t even realize I was using someone as a pawn to make myself happy. 

I feel like I have had it all together for so long. But recently I just started going so much harder than ever before and it is going to fuck my life up. I could barely breathe yesterday I had put so much pressure on my cardiovascular system over the weekend. The things I did and said are not representative of the person I want to be in life. Most importantly, that behavior will never allow me to achieve the things I want to. 

I want to live a healthier life, fix relationships I’ve ruined, and get a sense of stability. The alcohol, the adderall, recreational drug use(cocaine, Molly, mushrooms, acid, Xanax), weed - I’ve got to stop using all of them. It’s bad for my body but coupled together the way I’ve been using them it’s put me in a nightmare of mental position, I have been a devastating version of myself. It’s time for me to get my shit together because I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Wish me luck!",9
2020-11-16 13:31:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jvc4jq/a_relapse_am_i_a_pickle/,"A relapse: Am I a ""pickle""?","There's a concept for addicts: a cucumber can become a pickle but a pickle can never go back to being a cucumber. That is to say, a person with an addiction is able to recover if he pushes past his discomfort, sets boundaries, and follows through with recovery plans. The addict doesn't rationalize or lie to himself, and he stops bad habits over time. A cucumber is someone who makes excuses and constantly does worse and worse, with little hope of recovery because they aren't truly trying. They just say they are, but really they're in too deep.

I relapsed twice since my commitment and it really bothers me. I feel such strong frustration after the relapse because I say ""I can't believe I did that."" But at the moment, the urge is just too strong.

Addiction is rough, and it's a horrible disease, but I'm hopeful I can do better next time. Fall down 7 times, get up 8, right? I hope I'm right in saying I'm a cucumber, that I'm not a pickle with no hope to revert.",3

My meth addiction started about 1 month ago.
I wasn’t really addicted in the beginning. I used Meth when I  had to pull endless all-nighters for design school,  or when I’d work a 40hr weekend + projects and I couldn’t sleep. (Chronic insomnia for 24 years). 

I’ve tried just about every drug out there and never became addicted so this is bananas..
I think the shitty life obstacles that had just been thrown at me last week mentally dragged me into becoming addiction.
  
 I’ve been depressed as shitt for probably 3+ years now. And I am a cluster fuck with adhd and have to be constantly doing things or I lose it..
  I am about to tryout my bupropion prescription for anxiety, depression, addiction? Has anyone tried this medication for addiction or depression?    Also, if I am weening off of meth (Super Low doses) will this medication kill me due to interaction?
       I’ve looked into rehab facilities but I feel like    I can do this at my house and just get a therapist.. 

I’m in need of some help finding support groups, and people to talk to... last week I moved back to Florida and where I’m located doesn’t really have good meet ups. I was going to join this one group for crystal meth anonymous with zoom but idk...
Any advice? 

I’d love to talk to someone experiencing the same struggle or someone who beat addiction.

I’d been taking cold tablets that contain both incessantly for a few months (3-5 pills on average) - mostly to ease constantly clogged nose, headache and, I must admit, anxiety. They made me feel more relaxed and enabled me to cope with a rather stressful work environment. Then I stopped, getting worried about my liver. 

But last week, I started taking them again, with the excuse of curing a cold - granted, I had a cold but I know that I don’t really need them anymore. Last night, I made up my mind to put a stop to this, because I felt they had had a profoundly negative impact on my mind - I felt I was somehow getting emotionally detached (as if I were becoming an observer of myself) and my mind kept wandering off in a foggy state.

So I haven’t taken any today and, to be honest, it’s been a rough day - a terrible headache, a hint of nausea and a toothache (which is weird, because I went see a dentist the other day and everything got sorted out). Emotionally, I’m a bit irritable and finding it difficult to focus on one task.

I have recently quit vaping/nicotine and I'm about 10 days in. I feel like I am at that point where I need something to seriously substitute the cravings. I guess I don't really get cravings for nicotine anymore but I'm just itching for something, or some sort of stimulation. At first, I would just go for some straight whiskey on the rocks, but now more recently I just want more and more and I feel I am getting mean with it. I am looking for more advice rather than sympathy or support.

Other than resorting to alcohol, I just reach for goldfish crackers, a strip of gum, or even just blowing a load. But even doing that I am tired of. I am only a college student, and when I pour a glass of bourbon I sense near-future whiskey-abuse. Would switching to something like vodka or wine be a more healthy route? (and I know drinking may not be healthy, but hey its college).

I definitely feel better since quitting, but I have been experiencing some side effects, specifically insomnia, hence resorting to alcohol to help sleep. I have tried sleeping pills but they do not work well, as I still struggle to fall asleep before 4AM.

I am kinda worried, but I know advice would be ""Time will tell"" or ""be patient, it'll get better."" Any Thoughts??",1

My boyfriend (31) got Xanax prescribed after some really crazy things he went through a couple of years ago. He got them before any other psychological help en got addicted very soon. After a year he tried to get off it but started drinking more and more. Now 4 years, a very severe alcohol/benzo addiction, and 2 rehabs later, he is sober for 3 weeks. In the last years he could only get sober for max 2 weeks but then he did weed, phenibut, or kratom. Now, this morning he called me and i knew something is off. He sounded weird... I think it's kratom since there is a metallic smell (is there anything else possible with that smell)? I used to say that I want those shit (kratom etc) gone because him being in such 'another state of mind' gives me so much anxiety linking it to his very drunk periods. I love him, so so much and i want to support him, he wants to get better but he keeps on grabbing this stuff because he says it keeps him sober (never long but yeah).... Also, i feel like saying i will leave if this doesn't stop, but when he is sober i just cant because i love him and when he's drunk i can't because he is so suicidal and i couldn't live with the thoughts of me being able to prevent him if ii would've been there.

i'm so stuck, so scared. I hate alcohol, i hate al those fucking mind-messing stuff. He is amazing but all of those things make him a monster.

A while back I found a makeshift bong (a plastic bottle with a hole in it) which my on off (currently off) cocaine addict boyfriend hid under my couch (he will take anything going but coke is The main thing followed by benzos) 

At the time I was outraged for many reasons but mainly as drugs are a no go for him at my place and he’s supposed to be on a programme. My first thought was that it was for crack due to the extremely pungent chemical smell. He said it was weed and the smell would’ve been for the burning plastic. I didn’t smell any weed In the air in the flat for example.

What do you guys think, would a weed bong still omit that kinda smell or was this likely something harder?

Honestly just want to talk to people who understand.,Ive been addicted to opioids now for 10 years im now 26. Started with pills graduated to dope about 3 years ago. I take suboxone to keep me on track (prescribed) but sometimes I find myself taking steps backwards. I recently started working again and it seems to be a trigger when pay day arrives. Last week I decided I would purchase 25 bags then when they were gone get back on my subs. Before this I stayed clean for 2.5 weeks. I cant really say I have any issues that make me want to use just want to when I can afford it. With that being said its so hard to save money and I know I can't do this forever being broke sucks. I spend hundreds and have nothing to show for it so depressing. Any one went through something similar? If so how do you fight the erge? Is it time to finally get into a 30 day program?  Maybe start going to meetings? I dont know how to stop this behavior like i said before I can go a few weeks not even wanting to use then just one day my mind decides I want to im not sure what to do.,1
2020-11-15 00:24:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jugqh7/exboyfriend_overdosed_2_weeks_ago_i_dont_know_how/,Ex-boyfriend overdosed 2 weeks ago. I don't know how to process my feelings.,"This is extremely long.

I dated my ex-boyfriend from early 2010 to the end of 2013. Prior to us dating, he had been sober for a few years. I never did learn his drug of choice when he was using, but knew that he did drink alcohol a lot. Our relationship was great and then the honeymoon phase petered out, and the addictive tendencies and toxic behavior reared their ugly heads.

He was abused severely as a child and neglected. He left home at 13 and never looked back. Eventually, he ended up moving 4 hours away to live with his grandmother. She essentially raised him and left him to care for the house and her tenants while she was in Poland for half the year. He struggled intensely with feelings of abandonment and feeling like he wasn't good enough for anyone, nor worthy of love.

I was 19 when I first started dating him. He was my first serious boyfriend (moved in together, received a promise ring, etc). As a young person, I didn't know how to effectively deal with those problems on my own. I constantly encouraged him to seek therapy, while he long ago convinced himself therapy/AA/counseling was useless. 

At some point, the drinking escalated. The talks of suicide became more frequent. I came home once to every knife in the house on this bed, him sobbing in the corner. Another night, he threatened his life with 2 knives to his neck. He was becoming borderline physical that night. I left the house, but I couldn't physically leave the driveway. He pinned his head behind my back tire and we played a game of chicken until I safely made it out and called police. He was ordered by the courts to attend counseling and got slammed with a weapons charge. 

I still went back. I went back every single time. I lost my own father to suicide, he struggled with addiction, and so I felt like I couldn't lose a second person I loved so much to the same fate. 

When he was sober, our relationship was story-book. He treated me like a queen. As soon as he had a drink, it brought his demons to the forefront. For almost 4 years, we did this dance. He fought to stay sober. We argued too often, I felt codependent more than in love with him, and the damaged relationships with my family broke my heart. It all just reached a tipping point.

I knew this wasn't sustainable and if he didn't want to help himself, I couldn't save him. It was sad. He had pushed everyone away from him and only had his coworkers left to pick up the pieces. I vividly remember the feeling of driving away after I ended things and I felt infinitely lighter. He sent me an email a few days later stating he understood why I made my decision but was desperate for my friendship. He had a laundry-list of changes he wanted to make and wanted my help. Sorry? No. Not after the figurative shit-kicking I took. I can't be there to potentially watch him spiral further into his disease. I loved him, but I just couldn't emotionally do it anymore.

He made repeated attempt to reach out. I never responded. I didn't feel like it was healthy for me. Also, due to his past behavior, I was afraid of what he was capable of. I didn't want to be around him anymore. He would text me happy birthday, mention he saw my boyfriend around town/liked his car (which made me question his intentions), I found out he was showing photos of my family to his friends who would randomly stop them on the street and talk to them like family. It all made me uncomfortable, so I blocked his number almost 2 years ago.

My brother in law saw him last year at a store and said he looked rough, his teeth were rotting, but he seemed happy. I was slightly worried, but knew that wasn't my burden to bare.

I woke up 2 days ago to a message from an estranged friend that my ex overdosed overnight on the 2nd of November and wasn't found until the morning by his grandmother. He texted his friend/tenant he was going for a walk downtown (obviously to buy drugs), and no one heard him hit the floor. He was gone. I learned he had started dating a girl a few years ago who was into every drug available. He got into fentanyl, meth, every thing. She survived an overdose, but he got scared and broke up with her. He started to get clean again. Last year, his father died of suicide. I know he always longed to repair that relationship, he just didn't know how. I'm sure it crushed him to never have that chance. He then lost his job in the mines because he had a dirty urine test. He had also lost his license for, like, the 4th time due to driving wrecklessly. He was due to get it back on the 11th. The night he overdosed, he had made plans with his best friend to get things in order to go on the 11th for his road test.

I learned every drug registered in his last urinalysis but weed. I was also told he was drinking 6 L of wine a day, but was slowly weaned off by his friend. He had totaled 4 cars and couldn't even register the last 3 in his name. He had supposedly agreed to enter rehab recently in order to get his job in the mine back, but COVID put a damper on that.

When I found out, it was too late to attend the funeral. He will be buried in a town 4 hours away, a town he loathed with every fibre of his being. Based on what I heard about the funeral and who was in attendance (his abusive step dad and mom), I am glad I didn't go.

I am, however, a basket case. I left out so much of what I went through with him for brevity's sake. I loved him so much when we were together and I had to sever the cord while still deeply in love with him, otherwise he would've taken me down with him. I am now dealing with intense feelings of regret for not being more receptive to his attempts at reaching out. In the moment, I felt some of his comments were inappropriate and I also just didn't want to speak to him because I was still filled with so much anger.

The new friends he made, who never got a chance to meet me, got in contact with me. They said he had always told them we were engaged (I only ever got a promise ring). He never spoke a bad word about me and apparently spoke about me up until the day he died. They said he loved me very much and it was just something he never got over. I lined up the times he tried to get in touch with me, and it's while he was dating his ex. I guess he never made peace with our relationship ending. I feel such regret because maybe he really did need my friendship. Every single friend of his has heard about me and all kept saying ""he thought so highly of you"" ""you are such a good person"", etc. I don't know how much my refusal to speak to him contributed to his downward spiral, but I was told it got really bad after our break up. I just have so much regret and guilt for not being there, even though he clearly had such great friends in his life who were actively trying to get him clean. And that's just it, right? He had people who loved him helping him get clean, and even then, it didn't make a difference.

I don't know what to do. Objectively I know that I did what was right for me at the time, and I know he probably would've spiraled regardless of me being in his life or not, but I'm sick to my stomach with guilt and I can't make it go away.",11

I have been married to my husband for 7 years and we have 3 beautiful children together that absolutely adores him. He is a great father but we have one issue...I’m pretty sure he has an addiction. He has been on Merhadone since he was 19 (30 now) and I accepted that. He is perfectly fine except he has been dabbling besides. I have exhausted all efforts to try and make it work. But he’s very good at manipulating and making it seem like I am not giving him the benefit of the doubt that he has stopped. When you know you just know. I can see it in his eyes and the way he acts. I also recently just found a Xanax bar in my car which of course he denies. I ask to drug test him and he gets offensive. We had a great heart to heart the other night where I told him I couldn’t take much more. I thought that would be the end of it...til I woke up and looked at him. I love him so much and it’ll break the kids heart if I leave but I don’t know what else to do. Please any insight would be amazing.,7

Stopped for a bit when I was 16-22 and then started drinking Heavily until I was 29.

I got help through Smart Recovery and started seeing a therapist and psych.

I’m 31 and officially relapsed.

I’ve said that a few times this year but I am officially hiding it and successfully.

I dont drink before nor during work, thankfully, but once it hits 5:00pm, I’m fantasizing about when my next drink will be.

Not even my bff has noticed. I drank some of her beers last time I was over that I have to find a way to dispose of later tonight. I am bringing her some replacements, however, so I’m sure if she hasnt noticed yet, this will be a sure fire way to get her to realize.

I mean, i have to admit I drank some.

Addiction is so fucking hard.

I dont want to sit in my bed and shake after work like before when I quit when I was 29.

It’s always been the same - I dont get blackout, I just drink to a certain point and stay in that sector. I’ve blacked out maybe 4 times in my life.

I’m sure there are others who drink more than me but at my height, I was at a handle of whiskey every 2 days and a 30pack of beer every 3. Drinking both together. I’d start with the whiskey and then have a few beers. Then a few beers in the morning.

Im lacking motivation. I basically quit for someone else  and now im looking for any *real* reason to quit because, apparently my health isnt enough.

TL;DR

Got brutally fired from a job I didn’t love but had worked my ass off to get to as a career and was looking forward to the next 10 years of struggle to reach my next goals.  

I’d started a little pot and cigs again the last 2 years after some numbing prescriptions from doc 3 years ago.  (Worst withdrawal ever off of those btw.  ) so now I’ve been smoking a pack a day and have been stoned everyday day since May.  

I’m proud that I have said no to much harder stuff during this time as I reconnected with some old friends.  But now I have a wife, kids mortgage.   

I’m seriously terrified of cleaning up again.  I OD’d on coke in college and had to clean myself up. Did it on my own.  My wife was actually my goal, ha. She said no way to me when we first met and 2 years later when I tried again we only dated for 6 weeks.  

Let’s just say it’s no fairy tale and being high keeps me mellow and away from anger.  I have a job paying very little but just enough.  I’m home with my kids 3 days a week teaching them.  Honestly, I’m living the dream.  Except that I’ve got an overactive brain and am bored out of my mind.  I gave up on a degree in engineering when I was a drug addict as well as again when I was clean 2 years.  

Now that pots legal I’m in a conundrum.  I made it til 4pm today with no pot for the first time since getting fired.  I kept busy and then got high when I finally was bored.  I feel good. But if I start at 8am I’m blasted all day.  

Ok. Sorry. I think I just needed to dump a little of this somewhere.   

My next goal is to lose a bunch of weight and go play ice hockey again.  Maybe this knee needs a tweaking in the other direction.  

After that I need to figure out how to get back to being a good role model for my kids.",1

I currently just got out of a relationship with someone who has a relationship with Lady H. He was living (maybe) a sober life from March to August 2020. In August he relapsed and started to use several times a week again. His birthday was on Oct 18. He told me no H would be involved. We stayed in his favorite hotel from Saturday to Sunday. Saturday we walked around the small town where we stayed at while tripping on acid. The whole acid trip was him telling me he couldn’t believe he was babysitting me on his birthday and that his dealer told him he would take an uber down to us (50 min drive) to five him 3.5 g free H. I got upset and told him I wanted no part in it. We went back to our hotel and fucked. After we fucked we sat in the bathroom together while I prepared a bubble bath and he told me ‘i wanted to actually punish/harm you during sex this time’. I asked him what he meant and told him I was scared. He told me not to worry and that he was gonna take his benzos and go to sleep. Before taking the benzos he kept texting his dealer. We went out to get something to eat. The rest of the night turned into him playing back and forth with his dealer. His dealer eventually told him he got robbed in the uber and lost the free H. When we got back to the hotel he took his benzos and fell asleep. 

I didn’t sleep. I was still awake from the L and was paranoid from what he had just said. I waited for it to be 9am. I got dressed and went to go get us coffee and some breakfast. He was on his phone all morning. I assume back to talking with his dealer. We went to go get lunch and decided to go to a museum afterwards. While walking towards to the museum he asked me if I could drive him up to his dealer. He said after that we could continue celebrating his bday. I told him I didn’t want to and I didn’t want to be involved. He started walking at a fast pace in another direction and I asked him where he was going. He told me he could catch a train in ten min so he could get his H. I asked him how he was getting back home since he only had $20 and he told me he’d sneak his way back onto the train. I said ok. I realized in that moment he had my car keys.

I knew that I had to be nice and gentle. I asked him ‘could I please have my keys back so I can go home?’ This is where it all began. He didn’t to give me my keys back. I asked him several times. When I realized he wasn’t going to give them back and was running towards my car I started yelling (we were in a highly trafficked main st.) ‘SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP ME’. He started acting like he didn’t know me. 

I caught up to him and grabbed him by his coat and scarf. I told him to give me my keys. In response he grabbed my hair right near my scalp. His grip became tighter and I felt my hair being ripped off. I let go of him and said ‘you win’ crying in defeat. I realized in that moment that while i ran after him my purse had fallen in the middle of the road. We both ran to it. He grabbed it first and threw it to the middle of another road. I stopped the cars and grabbed my purse while he kept running towards my car. 

I didn’t know what to do so I ran back and told him I was calling his mom. He slowed down and told me he would give me my keys. I hung up and when I was going to grab them he grabbed me by the hair/l near my scalp again and tried to push me down to the sidewalk but i resisted. He let go of me and ran off. I ran after him but couldn’t catch up. He started mocking and laughing at me. I ran to my car and started yelling for help. I started yelling that i didnt know what to do. People were circling us in their cars. A man came out and told me to call 911 while he chased after my ex.

The police came and arrested him. He was charged, faces criminal charges and has two restraining orders protecting me from two states (we are both from two small neighboring states). 

He has tried to contact me and blames me for everything. He is twisting the events saying that I had an anger episode. That I was yelling that he was trying to hurt me before anything had escalated. He has had his drug dealer contact me on his behalf.

I changed my phone number and told the police my ex called me from his mom’s phone number (I have the call log). 

I feel horrible that this is all happening to a person I trusted and loved. I feel so guilty. I feel like none of this at the end is gonna help him and is probably going to make his situation worse. I know how stigmatized addiction is and how treating him like a criminal might not do shit but I had to protect myself.

The convict code almost requires a blithe indifference to any calendar. Counting days can drive a man insane; 6 months to the door is generally considered the appropriate time to start thinking about release.

Even so, I can’t help making mental notes in regards to important milestones:

In four days Ill have officially made it two years at the same joint. Three weeks from now will mark the one year anniversary of my first release date.

I received my last visit nine months ago, which was not only the last time visits were allowed, but was also the last time that I had hugged another human being. I haven’t had any kind of physical contact more intimate than a handshake or fist pound since January.

My unofficial count is two years, five months, and two weeks since I last felt a woman’s touch. (Or is it one week and six days?) I was arrested two years, five months, two weeks, and one day ago.

Prison is starting to wear on me. I’m falling into fits of despair. Maybe it’s the cold weather. Maybe it’s just election anxiety.

I’m certain a lot of it is due to the quarantine that’s been imposed on the prison because of positive covid tests. No visits, limited yard. We get 45 minutes in the morning to go outside, save the walks to and from the chow hall. It’s dehumanizing. I wonder how bad lockdowns in the world are.

The whole compound has been getting tested once a week for two months now. No one has ever exhibited symptoms or actually been sick. It wasn’t until the third week that anyone even tested positive. Those unfortunate souls are whisked away across the street for medical surveillance.

The lack of privileges in the positive-test quarantine unit has it functioning like the hole. Every positive case has eventually returned after a few weeks, their test being deemed a false positive.

Watching the media’s fearmongering about corona virus (with its transparent political goals) makes me question how reliable those covid numbers are. I’m a skeptic by nature and the limited data I’ve seen suggests a starkly different than the one painted by the mainstream media. They claim to be pro-science but they have a poor grasp of the numbers.

I don’t have the internet and don’t see social media, so my only source of information is tv, but I feel like cable news is rife with the kind of disinformation and “fake news” they complain about.

Plus, their track record of dishonesty is stunning. When someone or something is trying to convince me of something without evidence, but through assertion and shaming, my bullshit detector goes off.

They never break down the numbers in detail so viewers can know what the real danger is to the average person. Like, how many more deaths do we have this year than the average year? Can someone tell me that? That’s not a rhetorical question, I really want to know.

That number would be a better indicator of the true impact of coronavirus rather than the total number of deaths without any context. The U.S. is a country of 350 million people after all.

I’ve only heard it reported once that 41% of covid deaths occurred in assisted-living facilities. That population is at-risk for death, period, and not just from covid. Moreover, how many positive cases are just false positives like we’ve had over and over?

I have a feeling that when the smoke clears and we can dispassionately assess this pandemic, we’ll look on with horror at the lies, distortions, and obfuscations in a way that’ll make the false reports of Iraq’s WMD program look like a harmless white lie.",1
2020-11-14 13:03:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ju6763/ambien_addiction_15yrs_of_30mg120mg/,"ambien addiction, 15yrs+ of 30mg-120mg","**Note**: Most people do not find ambien as recreational as I do and I do not see too much information on the dangers of long-term use aside from one-off trainwreck stories. I would like to share my experience as a functional ambien addict as well as seek any advice in the comments on suggestion. 

&#x200B;

**Story**

I have abused drugs for 15+ years, including having a severe benzo addiction, but Ambien/Zolpidem has been my drug of choice. I am in my 30's now. I was always anxious with sleep issues growing up and when I learned (as a teenager) that people can get high on ambien: I began taking 30mg and drinking beer/smoking pot to vibe out and relax every night. In the process I've been addicted to many drugs which were awful to quit, including benzos and opioids, but ambien has been my crutch for as long as I can/cannot remember in my adult life. 

&#x200B;

I've always found Ambien to be a very forgiving drug. Using the brand name extended release there was something in it that made me throw up at 40mg+. However with the generic 10mg I've always been able to enjoy more. Being a high anxiety person (a 2mg bar made me normal but that is a different story) I was able take high doses of ambien and still function until I would black out on 60mg+. This has continued daily and has became very recreational despite many embarrassing moments, arrests, broken relationships. 

&#x200B;

Although I was able to quit benzodiazpenes or minimize use, I do believe that withdrawal has never left me and the timing has been regulated to daily ambien use. I experience the same symptoms including severe panic attacks during the day and do not feel I've ever stopped taking benzos although I do not require them. If I am to take ativan/xanax/klonopin/valium - I go into a severe withdrawal as soon as it wears off where life is absolute hell and I cannot even leave my house. 

&#x200B;

Every night for 15+ years I have used ambien starting at 30mg and sometimes going as far as 120mg. 15 years later I need an average 30mg-40mg to enjoy a slight high and numb the stress of my day and go to bed. 

&#x200B;

Somehow throughout this period I was always able to maintain a career and high-paying job, however my own mental state and personal relationships have suffered. My sober memory and learning abilities are still great but blackouts are regular every week and it is not weird to me to not remember how I went to sleep. This includes a lot of bad decisions and erratic behavior around friends/family/partners. 

&#x200B;

Every severe blackout is a wake up call (and so was every arrest). 

&#x200B;

Long overdue but I have reached a point where I can no longer function socially or at work without feeling severe withdrawal. This includes social anxiety/depression/panic attacks/GI issues/ringing in years/sweating/twitching. Ambien allowed me to have a high-stress job and black out then start over, but at some point over the last 7 years I have become very reliant on ambien and I can count on two hands how many nights I've slept without it. 

&#x200B;

It was not unusual for me to wake up on a weekend (no work), pop 30mg and enjoy my day with redosing 20mg at a time until I would eat 200mg. I've never gotten physically sick from such bad ideas but the depression/anxiety has become unmanageable. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Happy to answers any questions, but this story is not meant to be a train wreck of stupidity but rather exist for those with long-term ambien addiction. I am not comfortable substituting a benzodiazepene due to the fear of withdrawal and have not ever been honest about this issue with a clinical physician. 

&#x200B;

This is the first weekend I've decided to not get fucked up on ambien and fix myself. I'm not worried about seizure risk yet and have ambien/klonopin/ativan at my disposal. However over the last 3 nights I've taken my dose down to 20mg and its been absolute hell. I'm only sleeping 4 hours and require more sleep to be less awkward at work. 

&#x200B;

I have begun taking melatonin regularly to help regulate sleep but am **looking for suggestions/experiences on what is manageable or recommended to taper down.** It took 5+ years of recreational use to get this way although they say ambien is not addictive I hope to get back to normal before it ruins my life.",4

The universe showed me repeatedly how to heal myself, I ignored the signs- too petrified to open Pandora’s Box, believing that I would crumble at the enormity of the task. 
My life's memories were blighted with tales of murder, suicide, addiction and abuses of every kind, the task seemed insurmountable, and in my mind impossible. The more I ignored the universal messages, the louder they got, until I reached the place of do or die.
In my crumpled, dis-eased state, I decided to live, I decided to finally practice what I preached. I prayed for a way through the darkness and for strength to confront my pain and I meant it, and literally overnight- the desire to sedate was at a manageable level. I meditated, affirmed, I ate well, I exercised, I sat in nature, I grounded myself.  Most importantly, I faced the pain that had held me prisoner, and what I learned was surprising. 
It's so much harder and more damaging to run from the pain than it is to feel it, the effort it takes to distance yourself from the scars is so much more exhausting than it is to heal them.
I've been two years dependency-free as of yesterday, and the life I have now I consider a miracle, everyday is an authentic, honest day. The signs, synchronicities and spiritual support are now obvious because my mind is clear enough to notice them. The victim is healed and the peaceful warrior reigns supreme over all the decisions I make. There are still moments of suffering- don't get me wrong, only now, they are being dealt with and processed rather than being sedated and avoided.
There is always a way, it's not too late for you, just make the choice and mean it and a new miraculous future is yours.

I've been having a hard time lately and I recently started an adhd medication that's help clear out a lot of the depressing and intrusive thoughts that caused me to cut in the first place.
Although it is still an addiction that I'm stuck to, the triggering intrusive thoughts have helped the need and urge to selfharm at all lessen.
I'm very thankful for this medication, but my anxiety has gone through the roof. I'm having panic attacks when I go in public areas as a side effect of the pills.
I have to pick my mental health problems over worsening mental health problems. I just can't tell what's worse.

Pros to keep taking the meds:
- Adhd is calmed down
- less intrusive thoughts
- less depression
- less suicidal thoughts
- I can do my school work for once
- my passions are slowly coming back
- less heart palpitations and racing heart
- peace of mind (most of the time)

Cons to keep taking my medication:
- worsening anxiety
- more anxiety induced non-verbal episodes
- more stress
- 1-4 panic attacks a day
- more eczema (stress related)
- can't have too much caffeine
- anorexia has spiralled out of control due to weight loss side effects

Honestly, I just feel completely boned, between a rock and a hard place, or whatever you wanna call it. I'm lost during a time where I have the most mental clarity I've ever had.

Tl;dr : adhd medication helps and makes me feel worse.",3

I love storytelling, the theatrics, and the fantasy.

I find that tv becomes my best friend when I’m anxious or depressed. It’s a way for me to detach from reality and escape to a different one. And there have been many times I’ve watched hours upon hours. About once a year I find myself in a rut where I cannot get off the couch. 

But since Covid struck and I became unemployed, I can’t control myself. I watched tv ALL day for months, easily 10-12 hours a day. I so want to read, study the occult and get in touch with my spiritual beliefs so i can deal with my mental health. 

Yet I can’t stop myself. It’s not even like I’m lazy, I’ll get up and move to a different room to work. But the withdrawal symptoms kick in. My feet start shaking, I fidget, one time I even sat on the ground and cried bc it was so hard to pull away. I physically feel drawn to my tv like a magnet pulling me. I can’t even shower or wash my face Bc walking away to do anything besides sleep and use the restroom makes my brain go crazy.

I try the simplest of goal setting like “meditate first thing in the morning for 5 min” or “take a walk around the block.” But morning comes and I turn the tv on Bc I forget and I’m stuck. 

Idk if I’m looking for advice. Honestly, I mostly wanted to vent. I think my husband and family just think I’m a lazy dickhead but really, I hate this. I hate it so fckn much but I can’t stop. I want to just throw my tv off my balcony sometimes and even writing this makes tears well up in my eyes bc I feel like such a failure. To my family, friends, and myself.",12

I don’t have the option for inpatient treatment right now. As I relapsed about 5 months ago & kept it quiet. I have the weekend & plan on missing Mon & Tue of work. 

*i don’t believe im breaking any rules by posting this*

But if I am I’ll delete it. I don’t want to romanticize ANY of this CRAP! 

It’s awful. Every time. We all deserve a happy life. It’s really telling that I’m speaking like this at this point as in the past I’d have a defeated mentality due to a relapse. But I know what & who I am, I know I am imperfect. I also know I’m a pretty good person! And I’m excited to see what life has in store for me, in a sober healthy mind state.

So if anyone has any tips for things like night sweats, the cold chills, and body aches I’d love to hear from you! Those issues are always the worst for me.

Anyway, everyone be safe, take care!

__UPDATE__ For anyone out there... literally... *anyone?*

- in all seriousness, I folded. I was 36 hours from my last use & gave in. The only good I can say from this is, I copped & used just enough to stop the worst of the aches. In my distorted mind, I have the weekend to myself. So I can let the worst of it really taken its course. For example if this was a Wednesday (work day) id freak before my shit & say I can’t imagine how I’ll feel in the middle of work & tell myself to take enough to get through the day with ZERO symptoms. So I would have used more then just ‘one’ we’ll say. 

But in the end this has scared me way more then the initial relapse. 😞. It just goes to show how heavy I’ve been using and how easily my resolve is broken.

2020-11-13 07:20:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jtg0ok/i_quit_too_many_things_at_once/,I quit too many things at once,"2020, the year I quit everything.

I took a trip mid year and was afforded some time alone to re-evaluate all of my life's choices. On my return home I put in my resignation at my job of 8.5 years. The first thing to go.

I have been a tobacco smoker since I was 16. After 20 years of smoking and only one short-lived attempt at quitting last Christmas, I decided to try again in October.

Also since approximately age 16 I have been a daily pot smoker. Over the past couple of years I have slowed it down to evenings only before bed or when no one is home, because my children are getting older and more observant.  

I have been drinking in excess for the past 13 years. Varying in severity, I would have to admit I have been a functional alcoholic all of those 13 years. At times I would drink 10 cans of premix/cider per weeknight. Starting after work, carrying on while cooking dinner and cleaning, staying ""normal"" until the kids are in bed and then writing myself off with the rest. Weekends were worse. In a phase of drinking less I would have around 6 per night and binge on Friday and Saturdays. 

I hated my job so much, and was do hungover every morning I had an addiction to stopping at the servo for an iced coffee and most of the time a spinach and feta roll, or something to settle my stomach. I associated both of these things with cigarettes not unsimilar to how I crave one with an alcoholic drink, so I quit that too. I started to notice some weight loss so decided to eat clean, cut sugar from my diet completely and start exercising.

I always told myself I would be able to clean myself up if I didn't have to make the changes while going to work everyday. In my drunken, stoned stupor most nights I considered telling my family the extent of my problems in order to get help with the kids while I detox or attend rehab. But I would wake up sober and decide I could never admit it to anyone who is likely to force change upon me.

After quitting my job in September I quit smoking cigarettes (with the aid of Champix) in late October. I have had 3 cigarettes since my quit date, and each were with a drink. So I quit drinking a week after the cigarettes. I joined a dating site out of boredom and met a man who unknowingly inspired me to stop smoking weed too. I would have a smoke and suddenly become withdrawn and paranoid that I'm not who he thinks I am. I have not smoked since.

Today, 3 weeks off ciggs, sugar and take away/junk, 2 weeks off booze and 12 days off weed, I feel like I could scratch my fucking face off. I haven't had a full night's sleep for 2 weeks. I am itchy from head to toe. I'm irritable. My dreams are vividly ridiculous, I'm sleeping with someone I normally would have 👌 zilch in common with and questioning who the fuck I am. I start a new job in a couple of weeks after 2.5 months off. Can I maintain this? Will I ever be able to see my friends again without falling back into old habits? Will this impending sense of doom and loss ever fuck off?

It didn't start off like this, but little by little it progressed to the situation I now get. To put it simple I smell like straight S.H.I.T. when I use now, especially if I do not sleep. Sometimes if I use  very little after a sober streak I'm fine. But if I smoke it or take like two snifs of it my body starts to emit a really foul odor. I understand tweak reak but this is like a whole other level. I can shower 3 times in the same day(its happend) and as soon as I start sweating I start stinking BAD. I feel it has to do with the fact that my ass crack starts to sweat as well. Yet if I have the ac on and I chill out a bit so I won't sweat i still get an odor coming out of my hands,arms, everywhere else. Ive known a couple of users and none of them have this issue. Once in a while one of my friends would to vagas on a weekday and come back to work the next day without showering and with the same clothes on. He would smell sometimes but still wouldn't smell enough for people at long distances to react to the smell way before you even pass them, and that that he hot boxes his car with it. It's unreal how bad the situation gets even with at least 2 daily showers. If i also get a little hint of the smell now and then as i move or get up, I can only imagine what others smell since they aren't used to it since it is not always around them for their brains to shut it out. Has anyone else ever had this issue? If so what helped?

Edit: I've been using for heavy for 5 years with one 8 or 9 month break but then relapsed. The smell changes. Sometimes I smell like ass, amonia, like an unusual sweet smell, ive heard people say ""it smells like burning rubber, garbage, sewage, mold, shit, dick, in here"". Seems no matter how good I upkeep my hygiene it overpowers my body. Even my breath(normal for meth) but like I said I don't know another user whose breath smells so bad even with daily brushing. I have to keep mint, or gum on me ALL DAY. I can fill up an entire house with this smell, and I'm in the room with the door closed. When I open the window its not long before I hear my neighbors complaining about a smell.(I just moved to a new location in February) I feel bad for the up stairs neighbors, I heard them complaining the other day saying ""They need to get their own house on the lott"".... For some crazy fucking reason my wife cannot smell it. I tell her but she says I'm trippen. Yet the days I use her family somewhat avoids coming unnecessarily close to me. I see that they aren't trying to be mean but nothing can hide body language/facial expressions. I see that they don't wanna tell her anything, im assuming because they think that she knows but just doesn't care since we've been together for 10 years and have a 5yr old. The really sad thing is I've been able to hide my use from her all these years. She just thinks I'm really self conscious about my smell/sweat, and that I'm weird for always wanting everything enclosed.(So the smell won't go out and having to hear complaining from people who are passing by or neighbors. As if it wasn't bad enough at work all day) I used daily for 4 years up until the 8-9 month break I had. Since then I try and really limit my use since I know whats going to happen. All this week I haven't went to work because they need me to get a covid test since someone got covid and i was around him. I have been using daily since Saturday, it is now Thursday. So you can imagine how bad the smell is rite now if just one day of use leaves me smelling for at least two days.(The day of use, second day it will start coming down, and the next day it is mostly gone depending if i got enough sleep the 2nd night. I always try to eat and drink plenty of water since I am hiding it from everyone. I know I am not playing EVERYONE stupid but I try to do my best to not act lit. When I go out in public it seems most Latinos can't be played stupid. I'll hear things like "" No mames, lo que ase la pinche droga"" (Fuck, what drugs do to you). Other people just get a wif and start trying to find out what that smell is, the look on their faces when they find out its me is priceless/depressing because if they don't know its drugs they just think I'm a dirty person who just shit himself or stinks really fucken bad. (ps these masks don't even work to help that) The part I hate though is the way they look at my wife as in they can't belive someone can ever be with me, or my child as if they want to make a report to the police. I don't know if my child is as well immune to the smell, or just doesn't say anything because I am a parent. My little family is the reason I stopped for those months and the reason I'm trying to stop again. Its hard to stop when i can't even come out about it to my wife, my family, her family, the only family I can tell use themselves so there's no point if we're both under the same rock...

Back to the point though, have any of you experienced this first hand or known someone who had this problem? If so is there anything I can do(aside from the obvious sobriety). Vitamin, supliments, or maybe it's a defective liver/kidneys. Any advice aside from showering or any other smart remarks. Thanks.",7

this might not seem obvious to most people who i’m close too because i’m good at hiding it and they just see some parts of it. 

i’ve probably been addicted to sugar for over 2 years now but it isn’t getting any easy which i understand is my fault but it’s hard. it mainly started by giving myself treats such as a bar of chocolate because everyone deserves treats right? 

after that i started becoming obsessed with sugary drinks such as caprisun, fruit shoot and energy drinks (mainly redbull) drinking a few of these a week is normally but i probably consume around 25-35 of these a week which i think is a pretty high amount. 

i’ve been getting better at cutting some sugary foods out but it’s very hard when there are so many options around college. (also just letting you know i’m not overweight i’m average weight for my age and height just i feel like i should do something now before it becomes a bigger issue)

does anyone have any tips on this? sorry this might not be as important as another addiction.",7

Seeking support.","Five years ago, I had a problem with Xanax. I don't remember a good 3 months of my life because my friends and I were all binging together during a super crazy time. I stopped after I got seriously hurt (they continued) and my addiction became more one to Adderall, which took years to heal from.

I was sober besides alcohol on weekends for a while, and Kratom to help me not go too hard with alcohol.

I'm prescribed Ativan for panic attacks and high blood pressure spikes/seizures (hasn't been diagnosed officially but acknowledged as that by my doctor over the phone and it definitely felt seizure-like) and have been in scary situations where I legit need them. But I've had a rough year (as we all have) and back in February there were times I'd take 6mg of my 1mg pills to pass out, and was residually ""barred out"" (I call it ""circled out"" because of the shape) the next day. On and off for a few months I'd repeat this behavior; it helped me write and I finished a novel that came out really well according to feedback. Being on Ativan helps unlock my inner conscious and release my inhibitions and I feel like I can only write while on it.

The past three months I've done the same thing: gone through my entire month's prescription (saving 1-2 for an emergency) within a week. This week I had some problems with it though: falling asleep almost immediately. Last night, while on 6mgs and a lot of Kratom, when I was half-asleep I had terrifying hallucinations where I thought that scary witch looking men were at my door, sinisteringly smiling and waving at me.

I really need help but I don't want to tell my psychiatrist this. The med has actually saved me during a super high blood pressure spike/seizure. Idk what to do. I haven't told any of my family or friends except for one I used to do drugs with. I feel so much shame. I want to be able to write without it. Why do I do this and how can I stop?",1

He stays awake for days then crashes, like dead to the world. Also an overweight diabetic with uncontrolled sugar. He says he won't stop t its gone, but won't give me any details. We have small children. He claims his use doesn't affect anyone else, yet he fell asleep driving with them. He will go in the bathroom in early am, and stay til evening. Has bathroom taken over by tools and his porn box. Found all kinds of sex toys,like a pocket p. He looks like crap, spends all day, sometimes asleep in bathroom so no one can go. Other night he added an inside slide lock to keep me from walking in. This was after he cornered me, and i admit i hit him (136 to his 270) and he slugged me in the shoulder. Kids keep hearing us fighting because i can't just act like its normal. He has blown the kids off a few times because he needs to masturbate twice a day. Our day never starts with him til nightime. He will nod out and start talking gibberish. What do I realistically do? He has told me he doesn't care how i feel.

I forgot to add that I get anxiety everytime the bathroom door closes. Of course, I'm doing it to myself.
And the biggest thing I forgot. We are being evicted, and are in the process of buying a cheap home in a total new state. I told him I wasn't sure if I was going to move, as I can't trust him. Since I've said it, he has treated me like crap and keeps telling me Im the only one who thinks it's a big deal.",17

You're just inside the gate. Like you were about to leave, but oddly... just arrived. You're looking at the house with caution. Sadness. I wave from the burnt room. You see me, but through the clearer glass you're not sure if you recognize me. I don't either.

When you see it's me, your face twists for a moment. You don't try to hide it.

You turn, carefully opening the gate before turning back to me. I know why.

Look, I had it quite easy to be honest. My addiction was cocaine and weed, it was hell to overcome but I managed it - I can’t imagine the hell of being addicted to something like Heroin (any opioid) or meth - although I understand meth a little more as my brother was addicted.

I think looking back, what caused me to snowball even further into addiction was putting myself down, thoughts such as “you’ve wasted your life, you’ve let yourself and everyone else around you down” etc, but in truth you’ve made a huge mistake and are now trapped, you are sick , addiction is a disease, and most likely you have other mental illnesses which are now exaggerated.

The starting point I think is to just accept you need help, you don’t have to do it alone. My heart goes out to each and every one of you addicted to whatever drug it may be, but you can look forward to a new future drug free, you are not a bad person, so don’t be so hard on yourself.

Cocaine and alcohol have always been my main demons, but i consider myself a jack of all trades. I suffer from severe depression and bipolar disorder, so its really hard to maintain sobriety when i feel like shit every single day anyways.

2020-11-11 10:56:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jsam7d/my_brothers_keeper/,My Brothers' Keeper,"Hi. This is my first post ever to reddit and I think mainly because I prefer to get my thoughts out in writing. Sorry for the long, drawn-out post.

My brother is fighting opioid abuse and I am scared. He has been very open to me about his use but it is getting worse.

I have two brothers. A twin (We will call him Sal) and my older brother (7 years older who we will call Dustin). I just turned 26 and he is turning 33 in March. Growing up, he was my idol. He still is. He is the kind of guys that is very straight to the point, rough around the edges, stand-offish, but kind. Let's rewind a bit...

1993 - My mom and dad get married on September 21nd. Dustin is their ring bearer and I remember as a kid always watching the old VHS tapes of the wedding - many of which were focused around Dustin. He was a spoiled single child.

1994 - October 28th, 1994 my brother, Sal and I were born. Dustin's life changed forever. Again, watching VHS tapes he was always the ring leader and we were his little henchmen lol. in the videos, we are 99 times out of 100 referred to as ""Boys"" (as in, ""Come on, boys, lets go cause a ruckus"") or ""The Boys"" (as in ""Can the boys come?""). He was my idol. Everything he did, I did. Everywhere he went, I went.

Growing up - We used to make wrestling rings with couch pillows and have wrestling matches. More often than not, it was me and Dustin because Sal was a bit of a cry baby. To this day, Dustin will tell you I was a champ. I took my beatings and never cried to mom or dad. Sal on the other hand... he used to curl into a ball and put his feet up to fight LOL. That wasn't fun so we always teamed up on him. Looking back, I feel bad but we turned out alright (sort of).

Dustin taught me how to ride a bike. He taught me how to skate board. He taught me how to play video games. He taught me all the rappers on BET (LOL). He taught me how to drive. He taught me how to drywall. He taught me how to use a skill saw. He taught me, indirectly, that you don't need to always have on a thick skin. I say indirectly because Dustin ALWAYS had a thick skin on. I know now, that it's unhealthy and unnecessary.

By the time I was around 9 or 10, I started to notice my dad and Dustin getting into arguments. My dad was the most level headed person I have ever met and in speaking of both Dustin and my dad, these two are my greatest role models (for better or worse). Dustin would always be the one starting arguments. He would punch holes in walls (which he always fixed). One Saturday morning, Dustin was playing PlayStation 1 in his room in the basement. My mom was making breakfast sandwiches and called for Dustin to come up. After 30 minutes, someone ate it (I can't remember who). Dustin came upstairs and when he found out someone ate it, he went BERSERK and punched a hole in the wall. We laugh about it to this day and consider it a childhood memory.

A little backstory on my Dad. He was from Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia and was an only child. After working for his dad on his fishing boat from the age of 12, 20 year old Russ travelled to Quebec to work for his Uncle who has a drywall/plaster company. My dad then moved to Ontario to start his own drywall/plaster business which he did for many years. He met a woman and had a daughter (my sister), got married, divorced, then met my mom. We would travel to Nova Scotia EVERY summer to visit my Mamere and Papere. They were always so excited to see us. My Papere passed away in September of 2002 of Lung Cancer when he was 88 years old. My Mamere was a bit of a wreck for many years but with the help of family, she lived for many years on her own and died in 2017 at the age of 93. She loved every second of having us and would have given the shirt off her back for anyone. My dad was very similar.

One year, Dustin must have been 20/21 so I would have been 13/14. Dustin's cell didn't get reception so he asked to use mine for the week. I didn't mind as I was 13/14 so I didn't have friends I was texting anyways lol. Whenever we were down, our friends and family would pretty much flock from all over Cape Breton to come visit us. Our cousins were down and I read a text message that she had sent Dustin and all I read, before I dropped the phone was ""nothing better than kissing you"". MIC DROP. WTF. I ignored it and never said anything.

He must have noticed my discomfort at some point. We were at the fire one night and everyone else had gone it for the night. The stars were always amazing there. As we were hanging out by the fire, he turned to me and told me that dad isn't his real dad.

Rewind to 1988 - Dustin was born to my mother and his father. His father was a dead beat drug addict. My mom and him split and moved to an apartment with Dustin. She had a loving mother and a dad who (as I know now) was a recreational drug user/partier with not much sense of financial stability. At this point, my nan and papa had already been separated.

The day my mom moved in, a guy (Russ) in the building brings her over a case of beer to say hello and he was on his way. Fast forward and the guy and my mom ended up hitting it off and he ended up helping her deal with the abusive breakup with Dustin's biologic father. My mom and Russ were good friends. She started dating someone else but it didn't last. Russ found out through a mutual friend and the friend said ""what are you waiting for"". It sounds a bit cliché, but this is how my mom and dad met/got together. Dustin was just about a year old at this point.

This is all what I have picked up along the way but I never once said anything to anyone about Dustin being our half-brother. He was my brother and he was my idol. It didn't change a thing. He made me promise I wouldn't say anything to Sal because ""he wouldn't get it like you do"". Even though I think me reading that text prompted the spilling of the beans, I have always been close to Dustin and he could always trust me to keep a secret. My Mamere and Papere took Dustin in with open arms and I never got the impression that he was any different than Sal or I. I struggled for a long time with the secret I had to keep. Was it true? Was it a farce to save his hide from kissing our cousin?

Fast Forward to November 19, 2017 - I was working a side job and needed to borrow a tool from my dad so I went over and met him at the door. He was walking towards me rubbing his chest and was complaining about a pain/reflux. I chuckled and said ""take it easy old man don't work too hard"" (he was always working - never stopped unless it was to sleep or spend time with family). I went on my way and came back later that night for dinner. We would always have Sunday dinners at my mom and dads. It was extremely loud as, at this point there are 5 grandchildren (ages 1-5), 4 children, 4 children in-laws, 2 parents, and typically my Nan. At night, everyone would go home except me, my Fiancé and my Nan. We would watch The Walking Dead upstairs (dad hated The Walking Dead). My dad went downstairs to shower while we watched our show. It was a commercial, about 20 mins into the episode and we heard a thud. I laughed and suggested dad was playing another prank. Everyone else was a bit panicked so I said I would go downstairs.

When I got downstairs I heard ragged breathing coming from inside the bathroom. I yelled his name once, twice, and a third time now with panic. I yelled upstairs for help as I strained to open the door and saw him laying on the floor unresponsive. My mom is a nurse and rushed in and started CPR. I called 911. It was the longest 5 minutes of my life. In that time, I gave the phone to my fiancé and called my siblings. He was rushed to the hospital into the ER then rushed to a cardiac unit about 35 mins away. I remember driving to the hospital 35 mins away, now about 11pm at night, eyes blurry and head pounding.

Dad suffered cracked ribs thanks to my mom but she saved his life. He ended up having a triple by-pass to clear 1 fully clogged artery and 2 75% clogged arteries. We all laughed that he shouldn't piss mom off again or she would crack more ribs. He made a full recovery but was off work for several months.

Fast Forward February 22, 2019 - My mom and dad had just gotten back from a trip to Costa Rica over valentines day. This was their 2nd or 3rd trip there and they loved it. I got a text from my mom during the day and it said ""Emergency family meeting. be here at 7pm."". I immediately called my dad and said ""what is mom talking about. Not cool to cause panic like that"" I was pissed. My dad was always non-chalant. He said ""I don't know what she is doing that for. Don't worry everything is okay."" That is the first time in my adult life that I think my dad lied to me.

We all arrive at mom and dads and it is tense. No one knows what's going on and my mom says that dad had some tests done before they went away and they got the results earlier but didn't open the letter until they got back. The letter confirmed that dad had Stage 3 Lung Cancer with mets to his bones (shoulder). The house had never been so silent. After the initial shock, my sister started crying and my brother had piped up and started talking about what next, ""how do we fight this thing?"". The response was that we would fight to the very end but it was not looking good. Dad went for a few tests and was eventual prescribed opioids to help with pain. He ended up getting a bowel obstruction due to the constipation caused by opioids and was admitted to the hospital. The last time I saw my dad eat a full meal was just before this happened in the middle of March let's say.

Thursday, May 2nd, 2019 - dad had been doing radiation treatment for a week but they had determined it wasn't slowing down the spread. I got a call from my mom and she said dad was going home. I was confused. ""What about treatment?"". She said ""Dad doesn't want to fight anymore"". I was in shock. My dad was the strongest human being I ever knew. He had a grip like a damn lobster and was mentally strong. I texted my dad and said I love you.

We lost my dad to Cancer on May 8th, 2019. He was in a hospice from May 5th - May 8th. It was wonderful. On May 7th, my Fiancé and I were trying to arrange an officiant to marry us while dad was still with us. I went home around 11pm on May 7th and only my mom and Fiancé stayed. Dad had started getting sleep apnea and struggled through the night. I got a call around 4:30am from my Fiancé and said you should come see your dad. As I walked in the room greeting my dad, the nurse was saying ""I'm so sorry Russ"". I missed seeing him by a mere 25 seconds. We were all crushed.

While we were writing the obituary, Dustin chimed in that he wanted to include that he wasn't his real son. I was shocked. This is the first time since I was 13/14 that I had heard that. Dustin did end up telling Sal a year back so it wasn't such a shock to him. My mom didn't know Sal or I knew but she went with it and didn't skip a beat. We included how my dad met my mom and 1 year old Dustin and never looked back. He cared for Dustin as if he were his own, because he was his son. I think back and I know now, Dustin had acted out as a teenager/young adult because of this fact. To this day, my dad is his hero, for more ways than you can think. Not only did he save Dustin from his junkie father but he took in my mom and Dustin with open arms. My dad never found out that Sal or I knew, but I wish he had so I could have told him that there was no need for secrecy.

That summer we brought his ashes to Cape Breton and laid him to rest with my Mamere and Papere. It was sort of surreal. By this point, we had already begun the healing process and having a funeral a few months after ripped the wound open and it stung. Dustin read his obituary. I was standing right beside him and I could tell it gave him comfort. As he would choke up, I told him to ""relax, you got this"". He continued and finished. I was proud.

You're probably wondering why I went into so much detail about my dad. My dad was the center of all of our world, we just didn't know it. He held the family together like glue. Since he has been gone, that glue has dried and cracked and our family has sort of come undone but that is for another story.

Dustin had already had a drug problem way longer than my dad getting sick. I once asked him how many Percocet's he takes a day and he said to me ""I take them like they are tic-tacs. 40 - 50 a day? I don't know.""

Dustin is a crane operator and makes top dollar for his work. He often goes on dry spells and won't work for a month or so but then a shut down for a industrial plant would happen and he would be working 10 - 16 hour days and making double time after 8 hours. He made good money. Once dad passed away, Dustin took some time off of work and ever since, he has worked maybe 2 months. He is faced with financial instability, a troubled relationship, 3 kids, mountains of debt, no support system at home and poor choices to turn to drugs.

Finally a break. Dustin got called for a shut down and was making $6k a week including his accommodations (he was only home on Sundays). My birthday had just passed and we were getting together as a family on Sunday as Dustin would be home. I called him on the Friday and asked if I could go get a tool from his house. He said he was home. Odd. I knew he was working and knew he wouldn't be home till Sunday. I went over and he was visibly distraught. He said he left a bit early on Thursday night as he had a headache and it was too windy to fly the cranes so they were grounded. He got a call on Friday morning which instructed him to leave site and go home. He was kicked off of site as a lady had filed a complaint on Dustin for harassment. This was not Dustin. He would 100% make a crude joke from time to time, but he wasn't stupid. He hadn't told anyone, and still hasn't told anyone the truth. Everyone thinks they just didn't have any more work. He met with his employer on the following Tuesday. They advised that he was suspended without pay and that they had to conduct a formal review that ""could take a while"". He had two options, go on the list and wait for another company to offer him work, or sit at home until they do their review. See my brother is a bit bullheaded and feels that he has been wronged. He felt that his company had already made up their mind regardless of hearing his side of the story. He left the company and has been sitting on the list ever since.

It has been two weeks and his mental stability has been deteriorating. He is in a bad place. I look on the past year and I knew he was using because he was skinny, he had major mood swings and his eyes were always dilated.

My mom called me yesterday and said that I was the only one who he felt he could talk to and now I feel that I am my brothers keeper. His life is in my hands and I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. I will not give up. I will do everything in my power to help him. He knows he has a problem and I'd say that's a good start I just need to get him to commit to getting help. He drives high and is going to get himself killed whether it be a car accident or an overdose.

I can't help but feel that I have let him down as a brother. I should have acted much before it got to this point and I am angry at myself for my negligence. He told my mom that we would all be better off without him and he hates himself. This was the realization to me that I need to act and I need to act fast. I have tried reaching out to him but he knows what I want to talk about and am worried he is going to start avoiding me more so than he is now.

I hope there is someone on here that has experienced helping someone with trauma recover from opioid addiction. Any advise would be much appreciated.

Thanks for reading.",8

My mom has been battling severe alcohol addiction for at least 20 years or so (that I know of) and it's gotten to the point where she is about to drink herself to death.

For example - she just did a 7 week stint in rehab and immediately got blackout drunk the moment she got back to her hometown. She's been in rehab at least half a dozen times.

She's aware she can't go on living like this... in fact, she is the one who even found her most recent treatment center (even though she doesn't remember it). Unfortunately I think through a combination of damaged mental reward pathways combined with years of abusing her body and malnutrition, she in incapable of staying sober on her own.

It's only a matter of time before she stops breathing for the final time or falls and cracks her head. My family is ready to have her committed but to me that sounds like the most horrible end for her.

So, I know that nobody can stop if they don't want to stop, but I feel like she would be very receptive to an alternative like Ibogaine or Ayahuasca. At this point even given some level of psychological or physical risk, the alternatives are pretty bleak.

Anyone thoughts on trying something radical like Ibogaine or Ayahuasca with her?",2

Substance abuse has made me realize how much crap is out there and how important it is to take care of ourselves.

This isn't really a post looking for advice or anything. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I feel weird talking about it with friends and family, especially about the porn. I feel depressed as shit but I know it's expected with withdrawal symptoms. I've been playing a lot of video games which could be turning into an addiction itself to help escape eveything else (ironically).

Hi everyone. Hope all is goin well. If you are looking for gifts for loved ones who have ADDICTION problems ....it can be challenging . I my self have addiction problems so I know how certain situations work. The stress , worry , lies that our loved ones could bring if You get a certain gift for them!?!?!? Those feelings are completely natural. When I was using drugs and drinking my FAMILY would sometimes give me cash or gifts. That was their choice. They wanted to just celebrate the holidays. That , a lot of times was the wrong decision yet , in time as I got better the trust began to build . But if you aren’t that giving because of the ACTIVITY of your loved one ( using )  is at a all time high .... there are a few options. FIRST , gifts for their house.... air freshener , candles , pictures for walls , pillows or blankets etc. Those are just a few things for the house and those they could benefit from and could be difficult to re-sell for money. A great gift to help your loved ones out with are taking them to a nice restaurant. It can or may not be expensive but at least you know where the cash is going! Another great gift is to buy them some groceries! Everybody needs to eat and I know from the past .... when I was using , I always had a empty fridge. I never miss those days. Still a GREAT gift. There are GIFT cards online too that puts a block on purchasing ALCOHOL. Look on google , you’ll find plenty options. Then, the last option is... take them to the stores yourself and buy them gifts that the gift giver has control over. Keep the receipt. Never give the receipt to the potential addict / recovering addict. Always keep in mind if they ask for a over priced gift that  it really might not be for them. They could be asking for a person who might want the gift just so they can get rid of it for cash quickly. It’s very tricky. Just be strong . Addiction is hard for a loved one to deal with that kind of sickness. YOU can do it. Be STRONG but love your loved ones as well.",7

It didn’t turn super serious until this year, when someone new started at my job who will offer me a literal handful of 20mg adderall for free from his script every month. I also have several close friends who are prescribed adderall and/or vyvanse. It seems to always be around me. 

It has taken me this long to even recognize that there’s a problem here because it never felt like a problem on days I used. In most ways I felt like it was improving my life. Id get daunting tasks done efficiently, I was a rockstar at work, and I became extremely social and friendly, and had an easier time connecting with others — which has always been hard for me.

Part of me says “it’s not a problem, plenty of people take high mg of prescribed adderall every day, and aren’t dead or in rehab. They’re not addicts.”

I also sense this is my addict brain rationalizing because I know deep down I am too scared to let go of adderall for good. I have kept my problem a secret for months because I can still get more pills if others don’t know. I am honestly afraid to lose access to it because of how much I rely on it.

This way of thinking feels so toxic though, and uncharacteristic of my very logical & rational way of problem-solving. The substance and it’s effects are controlling my real-time decision-making and it’s terrifying to notice. It’s not the real me making these decisions. Adderall brain makes decisions for me now. 

I have told myself it’s the last time dozens of times, only to find myself saying yes to my coworker’s offer a week later. I have never been able to say no, and I feel like a failure every time I find myself in the middle of an intense depressive episode post adderall-binge.

I could just really use some encouraging words or advice from anyone who is more experienced in the recovery program. Apart from tagging along to AA meetings with my ex 5 years ago, I have had no prior substance abuse treatment exposure, and because I have not opened up to anyone about this, I feel lost and a little hopeless about what steps to take. I just don’t know where or how to start this process of recovery for myself.",2

Including my own life. Lost so much money, my freedom because of shoplifting, almost lost my wife and kids. Lost the respect they had for me, my teeth and self respect. I don't know how the monster got me. 
Short back story, I had toured with some famous bands doing audio. I hurt my back pretty bad trying to further my career. Went in for the first of 3 back surgeries and came out with a lifetime supply of pain meds and a spine that would never let me live a normal pain free life.
The doctors always told me I would always be taking pain medication. Well 1 pill started to not work, so it went to 2 then 3 and so on. Changed the meds, upped the strength. Always asked the Dr if I was becoming addicted. I knew I was, but they always said No! I may be physically addicted but not mentally.
Well 2 years later and I am buying H on the streets and trading my pain meds for crack. 5 years later and we have no money because I kept stealing it and lose our house, then the next house is lost.
My wife gets full credit for protecting the kids during all this and knowing it was the drugs and not me doing this. She moved us to a new city to get me away, and yet I still found what I needed.
Finally one day I had enough. I got enough smack and methadone pills and crack and sleeping pills to do me in.
I still remember that day running away from the house, doing it all, and worst part is I remember falling! I was dead, I knew I was dying. I remember the out of body experience of falling face first onto the cement at some random bus stop. And then I don't remember anything, until I woke up in the hospital. 
Someone saw it happen, someone saved me! Someone cared enough to call 911 and saved my life. Narcan, and stomach pump. I woke up few hours later in ER alive. 
I was offered help that day, but it didn't take. I abused suboxone for the next few months. 
Then 1 day I had enough. Took the last 1 and haven't looked back.
What finally helped? Weening down, not being scared if withdrawal. Going to jail 3 months after I quit. If I didn't go in clean and sober, I would have used again during that time. That saved me. It cleared my head. I didn't find religion, I was already religious but those around me finally understood what I was doing and showed me love and compassion. 
It took 2 years for my stomach and digestive track to work correctly. Mentally it took me 1.5 years to not have the cravings.
I give full credit to my wife for saving me and some random stranger for calling 911. My wife is a tough woman.
3 years later and I have one of the best relationships a father can have with his kids. I live in an amazing home again. We moved to Florida to be close to Disney and act like kids again. I have a great job, but not in audio anymore. I am in pain daily, but try to use mental power, relaxing and healthy ways to deal with it. The pain is not as bad as it was when I was on Pain meds!
I have a record that can be expunged in a few years, but I am respected by my peers again.

I am proof that you can dig out of the worst addictions and have a great life without looking back.

Just needed to share, I felt blessed today. I wanted to share with others who may need to know you can survive the Withdrawal. Don't do it alone, let others know and do not lie to yourself anymore.

EDIT: Thank you all! The Gold, the support. Every once in a while I gotta remind myself to keep going and know others can survive also.",174

Anyways grounding is a technique I learned in counseling that really helped me fight off drug cravings/triggers that would normally cause me to use. This takes time, practice and you have to put effort into this for any of this to be effective. Don't think just using any of these methods one time is going to instantly change your life, I don't know maybe for some people the first time it will truly help them. However, for me I had to practice it a lot, this can also be used for anger/self harm/sadness basically any negative emotion or action that you know in the end is wrong and don't want to do but usually can't help it once the thought gets in your head. I'm still thinking about making a discord since not a lot of people said whether or not that's something they are interested in, but this is something that made my path to getting and staying clean a lot easier. It's something I still practice to this day mainly because my problem isn't drug addiction anymore, my problem now is coping with the loss of my soulmate. Do yes this did work when it came to addiction, but truthfully I haven't had much success when it comes to taking my mind off of how much i miss the love of my life.

So I'm wondering if anyone has any words for my situation.

I started dating a guy in June, and I knew that he had previously struggled with a crack addiction. He told me that he had that under control and had for years at this point. I listened without judgment and I asked questions about other drug use and anything else I didn't understand or was ignorant to because I've never done anything like that. I let him know that if he ever felt like he was struggling he could absolutely tell me so we could deal with it together and he wouldn't feel like he was all alone. About 2 months ago, his mother hinted that he had done something I should ask him about. So I confronted him, and he was honest with me. He told me he had ingested meth by eating it right when we got together and he promised he wouldn't do it again. I knew he had tried it before but it wasn't something he particularly enjoyed so I wasn't overly concerned. Fast forward to yesterday... me being snoopy and knowing something was going on because his time was always limited to be with me and other strange occurrences ... I did the typical stupid girlfriend thing. I searched his phone. And this is where I hit the roof. He's been taking meth since the end of September, his friend that I asked him to keep his distance from (because I knew this person needed treatment and was dealing with their own severe addiction) has been giving him drugs and he has been hanging around this person without my knowledge even though I asked him if he had heard from him 2 days ago. I blew a gasket, I felt so betrayed. He didn't argue anything, he just begged me to give him a chance to fix it. He admitted what he's done and of course he swears he will stop and has wanted to stop or tell me for months. I set my hard limits though. I ended the relationship because I cannot be with someone who isn't caring for themselves, taking poisons to hurt themselves, and I have a 5 year old who never needs to see these things up close and personal. I made the condition that I would support his recovery but he had to tell his sister (who also has children) because she is frequently over with his nephews and niece for visits, and he did. After I completely exploded in anger, I did talk to him about it.. asked my questions.. made sure I wasn't missing anything else. I have even found a local community resource that offers payment plans for people without insurance who need help with detox. I have found local NA groups, and online NA groups. But I realize this is all up to him, and I can't force recovery if he doesn't want it. Have I done all I can do now? Am I doing this right? I have a boat load of experience with alcoholics, as my father was one before he passed away... but I don't know anything about drug use.

“Things haven’t been all roses but they are certainly not comparable to the way they were. God has blessed me with a vivid memory of my pain, which has helped me ... when the thought of escaping popped into my head.”

2020-11-08 18:27:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jqm44v/despairredemption_looooong_post/,Despair/Redemption (looooong post),"I would fantasize about running a hose from the tailpipe of my car into a crack in the window. I’d do it while I was high, high enough to not fully contemplate the ramifications, and then I’d go to sleep.

I’d think about the spiders in the walls, hidden behind a single inch of drywall, think about them crawling over the wiring and getting into the pipes and infecting the water.

I'd wonder: if I tried hard enough, could I flip these little gelatinous orbs in my eye sockets around and finally get a look at myself -  the grey, writhing cause of my suffering?

I’d strip my body down to its barest essentials and ruminate on it and the deranged truths I’d discovered, endlessly. I’d think: I am a mouth and a stomach and a brain, and my purpose is to convert enough food into energy that I might reproduce and maybe, if I’m lucky, make some money along the way. I’d think: I’m piloted by little bits of DNA that care nothing for me; I am within a society that cares for nothing but my labor - so why should I care for myself? For anything?

I’d look in the mirror and stare at my teeth, my gums, my face - I was utterly disgusted by the fact of my body, my existence. I would become delirious with jealousy when thinking about all those lucky people out there who had never stumbled upon these bare, base, brute facts of existence. How could you go to work when we’re all going to die? How could you look someone in the eyes and find the room in your heart to love them when they’re going to die, too? How could you enjoy the world - creeks and trees and rivers and dogs and people, the sound of laughter and nostalgic memories and hope for the future - how can you enjoy these things when their ultimate destiny is oblivion? What else was there to do but despair at all that never was and all that could have been? How could you not endlessly wish that this fallen world had been designed by a more just god, or a more lucky bit of happenstance?

How could I not feel like I was drowning when looking at the clouds and recalling that - when I was younger - I used to know in my heart that every one of them contained an angel?

How could I not decide that the only answer was to erase myself from the world, to be so brutal to my body and to my mind so as to repudiate the very concept of existence? I knew the truth: that every first kiss and every heartbreak, every first breath and every doting mother, every hero and every villain - that the sum of human existence, its every moment of beauty and its every moment of pain - I knew these things all amounted to nothing. I’d think about looking at the earth from space and seeing it suspended in a sunbeam, looking so utterly insignificant that you could miss it if you didn’t know where to look, and I’d think: there. That’s it. That's everything there is; we're nothing but a speck of dust.

The thing about dope is that it doesn't make you happy. It makes the despair worse. It confirms your every worst intuition. It narrows you, shrinks you. It turns your world into a myopic little slice of hell. There are no mountains to climb, no memories to make, no great loves to be had, no meaning to be found. There is, simply, dope. That’s it. That’s all. Because why waste time searching for meaning when there is none, and when the grating euphoria of the masses feels so plastic and fake, and when you've found something that makes you feel better? Am I supposed to find meaning in the sublime nature of a new set of window blinds? Am I supposed to dedicate my being to a society that, while it certainly has its value, is actively destroying the world and alienating its every member? Am I supposed to get really into paleo? The corporate ladder? Should I order themed boxes? What about all those Marvel movies? Will those fill the void? Are these things the answers to my problems?

They weren’t then, and they aren’t now. The difference was that back then I decided the answer to this feeling of total alienation was to further alienate myself, to retreat into a world of numb, dead-eyed ecstasy. I would use mostly because by that point I couldn’t control myself, but also because I imagined it was the perfect answer to the existential situation as I saw it. This, everything there is, is really nothing - I knew this to be true - I knew there was not one iota of meaning to be found, so why shouldn’t I feel good for a bit before the coming inevitably of not just my death, but the complete and total erasure of the entire universe? Even the concept of death would cease to have meaning in the end. There would be nothing and no one, and if that was the future, didn’t it reach back into the present and poison it with its hateful, engulfing nothingness? In fact, even the world nothingness feels inadequate for what awaits us. There are no words for it but oblivion, but even applying a word to it feels dishonest. It is something that can't be named or even truly contemplated. To call it hateful doesn’t even make any sense. Oblivion doesn’t hate, it just engulfs and extinguishes. It simply is, and if it will be, isn't it also all that ever was? It is as complete and total a repudiation of the entire concept of existence as there can be, let alone of the comparatively tiny thing that is a single life. So what did it matter if I turned every moment of my life into a simulation of hell if there were still daily moments of bliss, when nothing mattered anyway? 

And so, perversely, the crushing weight, the narrowing of my being, was part of the appeal. Addiction is the opposite of life, of thinking. You will still despair (oh god, will you despair) but it slowly morphs the ache into something more mundane, it makes the pain immediate instead of abstract: What is happening to my body, to my mind? Why does this hurt so much? Why can’t I stop? And then, once you get your hands on some, yet again, you remember: it feels so good mainly because it allows you to forget about everything else. That’s why you do it. Even, maybe especially when you're sick, you find that there isn't much room for anything else in your mind. You don’t have to worry much about finding meaning elsewhere if you can simply flood your brain with chemicals and therefore create an overpowering simulation of happiness and satisfaction - and wasn't that what happiness was, anyway? A mere simulation? 

So, here's what I did: I reveled in it even as I hated every second of it. I didn’t have to know anything anymore. I didn’t have to care. I didn’t have to feel that constant pit in my stomach, the simultaneous, overwhelming desire for meaning and connection coupled with the suspicion that these things didn’t exist, or that if they did, they simply weren’t available to me. I could lean in to the nature of existence as I then saw it - a pure illusion, lacking anything to hold on to, lacking anything to serve as a buffer against the headwinds of life - and if there was indeed nothing there, did it really matter if I got my kicks from a drug as opposed to a new car, or a good conversation, or a friend, or anything else?

These feelings flowed downward too. If existence itself was a farce, then did everyday life stand a chance? I had decided that since life in modern society was just an elaborate hedonic treadmill (or, as I'd have it, hedonic chutes and ladders), that I was therefore simply embodying this logic and taking it towards its natural endpoint. I would think: here’s how we are taught to find happiness. Do this, then do it again. Get that job, then want a better one. Buy something, then buy something again. Always be trying to sate a hunger that never quite seems to go away. Sure, maybe that new TV, nice car, your diploma - and the likes you got when you posted them - made you feel nice for a bit, and maybe accomplishing that societally induced, capital increasing goal would quiet your mind for a moment, but it would always end the same: you would need more, more, and more again.

So, wasn’t I simply distilling this logic to its essence and working it at warp speed? That’s what I would tell myself, anyway. Look upon the alienating effects of society made flesh, peasants! I’ve cracked the code! You waste your time chasing meaning in inherently meaningless things, while I have discovered there is no meaning to be found, and am simply taking a shortcut to those same fleeting, brain-mush induced moments of quickly dissipating satisfaction - here now; gone again.

—————————————————————————————

To call this logic slightly absurd and wholly self defeating is an understatement. Granted, there is no lasting meaning to be found at Disney World, or in the rat race, or in finally getting that nice new car. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be found anywhere. And it doesn’t mean that the best response to an insane, alienating society is to go insane yourself. Understandable, perhaps, but also soul destroying. To allow the toxic messages found in our society to infect my very being, to imagine I was engaging in some sort of principled protest: slow-motion-ecstatic-suicide as performance art - was not just ill advised - it made it all but certain I would never find the meaning and connection I desperately wanted.

It took me a while to realize this. Even after getting sober, it was hard to believe that I’d done anything more than prolong my inevitable descent into the abyss. I was still stuck in a world that seemed to have mostly decided on a way of doing things that felt utterly pointless to me - an illusory realm whose outward appearance of unlimited abundance and slick, gleaming perfection were so overpowering only because the depth of society’s hollowness required a pretty, distracting mask to hide behind. And my overall feelings about the modern world mostly haven’t changed. There is a lot of good to be found here, but there’s a whole lot of bad too. 

But that doesn’t mean that meaning can’t be made to bloom from despair. 

Because, as I found out, it certainly can. It is hard; it certainly isn’t easy. But, for me at least, what it required  was transforming utter terror into awe and appreciation. In fact, I feel it is all the more meaningful to recognize our precarious position, our broken and imperfect and miraculous and magical and deeply, truly *human* nature - as beings who are so wonderful that we can find meaning in shooting stars, or bird calls, or the smell of rain, or a sunset - that even though we know that shooting stars are just bits of debris burning through the atmosphere, that the birds don’t actually sing for us, and that the smell of rain and the breathtaking beauty of a sunset are simply intricate mental illusions -  that even though we know these things, we are still lucky enough to be endowed with minds that can find beauty in them regardless of their “true” nature, and that all this, every single bit of good that exists in the universe, has managed to stake a place for itself on that little mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam, with us - and isn't that just amazing? And most importantly, we are able to share this strange and wonderful experience with other people. We can say: “hey, look at all this crazy stuff I’ve got here in my head!” and then, crucially: “let me see what you have in yours.” That is where meaning can be found - in finding ways to share the profound beauty, the sublimity, and yes, sometimes the terror of our existence with others - and for others to share their experiences with you, and to appreciate them for what they are, in all their strange, incomprehensible beauty, instead of for what you wish them to be. 

I don’t mean experiences in the mundane sense, as in a rote recounting of your day, or your feelings about the latest royal wedding. I hate small talk, but let’s talk about the weather. About how we can look up at the sky during a thunderstorm, see the strange magic of clouds and thunder and darkness and lightning, and we know that we are simply watching the results of certain physical realities as interpreted by our brain, and yet there’s still *something* there, isn’t there? Let’s talk about the way the way a certain smell - the smell of rain, or runny sunscreen, or decaying leaves - can transport you immediately into the past, and even though you know it’s simply the result of chemical receptors in your nose activating your olfactory neurons, you find that this fact doesn’t matter, does it? You’re *there* - ten years ago, or fifteen or twenty or fifty, and it ceases to matter exactly why this is happening, just that it is. Let’s also talk about how that if we’re cursed with the knowledge of our own mortality - with the ability to think things that no other creatures can - then we are also blessed with it. It makes things truly matter, even if at a terrible cost. It makes the end of a life seem like the worst, most heartbreaking thing that could ever happen, but it also makes the many small moments that make a life that much more meaningful, and it makes us understand that even if the bad moments outweighed the good, there was still some good, some beauty, and some truth, and that’s so much better than nothing at all.

—————————————————————————————

There are many ways I could frame what led me to addiction. Was it that I was self medicating a distressing slip into mental illness? Was is that I was grieving my dad’s death, and more importantly, grieving the life he led and the childhood I felt he had ruined? Is addiction a natural result, for a certain proportion of people, of dysfunctional family dynamics?

Or was it something a bit deeper? I desperately wanted, and still do want, to find meaning, and more importantly, connection with others. But finding meaning sometimes feels like a fool’s errand nowadays - the more traditional ways simply do not work for me, and the new ways (pop culture and consumerism and all the blind, frenzied consumption these things entail; wealth; status; a nice house, five cars; etc) sometimes feel like attempts at mocking the idea of meaning itself. And connection - sure, it’s still technically possible, but such a thing becomes much harder when you suffer from a pathological lack of self worth and a menagerie of mental illnesses whose number and variety would be hilarious if it wasn’t so tragic.

So, meaning proving elusive in a mechanistic universe that is equal parts terrifying and sublimely, achingly beautiful, and human connection being out of reach, maybe I chose to connect with something that would never let me down, even if it killed me.

This is a slightly self serving explanation, in that it dilutes the charge that I was simply being a hedonistic maniac - that I had more noble reasons for doing what I did. I would be lying if I said it didn’t feel good, that it wasn’t occasionally fun, and that I wasn’t sometimes an insufferable idiot. I wasn’t the dopehead philosopher or anything. A lot of things contributed to what ultimately became a nearly fatal mental illness, and I can’t rule out youthful indiscretion and pure, simple, boneheaded stupidity as factors in their own right. But it wouldn’t be true to say that I simply didn’t care, or that I was just too myopic to see the self defeating nature of what I was doing. I cared, deeply. So much that it hurt. And I don’t think it would be a stretch to apply this insight to anyone else suffering from an addiction or a mental illness until proven otherwise. You would not have been able to tell from my behavior that these things were in my head. I looked, acted, and talked like someone who had decided to give up on the world (though I had, at that time), and someone who had decided that their needs and desires trumped those of anyone else’s (I had not, but I *literally* could not control myself).

So what is the solution to the predicament as I see it? It is easy to give into despair. There is so much pain in the world - it’s everywhere you look. And that’s without even getting into the existential shit-show that is humanity’s place in the universe. But I think the only way to have a chance at a meaningful life that matters requires you to look these truths in the face, to not slink away into a narcotic wonderland or into denial, and to say, so what? We are all, ultimately, a flash in the pan, a speck floating through a void, but this fact doesn’t make it any less good and meaningful to try to connect with other people and help them - to stand together with everyone else stuck in the muck and say: fuck it. We’re here, together, which is so much better than being here alone. We’re gonna be happy anyway.",12
2020-11-08 18:23:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jqm1lg/stigma/,Stigma,"A long 
A long time ago, in the dark ages that were the mid 20th century, people had strange ideas about the causes of cancer. Sure, there was something physically wrong with the body, but how did the problem start? Did it just come out of nowhere? Or did the victims themselves deserve some of the blame? 

This strain of thought birthed the idea that those with certain personality traits might be more prone to developing cancer. It was known that being neurotic or introverted would increase your chance of getting it in the first place, and then these traits, along with a lack of willpower and a predisposition toward depression, would ensure that you wouldn’t survive it. There were studies in respected journals, and medical advice was dispensed with these newfound truths in mind. Cancer was a weak person’s affliction - the victim would invite it in by being anxious or depressed, and they would prove their mental fortitude, or lack thereof, by surviving it, or not. 

Obviously, this is insane. Whether or not you have neurotic tendencies has absolutely no predictive power over whether or not you might get cancer. It didn’t make sense at the time, and in hindsight it is utterly horrifying that we used to essentially blame cancer victims for their own  suffering. Now, we (correctly) treat them as blameless victims deserving of compassion and care, and we call them survivors when they beat it. The same goes for any number of ailments that were previously used as a pretext to demean the personal character of their victims at best, or to basically bar them from society at worst.

The problem is that while we have made progress on this front, we still have much the same attitude towards sufferers of mental illness. Depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and especially addiction - we collectively gesture toward a better future with exhortations to end the stigma and find some understanding, but there’s a long way to go. People suffering with these issues are made to feel that they are at complete fault - the depressed person just doesn’t have the right attitude, the addict is possessed of an intractable character flaw. And even worse - it is extremely hard to talk about these things. #Endthestigma doesn’t change the fact that there is in fact a brutal societal stigma around having a mental disorder, and worse yet, talking about it. 

A certain section of our society’s collective compassion is reserved for those who have been stricken with a terrible disease and beaten it. And that is absolutely how it should be. My only suggestion is that we open the doors a bit wider to allow more people in. No sufferer of mental illness should feel terrified to share their story - to say that something bad happened to them, or is happening to them - but that it doesn’t define them, that they will beat it. Why should someone struggling with depression be made to feel ashamed at the fact that he didn’t leave his room for 6 months? Isn’t the depression already bad enough? Why should I feel ashamed that I fell victim to a disease that almost killed me, and did kill my father? Isn’t the almost dying, the scar on my chest, enough? Instead of keeping quiet, simply because society hasn’t yet caught up to the science of mental illness, we should be able to find power in our stories, in the same way that survivors of more “traditional,” more palatable diseases do. I hope that by posting this and things like it, I am helping to make that world a tiny bit more likely.",3

I did start drinking heavily with xanax because I was in a bad shape emotionaly since my boyfriend left me. I used to be addicted to xanax in the past but then I quit with the help of my shrink using seroquel and induced sleep. I started again taking xanax in January 2020 responsably for my anxiety but things got out of control one month and half ago when I increased my use especially with heavy drinking daily. Now I am on valium, seroquel and inderal to control the cravings. I can handle xanax but I still feel a urge to drink. How long will it last? I feel anxious altough on the meds and still crave alcohol but less then before. Will I ever be able to drink responsably again? Nobody knows my addiction and I'm faking a flu to avoid friends and social situations because it all involve alcohol. In your opinion did I turn into an alcoholic or I just had a problem with alcohol and stop it early? Thanks and sorry for the long post",3

It might not sound like a lot for some but it’s literally a first for me in about 15 years and I’m proud of myself. I’ve lurked here a lot but never posted...felt this was the right time.

Short-ish version of my story:

-From an awesome supportive white middle class family with both parents and plenty of friends & family

-Drink a little in HS but never did a single “drug” 

-Had a job since 14 y/o, straight A student, prom king, football & basketball team captain

-Turn 18 in ‘04 and moved into my own place

-Get prescribed Tylenol 3’s from the E.R. after getting POISON OAK in 2005

-FALL IN ABSOLUTE LOVE WITH OPIATES 😣

-3’s up to Vics up to Norcs then Dilaudid & Oxy & Morphine and everything else

-Marry my HS sweetheart in ‘06 and move into nicer house, keep doing pills

-Despite my addiction I hold it together and keep it a secret from everyone but a few close friends & my dealer(s)

-Finish University and experience almost a decade of relative happiness

-Daughter is born in ‘13: Happiest but also most stressful time of my life

-Start working more, making a lot more money, taking A LOT more pills, but giving far less attention to the things that really matter

-Fighting with wife a lot mostly about money and me not being there enough

-I think she’s just whining.. “I work too hard for this shit”! I do not take it seriously....

-Wife starts affair with brother in law in ‘15

-They run off together

-I do not take it well

-I move into a friend’s house and proceed to go completely off the rails, drinking a bottle of bourbon and eating/insufflating dozens of pills every single day for a little over 3 years

-Pretty much blacked out/forgot 3-4 years of my life and my daughter’s life

-In 2018 my daughter starts school and I meet a wonderful woman at work, so I decide to go to therapy and see a doctor so I can be better for myself and be the Dad/Partner I should be for them

-Take Suboxone strips starting November 2018 (with a few pill relapses)

-Summer 2020 I get 50% custody of my daughter and we move in with that wonderful woman & her sweet daughter

-November 1, 2020: I take my last strip God willing

TLDR: Regular middle class white kid from California with promising future wrecks his life and sabotages a 14+ year marriage/relationship because of opiates, finally gets his shit together and tapers off Suboxone so he is now 1 week sober for literally the first time since the Spring of 2005.

Thank you so much to everyone on this Sub. You have no idea how much you’ve helped me get this far. I felt HORRIBLE this whole last week withdrawing from Subs but today I woke up feeling happy and clear headed.

When I was doing inpatient at the hospital then the residential treatment center/therapeutic boarding school, there was a lot of group therapy. I got home back in late June, and since then, I've been mostly alone. Online school keeps me pretty isolated. My life feels a bit directionless. The only two things that keep me busy are school and going to the stables to ride my horse Summer. I feel like group therapy might help me connect to people more and keep me motivated to stay clean.

I recently got into smoking low-moderate doses of dmt and taking low doses lsd which has largely been helpful with the psychological problems I face which  I won't go into right now. Seeing as these drugs do not act on dopamine they are largely viewed as non-addictive.

Right so me being me I ended up pushing it somewhat sort of because I got over excited that a drug was helping me with zero consequences. And of course the psychs were like nope u don't do that shit and I had a negative reaction. I then smoked it again because I was like fuck this I'm not letting my brain get the better of me and this time it was fun again (thank God). 

It's clearly not worth risking my mental health so I've stopped. I want to develop a normal healthy relationship with drugs will I ever be able to be ""normal"" or am I an addict  for life, someone who simply can't use drugs ever or I'll end up back to square one every time.

Interestingly I don't seem to have any problem with alcohol, I basicaly never get drunk because I know it makes me impulsive and I average about 4 units a week. .

The other day he was in my room and he randomly said to me out of nowhere he needs to go “look for snacks” in his bedroom (i live in student dorms and he’s a few floors above me) even though there was food sitting right next to us. I know this might sound like a bizarre example but it just seemed so sus. He came back about 10 minutes later saying he “couldn’t find any” but he was all sweaty out of nowhere and really hyper. He kinda started to ramble about nothing and when i gave him a hug he was all twitchy? This excessive sweating and twitching has happened out of nowhere a few times now when i havent seen him in a while, he keeps on making excuses out of nowhere that he needs to go talk to his friend or grab some clothes from his room, but i feel like its just to go do something shady. 

My last relationship ended badly as i found out my ex was also abusing drugs so i’ve explained this to my current bf and he’s reassured me he’s not doing anything but there just seems to be so many strange things going on w him. Pls can someone tell me if what i’m saying just sounds overtly paranoid? or do u think something shady is happening here too? Im terrified this is turning into the same events as my last relationship. 

please does anyone have any advice? I think i might just break if another person i love turns out to be abusing drugs",3

We would party and drink together as adults, ect. I started getting into drugs in about 2011, and slipping further and further away from him. Until about 2016, he kept rescuing me. Rehab after rehab, sleeping in his truck, with a gun outside whatever motel I was in that night, without my knowledge. I know he has every right to have resentment toward me. In 2016, we stopped talking. He just couldn't enable me anymore,  and I understood. I got sober from drugs in the end of 2016. I tried contacting him in 2017 with no avail. He wanted nothing to do with me. Once the courts gave me my children back, and he knew for a fact I was sober from drugs, and on the right track, we began speaking again in 2018. We have only seen each other a handful of times since then, but we speak every morning on the phone. (He moved in 2016, 4 hours away, to stop himself from enabling me). However, I have noticed, although he says he forgives me, I'm always the one to call him. He seems annoyed every time I do. So for the past, almost 3 years, I've tested it. Sometimes I'll go a week without calling. He finally calls me first, and will say, ""well I havent heard from you in a few days...""  but he EXPECTS me to call him first. I accept and dont deny any of my wrong doing. But I've been sober for over 4 years now. I feel like it's time to move on. And I feel like the fact that he NEVER calls me first, it really hurts my feelings. Like I'm not enough. I almost feel like he wants me to need him. Idk. I have no one else to talk about this to that would understand. So here I am.",3

Ive had cocaine and fentantly issues in the past, and those were ontop of smoking weed and heavily drinking, those 2 I still am, but am working on.

Ive had occasions where id be on lots of weed+alcohol+cocaine+ketamine or MDMA all at once, and I remember one night where I went insane and had about 6g of cocaine if not more and did about 5-6g of speed all at once aswell.. it actually got to a point where I could no longer understand what the person next to me was saying, and I felt completely brain numb, and when I tried to talk I lost my words within seconds, it was like I went brain dead. Even for a few nnights and weeks after that night I felt different.. and I am really worried and anxious that because of my past of drug abuse and alcohol abuse and that night in particular, that Ive permanently damaged my brain?

At the moment im on espranor treatment which got me off of fentanyl, and im working on cutting down my alcohol but its basically just those 2 and smoking weed when Im not working..which may also be why I feel how I do now.

Its hard to explain, but I feel constnatly anxious.. and lately Ive been in a near panic attack almost all the time, like I literallyfeel like im about to have a heart attack and that I am going to die, the anxiety gets so severe its insane.. and its even beyond anything I used to feel when I did cocaine and was coming down or had too much of that.. its just this whole other level of anixiety and I dont know why. I cant sleep at all lately, and I wake up every 2 hours at night and smoke a cigerrette. I always feel this anxiety and it doesnt seem to have any end. I also think its because im on a high 16mg dose of espranor, and if I dont manage to take it at the exact time every day then It makes me feel really wierd, and even with that just being on such a high level and knowing I need that much so that I dont get what Ive experienced as severe withdrawls.. the whole thing just makes me anxious and stressed... and I know its going to take months to get off of that as ill need to cut down by like 2mg each week or something, and my doctor only want to do that after Ive got off of alcohol, so its like I need these 2 horrible things to live at the moment and I just never feel normal anymore. I feel like im walking a tight rope all day and that I could suddenly go into some kind of horrible withdrawl and I wont even know if its the espranor or the alcohol, and I worry about that all the time. I cant stop worrying and thinking about all of these things and problems all the time..

 I feel with the past use, and the still smoking and drinking and all these things that I could die a very very early death.. even maybe before I even get off of the Espranor or alcohol. Probably also why my anxiety is so high all the time that I think Im going to die

Do you think ive permanetly damaged myself from my past? IS there anyhope to recover?

I haven’t even been active on reddit in general. I would like to let y’all know (if anyone cares, lol) that I’m 35 days clean from heroin and crack/cocaine. I remember, posting on here & just venting about how hard it was to stay clean for even a day or two. Even with being on methadone aka “liquid handcuffs” - I get it. I eventually would like to get off of methadone and I will but for right now, I need to take baby steps & not overwhelm myself. My clean date is October 1st, 2020. I overdosed on September 29th, 2020 for the second time ever in my whole ten years of using.  5 days prior, I had gotten my ass beat by my ex boyfriend of 4 1/2 years for the 6th time. 2nd time this year & we weren’t even technically “dating” or in a relationship during this period of time. I had just gotten home from a CSS (crisis stabilization services) program. I spent 12 days there & met an amazing guy (which wasn’t intended. I was NOT interested in any type of relationship & now we’ve been together for a little over a month 😊 getting treated the way I should & even more than what’s “expected” is weird but I’m getting used to it.) I did manage to muster up the courage to file a restraining order against my ex, thankfully 😅 and after going back n forth with court zoom sessions, I finally got a year extended on the order last week so, that was great. Although, one of my best friends/neighbors has seen him outside around the building (which clearly violates the restraining order but that’s just considered “hearsay” especially, if I didn’t actually see him with my own eyes or my building’s security officers didn’t see him which sucks but it is what it is. One of my good friends got me a knife for my birthday last month so, I have that, pepper spray and Kevin 💖) so, that’s my little update. I missed you all & I hope you guys are doing well with your own recovery. Oh! How could I forget. I’m also 5 months and 3 days clean from self harm. Yayyy ☺️✨excites to see what the future holds. Not excited about my dental work that needs to be done though but that’s a WHOLE other rant lmao. At least, I’m sober, alive and healthy. That’s all that matters. Talk to you guys soon xoxo",6

On 10/31, I took 375mg of  baclofen all at once fasted 4 hours  after my one cup of coffee and I  felt really drunk for an hour, then I  passed out at 2pm. I slept for 18  hrs, but I must have woken up  sometime and pissed the whole bed. My parents were trying to wake up me  up around 8am. When I was waking up,  my face was facing the pillow and  I vomited something that left a green  stain on my pillow. I was  completely confused not about who I was and  where I am, but how I felt.  I could barely respond, really cold and  shaky. Felt in a veggie-state.

They called the ambulance, and they sat me down and left me with an iv of Plasmalyte 500ml.

I   fell asleep again 10am and woke up at 4pm. Man, I could not breathe -   it was so shallow I thought I was slowly dying. Every part of my body   hurt and I pissed myself again without knowing. I had to put on a   goddamn diaper. My mom said at one point she asked me who she was- I   could not recognize her. I just shrugged...

I   normally take Tianeptine 12.5mg 3x a day, 150mg Pregabalin 3x a day,  2mg Kpin 3x a day - every 4 hours. That's my normal, medical routine. I   took that as well that day before all that baclofen.

It's   been 5 days and I assumed I would feel negatively like depressed,   anxiety, fatigue. It seems day by day it's getting better, but the   fatigue is still very persistent and intense. I'm not sure if I caused   acute kidney failure or fucked up my brain. I know it hasn't been a week, but I am just worried.

Would simply really appreciate some feedback.",2

I wanted to stop ruining my life but also didn’t want to stop getting high and drunk. My loved ones wanted me to stop doing the ONE thing that gave me any joy or satisfaction. Nothing seemed enjoyable without a good buzz. 

It wasn’t until my parents completely cut me off, that I took sobriety seriously because I had no other choice (this is after I was homeless sleeping on playgrounds, this is after I told them I hated them, this is after I burned every bridge with every other person in my life). I went back and asked for help. I said I was done. My intentions and actions aligned and now I have 10 years sober from all drugs and alcohol.

That was 3 days ago, those were my last money. I didn't know what to do, I can't tell my parents that I am gambling so I asked my close friend to borrow me some money to buy food etc. He gave me the money and I went home and I was so restless, so I rushed to the ATM and put all the money my friend gave me on my card, I thought that was the only way I wouldn't gamble them. When I got home I suddenly remembered that I have several account on online casinos, I didn't even think twice and gambled all the money again on online casinos,as I was gambling the money I was begging God to somehow make me stop. I really want to stop this, I can't go to gamblers anonymous because there is no such thing in my country. I don't know how to tell my friend that I gambled the money again, that I am left broke again. I am tired of this life, I feel like I am the weakest person ever, I could have so much money, do so much with my life. Gambling has drained me emotionally, mentally, physically... I lost interest in everything, I sleep only 4 hours. I fall asleep at 7am and wake up at 11am tired, I spend the whole day just lying in bed doing nothing, I am behind in my college, all my friends got girlfriends and here I am depressed, feeling like a scum because of this stupid addiction. Even now when I am typing this I know even if I find 10$ somewhere, the first thing that I will probably do is gamble it all, I can't take this anymore. I am only 21 and I feel like my life is over, if I do this now, I can't imagine what it will be like in 10 years, I probably will be dead..

I’m 19 right now but have been in the workforce since I was 16, I left school at 16 and went straight into work. All I wanted in life was pleasure and comfort and I only had my own intentions and feelings in mind. I learnt how to manipulate to gain control and power over other people unconsciously,it would come out in my actions mostly apposed to words. I learned very quickly that bad words and put downs mostly make people bitter and causes them to alienate you, I was pretty indifferent to not only others emotions but also my own. So I adapted and became more discreet with my manipulation, just the right words, right tone and facial expressions to get what I want. I was in covert narcissism to avoid detection and as I am pretty introverted but it didn’t work on the playground. I never saw the point in school while I was there and whilst I was in school I was there physically but I was never present mentally, I was in my own world perfectly constructed by me, my happy place because the real world didn’t make any sense to me and I felt rejected from being bullied about my weight and appearance and a range of other factors, this gave me a feeling of indifferent to others. If you’re not relevant to my life I don’t care about you kind of attitude. Not a healthy outlook by and means. This lead me down the path of anxiety and depression and to cope I started stealing marijuana off my father at 11-16 smoking almost daily only after 2 weeks, and he never even noticed (or so I thought) but after talking to him about it recently he said he knew after a certain point but did not care simply because he had oz’s of the stuff pretty consistently (yeah right you didn’t care, tell that to your passive aggressiveness). After some introspection I’ve come to learn my father is also narcissistic and is probably the reason why I lived with him (parents split right after my birth), I chose to live that life and stay in that environment when I had a mother who had a much happier and healthy living environment and loves me infinitely more. I chose pleasure and comfort over growth, I see that now.

In my lifetime I’ve smoked way too much cigarettes, weed, done downers, uppers, struggled with sexual deviance, addiction to power and status, even your cellphone. All of it is a trap. It takes time and mental resources from you for short term gratification that will only hurt you in the long run.

In the last year I’ve had 3 acid trips and one really bad MDMA(cut with speed and god knows what else) psychosis. My first trip turned out to be one  big psychotic episode with me screaming down the house“too many questions” and throwing shit at walls. long story short my flat mates at the time had to call an ambulance on me cause they’d thought maybe I was on meth and could turn violent towards them. This was at 2 am. Basically I (a beginner to psychedelics) even after doing my research, thought it would be a good idea to throw down two 150ug tabs, pen and paper ask myself some questions about life and existence. Oh and I was also smoking copious amounts of marijuana and vaping some high nic juice so was already out of it before I even started tripping. I ended up being hospitalised where I exposed myself to staff and patients running around “furiously masterbating” just as well the police got called, I got put in a cell overnight then was psychologically evaluated by a councillor few weeks later. Basically just manipulated him and made myself out as a stupid kid who made a stupid mistake, had genuine remorse and would NOT. do it again.

Second trip was a little better (better in the sense i didn’t end up in hospital and jail again) I had a friend to trip with this time. My plan was I got him to drive us very far out of town just in case it happened again, didn’t tell him of course.(what a shitty thing to do, right?) Basically how that trip turned out was me blacking out and preaching about existence and how life is a rat race and we’re all working to just to serve the 1% of the population, blah blah blah crazy nonsense, and then I exposed myself to him and told my friend to suck it and that I was God himself and disobeying my orders would prove devastating to his development in life and it was a sin to disobey god. Just as well he’s not as crazy as me, just a little but not to my extent. He seemed to enjoy his trip overall and just kind of brushed it off I guess and  gave me a bowl to smoke then drove me home when we were off peak. Laughed the whole experience off later and agreed what happens in the trip, stays in the trip.

Now this is where it gets into recent times. First trip was maybe just over a year ago, second 6 months ago and here we have my “MDMA” experience from early September. 
I live away from my hometown and had this guy I knew from high school ask to stay a couple nights cause he couldn’t afford a motel and didn’t want to sleep in his car. I said yes, I thought I was being a good guy but I really just wanted to see what I could get out of him. Little did I know he was also trying to get something out of me. He mentioned some more friends from said hometown were here and were looking to buy some MDMA and asked if I’d go halves on a gram with him. I said yes. They arrive with this stuff at almost 12pm (keep in mind I had work the next day at 8am) didn’t look anything like MDMA to me. It was kind of a dark purple rock, if I had to guess was probably xtc pills re rocked and cut with amphetamine. Thinking in the moment I just said “fuck it, well they’re already here with the shit. May aswell do it now” I had god knows how much of the stuff. I just cut off a big rock, swallowed it and also had 3 big lines. Everyone else only had 1-2 medium lines but my inner feeling for importance took over and I had to take more just to prove I was the perceived “alpha”. I had already been manifesting the idea that I was a full blown corporate psychopath and I could escape the rat race and start making real money if I just applied myself. 
Everyone went out to the lounge and I stayed in my room just thinking. All of a sudden one of the girls runs into my room saying “I don’t think this is normal stuff, this doesn’t feel right” this made me very uneasy as I literally had the most. But I brushed it off to her “we’ll be fine, just think pretty thoughts and the Molly will do the rest” this worked for the meantime, or so I thought. I lost my perception of time and was very very dissociative for the next hour or so. People did come to check on me every so often, give me water and what not and I did appreciate that alot, but my ego had other intentions. Eventually I got to talking with another dude at the party, and he told me we’d all done crack and it was the first dudes idea and he was scheming on me, he got me up and took me to the lounge, I didn’t want anyone to see me in that state in the first place. I played it off but very very grandiosely and just admitted to the room I was the psychopath and that I could see through all of them like a crystal ball, mostly heard this from people after the experience but keep in mind I was disconnected with reality and I don’t actually remember much of the experience after I left my room. This is where is gets really scary. I then proceeded to give him this wide eye look and just ran at him and started choking him with intent to kill. I easily could have ruined my life this night and I’m ever so grateful to be here typing these sentences in a comfortable place and not in a prison cell counting how many ants are running across the floor. The others were able to pull me off him, I punched him in the face a few times first then tried to choke so they had time and numbers in people on their side. I then felt like I was dying and actually did start dying. I was losing conscience and my heart stopped beating and 911 got called. They done CPR on me and I was able to start breathing again and the lady on the phone told everyone what to do before they arrived. Keep in mind almost everyone there was also on the same shit so it was just chaos and eventually the tweakers ran off. I was left with me, my best friend that I live with and 2 of our girl friends. They were just drunk, my best friend is also narcissistic and we’re very honest with each other so he understood what was going on and just had a laugh with me. Unresponsive but I was looking from the 3rd person perspective having a laugh aswell. The ambulance arrived with police, they started ripping the house apart looking for drugs. Probably thought it was a trap house since it was already a mess as I was in the process of moving. Just as well the tweakers all ran off and nobody else snitched. I ended up getting taken to the hospital for a couple more hours then came too in the waiting room, I just walked out, called my friend and got picked up 10 minutes later. I regret looking back not thanking the doctors or anything now, genuinely. This gave me a little more respect for life itself.

My third trip was last weekend and let me tell you. I’m starting to see all of the mistakes I have made in life and the path I’ve taken that lead me here, and that I can escape. This is not the life I wanted at all, I’m a simple man at heart and just want to be happy. I’m now in the process of making some positive change and I see the true nature of where this all comes from. Drugs have dictated my life up until this point, I was numb to my emotions and I cried like a baby on this trip as I was confronted with the consequences of my actions through the lense of pain & suffering. The guy I attacked? He has to live his whole life carrying the weight of that experience. It’s not even his fault either, it’s the drugs, and very likely also triggered by trauma to do the drugs. Me? I slang on the side for the money and the things money can buy. But also it gave me easy access to the drugs and other users I saw as pawns I could exploit, being greedy, being grandiose. Thinking of myself and not thinking that these customers are actually dead inside and I’m selling false hope. The trade off is a damaged mind and a disconnect from reality that this world doesn’t need. I just went deep into the forest with food, water, my phone, and a tab. Set and setting is very important for a trip and if anything this is not only to raise awareness for mental health. But if you’re gonna do drugs, don’t be dumb like me. Listen to your intuition, listen to facts and then fact check then. Seek truth in finding yourself. This is only the start for me and it’s not gonna be easy but I’m gonna pull myself out of this and I have only the people around me to thank, LSD showed me that people do care and look out for me, it’s just that I ignore and suppress it. LSD can only show you the path, but it’s up to you to put in the work and get there. 

Congratulations, you made it to the end of the story, what a shit show huh? It’s okay though, we all make mistakes in life and the first step into making change is self-acceptance. Spread love and good vibes and the universe will pay you back dividends infinity higher in value than anything your pain will bring you. Happiness is a mindset that can be cultivated by first solving where it comes from and submitting to your emotions. Question the negative thoughts and emotions and never be afraid to reach out for help. Submitting yourself to addiction is the path of least resistance and it will feel good short term. But it’s going to come at a cost, if you have any questions feel free to ask. If not, enjoy the rest of your day and stay he",4
2020-11-03 02:20:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jn60ww/the_cycle_never_ends/,The Cycle Never Ends,"I recently got extremely lucky with a job in IT. I’ve always been good with computers and tech in general but somehow I ended up scrubbing toilets in a run down strip mall at 27.

So now 28 I get this AMAZING job with potential to do something I don’t despise for the rest of my life, after being off speed for around 6 months and the first thing I do is go get some. 

I think what really triggered it was feeling totally overwhelmed, really wanting to do well and knowing it would be easy with a couple of pills. 

The problem is they really do work. 

Ok so now we’re a few weeks in and I’m lying here yet again in the depths of a very negative train of thought involving suicide wondering if I’ll ever get out of this cycle.

The one thing I’m really worried about is the amazing woman lying next to me, if I’ll ever be able to give her a family and even if I can, is that such a good idea? 

If I can’t even get through a few days at a new job how will I deal with job + KIDS!? 

So now I’m looking up safes on Amazon and making a list of items I shouldn’t be allowed to have access to at night such as debit cards and keys. This phase is so funny, where I actually have some hope and convince myself history isn’t doomed to repeat itself.

I wish it wasn't me who was writing this.  I really wish it wasn't.  I wish I wasn't handpicked because I have one of the ""best handles"" on this subject.  I wish I wasn't ""qualified"" to speak on the heroin epidemic that is a growing problem nationwide.  I wish I wasn't a member of a community no one really wants to be a part of.  No one ever says to themselves while reading stuff like mine, ""I wish I could relate to this.""

But I am.  I am the non-addict who knows all too well what it's like to have an addict in the family.

I know what it's like to worry yourself sick.  To cry yourself to sleep.  To stare at baby pictures & reminisce.  To check on them while they sleep to make sure they are still breathing.

I know to watch out for pinhole pupils and subtle changes in behavior.  To listen to them talk and make excuses and pile on lie after lie.  I know what it's like to pretend to believe them because you are just too mentally exhausted for an argument when you know they are lying straight to your face.

I know what it's like to be confused all the damn time; to see their potential, to know what they are throwing away.

I know what it's like to want their recovery more than they do.  To be the one doing research on rehabs and other outlets for recovery.

I know what it's like to miss someone who is still standing right in front of you.

I know what it's like to wonder if each unexpected phone call is ""the"" phone call.  I know what it's like to be hurt so bad and be made so sick that part of you wishes you would just get ""the"" phone call if nothing is going to change.  You want that finality.  You need the cycle to end.  I know what it's like to hate yourself for even allowing yourself to find relief in that horrible thought.

I know what it's like to get the worst news of your life, and still walk into the grocery store and run your errands and smile at the cashier.

I know what it's like to become a part-time detective.  To snoop through drawers and texts.  You know you are going to find something, and you look until you do just so you feel less crazy.  So you can say to yourself, ""I am not paranoid.  This is happening again.""

I know what it's like to have your mind clouded; to turn into a functioning zombie.  I know what it's like to be physically present at board meetings and dinner dates, but mentally gone.

I know what it's like to stop caring about your own personal and professional life.  My relationship took a backseat, Christ not even the backseat - I kicked him out of the car.  I would show up to work not showered and with huge bags under my eyes.  I would cry at my desk.

Everything the outside world expected of me seemed frivolous if I couldn't keep one of my most important people in my life out of harm's way.

I know what it's like to be really pissed off.  Like, REALLY pissed the hell off.  Between the sadness there is a lot of anger.  I know what it's like to feel guilty for being so mad, even knowing all you know about addiction.  You are allowed to be angry.  This is not the life you signed up for.

I know what it's like to scour a bookshelf and not find what you are looking for because this illness is still so hard to talk about, let alone right write about.

I know what it's like to hear someone argue that addiction is not an illness, that it is a choice.  I know all too well that feeling of heat rising in your face as they go on and on about something they know nothing about.

I know what it's like to stop becoming angry with these people.  They do not understand.  They are lucky to not understand.  I know what it is like to catch yourself wishing that you didn't understand either.

I know the difference between enabling and empowering.  I know there is a fine line between the two and the difference can mean life or death.  I know what it's like to the feel the weight of each day on your shoulders trying to balance the two.

I have been through enough to know that things don't just change for the worse overnight; they can change in a millisecond.  In a blink of an eye.  As quick as it takes two people to make a $10 exchange.

I know what it's like to feel stigmatized.  To be the ""sister of a drug addict,"" a ""friend of a drug addict,"" ""the daughter of a drug addict.""  I know what it feels like to be handled with kid-gloves because no one outside of your toxic bubble knows what to say to help.

I don't know what the future holds for anyone who loves an addict today.  One thing I know for sure is I am not alone.

Every weekend for the last 3-4 months I've been abusing cocaine, mdma, ghb, whippets, weed, alcohol. Starts on alcohol and coke everytime then just descends. I'm worried I'll descend from here. I can't get through an evening out without drugs. I was bending during the weekdays but I got that under control but now just launch every weekend and spend 48 hours every weekend just on an absolute bend, off my face, and I haven't had a weekend where I wasn't a complete mess in months. It's destroying friendships, my physical health is terrible I have the shakes and get such bad headaches, and yesterday for the first time I thought about ending it. This party lifestyle has got out of control. I called off sick yesterday and just cried all morning. My mental health is terrible. I know I'm just hiding/masking serious issues.
I'm not looking for sympathy I just needed to vent as a first step. I feel better typing this even if no one reads it.

I live with one of my best friends. I moved in with him last year because his mom kicked him out for being disrepectful towards her (this was already a red flag but the nice guy I am wanted to help him out). So at first, everything was good but after a while, I realised he had really bad mood swings for no apparent reasons (he pretty much woke up mad and would slam doors over petty things or do other childish stuff like that). I would talk to him about it and he would just tell me how his life sucked and that everything is always worse for him (he's a really negative person and he complains alot about not having women in his life but he doesn't do anything to change and doesn't listen to advices). 

So, he's got a drinking problem, at first I didn't mind it too much because when I was younger, we used to drink alot more (we're in our late 20s now). Thing is he drinks everyday. Sometimes I wake up on a week day, he is there being loud not caring about a thing, falling on the ground or talking very loud on the phone with a friend. I talked to him about it when he's sober, he would aknowledge the problem and be sorry, but he keeps doing it still, he doesn't wanna change.

Like I mentioned earlier, he's also got issues with women. He's never dated a girl (29 years old now), and he says that every little thing that happens in his life is worse for him because he never had a girlfriend, and that he tries but it doesn't work out (I'm kind of sceptical that he tries hard). He's depressed because of this and constantly says that he's just the unluckiest guy in the whole world and that his life sucks. I tried helping him at first saying he should try losing a bit of weight, that women would maybe find him a little bit more attractive, he's 5'6"" ± 250lbs, pretty much obese. He said he would but he's eating junkfood almost every meal and drinking almost everyday. He did get a one time date with a girl, but since he's got no experience dating (which she probably realized) she was getting distant with him, and then he would get very mad about it and text her that she's wasting his time pretty much.

When he's drunk he also likes to do coke. He sees it as no big deal, but everyone who does coke think they can stop whenever they want to, and then, get drunk and do coke again, and so it goes... He doesn't do some often though, maybe once or twice a month when he's really drunk or with friends who do coke.

I tried helping in many ways, giving him advices (especially about women and health) but he doesn't really listen to me much from what I see, he nods but doesn't change a thing and continues on with his old ways. I found him a job where I work. At first, he was happy but now he keeps complaining about how it sucks, I told him to get another one but he says that there are no other jobs (lol ok). 

Sorry for the long paragraphs, but I wanted you to get the portrait. What I wanna know from you guys is, how do I confront him ? How do I make him realize how he's the one digging the hole deeper and that it's not the world that is against him. Maybe this sub is not the right one for a question like this, but I figured out that you might know. Thanks for your help.",3

I told them that if I took it I would relapse and destroy a lot of the hard work I've done to get here, but they didn't stop until my friend stepped in. Not the greatest story but I just wanted to share and say that was fucking difficult.
I freaked the fuck out and left because I knew if I stayed there longer I would've taken it which is frustrating to say the least, but I didn't and ya boy is still clean from that shit.

Does anyone have any tips when they're around that kind of stuff? A lot of my good homies still do hard drugs, and it's so difficult go be around them or even be their friend because it's like I'm daring myself to break again.",81

I was off it for three goddamn years and then this summer I was back using. It started off recreationally and safe - maybe every other weekend and less than a gram. Then I met my current bf. He’s an addict (and in rehab atm) and I let him drag me down with him. We started off just occasionally using it but in large quantities. But soon it was almost everyday and 5-8 grams a session. Between us we’ve blown thru over $12,000 since mid august.

He’s been in rehab for about 10 days now but that hasn’t stopped me. I’ve been on a 5 day binge; and before that a 4 day with one day sober between. I’m blowing thru 8balls in two days. I’m fucked basically. 

The worst part is knowing it’s an issue but being too afraid to stop. I’ve felt so good and been so productive with cocaine. As someone who’s bi polar and experiences severe depressions it’s been a relief to finally feel ~good~ and not empty. I’m scared to be back to the depressions and emptiness. Really really scared. 

Anyways just needed to rant and get this off my chest. Sorry for the length!! 
Thanks for reading :)",4
2020-11-01 17:14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/jmb9mr/how_to_best_be_there_for_my_sister/,How to best be there for my sister,"This past June I discovered my sister is in the throes of addiction. The last I saw her she's gotten really thin, the sores from her skin picking have gone all the way to her feet and she nodded out in front of me. I've known there is a cocaine problem, and I think it's moved on to include heroin. I'm also pretty sure she's moved on to prostitution to support the habit.  


I have no naiveté/illusions about addiction and recovery. I've loved someone who got torn up by heroin, and I myself am a functional stoner and alcoholic. I see my sisters situation without judgement, but also tempered hope. There's no magic wand for this.  


So how do I best support her? I've seen her once in the past 6 months, and it hurt so much because I can see the physical damage and how much emotional pain she's also in. I felt paralyzed about the right way to act around her. We've never been close, and now there's this chasm between us. She knows about my substance issues (and the occasional sex work I've myself dabbled in), so I hope she knows I don't see her as inferior/dirty/bad, just as someone who's done the same stuff I have but have the bad luck of it going way wrong.

I'm wondering:

\- Do I bring up the addiction when I see her or let it lie? Is it better to continue to tell her I know and it's okay and I accept her where she's at, or to pretend like the elephant isn't in the room?  


\- Is there a point to a formal intervention? She knows mom, dad and I know -- or know enough to have brought it up and say we're aware of the substance problems, but there's never been a Big Moment where we're all together to express our love and support.  
(\^also hard since dad refuses to talk/engage with mom)  


\- If I am bringing up addiction should I encourage her to seek out services? Rehab is not an option financially, but mom has looked into lots of other services in the area to be armed and ready if sister ever has a moment in which she reaches out for help.  


Thanks for an input.",4

Please let me know if it’s not! 

Background context: From 2017- May 2019 I was in an extremely physically and emotionally abusive relationship with someone. I was cheated on and heavily relied on social media to help me find clues of what was going on. I relied on social media SO much that it became kind of like second nature, and I learned all the ways to obtain any info I wanted (anonymous instagram story viewer, checking followers, signing into accounts, etc). It mostly became my way of protecting myself. That relationship fortunately ended, but I felt like my tendencies on social media were still strong. I started going to therapy and have tried a variety of medications. I was diagnosed with PTSD after the relationship after already having very bad anxiety/attachment anxiety. 

Anyway, I entered a new relationship (24M), probably too soon after that relationship. I so badly wanted for my social media lurking addiction to be put behind me, since I had no reason to doubt this guy. During the relationship, it seemed like I couldn’t control those tendencies at the first sign of trouble. I would be so embarrassed after having to admit that I looked through his stuff or checked his social media as adamantly as I did. It’s a huge invasion of privacy and he understandably didn’t like that because he made an effort to be transparent. It’s not even like I WANTED to, but something inside me made it feel like I NEEDED to. A bad habit. If I didn’t, my anxiety would skyrocket. I would have to fight myself on that and go through phases where I would delete social media, stay away from his electronics, etc. I have no idea what’s wrong with me and why I do this so much. I don’t want to do it anymore. I want to trust as normally as I did before the relationship that gave me PTSD and have a normal social media presence since I actually enjoy it. 

Open to any advice at all. I hate this part of myself so much and I just want to be better.",2

I've been trying to quit for at least 4 years, managed 6 months once, 2 1 month stints, but I'm now working towards rehab because nothing else has has kept me clean. My partner wants to help me get clean, but no matter what I say, his way of doing it is to try and control me. To tell me to stop, take things away from me, tell me how awful it is for him. All things that drive me deeper, make me feel more desperate, mean I then carry his weight as well as mine and the addiction. . . . . I've given him information for and encouraged him to attend a support group for people who have friends/family in addiction. He refused. I've asked him to attend counselling (I found them, provided details, offered to pay), he at least contacted them, but filled out their survey in such a way they they're unlikely to take him on. I've given him the information for an incredible Insta account I follow to try and help him to understand, he won't look. I've explained over and over again that I can't go cold turkey safely because it's dangerous (advice of my alcohol service team) and he keeps trying to get me to stop as soon as my hangover has gone. . . . . . I almost wish he didn't support me, because it hurts more that he wants me to get better but isn't listening to anything I'm telling him, than if he was yelling at me for it. . . . .

I hope this shines any light to anyone.

The past 3 weeks I have lost everything that mattered to me. I have driven my wife away, I have put a space in between myself and my family in times where we really needed family. I have lost my own home. But truly the worst thing of all that I lost was myself.
    When I was 13 years young I lost my mother to brain cancer leaving my brother and I with a emotional abusive step father. Obviously at that age, losing your only parent is almost world ending to anyone especially for how close we were. Of course being that young I was struggling with attending school and maintaining relationships. My step father was never emotionally supportive and taught me that the way I must live my life now is to consume pharmaceuticals to ""get me back on track"". I was forced to take ADHD medication. Even when I first initially went to the doctor for it, once the doctor left the room with questions on paper for me to fill out, my step father took it out of my hands and filled it out by himself. I went on to take these medications throughout all of middle school and high school and once I turned 18 and had no more health insurance I had to stop taking it and turned to street drugs to fill the ""mental ill gap"". After obtaining my sobriety when I was about 19, I had everything in life that I ever wanted which included the love of my life. When I was 24 I lost both my grandparents in one day and didn't know how to cope with these feelings. I thought I had ""no motivation"", so I made several psychology appointments and doctor visits to obtain adhd medication. If that isn't motivation in itself idk wtf is.

 For the next 2 years I lived my days through a panic. Adjusted my needs and wants to fit in this short costly time frame of this euphoria that I was chasing and after my peak starts to dissolve, I chased any sedative substance to fight the anxiety and moodiness that the Vyvanse left behind. This way of life left me in a complete bullshit life, I couldn't express any normal happy emotions. I could hardly enjoy vacations or even live it up on my wedding day. 

I've got so much work to do and my first step is to fully detox this poison out of my system forever. I now have the support and trust that I need to get through this and I can honestly see the light at the other end of this horrific tunnel. 
 
The consequences that I am now facing is because of this life style and I have nobody to really blame other than myself. I hope that anyone here who is reading this and is struggling with any type of addiction can get through and reach their life to its absolute full potential because literally, everything that brings joy in your life will come as followed as you progress with your sobriety. You need to talk with people. Communication and support is its own medicine and it can do WONDERS for you. If you don't have that then do what I am doing, reach out for help. Engage yourself with others.

Alcohol makes me lose my inhibitions, I black out, I forget and I have horrendous hangovers. It was the reason behind my anxieties and failing relationships.... but I have decided that I wont do it anymore... 

But, instead I have started smoking weed. I have always dabbled a bit however, I've gone from a bit a few times a year to a gram a month to a quarter a week. More and more I'm realising I have an addictive personality!! 

Now, weed does not have the same negative impacts on my life. I'm in control, I'm relaxed and I do not have hangovers. But it is not great for my health. I enjoy running and since increasing the weed, I cant stop coughing after a run (I dont smoke normal cigarettes). It also all costs money!! Talk about not great either with a virus that attacks the lungs doubg the rounds!! 

So.... Should I give up weed and live a truly sober life? Or will I risk slipping down a slippery slope ladled with booze?!?! 

Advice greatly appreciated.",18

The first question when dealing with an addiction is not why the addiction but why the pain. What usually clinical psychologists find is an emotional loss or some trauma. In the case of severe addicts, almost every single one of them are traumatised, emotionally rejected, or neglected. Trauma separates people from themselves; it gives a very negative view of the world, and they act accordingly, defensively, grandiosely and aggressively. Thus, society responds in the same way, increasing the emotional rejections toward them, causing more psychological pain. The cycle reiterates, and the attempt to get away from suffering, to run far from themselves continues.

Most of the apps I find either overcomplicate things or are otherwise not what I'm looking for.  

  

I basically just want to be able to open the app and press a button and it will record that as 1 use. The reason it's so important to me that it be simple is that I am trying to give up meth, cold turkey isn't viable at the moment so I'm allowing myself to use on some days but still wanting to track how much and when I use on those days, meaning that I am pressing the button maybe 40+ times some days. I don't need any fancy analysis, I can eyeball that for my purposes.  

  

Any suggestions would be much appreciated, I have an Android phone.

And you should be ready to accept all the goods to come. 

I didn’t told my closest ones before I was 2months into rehab. Most because I was afraid to fail them. But geez all the support I got when I told them! Yes of these two months I failed many times, relapse and guilt and how disappointed I was in myself. All the lies I told them “yes things are going good for me”, shit.. those lies. 

My father contacted me again after many years and showed me support. He had been an addict himself and went tru hell. How I look up to him, it’s hard as hell. He was ready to accept all the downside. It’s been 6years since he touched anything beside nicotine. 

I am very proud, happy and joyful for everyone that is fighting. You guys are so strong keep doing that plz! 
Myself is another story. I was not ready to take this road into a life without addiction. I am more shameful about myself than ever, this is a feeling I need to get rid of. I should be proud of trying and failed. 

It has been 8months since I started on my rehab, and now I know I am not ready. I am afraid, shameful, and def not honest with myself. My uni degree is going to hell. But one thing is for sure, I need to be honest and accept myself. 

You should be ready 
‘addiction’ when I really cut u off my life. That will be the end of you. But for now I need to learn how to fail, how to be shameful for failing, how to be perfectly good without begin perfect. Watch me when the times comes.",10
