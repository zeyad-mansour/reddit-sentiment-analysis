i’m f, 21 and i recently was 100-ish days clean from cocaine up until this past halloween weekend. it started my sophomore(?) (17-18ish) year of college and it became an addiction very quickly. i lost a lot of weight and got compliments (i’m not very skinny to begin with), im supposed to be a senior in college now but i’m getting there. i relapsed on halloween week because i found out someone i knew sold for a cheaper price than i used to buy for and i “just wanted it for halloween” but it’s been a month now and i’ve kept buying. i don’t have the money for this habit and yet i can’t break it. im going through a rough breakup too so i’ve been doing this and drinking a lot more. falling so behind in school getting continually depressed, was diagnosed with bipolar this past summer and started mood stabilizers that don’t seem to be working much. was hooked on xanax for a while too but once i couldn’t get that anymore i started the cocaine again. with the break up i’m trying hard to focus on myself and pick up hobbies but since i started doing coke again it’s all i can think about, especially right now because i’m too broke to buy it. i guess im just asking what i can do to distract myself? i don’t know, this is all very new to me and i feel lost. i knew it was bad when i would do lines in the bathroom last year during thanksgiving, get drunk without my sister knowing and her being so happy im spending time with her when in reality i was just fucked up. i feel awful about it all but it’s so hard. it’s hard to focus on a hobby but i’m not medicated for that . the psychiatry and all is new and with my admission to being an addict and telling them i’m 99% sure i have some attention deficiency, it’s hard to get them to trust me with that kind of medication since i did abuse adderall a bit at one point . i feel like a burden to the people around me and myself",3,0

Now it’s quite obvious these days that so many teens are watching porn, and I’m one of them. It all started one day when I was on my phone and put sex into the browser (I know pretty stupid). What I found is something that I thought was absolutely gross at that time in my life (which was like when I was 11 or 12). But a day came around where I felt aroused/horny and suddenly this gross thing was something I was more than curious in. So I did the dirty that day and the feelings I had watching pornography were so strong and crazy. Like what the fuck, how does thing feeling exist without drugs. A week later this intense curiosity came back and then 3 days later and then the next day. 

This started a 2 year period of time where everyday I would watch porn in the bathroom before showering. As every addiction, this strong feeling died down through the weeks. 6 months from today, I realized really what was going on: I’m addicted and I don’t even know it. This whole time I thought I could stop at any time but why would I think that if I do it everyday? Why would I think that if the feeling to watch porn is more strong than the feelings I have watching porn? Why would I think that if all I think about when I see a girl is how sexy she is and how I could use her for my own desires? So in this moment of realization, I looked at ways to slowly break out of this, because I knew I couldn’t just stop instantly of course. 

The first tip I read about is opening up to parents but obviously this is much harder for me because to tell my parents that I’ve been addicted to porn for years and then they didn’t know would say that they are terrible parents. So my second option was to tell friends, which is much more easy to do. One night I told my best friend about something no one else knows. After me explaining my problem he told me a similar thing that has been happening to him too. That night I felt so accomplished and happy that I began my fight with my addiction.

Soon enough I told my girlfriend that I started dating a couple months ago about my problem as I thought that would be good for our relationship considering me and her wanted to be as honest as possible during our relationship. As I explained this to her, I emphasized and promised that porn would never come before her. She thanked me for such a such promise yet she seemed a little skeptical, although I have kept my promise. Something that I found absolutely amazing dating her is that she was someone that replaced porn when I felt something needed to fulfill my loneliness. She truly has helped me with my addiction without even knowing it. 

Today, I only give into the pleasure of pornography once a week by simply pleasuring myself without pornography, only the thoughts in my mind (Even then I do that once a week along with watching porn). I keep this down to once a week by what I currently do to stay out of my lustful thoughts. What I do is have a rubber band around my wrist all the time. When I get horny or have that desire to watch porn I slap the band on my wrist. This seems silly and stupid but for some reason it has a phycological effect on denying these thoughts and has worked for months.  

If you have gotten this far, THANK YOU. This is my first time confessing such a serious thing on the internet but I felt this community would understand, relate, and support my story. If you are someone who had my similar problem or is still going through the fight, say something in the comments as this community and I will help you and support you. One last thing is that I could have done more to get out of my addiction. It could of taken me only a month to get out of my addiction if I told my parents. But you can, I know it's hard but it's the best way to do it. Most likely your parents will do little to make you feel bad and a lot to help you because they love you. If you feel that is just to much, consider your higher power, if your religious at all. Pray to your God(s) or talk to a religious leader as they will do probably the same as your parents, simply help you not shame you. Help is out there. The only thing holding you from that help is yourself.",8,0

I've suffered with psycosis, depression and a personality disorder since as young as I can remember as well as abuse, causing me to have PTSD. I was victim to domestic abuse with my ex partner for 4 years which made my PTSD worse. I became homeless May 2020, and was moved to a new borough after living in a different county most of my life, during my time being homeless, I ended up under the local drug and alcohol services and on a methadone program.

I was receiving mental health treatment and prescribed anti depressants and anti psycotics, which I have taken on/off since I was about 15.

The doctor has just taken me off all forms of anti depressants and anti psycotics, instantly and didn't even wean me off and has said that they will no longer prescribe me my anti psycotics/depressants because they say my psycosis and mental health is drug related, which is completely incorrect, as I have suffered with psycosis and depression since I was as young as 12, and I was not using any substances and only started using substances in the last year, I also have an official diagnosis of a personality disorder, psycosis and depression given to me at 15. So my mental health is not a result of substance abuse, and in fact my substance abuse occured as a result of trying to self medicate for my mental health.

Since I am no longer taking any medication for my mental health, I am suffering really badly with my psycosis and depression and unable to cope.

Regardless of whether I use substances or not, I still suffer with psycosis, depression, PTSD etc and need treatment for these things but receiving no support for my mental health by my GP.

Who do I speak to/go to, to receive the right treatment and support, what services are available to me so that I can get the right treatment and support I need as I am unaware of what is available to me. Would it perhaps be a good idea to change GP surgery as I am not receiving treatment for my mental health at my GP and they are completely ignoring the fact that I have had on going mental health from a young age, before I was using any substances

I'd appreciate any advice.

I never used drugs really, just weed sparingly - but I was always such an anxious wreck that I never really liked it. 

Never tried opiates or uppers. Alcohol was just the love of my life! Until it wasn’t sustainable anymore. Or fun.

I have been prescribed lorazepam/Ativan since I was younger for my intense anxiety and panic disorder.

I’m 30 now - in recovery - I love AA and I participate in the program. I am just wondering what others thoughts are on taking an as needed benzodiazepine/narcotic while also in recovery from alcohol and enjoying AA and working the program.

I do not take it daily. I take it Sparingly. When my anxiety is really bad or I’m having a panic attack that tells me I need to go to the hospital. Thank you in advance for sharing your thoughts on this!",1,0

 Before she spiraled out of control we lived a good life, neither wanted for much. (I grew up in abject poverty and am an alcoholic, sober 20+ years now)

I have hard assets and i am financially ok.... she was too.... we had a good life ahead

Then she revealed her pill addiction had morphed to heroin (i literally have taken her to 2 dozen recovery/ addiction centers.... i tried hard to help her)

Once she spiraled to the point of living on the street or sleeping with dealers to keep her addiction going.... it became impossible to find resources to help her......

I cannot image how those addicts who start out with less turn their lives around.

I know that my money/my assets/ her assets/  our joint  assets kept and allowed her to hide the addiction for a long time....until it could not be hidden anymore

This article hit home for me because i know the poorest or least able suffer immeasurably hard.

We have such bad mental health support systems and addiction services for the least able in our society 

Truth is, rich middle or poor.... addiction is a disease that needs compassion and support 

This article hit home for me for some reason, maybe because i was so poor when i was a boy

I started drinking when I was 14 and I always had the urge to drink way too much, I still do that. Broke up with my abusive boyfriend of two years a few months ago and I started heavily drinking again, but mainly as a way to socialize because that's how I get to spend time with friends mostly. I even met a really nice guy recently while I was out drinking. So I mainly had nice experiences with drinking. 

The downside is the intense withdrawal symptoms I started getting after a 2-day bender, which has become very common for me to have on my weekends. I can never do anything on Sundays because I'm so hungover and I start shaking, feeling sick, even hallucinating... It's always the same and I can't stop because I'm scared of being alone on weekends since I don't trust myself especially when I'm really depressed. I don't drink alone, I used to do that when I was younger but I still think I might have started to have a serious issue with drinking. 

I don't go to social events sober. I drink at least a whole bottle of wine before attending any social gathering on weekends. I think my best friend fell down the same rabbit hole with me, we have kind of the same relationship with alcohol and I think we're dragging each other down. She knows that she has a problem but doesn't seem to care at all. I don't want to stop drinking. I don't care about myself and I used to think I would never get addicted to anything so I never worried about my drinking. Now that I am sobering up again on another Sunday I realised that I might have fucked myself over a lot with my reckless behaviour. I don't know what to do anymore.",2,0

I speak for myself only and my experiences. So the few who will have a problem with this should know that idgaf what you think so it'll be a waste of your time trying to argue, tell me I'm wrong, invalidate my feelings or experiences or the standard idiot phrase ""you can't get addicted to weed""

*Trigger warning I suppose 

Anyways. I'm today clean and sober for about 2 1/2 years. I got locked up in a psychward in the beginning of - 19 when I finally crumbled and managed to tell someone. I can't tell you how I managed to finally tell someone about how bad it was but I'm happy I did. I was locked up for about 14 days while on massive doses of antipsychotics. After that I was deemed stable enough to go home, with medication under the conditions of me starting rehab. I had very very bad nightmares. About violence to extreme degrees, motor functions were heavily impaired and the nightsweats... Like someone dumped a bucket of water on me several times every night. Shakes, anxiety, depression, psychosis, loss of weight (I weighed 59kg at midsummer 19)

I was admitted to rehab that was based on NA and group therapy and led by 2 therapists who were absolutete Rockstars in what they do. I didn't test negative until about 6 weeks after the last time I smoked. And it took another 4ish months to get me aware and stable enough to start working with the assignments. Fast forward to about 1 1/2 year after I started rehab and I ""graduated"". I have a certificate and everything! Yay me!

Cannabis was my one and only drug of choice. I still to this day vividly remember exactly what I felt the first time I smoked soon 15 years ago. It's scary how clear that memory is. I started as most people probably do. A couple of times a month. Then a week. But I promised myself that I'd never do it when working. And eventually it became every evening. And then every morning. Every time I ever left the house. And in the end Atleast once every hour. Every hour. 24/7. A few of the results of this was homelessness, enormous debts and a wide variety of mental health issues. But I wasn't addicted. I could stop any time I wanted. It was just weed. You can't get addicted to weed. Except I was. I couldn't function without it. I violated my morals, mind and body to just get my hands on a few g. I saved ashes so I could smoke it again if I ran out. I scraped tar out of my bongs and I spent hours and hours or hunting for small dropped fragments. The black shit I'd cough and hack up from my lungs were... Nasty to say the least.

With help and support I got better. Through giving up my old life I got a new one. One where my children are present and with me. It takes a lot of work. But I feel like where I am today is 1000 times better than the best times I've ever had before.

To all of you who's made it this far. You don't know me but still you do. I made it out alive and you can too. One day at a time and we'll make it to the end. You can be shown the door but only you can go through. I believe in you. I love you all because you loved me when I was unable to do so.

My pharmacy is only like a 5 minute walk but these days, I just have no energy or motivation to go, especially if I've had gear to smoke, as I wont need my methadone as I wont be having withdrawals so usually if I've had a smoke I won't go to the pharmacy at all.

Since I was punched in the face last year at night time by some random dude, leaving the house and going out is already quite a mission as its really knocked my confidence and made my anxiety and PTSD a lot worse, so this has had a big part to play in making me not want to go but on top of that, I just have no energy or motivation to do it.

I'm happy to go other places, I'll happily go walk to get a takeaway, to go get cigarettes, to pick up etc, and I don't mind walking far either, but going 5 minutes to the pharmacy is such a task and i hate doing it and I don't know why, I don't know why I'm okay walking anywhere and everywhere else except for the pharmacy..

My dad's been using H on and off for probably 5 or 6 years. I only found out when he went to the ER for withdrawals about 2 years ago.

This was all back in the beginning of 2020 and things were going fine. Turns out my dad stopped taking subs earlier this year and is back to using again.

59,2021-11-27 00:35:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/r36fz4/just_a_story/,Just a story.,"So there was this girl in high school, I don’t want to say her name, so I’ll just do the usual, generic substation. We will call her Jessica. Anyways, I had a massive crush on this girl, she didn’t know I existed. I fought with myself for like a week one time, trying to get up the courage to ask her out. Didn’t go well, obviously. 

So anyways, fast forward 6 years or something and I’m in line at a food court. I’m looking at this girl, she looks super familiar but I’m having a hard time placing it. I mean, where would I know a strung out, bags under the eyes, needs to eat all the sandwiches, looking girl. Then it dawned on me, and at almost the exact same time, it dawned on her too. Jessica. 

It was pretty awkward honestly. She was the one to come over and say hi. She didn’t remember my name, of course, and I pretended like I didn’t remember hers. This was THE girl in high school. I would have given her the world, I put her on an absurdly high pedestal without even really knowing her, like at all. I had never actually had a conversation with her, but I had imagined plenty. Anyways, back to the story. She asked how I was doing. I told her I was doing great, had graduated college, gotten a pretty good job, been at the gym, you know, the usual stuff. I politely asked how she was doing, which wasn’t really polite to ask, because I knew the answer couldn’t honestly be good, but I didn’t know what else to say. Small talk is all just bullshit anyways right? 

She told me that she had gone to college too! She was really close to graduating but had a hard break up and she had to withdraw from some of her classes, but not to worry, she was going to make them up as soon as she got a couple things straightened out in her life. But yeah, she was good! Not great, but she is still here and she is about to bounce back up and everything will be good in another year or so. She would suck my dick for $100.. fucking what?!?!? She literally dropped that in at the end of a sentence just like that. I must have looked shocked as a motherfucker cause she instantly was like “seriously, it would help me out and I promise you are going to love it!”. 

I was fucking floored. She doesn’t just do this all the time though. It’s just been tough lately. 

Now, reader, I don’t want you to be too worried about her. As forward as this proposition was, she still had her dignity. I was just a good opportunity. I mean she doesn’t suck dick for money all the time, but she knew I had money. My story and my appearance said that I did. She knew that there was sentimental value that she could add on top of her usual fee. She don’t go around sucking dick for anything under $30. She wasn’t THAT bad, unless of course she was super desperate, in which case she might do it for $20, but only if you promised to pay at least another $20 later… cause you don’t get the cheapest price AND credit. She also used a condom every single time. Unless neither of you had one and you had the drugs right there, so there was no time to go get one. BUT only in those kinds of circumstances.

So, after that awkward confrontation, or conversation, or reunion or whatever the fuck it was I went home and did something I quickly regretted, I told the homies. They all got a kick out of it. The consensus was pretty much that it was sweet karmic revenge. She rejected me, now I got to reject her, and at the end of the day I definitely was better off. But as much as they thought she deserved it, it didn’t feel like that to me. What she deserved was all of the things I dreamt of giving her when I held that crush. She deserved the day dream lifestyle, not this. 

Addiction would soon take her. It of course had already taken her. Many times. 
It took her innocence, it took her dignity. It took her past and her future. It stole her from her family, the one she was born into, the one she made amongst her friends, the ones she never got to have with the man she never got to marry. It took her honor, and it took her memory. Many people were hurt when she passed, but secretly some were relieved. How fucking terrible is that. It stole everything from her. What a hideous fucking disease. And you know what else, had she died some normal tragic death, she would have been mourned. People would have talked about how horrible it was, but instead some people, who think they are the salt of the earth types, thought that she got what she had coming. She made her choice and she suffered the consequences, good riddance. No one misses a criminal like that. 

What I wish is that we had some sort of machine, some way of showing people just how close they came to having an ending like that. Some way of seeing how it was good luck, or coincidence, or the good works of others that kept us from going down that road. Something to show them that THEY didn’t have SHIT to do with how good their life ended up. Something to show them that they had within them exactly what they hated in others.

You don’t understand how beautiful this girl was. How amazingly, desperately, terribly beautiful she was. WAS. Will never be again. No one will ever pay for what was done to her. And I truly hope that no one gets what they deserve like she did. None of this makes sense, but at least we are too blind to see that.",35,0

Im very glad he did this because even i could see it needed to happen. 



But he is having withdraws i believe. He says theres an ache in his chest and his body feels almost numb.

Struggled with drugs my whole life. Lately I've been on a run thats lasted nearly 3 years. It started while I was living in Florida and i brought that bullshit with me back home to Pennsylvania. Fentanyl, meth, cocaine. All intravenous. Prior to that, I had clean time upwards of 4 years working in the addiction treatment field and being an active member of a 12-step fellowship. But I refunded my misery by thinking that I could be a better lover with opioids. The relentless pressure from my ex to sexually improve (i know I made the conscious decision) lead me to think that opioids were my only choice.

Fast forward to 60 or so days ago. I decide to make a change because I've totaled my car, lost my job, strained every relationship there ever was, and have decided to take my own life or change. I forced myself through the agony of those first 5 days without opioids and then put together a few more days and a few more and then almost had 2 months.

The second I get a car, I hit the plug up and I'm shooting dope like I never stopped. I haven't used today, and I don't plan to. But what the fuck? I worked HARD for those 60 days and its like sweet mother misery beckoning me to hell. I wouldn't wish dope sickness on my worst enemy. But ill put myself through the shit even though I KNOW the outcome. Its a bona fide fact that the streets are undefeated and we suffered mass casualties in the war on drugs. But in that moment of weakness, the devil creeps in and says ""fuck all that"". There has to be a way to stay stopped. Idk why the most ratchet and hurtful substance in my life is so attractive.

In the 60 days I stopped, I got a new job, paid fines, did a bunch of productive stuff and I risk it all as soon as I come up with a car.
I'm terribly fearful that I'm doomed to relapse every time I get a taste of money or success. Yall know how it is: use because it's raining and use because its sunny. Use when its my birthday and use when my homie dies.

I just wanna maximize my potential. I've read countless books, peer reviewed medical journal entries on addiction and opioid use disorder, autobiographies of other addicts, and more recovery literature than I can count. But no one that I've ever come across has appropriately described or recalled how you're ball-and-chained by opioids. The shit just consumes your mind in a truly evil way.

I've always had a bad habit with this, it's something I do when I'm anxious, angry or stressed but using has made it 10 times worse.

In fact, I don't think I do it when I'm anxious, stressed etc anymore, I only really do it when I'm high or when I'm having cravings.

I hate it.

My mouth is always really sore and my hands just look so rotten, and for a female, it's not a good look, especially as I'm someone with very small and dainty hands.

I also hate that playing around with my pipe makes my hands filthy and always wrecks my nail polish. I love to paint my nails, but within 24 hours, all my paint and everything is scratched off.

Does anyone have any good tips or advice on controlling the picking/biting habit?

When I used to do coke/MDMA, I had no control of my mouth AT ALL. I would have literal holes inside my mouth and I've never been able to get control over it and stop myself from doing it.

I know you can get stuff that you paint on your fingers to make them taste gross, but that doesn't help when you pick with your nails and what can you do to stop the biting in the mouth?

My family typically hears from him at least once a month, but we went through a four month stretch of radio silence. I’m 21, in college and working two jobs so it’s really difficult for me to find time to do much other than beg my family to do something and find him. 

They basically said it was a lost cause. Finally I got fed the fuck up and drove to Denver, looked for him and finally found and took him home thanks to some tips from his ex. 

He’s been homeless for all four of those months, occasionally being allowed to stay on his exes couch if it was too cold. But it’s freezing out now, and it’s only going to get colder. 

The first day (Wednesday) was hard. He wanted to leave after two hours. He tried to leave and then we took him back home because it was snowing. He wanted to leave two more times but after his dad talked to him on the third time he stayed the whole night. 

I couldn’t sleep, he and I slept on the couch and I just was so scared that when I woke up he’d be gone.

Thanksgiving, most of the day he’s okay but he starting randomly shouting loudly or talking to himself. No biggie, I assume this is due to social isolation after four months of being homeless. But I suffer from BPD so it’s probably easier for me to understand than my family. Coping mechanisms are hard. At the end of the night he got particularly hostile, yelling “Fuck this” and screaming in his room.

Which leads us to this morning. He was laying naked on the couch and had clearly been eating peach cobbler with his hands, and when we told him to get cleaned up and dressed (I have a 16 year old little sister), he began screaming at us to fuck off and that he hates this. 

Recovering is hard and I understand that. He needs patience and support right now. My parents are far less understanding, and are saying he’s doing all of this on purpose to spite them. My mom literally told me “he can go back to sucking cock in an alleyway if he wants to disrespect us like this.” Like what the fuck. 

This infuriated me because when I first found him and brought him home, he kept telling me how embarrassed he was, that he knows this isn’t how he usually is and that he’s ashamed of how his brain is now. 

I want him to get help. Unfortunately he’s 27 and is no longer on our parents insurance. Does anyone have any advice on how to support him better, or resources for my parents? I go back to school in two days, so after that it will just be them watching after him. I’m worried that they’ll make this worse.

A lot of the posts on here are about harder drugs, however, for me, it was weed that ruined my life. I've had horrible issues with depression and anxiety ever since I was 12. Funny enough, growing up I hated all drugs. the only experience I had with drugs was that I knew that boys were mean to me and didn't give a shit about me when they were high. I hated that and it hurt deeply. Things changed when I got to college, a friend convinced me that I should smoke weed. As soon as I smoked, I felt insane relief. For the first time in my life, I had a way to numb the horrible pain I felt every day for the past 6 years. I started smoking every day. I started to eat so much. I had gained 50 pounds in 6 months. I was always skinny and had never struggled with my weight before. I desperately hated the weight I gained, this turned into me developing an eating disorder and losing 50 pounds, and becoming so skinny. then the cycle again. I now have the worst relationship with food. I have stretch marks all over my body, permanent scars, from all the food I ate while smoking. Not only did weed make me fat and scar my body, but it also took all my money. I was spending 100 dollars a week. Weed no longer became fun, the constant coughing, lungs killing me. I hate how I was always told ""weed is okay"" it's not a ""real drug"". Weed has taken so much for me. I am 22 and in my last year of college, and although so many memories are a blur due to this horrible substance I am glad that I figured this out in my early 20s. I am not going to be a 30-year-old who doesn't remember her 20s. I am going to be fit, happy, healthy, and drug-free. three weeks clean after 3 years of smoking every day. The hardest thing I've had to go through. Just venting <3.

You are born; your brain, once pure 
Uninfluenced  by environment, unaware of your chemically predisposed pathway disorders. Just pure 
    
You grow up and become exposed to:

Caffeine  for its energetic allure 
Nicotine,  and perhaps because 
You’re sure, 
You can give it up, socially smoke 
But the opportunity for that social smoke 
Will come up once more 
Why do we endure 
The things that make us high, and then what makes us cry, what make us LIVE what eventually makes us die 
 what we once thought was cool and what we thought was fine 
and yes that stuff is relatively benign. But that chemical reliance for a good life must  eventually decline 

we know where that goes. We now see the world differently  

What was perhaps through an infantilised lense of the world- yes back then we saw it shine 
but now 
I’m 26 and it’s an internal struggle of a falsified happiness and now it’s those  drugs that helps us just to get by 
It might change... I hope... I don’t think so but  I’m sure I’ll  know with time 

That drug whatever it is was an enhancement of our world we never new but now we know it’s not the same - 
We grew up. The realisation of life’s hardships, the words injustices
 we know differently now and now it gives us pain. 
 and we just want to cover it up 
With drugs we continue. 
Not for fun and now, continued use brings a chemical restructuring in our brain. 
Permanent, irreversible? I’m no scientist - Seratonin, dopamine seeps through some membrane 
And we recover, it’s  ‘replenished’ ready to go for the next insane 
Hours and hours and hooours of party

I have stayed in recovery houses done intensive outpatient, worked with a sponsor ,while going to meetings everyday and I always end up at the same place. When I'm sober I always end up wanting to kill myself just as much as I did when I was using and it always leads me to insane behavior which leads me back to the drugs. I'm using thc daily and trying to limit my use of other drugs now which I know is basically insane based on my history of relapse, but I am just not ready to change. I attend 12 step meetings everyday and iop still so maybe I have some desire, but I have been really feeling the consequences of using the last 3 months on this last relapse emotionally and socially. I'm depressed I hate myself and everybody else and I'm pushing everybody away who is trying to help me.

I assumed it started when I was younger and I would lay with my mom as she would blow dry her hair and when she would set it down in between brushing her hair, I would have the warm air hitting my face or head and I would fall asleep almost instantly. The noise, the warmth, even maybe the actual vibration from it has now become something I crave and use almost everyday if possible. If I go on vacation with my family I either bring one, make sure my sister or mom is bringing one, and worst case scenario, I assume that whatever hotel we are going to stay in, provides one. Usually if I don’t have my own hotel room I have to limit my use because no one else tolerates the noise or even the heat for a long period of time , but if I’m granted even just 5-10 minutes with it, I feel happy. Or I will make excuses to either get to the room before everyone else or I will stay in the room while others go out just so I can be alone with my warm air machine. I don’t have withdrawals from it, but there will be times where if I have a stomach ache or I’m just stressed, I will wish I was nearby any type of hair dryer. I fully understand that this leans towards “weird” but it is something that I do at friends houses, on my own, or wherever it is possible. Makes me feel cozy, relaxed, and takes away stress. Also any girl I’ve dated either only found it weird at first and just tolerated simply because they loved me, but I’ve also noticed that many people after seeing me use it and finding out my reasons behind the use, at times catch themselves Doing it here and there . Is this an actual addiction ? Does anyone else do this ? I usually run it and let it hit my stomach, especially if I just ate and have gas or cramps, but also to sleep I’ll run it on my hands or sometimes put it far enough where there is a small gust of warm air hitting my head or face but not close enough to blow my face up in case it ever overheats.",5,0

Every day that passes I see both of us getting worse her mental illness and my drug addiction. I took a vow when I married her that I would never leave her side and and I'm going to keep my word. But I don't want to lose her and I know she doesn't want to lose me but something's got to give. My family wouldn't take care of her and help her if I was to go to rehab and she is uncontrollable when I'm not around. The the hospital has told me that if she doesn't want the help or the or the medicine that they can't force her. I'm running out of time and ideas 4 me too keep providing. Can anyone offer any advice or anything really to help me figure out what direction I need to take 2 get myself clean and to get her stable so we can get back to a normal life if that's possible. I'm out of ideas and I'm thinking I need a long time six months at least rehab but I'm so worried about her well-being and her Mental Health if I was gone that long. I probably wouldn't stay unless I know 100% that she was getting the help she needs to. We have been married 8 years and her schizophrenia didn't hit her until we were already married 6 years in. My family disgust me with things they've have said like just leave her and divorce her and that's something I can never do.,8,0

I'm an addict in every sense of the word from drinking to gambling to drugs. I have always been able to shut it off though and live a happy life. 4 months ago my wife left with kids and I have spiraled out of control. I haven't spoken to them since that day and have been trying like hell to stay clean with slip ups when I get so depressed,thoughts of suicide engulf my head and the only thing that calmed me was a hit or two. But this time around I have to stay clean, I have the mindset to get it done. I'm stuck in my ways and walk away from scenarios that arise. However the only person I have left in my life is the one who started it all from the get go. He has helped me out of serious anxiety attacks and depression holes I couldn't see the light of. Is currently letting me stay with him until I can get back on my feet but continuously is getting high and when he sees me getting upset reaches out the wrong hand I need. I have slept in my car more nights the past year than I have in a bed but I don't know how long I can continue to step out when he's doing it, meanwhile my life is not getting any better and going back to living in my car seems to only make things worse. my family means the world to me and with thanksgiving tomorrow I know that I'm going to be in a very dark place without them. I have to stay clean for them weather they care or not. But without a single other person in my life I know I'm going to fuck up if I don't hear my kids voices soon. How have any of you climbed out of Rock bottom by yourself. Is there resources besides speaking with therapists. I don't need therapy. I need a place to sleep at night and a shower so I can get back to the workforce and turn things around. Why is staying clean so easy when things are looking good but anxiety and depression kicks in and it's the first thing to turn to, to ease pain?

86,2021-11-25 01:34:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/r1q5tb/which_prescribed_meds_make_you_the_sleepiest/,Which Prescribed Meds Make You The Sleepiest?,"Hi I'm in the UK and I'm looking for what anti psycotic, sleeping tablet (except zopiclone and promethazine) and anti depressants have the most drowsy affect. I can't take quetiapine, cos although it made me sleepy, when I was increased to 400mgs it was making me have incredibly strong hallucinations and I literally had no control over my actions, my body was just doing it's own thing and it was almost like I was responding physically to dreams I was having while awake.

I have really bad insomnia and don't really get tired often.

I also CRAVE and want to feel tired most days when I'm ready to go to sleep, as I never feel tired and I also like the feeling of being tired.

I'm currently on Mirtazapine (M) and Olanzapin (O) and they're just not doing the job for me.

I was originally on Cytalopram(C), Olanzapin (O) and Promethazine(P) (for my sleep) but they took me off both C and P and replaced them with the Mirtazapine but they won't give me sleeping pills to take as well as M and O because the M and O makes you drowsy and I was fine just having O and P but they said if I took M, O and P it would literally knock me out (which is a real shame because that's what I actually want).

Because I'm not getting sleepy and want to feel tired, I usually end up taking more than my prescribed dose just so that I can get myself feeling sleepy in the way I desire and I end up running out of my meds way before I'm due a new prescription and then I'm buggered because I have NOTHING at all to make me feel sleepy anymore.

I need to change my meds and have a review of them with my Dr soon so I'm looking for something that's going to make me as tired as possible. I have to take anti psycotics, anti depressants and depending on whether only one of those things make me drowsy, I will take sleeping pills too.

When I took O with the C and P, it kind of give me the tiredness that I needed but I was still having to take more than my prescribed dose to achieve this. 

I need an anti-psycotic and depressant that has a strong sleepy affect OR a non drowsy anti depressant with a strong drowsy anti psycotic that I can take alongside P or another sleeping tablet if you can suggest one that I will be able to take, I can't ask for Zopiclone as they will only prescribe me enough of these for a week.

If I had my medication sorted out and help getting me sleepy, I think it would give me a good chance and make it easier for me to give up using Heroin, as this is the only thing at the minute that is making me feel sleepy enough and giving me the feeling I want and helping me get to bed, I want to feel like I can't keep my eyes open as it's the only way I can get to sleep, the only time I got close to this was when I took 30-50mg of O and 50-100mg of P (which is about double to quadruple my prescribed dose). 

So to recap, we need:
1. An anti-psycotic with the strongest sleepy affect
2. An anti-depressant with the strongest sleepy affect
3. The strongest sleeping tablet I can take for the whole month, on repeat to take regularly

Please give me your answers too. My paragraphs for this one were really quite long, go ahead and skip read them, cos I would, but I think I've written some good stuff too so if you can be bothered to read it all, please give it a chance and read through properly.

I'll go first

Top 5 - Softer Drugs
1. EVERYTHING tastes soooo amazing when you're stoned and have the munchies and it temporarily makes you a culinary genius too. I'm pretty sure shite with sugar on would taste nice when you're stoned

2. When I'm stoned I get inspired to and can all of a sudden have the effort/energy and be bothered to clean, and when I clean, everything's spotless. I don't know if other people get this but I do, I all of a sudden enjoy cleaning, and being stoned makes me notice everything that's dirty or messy so I do an even better job than when I'm sober. Usually when I'm sober, I will cut corners or not clean so intensely, mostly because I just don't enjoy it and cant be bothered, but when I'm stoned, I notice every dirty, messy, out of place thing and I want everything to be spotless and clean so badly and I cannot leave anything until it's tidy and sorted, I seem to notice dirt and stains and marks more when I'm stoned too, like I have super vision all of a sudden, like my vision temporarily turns UV and I can see every spot of dirt. In my ten years of smoking weed, I never used to be like this with cleaning, but after a few sessions on magic mushrooms, I developed a love for cleanliness when stoned. This actually started on a mushroom trip, where all of a sudden, I could notice every bit of dirt and things untidy and out of place and had an intense need to clean and tidy, but I then ended up having this after, everytime I smoked weed.. strange

Funny story, when I lived with my mum for a year, she was totally chill with me smoking weed in the garden, and even encouraged it, and sometimes even helped me buy it, because she loved the fact that the house would end up spotless, and she hates cleaning, like me. 
I stopped smoking weed last year, and as well, unfortunately got into heavier stuff, and I definitely miss smoking weed for the reason that my place would always be tidy and I was able to enjoy house chores, where as now I just can't be bothered, don't have the energy, and quite frankly don't care either. I'm naturally an untidy person and dread house work, but harder drugs have made this 100% worse.

3. I love having deep, crazy thoughts and conversations with myself or other people. I love how the mind goes down so many rabbit holes. I used to love watching conspiracy videos or things like ancient aliens when high or having deep conversations with people. I think this happens because weed heightens your paranoia and fear and your paranoid parts of your brain cause you to have these deep thoughts about things going on in the world, like conspiracies, aliens, secret government stories etc. I don't really get this, unfortunately anymore. My psycosis has got so bad that weed just makes me outright paranoid, I'll get paranoid that people i love are gonna die soon, or that I'm dying, I've even got paranoid and outright convinced that my fiance was gay or cheating on me, and when you get paranoid about something when you're stoned, for some reason, you straight away believe it to be true and fact and can't be reasonable about these things and look at all the reasons why these things aren't actually true, it's almost like when you're stoned and you have these thoughts, that the weed has opened up your intuition or opened up something in your brain which is able to interpret and sense this information and you fully believe it to be true, and even though when you're sober you never worry about or think about these things and only get paranoid about it when you're stoned, you can't just tell yourself ""dude, you only get worried about this once youre high"" 🤦🏻‍♀️ stupid, stoned brain

4. Watching films, TVs, videos etc when stoned/tripping on hallucinogenics is just a unique and amazing experience. Some things are more funny, some times you notice things in the film that you wouldn't have noticed sober, you notice when weed jokes and references are being made when these things completely go over your head sober, sometimes watching things, it triggers that deep thought/conspiracy part of your brain, especially watching things like ancient aliens.

Because I am psycotic, my experiences when stoned are a lot more intense and probably a lot different to people who don't have psycosis. One thing that I experience when watching things when I'm stoned is that the people in the videos start communicating with me, reading my mind and responding to my thoughts, responding to things I am doing, for example, I would leave the room and the person on the video would say something like ""and now shes left the room"", I have had another experience where I was making noises out loud, going ""ah"" ""ah"" and everytime I made those noises, the person in the video would get interrupted, as if my noises were actually interrupting what they were saying, I have even said things to the people on the videos like ""you're so funny"" ""you're so handsome"" and they would respond like ""thank you very much"", I've even had a response of one of the people going ""see, did you hear that?"" .. Now, I don't know if I'm completely imagining this all or it's a lot of coincidences, but one thing I have wondered is, what if the weed opens certain parts of your brain up or allows you to be in a different dimension, and what if the thing that you are watching is genuinely communicating with you and able to see and hear you? What's interesting is that I still experience this while sober as well sometimes, it's just a lot more noticeable and intense when I'm stoned, almost like there is a better line of communication, like the weed gives me a better signal 😂. What if someone or something is using the images and people on screen to talk to you? I've watched a program sober and then watched the same program stoned, and the whole content of the show is completely different, it may begin the same, for example, but the second time watching they no longer follow the script, instead there is actually some sort of interaction and communication with you and some other being(s), maybe aliens? Maybe spirits? Who knows. I've had it happen with many programs and videos, I haven't really experienced it with films, but certain TV shows and online videos I've had this, and different types of shows have different results, for example, a panel show or a quiz show, I will experience having actual physical conversation and interaction with the guests on the show directly, where as a sitcom or soap, I will have experiences like I will be thinking of something and the people in the show will respond to my thoughts indirectly, for example, if I'm thinking ""I'm really depressed about life right now"", one character will talk to another character and say something like ""oh Bob, you don't need to be depressed, cheer up"" or ""oh Bob, see, look at Sarah, she's depressed and needs cheering up"", where as on a panel show for example, the host or guests/quiz players will talk directly to me or about me or be affected by things I say, so although there is always a type of communication, the format of the show won't change. I'm interested to know if any of you have experienced this sort of thing?

5. I LOVE going for walks and being outdoors when I'm stoned, including road trips and car journeys. I used to walk 5 hours a day round my park and forrest when I was a stoner and I enjoyed it so so much, it's such a spiritual and ethereal experience, you can really feel the different energies and vibrations around you and connect with everything. 

I really used to enjoy going on car journeys (as the passenger obviously), I would especially love going at night, mostly, and go star gazing, looking for aliens/UFOS etc. I would always drive round the areas near me that are known for UFO sightings, alien sightings, highly spiritual places. I'm pretty sure when you're intoxicated, you do open up parts of your brain which allow you to see and experience things, you can also sense and feel different energies and vibrations. I've had many UFO and alien experienced and sightings (I have had these sober too, but they're more enjoyable when you're stoned).

I had one experience which I'll never forget, which always shocks me and also confirms to me it was real. I was stoned, with a friend who was completely sober, looking out our garden window, and I could see someone moving around our garden that looked like they had an invisibility cloak on, you couldn't see the person, but you could see something human height, human weight/shape, that had some sort of cloaking/invisibility device, moving round the garden, it then stepped up onto the patio and then stood right Infront of the back door, stopped and just stared at us. All of a sudden, the thing stepped forward, straight away and come right up close to the door and both me AND my sober friend jumped, I thought I was seeing things cos I was stoned, then my friend said ""omg did you see that?"" I was shocked that they could see it too, as I knew they weren't tripping from taking anything as they were completely sober/clean, and I replied ""you saw it too? I thought I was just hallucinating"" when they said to me, ""yeah, I saw it move all around the garden, it was like when Harry potter had his invisibility cloak on, you could see it was kind of blurry and wavey, a bit like you could see electricity"", I nearly pooped and peed at the same time, cos I knew what I had seen was real as they had seen it too, which also made me realise that some of the other things I had seen and experienced stoned, may have been real too and not just hallucinations

Top 5  - Hard Drugs

1. Maybe a bit TMI, but always having solid bowels and never getting the shits (unless you're withdrawing) is such an awesome thing, and something which I surprisingly never knew I would be so grateful for, and when you do end up going, it's just such a pleasant experience omg

2. Being able to be pretty much content with pretty much anything and any situation and not being bothered by things that much. Although the downside to this is that you're not bothered anymore by things to the point that you just stop looking after yourself, making yourself look good, you're not really affectionate or romantic with your partner, you lose all interest in sex and you are able to accept most things which also means you don't make effort to give yourself a good life/lifestyle, it's also nice to not worry and stress about things anymore, you're not always wanting more and being greedy or you don't get unsatisfied/dissapointed/unhappy when you don't have what you want. Its also nice to no longer have self esteem issues, you can look in the mirror for 5 minutes and just be like ""ah fuck it, I look fine, I'm going out"" rather than spending an hour trying on multiple different outfits, still not being happy and then spending your whole time while your out, thinking people are judging you or think you look bad, I used to notice people looking at me all the time, sometimes judging me, I used to worry what every person that walked passed me thought of me, and now I don't care what anybody thinks about me anymore, even if I look like utter shit, I just don't give a damn what anyone thinks anymore, having a fiance who loves me and accepts me and doesnt judge me or ever put me down helps with this massively as this also makes me not bothered by other people's opinions as the only one that matters to me is his, but I don't even really care if he thinks I look like crap anymore either and this is a massive relief in my life. My low self esteem and worry/paranoia of people's judgement, thinking I'm ugly etc, would be something that would bother me and be on my mind and stress me out pretty much 70% of everyday, always worrying, ""does this look ok? I hope I'm not too spotty? Does my hair look messy? Do these clothes match"" is exhausting, and to not have a single though like that running through my head is pure bliss.

Being able to be content in any situation is also an amazing gift. We spend most of our lives always wanting more, wanting better, we're never happy with what we've got, we are ungrateful, we always think the grass is greener on the other side. Want a bigger house, better car, a better partner, a better job, more money, more clothes, and living like this is actually shit and negative and destructive. I've always wanted the ability to be content and grateful with my present situation, once you're able to be content, you're truly winning, as you're no longer dissapointed, no longer unsatisfied, no longer unhappy where you are, once you're content, it's pretty hard to be miserable too, it stops you from being so worried, so stressed, so unhappy. I would rather be content than be happy all the time, id rather be able to be content in a small little flat, than be in a huge, big mansion. Being content is one of the keys to having a balanced, positive life and I have that right now and it truly does make living easier. You could be homeless, on the street, but if you were able to be content with that situation, that situation wouldn't feel or be so bad anymore, you'd be able to just get along with it and continue your life and find positivity in it. Its also nice to no longer be affected by or care about past trauma, grieving, be affected by PTSD, dwell on and regret the past and your choices, still feeling guilty for things, feeling dissapointed with and having hatred towards yourself. I used to spend most of my days always thinking about my domestic abuse experience, reliving that continually, grieving for my child, my family, feeling such pain and emptiness all the time, always feeling so mad at how unfairly I'd been treated, always dwelling on how people have done so many bad things to me, I was constantly depressed and miserable, always crying, always self harming, always ending up in hospital from attempted suicides, everyday I just wanted to die because my thoughts were consuming me and bringing me down, and now, that's all just gone, it doesn't bother me anymore, I don't care, I don't feel the pain, the regret, I don't live in the past anymore, everyday is a new day, everyday my mind is refreshed, I live in the present, it's like I'm born again everyday, I have no thoughts or memories of the past anymore, I lived continually in the past, reliving everything everyday rather than my mind being focused on the here and now, but now that's all stopped, I don't think about who did me wrong, how I've been hurt, how I've missed out, how I miss people, my mind refreshes everytime I wake up, I don't think about yesterday, I don't think about the morning either, even if me and my fiance had a big fight the day before, by the next day it's gone, it's done, I'm not holding any grudges or continuing the war, as today is a new day. I assume it's being intoxicated that causes me to care less and not be so bothered, rather than it being how my mind has evolved and developed and just how I think and feel and deal with life now, so I'm too scared to get clean and find out whether it's the drugs or if ive just become like this anyway. This is one of my biggest fears, that I'll get sober and all of a sudden, I'm living in the past all the time again, I'm worried/paranoid at people's judgement and have low self esteem again, I can no longer be content and will always be dissapointed and unsatisfied and miserable with my life and where I live, I'll start being bothered and upset by everything, because I never want to go back to feeling ANY of these things.

3. Even though withdrawing is literally the worst thing in the world, like honestly, I've had a REALLY shitty life.. like I've been abused and assaulted multiple times, bullied, sexually abused/assaulted, suffered with mental health most of my life, lost a lot of loved ones, and I would probably choose to experience most of those things from my past again than go through withdrawals. If at the end of a week, I would be clean of opiates and have them out of my system and I was given a choice, then I would rather go back in time and spend a week being domestically abused again, than a week going through withdrawals.

HOWEVER, on the flip side, there is NO GREATER FEELING than taking opiates when you are having withdrawals. That minute when you've been sweating, shaking, having pains in your belly, can't eat, can't sleep, have excruciatingly painful legs and back and you take your methadone or smoke a pipe and it kicks in, that is literally a little taste of heaven, there is no greater feeling or relief than that, honestly. I'm someone who really does take the bad with the good and the good with the bad, I wouldn't want to have everything perfect and everything to be good all the time, and even though when things are tough, it frigging sucks, there is no greater feeling or relief when the pain ends and good things happen to you again as you can appreciate, cherish and be grateful for the good times better, and bad times and experiences help us to grow, shapes us, makes us stronger and helps us learn and I truly embrace that. Which is why I would class this as a good thing to me. Yes, ideally, it would be better if I didn't experience withdrawals and didn't have to take methadone everyday, but at the same time, I wouldn't be able to experience the great relief and joy and pleasure I get when my withdrawals are cured, I would rather be able to have that experience than have no withdrawals and not get to feel that at all, it makes you more grateful for it. Same as having a baby, if the whole experience was easy, painless, I don't think the experience would be half as good, I don't think you'd be as grateful to have that baby, if you didn't get all the challenges that come with it, there's something strangely enjoyable about getting morning sickness, bad back, feeling tired all the time, having labour pains, getting the baby out, never having any sleep when it's born, always having sore nipples, all of that, it makes you feel special, you embrace and enjoy it because it's what makes you a mother, a strong woman, it's something which only you and your child experience together, something men will never experience, it creates the energy and feeling of such a unique love, that you went through all of that because you wanted and loved that child so much, and most of all, when the baby is finally out, that feeling of relief that all the pain and tiredness and stress is over, when you finally have that release, it's the greatest, incomparable feeling, there is no feeling nicer or greater or better than the moment when pain, suffering and stress finally ends.

4. The lifestyle opens you up to having unique, memorable and sometimes life changing experiences, as well as meeting special, unique, interesting and different people. Only being an addict/being involved with drugs allows you to have certain experiences that other sober/clean people would never have the chance of having. Sometimes these experiences may not always be positive ones, but nevertheless, these experiences shape us, teach us, open our eyes and our minds up to new things and these experiences are unique sometimes too. The lifestyle gives you a certain type of knowledge towards and for things, a knowledge that sober/clean people will never have, it changes your perception of the world, (sometimes negatively for others), but for me, this is one of my top 5's as it's changed my perceptions positively. Most of the negative perceptions I have towards the world and towards people, have come from bad experiences with sober/clean people, where as my interactions with users/addicts have mostly been positive and I've met much kinder, nicer, more caring addicts than I have people who are clean. This changed my perceptions of the world MASSIVELY, even before I was using heavy drugs myself and was just a weed smoker, I spent a lot of time with ""junkies"", heroin/crack smokers, I would often sit down with beggars and homeless people just to chat, give them some company, some spiritual energy and love and guidance, and these were always such lovely and happy moments (as I'm a user, I may be biased in saying that addicts are nicer than sober people, but I have had this opinion since before I was using). Most of the people in this world look down on addicts, won't associate or talk to addicts or give them the time of day, they think they're just dirty tramps, people look down on them, always, and think they are better than them just because they have a job and don't do drugs, and why? Most of the judgement is shallow, egotistical, judging by what they see, judging when they haven't even sat down and spoken to anyone, before they have even heard about their life story, what they've been through, who they are, where they're going, what they want and it's so wrong, I wish we could change societies view on this. Homeless people/addicts are seen as the worst of the worst, the bottom of the pile, and why? Because they don't really take care of themselves, have bad hygiene most times and a drug addiction? People put all homeless/addicts in the same box and it's wrong, someone who is clean, and has a good job, money, a house, dresses nice all the time but is a complete selfish, arsehole, and drinks three bottles of wine a night but says they're ""not an alcoholic"" will still think they are better than an addict and to me, this doesn't make sense. In my lifetime, I have met more nicer, better, caring, loving, giving and friendlier homeless/addicts than I have met ""normal"", working, drug free people. 

I had lost all faith in humanity, I was pretty much done after my mother kicked me out during the pandemic because she thought her boyfriend fancied me, and this was just after I had just come out of 5+ years of being domestically abused, losing my child, had no job, no home, no money and was in recovery and receiving mental health treatment, and after pretty much being abused or bullied or just treated like shit by pretty much everyone that had been in my life at some point, I was ready to end it, kill myself and be done as I learnt that most people these days are heartless and selfish, most people I met physically were horrible, most people I'd spoken to or had seen speaking to others on the internet were horrible, I had accepted that in this life, you'll experience more nasty, narcissistic, abusive, horrible people than ones who are genuinely loving and who genuinely care. Being homeless, I associated and mixed with other homeless people and drug addicts, I ended up getting into these drugs myself too, which opened me up to meet even more people, and even when I got off the streets eventually, I still associated and spent time with homeless people and other addicts, and honestly, getting into this lifestyle was the only thing that stopped me from killing myself because I finally met people who genuinely cared and were genuinely nice, nicer than anyone I had met, and like me, these people had been judged and looked down upon and abused and cast away by abusive, nasty, uncaring, ""I'm better than you because I don't do drugs and have a job"" people, and it's so messed up that we all, good, caring people, ended up with traumatic, awful lives, ended up on the streets and with addictions, while narcissistic, abusers, live in nice, big, warm homes with good jobs. I'm sometimes glad and grateful I ended up homeless and on drugs, because I've made connections and relationships with people who have given me more care and more love than anyone in my family or whole life ever has

5. When the buzz makes you feel super drowsy and relaxed and chilled out and you have the best bloody sleep ever and also really cool dreams. I've always kinda of preferred opiates and drugs (medical and recreational) that make you sleepy and drowsy, sleeping is one of my most favourite things to do, I love to sleep and to sleep as long as I can and hate waking up, but I also love the feeling of being tired and sleepy, when it gets to a certain point in my day, bam that's it, I want to feel incredibly sleepy and tired, I hate not feeling sleepy, especially before bed, the feeling of being tired is incredibly pleasurable and enjoyable, I wish I had stronger sleeping pills which I could take every night. Usually I end up taking all of my medications which make me drowsy way too soon and finishing them waaaay before I'm due my next prescription because I just crave that sleepy feeling so much. I love that feeling when you're so tired, that your eyes are literally looking in two seperate directions, when the screen starts to go blurry, when your head starts to drop and everytime you close your eyes, they're harder and harder to open.. when I have to actually try hard and make effort to keep my eyes open, and even then, my eyes still close anyway, that's when I'm satisfied, that's when I'm happy, that's when I'm tired enough, and I wish to feel like that every night. If there was medication or sleeping pills I could take to make myself feel that way every night, I'd probably end up giving up most of this stuff because feeling, ""I'm about to pass out"" kinda sleepy is my favourite feeling in the world..

I'm heavily addicted to: gambling, smoking (a pack of cigarettes + one juul pod a day), alcohol, various drugs (mostly weed and amphetamines), video games, social media (the internet in general), porn and jerking off and caffeine (i drink 2 cups of espresso + 3 to 4 energy drinks daily). 

I taught I had it under control, I really did but it is now clear that I don't.



Now I will give some details about my situation.

First of all I'm in my 20's and a high school dropout. Never even thought about going to college. I mean I wanted to, but there was no way to learn anything while being high all the time.

I don't have a job and I'm completely broke, and this has caused me to steal from and lie to people that I love the most. This makes me feel so guilty it's unberable.

A little over 4 years ago I said that I want to quit all this shit and start living a normal and fufilling life, but I can not remain sober for more than an hour.

But the worst thing is that I HAD A COMPLETELY NORMAL AND HAPPY LIFE BEFORE ALL THIS. My parents are great I had cool friends, I had a girlfriend and my school was going pretty good. But one day a friend of a friend offered me weed and I took it. Oh boy if i only knew where that was going to lead me I would have ran away so fast..



So please give me any advice you can I have already been to 6 different facilites and have been treated by the best proffesionals with absolutely no results. I also have full support from my family but that is not helping either.

I'm in a very deep hole and I'm only falling deeper.



I spent over 2 hours on this post and I have tried to make it as coherent as possible because I'm writing this under the influence and English is not my first language.",8,0

First off I wanna say how grateful I am for this subreddit and everyone here who shares in the terrible experience of addiction. I’m rooting for everyone here, cuz you guys are more than worth it.

I just had a question for those who have had extended periods of sobriety after long-term addiction. When I used over the last few years, music slowly and then quickly slipped from my mind and I found myself simply not giving a shit about listening or finding music. 

Currently I am 34 days sober from drugs, including alcohol. I was in a treatment facility for 28 days (best decision of my life without a doubt), and starting around halfway I began noticing myself reacting emotionally to music again. I could actually feel it again. This has only been progressing, and it honest to god feels like a revelation. 

Now in sober living I find myself spending lots of my free time just listening to anything, and the feelings are so intense… and it’s just left me in awe of how much addiction breaks you down. Your feelings, your interests and passions… I never comprehended how much my disease had stripped me of really feeling these things.

So, question for those recovering: have any experienced this sensation as they’ve progressed? How did it make you feel? By itself it instills optimism and hope that we can reconnect with ourselves whenever we stop.

So I first tried blow after work when drinking with the guys at our hotel cause we were out of town, boss and all the other guys were at a bar so there was only 3 of us drinking at the trucks. Out of the 3 of us 2 of them had some and I didn’t cause I had never done it, the guy 2 years older then me  ( I’m 20) took some out while the 3rd guy went to get more beer across the street. Poured it out of a baggie on to his phone and used the key card to make a big line and a tiny one for me, never had touched it at this point and was unsure but hey fuck it right, out of town getting hammered and no boss, so I took the tiny rip and thought it was alright nothing to special kept drinking smoked a few joints that night too. 

So 3rd guy gets back (he’s about 35) says he’s going to the room to put the beer in the fridge ,think nothing of it 5 mins later get a call to come up so naturally the 2 of us go up to his room and boom 3 lines probably 0.2 each. I looked and was unsure and so Was the other young guy but why the fuck not I ain’t going to be a bitch about it. They both do them and hand me the 20$ bill and I hit it and instantly throat numb and I can’t feel it nose goes numb too so I drank lots of water and was alright in 5 mins but that one is what got me hooked. 

We work road construction so we’re making a good amount of money not an issue so they had plenty. All fucking night didn’t sleep and cause no sleep did it all the next day too away from the rest of the crew. I didn’t buy any for the first month of doing it every couple days,( I always just worked alone with the 35 yo) so I started doing it everyday with him and he already did and I started buying every 3-4 days I’d get 2g and he always has minimum 3-4g on him so we always shared so it lasted longer then I started doing bigger and bigger lines with him and now 5 1/2 months later I try not to use daily and I don’t, probably 4/7 days but when I do I can do 2-3g in a night by myself over the course of 8-12 hours.

The money isn’t really the problem I’ve tried stopping but I just can’t family has history of abuse and I have adhd and an addictive personality so that does not help. I’ve reached out to my closest friends for help and they say they will be there and help me with this but the only time they act caring is when I bring it up, otherwise they don’t check on me and it kinda hurts, I need someone always there for me or I’m just going to do it again and not tell them.

Literally my best friend knows me inside and out , literally met him when I moved in g8 and we have never separated, he will be my best man and I’ll be his. It kinda hurts cause he pays almost no attention to me and all to his girlfriend so when I need help he’s alway to busy and I’m just so done being there for him and her cause we were all really close before they got together and they can’t make the time for me. It will always be love no matter what but I’m at the lowest I’ve been and need the help the most.

I’ve gone through a lot in my short 20 years and this is the time I need him most. Like I’ve tried to kill myself but that doesn’t compare to this addiction. 
(Not looking for pity for the attempt)
Just kinda lost 
Anybody got any words for me?

Essentially we are all coming off of either heroin or meth and are all pretty toxic people since we are suffering coming off drugs and coming off the streets, out of prison, etc. 

But I expect better because I wasn’t raised to treat women like shit. 

She calls me “nuthouse crazy”, says I have minions in my head, says girls that slit their wrists don’t do it right and do it for attention, makes fun of everyone here, plays power games, intimaidates everyone, is an all around bully, talks about drugs etc. 

I moved in with her when her roommate moved out, and prior to me moving in we were pretty close. 

Now that I’ve moved in with her I see her ugly side full on. 

I told her I’m moving back to my room because I had it alone and liked it because only 2 other women have a room by themselves and I don’t want to be stuck with her. 

And she got really upset, goes to length to avoid me, slams doors on me, and treats me like even more shit. She says I’m a snob and judgmental (she’s one to talk) and just overall treats me poor. 

I don’t have the best relationship skills (and abandonment issues) hince I turned to drugs. 

How do I deal with her living with her in the same house, her having a position of authority, and her confronting me and avoiding me?

I trauma bond without knowing it, so when people treat me bad I tend to cling to them and wonder what I did wrong.

Anyway I got back into it and have been trying hard to get out for a while now. I have the desire and I know I don’t want it anymore. I am so much happier and my life is 1000% better when I don’t take it and idk why I end up choosing to do it a week or two later but I do and then I hate it and then I stop and then the cycle just keeps going. Right now I’ve D/C my doc and connections. I am trying very hard to hold on to the feeling of feeling good without it- some “ roadblock” or I guess “ reasons “ I talk myself into it being a good idea is my completely insane work schedule as an RN. I work nights and have been picking up a lot- I am completely hating every second of it. It is hard for me to stay up at night cuz I actually prefer to be in bed by 9 PM. I had a good stretch of maybe a month or so w/out using and I loved going to bed w my kids at like 8-9 and waking up at 4 and going to the gym. I love the gym and it’s another reason why I don’t want to use out of so many bc when I use I can’t go to the gym and I neglect every aspect of my life except work so I can get thru it. If I don’t take it for  3-4 days I feel ok but for example last week I was feeling good getting ready for my 4 nights in a row preparing myself mentally and knowing I wasn’t going to seek out any - and then of course my connection hits me up and initial I said nope but then I talked myself into it being a good idea bc I have four nights ahead of me. I cut him off recently. I just don’t want to do it anymore/ the mood swings the Manic episodes the neglect the depression the ups and downs it’s just so exhausting. I’ve been making small steps but like when am I finally gonna be done and done for good ? Idk it’s so hard. I don’t trust myself and I’ve relapsed so many times it’s ridiculous. I’m looking into supplements like citicoline to help w my f’d dopamine production bc at this point it’s not even a craving but almost a need sometimes bc my brain is physiologically changed due to the constant interruptions in my normal dopamine levels. There is 100% a link between using and our bodies need to compensate for nutrients minerals neurotransmitters destroyed so that’s a big part of what I’m trying to balance out now because I do believe that sometimes it’s not even my desire to use cuz it’s def not at this point it’s the lack of essentials my body is missing to get thru the day. Anyway if anyone has suggestions on some good vitamins etc lmk. I take Wellbutrin and it does help but also I’ve read that it depletes production of citicoline which is one of the vital hormone needed to make dopamine. So now I’m conflicted - I’m waiting to hear back from my doc on this one cuz I don’t want to f up my dopamine receptors more and I do believe long term Wellbutrin does modulate how they respond to dopamine. Anyway. Just seeking something helpful on the nutritional side of it to help decrease the cravings. Thx !",1,0

So when I got into drug use around age 16, I was in a very depressed mental state. Why? Because I was convinced that I was physically ugly and that nobody would ever love me, so I saw no reason not to say ""fuck it"" and do a ton of drugs.

Well, I was a pretty lanky and nerdy looking teenager, and so in a way I was physically ugly back then, but around age 20 I put a lot of work into myself and I became more physically attractive over the next few years.

The thing is, placing importance on sexual attractiveness turned out to be another goddamn dopamine trap, just like pleasure unwoven talks about. I'm 24 now and I am so fucking lonely. I am trying to finish school but I can't stop doing drugs because I really see myself as pathetic and ugly in spite of getting attention from women irl. If I could somehow ""prove"" to myself that I'm actually attractive, then maybe this pain would stop. But I can't, because unless you're extremely good looking (which I'm not, just a bit above average), you have to put some effort into sexual relationships, which I'm too depressed to do

I have been ""ugly"" before due to being fat for a short time in the past (seroquel in rehab lol), so I know the difference between the two states of ""attractive"" and ""ugly"". In the ugly state I had zero confidence about my looks but at least people were somehow more friendly and laughed at my shitty self deprecating jokes. Nowadays, it's damn near impossible to filter between genuine affection and simple politeness, not to mention the rather threatened aura that some guys have towards me. 

One of my friends, who is quite physically attractive, seems to know that I have been using in secret. Or, at least, he seemed to understand my situation, insofar that when one is physically attractive, people are less likely to confront you about problematic behaviors and related shit; they just put up with it when you're around and then talk shit behind your back. It's not like I'm begging my higher power to make me wake up tomorrow with a deformity, but I don't think attractiveness is ultimately a benefit in life and it fucking kills me that my suicidality and BDD aren't taken seriously just because I'm already sooooo privileged.",7,0

Today I failed for the 11th time to stop my addiction . I have tried so many different ways to quit and with each fail it only makes me try harder. I am dedicated to quit and I won't stop trying. At this point you are probably wondering what addiction ... porn , yes a lot of people will think it's silly others may even believe that no such addiction exists but it very well does.


I started at a young age like most but it was never something I was ashamed of doing and it's something most people do anyway as it has become normalised. It was a multiple time a day habit that I enjoyed doing and as a kid it was quick and simple, the stuff I was watching was considered normal so I didn't feel too guilty afterwards. And at that age it really didn't bother me, it's not like I had anything better to do other than play PlayStation.


As the years went by the stuff I watched and the frequency stayed relatively the same , i might have even done it less at times. Now this is where the problem starts... so as I was growing up my interests changed and I got smarter meaning I started to figure out how to access other parts of the internet which lead to the things I was watching to become more extreme and over time I started getting into the really nasty stuff because regular porn just didn't make me feel anything anymore, even then I didn't look at it as something completely abnormal so it got even worse...

I figured out how to access the dark web and pretty much all the messed up places all over the internet. I won't go into detail the type of stuff that i watched but you can probably guess for yourself. At that point I slowed things down a little and went back to the slightly less messed up but still bad stuff I was watching but after some time even that messed up stuff I was watching wasn't good enough so I had to go back to those dark places in order to be satisfied. That's when I realised I have a problem.


The first attempt I made at quitting was accidental becuase I was too busy with some amazing videogames and movies so I completely forgot about porn which made me go 2 weeks without it which was my best attempt so far and the one I am trying to beat to this day. It was amazing I was at my happiest during those 2 weeks. But as all good things must come to an end I completed the videogames and watched all the movies so back to porn it was , i didn't look at the messed up stuff straight away but I very quickly got back into it


After I got to experience the benefits of staying away from porn for just 2 weeks I wanted to feel that happiness again so thats when I dedicated myself to quit it for good. 


Some of the attempts were honestly pathetic while some managed to last over a week. Even tho i did not manage to quit after each attempt the type of stuff i was watching became less messed up and because of the attempts I was only doing it once or twice per week on average. I only had a few major slip ups where I went back to the really bad stuff including today.


I have acknowledged the fact that i have a problem and I am doing everything I can to fix it. I have listened to podcasts and watched videos for tips on quitting , I have also read stories from people on reddit and other social media pages. I have installed countless apps which have helped me stay away from looking at it accidentally and one of the more extreme ways I have tried to quit is by punishing myself, every time I fail I take a cold shower and after every fail the time I have to stay in the shower increases. I know some people take cold showers daily but for me it's like torture although after so many fails I am starting to get used to it. Another form of punishment I have done is by restricting myself form social media or music that I like for a number of days. All those things have helped but its nowhere near enough to stop the demon inside of me from taking over. 


Speaking of demons it really feels like there is one living in my head. When I look at porn I don't even get much enjoyment out of it. I will try to describe this in the best way possible... When I am looking at porn my vision goes blurry and my Brian stops thinking.  I am looking at stuff I feel disgusted by but I just can't stop it , at times i will snap back to reality and try to put my phone down but I can never do it in time so it just takes back over me. And when is say i don't get much pleasure out of it what I mean by that is that it feels good for about the first 10seconds and then i won't feel pleasure anymore but at that point it's too late and I won't be able to stop until it's done. The first thought I get in my head when I get the urge is I'll just look at one image to help me do it without porn but i always end up going back down deep down into those dark places.


I have refrained from using the word masturbate becuase what I am mainly trying to quit is porn and not masturbation, of course it would be great If I could quit both at the same time but porn is the main problem. I have even tried masturbating without porn and i try to keep it as my trump card in my back pocket but I am never able to pull it out in time as my phone is already typing the letter p into Google before I even get the chance to use it.


Porn is holding me back as a person and my progress in life , there are hobbies I want to do and happy moments that I want to experience but my addiction keeps getting on the way


With all of that said I am proud of the progress that i have made, even after 11 fails I will keep trying to better myself and quit for good. I doubt anyone will take their time to read through this entire essay (sorry its so long) but if you did and have any tips or ideas to help me please leave a reply :)",5,0

I had a previous post however NOBODY really read what I wrote, they were all too quick to pass judgement and were not focusing on the big picture.  


So I’m posting again and asking that you read EVERYTHING I WROTE BEFORE YOU RESPOND 


This is a very serious question… Please focus on the situation and not your opinions on the person. This is a very serious situation I need advice on

I am helping a 28-year-old girl whom we shall call ANN for privacy purposes try to get her life on track. She’s a good person, but just like everyone she has her faults.  Hers happens to be a drug dependency on opiates.  

Ann’s family scenario is a bit dysfunctional.  She is the youngest out of six brothers and sisters…4 are what we would call “normies” no drug dependency’s …. and 1 has been sober 1 year.  

Her parents are divorced and she really has no relationship with her father… Just her mother, whom has a plethora of illnesses… Including extreme OCD (everything has to be spotless and in order and she’s a germ-a-phobe).  

Ann speaks to & texts her mother on the phone several times each day.  Her mother will ONLY speak to her on the phone, she will NOT physically see Ann unless Ann is “sober“. 

Meaning…. Her mother won’t see her today because she is on drugs….. however if Ann went to rehab tomorrow her mother will go and see her. It really upsets this young lady that her mother will not see her, she is heartbroken over it yet she continues to talk to her mother on the phone every day and text back and forth a zillion times.  She tells her mother everything.  

Thanksgiving is next week and this girl wants nothing more than to go to Thanksgiving dinner… However she is NOT invited. I sat in on a three-way FaceTime call and Ann asked her mother if she could please go to Thanksgiving dinner and her mother told her “ABSOLUTELY NOT”  because she is on drugs. If she was sober… she would be allowed to go.   This young lady argued with her mother and said “I could just lie to you and say I am sober and you would never know… So what’s the difference? It’s not like I am going to be doing anything in front of you guys” 

I did not want to include my opinion on this situation however after much deliberation I’ve changed my mind.  I want people whom are especially closed minded to see the whole picture and think about things they may not have normally thought about. 

Personally, I agree with Ann… and my whole thing is this: as long as whatever she is doing is not negatively affecting anyone else or getting in the way of anything what’s the problem??? Drug addiction is NOT contagious.  Ann is still the same person whether she says she is sober or on drugs…. And as long as she does not do the drugs infront of anyone what the heck is the problem??? 

I’m sorry but I have a very hard time with this and it’s breaking my heart.  I think it’s bullsh^t. Her mother told her she could face time into thanksgiving dinner and Ann said “Hell NO!” and then said to her mother “oh that’s nice….so I can see you all together having a good time without me, no thanks” her mother disagreed and said FaceTiming was just as good.  Sorry but I agree with Ann.  I feel that’s like a slap in the face and more hurtful.

Ann’s mother then tried to say it was not her call on whether Ann could come or not because Ann’s older sister is hosting the dinner.  Her mother said she should call her older sister and ask if she could go but doesn’t think the sister will say yes.  Personally, if it was my family, I would not have to call my sibling and ask because my mother would be fighting it on my behalf and would probably say that if I wasnt invited she would not attend either.  I think it’s just a cop out for Ann’s mother.  I’m sorry but I just don’t get it and I think it’s terrible.  



I also have a difficult time with the fact that Ann’s mother won’t physically see her but will talk to her on the phone a hundred times per day.  I heard her mother admit that if Ann went to rehab tomorrow she would go see her.  My thoughts are this:  If your talking to her anyways why does she have to be in rehab for you to physically see her? Personally, if it were me, I wouldn’t even be speaking to my mother on the phone if that’s what was going on.   


Please share your thoughts on all this.  I’d especially like to know if you think Ann should be invited to thanksgiving dinner with the rest of the family.",3,0

Soft Drugs 5:
1. The unique anger and frustration you get when you don't have weed
2. Making stupid/regrettable decisions that you would never make sober
3. Smoking weed with people/a person you like, but then completely disliking them after being around them when you're stoned and you can't go back to how you felt when you first liked them as you are now permanently put off, annoyed and weirded out by all the things that bothered you about them when you were high. I have stopped being friends with people and ended relationships because of this.. many times as well
4. Ending up broke, not because you spent all your money on weed/booze, but because you wasted all of your money on munch/sweets/food or buying unnecessary crap that you don't need online
5. Not wanting to get out of bed after smoking a lot of weed or drinking a lot the night before

Hard drugs 5:

1. Letting yourself go and completely neglecting yourself and your hygiene, like wearing the same clothes all week, not having a shower or a wash for ages, not brushing your teeth or hair, not wearing make up or nice clothes anymore, not going to the hairdresser's etc.. mostly because 1. You can't be bothered anymore and 2. You just don't care anymore or see the point in these things which feel futile
2. Always having dirt under your nails, black fingers, all of your skin torn up and ripped off your thumbs and index fingers from gauze/steel wool and then continuing to rip your skin on your thumb/finger because you excessively chew them when you're waiting for gear or dont have anything at all.
3. Wishing you could waste your money on shit you don't need and buying lots of nice food and sweets, but never having any money cos you spent everything on the gear/smoke
4. All of your ""friends"" and people you associate with now are two faced, fake, users, liars, scammers, people who would happily stab you for a couple of hits and not having any real friends to rely on or turn to
5. Losing all want and/or confidence for anything sexual, romantic or affectionate. You could literally watch hours of porn, be touched intimately, get naked with someone and you would still be as dry as your mouth when you smoke weed or as limp as frozen pizza which has defrosted

I am a female and I am addicted to self pleasure, self love, however you want to call it. And it is slowly eating me up. 
I have had one partner in my life with whom I am no longer and like in the middle of the relationship it started. He was about as hooked on self love as I am now but I am pretty sure I am worse now than he has ever been.

It is not affecting my social life or my uni work or anything. It is just affecting my bed time. It doesn't technically affect my relationship since I don't have a partner in my life due to other reasons. 

I tried talking to a doctor about this but it wasn't really helpful and I'm currently in no position to go to therapy. 

As I said, my life doesn't suffer under this. I think I just want to have someone who can relate. Preferably also without a relationship since I wouldn't be able to try and incorporate techniques used by people with a partner. But no matter what and who, I'm here for it.

Like the mucus filled coughs filled with blood- gasping in-between for air, killing myself slowly, painfully, knowingly. 
..still not caring.

That's as close to describing this city as I can get. 

A waste, a disgust, a place where God took a shit and the worst morphed into this broken city full of misplaced people and abused souls. Riddled with substance abuse issues, anger and malt liquor at ripe hours of the morning. 

Scattered along the cracks in the sidewalks lay the dirty needles, broken bottles and twisted stares by passer bys. 

We were always endlessly waiting for the liquor store to open, my friend uncontrollably shaking. Me up for 3 days on amphetamines...this was just the way it was. This was my new normal, reality was just a place I didn't want to ever be. 
Misery had finally found her company...

The mentally ill reside here in mass quantities, coping with these things just to merely get through each pathetic day. 

The sun doesn't even shine here.

 Each day seems like more of a waste than the first. No hope lives here, in the shadows of the beast. 
In this slum land fuming with toxic waste.

Empty eyes. Sunken cheeks. Emaciated. Stumbling by trapped inside in a waking nightmare. 
Strung out, spun out, drunk- daily. 
Let's get fucked up and die, a motto the city projects. 

Escape the town, escape the hell. Back I go for more every time. For what? For fucking what? 

That city swallowed me. In one fucking bite I became a part of this towns mutations, another statistic. 

Almost 2 years had passed before I woke up. 
2 years before I got out of that city, that endless cycle, those circles, that smelly fucking trash bag I was suffocating in for longer than I care to admit. 
 
It was all my fault, from start to finish. 
Cos when I think about my time in that city, I remember the time before was no different.

How did a decade pass without me even realizing it? 

Whatever remnants I have left inside myself l I've puzzled back together.

How do I stop this? I find myself always whipping out my phone whenever I’m somewhat vacant, to flip through the same 4 apps that I might have notifications on. I pointlessly text people about nothingness. I look at posts that mean nothing and contribute nothing to my life yet they give my stupid monkey brain the tiniest shred of dopamine that somehow keeps me opening my devices time and time again. 

I’ve noticed my best mental health days are when I’ve been so busy with things in my life that I don’t have the chance to go on my phone. It’s so, so, SO hard to break this habit. I’ve tried so hard. I set time limits on my phone but that doesn’t work I just click past them. One more minute. 15 more minutes. If I had a hard lock I’d find a way around it because I’m ADDICTED.

I am hoping someone who has been and has been around an addict can help me understand. 

I just saw a post from someone who was celebrating 25 years clean, and while reading others share they were months or years clean as well, I felt happy for them, but I also got this surge of sadness, anger and envy because my mom never really tried. She would only clean up for short periods when she would get injuries from being intoxicated. I think it was more because she was scared that her freedom to live alone would get taken away because when that stuff would happen, people would be all up in her biz. Never to be a better mom, or to live a better life and push herself to accomplish something. It seemed like she would acknowledge being an addict just because that’s what other people wanted to hear. She went to AA meetings when a court would require it. She was so intelligent and understood so much about the human condition, but she was never able to view herself with the insight she had towards others and life in general. 

I hear of stories of people who spiraled equally as much as her or worse, who pulled themselves out. Is there something that seems to make a difference? She’s gone now so it’s not like anything can change, but  I would still like to understand her better for my own healing.",3,0

He has been clean for 2 years now from heroin, and seems to be doing well every time we talk. He still smokes, drinks, and does pot that I am aware of, although he has been cutting back on the drinking since getting chronic pancreatitis. He is a big fan of festivals, but now goes with my other siblings who like festivals as well and as far as I know stays clear of ""hard"" drugs. I'm unsure if he does anything else at these festivals, but it is a possibility. I know he's done shrooms, LSD type things in the past. 

He's always been interested in psychology, psychedelics, and the chemistry behind them. I'm unsure if it would be a good idea to get him books about the Science of Psychedelics, or stories about people's experiences.

For example, I have read a number of books by Michael Pollan and enjoyed them. He has a book ""How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence"" 

I don't want to encourage him towards using drugs, but if he's interested in the science I don't mind encouraging that. Opinions?",1,0

Nothing hard, but over the years, there's been: alcohol, weed, benzodiazepines and now daily kratom with valium at bedtime. He uses Kratom daily to get through the day (in a new tougher position) at work. He seems to adds a dose either due to a bad day, and to feel good at weekends.

He says (to me) that he wants to stop and be clean, but I'm not sure he either can or does want to. He attends a substance abuse support group (when it's not cancelled!) and has therapy. 

He cites his Dad's death as the catalyst for the Kratom addiction, but to be honest he's been using stuff on and off for long before that. He once ended up hospitalised due to taking a bad combo (this was at home with me and the kids).

I try and support my husband's and understand the trauma behind his problems. I support when he makes the right choices and show enthusiasm for all his positive action when it comes. But his problem is incredibly triggering for me. For context - I have a sister who died from substance abuse. I suffer from anxiety and depression myself. We have young kids, and I don't feel he should be getting in altered states in front of the kids. 

Sometimes i feel like I am being gaslighted, when he tells me I just need to be supportive and shouldn't take his drug use personally. Last night I was upset - he'd got high after I'd treated him to an extra special birthday weekend and time together. He couldn't understand why I was hurt and said I shouldn't be. But I AM hurt. Time after time. My mental health is getting pretty bad recently from going round in mental loops.  He then asked if I'd rather he just went back to drinking. Like that's my choice to make?! 

I love him very much. He's the father (a good father) to our children. But I just don't think I can take this any more. Lt alone the years and years ahead of this rollercoaster of confusion, hurt and resentment.

My husband of over 15 years relapsed 4 years ago. When we met he told me he was a recovering addict so I knew going into the relationship. 

The past 4 years have been horrible. His personality has changed, his addiction is worse, and he has now had an affair. I decided to try to reconcile, but I am struggling. 

His attitude about everything is so bad, I don't understand. He actively uses on average 3-4 days a week. 

I guess I am seeking insight on how the drugs might be affecting his attitude, his choice to have an affair, he acts like all of this is no big deal, paranoid, accusations against me for all kinds of things. He won't go to in patient rehab. 

I am at the end of my rope. How do you help someone that is stuck in this mindset? Do drug addictions really screw your head up so bad that you don't care about things anymore, like having an affair?

I’ll try and make this short. So I have two brothers, 23 and 19. I’m 25 and a female. We grew up with our parents who were loving but who fought a ton in front of us and were very emotionally immature, yelling in front of us and terrible with finances. They got divorced when I was 21, so I was in college. My little brother who I am talking about was 14 at the time. He had to suffer the divorce while at home living with them. He has always been loud and has a huge personality but is also sneaky and can be manipulative. But he has a huge heart. We have a good relationship. I felt like I always had to protect my brothers from the way my parents were acting. He started smoking weed and dabbling in drugs in high school, took some different stuff. He had behavior problems in high school. He had to go to a behavioral camp for a month in the summer his senior year of high school because he was acting out so badly and disobeying/being rebellious.

He started college in august and got into drugs, but he was doing them a lot more. Cocaine, taking pills (roxys), shrooms. Lots of coke he said. I found out later that when he called me panicking it was bc he was coming down from coke the next day. I’m really bad with street names for pills so forgive me if roxys isn’t correct. He would call me panicking because he needed to come home saying he needed help. This was only a handful of times but makes sense now. He was doing what his friends were doing but he cannot control himself at all. He is very impulsive and can’t stop himself. He came home in October because he needed to get treatment. He started outpatient with this program and everything seemed good for about a month/ 3-4 weeks but today he was acting funny and my mom made the outpatient team give him a drug test and he failed. He was planning on going back to college in January but he couldn’t resist taking a pill. He called me saying he screwed up and flushed it after he took one and wouldn’t do it again. He was so upset saying he was scared and that he was so happy and he made a mistake and he wouldn’t do it again.

TL;DR My problem I need help with is this: I feel so attached to the situation. I feel like I need to fix it. I’ve always felt like I needed to protect my brothers. I don’t know what I should do. I’ve always tried to help and have always been there for him but I’m really scared. I’ve been in denial that my brother is an addict. I am scared I will be attending my brothers funeral soon if he doesn’t stop. Can someone relate or give me any advice? I love him so much like my family is everything to me and he is my baby brother.

Or how can he help himself?,"He's 33 and in Georgia, a good friend but has had always had a difficult life and has not made the best decisions. I moved away to Seattle some years back so I'm unable to help in person, but I hang out rather frequently with him online still.

He's been an alcoholic for maybe 7 years, and he's smoked cigarettes since late middle school. He drinks roughly 7 beers a day. He's tried to quit everything multiple times -- swapping to vaping, trying to swap to marijuana, but stopping smoking and alcohol abuse has all been unsuccessful. He lives with his mother and older brother at the moment, who constantly fight. The stress of this fighting is a constant trigger for escapism and alcohol use. He doesn't have a GED (he's considered working on getting that in the past), so viable employment elsewhere and moving out is difficult.

And recently his health has begun to fail.

He can't sleep (how he usually sleeps) on his stomach without feeling the need to vomit. His extremities retain fluid that shouldn't be there. He has copious amounts of phlegm almost constantly from anything he does -- when he eats, smokes a cigarette, and even waking up he feels a need to hack something up. Sometimes his hands randomly itch, and once scratched they swell up. Sometimes he blows his nose and there's blood (perhaps dryness). He now also suffers from depression and severe anxiety. He's not sure if he's had COVID - but the timeframe also lines up. He's over 350 lbs. now and diabetes is a concern.

For years I've certainly tried to convince him that one day he'll have a ""day of reckoning"" where the problems he's had he can't ignore any longer. These conversations have gone deep, but I'm sure as you can all relate addiction is a cruel beast. He knows all of these problems are largely a consequence of his own actions and there are many demotivating factors. But possibly the most difficult part of this has been that it's been easier to ignore these problems for all these years until now.

We've just had a pretty deep chat, and I think today for the first time in months he's open to change out of desperation. At this point I've advised him:

* He absolutely should see a doctor. Tangentially related he's not vaccinated -- he's open to the idea but it's been more an issue of being anxious in public places versus not wanting the vaccine.
* He should call the national help hotline for drug abuse (I found this when Googling)
* He should look into disability. He currently has been surviving on savings from when he did work, but he's been unemployed for almost a year now.
* He needs to move out of his toxic environment (difficult -- understood).

But what can he do?

* He's concerned about going to a doctor because he doesn't have money, has no employment, and maybe $2500 to his name.
* He's interested in some kind of rehab. How that could happen is unknown with his resources.
* What hope could he have for some kind of long-term plan? This may be putting the cart before the horse though with these problems he needs to solve immediately.
* Are there any recommended resources he can take advantage of? Can he apply for something like Medicaid? Is there anything within reason that I can contribute? Could he qualify for disability -- how could he go about something like that?",4,2

Reading and watching testimonies of various drugs, specifically Xanax and adderall (only ones I can relate to), paints a picture of doing it once and getting hooked or dependent. However in my experience I can ‘enjoy’ the substance (all it does is lie to you) and forget about it the next day, granted while doing adderall I think about getting more but I can recognize that this is the drug talking. On the other hand, porn or sugar seems to be way harder to do away with even though they clearly aren’t as intense. Are some people resistant to becoming addicted to more ‘pure’ drugs while being susceptible to ‘common’ drugs like sugar or dopamine hits from PMO?

161,2021-11-20 07:47:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/qy4wqt/cocacola_adicction/,Coca-Cola Adicction,"I feel a bit dumb making this thread and comparing something this soft to much worse addictions like alcohol or hard drugs, but I don't have anyone to talk with about this and I'm feeling a bit stressed about a lot of things that happened to me this month and need some sort of feedback about my situation just in case some other experienced the same.

As far as I remember I was a Coca-Cola(the original caffeine one, no diet or zero never liked them) or carbonated drinks addict, I like all of them, I never drank alcohol or took drugs so it was my little ''satisfaction''. I probably started drinking it around age 10, since I have low blood pressure the carbonated drinks helped me a lot to endure high temperatures (my country have very high temperatures in summer), so from that I jumped to keep drinking each time even more. I have memories to drinking around 2L each day, now I'm 27yo, and from some years ago I lowered the amount to 2-3 cans a day (330ml) and started drinking a lot of water.

Now the problem comes around 4-5 weeks ago, I couldn't sleep one night with some twitching on my legs, I thought it was the Coca-Cola so I stopped drinking it, the problem continued and I actually had an urine infection, but since I started the path to stop drinking it I continued to not drink it again. I didn't reduce the amount each week or day, I literally stopped drinking all of it, on these 4-5 weeks I have only drank 2 cans in total; 1 on halloween and another day close to it for a pizza with friends.Aside from a lot of coca-cola, my food diet is very balanced and I'm fully healthy since I did a blood-test and urine test when I went to the doctor that told me about the urine infection.  Worst thing is 1 week after I stopped my medication from the urine-infection got a light stomach flu, had diarrhea for one night and after that had to do a bland diet to recover, so that stressed me even more about my situation, since my detox from coca-cola made me feel obssesed and anxious for things I never even worried, I never had anxiety on my life.

Since I started my detox from coca-cola, I feel a lot of distractions each day, can't be focused for hours on anything even on my hobbies, sometimes I get a bit anxious but thankfully it doesn't last much, dizzines and I feel my body trembling a bit like very agitated or excited. The anxiousness was much worse at the start, just like the trembling, now I get it randomly each day or no days at all. First weeks I woke up everytime feeling tired and with a lot of yawns, but now when I wake-up feel restless and well. I can also sleep all the night without waking up aside from sometimes going to the bathroom to pee one time each night. I don't know if I can call it depression, but I was a very rational and optimistic person before, and since I stopped drinking it I feel obssesed and pessimistic about any events that happens to me.

Sorry about my english, I tried the best I could, I'm starting to feel better each day, but still a bit annoyed about the bit of anxiety and dizziness.

Edit: Added that I never drank alcohol, consumed hard drugs or smoke.",8,3

For me, M(22), who’s overcome the grips of xanax addiction, I have done my fair share of fucked up shit. 
I have lied, betrayed, back stabbed, manipulated, and recklessly hurt those who cared deeply for me. It is something I live with every day, and am cognizant of all the time. 

I am over 1.5 years clean from xanax, but sobriety only highlights mistakes in addiction. Sobriety has made me feel empty… I’ve lost… so… many…. friends… because of the decisions I’ve made. I know that most likely those who have cut me out of their life, are doing better. 

I feel like I am the secret monster no one wants to be associated with. I feel like I hold others back, and negatively affect those around me. 
I feel like I lie to myself everyday about trying to be a better person. I feel like i’m a fucking shit human being no matter how much i’d like to think i’m not. It is ingrained who I am, I am naturally a horrible person. I have hurt those who only had good intentions. The people who wanted to help me… I took those people for granted…. fuck….

This is really hard. I have little to no hope for myself. You can only call the hotline so many times before you know the routine and it just doesn’t feel the same anymore. 

I can barely live with myself. I hate who I am, honestly, and I’m too embarrassed to tell the few people I have left. 

How could I take more responsibility for my actions? How do I gauge responsibility so that I don’t feel this weight all the time? Do I have to feel this weight? 
Can someone reassure me? How can I be proud of myself?

I never thought I’d be where I’m at right now. But no time to be happy yet. Now, I messed up again with my adderall. I’ve been having a family member lock it in a safe and give me my 30 mg xr every morning at 6:30am. I don’t feel it, but I can’t do anything without it. This has been going on for almost 6 months. Last week my grandfather died, and my family members each individually reached out to me to be there for them for support. I was scared myself, but I had fo be there for them. I was so glad they asked me, and I wanted to be there. Since I never felt the adderall, I thought it was a placebo. I figured my doctor obviously had my medication history and knew I abused tf out of everything including adderall in the past and wasn’t an idiot. So it had to be fake. So I took almost 17 pills in only a couple days. I didn’t feel anything! So I knew it was fake right? So I called the doctors office and told them what I did. And how worried I was. The next day I met with my psychologist and he said that my psychiatrist had dropped me. That’s it. No more adderall. He didn’t even have a plan to wean me off. And they said it is definitely real, not a placebo. They said it was enough to overdose. What is going on? Please tell me what you think is going on here. I have 5 pills left with no instruction. I plan to take one a day like I was before. It’s only 30 mg xr so will the withdrawal me that bad when I run out? Also why did I think it was a placebo? Is that pure insanity?",6,0

Like for me, I honestly don't feel I'm even an addict in the commonly understood definition. When I'm in any other environment, I don't crave things for anything other than the occasional good time, or microdoses in a healthy supplementation of various things. Where I am currently, all I can think about is escaping and numbing out. My location is ghetto and very near an area where some really bad things happened to me, I'm hungry all the time and can barely keep weight because of an odd food situation, I've struggled to find work despite being overqualified for nearly every place I've applied to. Something about this place is causing a self fueling cycle of ""life sucks I want to go numb"" and then ""I'm numb, I can't focus on making money to get a better life."" How do you break this cycle without having a hand up or a ladder out?

Is on the attack
Tried to kill him, he always comes back
Haunting my dreams, won't cut me some slack

The relentless friend
A demon I always contend
If I stop fighting, he will be my end
My sanity and my life he seeks to rend

He lurks in the corners of my mind
Until I can no longer keep him confined
A way out of this hell, I can't seem to find
No matter what I do, we remain intertwined

He's a part of me I used to embrace
Always used to put a smile on my face
But today I fight to stay away from that place
I don't want to go on living as a disgrace

I knew the bf better than the gf and when he asked me about possibly renting the space, I was really apprehensive about it as they have had a ton of drama and rehab bouncing, arrests for DUIs, domestic disturbances, etc related to their alcohol and opiate addiction. We reluctantly agreed on the condition that any drugs or excessive alcohol would immediately be the end of the subletting. Long story short, my bf and I had noticed a drastic change in the behavior of the bf. Abrupt, moody, withdrawn. Gf confided that she had been getting the rent money from her family although the bf was the one working, his money was being spent on alcohol. We've already been thru a domestic at 3am and should have terminated things then, but recently we found chore boy stashed in the hallway wrapped in a bed sheet covered in idk what sort of brown yuck and another generic kind of chore boy with one sponge missing (it was never in the kitchen or bathroom) and the other sponge was ripped.

I told myself I could and it would be easy. I started smoke when I was 16 to deal with the trauma of my childhood. And I have smoked almost every day for 14 years with a couple of breaks in-between. Probably 12 years all together. At this rate, if I keep on smoking, I will have been high for more of my life than I have been sober. 

I always told myself it would be easy to quite. That I wasn't addicted/dependent on it. Well, that was obviously wrong. Because it took me weeks of telling myself that the first thing in the morning I did would not be to immediately get high. Finally, 2 days ago I did it. And I'm going to try and ride this into a pot free lifestyle.

I know this isn't a hard drug, but the withdrawals are rough right now. Especially as I have multiple deadlines coming up at both work and school. I'm honestly am not sure how I've maintained success at both considering I'm constantly high. But now I'm trying to meet these deadlines with a fuzzy head. I'm very irritable, and I'm trying my hardest not to lash out at my fiance. I'm not sure how long this irritability will last, but this is my final indication that I smoke too much pot. I'm not craving smoking, but I am craving not feeling this way. 

At this point, Im just hoping I can push through all the deadlines, so that I can continue to heal. I once quite Adderall after being prescribed it for 18 years. So I know I can do this. I just need to remain strong.",8,0

I was skeptical at first cause I am not a fan of him, but other than the fact that it is, indeed, a great novel, you simply must read it for this character whom by the end of the book is so balls deep into his compulsion to use at every and ANY situation, and at ANY cost, that the end result is a mix of an all-too-familiar dark comedy, *and* great pain. It is just an extremely realistic depiction, especially the part towards the very end, as I said. Also the ever so necessary of coke binging gone shitty (literally) which was another piece of truth in the previous season of Succession. 

It has SOMEWHAT of a feel of the halfway house parts in ""Infinite Jest"", but, I mean, clearly nobody could ever top that. Interesting fact, though; I read in the DFW sub that people wonder whether Perry is inspired by Franzen's relationship with Wallace.

According to him he doesn’t find it helpful to discuss it much with family and friends and he said in the NA they even say it’s not always good to discuss their status often with loved ones, that often much of it is easier to discuss in group and leave it mostly there, essentially keeping a divide both physically and emotionally.

i have been doing a lot of drugs and i have an eating disorder. it’s kind of wild… i’m binging and purging 2x a day, which honestly doesn’t bother me much. i’ve been going through a weird kind of drug renaissance since i’ve entered college and doing a bunch of stuff, especially benzos and opiates. it isn’t an insane habit but i’m consuming some kind of drug pretty much every day, usually weed. i blew a lot of money stupidly, especially on binge food, but during the winter break i’ll work and i’ve learned my lesson about stupidly spending on that kind of bullshit. i stopped keeping any kind of food in my dorm since i know i’ll binge on it, which kind of sucks, but whatever.

i’ve had a history of suicidal thoughts and attempts (i’m not suicidal now) and my abusive dickwad brother tried to kill himself a month ago and i’ve been expected to play The Hero and help him. i don’t want him to die but i feel like it’s the most recent incident in my life that hammered in once again that my feelings don’t matter and i need to shut up and do what everyone demands i do. i’ve felt this way my whole life, i’ve always been bullied, outcasted, irrelevant…

and don’t get me wrong i have it *really good.* i love my parents and my family outside of my brother, i have a good friend system, i’m getting into a sort of romantic thing with a guy for the first time, i’m in honors and pulling in good grades. it’s going really well, all things considered. but the drugs and bulimia are my dirty secrets. my parents know i drink and smoke but don’t mind because i’m an 18-year-old college kid and it’d be weirder if i *didn’t* party. if they found out about everything else, they’d be so disappointed. they don’t know about the bulimia either, i’ve had it since i was 12 and recently i lost a ton of weight (i was obese) and they seem so proud and i know they’d be so upset if they knew the truth. even my therapist doesn’t know. i don’t think i could ever truly be honest with any of them. if they knew, they’d all be upset with me and i won’t be able to handle it.

but beyond that i’m not interested in getting better. i’m not suicidal but i don’t care much for living, i never really have. i have days where it’s really bad but i always suck it up and i usually don’t mind. i’ve been depressed since i was a kid and it’s just my normal to hate myself and feel tired all the time. it’s always been like this so i don’t see a reason to change, especially if addiction and depression are lifelong things – how can i be expected to put any effort in such a great struggle if it is destined to be in vain?

i don’t know the point of this. wanted it off my chest i guess. winter break is soon and it’ll be good for me to have time away from everything but weed and booze, i think. if you read all of this… why? but anyways. i hope you all take care of yourselves especially with the holidays. Love. <3",5,0

Not sure what to do.,"My husband has been in rehab/detox for a little over two weeks for alcohol. He’s set to come home next week and start an outpatient program. I was cautiously optimistic when he first started this process that he would just go through the motions, say and do all the right things only to get out and go back to some of the same old behaviors. As I’ve checked on him throughout this process, he has seemed to be doing really great — he’s seemed committed, like he’s working the program and I’ve been hopeful.

Meanwhile, I’ve been spending these entire last couple weeks focused on what I can do to make his return home comfortable and encouraging of his recovery. I’ve been working on getting areas of the house in order that had become a mess with his drinking, writing him a letter every single day to encourage him while in recovery, calling his facility daily to see how he’s doing (because he said that really helped him). I know I should have been using this time to focus on me, but doing these things also brought me joy and comfort.

Last night when he called I was with my mother-in-law and when I passed the phone to her I could hear that he was asking her to call his doctors office and get his pain medication (Norco) refilled. She didn’t come clean about it until I confronted her about it later on (she has a looooong history of enabling him…giving him Ambien, Xanax and even extra pain meds over the years when he’s asked for it). We had discussed before he went into treatment that his pain medication was a trigger for his drinking — he would go through a months worth of pills in about a week and then when he was out he would turn to alcohol to get his fix.

Where I was hopeful that when he comes home next week he’ll continue his recovery…that hope is now destroyed. At this point I’m at a loss for what to do — do I share this with his case manager in rehab? Contact his prescribing physician?

I (M18), started using drugs recreational 2 Years ago. Back then I wasn't realy interested in ""illegal"" drugs, so I mostly gravitated to pills (Mainly DXM) and Alcohol. I still had my drug consumption under control during that time, I was still going to school regularly, getting good grades even, aswell as interacting socially with the people around me. But after a while I got bored of the drugs I had access too, or more there effects I should say. I started smoking weed and my 2nd relationship introduced me to Mdma, wich lead to acid, wich lead to ketamin. Now I barley go to school, barley have the strength to get out of bed and barley see a will to life. My whole life is going down hill and I feel like I can't stop it. I've lost all my friends and people I appreciate the most and it seems like I can't or won't learn from my mistakes. Ive been diagnosed with depression when I was 15 and I even lost my therapist since there is a law in my country which forbids them to treat people as long as there is psycho-active substances involved.

     The way I feel at night haunts me. I can't get out of my head or my thoughts. If I could scream at the top of my lungs I would. I'm scared of everything around me, down to not trusting anyone or even trusting myself. The thing I'm scared the most of is being left with these terrifying thoughts. after multiple suicide attempts, I know it's best for me to go to rehab, but what happens when my demons come with me? What happens when I wake up in an unfamiliar bed and question everything I've ever known? I know I have the strength within me but will I when the time comes? Will I just break down? I feel like I'm more than an alcoholic. I feel like I have something wrong with me inside my brain and all I can do is try to get out of it. The only way to do that is alcohol or other unhealthy coping mechanisms such as false validation, toxic relationships, and making people laugh. None of these things have longevity or are sustainable. Like I said I am going to rehab and I am proud of it, it just doesn't counter-act the fear I have with having everything I've ever known completely change. I KNOW that I will be a better person after the choice that I made to go to rehab, but a bigger part of me than I'd like to admit doesn't want to let go of so many negative things of my life. That being said I am in the process of figuring out why I have made the choices that I have made over and over just to see the same outcome (if not worse) in different lights. I truly am not looking for any sympathy or even necessarily advice (although I'm always open to advice) I would just to not feel like a fucking maniac seeing demons everytime I close my eyes and feel regret everytime I open them. I would like to see if I'm not the only one that sleeps for 6 hours and lives for 3 weeks in her dreams for one night, in a whole different life. I know I sound crazy and maybe I am. But I would be so GRATEFUL to find people that feel even close to the way I've been feeling, because I don't want to feel alone anymore and I don't think anyone else deserves to either",2,0

I have jitters and shivers randomly, It is hard to stand still. I have heart burn and acid reflux, it feels like my lungs and my heart are finally adjusting without the nicotine. My appetite has decreased and I have been more moody, upset, and just very tired. It is so hard to be strong because this is mainly all an psychological battle.

It started when my mother started getting painkillers for her cancer, I honestly didn’t know you could become addicted to pills at that age. I mean it’s literally medicine, how bad could it possibly be? My mother progressively got worse, but the medicine they gave her got stronger. When she died, I had over 2000 various opioid medication left over. I would find myself on the floor most nights, passing out in school, and consistently high on drugs. When I was 17, I decided to stop before I developed a real problem, i had been 3 days clean before my brother introduced me to meth. Fast forward to when I was 19, I lost 68 pounds in a year. I spent hundreds of dollars weekly online using a tor browser to get fentanyl that was pressed to resemble Percocet 30. I knew it was laced and I bought them for that exact reason. A couple of my buddies fell into it with me, so when I got my packages, I would sell to them too. None of us are above 21 years old. And now for a confession that’s been weighing me down like an anvil. Shit got easier, we acquired multiple assault rifles and we were paranoid. I’ve never shot anyone, but I did take someone’s life. Me and my buddy were hanging out when a kid I knew from highschool came over. He doesn’t do drugs too often but I’ve known him to buy from us. He was a good kid, 18 years old, went to church… I sold him 3 fentanyl laced roxycodone 30mg. The same night, his sister found him dead, he died in his sleep, fentanyl overdose. That brings us to today, at this point it’s only been a month or so since he passed. Everyday is torture, I often find myself with a glock in my mouth. I got fired from my job. I can’t do this anymore. I need help. I’m 20 years old, and it feels like I’m missing 5 years of my life. Truthfully I’m terrified. I’m numb.",15,0
205,2021-11-16 18:04:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/qvkqjv/alcoholism_my_experience/,Alcoholism. My experience,"Disclaimer and trigger warning: Don’t take this post personally, I just needed to find a place somewhere where I could openly talk about this and not be judged/shamed for it. I don’t want this to be a post that makes people think that drinking this much is okay because it really isn’t. 

How much I drink: 

I drink on average about 4 beers a day. I could easily kill at most a 12 pack on an off day. I’ve had days where I didn’t drink at all and those days I was in situations where I didn’t feel like I had to escape anything. I’d consider myself a functional alcoholic.

I’m an alcoholic but I’m not ashamed of it: 

I hide my alcoholism really well when it comes to showing up to my life and I have a good grip on not letting the booze take away from my living expenses and social life. For example, I never drink when I am going to work and if someone needs my presence and support, I drink very little when I need to be there for them. I love caring for others and it gives my life meaning. When I am alone and have nothing better to do, I start to drink like there is no tomorrow. I don’t like existing and drinking kind of helps with my feelings of existential dread and it takes off a few years of my life in the process getting me closer to my goal of dying naturally(sort of..). It’s kind of like suicide but without actually killing myself on the spot. I’m usually pretty private about the fact that I drink everyday. Why? Because I feel like people will just tell me to go to AA where they will essentially teach me how to shame anyone that drinks in general(two drinks on the weekend type of shit) and replace my addiction with a dogmatic organized religion. Don’t get me wrong, I feel like AA has really helped some alcoholics but I don’t believe that shaming the substance addresses the long term problem. 

Alcohol is not the true evil, it’s my trauma that is: 

I don’t drink because alcohol
Is this devil that sucks me in. I drink because I hate existing in this world and I don’t feel fulfilled in my life. I drink because it temporarily helps me stay on this planet for the people that really do care about me and want me to keep existing. Ive dealt with death a few times and have known many people that have lost friends to suicide. I don’t want to put my loved ones through that and so I try to find the best way possible to keep at a life I don’t like to live. It is safe to say that If I didn’t have them, I would have no problem with getting out of my life as quickly as possible. Not wanting to exist is different than wanting to commit suicide. To me, not wanting to exist simply means, I cannot wait for the time that I die of natural causes. 

I know this is perhaps a lot but thanks for taking the time to read ❤️ I would to learn about alternative ways to get help that isn’t AA related so if ya know of any resources of appropriate subreddits to discuss this. Please keep me posted 🙏",1,0

I didn't realize how much I hated the person I am until I stopped using. Everything is a trial now. Everything is hard.

I feel like I'm overstimulating myself every day with social media / porn / video games to the point where I can't stay focused on studying for more than like 3 hours a day. I did stop masturbating for 14 days, but it just felt like to compensate for the dopamine I wasn't getting from masturbating, I spent even more time getting dopamine on social media. ",5,0

It's going well so far, I'm not tempted to take it again as much as I was a couple months ago. I really think this is behind me for the most part.

But since then I've been drinking WAY more than I used to. I don't think it's that bad for now, but I'm afraid it'll get worse. It's been months since I've gone a full day without drinking. It's not at the point where I can't function, and I am, I suppose, a ""good"" drunk (happy and peppy rather than angry and violent), but I still wanna try to stop this before it gets to a bad point. 

I'm working on it, I limit myself as much as I can and I feel like I've been making progress. But I know I still have some ways to go. But I know if I got over one addiction, I must be able to get over this too.",2,0

Who cares if it burns a hole in my pocket
Keep telling myself one more time and I'll stop it
But that's a lie and next week il be back on it 
It's past being hedonistic 
I'm full blown addicted
Maybe I'm neurotic 
But I don't care once I've got it
Go days with no sleep and nothing to eat
And then feel plagued with anxiety 
But the rush is so sweet
It's such a relief
This love/hate relationship is  so deep 
It's a viscous cycle thats hard to escape 
I know there our others that can relate
But it's never to late to quit 
And If your new to it 
then use responsibly 
Or you could end up like me
I'm far from a fiend 
But I am in need of an intervention 
Trust me prevention is better than cure
Stop before you seek that euphoria more and more 
But this is just anonymous advice 
From a hypocrite thats getting high as they write 
But please take these words Into consideration 
Before it causes you devastation 
And if your feeling lost like me then be patient 
The battle can be won it just takes dedication 
You may have troubles in life that add to the equation 
Or you may just be seeking liberation 
I know for most of us it's self medication 
Because life is full of frustration 
So I wrote this poem to bring you inspiration
And I'll end it with a quotation 
 ""Once you make a decision the universe conspires to make it happen""

16 (great for the brain development,i know).

It started at just parties and then snowballed into making all my everyday activities ""more fun"" . As I got out of highschool it became more and more of an addiction. My motivation dropped and my weight climbed. I dropped out of college a month in, didn't have the attention span for school anymore so i decided to take a ""year off"". 

Years go by and I work about 10 different dead end jobs. Feels like nothing makes me happy. I spend the little money I do make on all consumables (alcohol,weed,food) so I work about a decade with zero savings to show for it. At this point I'm fat, single and have basically nothing to show for my life.

Then 2020 hits and on top of a global pandemic beginning, I also start to feel pain in my wrist. I begin to think its carpel tunnel so i see a doctor and take a test.They say it showed I didn't have carpel tunnel after all.

Then I begin to feel pain/stiffness in my neck and again see a doctor and do tests and they say I'm fine. This pain/stiffness then begins over time to spread to my shoulders/traps, to my back, to my knees, to my feet. You get the picture. I've seen countless doctors and specialists since then and tried stretches,lifting at the gym, swimming and more. The doctors don't know whats wrong and i keep getting worse. They suspect fibromyalgia but don't seem to be sure enough to actually diagnose it. It's been nearly 2 years of this and i feel worse than ever. 

You're probably wondering how this still also connects to my weed addiction. Throughout all of this stuff happening I've basically never stopped smoking weed besides here and there for a week or two. I don't know how to live without it.

Now I feel absolutely defeated, I had to move back in with parents because i couldn't keep my job in my amount of pain I'm in. I wake up in pain and everything is so stiff, my jaw cracks all the time now (probably something to do all the tension in my neck and shoulders) .The only money I make is using food courier apps with my mom. I can't do it alone because I don't have a drivers license yet. I feel like if i never started smoking weed,I'd have my licence, a car and a college degree by now but instead I have none of those.

I have no job,licence,vehicle,house,savings or girlfriend. 

I do however have pain,depression,anxiety,suicidal thoughts,parents for roomates and about 60 pounds I now have to lose, great.

I seriously think about jumping off the local bridge on a daily basis and have absolutely no idea how to quit weed after trying edibles, vaping and other alternatives. Quitting cold turkey seems near impossible these days as I have no job to distract me but too much pain to be useful at a job.

I just need advice on what to do as a 26 year old dude with chronic pain who wants to be productive and to be totally sober but can't seem to achieve either. Who just wants to know whats causing this physical pain and to make it stop or at least less intense. I just want a life worth living.",8,1

This sub became sort of a journal to me. Last time I screwed up was about a month ago. Yesterday I went out with friends, had a couple of drinks and when the night was over, the girls went home. Decent time, right before midnight. 

What did I do? Went to a nearby pub. Didn’t drink much but the band was awesome, got wired. When the pub closed, around 2am, what did I do? Went to a club. 

Met a few fun people, one word and I was in the bathroom taking key bumps. I had 8 solid months clean, slipped a month ago, slipped again yesterday. 

The party at the club moved to a guys apartment nearby, there was six of us having beers, chain smoking and doing a few lines. Very few, nothing compared to the all nighters I pulled in the past, but enough to get me home at 10am. 

Fuck. It was a lot of fun. 

I am not depressed, had some sleep, didn’t feel the comedown, but I am sure later today, or maybe tomorrow, there will be some body pain. 

My damn point is: how the hell do I keep myself from doing this?? I have been keeping myself on a leash for a long time. This was the first all-nighter since July 2020… I was so proud of myself for being “normal” lately, keeping my drinking under control, away from blow… 

I want SO BAD to be the person that goes out with friends and goes home before midnight! I need to be this person, I am too damn old to be partying like a 20 something. I should quit drinking, I know. 

How do I do that when the only two or three friends I have left hang out at bars? How do I quit social life entirely? Or should I just accept that a party once in a lifetime will do no harm and it’s fine, I’ll be fine and I will not fall of the wagon, it was just one party in the entire year and I am excused? 

My therapist would tell me to chill. 

I need to see her soon. I need to chill. But I need to work on my self control. Recovery takes so long and it requires so much change… I need to actually change myself instead of just putting my urges in the back burner. 

I hope someone can relate to this so I know I am not the only one that is doing so well, but occasionally still feels like a fraud, a failure or at least, still needing some hard work in some areas.

Worried about casual use going overboard and most importantly worried about ""self-destroy"" mentality","I have been into exploring drugs it's been 4 years now(23M) with my main substances being THC(4 years 1000mg THC total per day avg), Ketamine(2 years on/off 250mg per day), Nicotine(daily), Harmaline(1-month daily treatment every 6 months) & Tramadol(rarely but I still consider it as a friend) 

I am sharing this information because I am reaching a point where I am noticing that although I made sure to stay away from harmful hard drugs like cocaine(never even tried it) and other drugs that have hard-core physical addiction symptoms because I know that is a lost game. However, the substances I cherry-picked were scientifically proven to be safe(for casual use) but lately, life has been getting really really really tough.

My whole country went into an economic/energy/fuel/political/humanitarian crisis and I have been feeling an impending sense of doom that is reinforcing my drug-seeking behaviour and highlighting my cognitive disturbances. I know depression alone is worthy of causing brain fog and it's not like I am suffering mentally but I am feeling like I am operating at 50% capacity compared to how I used to before covid-19 started and things cascaded.

I know my intake is bound to affect my psychology and I am really knowledgeable of how each drug i take has the potential to hurt me in the long run. But since my need for escapism currently is fueled by valid feelings (mental illness has skyrocketed here and suicide rates as well)  and due to the fuel crisis basically, our vital space is decreased to half a mile radius, and with all the electricity cut-offs happening(6 hours blackout per day minimum) getting high is just a natural defense mechanism at this point.

I am not sure what to do because if I keep getting high the way I do I get to remain functional and remain motivated and keep on hustling to get better opportunities in life but I feel like I am burning myself doing this mentally and chemically, and worried that eventually my abuse will catch up to me and cripple my brain, especially while under the influence. Without my horribly built defense mechanisms, I am crippled and unable to provide the same performance level(which is already low). So I am stuck between feeling sorry for myself because I am high or feeling hopeless, depressed and unmotivated because I am sober and aware of the miserable situation I am stuck in.

I think this is less of an addiction and more of a therapy question but I thought I'd try my luck.",2,1

It's already caused me to get in trouble at work and I've lost 15 lb within 2 months, which means for *my specific brain chemistry* it is too much. 

A HUGE side effect for me with uppers is teeth grinding and clenching. I'll look up from 8 hours of doing ~who knows what~ and suddenly have to PAINFULLY detach my upper molars from my lower ones. My teeth ACHE and I have 12-hour headaches sometimes. So I got a cheap teeth grinding mouth guard.

A side effect of having that mouth guard in whenever I'm on Adderall? I CAN'T vape!! To my specific lizard brain, taking out my mouth guard every 15 minutes to hit my vape is way more trouble than it's worth. Funnily enough, the only time I crave nicotine is when I'm on Adderall! I'm quite pleased with this development.

Next step: finding a healthier ""addiction"" that makes Adderall too inconvenient to take! Maybe rock climbing? Adderall would make me too shaky to have grip strength...

I wanted to know the best way to approach my brother, I have been quite hard on him in the past as addiction can make people very challenging. He has issues with meth, alcohol, weed or any substance to stop him feeling. We had a tough upbringing and he has no 'real' friends.

I am not a pushover, but I really want to be supportive while maintaining my sanity. **What is the best thing a family member has done or you wish they had done for you while you were in addiction?** I just don't want him to feel alone.

My brother has been battling addiction for maybe 16 years now, he has been in and out of sentenced rehab twice. Our parents are both addicts (Meth, gambling, alcohol, and more?). Mother is recovered and she is trying her best with him.

I have great respect for people battling addiction everyday, and honestly I think my brother is awesome for what he's achieved despite the odds.

Sorry this was maybe not written very well, I appreciate any responses. Thanks very much :)

Note: not trying to make him stop, just trying to figure out the best way to make him feel supported without being taken advantage of (he is very manipulative when in addiction).",8,0

Now I’ve fallen into depression. Basically nothing feels pointless anymore. I feel like crying constantly and I am afraid I will fall into darkness. Also my physical health has started to give me worries. I’ve gotten heartburn, heart palpitations etc.

Is there anyone who could relate. Is it common that after having success against addictions depression follows. I just am scared of this kinda hopeless feeling. Should I just carry on.

THIS INCLUDES BEST FRIENDS, CLOSE RELATIVES, ANYONE THAT IS A MAJOR PART OF YOUR LIFE. That is just as valid as a romantic relationship, and your pain still deserves to be understood and recognized. Every experience is valuable. I really want to try and understand what my partner is going through; and maybe even help someone else reading do the same. 

I also have 2 questions:

How many serious discussions have you had with them about how they feel and how you feel?
Have they tried to stop at all with a serious intent to get better, and did that change anything for you and your relationship with them? 

My experience, from the addicts perspective:

As an addict, it changed a very close romantic relationship in my life to a very close friendship. It technically lasted 5 years, but we had grown distant romantically as soon as my addiction started 3 years ago. We're no longer together, and are seeing other people. We were codependent (and still are really).

We're still physical and cuddly and share a bed, its just not sexual at all. We still live together, share finances, spend most of our free time together. We are still best friends. We laugh and have alot of fun.

 I stopped using for the most apart about a year and a half ago and started treating her like the queen she is. 
But it just wasn't enough, the damage was done. I accepted it and let her move on because that core relationship is worth everything to me.",3,0

My boyfriend of 6 years has recently started shooting fentanyl or heroin (whichever he can get hold of) several times a day. He was clean for about 4 years before we met, and I believed him when he told me he was done with that life. 

Three years ago he had a very serious medical issue and was put on painkillers, and I believe that’s where things took a turn. He held out for almost a year afterward, but relapsed with heroin soon after. He went through an outpatient rehab program and completed it. But he kept talking about needing to find opiates. He was also going through somewhat of an existential crisis at the time, but refused to see a therapist/psychiatrist for the way he was feeling. 

A couple months ago he went on a business trip, and started using fentanyl. Of course I found out about it when he got home (we live together), so now he just does it out in the open, which makes me very uncomfortable. 

The other day we were on a work call (we work for the same company, but are working from home at the moment) and he was shooting up while on the call, which I found just fucking unbelievable. I was in our office, he was in the bathroom. Sometime later, someone asked for his input on an issue, and he didn’t answer. A few minutes went by and they asked if he had rejoined the call. No answer. 

I went into the bedroom and found him face down on the floor. He was drooling and covered in sweat. His breathing was irregular and very ragged; he was taking huge gulping breaths at odd intervals. I didn’t know what to do and started shaking him and slapping his face to get him to wake up. After a while he came to and I managed to get him into a sitting position. I sat with him and talked to him, and every time he nodded off, I would wake him up again. After some time his breathing improved and he finally seemed like he normally does after he shoots up. 

Later he told me that “things like that sometimes happen” but it was ok and I should do exactly what I did and to never, ever call for an ambulance unless he has stopped breathing completely. He said he was trying to figure out the right dose because he had gotten different pills and he had simply taken a little too much. 

As I write this, he’s on the floor in the bathroom, having just shot up. He can’t even stand up. I am not ok with this. I hate seeing him like this. And I don’t want to babysit a grown man while he shoots opiates every day. I don’t want to cover for him while his work suffers. At the same time, I love him very much and I want to get him help, but he’s not having it. I don’t know what to do, and I don’t have anyone to talk to about this.

He's shown addictive tendencies before and he and I both experimented in our teen years/early 20s, but when his actions started to put him in danger he pretty easily snapped out of it. About 4-5 years ago, he met a couple through his nephew (who is only a few years younger than us) who he started using meth with. He had smoked meth before through a guy he used to associate with, but only saw/could bear to be around every so often. But these two, he started to hang around frequently, and whenever I expressed concern he would just hit the denial button and tell me they ""aren't hardcore tweakers or anything"", that he genuinely enjoys hanging out and playing video games with them, etc. And at this time he still managed to juggle the basic adult responsibilities such as his job and relationship. 

However, after he had been hanging out with the same couple for awhile (I'll call them A & L) I started seeing subtle unhealthy changes such as quitting the job he had held for awhile and hopping to numerous other jobs just to quit a short time after, increasingly negative self image, and eventually his long time boyfriend breaking it off with him and him having to move back in with his parents. At that point, I hoped that would be the rock bottom to wake him up, but it was just the beginning. 

Over time, he lost his car, more jobs, has had several Grindr hook ups go wrong because he meets guys from all over the city that also use through that app, and more recently, gotten into an extremely turbulent relationship with a guy who excessively uses and has on some occasions become violent.

Now, the last few months my friend has begun having delusions. He has always been prone to anxiety and can at times come off paranoid when he reads too much into a situation (which happens to many of us), but now it's just sad to see him so adamantly believing he is being gang stalked and his entire family is against him. He even seems to be thinking I have flipped to the ""side"" of this ""game"" he always talks about where everyone is speaking in riddles, and holding out on some secret that he is being exploited through hackers. A couple months ago these delusions even resulted in him being arrested after trespassing and destructing his parents house after they had to kick him out for the constant terrorizing of them. He was finally somewhere he was forced to get sober (he is completely against going to rehab, even though he knows people who have benefitted from it, so we've had no luck convincing him there) and then bam. The guy he had been seeing who further contributed to excessive using bails him out, and we're back where he started.


In between all this, he's had his share of good days and days he and I can hang out and talk, but I don't know how many times we can have the same conversation when he just turns around and makes the same bad choices that cause him to dig himself deeper and deeper. I just wish he would put his stubborn pride aside enough to just accept proper help, and stop going after the wrong things. It's gotten to the point we all fear for his life. 

TLDR: meth really is a hell of a drug, it's up there with heroin for how much it can fuck up your life and everyone in it. And seems just as hard to escape.

I got into a 4 day argument with my on/off same-sex partner of the last 6 years. I am a closeted individual and and my partner lives in in Europe. I am in the US. We have a lot of issues. 

Anyway, last week I just completely lost my will to fight any longer and I sought out and consumed opiates. I knew how dangerous it was for me so I threw out the rest. I can emphasize enough how I’ve spent every day since then hyper focused on the drug… it’s everything I’ve ever wanted to feel since my PTSD started around age 16-17. 

I don’t want to waste $$$$$ money on withdrawing from my semester. I’ve been on top of deadlines and acing everything until last week. I have a pile of work to turn in. 

I coped with the withdrawal of the oxy on my own, hoping that when it ended I would be able to work my magic and get back on track like I have every other time my mental illness or addiction has affected my work…

…but I can’t stop thinking about the oxy. No feeling in my life has ever compared to it, not doing well in school, not performing well at projects, not praise from professors or superiors, not alcohol or Molly or acid or mushrooms. Why would I pursue anything else when oxy gave me the feeling of total numbness I’ve been searching for my entire life? And if the added bonus is that I could possibly die from it, then I’m feeling just hopeless enough to continue down that route.

Even with the relatively small amount of oxy I took, the withdrawal was intense and it took a lot to grin and bear the consequences until I felt normal again. But now I’m consumed with the obsession of doing it again, because I feel so hopeless and have really lost all Drive and motivation to “fix things” again. Like for who? For what? My parents will never accept me for being gay. My partner will never understand the pain and heaviness I experience daily. 

Last night, I still couldn’t cope, so I drank half a liter of Jameson. Then I called my dealer and ate 6 xannie bars. I woke up this morning still feeling the affect of the Xanax. I can’t even walk straight. 

Do I try to salvage this semester? (I have a month left and taking a leave of absence will 100% a suspect mark on my record and will be break all my working relationships so far.) Or do I beg my family to put me into treatment so it doesn’t get worse? 

My worst fear is that I haven’t hit rock bottom. I thought I did many times but you can ALWAYS sink lower. And, my heart tells me that oxy needs to beat me up first before I’ll be truly willing to live a sober life. 

TL;DR
Do I withdraw my semester (and disappoint my family and throw 25 grand and months of hard work down the drain)? Or do I make it absolutely clear to my family that I need treatment soon before this spirals into something I can’t “fix” anymore? Is there some sort of in-between between those two options where I power through the month I have left in this semester and defer my next semester to enter treatment. 

It really scares me how much I loved and feel obsessed with wanting oxy again.",9,0

But I'm conscious that though the years, these bad thought are getting stronger, and I'm suspecting the weed, and the fact that I'm not confronting the disturbing thoughts because of it (which was the point).
At this moment I feel trapped, I have talked with a few different  psychologists, doctors in addictions, and an hypnotherapist, and I don't seem to find a solution with them. When I try to stop smoking I have panic attacks in the day and nightmares at night, but now the weed is feeling more and more like a poison.

My friends who’ve I’d been smoking weed with for a while asked me if I wanted to try it. I was curious and said yes. I wish I never did. Fast forward 6 months and I’m on 400mg per day just to function and not feel sick, I’m constipated all the time, I sleep during the day and wake during the night. Constantly irritated towards people close to me. My life was all in control of a pill. Almost two weeks ago, me and a friend who also was addicted to tramadol decided we didn’t want this shit no more. No more cold chills and sweats, no more feeling sick all the time. Honestly I didn’t think I would make it to day 12, I really didn’t think I would make it to here. The physical withdrawals are over now, still some sneezing now and then but much better in general. The mental withdrawals is still a battle I face, I still have that thought in my head that wants to buy some more just for the “last time”, and I know I have to suppress that thought. I have to remind myself about the reality of this shitty drug. Once the high is gone, hell awaits. I’m here now, should be grateful and thankful that I wasn’t misfortunate enough to experience a seizure during this time, as some of my friends did. Slowly but surely life becomes exciting again. I start looking forward to the future, something that never happened before. It’s not easy and I know there is still a long way ahead.  This drug took away everything that made me human, my emotions, my confidence, my motivation, my love. I saw myself deteriorate in front of my own eyes day by day, but as long as I was high, it didn’t matter. To anyone who is in a similar situation as me, I wish you the best, life is worth living, not suffering just to exist. I can only move forward from here.",6,0

One time I took laced lsd and it triggered a psychotic break where I didn’t fully stop “tripping” for 2 weeks and it took me months to fully recover. 

I recently learned that uppers also bring the risk of making psychosis permanent. Those months were some the hardest and scariest I’ve ever had to deal with. My family saw most of the beginning and end of that episode and I feel so bad for putting them through that. 

Even though the risk of it becoming permanent is too much to think about, I continue to to do it. It’s messed up to say but in a way those delusions and visual hallucinations make life more interesting. (When they’re not paranoid and fear based) I think I have too much free time and I don’t see a reason not to experience a bit of it from time to time. Even though the reason not to is obviously to prevent another mental breakdown that I might never come back from. 

It’s scary to think it could become permanent if I continue, but I feel like there’s no way I’d be able to achieve the goals I have without it. I rely on it for everything at this point and I dont see another way I could motivate myself to work or finish school without it.

It feels like you can stop today but don’t want to. It feels like just yesterday you were able to stop but now you can’t. It feels like you’re completely shackled. Powerless. Broken. Lost.

Almost like a soldier that was thrown into a war unprepared.

It feels like you’re a prisoner to this voice that you can’t stop hearing that tells you that you need more. It feels like there’s some kind of parasite in your body draining you of life; and knowing – the only way to escape it – is to listen to that voice. And so, you do.

It feels like every choice has been taken away. It feels like your willpower is gone. It feels like no one can possibly understand because you have pushed them all away. It feels like everyone else is to blame.

It feels like someone else did this to you, which caused you to do this to yourself. It feels like emptiness, loneliness, and self-abandonment.

It feels a lot like watching the clock. It feels like losing your dignity – as if something was stolen from you; something so precious that you can’t get back no matter how hard you try.

It feels like those things you said you’d never do – start to sound like great ideas – just to feed that voice yet again.

It feels like blistered feet from walking for miles, just to figure out who’s holding. It feels like looking for potential john’s that may be the source for your next c-note just to get some more but, you’ll settle for twenty bucks or a bag for payment.

It feels like filth. It feels like not showering for days on end. It feels like hunger pangs. It feels like walking around without underwear on. It feels like if you don’t get what you need you won’t be able to breathe. It feels like this thing that has such a hold on you that it controls whether or not you eat, sleep or live. You no longer live for you, you live for it.

It feels like knowing that you’d rather die than face the pain. It feels like constant disappointment as everyone you cross paths with begs you to change your ways.

It feels like shame from robbing money from those you love and not even thinking twice. It feels like abandoning your kids, denying that they need you. It feels like a baby’s tears rolling down your shoulders from holding your son while he cried – to prying little fingers off of you just to leave to go cop.

It’s getting that call that your kids are in foster care but still wanting to go get more. It’s saying to yourself..”they’d be better off without me.” It’s the feeling of unworthiness.

It feels a lot like getting pregnant with someone’s baby you don’t know, just to get an abortion and tell yourself you did the right thing, just to turn around and sell yourself again – with the same risks, but not caring because desperation has taken over.

It’s the kind of unbearable pain you can’t even imagine – a pain I hope you never have to feel – that takes whatever part of yourself that you have left; and destroys it. Because you know deep in your heart, that you’re too far gone.

It feels like not knowing who’s looking back at you when you look into the mirror. It’s like not even wanting to weigh yourself because you know you’re all skin and bones. It’s like hating yourself so bad that you tell yourself you hate everyone that you once loved & believe no one really loves you because it makes that pain more digestible. You tell yourself, if they did, they wouldn’t try to stop me from what I want. They wouldn’t judge me if they did. But you’re wrong.

You just weren’t ready to live without being numb. We don’t like being told what to do, we want to stop on our terms. But, were too scared to try because it feels like we can’t.

It’s like we can’t help but convince ourselves that we can stop because we are in so much denial.

It’s almost as if the signs aren’t enough; like a loaded gun going off right past you.

It feels like nothing else matters. Like whatever you got to do, whatever you have to go through, to get more is worth that high and you’ll do anything.

It feels like lowering yourself to the lowest point just to feel better – because you don’t know any other way now.

It feels like only wanting to feel high and anything else feels frightening. The only feelings that you chase are the euphoria that lies in the bags you purchase – and yet, they lie. They tell you that you are in a calm wave or some kind of safe place of mystic bliss but that’s all gone in a flash.

It feels like coming down and crashing from oblivion. It feels like watching someone else from your own body do things you don’t even want to do anymore. It feels like sitting, waiting, refusing to walk any more steps. It feels like loneliness from burnt bridges. It feels like running out of options.

It feels like knowing that if you don’t stop you’re going to die. It feels like wondering which one you want.

It is like contemplating death because death would be easy. But, you don’t have the balls to pull the trigger or jump off that highway bridge. So you sit and you wonder how to become free, how to change, and you realize that you either continue to do this and eventually die or you choose another way.

It feels like searching for answers and finding none. It feels like hopelessness, uselessness, and sorrow.

It feels like being stuck.

Unable to be helped even if you wanted it. It feels like not believing that you are worthy of it, or that your life makes a difference.

It feels like agonizing emotional pain. Physical and mental exhaustion. Whatever part of your spirit you once had — that is dead. At least it feels like it is because you have long passed the spiritual death. And the clock is ticking…

Time is running out…

It feels cold. It feels like not having a heartbeat anymore. It feels like having a string tied around your toe with a white tag attached with a number written on it. If only you got that other white.

The one that says “welcome”, “Just for today”. If only you had known another way existed. Then maybe, just fucking maybe, you would know what it feels like to recover. Because we do. & you can.

The question is: Do you want to?

To the still suffering addict: I love you. Come Home!

&#x200B;

Getting high tends to muddle everything into one experience, which is why it's so hard for us to separate the different emotions we are feeling. I separated my emotions out when I quit and now they each occupy different places in my inner thoughts.

&#x200B;

The most effective and motivating emotion I was able to distinguish and define was Melancholy. I gave it it's own scene with its own objects and setting and plot and this is what I have.

&#x200B;

There's the kitchen table, and I'm sitting at it.. well not me but more of what I imagined I looked like sitting there everyday after work for 12 years, pipe in my hand. There are no objects on the table; none, just the pipe and i'm holding it. There is nothing in the background or foreground; not that I didn't care to define it but because it appends nothing to the experience. The less there is in the scene the more I capture melancholoy.

&#x200B;

I'm standing there sober, somehow just out of the scene and I imagine a cooling sensation coming from behind me, like an open door or a sheer departure from where I am. I don't think about the past or about my time at the table I only think about the version of me sitting there now. ""What am I looking at? my phone? What am I thinking about; is it joyful? Will friends join me around the table? will the scene change?"" I answer those questions in order, 1-by-1 and I repear the answer to myself. Then, once I've asked all the questions and gotten all my answers a funny thing starts to happen. Those answers form a story and it gets sadder the longer it goes. Then I think of the conclusion; and what I get isn't a life event or change of heart I actually get the full feeling of my wasted time at the table. I can feel the hot thick air of the dimly lit living room; I think of the lack of color and light; I think about where the friends that weren't sitting with me were actually at. I start to feel pity and then I start to feel angry at myself and then comes my salvation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't have to convince that version of myself anything. I don't have to change his mind and I don't have to help him.

&#x200B;

I don't WANT to help him.. I don't care about him.

&#x200B;

And then I turn around and there are my friends and my car that is broken but i'm looking forward to fixing this weekend. I see a table outside where there are people eating lunch and there's an empty spot. I see sunshine. I feel compelled to ask them if they want to catch a show tomorrow night and then; with a slight hangover of the conversation i just had with myself a say

&#x200B;

""Nah don't invite him, he wouldn't want to go anyways"" and then I forget about him and walk though the door.

&#x200B;

He'll always be at the kitchen table. How sad.",2,0

I'm not sure how common users post here for clarity or other selfish reasons but maybe my story will help someone.

&#x200B;

A couple times; maybe even just once if you're unlucky, you feel it drop out of you. It's usually during the times when you're supposed to be the happiest; the times when your emotions and your environment couldn't be farther apart. You'll feel it drain you.

&#x200B;

That moment; usually of shame or regret and accompanied with with a wave of sadness; may be the most powerful tool you'll ever be given. Embrace it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was at a concert with my longtime best friends, my buddy and his girlfriend and was a gorgeous night; music inside; nice quiet picnic benches out back with a pop-up taco cart and some art for sale. I had a friend with me, someone new; someone observant. I was having a blast, coming down off a smoke session I had with the same friends on the journey down to Dallas, we were a group with parity, we were all family of the same kind; a truly wonderful time. Until it wasn't.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It dropped out of me; right in the middle of a song. My friends dancing around me in that sort of shameless way where you could not be bothered about how silly you look, joyful, uninhibited. And then there was me, and only me, and only my perspective; reassured that I was alone in what I was feeling, that I was fraudulent in it, that I was the imposter. Every small decision my happy friends made in the last 24 hours; last week; as far back as I could remember became the laundry list.

&#x200B;

They had relationships; I didn't

&#x200B;

They invested in their friends; I merely checked in with mine

&#x200B;

They could be focused on tomorrow and perfectly at ease with today, I was suspended

&#x200B;

They brought my observant friend along, the thought would have never crossed my mind

&#x200B;

They had a couple bucks for some food and socializing after the show; I made enough money and it was sitting in a plastic bag at home. I couldn't afford a beer because It wasn't in the plan.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Everything in that moment fell in and if there was bridge I would have lept off of it, palms to the sky. I was crying, holding my chest, the waves from the stage pounded more certainly than my own heart. Was I even here?

&#x200B;

And then...

&#x200B;

Instead of hitting bottom; checking out, passing the pen around and then trying to unpack that while stoned, I stayed in it for a second. It was important; something was important about this, I was a 31 yr old man tearing up in the middle of a conert. Where was my joy? who did I let take this from me? who's fucking fault is this I want to FUCKING KNOW. I got an answer.

&#x200B;

""Come with me""

&#x200B;

I went outside with my observant friend, we grabbed a bench; she looked at me and said

""what's wrong?""

&#x200B;

I fucking lost it.

&#x200B;

I had never asked myself that question. I had never waited long enough for someone to ask that question of me. I could not remember the last time I had to answer that question to someone else. It felt invasive; it felt unfair. It was relief.

&#x200B;

You don't need me to tell you what I left off my chest in that moment, it's the same signs scattered across the side of the road; they've been there forever, beated down and weathered; you see them every morning when you wake up; every bowl you pack, every smile you see on someone else's face. It's every moment of contentment you aren't able to grasp. It's all there and it always has been.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But here's your hope. Here's how you know it'll be o.k.

&#x200B;

When it drops, and it will. Ask those questions, even if the only answer you get is the your own angered voice, your own apathy.. At least now your know your enemy.. and you already have the upper hand.

&#x200B;

Is she in relapse or am I just being paranoid?,"4 weeks ago my SO admitted to me she had taken cocaine, but it was a one time deal and it was over. As a recovering addict myself (heroin), I could not blame her, I know the pull from drugs very well, and she was honest, so I said ok.

For the next 2 weeks her behavior changed. We live long distance, so I'm not around to really notice, but it changed in a noticeable way even though we're apart. Significant mood swings, early/late text messages, energy, very talkative. All of these changes I wrote of as her being in a difficult place at the time. 

But 2 weeks ago I went to see her and a lot of things struck me as wrong. Small things said and done, facial expression, snorring, strange nasal sounds, but what really stood out to me was a changed sexual behavior. More agressive, not in a bad way, it's just that she'd never been like this before, and it is so not like her. She also had a strange bruise on her breast.

I'm a little scared she is in relapse, not because cocaine may enter her bloodstream, but the way it may be financed if true. When we met she was very honest with me, telling me that prostitution had been a way of paying for her cocaine habbit in the past. I didn't judge, what is past is past and I know what lows addiction makes us go through. But I'm scared this is now happening again. My addict alarm is screaming out to me.

But I also have a tendency to be paranoid, and I'm not really sure if it's just me being that. How do I go about this? What do you think??",4,0

I would get my meth from a relative who would use with me pretty regularly, but after quitting, he told me he would quit too. I want to believe him as we have set up rules for ourselves that if we decided to not do a drug anymore, we wouldnt and meth was one of them. The problem is that hes been in the garage for about 3 days straight just working on things. Theres no way I could go that long working on things after choosing to stop using meth. I was asleep for days at that point. But also thats how long we would take meth and then sleep, eat, drink water ect. until the next meth binge. I just feel like hes lying to me and if he is, I would be pretty disappointed. We normally hang out so its odd that he would isolate himself like this for 3 days. What do you guys think?

I think my mother is addicted to alcohol. My father and I have talked about it a lot of times that we are worried about her drinking and if it's unhealthy.

Short explanation: my parents have been through a temporary seperation (they've been back together for over 10 years now) , and her then partner emotionally abusing her an ultimately taking his life, financial struggles, only 1 of my grandparents left, I've had issues with depression since I was 17 (I'm 27) and last year around this period she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She's in remission (so that's good). But not a life without bumps.

Before covid and her diagnosis she drank wine at home occasionally (?) ( let's say an average of 4 or 5 glasses of wine a week) but since the past year she started drinking more, I notice because I do groceries for my parents and grandmother most of the time. And every time there was a lot of wine on the list but my father doesn't drink wine. And after a while we even found it she had been hiding some empty bottles here and there in the basement.

My father is pretty meticulous and kept track of all the bottles coming in the house and going to the trash. Now it turned into and average of 5 bottles of wine / week. We've talked to her about it, saying maybe she's feeling out of it most because of that because it's pretty much the only thing that hasn't changed over the past year. But nothing is changing.

On top of that she takes an alprazolam (Xanax) every single day. And her doctor keeps prescribing this, because obviously the doctor doesn't now she drinks this often.

Don't really know how to proceed without coming across blunt or invasive. But I don't want to be insensitive since a lot has happened and I don't know how it feels to have cancer. Although I'm pretty sure I have some Idea of how she feels since I've had multiple depressive episodes. Any advice?

Tldr: went from 4-5 glasses a week to 4-5 bottles a week for a family member, tried to bring it up in a non judging way (if that's possible) and tried telling her maybe she should talk to someone like I do (i go to a psychologist because of longtime depression) but nothing changes. Don't know how to bring it up ""safely""",1,1

It’s so absurd and I’m embarrassed to have bring it up but I can’t be the only one.  I’ve been taking it daily for almost 10 years, usually combined with other otc drugs like Tylenol 1s and dxm but it the main culprit that I can’t stop.  It used to be only after work in the afternoon and evenings but now it’s the thing I do after waking up.

It used to be only 10 a day, but now I swallow handfuls every few hours.     My tolerance has gotten so high any less then 12 does nothing, I’ve been using 80-100 almost every day.  I’ve started shoplifting pharmacies - every day, and I consider myself someone who rather would starve to death before stealing food.  I can’t believe how absurd my behaviour is.  I’ll go through friends and families medicine cabinets and steal anything similar like sleeping spills or Benadryl.

What is does for me? The side effects can be torture and it ruins your short term memory.  Somehow it’s the only way I can in touch this sense of allowing a release of emotion I can’t otherwise experience.  It’s only mildly euphoric while unpleasant at the same time, but I feel so detached from my “real” emotions without it, nothing else seems to matter.  Sex without it is also pleasureless.

One of my brothers, I think, has been an addict for a couple of years now but whenever people have brought it up to him he denies it instantly. 

He lives for the weekend, works all week to go out on the weekend. The thing is, he earns a nice wage, but we never see him buying stuff for himself, he doesn't buy new clothes, new stuff like a phone or a holiday or anything like that. All his money goes instantly to debts and rent. 

In the past other family members have helped him with his debt and now he's in another situation where he's gone back on his word and gone back to his old ways.

I think he's addicted to cocaine. He's always been around people who don't set the best examples, got mixed in with the wrong crowd early on. 

Whenever the situation is brought up to him, he hates talking about it. Close friends around him refuse to believe he's taking drugs when in reality we all know what is going on.

This has been causing arguments within the family and it's starting to take a toll on me and others. My mother already has a ton of other stuff going on and this is making everything even worse. She worries about his health. He has a past of epilepsy and that is not something you should mix any type of drug with, especially cocaine.

I don't know what to do.

He refuses to talk to anyone about it, he denies it, he lives for the weekend, he never has money. This cycle repeats and repeats until it gets to a point where he moves out for a few weeks to clear his head and come back home. 

I've got my own issues, we all do, but I feel this is something which is only going to get worse.

He was doing incredibly well when it came to sobriety, and I did my best to be a good pillar of support for him. For undisclosed reasons, he ended up moving in with me very suddenly, and things went downhill fast.

He began using behind my back and lying about it, which I understand is a part of active addiction. It started heavily affecting both of us, and I begged him to get help. He overdosed in front of me, which was extremely traumatic and terrifying. A few nights ago, a few of his family members and I held an intervention and they came to an agreement that he needs to go back into sober living for his own safety. He told me the only way he would go is if I told him to, and I told him to as I no longer feel like having him live with me is healthy for either of us or safe for him.

He's currently in detox and I feel like such a terrible person and partner for not even knowing he was using, I genuinely couldn't tell until it was too bad to hide. Are there any resources I can use or advice to help me better understand his addiction? I want to be a good support for him, and be able to handle relapses better, as I understand they're a normal part of recovery.

Edit: please don't tell me to leave him or to evaluate if this is something I want to deal with long term, I knew this was very likely from the beginning of our relationship and have no interest in giving up on him

update: I received my first update and I'm so proud of him. For the first time in years, he WANTS help and went out of his way to ask for it.

The porn I am addicted to includes humiliations, femdom, findom, cuck, etc.

**Backround:** I would say about a few years ago (early highschool) I discovered femdom porn videos. At first, they really didn't harm me at all, infact I was super happy to find this genre. I have always been a more submissive type towards women, which I don't honestly have a problem with.

Recently probably about two years ago, I got bored with regular femdom videos, and started to search deeper into this genre. I discovered things such as (penis humilation, findom, cuck videos, you get the idea). At first I didn't think much about jacking off to these types of videos. But eventually the ideas and things I was hearing in these videos made their way into my mind during things such as sports and school. Eventually these things made their way into the way I thought about myself, and has decreased my confidence alot.

**Current situation:** I jack off to these videos almost every day, I can't get off to normal porn anymore because it isn't exciting enough. I don't look at girls the same anymore, I just look at them in a more negative way. Every day I go further into this hole. Today for the first time, I almost sent money to this domme. I stopped myself and knew it was time to seriously take a step back from all of this. 

I don't know why I am here, I would consider myself a good-looking guy, girls don't have a problem being around me, it's not like I am a repulsive individual. I suppose in my past, I have had problems with having no friends, and feeling like I am an outcast, and I suppose that is where this kink drives its roots from. But as I have gotten older, and grown into myself, I don't have these problems anymore, I have friends and girls want to talk to me, so I don't want to drive myself back into this past for no reason.

**My Point:** I just feel as I am at a cross-roads, either I continue down this path and eventually ruin my ability to have a relationship, ruin all of my confidence, waste money, ruin relationships, etc. Or I can get away from this, and not have all of those things happen to me.

I know this is a crucial period in my life where I get to make a lot of big decisions, and I don't want this addiction affecting those decisions.

I am going to go off to college next year, and I would like to get this addiction controlled before I go into a totally new environment.

I just need advice on how to stop these thoughts, and  triggers from making me go back to watching these videos.

Thank you.",1,0

Can’t stop self medicating and it’s affecting my health now too.,"So I was diagnosed with ADHD this year. I think it’s the primary cause of me having so many problems with regulating my consumption of a variety of substances and activities. Almost all the time I feel a constant compulsion to self medicate with *something*. Today I had probably over 100g worth of sugar from coffee as well as my Vyvanse, a bit of my old Ritalin script, weed in the form of thc carts, and a liter of diet soda. My heart rate through the day has been resting around 100bpm and frequently was at 120bpm. I’ve been doing this for like a week or two now, but for the last 5 or so years I’ve had similar problems with varying degrees of degeneracy. I used to have issues with alcohol too but I’ve managed to stay away from that since March. But I’m starting to feel lightheaded generally and because I also eat like shit, I’m scared of what I’m doing to my health. 

But I feel like I can’t stop. I don’t know what to do. Not having these things daily is agonizing because of the constant inner restlessness I feel. I’m so tired all the time too, I can’t resist it. I’m worried I’ll start drinking again also especially because I’ll be alone this whole weekend from Thursday so I could get away with it. I don’t know how to stop the self destructive behavior. It’s starting to have consequences lately but I feel myself almost giving in. I don’t know what I need to do.

Over the last 4 years he has ""graduated"" from functioning alcoholic to being absolutely paralyzed with inebriation and depression. Over the last year or two he has been in-and-out of hospitals and rehab clinics at least 20 times. The hospitalizations have come about largely because he was admitted (voluntarily and involuntarily) for psychiatric evaluation after threatening himself or others with bodily harm. The hospital gets him clean long enough to release him back to society. From there he has either chosen to go to a rehab, or he goes home and starts drinking again. It's now to a point where he just goes home and starts drinking. He has given up on himself and lives his life in a drunken, depressed stupor... sleeping and drinking for weeks-on-end. His wife left him after years of trying to get him straight. His family has tried everything they know to get him help... but due to his adult age, they can't find any way to force him into rehab. His friends have attempted interventions, but he's unwilling to budge.

The family is at wits' end. I expect that if he doesn't find help soon he will either die from this disease, or something tragic will befall him.

He's in a vicious cycle... 
- depression causes him to drink
- drinking amplifies depression
- the hospital and rehab clinics get him clean (temporarily), but neither seems to focus on addressing his underlying depression

So in a hail-Mary attempt... I'm throwing into the hands of Reddit's collective wisdom and experience. How would you deal with this situation?

They found him dead. Overdosed. I just saw him a couple months ago. He seemed to be doing so much better.

But he just couldn’t fucking quit the heroin. 

He had been living with his parents, but they couldn’t enable him anymore. His mom had had to use narcan on him twice. They had young children at home. His parents made an impossible decision and got him an apartment. Also thought he was doing better. He was doing better… 

I am feeling shell shocked. Sick to my stomach. I don’t know who to talk to. I don’t know if I’m allowed to grieve. I wasn’t close, but he was a part of my extended family for the past 12 years. A good kid. I just talked to him a couple months ago…

He doesn’t get another chance this time. That’s it. Every possible future was taken from him. He’ll forever be frozen in this moment. It’s not fucking fair. 

Just needed this off my chest. There’s anger and grief bubbling under the surface. I’m not sure when it will come out. One of my other brother’s best friends met the same fate during the height of the pandemic in 2020. His wife was just charged last week with negligent homicide for leaving him to die in their hotel room when he overdosed. Knew him since childhood.  Spent days numb after I found out before I broke down. I saw him in a dream the morning my nephews were born, the ones my brother was heartbroken he never got to meet. One of them is named after him.

David was an uncle to my niece. He got 11 years with her. That’s it. He’s going to miss all the rest. His parents lived an entire life before him and now have to live an entire life after him. The after is supposed to be for the children, when their parents grow old. Now they’ll always be missing one of their babies.

In the early years of our relationship I would occasionally do hard drugs and tell her about it (cocaine, Molly, mushrooms) and she would be cool with it as long as it was on occasion.

About 5 years ago I began doing cocaine more secretively. It started out ‘here and there’ when I moved away for university and then it turned into a full on weekly habit. I’m an engineer, got a 4.2 GPA in university, and have a good job so everything looked fine on the surface and she really didn’t suspect a thing. Fast forward to last night when she woke me up at 2am after a girls night and confronted me (apparently one of my friends sold me out to his girlfriend who is her best friend). I totally understand why I was told on, I was being secretive and deceptive about what I was doing (she’s asked me in the past and I denied), and when I was confronted I felt it was time to spill the beans.

She’s so hurt. I fully betrayed her trust and I sympathize with her. I never wanted it to get this out of hand but the my use spiralled out of control and before I knew it I felt I was too far gone to tell her in fear of losing her.

I’m really not sure what to do. She left our apartment and is back with her parents but I can tell she didn’t want to leave, she just felt like she had to. I’m so confused, I feel like she deserves better and her friends definitely do as well.

I don’t really have any questions to ask anyone. I just wanted to vent and have no one to go to.",6,0

But I have one question for people...,"I'm getting checked for ADHD next week (which can be really difficult to detect in adults). It would clear up a lot about my past and my gravitating towards drugs + impulsive and avoidance behaviour. 

However, my question: 

Has anybody here with ADHD ever abused MDMA and noticed that they became more calm and lazy rather than extremely energetic and peppy? 

I've just had this curiousity lingering because I know that ADHD meds contain components similar to what's in some stimulant drugs. 

Also, I ask this question here because for some reason the uses of the word ""Molly/MDMA"" are banned in the ADHD subreddit so it's obviously something that people don't want to talk about there. 

Also also... If this is an inappropriate place to bring this up, can somebody please pop me a subreddit that would be relevant? 

Thanks and happy sobriety everyone :)",7,0

I didnt think strangers would understand me more than my own family would. Or even my friends if I can even call them that. I didnt even expect people to read my posts because I just wanted somewhere to vent. I grew up around addiction not knowing how seriously harmful it could be. In my mind, I thought that it was okay because thats how the rest of my family deals with their problems. So it was normal for me to come home from school and see my family either high or drunk. Especially my dad the most. He didnt even care if I smoked and would buy me cigarettes when I would want some to help me deal with my stress. I dont smoke anymore as I stopped smoking after I left high school. I even heard my 11 year old sister now smokes pot and thats so scary to me. I have cut off my connections with my sisters due to the fact that I dont want them to know how bad my addiction is. Pot is okay with me as I dont have a problem with it but it scares me becasue thats how I started off doing drugs. I just want her to stay as a normal kid. I really took my childhood for granted because I so badly wanted to grow up and be an adult. I felt like I never had a real childhood and I would do anything to make sure my little sister doesnt throw it all away so fast. Especially with meth. 

Its crazy how addictive it is. One time and youre hooked. Due to my autism, taste, texture, and how it reacts to my gag reflex is super important to me. I have a super sensitive gag reflex so certain things cant touch my tongue or it will reject it. Most meats and fat will do that for me. Even the taste of meth is too much for my gag reflex and well as the taste. Normally if you want to try something new like sushi for example, if you dont like it, there would be no reason to keep buying it and eating it. That is especially true in my case. But meth is so powerful that even I kept going back to it knowing I hated the taste. I would gag so hard because of the bitterness. If meth can get me hooked on it, then it can get anyone hooked regardless of how awful it is. I like sushi as an occassional treat, but not that much to where Id buy it all the time. If its able to take control of me who is super picky about even my own food, then it just proves how much more dangerous it is. Im the most picky in my family even with drugs so it really does say a lot about how addictive it is. Anyways thank you again if you took the time to read this. I appreciate every comment that people leave. You have no idea how much it makes recovery easier for me everyday. Sleep tight knowing youre helping one person out there put their mind at ease.",10,0

It was about 12 people in total in this rental and an old friend who I hadn’t had the chance to catch up with since the pandemic invited me. They told me beforehand that the people there do “a little bit of snow” and I had no problem with it because, imo who am I to judge people based off their own decisions to do drugs or whatever? 

At some point I had overheard them talking about buying said snow with someone else at the party, I learned later this was because EVERYONE else at the party had been doing lines for the last hour or so, but were doing so outside and I wasn’t aware. Everyone started to come inside to partake as it got late and that party turned into a scary fucking time to say the least. 

I’ve been around people who do snow at parties plenty of times, but not anywhere near like this. I know how it makes people act, but i’ve never seen this side of it. It was all they could talk about and think about. There was a girl with a nosebleed and her friend was crying and screaming about it, convinced she was dying. Another two girls, who were notably skinny, talking and laughing about how ‘scary’ they looked and shaking. A guy zoned out watching the tv for hours with his eyebrows twitching in all directions. Every 30 minutes to an hour they’d all jump up and pull out pans on the stove and it was runny noses all around for the next few minutes. 

I felt really awkward for not talking to them, I was just drinking, watching what was going on, being on my phone in my own little world. Someone came up to me SIX TIMES to ask if I was okay because I was “being very antisocial.”

My friend came up to me and showed me they had been writing in a notebook during this all. They sat on my lap bouncing their legs a million miles an hour and I could feel their heartbeat. They were writing about how they wanted to die. How love isn’t real. How everything is pointless. And they were showing this to everyone at the party, and nobody was even a little concerned. I was scared shitless. I was already quite a few drinks in at that point and couldn’t leave the party. I eventually went upstairs to sleep and nobody noticed. The next morning all that was on my mind was “go the fuck home”  

And I did, and nobody cared. They invited MORE people to do blow, they made screwdrivers at 8am to help the crash. And honestly all I could think was “holy shit I hope my friend is okay”

I wish I could help them somehow, but I feel like it’s not my place to do so. I hadn’t talked to them in forever, but here I was, invited to watching them and their friends binge out. I had never seen a group of people get that fucked up for that long. My friend is very clearly going through some shit but I don’t feel like it would even be appropriate for me to do anything but act like nothing happened. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest, because I feel so strange after that experience. I have insane amounts of sympathy for those who are struggling with or have friends/loved ones struggling with this drug. It is definitely scary. I’ll be picking up naloxone from a pharmacy soon to bring to every party I go to from now on.",1,1

This is my first post ever I’m not entirely sure how this site works but I have no other outlet currently.","My name is Matt. I have the need to tell my story in hopes that anyone can relate. I’m 23 yo I have just graduated college and am lost. I know that a typical thing for a 23 yo but I’m also working on overcoming addiction to multiple drugs. I was a highly functioning addict for 3 years in college. I would wake up and use stimulants (cocaine, adderall, vyvance, Ritalin) to get through the day and need to take Xanax or other sleeping pills to sleep at night. I’m writing this post off the top of my head so I’m sorry if I ramble. I had a drug problem for a long time and my friends knew. It got to the point where I was not sleeping at all, I would take adderall and stay up all night doing homework or gaming. One experience I had was on 100mg of extended adderall was up for three days ended up seeing ants on my bed decided it was time for some sleep lol. Anyway I get to my senior year and a lot of friends reinforce to me that I will die if I continue on this path. Senior year I was taking any drug I could find... mushroom, pills, weed anything you could name. I started to rake molly regularly and I started to dissociate from life a lot. It’s so weird because you know what your doing when you take drugs but you just can’t fucking stop. My problem was with Xanax. The worst night of my life came last may. I was completely stupid. I took molly/ mushrooms for 3 days straight. It was fun and I had a lot of good times but it was depressing and I knew that death was around the corner. After this week of molly and mushrooms I went on a stimulant binge and stays up 3 days straight...
THIS IS WHRE MY STORY BEGINS
So I was up this night after binging stimulants and Xanax for months. I knew something was wrong that night it was like I wasn’t in control of anything. I looked at myself in the mirror and basically said you need to go home right now. I tried to sleep that night and I experienced the worst thing to ever happen to me. I was up now for about 60 hours just praying for some sleep. Finally around 4am I drift asleep and experienced what I can only describe as sleep psychosis. I was pinned to my bed fist clenched and all I could see was a pair of eyes staring back at me. These eyes were mad, they were intense and petrifying. I called my mom immediately she reassured me as always and I tried to sleep again and it happened again. I called my mom told her I’m making the 4 hour drive home I didn’t care I needed to be home. What I experienced felt like a heartache. 
The drive home from my college usually takes around 4 hours. This time it took me 7 1/2 hours to get home.... I do not remember a single thing from my drive home. I got home I couldn’t even formulate sentences.... i went to my bed tried to sleep but as soon as I did my mom described me as hearing a loud thump, she came up and saw me foaming at the mouth and having a seizure. 
She called 911 and I was rushed to the ER. They drug tested me and it came up clean (I had been clean from pills 4 days) so I was able to lie my way out of it. I went back to college went back to taking Xanax. Finally one of my friends called my mom and told her the full situation. 

I am currently in recovery I am seeing therapists, I am in iop, and I am currently taking Zoloft.

I’ll keep it as short as i can. My boyfriend has been in psychosis for 3 months. It gradually got worse & he stopped doing the drug 2 weeks ago. At first it was tactical, visual & auditory hallucinations of bugs, worms/slugs, voices, movement. It grew into well formed delusions of reference, grandeur, and jealousy. He has been convinced everyone is trying to hurt him because he is a special type of person w gold blood and everyone is controlled by slugs. And I especially want to hurt him because he is dark and i am light. And he accused me daily of cheating and lying. We have fought more than we ever have. He has been violent, but not within the past 2 weeks. At first all these were transient, then 100% all day everyday psychosis, and now i have begun to see signs of him come back. Until today; he seems to have had setback and is acting in ways he only was when  on meth during psychosis. Can someone please tell me how long into abstinence do people usually take to be free of psychosis? I read most people will recover, but few may never fully come back.

I did jail time, did probation, kept getting in trouble had no real friends, no family, i had broken every good relationship i had because i just did not care. drugs was all that i thought i needed...and then it all turned around.

Those who stood behind me, thank you. Nature took it’s course. With a warm heart, I’m sorry for the choices I made and am appreciative to those who’ve been there and tried. It didn’t go unnoticed ❤️","Today I began packing my one piece of luggage and one carry on bag that is somehow supposed to hold enough of my shit to last through my 90 day grippy sock vacation. I’m headed to a dual diagnosis treatment center near New Orleans to treat a nasty meth addiction. Been using orally damn near every day for 2.5 years and it’s destroying every facet of my life. 

I’m a 32 yr old female and have quiet borderline personality disorder, CPTSD, major depressive disorder and anxiety. It all appears to trace back to childhood trauma- abandonment issues from being placed in the foster system as a young child. My sister and I hopped from home to home until we ended up in an abusive home for a while.

I started using drugs when I was 13. Coke, weed, a little meth, ecstasy pills, Xanax bars, and alcohol. I didn’t discriminate. Heavy on the Xanax through high school, taking sometimes up to 7 or 8 bars in a day. As a 5’4”, 120 lb female, I probably should have quit breathing in my sleep on numerous occasions. I barely graduated due to attendance issues, but I got very high ASVAB scores. I know if I didn’t get out of this shitty southern town, I was gonna end up overdosed or in jail. I joined the Air Force. 

I cleaned up my act and really excelled in the military. I won a ton of awards, even one of the most prestigious awards the Air Force has—I was one of the 12 Outstanding Airmen of the Year. Long story short, I decided to finish up my enlistment and separate from the military. I had a MST (military sexual trauma) happen to me and ended up with a bad taste in my mouth due to how I was treated by the military afterwards. My husband at the time and I planned a baby, had said baby, and I got out of the military. We moved to Colorado and I went to college for a couple years while taking care of our son. I felt like I “should” have been “happy” at this point in my life…24, married to a man that loved me, a baby, in college and financially stable. Alas, this was not the case and I didn’t understand what was happening to me, just that I needed the pain to stop.

Everything my husband did started to get on my last nerve. They way he cleared his throat would make my blood boil. I quietly suffered from increasing depression and irritability and started to envision hanging myself from our second floor banisters. I was miserable. 

Despite my internal struggles, I was making good grades in school and my previous military award helped make me look great on paper. I decided to apply for a couple badass internships, just to see what would happen. I applied for one at the White House and to my surprise, made it through all the rounds of interviews and red tape. I had something to look forward to now and clung to that spark of hope for dear life. I even decided to go see my family doctor and ask for help with my depression symptoms. I had no formal mental health diagnosis at this time and had never even heard of borderline personality disorder.

I had been sober now for about 7 years, give or take. In hindsight, I should have turned down the huge Ativan prescription my doc offered, knowing I had a serious benzo problem in the past. That piece of paper for 120 Ativan a month (with a number of refills), was likely a contributing factor to the fucked up decisions I was going to make in the near future. 

I took out a $10k loan and rented a small apartment in DC for my 6 month internship. Soon as I got there I was able to breathe a sigh of relief for some reason, and it was confusing to me. I felt guilty for feeling better because I should have felt worse not being with my husband and 2 year old. I started abusing the pills and had a great time working at the White House, however I am ashamed because I don’t remember my time there as well as I wished I did. I also didn’t work as hard as I could have and feel like I squandered one of the best opportunities I’d probably ever have. 

After about four months there, I met a guy on Tinder and fell hard. My husband back home was 11 years older and a super traditional Filipino family man. We met when I was 18 and he was like 30. I never got to party or do anything “exciting” in my adult life, until I left for DC. I felt so free now and I think I tricked myself into thinking I was happy. I started to realize I didn’t want to go back home to Colorado. 

I literally never went back. I fucking abandoned my family and caused so much pain. I will never forgive myself and I don’t expect my son and ex to forgive me either. Biggest regret of my life.

I started drinking a ton and taking adderall too, in addition to my Ativan. My new man was a narcissist, but I didn’t know what that was yet. Oh my lord, we were passionate about everything. My ex was boring so this was heaven to me. We even moved to Manhattan together to work for a startup company he and his college friend invented.

Things became toxic, which eventually progressed to abusive. I took so much adderall and worked so much that it started taking a toll on my mental and physical health. I got super skinny and started hearing music that was not there. It was very quiet, almost indistinguishable, but I could make the music change depending on what I wanted it to sound like. I also started self harming and had a suicide attempt around this time. I started to seek mental health help and was told a couple different diagnoses, even schizophrenia by a doctor I met with one time only, but nothing really seem to fit. After a couple of years with the narcissist, the cheating and the lies and abuse became too much to bear and I left. I moved to Austin, TX.

I’m gonna fast track this story for the next five years and give only a brief synopsis. I just smoked weed daily for this time and was moderately happy. I also got my borderline diagnosis and this is when I started to really become more self aware. It helped me to give a reason (not an excuse) to my impulsive behaviors, chronic emptiness and “splitting” that seems to ruin all of my relationships. 

I moved back to Manhattan with a different boyfriend, because clearly I must learn my lessons more than once. Two years later, I called my momma sobbing, asking her if I can please come home. The physical abuse was getting worse and worse each fight and I was scared at this point. He pulled my hair so severely that I couldn’t raise my eyebrows without my scalp hurting badly and my arms were covered in bruises.

Two days later I packed my car and left that man crying on the doorstep. I drove the 24 hour drive back to my hometown.

I thought my life was over and I was a failure for coming back home. What can seem like the worst thing in the world, however, can actually be a blessing in disguise. I am grateful for what happened to me in NY, because without it, I never would have been back home for what was about to happen to my mom. Which also happened to be my downfall.

My mom was my heart. My best friend and a piece of my soul. I was her and she was me. She had been around 350 lbs my whole life and had health issues. She went for surgery for AFIB, but something went wrong and she was on a ventilator for three days. My stepdad, my sister, and I thought we lost her, but she survived. She ended up losing all of her strength however, and couldn’t walk, use the restroom on her own, even reposition her own legs properly. She tried her hardest in short term rehab to get stronger but it wasn’t working. She was in the ICU probably about four times in the next six months and almost died each time. I spent the night by her side every single night, sleeping in a chair for over three of the six months before she died, taking care of her every need, cheering her up and advocating for her. 

It’s exhausting and unsustainable to be present 24/7 like that. Especially while trying to work, I owned a small business at the time. I started orally taking small bits of meth to give me energy. 

I watched her bleed out enough from her rectum to produce a pool of blood around her hospital bed, watched her cry out in agony more times than I can count, and said my goodbyes to her more than once when doctors said she was going to die. I also became aware of abuse and neglect against her while she was at a nursing home in between hospital stays. I wasn’t allowed to stay the night with her there, but I sure as shit began popping in at all hours of the day and night to do random checks on my mom. 3 am, 3 pm, it didn’t matter, I’m going up there.

Meth use really starts to ramp up and I begin questioning myself, am I addicted?

Because I was the only one going up to take care of my mom, her and I decided to get a notary to secretly come to the hospital and we signed a medical POA, giving me the right to make end of life decisions that trump my stepfather’s rights. I knew how she was suffering, even though my family chose to ignore it. I chose to utilize my rights when she was septic in the ICU and gasping for air, but they couldn’t give her pain medication because of her health issues. My stepdad left for the night, and I was pissed off that he could leave her in such a state. I called him and told him about the POA and told him that he needs to come back because in 30 minutes I’m having the nurses start comfort care. He came and they discontinued her antibiotics and stuff and replaced it with morphine and Ativan. 

It took her three long days to die. I questioned my decision constantly and it felt like I was dying right alongside my best friend. I know that I made the right choice and my mom is proud of me for advocating for her, but my stepdad disowned me shortly afterwards. Kicked me out of my moms house a couple weeks after she died.

By the end of the six months that mom was hospitalized, I was taking considerably more meth than when I started. I was staying up for multiple days and having numerous negative side effects for sure. The PTSD of things I experienced with my mom haunt me  to this day and my BPD is worse than ever too.

She died over two years ago now, so it’s been over 2.5 years of almost daily use and it’s made my life unmanageable. Every facet of life has been effected and I’m ready to do better finally. It served its purpose…I took the best care of my mom when she needed me most and I would do this all over again in a fucking heartbeat if I had to. But the best way for me to honor my momma is to get a handle on my mental health and my addiction, because she was never able to do that for herself when she was alive. She wants that for me, I know nothing else would make her more proud. 

That being said, I’m doing this for me… I deserve so much more than I give myself. I’ll never have a shot of true happiness and healthy love until I sober up and learn new ways.

I’m going to rehab in 2 days and I’m going to unpack all of this shit and leave it there. It’s too heavy for me to carry around everyday. I’m scared af but also optimistic. I have a lot of hurdles to navigate when my 90 days are over but for now, I’m going to live in the moment and heal.

I'm not sure what I should do to stop, I'm heavily into fetish and weed consumes probably half if not more of my income. All of my addictions are in a cycle one after another after another keeping me in this cycle and I do them all together, masturbate, cig, weed,  I smoke a cig sometimes just by itself like at work but I have thought about masturbating at work too, and I actually have at my last job since it was slow most of the time and I could have a smoke most the time. I feel like these completely kill my drive and motivation and me feeling weak and ashamed of everything makes me have shit motivation and confidence too. I also have anxiety on top of that mountain of shit. I've failed my college program because of this I feel like and although I appealed, I'm pretty sure they're not letting me continue the program. So boom student loans now, I'm probably losing my job soon again so I already started looking for another one but my biggest adversary is my mind I don't know what to do. I shit you not I could be in a much better situation if I wasn't so reckless with my money and had my motivation. I didn't fall this hard until I moved my ex in with me 4 years ago and she physically abused me ever since I've never been the same and used Marijuana and masturbation obsessively and abusively since. I feel like I know how to break these cycles but even when I get to it its like ""ill do it tomorrow"" while still actively doing it and knowing I'm fucking myself over continuously. My impulsiveness, the addictions, i feel like they're destroying me and my life is falling apart and I'm letting my family and siblings down.",1,0

I can do any amount of uppers, but alcohol and weed are detrimental for me. Probably because of the myriad of psychotic experiences while on them. 

I'm sober since around a week and a half though, I met one of my dealers the other day and refused an opportunity to get free weed. it's why I'm here:  

I've been down the rabbit hole for at least 15 years, even 20, and the depth of it is only now starting to become clear.  

I mean I have a totally different political view when sober, just to give a wild example.  
I signed up for a coding school.
I had intense, intelligent, day long discussions with friends I kept at bay for decades.  

In order to keep this short,

__keep it simple guys, if you're clean for a day, do the second one, and so on. Getting KO isn't worth losing the progress, plus if you wake up sober you can remember how good it felt the day before too.__

I no longer take benadryl as it had given me OD like symptoms but fortunately didnt take my life. I had been going through a loss for almost a year now and next month marks the first year. When that happened, I thought I would look to my closest friends for support that Id known for about 4 years. They didnt really respond the way that I hoped and since then, I always felt like they stopped caring about me. It caused me to just repress my loss as best as I can and not talk about it with them. I couldnt deal with feeling so alone though and I was soon attracted to more drugs except things that were much more dangerous such as oxycodone, meth and lsd. I know lsd isnt as huge as meth but I mixed lsd and meth one day and it caused me to have severe breathing issues. I have a heart condition that is just progressively getting worse and I so badly want to stop meth the most. As much as I hate it, I feel like I cant stop taking it.

I decided yesterday to build up the courage to tell my friends because I cant stand going through the dangers of my health. I had one friend that told me I should tell the group because its clearly hurting me and having some sort of support would give me the right motivation to never use it again. So I told the group about how much excruciating pain I was in from the substance abuse and that I just wanted their support in helping me through it. They all basically ignored me and even though its only been a day, Im already experiencing withdrawel symptoms and its one of the worst things Ive gone through in awhile. This is just one of those drugs you should never try and it destroyed my life in just a few days. And using it for longer than a few days ruins you completely. 

It hurts my insides so much and I just want to sleep finally. I have been having those really dark thoughts but in my mind, I dont actually want to lose the rest of my life. I just want to be better and just have at least one friend. I have this friend who is really busy with college so he finally messaged me after a whole month, and I believed he would be the only person I had real faith in that he wouldnt let me down. He did promise to come down to see me and I was hopeful and I even decided to use my drug money to buy the perfect christmas present. It was difficult but he deserved a special gift than for me to choose drugs over our friendship as he means that much to me. But he said that he wouldnt be able to come down to see me after all even though Id been waiting since summer. I finally broke down with all my emotions pouring out and effectively making me believe that my only real friends are alcohol and drugs.

I have the potential to change and be better but I just need a friend that will support me. I know deep down that I want to sober up because I dont want it to overtake my life and keep me from enjoying anything. I have gone through the whole day sober but I cant deal with the withdraw symptoms. Ive only ever wanted someone to tell me that everything is going to be okay but I feel like the friends that I did have have no problem making me feel like everyone failed me. I feel like everyone who I ever cared for and loved wont do the same to help me when I really need it. I always feel so awful, that I cant even feel comfortable lying down as I need to always constantly vomit except its just bile. I knew meth was a drug that is bad but its worse than just bad. Its horrifying and I would never recommend it. I was drawn to it due to the rush of euphoria but it can turn scary so fast. Your life is too valuable to put it through this type of torture and suffering. I cant even think about all the things it has put me through without breaking down. Just please dont ever even think about using a drug like this. I thought going through my loss was my rock bottom but this is worse than just going through depression. It has been a seriously tough year for basically everyone but dont try to ""make it better"" by making yourself suffer more.",3,0

This is gonna sound absolutely nuts but I have an addiction (or an unhealthy obsession) with a TV show. I know. A lot of people here are struggling with drugs and my weak ass is obsessed with a TV show. 

I can’t really go into too much detail but what I can say was I  used to fantasize about it constantly. I was behind on work, I got distant in my social life, and I used to keep myself up at night just so I could keep daydreaming about a couple characters in the show. They made me feel warm and fuzzy inside. I had found ways to cope with having this but I recently came to the conclusion that I need to cut myself off from this show entirely.

(I have another Reddit post on AITA if you want to look through my post history for the explanation.)

Her circle of friends have had multiple overdoses (a lot of fentanyl laced drugs) and I also know that mixing recreational drugs with prescription drugs can kill too. 

She’s on oxy, lorazepam, sleeping pills, baclofen, tagamet, seizure medication, another pain killer, tylenol3 and about 5 other prescriptions which I don’t know all of them. We share the same family doctor and I feel like he should know incase there’s something he prescribes her that will interact with what she’s taking (I don’t know what for sure, but more than likely it is coke — if not it’s meth or speed. Also smokes weed but that’s normal here)

I’m just in a hard place here because me knowing has completely shattered our relationship, and I feel like this is only going to make it worse but I don’t want to find my mother ODing in her bed, or worse when I move out of here and she’s all alone with nobody to check on her. 

I know she isnt going to go to rehab even if her doctor recommends it, I just don’t know what the right thing to do is here. Ignore her addiction and let her figure it out alone since that’s clearly what she wants or do I try to save her anyways even though she’ll hate me. 

Also in the case of an OD, we have naloxone kits in our building, is that safe to administer with so many prescriptions? I don’t know what to do I just want to help. She’s also had medical issues in the last year like extreme fatigue, shes very underweight (lanugo and all), sometimes blood in her urine and complains of severe chest pain and trouble breathing.",7,0

415,2021-11-04 08:44:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/qmjqg2/lsd_almost_made_me_kill_myself/,LSD almost made me kill myself.,"After sitting on my old memories I decided to finally just say it somewhere. Take it as something I just need to put it off my chest. 

I got into psychedelic culture some years ago, watched a lot of youtube about it, read stories from reddit – it all looked super cool, and people were telling me how trips made them better people, and beautiful trips, beautiful feelings. Even when I would read about the bad trips, people still sounded very convincing about how it's a very teaching experience and you have to accept it as it comes. 

Then came a day when I decided to try. I did LSD, I did it again, then again, and again. And fucking again. And a lot of bad things have happened since then. Thankfully, I’m recovering from said bad things and almost back to normal. 

Today I finally want to say that I fucking hate pschycodelic’s community, it’s one of the most irresponsible places I’ve come across. It’s a place that treats any negative experience immediately as “you’re just prone to mental disorders, not everyone is like you, you just have schizophrenia running in your genes”. People there absolutely invalidate the idea that psychedelics literally can make you go mad, yet they believe the most twisted things they thought of during their trip. People who take acid will literally believe ANYTHING that happens during their trip, but not a chance in the world will they believe that someone says LSD did them bad and it fucked their whole life. 

Yes, it taught me a lot, but so does any other difficult experience in my life. 

There are people who say you can’t be addicted to LSD, then when you ask them what is the worst thing about LSD and they say not having enough of it. 

I was addicted to it. I took it every 2 weeks NOT because I did not want to take it more often, but because the internet told me that it takes exactly 2 weeks for you to feel the full-ish effect of it again. 

In the end of all that I went psychotic, I didn’t just have a trip that was psychotic, but after I got out of the trip and promised myself to never do drugs again – when I was feeling I am sobering up and I’m coming back to normal – it would happen, I would get back into my trip while being absolutely sober. I would get psychotic, absolutely randomly, my mind would shift to a state that I clearly remember as LSD, and I’m back slowly sinking into the worst trip I could remember. It wasn’t just memories, I saw things, I felt things, I heard things, it was just like LSD. 

I was so scared of reality, and still am sometimes. I’m scared of paying attention to things or thinking too much as I feel I’m gonna be drugged back into that hell. 

I had to be on medication for a year to start to feel like I can look at photos of my ex with whom I would trip without slowly sinking into insanity. Whenever I would get psychotic I had this strong feeling like during my bad trips that if I let reality to disappear too much I’d just kill myself wether I wanted it or not. 

I regret ever taking LSD. Life can teach you the same things without drugs. I know it now, and I know it by trying hard and working on myself instead of putting a tab of chemicals under my tongue. 

LSD was a gateway to my insanity and more drugs that happened after. 

I used to WANT people to take drugs. I would recommend it, I would tell people how to be safe.

Me these days will never ever encourage anyone to take anything in any way, shape or form. 

The only true thing LSD taught me is that drugs can trully fuck you up, some will destroy you physically first, but others will take your mind first. 

LSD gave me a preview of what I will be if I keep taking drugs, including alcohol. 

And alcohol is still the reminder to me, my mind STILL tells me sometimes it’s okay to drink, that you’re social, just for the company so you’re on the same wavelength. 

Fuck all of that. I know that in my hands alcohol can become what LSD became to me. And I DO NOT want to see the consequences of it, I know it’s grim and dark at the end of any substance. 

I just want to be sober. I just want to live a normal life. I don’t need to know the truths about the universe. I don’t need to feel like the universe itself is jerking me off. I don’t need magic. 

I hope one day all my drug memories will feel like distant dreams and won’t mean much to my mental state. 

Thank you for listening if anyone made it to the end.

Yours truly,
LSD hater :)",42,0

I took Norco 2 years for severe pain from surgery and body got dependant so i was started on suboxone . So I've also Been on suboxone for 2.5 years. Been great just  sometimes gives me nausea  so I asked my dr whose Gen doctor and also addiction dr if I could try subutex. See if it'd make me less nauseated sometimes. 
I started it   Oct 27.My last suboxone was Oct 25 night prior to that wed. Everything good .


Ii took a subutex Oct 29th around 7pm.
Halloween, I all night movies and around 7 am Nov 1 I finally am going to bed. I'm exhausted so I went to take    .3 of suboxone film  because I forgot I was on subutex.  Literally 2 minutes after swallowing the dissolved film I felt like this weakness going through my body. Immediately. I felt it getting worse and worse. My hands were really shaky and then my entire body was shaking like crazy. Really badly. I felt anxious , flushed,  and I had frequent diarrhea. The extreme shaking lasted 35 mins and the diarrhea lasted 10 hours.  Anxiety was terrible. 
I went to the er and only thing that helped was the Ativan because it knocked mewe'd. They gave me iv fluids and two shots of Phenergan which I take occasionally at home in pill form. The Ativan they gave me via iv made me relax so much I fell asleep and finally was sent home and able to sleep around 1030pm.
Next morning woke up maybe 8 am ish and was anxious so I nervously thought ok let's try the suboxone again but much smaller piece .  About .1 mg(was .3mg last time )and it started happening again...so I took my subutex which made it all stop pretty fast ....

My dr doesn't want to continue on subutex and wants me to go back on suboxone but my body keeps extremely rejecting it now.
I have no narcotics In me. I called him the day it started and he has no idea . I told him I had taken benedryl, Phenergan and advil, and gabapebtin in the past 2 days which I do every now and then for nausea or to sleep or joint pain. And he said those and the subutex wouldn't cause any of those problems like this.

At er I had blood done flu and covid test and everything was fine. 

Wtf is happening .I need to go om the suboxone as the subutex doesn't seem to last long and be doesnt want me to continue another month.
I want to get off the subs but I was going to start slowly coming off after Christmas  but I can't even tolerate suboxone and am stuck on subutex  which makes me anxious if I haven't taken recently where as suboxone I can take a
Small doses every 2 days max with no downside .


Anyone have a clue what's happening ... why is my body rejecting the suboxone how do I fix this so I can go back to suboxone . Any similar experience .

I'm not on any opiods or other drugs.  I'm not dependant or addicted to any of the other meds I occasionally take (ones I listed above )
And I will be trying to get off buph after Christmas but I can't until then but I really need to get om suboxone again... going a full day without subutex didn't help...the bad reaction I had was so extreme and terrifying and I tried so hard to sleep it off.

Everyone even the addiction dr said I can take subooxnr and subitex fine . Noone knows why this is happening me.

God it was at least 20 hours since I took my subutex and that happened ....

It happened again qhen I tried yesterday morning which was at least 30 ish hour since the subutex. I took am even smaller suboxone and it started and the only thing that stopped it was subutex 

I hate this. I want to go back on suboxone as I feel like subitex isn't last as long and  I keep getting anxious and needing to take one .. idk what I'm going to do I need to go back om suboxone but I keep having this reaction",1,1

She left the job and eventually found a new one, but I lost contact with her because her number was disconnected. Fortunately I had her email address, so I sent an email to get back in touch. She's texted me from a few different numbers, it seems like she cycles through them quickly, and she had asked me for money recently for a doctor's appointment, which I sent through PayPal. The different phone numbers and asking me for money raised red flags for me and I'm worried she may have relapsed. We have been wanting to meet up, but she is inconsistent with communication which is fine, I have other friends like that and I know what it's like being inconsistent as well. I try to keep in touch with her, but sometimes she won't respond.

I'm not upset about the lack of communication. I always write it off as she is busy. She has two kids with her boyfriend. Again, I'm just really worried she may have relapsed. I always want to think the best of people and I'd hate to think she may have lied to me about what the money was for, but based on previous conversations we've had and her being there with me when I gave a homeless woman money, food, and a ride, I'm thinking that may be the case. She recognized that the woman was lying to me for money and was most likely a prostitute and/or drug addict because of her tattoos and behavior and I gave her way too much money.

It was a 2 and a half week relapse (16 days) that we had 10 months clean time on before we f^cked up. DOC=METH. We both are looking for more support in the addiction area from groups and doctors appts, however for the sake of not f^cking up our family, we did some research and ended up bleaching our hair twice, dying it three times, and 3 mucujo washes. Except my husband did one less mucujo wash and put no-lye hair relaxer on his hair..... clumps started falling out so we seeked professional help. The drug testing facility didn't say anything and now the test is done and we are waiting on the results. We both had chemical burns in our scalp and my SO had chuncks from his scalp falling out. Please no negative stuff. We know we are fuck ups but we are trying very hard to change. If anyone has some experience with this or if you have any meaningful advice... please comment!",1,0

this? i havent even really got sober from my worse chronic drug and alcohol addictions, they are just better than they were at rock bottom. so i dont know how to overcome shit, meetings somefimes made me
feel worse and i couldnt find a sponsor and have to be completely sober to get one, and years of therapy hasnt done shit.",3,0
436,2021-11-03 03:57:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/qlpnph/writing_to_remember_who_i_am/,Writing to remember who I am,"This is my story and I want to share, it's gonna be pretty long and there are a lot of stories about my drug abuse and mental illness as a teenager. It would be cool if people read it but I'm mainly writing for some catharsis. 22M btw.

When I was 12 my father killed himself. I had just started high school about 2 weeks prior. I remember being in class and getting a text from him that just said ""Bye"" 

He had been completed consumed by depression for around a year before he died. It was disturbing watching my dad who I looked up to so much turn into a hollow shell who would self harm and tell me how much he wanted to die. It scared the shit out of me and I remember feeling as if my life was over and there was nothing good from this point onwards.

I didn't cry when he died. I had become so shut down and numb.

I hated myself and would constantly act out to try and impress people. I didn't care about getting into trouble or hurting people to impress my peers. And to my surprise this ended up making me pretty popular in school.

I loved the attention I was getting and would constantly look for the next crazy thing. 

When I was 13 a friend of a friend introduced me to weed and I bought a gram. I loved how it made me feel. I loved having my consciousness altered. And I loved having an excuse to be reckless and act out because I was ""high"" 

I wanted to be high all the time, it took me far away from my reality. It comforted me from the bad memories and made good times even better. It wasn't long until my friends began to get sick of my behavior and relationships turned bad. But I didn't care because I could just get high and then it didn't matter.

I'm around 15 now and at this stage I couldn't function without weed and would have panic attacks if I ran out without being able to resupply. I began stealing from my mother and brother to fund the habit and also began to get in debt with drug dealers.

One day I went out to my ""friends"" and an older guy was there, we went to a house and he pulled out a huge bag of coke and started doing out lines. He said I could have one for free and I said yes and took it without thinking twice. 

It felt crazy, I felt extremely tense and paranoid because I knew I had to go home that evening. But when I was offered another line I said yes and took another one. We all became extremely paranoid because my friends parents were coming home and none of us could keep it together, pacing back and forth and talking non stop. we were all 15 so the drugs were having an overwhelming affect on us. We ended up leaving the house and walking through fields in the dark and hiding under a bridge that night. We also snorted the entire bag which turned out to be cut with some kind of amphetamine. 

After this night I got that same feeling I had when my dad died where it felt like my life was over, I had hit a new low. 

Weed began making me extremely paranoid but I couldn't stop smoking it. I would smoke and have full blown panic attacks and psychosis by myself in my room, then come down and smoke again having another panic attack. 

I eventually quit weed and became extremely depressed. Dropped out of school at 16 and socially isolated myself. My old friend group got back in touch with me and began to invite me out drinking with them.

I would spend all week sleeping and sitting in my bed in a dark room and then go out on the weekend and drink myself unconscious. I would buy those 200ml bottles of vodka and open my throat downing them in one go. Ecstasy was becoming popular and I would begin to use it around this time too. I would often wake up covered in my own vomit and piss.

This went on until I was 18 and old enough to drink in pubs and would continue drinking and drugging every weekend consuming until I couldn't consume any more. I had started using coke again and was beginning to form a habit and couldn't go out without it.

I loved coke. It was my drug of choice and would go out just to take it. Sometimes going to clubs and spending 90% of the night in the bathroom snorting coke and often mixing it with MDMA.

My life was a complete mess. I lost touch with reality. Lost touch with myself. Was extremely depressed and every night I went out I secretly hoped I would die of an overdose. 

This continued until COVID-19 shut down the pubs and clubs and suddenly I didn't have anywhere to party. I could never do it at home for some reason as I just didn't enjoy it. 

The last time I drank was 5 months ago and after 5 beers I left and spent all my savings on coke. I can't drink... Not even 1 or 2. 

I'm going through a pretty bad bout of depression at the moment and wanted to remember my story and how far I have come instead of focusing on all the things that are wrong in my life right now. 

I don't think many people will read all of this as it's very long and probably not that interesting. But if you did thank you for reading!",26,1

I don’t know any other way to put it other than “this is hell”. I want to bang my head against the wall. The anxiety/panic attacks have been consuming my every day life since I quit. My chest hurts, I cry every day, my appetite is all over the place, I can’t focus, I cough randomly, I feel constantly dizzy and falling asleep is ten times harder. I have had to do breathing exercises EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. What’s even worse is that I’m already on Wellbutrin, and that hasn’t helped as much as I thought it would.

I wish somebody would’ve told me how stupid this addiction is and that the buzz only lasts a few seconds, and after that you rarely get a buzz and you find yourself doing it just because your brain is controlled by a dumb little smoking device. Take this as sign to never do it if you’ve been getting curious because your friends do it (or because of the bright packaging with fruity flavors). The withdrawals are absolutely not worth it. 

Anyways, this was a vent/rant that nobody might see but again, these are things I wish I would’ve read about before I made the decision to buy my first vape and hopefully it keeps at least one person from doing the same thing. I hope this sh*t ends soon, but in the meantime if anybody has any advice on how to help the withdrawals I’d greatly appreciate it.

I know some don't view this as a real addiction but it's really messed with my marriage. From the get go my expectations of sex were entirely wrong. Add to this the fact that my wife has a very low libido and that sex is physiologically uncomfortable for her and you begin to see the issue.

She is aware of my problem and is understanding. She has offered to have sex with me if I have the urge to watch porn. The core of the issue is that I know that I'm hurting her when we do. So I fall back on porn to deal with anxiety. In addition the only way she can have sex comfortably is very vanilla. Over the years whatever spark there was has gone out of it. It feels like I'm using her. I hate that. We are very much in love and willing to fight for our marriage, but las night she told me she felt like there was no bonding when we have sex.

You try not to look at them as you tentatively test your footing.

 Your new boss is going on about how vaccines are the new smoking and that if Trump had won we'd never have had to raise the debt ceiling again.

To give a little background, I am a recovering addict (35f),  I'm not judging her. She moved away with my nephew and her husband about 10 years ago. They ended up getting a divorce and she lost custody of her son. After that, she went off the deep end. She dabbled in meth and heroin before she got married and I'm guessing that never stopped (I can't know for sure bc she is a massive liar and manipulator) She claims that someone gave her several hits of acid without her knowledge and it completely scrambled her brain. She was a paralegal before all of this.
Fast forward to present day.
She is currently battling manic depression and claims she hears voices all the time. I've witnessed this. Its quite unsettling. I have no idea who this person is. She lives with my parents. She has days on end where she just walks around and has her headphones in and doesn't speak or interact with anyone. She's been on several medications to try and balance her out. Some have worked and she becomes lucid and you can have an actual conversation with her. This only lasts a short period of time until she inevitably thinks she's doing better, goes out and gets drunk or high and falls right back into not speaking to anyone and just wandering my parents house again. She gets violent and will not take responsibility for anything she has done. My parents are at their wits end and have no idea what to do. They've found foils and pipes in her room along with baggies of drugs of all kinds. She denies that she's doing drugs to their faces everytime they confront her about it. They've had to call the police on her and have her taken in on an involuntary psychiatric hold. She's been to mental health centers and rehab for a short time. Once she's in these places she calls my mom to berate her and my dad and make them feel like its all their fault that she's in there and begs and threatens them if they don't get her out. I feel awful for my parents and have told them they are not capable of offering her the help she needs. I have no idea what I can do to help at all. We're all pretty lost at this point.",7,0

He wasn’t the type of person to want to live his life as a vegetable which is quickly what he became. He couldn’t communicate his needs and had a tracheotomy so every time he tried to communicate he would become frustrated and start fighting against the restrains on his arms. Just seeing someone fight so hard not having any idea they are dying from cancer, just strapped to his bed drugged out of their mind on fentanyl. When we made the decision to take him off life support he fought for 11 hours. Gasping and reaching into the air. I have never seen anyone die until that day. I’ve had mental health issues since childhood and I can firmly say this has broken something inside my head. I’m just stumbling along blindly. I would see him sitting on my couch or hear him say my name. It felt so real like he was standing directly beside me. I was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. When he died I came home and decided I needed a drink and I was offered some cocaine. I had been feeling so empty after the loss of my dad I said whatever and used. The addiction was immediate.

On average a half gram of coke costs $50 in my location. So there’s no way I can afford to be fucking up this badly. I never really got into onlyfans but I have sold a ton of content in the pursuit of my drug. The guilt is insurmountable but I feel the pull in my chest begging me to get more. Just a few more hours of energetic happiness that I don’t experience with any other hobby. I know in my mind that I need to quit and I want to be over it. But it’s like there is another person in my head that rules over everything. I feel so lost. I went to a Halloween party last night because I hadn’t really gone anywhere in weeks. Nearly everyone there had cocaine and freely offered it every few minutes. 8 hours later and I feel like I’m about to die. I went to the ER to get help. I felt like such a burden like I was taking over a bed for someone who matters. I feel so hopeless. I’ve started self harming again. I just feel like I’ve died and I’m just trapped here. Sorry this was so long. I hope everyone else who is suffering feels better than I do right now. I won’t have insurance until the first of January but I intend to save up some money so I can go to rehab. My addiction will require medical assistance. I just feel so guilty I’ve gotten this bad.",25,0

453,2021-11-02 09:51:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/ql4ofa/mdma_addiction_is_real/,MDMA Addiction Is Real,"Before I used MDMA I researched it heavily because I used to be so scared of trying anything. I had only tried shrooms and pot and this was a big step for me to try and never thought I would. In my research I read that it can be psychologically addicting but your body won’t crave it, only your mind.

The people that supplied it to me had 3,000 pills and gave me one. After the first time, I could not stop thinking about it. This was March 2021 and now its November. I’ve taken at least over 20 doses of MDMA and have not spaced it out properly, only waiting around 2 weeks, 3 weeks at best. 

After the first time I knew I wanted to take it again and take it soon. But I told myself that I wouldn’t ever take more than one pill in a night, but then the people with the 3,000 pills gave me 12 rolls in one night. I was getting rolls for free and it was good shit, crystal MDMA and at most they’d charge me $15 a pill. 

My mind is so utterly addicted to this substance and it makes me so worried. I am in therapy and I do track my progress and it’s been 2 months and 8 days. I am addicted to the way music sounds, the way I can feel confident and sure of myself, the way I can love people and tell them how I really feel so flawlessly. I love the way my anxiety and inner voice get muted. The way my body melts into a peaceful, comfortable numbness. But I hate when I start coming down. The impending doom of losing the beautiful euphoria of ecstasy. I start to panic, look and see how everyone else is doing and if we want to re-up. For the most part everyone does but that’s how one roll turns into a bender. I forgot how to be happy without it. Everything else seems so mediocre without it. I’m trying so hard but I live vicariously through the memories of this past year and rolling. 

How can I learn to love life again? How can I learn to look at the world and not see what it’s lacking? Please.",9,0

i fully know and have accepted i wont ever pick up meth or pills again, but for some reason i dont think i am ready to say that about cocaine and alcohol.

 when im driving home at night after my construction job or in the shower or anytime. really- i think of the euphoria, i feel the drip and the euphoria. but instead of caving like before with my bad meth addiction, i think.... okay, 1 drink.. and then what? 3 or 4 ? and then what? a gram of coke? and then what? and i rationalize with that method- that the short high isnt worth my life, but it still comes to me, these thoughts are always popping up in the back of my head. 

just a struggling drug addict who doesnt use drugs, but is having a hard time. i guess im here to say if there is anyone out there like me- to keep on going. this shit can get really hard but its worth it to persevere. 

stay safe out there,
much love",16,0

She talked to me like crap. The next day she says its over and she doesn't wanna be with such a loser. Ive been clean for years. Surfing the net i found an add for party favors. I  was actually just looking at girls online. So I texted,  bought a gram of coke split it with my buddy. Hard to be precise.  Two days later i bought an 8 ball and have been smoking since.  Im so depressed and upset.  idk what to do.  The coke makes me even more depressed when it wares off and im not addicted to coke but i spent  a total of 375 and am ruining my sobriety. 

I love this woman with all my heart but she's putting me down and calling me a loser so much and makes me feel like why be sober.  I know she's winning  but I just say fuck everything when she breaks my heart
 
I know I need to leave her, but how do I get my self respect back and not feel like im better off dead. I bought the 8 ball in hopes deep down that i would overdose and just end it. 

Where do I go for help? And what can I do to feel like a human being again? I know what I gotta do but I can't get there. I have no one to talk to. And i feel so worthless to the person id do anything for.

Historically we've been taking drugs together since we were 16 - both of us have had moments where things have been out of control but I've massively cut down my drug usage and generally confine it to a couple of parties/festivals a year. About 5 years ago, just before he got married he was living in London and I was in the countryside - one evening we were all hanging out and he took me to one side and told me how bad his cocaine use had got - to the point he was doing a lot every day and hiding it from his fiancée. We had a heart to heart and agreed that he needed to tell her about it and seek help - she's a nurse and generally quite understanding. It wasn't pretty but they got through it and as far as I was aware he'd got it back under control. 

Fast forward to my birthday last year and he bought an 8th of coke for us to take with us on holiday - I told him I didn't really want to do loads of coke as I've been trying to enjoy life sober as much as possible. When we were on holiday he confided to me that he had then done the entire 8th to himself in one night and he still had a coke problem. I vowed at that point to stop doing any coke with him ever to make sure I wasn't enabling him at all and have tried my best to check in regularly with him to see how he's holding up - and every time I ask he says he's fine. 

Fast forward again to the weekend just gone - I was hanging out with another friend in our group, we got really pissed and this guy told me he was really worried about my friend; apparently he's spent about 9 grand on coke over the last year and is really deep into it again. This guy asked me not to confront my friend as he'll know who told me about it; I'm guessing the reason he's not sharing this stuff with me anymore is because I'm not doing it with him anymore and he knows I'll grill him about it but I'm really worried - I'm definitely going to confront him about it when I get the chance. I know another huge worry for him is what his wife will say - they've just had a kid and he's a great husband/father but I think if she found out that he was back into it in such a big way and hiding it from her she'd probably leave him. I'm not sure whether to potentially involve his parents - his father is fairly sympathetic when it comes to drug use and would probably be really supportive, and not out him to his wife. 

Has anyone dealt with a situation like this and have any thoughts on how best I can approach this? I have my demons but I've never struggled with being able to give up drugs when I've needed to so I don't really know what I can say to him other than encouraging him to stop and supporting wherever I can",3,0

I enjoyed the attention I got from the dancers. I enjoyed the $150 VIP lap dances I got from them. I enjoyed that I was allowed to touch them too. One girl there I asked if she did anything else outside the club and she said yes and came over to my apartment after her shift and I paid her $800 to have sex and I lost my virginity. I’ve never been in a relationship and until then was a virgin at age 23 and it weighed and still does heavily on me. I basically spent my whole paycheck on her and various dances at this club. Not to mention I used up all $2000 I had in cash savings too. I had enough to pay my bills but as I get paid bi-weekly, I’ve been struggling to get by these past two weeks. This Friday, I’m getting paid quite a bit since I worked a lot, and I’m really afraid I’ll spend it again on that prostitute and more VIP dances. I’m afraid I’ll be broke for another two weeks. I have an addictive personality. And Again never being in a relationship has led me to being emotionally starved I guess and paying for attention and time for girls is better than having none. I’m terrible with women. I honestly believe I’ll never be with anyone unless I pay them now. But for money reasons I know this is viable. I really hate what I’m becoming. I don’t know what to do to stop it. I don’t want to be alone forever but again, paying for companionship is better than none. I hate myself.

I am a (20)female and I have been heavily abusing amphetamines for the past 2 years. I have been prescribed them for the past 5 years. I was totally in control of meds and actually 100% needed them until 2 years ago I fell off the wagon. I had always been severely add/adhd. My teachers in school loved to point that out and I knew it as well. I could never just sit there and absorb information or learn like everyone else around me. My mom never believed in meds until 2016 when my grades really started to drop. Immediately after beginning meds I improved so much in school. The first time I took them I wanted to cry because of how much of a change they made. I had never been able to listen retain a single word of anything taught to me or remember anything I needed to do until now. I finally felt normal. Once I got to college in 2019, I was still completely in controlled and had never abused it until one day I accidentally took an additional dosage. I felt euphoria like never before and that was it. I was hooked. From that day forward I continued to abuse it. I went from taking 20mg twice a day of IR adderall to convincing my doc to up my dosage to 30mg IR twice a day. That wasn’t enough. Before upping my dose I’d take 100-120mg a day. Then I began taking 120-140 mg a day. I’d run out early and either suffer from withdrawal or buy more from a friend. I’d visit home just to steal my siblings vyvanse. I even started seeing another doctor back home in addition to the one out of town prescribing me my adderall. I was getting 60 IR 30mg adderall and 60mg vyvanse from two different doctors. This has been the case for the past year. I’ll take up to 240mg of vyvanse a day or mix the two together. Until last month, my doctors never caught on. I now can’t get the adderall so I’m stuck with vyvanse and stealing my siblings adderall. Every single day I take at least 90-240mg of amphetamines. 
Not a single person knows about this. I have had to drop out of college (twice) I tell myself it’s mental health but it’s all just spiraling from this abuse. Ive been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression and medicated for that as well. 
I don’t want to quit either. I love any add/adhd drug the world has to offer. 
I don’t do any other drugs either. I used to smoke occasionally but I had a panic attack randomly the last time and never want to experience that again. 
I know that I should quit. I’m constantly looking online for other people like me so I can feel normal. I’ll see people hooked on meth heroin etc and think I’m fine bc I could be doing something worse. 

I’m sharing all of this because I have never admitted this to anyone. I really fucking love taking this shit every morning. I just know deep down this can’t be normal. 2 years I’ve been hooked and haven’t been sober for more than 5-7 days at a time since. Thank you to whoever reads this for listening",23,0
